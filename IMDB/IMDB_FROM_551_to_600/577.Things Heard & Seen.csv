0,nogodnomasters,I don't paint anymore,5,28 May 2021,"George Claire (James Norton) accepts a job as a professor in Saginaw, New York at Hudson Valley. He buys a murder farmhouse, information which he hides from his bulimic trophy wife Catherine (Amanda Seyfried) and daughter. George is not the upstanding citizen we were lead to believe and his life becomes unraveled at the same time his wife and daughter are dealing with ghosts. The community are followers of Emanuel Swedenborg who believed in portals between this world and the afterlife.This film has nothing to do with Amber Heard rumors. Amanda Seyfried gives us a good performance in a film that that grabbed me, but let me go at the end. Can't we have an alternative ending?Guide: F-word. Implied sex. Brief partial nudity.",Things Heard & Seen
1,kosmasp,Cannot be unseen (?) and unheard (?),7,8 May 2021,"The movie sets out a mood that is quite ... good to say the least. You really get into the movie and its characters and maybe learn things about them, that make them not as likeable (some of them). Of course there seem to be warning signs on one of them - but the depths this goes ... incredible! What I personally liked, was seeing the aftermath of a horrible act and not the horrible act itself - though horrible may be a definition thing for some - what do you consider horrible or just plain morally wrong? Maybe you even think it is justified ... although that would make me question your morals on more than one occasion.As at least another reviewer said though, the ending is quite ... weak. Which is the last impression you have of a movie. What was not disclosed and what I can't tell you either at the moment is at what moment (time wise) you should turn off and make up the rest on your own. I just know that the movie seems to pander to both sides - trying to shock but also appease. It may look good, but you may have issues to totally understand certain things ... especially an out there decision being made by one of the main characters ... way out there, but still in frame! (puns very much intended) - but you may feel different about it of course and think this is the best solution to this ever. Though why the awake(ning) then? Well you can't win them all, now can you? And up to that point it really is more than well made.",Things Heard & Seen
2,Sleepin_Dragon,"Good, until the ending.",6,9 September 2021,"What a bizarre, curious movie this was, classified on Netflix as a horror, it is most definitely not a horror, I'd place it more in the thriller genre.Production values are superb, and the acting is first rate, both James Norton and Amanda Seyfried put in first rate performances, the pair are superb.Each scene where I saw Norton's white vest popping through the top of his jumper, I saw Sidney Chambers, British fans will of course be familiar with Granchester.Despite the amazing acting, and the very atmospheric start, I find it hard to forgive the ending, this is a movie in the category of, how not to end a film, it sucks, it's unoriginal, and the movie deserved more.Overall, very well acted, good story, a poor ending, it's worth a look, 6/10.",Things Heard & Seen
3,BandSAboutMovies,Ah blah,4,13 May 2021,"Based on All Things Cease to Appear by Elizabeth Brundage, this movie reminded me equally of Cold Creek Manor and What Lies Beneath, except that it really makes great use of Thomas Cole and the Hudson River School of painters.Catherine Clare (Amanda Seyfried) had a career as an art restorer in Manhattan until her husband George (James Norton) lies his way into a job teaching art history in Chosen, New York. In their new home, Catherine finds an old ring and a Bible with the names of those who had once lived in the house scratched out.Much like the aforementioned Cold Creek Manor, the children of the last tenants come to help fix up the house. Beyond the supernatural feeling of the home, George starts sleeping around and alienating his wife from any relationships that she starts to form.By the end of the film, George has gone from bad husband to pretty much a supervillain, taking the paintings of his dead cousin as his own, attacking anyone who will keep his perfect life from continuing and spitting profanity at anyone near him.But hey! Michael O'Keefe from Caddyshack shows up, as does Karen Allen as his wife. F. Murray Abraham is - as always - dependable. And the ending is pretty wide open to interpretation, as is a scene where Catherine pulls a flesh-colored tadpole out of the sink while she's trying to get her ring out of the drain.Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini have directed several movies together, including The Nanny Diaries, Girl Most Likely and American Splendor.A lot of reviews of this movie have been upset that the film seems to be building to something and just kind of ends. As for me, that was the thing that I really liked. It just gets wild at the end and enters a world where things don't make sense. Then again, I like the ending of The Beyond and my taste is not to be trusted at all.",Things Heard & Seen
4,Calicodreamin,predictable bore,4,30 April 2021,"While this film tries very hard to be edgy and psychological, it just ends up being a predictable bore. The acting is decent but the storyline is drawn out and meandering. The scary parts aren't scary and the thriller parts aren't thrilling.",Things Heard & Seen
5,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Ridiculous horror farrago,4,11 May 2021,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningGeorge Claire (James Norton), a lecturer, and his wife Catherine (Amanda Seyfried) move in to a new home in a remote location, with their daughters Franny (Ana Sophia Claire) and Audrey (Kristen Griffith.) There is a history within the house that follows it around, and it soon becomes clear that there is a ghostly presence in the place. As Catherine becomes closer to handyman Eddie (Alex Neustaedter) and tensions and indiscretions mount between the couple, it all builds to a horrifying conclusion.Out of nowhere, Netflix offers up it's latest offering, a spooky supernatural effort from joint directors Shari Springer Bergman and Robert Pulcini. Originality doesn't seem to be the order of the day, with the contrived, cliched set up of a haunted house. While this never leaves your mind, Bergman and Pulcini's film has far more to contend with than merely this.The two directors have quite lofty ambitions for such a familiar plot line, but wind up with an overlong and overwrought piece of work that desperately tries to be something more, but ends up all convoluted, building up to an incomprehensible ending that many others have struggled to make sense of. Norton and Seyfried create a convincing chemistry as the married young couple whose happy set up is creaking beneath the surface, but trapped within the confines of such unsustainable material, it's all just wasted.It may have been intended as a creative new take on a well trodden story, but it winds up as something best neither seen or heard. **",Things Heard & Seen
6,cruise01,What did i watch.,4,13 May 2021,2 out of 5 stars.Boring horror thriller film. Which the plot is boring and forgettable. Cast ensemble gave a tedious performance. Lacks thrills and horror. And the ending was a wtf moment that left you with no other thought about the movie.,Things Heard & Seen
7,Tweetienator,Wrong Path,5,25 June 2021,"Well, I have no news for you - the ending... Anyway, Things Heard & Seen works well as a drama about a failing relationship (fine performances by Amanda and the other actors) and maybe a turn into the direction of a crime/thriller would have worked well, but that touch of mystery and horror added destroys (almost) everything - it does feel very disjointed and rides on the path of stereotypes of that kind of movies. Somewhat still okay.",Things Heard & Seen

A good film, entertaining, strange outcome, I liked it ..",Things Heard & Seen
9,jtindahouse,Didn't need to be a ghost story,7,4 May 2021,"I actually really enjoyed 'Things Heard & Seen' but as I was watching it I kept thinking to myself, why is this a ghost story? The real life characters are interesting and have more than enough depth to carry the story by themselves. The things that they do are interesting, not what's happening to them. I assume it came from a place of wanting to sell the story as a horror movie, but even then the film is very rarely scary.The film is long for the genre coming in slightly over 2 hours. This can be a risk because if your film isn't good then it can feel extremely long and tedious to watch. Luckily 'Things Heard & Seen' is strong enough to justify it and what's more the extra length let's the story develop at a more natural pace. The film isn't afraid to get very dark at times either. There is one particularly brutal scene near the end that I wasn't expecting (even though it was cleverly foreshadowed).If you like a ghost story then there is probably enough of that going on here to keep you interested. If you don't like ghost stories then don't be too put off by that being present here. There's more than enough other stuff going on that you can pretty much just ignore that element and enjoy the rest like I did. I had a good time with 'Things Heard & Seen' and would say it is worth your time.",Things Heard & Seen
10,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Things Heard & Seen,8,13 May 2021,"8/10 - while I agree with other reviewers that the ending was a little underwhelming, this was all-in-all a captivating horror thriller that kept unraveling and peaking my curiosity.",Things Heard & Seen
11,alindsay-al,A Poor Boring Film,3,29 April 2021,"This film made its way to Netflix today and I managed to find two hours spare so I watched it and here is my review for Things Heard and Seen. The premise of the film sees a couple move to The Hudson Valley where things start to unravel and there might even be supernatural forces in play.Main Character
Amanda Seyfried and James Norton plays the two leads here and they both do okay jobs. Neither of their characters are particularly interesting but they are clearly two talented performers and they try to make the most out of what they have and that is some pretty good qualities. But you won't care about either of these two characters or there plights as it is just really dull and mundane with very little reason given as to really why these characters are in this situation.Supporting Characters
The amazing Rhea Seehorn is here and she is obviously the best part of the film having some great scenes and she is the best character in the film. This is the first thing I have seen her in since watching Better Call Saul and it is great to see that she is still really good here and despite every other part of the film faltering she doesn't for one moment. F. Murray Abraham is in this film and he is decent but his character is a bit all over the place but he is a presence on screen and it is nice to see him here. But the rest of the cast just play these generic characters that offer very little whether it be the young performers or Karen Allen of Indiana Jones fame they are bland.Story
This story is absurd and not in a good way. It just doesn't work, despite a few okay performances there is nobody to really latch onto and the whole supernatural element is wasted and feels just like a reason for a wacky ending and to stretch this film to 2 hours long. It has plenty of clichés and the last act in particular is just ridiculous and comes out of nowhere and makes these characters feel more like actors playing roles then real people. Plus the awful ending and you have a pretty terrible plot.Script
The script is also bad, the dialogue does nothing to enhance the plot or its characters. It just comes across as mixed convoluted and basic and these two styles just don't mix and make this a nightmare of ideas put into one film.Style
The style of the film looks okay, it does a half decent job of showing the small scale of the place that this couple moves too and has some decent camera work and cinematography. But this film is just really boring and its pacing is lacklustre. This film should never been so long and probably could have done away with the whole supernatural aspect and it might have been a slightly better film.Overall
Overall, Things Heard & Seen is a poor movie. It just lacks any interest or intrigue, it is too slow and when it does try something shocking it fails at it. Give this one a miss.",Things Heard & Seen
12,kwenchow,"Another worst horror film! Full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Avoid at all cost!",1,21 May 2021,"This film start with a series of picture been projected, and a man ""George"" seeing blood dripping on his car's windshield scene! As turnout, this film is about George committed a series of crime, and eventually kill by the joined spirit of his wife, and the spirit in his house!

13,henry8-3,Things Heard and Seen,3,3 May 2021,"Seyfried and Norton and their daughter move to where Norton has just got a job as an arts professor. Seyfried is interested in the local community and starts to look into the strange history of her house, prompted by strange ghostly goings on.Uneven blend of thriller, where Norton may not be quite what he purports to be and a haunted house story. The difficulty is that the two overlap rather uncomfortably and seem almost in competition with each other for screen time such that when you become interested in one, it stops and swaps to the other rather jarringly, like 2 separate films. The performances are ok and Norton particularly is good at being a bad guy. Utterly loses it towards the end though making little sense either in the real or spiritual world. Messy.",Things Heard & Seen
14,yusufpiskin,Things about Amanda,6,11 May 2021,"Horror is definitely one of my favorite genres. I find this type of film extremely impactful when done right. From sleepless nights to unforgettable images, I can never get enough of horror. However, just like every other popular genre, it reached a point where studios care more about building franchises set on formulaic screenplays than actually delivering original, creative, unique stories. Netflix isn't known for exceptional horror content, so I was skeptical going into this movie.Things Heard & Seen may hold a generic premise, but Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini are able to add enough substance to make it interesting. Amanda Seyfried (Mank) and James Norton (Little Women) offer two remarkable performances, portraying two distinct characters that somehow ended up together. Both have their own flaws, but the husband is depicted in such a negative manner that it becomes challenging to follow someone so despicable. The main narrative offers a slight twist on the usual ghost story, making it more than just a creepy jumpscare festival, as well as possessing a particularly violent scene that's no short of surprising.Despite the suspenseful atmosphere, the slow pacing drags an overlong film that unfortunately features an underwhelming ending. The beginning of the third act reaches the peak of excitement, boasting attention-grabbing character decisions that will surely raise the entertainment value. Sadly, the mix of feminist themes with the supernatural narrative is far from getting the right balance, ending as yet another horror flick that had everything to be much, much better.",Things Heard & Seen
15,Pairic,Seyfried In Another Haunted House,6,29 April 2021,"Things Heard & Seen: Amanda Seyfried finds herself in yet another haunted house and yes - her relationship is disturbed. This time she has largely sacrificed her artistic career to move to upstate New York where her husband, James Norton, has been appointed as a professor at a private college. Swedenborg and his teachings feature in the film, and the area where it's set was a seedbed for his followers. The house itself is soon a hotbed of poltergeist and other ghostly activities. Even a seance is held there. Seyfried discovers that the house has a sinister past and her husband is also hiding secrets. Mostly psychological horror but there are several murders and attempted murders including an ax attack. A Gothic haunted house thriller which is overlong at 121 minutes., it might have worked better with 20 minutes shaved off it's running time. Still worth watching though. Written & Directed by Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pucini. On Netflix. 6/10.",Things Heard & Seen
16,ks-60500,When Shinning meet What lies beneath,4,1 May 2021,Quite Alrite with old movie concept with adding new elements. It's a bit long and horror part not that advanced. But still good with the storyline.,Things Heard & Seen
17,I_Ailurophile,Potential gone to waste,4,3 June 2021,"I didn't know much about this going in. I watched a trailer before it was released, but it didn't impart much. One can't help but notice the names in the cast: Seyfried, Dyer, Abraham, Allen, Urbaniak. I gathered a sense that it's not received well, but that doesn't inherently stop me from checking out a movie.Unfortunately, in this instance, I'm inclined to agree with the naysayers: 'Things heard & seen' isn't a film that one particularly needs to hear, or see.The cast has certainly more than proven themselves elsewhere, and they do what they can, here, with what they are given. But there's simply no subtlety to be found here, neither in the dialogue, nor in the execution of scenes generally. Catherine (Seyfried) sees a book in passing? The camera emphatically focuses on that book, and she picks it up. George (James Norton) has a scene? He's going to be a creep. A scene features a young child? The camera will focus on them in such a way as to play up the trope of spooky children. Characters who shouldn't be flirting, are flirting? They'll be super obvious about it. All this is to say nothing of how characters repeatedly make astoundingly terrible decisions.There are themes and ideas broached in the screenplay that are worth exploring, but they are touched upon here with the same forceful lack of nuance. I'm not familiar with the book 'All things cease to appear,' by Elizabeth Brundage, that this is based on. But Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini, sharing roles as writers and directors, lean extremely hard into that directness, and it's decidedly off-putting.It's not all bad. As one might say about a house, the narrative has good bones; there are some good ideas here. But the plot is awash in such a gross lack of refinement as to blot out what value it may have had. And while fashioning itself a ghost story, the spiritualist element of the story suffers from the same quality - while also mostly vanishing from the screenplay in the second act. I don't particularly like ghost stories as it is - they generally just seem so silly to me - and this hasn't helped their case.I wanted to like this. I like the cast, and I see potential in the threads of the story. But the execution is terribly flawed, and all is for naught. 'Things heard & seen' just isn't very worthwhile.",Things Heard & Seen
18,AnnaPagrati,Great movie!,9,30 August 2021,Amanda is honestly so talented! The plot is great!,Things Heard & Seen
19,Kamurai25,"""The Professor's Wife""",6,19 June 2021,"Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.I'll be honest, I was a little tired when I watched it, but I had a good time.This is a good movie that I feel could have been a great movie, but I feel like its concept causes a distraction from it's own story.The movie does some clever things that make it a little hard to not spoil it, but giving the main character debilitations doesn't automatically make her more sympathetic. I'm sure it makes her more relatable to certain audience and even more realistic a person, as a lot of her characteristics are the result of an unhappy relationship, but it doesn't really drive the story on its own.Once the momentum of the story, the house, and the characters start to build, the movie really becomes something else. There seems to be a new trend in movie making, that this story shares, where the story ends and a new story begins. Its not quite the same as having a 4th act or having 2 3-act stories. It's close to having a short sequel in the same movie, and that's definitely what it feels like.This gets a lot of points for being interesting and having a great cast and delivery, but it's just not...""great"" as a whole.",Things Heard & Seen

24,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Started off well but quickly plummets.,5,30 April 2021,"I felt the film started off well but quickly plummets. It totally unravels to a terrible disconnected plot. The film seemed more interested in pushing the normal #woke politics of today's tv shows. Namely implying females=victim, good; males=toxic aggressor, victimizer instead of making a good story.The acting performances were very good. The cinematography with the hidden ghosts inside the shadows and doorways were well done. It's unfortunate the story isn't more complex and interesting with the original builders of the home and the current home homeowners.Netflix doesn't seem to know whether they want to make this film a supernatural horror, psychopath horror, or demonic horror?

Murray Abraham was amazing, the whole set was great, the cinematography was amazing, most of the perfomance was alright except James Norton, i'm just not a big fan of his perfomance in here, again, it's not a bad movie but not a great movie too, some of a scene was good, there is some of a scene that bad, and some of a scene just silly, overall Things Heard & Seen is somehow just too exaggerated but not completely awful""",Things Heard & Seen

And more so, what was up with the ending. It felt abrupt and it came from nowhere. I'm not talking about the artwork of the book that established the connection, but rather the decisions that brought George Claire into that situation.I'd enjoy a rather darker ending with the film being 25-30 minutes shorter.In its current state, it is okay but leaves you asking what was the point of all that quality writing and acting.",Things Heard & Seen

31,apryla-58795,Amanda wears some bomba*s sweaters in this,8,1 May 2021,"A couple move to a small college town and soon their seemingly idyllic life comes apart in very sinister ways.I don't know why this is getting such hate. I am usually a very harsh critic but I thought this was pretty good. The acting was solid from everyone. The story was the same ol' same ol' but I was really into this from start to finish. I actually didn't want it to end. I liked the whole small college town vibe. I also liked how it was kind of shot in warm darker light. There was so much going on that honestly they pry could've made this into a series and fleshed out the characters and the backstory a bit more.Some reviewers felt this was too slow and didn't go anywhere but I felt it moved along at a decent pace and it certainly did have a resolution although sadly a bit too abrupt for me as I felt it was just getting really good when it ended. Too many people these days don't have the attention span to appreciate an interesting film-which is not a legit reason to give it a low rating.I didn't think Amanda's character would really die at the end even though it showed that it looked that way from the beginning.I also feel those poor brothers just kept getting traumatized. They needed to move away and get a fresh start from all that drama and evil. They were just left forgotten about with no one coming to their aid after their lives were blown up again.Also it would have been nice to see the husband pay for what he did instead of him being able to decide how his life would end.The only thing that bothers me is why do most films have to portray the husband as being reprehensible? That gets a little tired, cliche and lazy on the writer or director's part.Lastly some of the visuals were clearly fake (bad cgi) and anymore there is no excuse for that.Netflix isn't great anymore but this film redeemed them a bit in my book.",Things Heard & Seen

Interesting plotting that is Lifetime influenced mixture of supernatural and domestic drama. The largest problem is that neither quite works, and neither is quite enough for a film.

33,phenomynouss,"""Ghosts made me a bad person""?",4,30 May 2021,"Apparently the biggest complaint among negative reviews was the ending? I admit I didn't get it, but that was the least of all the problems of this film.I usually don't like getting into spoilers, but the unusual or otherwise confused theme of this film forces me to.Initially this movie seems to be toying with stereotypical ""haunted house"" ghostiness, with a young husband and wife, George and Catherine, and their daughter Franny moving to a new tiny town where George is newly hired as an art professor. Some minor spooky ghosty happenings happen in the house around Catherine and George is skeptical, as is the typical fashion.At some point in comes Willis, a young college student going to a different college but in town on vacation who talks to George and George gets a little crush on. Inexplicably, she's inviting him to her barn for sex all of a sudden.What had appeared to be a near perfect marriage at the start suddenly and abruptly seems to have completely deteriorated as George and Catherine are now constantly fighting. To the film's credit, the source of their conflicts feel genuine, like this was something that had been brewing for a while long before they moved here.Their marital conflicts become more uncomfortable and more terrifying than the ghostly activity, which I loved and thought set the stage for some truly innovative and fun stuff.The subtle rate at which George is revealed to be a narcissistic creep is very well done, and at times even plays into the drama around the haunted house narrative. At some point close to the end, however, the film seems to have come up with a decision as to how to push forth the supernatural narrative...Catherine is seeing and hearing the ghosts of women who were murdered by their husbands, and George is seeing and hearing the ghosts of the murderous husbands.I don't know how this plays out in the novel the film is based on, but in the film it almost seems to threaten to come across as a cheap cop-out for domestic abuse. ""Ghosts made me abuse my wife and harass her friends and cheat on her with a girl half my age"", it seems to be teasing us with as a potential explanation.There's no indication anywhere in the film, whether directly via some dumb expo-dump, or indirectly via the actors to indicate whether this violent behavior from George is coming from him as a result of his public facade coming apart, or if it's being directly driven by spooky ghosts talking to him.Whether the latter makes it somehow cheap or insulting I cannot say, but the lack of clarity was all I could think about well past the ending, to the point where whatever message it was trying to get across got drowned out.",Things Heard & Seen

Easiest way to kill it is to just give in.""A Manhattan artist relocates her young family to a historic hamlet in the Hudson Valley. As she settles into a new life, she begins to suspect that her marriage has a sinister darkness, one that rivals her new home's history. Things Heard and Seen didn't have much of a chance from the very details we were given. The most that it could get was being an ok movie. To my surprise it actually made it to that mark. However, this is one that will be forgotten quickly. Actually, I don't think it's even in the top viewed on Netflix only a short time after. The story is ok. It never goes anywhere exciting and new. Everything plays out as expected. The biggest weakness comes from the runtime. At just 2 hours long, it's such a drag. There is no reason for it to be as long as it is. But for some reason, we have a prolonged slow-burn that lacked excitement. I feel like the ending is supposed to be shocking or something big at least, however, I found it to be quite a waste. Maybe it's because of how everything is setup. Nevertheless, it's just kind of there.For a ghost story, this feels more like a drama surrounding a marriage. That part, I did find some interest. There's many issues within the marriage of Catherine and George that it's hard not to get the least bit interested. Amanda Seyfried carried this movie. She is good in it and tries her best to keep it all together. Last year she got stuck with another disappointing horror movie called You Should Have Left. We know she can act and her time is finally shining through with her recent Oscar nomination earlier this year. Most of the acting is good, in fact. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to give it the flare needed. I can see where the movie wanted to go, and it does setup well in the beginning.

I get the husband is supposed to have a ""sinister darkness,"" but still. Why make him a ""talented painter"" only to reveal that he doesn't paint at all? Most, I mean ALL, spouses would know if their partner is a painter of considerable talent.That's just one question this movie doesn't bother answering.Why the eating disorder?What was the purpose of Eddie and Cole...and Franny, and Willis?What was the purpose of the ghosts?So much pointless character development and pointless characters.Why weren't they newlyweds? Too much clutter in what should have been a fairly entertaining ""ghost gets even with psycho husband"" flick.I don't know much about Amanda Seyfried. She's been in some entertaining films; Chloe, Jennifer's Body and I guess a few others...here, I think she does well with what she's given. The acting all around is competent. As a Better Call Saul fan, it was great seeing Rhea Seehorn in something outside her Kim Wexler role.Since we're all talking about the ending, I'll offer my take. What the film got right was filming on location. The Hudson Valley is beautiful and the use of Hudson River School art and imagery, added depth. Where the ending failed was making the painting, that was shown throughout the movie, a literal portal to Hell.I'm all for a poetic ending, but here it's confusing and misplaced.After all that came before it, we're supposed to accept that his murdered wife's ghost teamed up with another ""benevolent"" dead wife (of the previous owners I think) and somehow were able to exact revenge.I will say - even with all the problems of this movie - I'll score it a 5, because I think all involved tried.

The very ending tho is a metaphorical one, but not quite a clear one so it can be confusing. Polanski's ""Ninth Gate"" comes to mind. Not a clear winner by any means, but not impossibly bad either.As for the rest of the movie, this is a real winner, production, cinematography, acting etc are top notch. This is on a completely different level than most ""direct-to-Netflix"" horrors, it's very very well made, it's more about if viewer will get the ending or not. It's not exactly horror movie either as many think, there's just one gory scene - which actually ruined the movie for me - I felt it was totally unnecessarily graphic and took away power from the the more metaphorical and thinker ending. I really dislike the one scene as this was otherwise very atmospheric, mostly everything else was left for viewer to imagine and decide themselves.Not a perfect movie, but definitely better than many reviews make it seem.",Things Heard & Seen
55,danybur,A marital drama about the fearsome,7,9 May 2021,"Summary:First of all, let's clarify that we are not looking at a traditional horror movie but a conjugal drama with fantastic elements that takes place mostly, yes, in what we could call a haunted house. That is why it unleashes the ire of viewers and certain critics who lose their position in the face of a combination of genres or a different approach to them or of those who confuse their intentions with those of those who made the film. In short, they cannot read where the terrifying sits, they do not recognize it.Developed with a good narrative pulse, is a production that despite its length maintains interest, is filmed with a beautiful photograph and that, consistent with its premise and style, fortunately avoids the gratuitous underlines of so many traditional horror films.Review:George Claire (James Norton, seen in Happy Valley and The Nevers) is an art history professor who gets a recommendation to practice at a small university in upstate New York. His wife Catherine (Amanda Seyfried, whom we recently saw in First Reformed) is a restorer who agrees to accompany him to his new destination with their young daughter. The family settles in an old house with a dark past where disturbing phenomena soon begin to manifest themselves.First of all, let's clarify that we are not looking at a traditional horror movie but a conjugal drama with fantastic elements that takes place mostly, yes, in what we could call a haunted house. That is why it unleashes the ire of viewers or certain critics who lose their position in the face of a combination of genres or a different approach to them or those who confuse their intentions with those of those who made the film.Actually, it is a film similar to The Nest: the new house sets in motion a marital crisis that was latent because it unmasks the personality of her husband. In The Appearance of Things, the film rightly accompanies the point of view of both members of the couple and describes how, in some way, the house ""accompanies"" this crisis. And as for her approach to the genre, she follows the line of Babadook or Hereditary in terms of privileging drama.In much of the film of Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini a couple drama dominates where the divergent paths that both spouses begin to travel and the incidence of some secondary characters in it are developed with a calm but without pause. The fantastic backdrop relates to the ideas of the afterlife of the 18th century Swedish theologian Swedenborg and to the object of study of George, the 19th century painter George Innes, a follower of Swedenborg and one of whose works illustrates the cover of one of his books. But the introduction of the film had already warned us that something serious happened in the house and the film enters a later stage of its development into the terrain of the thriller, as a logical culmination of the accumulated tensions (although one regrets the breakdown of the calm narrative balance of the first part).Seyfried and Norton are perfect in their roles, as well as Rhea Seehorn as Catherine's new friend, in a production that despite its length maintains interest and is filmed with a beautiful photograph, which fortunately avoids the underlining of so many horror films and whose key question would be where does the terrifying lie? It seems that many viewers are unable to see it.",Things Heard & Seen

You can't help liking the movie. It was set at a small elitist Hudson Valley college called ""Saginaw?"". But it was shot in the Hudson Valley Dutchess County NY and set in 1980. Some smarmy arts academic twit lands a cushy arts history teaching job at this in this small upstate NY town, He drags his anorexic artist wife and his daughter along with him to this old farmhouse that is creepy and seemingly haunted. Of course, there was a terrible murder-suicide there in the recent past that the scummy husband withheld that news from his nervous wife. If you are familiar with a raft of movies from the Amityville Horror to Sinister, that is never a good thing. Besides, in a small town and college community, how long could that salient feature about her new house could be kept secret from her? The leads were pretty good, you can't help but feel protective of poor little pop-eyed Amanda Seyfried put-upon character of Catherine Claire, the harried wife and mother taken away from her NYC home. Her wretched husband George was played by James Norton, was perfect for his role, he just oozed sleaziness and weakness at the same time with his sleazy smile. He lied and cheated on everything, from forging a recommendation from his doctoral advisor for a degree he never got because he liked to grab cute young co-ed at his grad school, to the paintings he stole from his dead cousin and claimed as his. He even drive a Peugeot. But his charm worked on his new boss and department head played by the avuncular F. Murray Abraham as Floyd DeBeers. He also landed a local filly, a smart alec elitist brat who was taking time off from Cornel as a horse riding instructor. Then there are the two sons of the previous dead murder-suicide parent owners of the old dairy farm who come to the new owners' service as both a baby-sitter and handy man.Okay, I don't want to write a synopsis, but there is a supernatural angle to all this. It all starts with the academic pursuit of our villain, who researched this 19th century painter who was influenced by a mystic called Swedenborg, both real people. Apparently Swedenborg had this philosophy that what we do in our life was mirrored in the afterlife. But to cut to the quick, their old farmhouse had ghosts of the previous housewives who were murdered by their hubbies (the 19th century wife of the original owner died mysteriously, presumed murdered too) , and these ghosts were trying to warn our hapless Catherine by signaling her by ghostly presence and doing things like blowing up their kid's night light when George lies to her. She even has a séance where all the fringe clique at the college see this poltergeist. But along with these good ghosts is some bad male ones that secretly make George even worse than his previous normal lying cheating self.I like these sort of small town country and collegiate set ups, it is very 70s and early 80s vibe to it. It is a fun movie but as most people commented, the ending was weak. Maybe the original book had more to offer but the screen writers had to shoe horn into a time frame.

I saw this the moment the kid knocked on the door and I was praying it wouldn't be so. Also what was the significance of the ring? Why was it so hard to remove?

71,el7,"A haunting mystery, solved.",8,30 April 2021,"Beautifully shot, scored, edited and acted, Things Heard & Seen is heavily influenced by the art that inspired it, that being the works of Swedenbourg and Innes; and of course of the novelist Elizabeth Brundage upon whose ""All Things Cease to Appear"" this screenplay is based. The movie is less opaque about what happened than the novel, but it also leaves one particular murder a mystery through most of its runtime, whereas the novel lets you know straight up front who got killed (just not why or by whom, and it may keep you guessing on that point after you put the book down). The set decorator and wardrobe department also deserve kudos, because this movie is set right at that point where the 1970's is turning into the 1980's but hasn't fully gone over yet, and it feels like that time period in every frame.The movie introduces us to Catherine (Amanda Seyfried) who is a respected art restorer in New York City, and also mother to four year-old Franny by husband George (James Norton). George has finally gotten is PhD and received an offer to teach at a small liberal arts college in upstate New York. He wants to move his family out of the city and into an old farmhouse. Catherine and Franny are initially the most sensitive to the paranormal presence in the house, but George catches up later.This movie does have ghosts in it, neither the movie nor the book were ever coy about that. The ghosts do some pretty frightening things, but as the film progresses you realize that the ghosts are not the scariest part of this story. The truly chilling character is a living one. I won't spoil that for you, but I will say that even if you guess who it is early in the runtime, you might not guess the craven depths this character will go to in the name of propping up a false sense of self. Just when you think you know the worst, some new tidbit pops up, and the pacing is just marvelous, so this never feels over the top.I won't go so far as to say this movie has a happy ending. It does have a satisfying ending.

The script totally ruins all the good that can come out, messy and incoherent at times. It integrates characters into the plot with a potential in the film that, in addition to not using them, they forget and lose their meaning, for example: Natalia Dyer and Alex Neustaedter. The spirits or paranormal activity that appear in the house is not clear why and the relationship that they establish so directly with the main ones at the end.Both James Norton and Amanda Seyfried did what they could, the first one tried to take the evolution of his character as natural as he could but the notoriously incoherent script did not help him and Seyfried the same, a great actress but she could not do much more.As a film that promised to be a more poetic or psychological terror, it had a long way to go and delve into states in the characters and scenes, none of them were scary or understood why it would have to be generated.",Things Heard & Seen

93,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Things Heard and Seen Was No Thrill,4,5 July 2021,"Hey Streamers, you know how sometimes you're just in a mood to see a horror movie? We'll that was me last night. So, after flipping through Prime Video and Netflix, I stopped upon a little known ditty, Things Heard and Seen. I had no clue about this movie until my wife said this looks interesting. Then, I saw it was based on a novel. ""Why not?,"" I thought. This movie is about a Manhattan artist reluctantly relocating her family to a historic town in the Hudson Valley. As the family begins to put down roots in this new life, the artist begins to notice a sinister darkness in her marriage that rivals that of her new home's past. A bit too close to home for me as I look to purchase a home myself, but that should make it even better. Right?Well, I was wrong. Not totally wrong but just not in a way that I was proud of myself for watching this. You know how a movie has promise but just fails in the end. Yeah, that happens here. The story has potential with the eeriness of the home and strangeness the husband's charming behavior. Yet, the movie never feels quite scary nor quite thrilling, which is not a good sign for a horror thriller. It only gets magnified as you inch towards the ending and the movie gets cheesier. There's a point where the ending beings to get good and then you feel emptiness like the last 2 hours basically was for nothing. That description is what I like to call a failure. You rope the viewer in just to give them nothing as a reward. I know that sounds terrible or harsh. I'm not going to take it back either. I know people may actually enjoy this movie as a Sunday afternoon time-filler-flick, but it's not even worth that to me. I will say there is some okay mystery in this movie that keeps you going. With that said, the cast does a pretty solid job led by Amanda Seyfried and James Norton. I think the direction could've been better and made the scenes more eerie or suspenseful but I guess they said, ""this is good enough"". It wasn't though.Needless to say based on this review, Things Heard and & Seen is a single popped kernel. The movie tries pretty hard but ultimately it falls flat. A horror, thriller that lacks true horror or thrilling moments is meant to be released through Netflix but doesn't need to be watched unless under duress.",Things Heard & Seen

The director put together all the pieces in a way that the things in the movie chain us up in a circle of suspense. One more thing that intrigues the audience is the unique performance that every actor has delivered. It makes you feel wholesome from time to time. The story seems quite interesting at first but with time as the film goes on it gets kind of boring right in the second arc. At the start of the third arc, it feels like that the movie shouldn't have been this long and in the end. This movie ends in a twisted way that definitely doesn't intrigue anything. Plot-wise this movie has some predecessors and compared to them the director tried to create something unique with this movie but overall it fell on the ground from way high. The screenplay could have been good if the story stayed strong to the roots until the end.

Yes it can be a little creepy, but it's SO much more than a regular film. In fact I haven't seen many like it.It deals with the subject of intimate partner abuse (emotional, psychological, physical etc.) which is still happening to many women ego do not even realize it.If you're a younger woman who think abuse happens to other people not us, watch it! If you're a young man who thinks there is no way you can ever abuse your wife, watch it! See how a man's behaviour can drag down the life if his family and his own.In real life, things aren't often so dramatic, fortunately.PS The ghosts are not just creepy things to scare you. They represent the learned behaviours that many men and women in our age still repeat and thus enable abusive relationships.Watch this film! It's not male-bashing.

There are a few tense moments. But overall the plot is pretty formulaic and predictable, even lazy in places.There are elements of Amityville to this, but time isnt really spent properly developing the mental decline of the main antagonist. Plus he's so ""bad"" that its often laughable - and that brings me to my final point - this is a horror made to honor the ""me too"" movement, its very feminine-power heavy. That works OK up to a point - but just watch it with that in mind.James Norton does OK as a creep, but he's not a very convincing killer. Overall, its not bad and worth a watch with low expectations.

For me it is chock full of academic references to art, literature, and academic careers. The story does a fine job of delving into the real human psyche including but not limited to issues of control (bulimia), deception (adultery, fake resumes, identity theft), grief (lots of lost loved ones), integrity (lots of good folks here trying to do the right thing), and guilt (only sociopaths don't feel guilty when they lie and murder).

131,halcyonbear,Restrained but all the better for it.,7,16 May 2021,"Some might not know what genre to place Things Heard and Seen into. Admittedly it does cross the boundaries between a straightforward drama and a horror/thriller. It's definitely cut from the same cloth as a lot of 19th century gothic works. If you are expecting an Amityville Horror style film with a ton of jump scares you will be disappointed. This story is much more restrained and is all the better for it. Whilst the supernatural is present, it doesn't take centre stage and acts as a metaphor for people being haunted by secrets and lies. It's certainly not the dead we need to fear in Things Heard and Seen. It's certainly not going to be to everyone's taste. The pacing is slower than in a lot of films, but this only builds the tension that such a story demands. It's a story that doesn't need to be pigeonholed.

All of our leads give an amazing performance especially Amanda Seyfried and James Norton plays his role perfectly.I enjoyed how this film was shot and the cinematography is very uniqueThe Bad- I found this film to be generic in it's set up. The movie is paced in a way where it takes a while for the story to finally get going. There are parts of the story which I feel should have been expanded and other parts that shouldn't of made it into the film.Overall Thoughts- This is a very mixed movie and one that audiences are going to be split on. Overall I'm going to give Things Heard & Seen a 5/10.,Things Heard & Seen

155,madsmartinussen,Weak on the horror,7,30 April 2021,"First of all, don't expect a horror movie, this is more of a supernatural thriller with a creepy atmosphere.I saw it on the release date, and it had already gotten pretty negative reviews. On top of that I don't expect a whole lot from Netflix movies, so I went in with very low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised.The film is intriguing, it works on the drama and mystery level, and though I'm not easily scared, I would say that the few horror elements in the film are pretty well done. The acting is solid all around, and the direction is capable.The thing is, and I'm guessing this is due to the fact that it's based on a book, the film tries to do too much. There are characters (Willis) and plot lines (Catherine's bulimia) that you imagine are important in the book, but fail to make the kind of impact on the film that they were clearly meant to. It's hard to go into detail without spoiling, but in short more emphasis on characters and main plot lines would have served the movie well. I have no doubt the source material is fantastic, but the movie could have done better if some of it had just been left in the book.Which brings us to the two hour run-time, some would argue that it would have been better if it was shorter, I would argue the that the length is what makes the film (mostly) work in the end.To sum up, a decent supernatural thriller, albeit with a bit too much going on.",Things Heard & Seen

158,JICNZ,Wasted Potential,3,20 May 2021,"As with many other reviewers here, I felt this was building up to be an excellent thriller. It wasn't very original (woman gives up her life in New York so her husband can take up a professorship in a rural upstate college teaching art history and the wife clearly resents this sacrifice) but it had a nice look and feel and some gorgeous locations in the collage and autumnal woods. But then it sort of lost its way, not sure what it was trying to be. Horror it is not, unless you have the constitution of a sickly kitten. Family drama I suppose. Cheating, lying husband, fed up wife. But then wife gets axe murdered, so hardly an enjoyable family drama. There are ghosts, but they could be just imagination. They certainly don't do anything to forward the story, so might as well not be there. Both husband and wife cheat, but that doesn't go anywhere. So all I car really say about this film is that it passed a dark winter's evening whilst knitting without taxing the old noggin. That's all I expect from movies these days.",Things Heard & Seen

I immediately disliked the character of George in the first five minutes who came off as arrogant, selfish and overbearing. I kept waiting for something to happen but everything was quite benign except for the large yawns coming from my mouth. It felt very What Lies Beneathish without the jump scares or story development. It was very lazily done, and the ending fell flat. What a waste of great talent.",Things Heard & Seen
174,Markyajv,Let's explain for those not too deep thinking. ...,7,1 May 2021,"The film follows a young married couple, Catherine (Oscar-nominee Amanda Seyfried) and George Clare (James Norton), who move from the city to the countryside when George accepts an art history teacher position at a small college. She's incredibly unhappy over being isolated from all of her family and friends, and her troubles are only compounded when strange occurrences start happening in their new home. All while that's taking place, dark truths about their marriage begin to come to light.It's definitely not your average horror flick. It's much quieter and takes its time with pacing to ensure the tense atmosphere can be maintained. As such, you may miss certain details, and in the event the ending to ""Things Heard & Seen"" left you puzzled, allow us to illuminate the darkness.Communing with the supernatural is something of a hobby in Chosen, New York, where the Clares move to. They know that better than anyone as a lot of strange things start happening in their new house like a nightlight flickering on and off. Catherine soon discovers that the house has a history of husbands killing their wives, and just like Chekhov's gun, that's exactly the same fate this married couple ends up in.Catherine realizes her husband killed one of his colleagues (and attempted to murder another) after they each uncovered one of the many lies he's told. One discovers that he forged a document in order to get the professor job while another uncovers his infidelity. It all comes down to George pulling a ""Shining"" and bringing an ax down on his wife while she's unconscious. In a way, it's like a prophecy being fulfilled as the violent cycle continues. Vengeful spirits remain in the house who seek to damn the husbands to lives in hellfire. And when we see Catherine again, she almost looks angelic as she's convened with another one of the spirits.She may have met an untimely end, but it would appear as though she's been saved. George, on the other hand ... not so much.You have to get a little philosophical to understand the ending of ""Things Heard & Seen."" George probably isn't literally sailing into a sea of flames, but rather, it's an allegory for how he's damned himself to Hell for his sins. Try as he might to cover up his misdeeds from forging documents to killing people, he couldn't escape them forever, as evidenced when one of his victims, Justine (Rhea Seehorn), wakes up from a coma. The last we see of her, she's ready to talk to the police.George believes the only way he can escape is by setting sail, but the camera zooms out to portray a painting that functions as a subversion of ""The Valley of the Shadow of Death"" from painter George Inness. He was a major proponent of the theological understandings presented by Emanuel Swedenborg, who's namedropped frequently in the movie. The original painting shows an individual walking through darkness, but at the end of the valley is an illuminated cross, symbolizing the eternal salvation of God. However, the final image of the film shows an upside-down cross surrounded by flames, showcasing how George's journey will have him suffering only to wind up in damnation.While it certainly sounds like a philosophically heavy movie, those who worked on it behind the scenes found a way to make it tie into current events. We learn how the original husband who resided in the house thought his wife to be a heretic, so he punished her for such. Society may like to think it's progressed beyond the overly puritan views of the past, but there's still a serious problem today with men attempting to control women. We even see this throughout ""Things Heard & Seen"" as George frequently attempts to gaslight his wife into thinking she only believes in ghosts due to her under-eating.Co-director Robert Pulcini spoke on this idea during an interview with Decider: ""I think it's actually a very topical notion as we're seeing this kind of cultural revolt going on with, ""toxic people"" who have gotten away with things for so long getting their comeuppance. There's something very satisfying about this shift of who's damned actually in this story and who has the power to do that. I think there's a spiritual power, you know, feminine power in this movie that really delivers the ending.""Pulcini's co-director, Shari Springer Berman, carried on with this train of thought, explaining, ""I see the final scene as a metaphor for all the women who have been abused by husbands and fathers and preachers, and teachers and all the business people and producers and all that. Maybe not in this in their lifetime, but in the metaphysical sense of the eternity, of gaining some power.""In light of the #MeToo movement and many powerful men's crimes being exposed, even decades after the fact, it looks as though the scales of justice have gotten a little closer, at least somewhat. There's still a lot of work to be done in terms of gender parity in society, but ""Things Heard & Seen"" suggests that the tides have begun to turn.Mike Bedard - Looper.",Things Heard & Seen

There's no suspense, an electric toothbrush switches on on it own and... someone knocks at the door, it's just clumsy and cliche. No on-screen chemistry between Seyfried and... is that supposed to be a male lead? Conversations are stilted and awkward, not because their marriage is falling apart, but because the script is terrible and the dialogue isn't very well delivered.There's supposed to be some kind of musical element, Seyfried finds some ""spooky"" music score, but again, the audio design of this is Hallmar to the max.Tired, unoriginal and even the actors seem bored.",Things Heard & Seen

As most stories without a solid direction, this film starts off well but 2/3 on it loses steam with the main characters, the emotion and even acting.The film should have worked with a main cast of Norton, Seyfried, Seehorn, and veterans as Karen Allen and F Murray Abraham.

Now I know why. The movie itself isn't horrible, I actually liked a lot of it. But that ending .... I just don't understand. Not sure if that is how the Author of the book intended it to be, but DAMN. Such a let down!No arrest? We didn't even get to see Justine tell the detective ANYTHING. And she's a very interesting character and a huge piece to this puzzle. She comes out of the coma, to get our hopes up we will see a cool story from her, but no. I get we didn't ""need"" that fir the viewers, because we already know what happened. But would have been cool to see.The ghosts? What was this movie! I am genuinely confused to of why we spent so much time getting to learn who the ghosts were, but never actually figured out the purpose. Also, there was another spirit in the house? Are we supposed to assume that spirit was a man who took over George? Just sucks. Her death was never even brought to justice, we only saw maybe 7 minutes of them trying to figure out who killed her. Again, maybe there was never an arrest in the book. But it would have been cool to see what happened to George. Did he die? Is he on an island somewhere?I'd say watch it.

Where's the closure in that? Moreover, where is the justice? George Claire got away with forgery, adultery, murder, attempted murder, and where was he going with the boat, exactly?The inverted cross appears in the sky. This symbol has long been a misnomer in horror movies and it's ridiculously misleading. I'm not sure when it became a Satanic or ungodly symbol but originally it was a symbol of humility or unworthiness in comparison to Christ. Saint Peter asked for himself to be crucified upside down because he did not consider himself to be equal to to the Savior. Look it up, people.My budding filmmaker offspring could have come up with a better ending than this oddity.

The theme is applied to paper thin characters lacking believable motivations. The relationships also ring false... As if the two leads were complete strangers despite supposedly being together many years and sharing a child.The story is dull, slow and uneventful until a rushed ending edited together in nonsensical fashion sure to leave the viewer unsatisfied.I believe this film is the result of Woke politics wherein unqualified, low talent 'creators' are given a budget because of their gender and and gender focus.",Things Heard & Seen
213,b_trought,"Typical Netflix movie, only less coherent",3,15 May 2021,"Ok, so I'm not a fan of Netflix movies. Overall I find they contain ideas in them aren't fully fleshed out and are derivative. The writing lacks punch and originality, the stories are predictable, and the visuals rely heavy on the current fashionable trend of lense flares and colour palettes of turquoise and orange. Add in plenty of (overly corrected) political correctness or woke-ness, an over-sexualisation of teenagers and some unnecessary sexual relationships that add nothing to the plot, men that are abusive, or selfish and act oppressively to all women in the film. These are just some of the ideas that are squeezed in you're usual Netflix movie... If you're not sure about this, or disagree then watch their movies and observe who the villian is, or what ideas they consistently demonise and you'll get the idea.This movie has nearly all of these tropes, though in a less obvious way in some cases (which is good) nonetheless, and like most Netflix movies, the shoehorning of so many themes gets in the way of how clearly the story is told and experienced. And that is the reason for the low score- the movie is muddled in terms of what it is saying. It's not original in any way either, apart from the artwork (which I really enjoyed btw). There is a spiritual aspect to the story, but I suppose this is Netflix's way of replacing Western Christian exposition with something they believe is more suitable!!?? I haven't read the book so don't know.Would I recommend it? Not really as Ive seen much better films of this type. But I wouldn't recommend many Netflix films either! ;-)",Things Heard & Seen

George tells the students at the exhibit to look at the hands in the boat slipping off, just like the ending.

As others have mentioned, there are numerous plot holes or red herrings (depending on your bent) which should have been omitted from the film. Their inclusion doesn't create a Sixth Sense denouement; rather, they just clutter up the plot. There also seems to little understanding of how to adapt a psychological novel into a compelling and succinct film. As such, nothing--not even the main characters--is fully developed.

Something that worked really well I thought James Norton, his story in the movie was the most interesting and fun to watch. The performances of all actors are good.Something didn't work well in the movie's haunted house dynamics.

But then it's kind of expected when you think about it.Full of tropes, yes. Cliche tropes, however a religious undertone finalises the film. Whilst beautiful imagery, it falls a little flat. Was it really justice? Not really. A lot of tragedy had to happen first.I didn't hate it, but I'd probably never watch it again. It is the better Amanda Seyfried haunted house film recently.Tropes:

No one thinks he's capable of evil. A few people start to notice it and he tries to get rid of them.

266,Emily_Baines,Such A Disappointment,5,20 June 2021,"This movie began as something promising. A not-so-bad imagery, script seems a bit different from that indifferent mass of cheap horror movies, dark secrets slowly unravel. And somewhere in the middle of the runtime this movie started to collapse. The mystical elements of this film became over-dramatical (and funny if you get into the sarcastic mood), and one could guess what is going to happen next without any sweat. The last minutes of the movie were not based on intrigue (which would be an appropriate decision when making a horror movie), on philosophical thoughts and insights (I will shortly review this film's 'ideas' soon) or on strong emotional experiences (because the scenery can also be TOO MUCH apocalyptic, especially in 2020s). It was a pure inertia. Such a big let down, right?However, if all of this could get any cheaper, it certainly did. Think again: an absolutely pure and saint wife, her beloved daughter, an honest and mighty 'she-can' type of feminist, a couple of grey he-characters, and then absolutely damned-dark-negative-terrible-horrible husband without any positive personality values. Doesn't it sound like a very childish and plain way to 'win' symphaties of the watchers? This is a wound of modern movies. Putting in non-white, non-hetero actors in movies just because they are the way they are, without thinking about their talent or how it sticks to the script. The same goes there: the script-writers might have thought that a moral about the weak and fragile woman who still cannot win against a brutal an heartless husband can save the lame story, however, the results were not as expected.Shortly said: you may expect too much from the trailer, description or even the beginning of this film, anyway, go watch something else.

I found it deep and interesting and loved the parallels of good and evil and the ending was absolutely perfect. Dante would have been proud!

Is it a: I married a dangerous stranger flick? It was trying to be both because it was weak in both instances. Also, this reminds me of Amytiville. Famous as a faked out paranormal story. People murdering loved ones having a hard time getting off on insanity pleas just trying to pass it off as supernatural influence of somekind: oh I was possessed. Or the devil made me do it... major bs.Also wtf is up with James Norton? He's good playing the imposter husband just like he was good playing the tortured vet turned pastor with the impossible love story (Grantchester).It's like all the hotness was drained from him. Was it the holy man thing? Or the blond highlights? Yet I found myself perfectly indifferent to his repeated nude scenes. When I used to drool at shirtless scenes in Grantchester.

The story is being laid out slowly and takes you on a journey through time, spiritual connections and art. The twists are surprising, but very subtle - I know it sounds weird, but this is part of why the movie is so amazing.

352,katherine-thomas-301-406094,Muddled,5,1 May 2021,"It feels like they didn't really know what they wanted this to be. It's billed as a horror/supernatural thriller but I'm not sure that it's either. Firstly, it isn't scary. The supernatural elements have absolutely no fear attached to them, even towards the beginning before the audience find out what's actually going on. I wouldn't really call it a thriller either. There are some ok elements but mainly it's just a bit blah.The beginning starts off OK. A couple and their young daughter move to to a small town and in to a creepy house. Creepy things start to happen. You start to think ""here we go"", then nothing. The 'creepy' elements don't really go anywhere. We're supposed to assume that the actions of the couple are influenced by the ghosts residing in the house but this isn't really explored properly so it's just an assumption that the audience makes. George, who starts off like your average guy, is suddenly a cheating, abusive, forging, murdering sociopath. Ok, but it seems to come out if nowhere. Character development is terrible. And Catherine has an eating disorder but we don't get any details about this. Again, I think the audience are to assume this is due to the state of her marriage but it isn't explored in any real way so doesn't add anything to the plot.The ending in particular was ridiculous. I've since read about Swedenborg and George Innes whose painting was featured heavily in the film and seemingly who influenced a large portion of the plot (book) but if you don't know anything about this it's very hard to follow the logic. I've not read the source material so cannot comment on how the book handles this but I would assume things are much better explained.Overall it's muddled. Some aspects are ok. Some don't make sense and some are just ridiculous. I don't need every single thing explained to me but there are certain things that it's useful to tell the audience so the plot makes a bit more sense. It's a shame as I've always liked Amanda Seyfried and I think James Norton is brilliant (he does a good job here of being the abusive husband actually. If you want to watch him at his best watch season 1 of Happy Valley). But overall I was disappointed and wouldn't recommend.",Things Heard & Seen

377,ixel_the_ix,I have Absolutely No Positives,1,29 April 2021,"The Short Version:
If they had done this movie in the way the book originally outlined it, where the view point is primarily not Catherine's, this would most likely have turned out better than it did. Instead, they tried to give you a corny, unpolished ghost story and then decided to jump back to content that was actually in the novel and then give you a terrible (and I mean absolutely awful) ending that not only didn't happen in the book, but also doesn't even tie into the movie (if you can call it that) that they made. All things said, if you don't mind mediocre writing, minimal character development, a lack of plot direction, abysmal acting from most of the cast (I fully blame the writers and director for that as many of these actors have proven themselves adept at their craft over many years), and cheap jump scares, this movie is for you.The Long Version:
I came home early this morning to this movie as the headliner on Netflix. I was still working on getting comfy and was just letting it play the preview while I got settled in. It seemed vaguely interesting, but not something I planned on watching as it looked like every other cheap thrills haunted house movie out there.Then I got curious about the novel it was based on, thinking I might be more interested in the book. Turns out, I just finished reading All Things Cease to Appear roughly 3 months ago. It's one of the few novels in the last year that I legitimately had a hard time putting down. I definitely recommend it. I couldn't even tell this movie was based on that book. The book, just to be clear, is NOT a horror novel. It's a story about couples and everything we will do to not say the things that really matter to each other, the lengths we are willing to go to hide who we really are and society's expectations of each of us, even at the greatest of costs. It is definitely a ghost story, but not of the sort the movie makes it out to be.I was curious as to the take on this movie, since the preview didn't seem much like the book. So I pushed play. I attempted to watch it in a 'The Shining' sort of way, as if it was more of a general interpretation rather than a direct translation. I won't say I was successful and I am that person, the one who tells you that the book was so much better than the movie. The novel is so intricate, so delicately entwined with itself that the story the reader is being given feels entirely natural and unforced. The movie, sadly does not even begin to reach those depths. The relationships that are meant to be so intimate, profound, and tragically beautiful feel forced, unnatural, and unappealing. None of the characters feel as deep and knowable as they were written to be and the majority of the film focuses on the ""ghost story"" in the house's history. Which is categorically NOT the point the book was making.There was very little involvement from Cole, the youngest brother, which is odd considering the integral part he played in not only the Clare's lives, but in Frannie's life both during and after the events of her childhood. The relationship between George and Willis is all but non-existent, ending after only 2 encounters with an angry outburst from Willis with no apparent reasoning behind it. (There was a reason, you're just not getting it from this movie). George Clare, by far the largest catalyst in the story, is bland...mundane...uninteresting to the Nth degree until the 1hr30min mark. He doesn't feel ominous in any respect and the movie elects to take all the terrible things he did and smoosh them into a very, very tiny space of time. This probably wouldn't have been necessary if they hadn't tried to push the haunted house angle and actually focused on what the story was actually about.The liberties taken to make this into a crappy ghost story are astounding. The constantly flashing lights revealing the ghost to Frannie, there were no seances, no ghostly warning of impending doom. There is a ghost, of sorts, in the book. But it isn't a ghost in the same terms as what they present you with in this poorly done adaptation. It is meant to be more of a...feeling. The feeling we all get when we're in a place with history and the lives of those who were there before us. The feeling we get when there are too many secrets, secrets we keep even from ourselves.",Things Heard & Seen
378,Glassgrl,Such a frustrating mess,3,1 May 2021,"I really wanted to like this movie - it had a decent cast and the production values looked good- but there were SO many things in this movie that went absolutely nowhere!What was the point of her eating disorder? I was thinking maybe husband was going to use it against her to make her look crazy when she started catching on to his lies. Nope.Why did we bother getting to know the Willis character? If her only function was to illustrate that George was a jerk and expose the affair with the scarf toward the end, that could have easily been done with a nameless throwaway character that didn't confuse the plot.The boys who used to live in the house. Why were they so keen to come back? Surely they will be involved in the climax in some way. Nope.Most importantly, what was the point of the house being haunted???!!!! I assumed that the conversation that Catherine had with Floyd was foreshadowing that the ghost would end up helping her against her husband in the climax. Nope. She just let Catherine die.And then the ending comes from out of nowhere and was completely unsatisfying and pretentious. So no justice for any of the women in that house, as the real estate agent so aptly notes, and as far as anyone knows, George escaped and is living on a beach somewhere.This movie fails as horror, fails as a thriller, and fails as a cohesive drama.

382,andywright-96438,hypnotically poor,4,2 May 2021,"This is a weird movie. I mean, yes it's not very good as my rating suggests, but I was interested up to the bizarre ending - it is by no means a boring movie, yet so much about this movie is so underdeveloped.I'll touch on something no one else has mentioned, perhaps because no one else noticed: this is supposedly set in 1979/1980. But why? It's not relevant in any way, and almost everyone looks like they could be current era hipsters. There are a few products here and there which are of the era, but I'm not sure if post it notes would have been available at that time. Throughout the film it never felt of the era, maybe it was the way it was shot? Also the hair and makeup was noticeably modern as well. This suggests a bit of laziness on the part of the production team.There were some things I liked; the husbands pointless random acts of violence were unintentionally hilarious. The film was clearly going for some kind of shining vibe, but was so far off the mark it came across as a 'scary movie' type parody. The seance scene, again, was hilarious with no tension or gravitas as people waved their hands around spouting off nonsense about 'no ghosts are evil', ehhh except maybe that one... so, you know, be careful? Or something? Who knows.So is this a 'so bad its good' movie? Maybe..? It's stupid enough and earnest enough to be ridiculous. But I'm not sure if it is quite rubbish enough. I can imagine some people would get bored with the plot threads which go nowhere. That being said, it might make for a fun drinking game - every time someone claims to be an artist of some sort, take a drink! Every time a ghost appears and does nothing, take a drink! Every time the wife is holding a glass of wine, take a drink!Should you watch it? I'd recommend it to people who enjoy critiquing movies, as there's a lot to unpick here along with some positives. It's generally got a bit more substance to it than a lot of other low effort horrors, but there's just a few things missing before it can be called 'decent'.",Things Heard & Seen

Anyone who actually paid attention will understand exactly. As the ghost narrates that the gates of Hell are only visible to the evil, George is on his boat, attempting to escape. He knows it's all over for him as Justine has awoken from her coma and informed the police of his murders. Again, the ghostly voice narrating says THE GATES OF HELL ARE ONLY VISIBLE TO THE EVIL. You can clearly see that he is being swept into Hell. It's RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF YOU! There are no loose ends here. The ending did not ""abruptly"" end as others claim. The scene of George on his boat going to Hell was actually breath-taking. This was a really good movie and definitely worth a watch.",Things Heard & Seen

397,mcbare,The ending explained,8,19 May 2021,"It seems a lot of people didn't get the ending. Maybe this will help:
George Claire supposedly wrote his dissertation on George Innes, a famous American landscape artist. Innes was a follower of Swedenborg, who believed (among other things) there is a connection to Heaven and Hell through nature. The movie was sprinkled with gorgeous landscape views, with dramatic lighting and brilliant colors, meant to evoke Inness' paintings.Floyd's first meeting with George includes a reference to Swedenborg, and Floyd holds up his book with an Innes painting depicting a a cross in the sky, meant to be a portal to Heaven. He states he is a follower in Swedenborg's beliefs, believes in the existence of spirits who will help those in the physical world, and sees nature's connection to spiritualism in Inness' paintings.Cathy and Floyd see the female spirits during the seance. They are being held back by a malevolent male spirit.After George murders Floyd, the spirits confront George with his crime using George Inness' painting with the cross during the classroom slideshow. This painting is also a metaphor for Floyd's death in the water; Floyd has gone to Heaven, and has, in fact, become a re-enactment of his favorite Inness painting.The female spirits of the house (seen earlier in the seance) try to help Cathy, but cannot do much in the face of a man's free will (I.e. George's decision to murder Cathy). What they can do to help is wake up Justine.With Justine's threat becoming a reality, George tries to flee on the boat, however the spirits confront him again, using the topic of his supposed dissertation. But the Inness painting has changed - this time the cross is upside down, and a fiery portal is opening up under the waves. George is going to Hell (either literally or figuratively), and has now become the subject of an Inness painting that is the *reverse* of Floyd's painting.The painting depicting George's hellacious fate hangs on a wall. We see through the flash of the woman's ring that it is across from the photo of the Smit family who also became the spirits in the household. The female spirits had successfully avenged Catherine, thus finally taking care of one of their own.",Things Heard & Seen

Even though sometimes the story gets a little predictable, the way it's told is magic to me.I think this movie has so many layers and leaves so many questions unanswered.

403,samanthawarren-45524,The people who didn't like this also didn't like Midsommar,10,7 May 2021,"You cannot go into this movie thinking it's a traditional horror film, because it's not. It's a thriller/drama with a theme of feminism and issues with the way women are treated. George is a typical white male who thinks nothing he does comes with consequences. He gas lights his wife, has an affair (yet gets jealous when she's flirtatious with a young man), and is all around a garbage person. He lies to get ahead, and when caught jumps to murder/hurting others, instead of being a big boy and dealing with his bad choices. The history of marriages in the house they live in seems to be the same as theirs, women mistreated (and eventually) murdered by their selfish husbands. As for the ending? Well I like to think George died in that storm and ended up in hell/purgatory. Yes there are some plot holes, and yes there are some plot points that are simply touched on and never explored deeper. I choose to enjoy the information I was given and draw my own conclusions by filling in the spaces that were left empty. I like that it was not a cut and dry, tied in a bow by the end type of movie. It makes it better when you have to decide for yourself what was real and what wasn't.",Things Heard & Seen
404,fyberduck,An incredibly intelligent movie that expects the same from the audience,8,1 May 2021,"IF you're familiar with Victorian Era concepts about spiritualism and Transcendentalism-plus maybe a little Feminist history-you will greatly appreciate and enjoy this film. It also helps to have some knowledge of American fine art history (specifically the Hudson Valley School). So I get that this movie was almost tailor-made for me.BUT, for those viewers who seem to be struggling with the story, here's some explanations for the ""unexplained"" ""loose ends"" I keep reading about:1. It's an accepted fact among certain communities in the Northeast that some older houses are ""haunted""-my mother swears that two of the houses in which she lived in Maine had ghosts or spirits. One of whom was entirely non-threatening and didn't remotely scare her or her siblings as children. It's not weird that Catherine would actually be comforted by the ghost's presence-family members swear that this one particular ""ghost"" gave off the vibe of a friendly (but doddering) older relative who was constantly forgetting things. The other was in a different house and it terrified the whole family. They didn't stay in that house long.2. Catherine's eating disorder was her way of exercising some control over the situation as it became more dysfunctional. This is a widely recognized motive seen in people with eating disorders. She may not be able to make her husband tell her the truth about ANYTHING, but she can damn well control her weight.3. Catherine's schmuck of a husband was damned and taken to Hell in the end. The fiery waves and inverted cross in the final painting are the exact opposite of the soul ascending to Heaven in the primary painting. Whether you believe that he was about to die and his soul dragged into the fiery pit (literal Hell) OR that the painting was just a metaphor for the fact that he was about to lose everything and be sent to prison (figurative Hell), either way he was damned and couldn't escape justice-divine or human.All in all, I was impressed by the depth of storytelling and the cast's performances. If you enjoy cerebral thrillers with a slight supernatural twist, watch this movie. Everyone else should find something different.",Things Heard & Seen

It is well paced and takes the time to set up the characters backstories. The acting is solid and very believable. The film is based upon a book and perhaps the productions desire to stay true to the book has disappointed shallow viewers who are simply wanting cheap/ nuanced scares. This film is far more poignant and has an important message to tell. Without giving it away I would definitely recommend watching this film. My only criticism would be the ending, which I felt was rushed.

I'm glad I did.An important and clear analysis of toxic masculinity, male entitlement and how gender crimes affect every society throughout history. This is not a movie for entertainment, is a movie made to shock and to showcase the effects and the history of a very real issue. It shows that domestic abuse is not only fisical violence, and that the building up to gender crimes is not just about a fisically abusive husband. It builds up the message that women need each other in a society where we are seen as targets, and where the defiance of male authority and expectations can be threat to our very own existence.

473,thatjennings,A very earnest and strong film that could've been a new masterpiece,7,30 April 2021,"I think the best thing I can say about this movie is that it's earnest. The cast gives great, believable performances all around and there isn't a weak link among them. Norton as George Claire is great as a character you'll love to hate. Seyfried isn't given as much to do as you may like but she sells her scenes very capably. Apart from the actors, the movie is often quite nice to look at as well, with plenty of high shots to soak in the beautiful landscape and set the scene.I'm trying to puzzle the very mediocre reviews the movie received and I can only imagine it's due to the overall lack of scares and somewhat busy plot. If you're expecting a film with 1/3 story, 1/3 action and 1/3 jump scares, you're going to be very disappointed. The scares are few and far between. Similar to The Haunting of Hill House, this movie is equal parts about haunted people as it is about an actual haunting. The character drama is fairly strong, with believable motivations and distress.However, the film's one major flaw that I can agree with others on is the uneven nature of its many plot points. There's a lot going on in the movie's run time. It balances all the plot points in a watchable fashion, but it does throw off the pacing sometimes because you, as the audience, can't quite get a hold on which plots are really gonna pay off and which are just feeding the larger narrative. It's kind of hard to explain, but this probably would've worked better as a limited series than a two hour movie.All in all, Things Heard and Seen is eminently watchable and a far better movie than the 5.3 you're seeing at the time of this review's writing would lead you to believe. Just don't put it on hoping for lots of jump scares or spooky nuns jumping out of closets, it's not that kind of movie.",Things Heard & Seen

The boy that used to live in the house and where his father killed himself and mother.3. Annoying lady that takes the wife's side and is suspicious of the husband from the get-go. She plays no real part.4. Back story of a women ghost that died in the house, apparently there are more than one. Evil first husband's ghost may be possessing the husbands? We are never really told.5. Wife that is miserable from the beginning even before husband does anything wrong or gets ""possessed"".6. Sail boat.7. Some student that acts like she hates the husband professor, then takes her pants of and tells him to ""get in here if we are going to do this"". She is pretty so husband is like why not?8. Some stupid ending. It just comes out from nowhere. The sail boat from #6 comes back in and husband takes it out in a storm.9.

The Good Wife and Mother is protected by a spirit of, you guessed it, a good wife and mother.Naturally, the Good Wife has an eating disorder (and keeps touching her hair with an unwashed hand she just stuck down her throat), while the Bad Guy cheats on her with a nineteen-year-old, lies and kills.Of course, the name of the woman who brings the Bad Guy to justice is Justine (so subtle, I know) and she is a professional weaver (the metaphor!). The script is so hopeless, that in the end, the Bad Guy is literally consumed by hell.As a woman, I am so tired of these pseudo-feminist films and shows telling ""her story"", where men are always evil and women are always victims.

It feels like for the party scene the writers just went 'What do people normally talk about at housewarming parties?' and then just put all that in whether it's appropriate or not. At one point this guy says 'Oh, yeah. I started wearing glasses when I was around 7 (or some other age idc). I really like what you've done with the place' or something like that. None of it makes sense. The story isn't powerful enough to make this movie worth it, either. And don't expect to care about these characters, they're bland as distilled water.

517,lfw-95353,"If you think the movie couldn't be worse than the book, think again",2,5 May 2021,"Wow. I finished the audiobook yesterday then watched the movie, thinking it couldn't possibly be worse than the book. WRONG. My 2-star rating is only because I like some of the actors in this film so I'm being generous.The book contained a whole lot more of the themes touched upon in the film, those being religion, art, and what I'd call philosophy (the stuff about spirits etc). Also, in the book we learn a lot more about the the main characters, George and Kathy Clare, and the side characters and stories are deeper and played out extensively. This is understandable when translating an audiobook of over 14 hours into a movie.What is not understandable is why the folks who decided to make this movie took the route they did. IMO it was wise to reduce the religion/art/philosophy themes but they completely missed the boat by not making more of the individual stories of George and Kathy, George and Willis, Eddie and Cole (who also had a 3rd brother named Wade in the book) and the story of their family and with Kathy and Franny. All this material in the book helped to build up the main plot, plus it gave us a picture of who George and Kathy really were. Also, the book spans over 20 years before concluding, while the movie completely rewrites the plot and characters to arrive at a speedy ending.As mentioned, I didn't like the book much but it had a lot of potential that got lost in all the thematic junk. The movie was just a hodgepodge of the most basic plot points of the book that completely fell short of ever achieving anything meaningful.",Things Heard & Seen
518,DannyWillis,"Easily one of the most pointless, worst movies I've ever seen",1,22 May 2021,"Things Heard & Seen is easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And I actively seek out bad movies! But this one, it's not that it was poorly-made, it just had no point. There was no reason for it to exist. Nothing happened.There's a husband and wife, right? The wife has an eating disorder, but it never affects the plot in any way, nor does it have any impact on her character. It's just there, as a thing that they keep mentioning for no real reason.The husband murdered his cousin and stole his identity, forged a letter of recommendation to get his job, murdered his boss, tried to murder his coworker, then axe-murdered his wife. Does he suffer consequences? Who knows. It ends with him turning into a painting. It's almost impressive, the lengths it goes to so that there's no resolution.Not that there's much to resolve. It's supposedly a ghost story, but the ghosts never actually do anything. Like... at all. There's zero relevance to the plot. But they're all women who were abused and murdered in that house, they just never helped any of the future victims. Because this movie hates women.And the aforementioned husband? Despite being twitchy and unpleasant, and having all the charisma and charm of a wad of wet toilet paper, and being a serial con artist and murderer, he has sex with basically every woman in the movie. They're just all drawn to him because they're supposed to be drawn to him. The women have no real motivation except what the plot demands.Absolutely no characters in the movie develop or change in any way. Nobody learns a lesson. Lots of people are murdered but it only takes a scene or two for everyone to forget about each one. Nothing that happens matters in any way to anyone else in the story.I can't believe I watched all of that. It was like a car accident, I couldn't look away.",Things Heard & Seen

520,kathleen-70588,Disappointing; you'll probably be confused if you didn't read the book.,7,17 May 2021,"Ugh. I rated this 7/10 because I thought for the most part it was well acted and that's about it. Let me say that I usually try to keep books and movies separate, but I think I would've left this movie very confused if I had not read the book. The story was a mess.The pacing was bad. There was limited backstory, when the source material was basically all backstory. People's actions weren't explained and would have left me going ""What was the point of that?"" if I didn't read the book first. It seemed like they, poorly, tried to blame the characters actions on the ghosts of the house, and also turn it into this generational ghost women protecting the current woman of the house thing. If the latter had been done well it would've been fine, but it wasn't. George was a narcissistic slime ball and murderer all along, before he got in that house. This was revealed slowly and really well in the book, but I felt like it was really abrupt in the movie.Honestly everything in the movie felt really abrupt. The source material is told from many character's POVs and spans multiple years and adapting that into a two hour movie would be tough, but I feel like it still could've been done better. Whoever greenlit this as a movie was mistaken, because to give the story a proper showing it needed to be at least a limited series.Long story short, if you were confused after the movie what I wrote above is why. Overall this was well acted, but incredibly disappointing; it had so much potential and fell so short. I hope someone picks up the book for a show one day.",Things Heard & Seen

527,tavlav,A horror movie (but not a ghost story) for specific tastes,9,30 April 2021,"If you go into this film expecting to see a haunted house movie, you'll likely be disappointed.It's probably better as a book, but having only seen this adaptation, I very much enjoyed it. This movie actually reminded me of Crimson Peak insomuch as it's not a ghost story, it's just a story with ghosts in it. The real horror of this movie surrounds a struggling woman who's married to a narcissist, who will do anything to get what he thinks he deserves. I can't really detail that more without giving spoilers, but I will say that there are some classic signs of an abusive relationship throughout the film and the way it ties together with the supernatural elements was very satisfying for me. I also really liked the Swedenborg allusions, and the way they carried throughout the film. Most of what I've seen about unfinished plot points is only partially fair, imo everything that happens ties back in to the central plot of the movie, even if some things don't have clear consequences. And as most of the reviews so far have mentioned, the acting was quite good.I will also say that I am a big fan of spiritualism & somewhat niche religious beliefs, love the scenery of upstate New York, and have some experience with domestic violence, all of which surely contributed to my enjoyment of this film, which is why the title of this review says ""for specific tastes"".

I'm not going to write eight paragraphs trying to convince anyone how good or bad the film is; I'll leave that to the experts. But I will say, if you're wanting a horror film, or a film that satisfies on a visceral level, or a film that ""makes sense"" so you don't have to think too much, by all means, move on to something else, But if you are in the mood for a well-acted, literary, poetic rendering of a classic morality tale seen through the lens of Victorian spiritualism and Swedenborg's mysticism, watch and enjoy.",Things Heard & Seen

I'll be the first to admit that the book contained endless viewpoints from different characters that we didn't necessarily need... but by making the viewpoint solely that of Catherine in the movie it left viewers lacking vital information that would have made the movie cohesive by making sense of some of the characters motives and purpose... but this just felt like I was watching an abridged version of a longer movie (but not showing the important bits).Skip the film and just read the book....

But instead it gives you a fresh take. I really appreciate how the movie built up on many concepts it brought up. And the ending in my opinion really ties the entire movie, with the hell afterlife picture which contrasts with the heaven like afterlife picture we saw throughout the film, and the good always winning in the end which was stated when they conducted a séance only for it to actually show itself in the end.

It helps if you're familiar with the Hudson River painters, although it tries to inject a mish-mash of spirituality that ultimately doesn't gel. If you're looking for a slasher or a spooky ghost story, look elsewhere. The progressive unfolding of Norton's (lack of) character is well-developed, and carries the plot forward, in my opinion.

What this is, is a gothic tale of a narcissist who's lies slowly unravel and a woman who realized she should have trusted her instincts too late.It's the unraveling of a marriage in the worst possible way. It's a story about the lies one tells themselves about their partner to justify their choices or lack their of and the effect that has on the weight of the psyche.The haunting and embodiment of the previous lived lives in the house.. the slow reveal of true character.. it was captivating.There is a line that sets the tone of the film and foretells the fate of the heroine.

Just because the women were damned in life does not mean they will be after.Also the eating disorder has been bought up a lot in the comments, George likely caused Cathys eating disorder - we hear him say to Justine 'That's a lot of lasagne you've eaten' (something along those lines) which cleverly points out he likely done the same to Cathy in the past to control her eating which explains why she eats/drinks whatever he gives her.There's a lot more to this film the deeper you look into it, I think it was very good and was interesting unlike a lot of other films that you don't need to think into.",Things Heard & Seen

The movie takes a spin for the weirder of directions, I'll admit, but I found it original, artistic and even soothing in a way. Worth your time I'd say.",Things Heard & Seen
652,mandyhull-64701,Ask me to write the ending next time!,4,1 May 2021,I was enjoying the slow burn and the acting was brilliant by James and Amanda but the ending made me wish I hadn't bothered.,Things Heard & Seen
653,ivasokovic,Enjoyable,7,17 May 2021,"A lot of the negative comments here stand, but I still found this movie rather enjoyable, and I don't think a lot of the details mentioned in other comments were ""a mess"", it all made sense to me.",Things Heard & Seen
654,ianliddle,Felt absolutely robbed by this movie!!,3,1 May 2021,So much potential but what a disappointment!! The movie actually had myself and my wife fairly engrossed and trying to predict what happens a next. We never would have predicted the ending!! Good grief. Reasonable enough build up but my god did we feel robbed at the end!!! Could have used all that time so much better!! Sorry Netflix. Not good!!,Things Heard & Seen
655,chiantikennedy,Gross George,1,14 June 2021,"I've never written a review before but I came on here just to say I HATED George. Pretentious, sneaky a**hole. I literally couldn't watch the movie because of his character. I've never hated someone in a movie so much - which is why I felt so strongly compelled to write this review.Throw him in the bin.",Things Heard & Seen
656,aduncan-64902,Netflix - the new straight to video section,1,29 April 2021,LameMost of the Netflix original movies would be in the 99c bin if it weren't picked up by NetflixI hate that that is what Netflix has mostly become.,Things Heard & Seen
657,itsvassiliki,Weak plot,6,5 May 2021,"Despite the decent acting, the promising direction and cinematography, it seemed like the writers had no actual plan for the plot. The ending felt rushed in spite of the poetic concept. For some reason, until the 20th minute I thought it took place nowadays.",Things Heard & Seen
658,adrienne-49381,Netflix owes me 2 hours,3,2 May 2021,"I love a good scary movie, but this is not one. The story jumps from cut to cut, characters are never fully developed and the end is complete nonsense. There is a good story in there somewhere, unfortunately it is ""What Lies Beneath""",Things Heard & Seen
659,rachelspawlik,Terrible Ending,1,1 May 2021,"Was a waste of two hours, didn't figure out the waste till the end.",Things Heard & Seen
660,Jadezii,Low Ratings?? Did we watch the same film?,8,1 May 2021,I have absolutely no clue why there are such poor ratings for this film. Watch this movie if you enjoy supernatural thrillers that are mysterious. I was entertained for the full 2 hours!,Things Heard & Seen
661,markryan-82278,Rubbish,3,2 May 2021,"Looked Great, Partner Watched it For James Norton and It Falls Flat.",Things Heard & Seen
662,westdrz,Idiots,3,2 May 2021,"Did the script writers get abducted by some paranormal entity before they could finish it and some lazy assistants write the ending? I was really into it until last 5 minutes, morons! It's so stupid how it ends. And I don't want to hear it's some artist interpretation BS. Geeze, I instantly made up a
better ending in my head so I could feel some sense of satisfaction. What a shame, feel bad for the cast being let down.",Things Heard & Seen
663,stevepvaughan,Well developed story and characters with a big drop off.,7,27 September 2021,"The further the story developed as the movie drew toward it ending the more I was anticipating and expecting of the ending. But it was cruelly anticlimactic. It was (AS IF) one or more key actors were suddenly...unavailable to finish the film, so they just wrapped it up & sent it off. Otherwise, well written, great acting, perfect setting and atmosphere for this mystery/thriller/light horror film.",Things Heard & Seen
