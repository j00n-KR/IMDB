0,SnoopyStyle,teen sex romp,5,13 March 2015,Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is a straight A student council president who looks back at his high school life without really living to the fullest. He gets into Georgetown and is trying to get a scholarship. He and his friends Eli (Chris Marquette) and Klitz (Paul Dano) are outsiders. Then Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) moves in next door and Matthew falls for her hard. Porn obsessed Eli recognizes Danielle from a video. They break up and then he finds her with her old boyfriend porn producer Kelly (Timothy Olyphant).It has some funny moments mostly from Chris Marquette. It's a sharp take on the teen sex romp. Emile Hirsch is way too whiny. It has a bit of Risky Business but it's also uncomfortable adult. It takes a wrong turn going to the porn convention. It overloads on the adult entertainment side and stops being a fun teen sex romp. It would be helpful to develop the other high school characters and less with the adult entertainers.,The Girl Next Door
1,claudio_carvalho,Very Sexy and Funny Comedy,7,19 June 2005,"Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is a non-popular nerd in his high-school, having just two friends, Eli (Chris Marquette) and Klitz (Paul Dano), and concerned with the situation of a Cambojean student and in getting a scholarship to Georgetown. When the sexy Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) comes to live in the next door, they date and fall in love for each other. Later, Matthew finds that Danielle was a porn star, but when her former boyfriend and producer Kelly (Timothy Olyphant) visits her and invites her to return to the porn industry, the situation gets out of hand of Matthews and he gets into serious trouble.""The Girl Next Door"" is a very sexy and funny comedy, and the confusions that Matthew gets into are hilarious. There are many elements of ""Risky Business"" in this movie, and the greatest modification is that Danielle is not a prostitute like Lana (Rebecca de Mornay), and I believe the writer got inspiration in that 1983 comedy to write this story. Elisha Cuthbert is extremely sexy and perfect for the role of Danielle, and Emile Hirsch fits very well for his character. However, Timothy Olyphant ""steals all the scenes"" as Kelly. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Show de Vizinha"" (""Show of Neighbor"")",The Girl Next Door
2,jboothmillard,The Girl Next Door,6,6 September 2005,"This is a pretty obvious story about a boy who falls in love with his next door neighbour, they become boyfriend and girlfriend and she has a dark like secret that may break them apart. Matthew watches quite a few porn films. He falls in love with his new neighbour, the gorgeous Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert). They get on really well, but nearly all the boys are both jealous and recognise who Matthew is with. They know, but Matthew doesn't know, that Danielle is one of the women they admire in their porn videos. A very amusing film with a few moments of nudity, on the TV, but it is mainly the 'girl' that I admire, she's gorgeous. Worth watching!",The Girl Next Door
3,BA_Harrison,The Girl Nexxxt Door.,7,7 November 2009,"If you've seen the 1983 Tom Cruise sex comedy Risky Business, then you'll no doubt get a strong sense of deja-vu whilst watching The Girl Next Door, for the plot is almost identical, albeit slightly tweaked in places and updated for today's audiences: where Tom Cruise's preppy Joel Goodsen fell in love with a hot hooker, Emile Hirsch's Matthew Kidman hooks up with hot porn star Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert); Risky Business's sleazy antagonist, Guido the killer pimp, becomes adult film producer Kelly (Timothy Olyphant); instead of having the contents of his parents house stolen, Matthew loses a $25,000 fund for foreign student Samnang; and rather than running a brothel to recoup his losses, Matthew and his geeky pals decide to use their new contacts in the adult film biz to turn their luck around.However, despite screaming 'rip-off' at every turn, it's very hard not to enjoy this film. Director Luke Greenfield handles his material well and the appealing cast all do a great job: Hirsch is perfect as uptight Matthew who eventually learns to cut loose (to paraphrase Joel Goodsen, 'Sometimes you just gotta say 'What the fk!!'); Elisha Cuthbert is absolutely drop-dead gorgeous and oozes sensuality (although she doesn't get nekkid, which is a real shame!); Olyphant is brilliant as he effortlessly switches between charming rogue and utterly menacing villain; and Chris Marquette impresses as Matthew's film-student pal Eli (is it just me, or is this guy a dead ringer for a young John Cusack?).The Girl Next Door does suffer a little during it's more emotional scenes, which lack conviction, but these less effective moments are easily counterbalanced by the film's genuinely funny moments that capitalise well on the film's lewd premise, including Matthew imagining Danielle getting it on with his parents, a fracas at an adult film convention in Las Vegas, and Matthew's run in with a friend of the family at a lap-dancing club.Although The Girl Next Door is far from original, and never reaches the levels of perfection achieved by Cruise and Co. (let's face it, Risky Business is a classic of the genre and a very hard act to follow), it passes the time well enough, offering some quality eye candy for us blokes, a bit of mushy, sentimental, lovey-dovey pap for the ladies, a decent pop/rock soundtrack, and a heartwarming outcome for all of its characters.",The Girl Next Door
4,michaelRokeefe,Window undressing.,4,20 February 2007,"This is no RISKY BUSINESS, but worth a watch. Matthew Kidman(Emile Hirsch)is an eighteen-year-old sheltered, straight edged, book smart young man about to turn his life upside down and inside out. Everyone's perfect and model student happens to look out his window and view his new next door neighbor. Lord have mercy, hang on to your socks...what an eyeful. The new ""girl next door"", Danielle(Elisha Cuthbert), isn't just a girl after all. She is a one-time porn star and she is now determined to take her new admirer and crack him from his shell and make him the envy of all his friends. What a way to discover life. The strong sexual situations aren't harmful, but do render R rated fun. Is Cuthbert the only reason to watch this flick...well, yes! Others in the cast: Timothy Olyphant, Chris Marquette, Paul Dano, Timothy Bottoms and Donna Bullock.",The Girl Next Door
5,hitchcockthelegend,Listen up minions.,7,28 February 2009,"Matthew Kidman is a straight 'A' student, goodness pours from his every pore, but something is missing in his life. Then one day the unthinkable happens, the sultry and sexy girl next door becomes his girlfriend. But a skeleton in the closet and a voyage of discovery will ensure that their destinies are about to hit a riotous road.The Girl Next Door is bawdy, smutty and, plot wise? As stale as two week old bread, it's also excellently written, charming and as funny as heck! The teen sex comedy is by and large a tired old genre, so how nice to visit this 2004 effort to find that it wears its heart on its sleeve and clearly wants to be a message movie with brains as well as heart. Featuring the ""Adult Movie Industry"" as it does, the piece could so easily have been an excuse for garnering cheap sexy laughs out of flesh for fantasy situations, oh they are there for sure, but for every nerdy wet dream gag, we have it cloaked in intelligence of thought provoking interest.Taking the lead female role, and positively oozing sexuality, is Elisha Cuthbert, wonderfully essaying the working girl who really does just see her profession as a means to an end, with true love seemingly passing her by. On top nerd form we have Emile Hirsch {Matthew}, Paul Dano and Chris Marquette, with Timmothy Olyphant doing a smashing weasel turn as a troublesome producer and ex boyfriend of Cuthbert. Bonus comes in cameo form from the ever watchable James Remar, for the ladies his thong wearing skit is of interest surely, for us blokes his sequences are comedic joy only! It's interesting looking at the respective careers of those involved, Cuthbert was the draw card here, yet she has gone on to become something of a C movie star, starring in such poor fare as Captivity. Whilst Hirsch has since wowed audiences in films like Into The Wild and Milk, while Dano of course featured heavily in the hugely successful There Will Be Blood. Sometimes it's obvious that beauty can only get you so far.I personally really enjoyed this film for a number of reasons, so give it a try and you might just feel the same. 7/10",The Girl Next Door
6,Boba_Fett1138,Great teenage comedy.,8,21 September 2005,"This is a sweet romantic teenage comedy that is better than you might expect it to be. It has an intelligent story with some great characters and a believable well constructed love-story. High-school and ex high-school students should be able to recognize a lot in the movie its story and characters.The movie delivers on several levels. As a comedy this movie is fun and certainly entertaining, mainly thanks to the well casted actors. Especially Timothy Olyphant is truly great and enjoyable in his 'villainish' porn producer role. Also as a romantic movie, this movie is a really successful one. The love-story is good and mainly, also very original. Basically this movie is a pleasure to watch, from start to finish.The story has some great turns in twists in it and you never know what is going to happen next. It tries to avoid as many teenage movie cliché's as possible but still unfortunately falls in some traps at times. Still the movie is way better than most other teenage comedies currently being made and some that were made in the '80's, which was the golden age of teenage comedies. This is due to the well written story and characters and the actors that portray them. The movie is fun and at times also hilarious. It's a very entertaining movie to watch for all ages but mainly for teenagers of course who should be able to recognize some of the elements in this movie. The movie also has some great use of some great music.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Girl Next Door
7,neil-476,Hypocritical but enjoyable,6,16 April 2011,"This movie is a romantic comedy about a porn star falling for a lad in high school. Ignoring the fact that this is usually regarded as borderline paedophilia, and ignoring the massive improbability of the central premise, this film tries to have it sweet cake and eat it despite its unsavouriness.There is a hypocritical double standard at work here. The porn element, central to the plot, isn't actually present in the film at all ie. the film doesn't have the courage of the conviction which forms part of its foundation. And if the film doesn't believe in it enough to include sufficient of it to persuade the audience, why should the audience accept its credibility as part of its central conceit? Do be specific, Elisha Cuthbert is always attractive, always cute, always sexy, but never convinces as someone who has been a participant in the porn industry: she is entirely too wholesome.And this is a shame, because it undermines a movie which features characters whose company is quite pleasing, and a script with some good moments in it.",The Girl Next Door
8,movieman_kev,"From the Writers of ""Van Wilder"" & the Director of ""the Animal"" comes a movie that surprisingly didn't suck TOTAL ass",5,17 October 2005,"Matthew (Emile Hirsch) is a nerdy nobody who can't think of anything he'll fondly remember from high school after he graduates. That is until former porn star, Danielle (""24""'s Elisha Cuthbert) shows up as the new girl next door.Things get complicated (as these films are prone to do) when her former porn manager comes calling to get her back. This adolescent male fantasy suffers from way too much music on the soundtrack (nearly every scene of the film is scored with a late '80's or early '90's tune with the purpose to substitute for any true emotional feeling), a insincere undeserved sentimentality that permeates through the film, and a surprising lack of laughs. While the acting is fair enough and the film is watchable, it still lacks any memorability and will be forgotten after a while. Still, it remains a step up for the Director and writers, if a step down for much of the cast.My Grade: C-",The Girl Next Door
9,The_Void,Pornography - still the saviour of high school kids,6,22 September 2005,"Being a big horror fan, I spend a lot of my time watching what you might call 'wayward cinema' but, believe it or not, even the very worst of those films pale in comparison to this little teen flick when it comes to misplaced morality. Here, we have a film that not only shows high school kids in the middle of the porn industry, popping ecstasy pills, stealing things and just generally sticking two fingers up where the law is concerned; but it shows them doing this in a positive light, with a great big smile on it's face! However, I'm not one to complain about such things and, again; believe it or not - this is actually a damn good film! The skewed morality can be off-putting, but it's fairly obvious that this film is meant to be more of a spoof than a serious coming of age tale; so it's better to simply go with it rather than worry too much. The film is in the vein of American Pie, and it follows a young man who is lucky enough to have a porn star move in next door to him. After being caught spying on her undressing, she takes him for a ride and, as you might expect, the two hit it off instantly. However, being a porn star has it's drawbacks, and hers comes in the form of a nasty manager by the name of Kelly.The plot of The Girl Next Door is entirely predictable, but there's always enough side stories and gags to ensure that the action always remains interesting. The film is never side-splittingly hilarious, but some of the sight gags are genuinely funny. Jokes involving a lap dance, and another that sees two high school kids pretending to be porn directors are the best among them. The soundtrack features a lot of good songs, but it can be annoying when they're being played over nearly every scene. One thing that worried me before seeing this film was Elisha Cuthbert. Like most people, I've been used to seeing her in the best American TV show of all time, 24, and didn't think that she'd be able to pull off the role of pornstar. She's a good-looking actress; but I wouldn't consider her to be 'sexy'. However, surprisingly enough she does really well in the role. Her co-star, Emile Hirsch, looks about ten; but he does a good job of getting the audience on his side, so even though it's impossible to believe that a sexy pornstar would go for him; he doesn't ruin the movie. On the whole, while this isn't anything like a great movie; it's a more than solid entry in the teen comedy sub-genre, and if you want a movie that will entertain for a couple of hours with caring about political correctness - this one should do it.",The Girl Next Door
10,mm-39,sick,3,21 September 2004,"Spoilers! My wife did not appreciate this movie at all. This has got to be right up there with Boogie Nights. All they needed was Dino Velvet from 8 mm to produce. The beginning was the dorky guy's next door fantasy. The blond would not give him the time of day in real life. Then the movie turns into sick humor, ie. the lap dance with the neighbor. Then it just tries to get shocking with making a porn movie in the school. I thought that it could of been a romantic comedy, but it was more of a shock movie. The only part that was good was the porn producer. His role was believable. 3/10 My wife thought it was a total brain dead movie.",The Girl Next Door
11,whpratt1,Lots of Fun Film,7,30 December 2006,"This was a great entertaining film with plenty of action and lots of laughs. Emile Hirsch, ""Lords of Dogtown"", plays the role of a very bright high school student and even President of his class, however, he was still not popular with most of the guys and gals of his senior class. Elisha Cuthbert, ""House of Wax"", moves next door to Emile and gives him a free show of her body from her bedroom window and then proceeds to visit his home and asks for help getting to know the town and its hot spots. Elish did not tell Emile that she was a former porno star and poor Emile was still a virgin and very shy trying to put the make on sexy Elisha. Elisha Cuthbert has really grown up since her performance in ""24"" TV Series and is a beautiful young up and coming gal.",The Girl Next Door
12,siderite,Adolescent fantasy coming true. Nicer than what I expected.,7,13 August 2005,"Have a look at this funny teenager movie. It's about a geekish boy meeting a porn star, having her fall in love with him, then ending up together. The plot was unusually thick for this kind of movies and not too cliché.Timothy Oliphant (who I think shows a lot of promise as an actor) stars in this one in a secondary role. Beautiful Elisha Cuthbert is playing the porn star. James Remar also has a part.I have to say that overall the movie was too fantastic to be believable, but then again, it is about adolescent fantasies and ""power to the geek"" things, so it wasn't supposed to feel real. I do hate when they put good lookers in the role of losers and they tag them as losers with weird glasses, thick shirts or pull-overs. I mean, all you have to do to be popular is loose the glasses, clothes and half a brain. Yeah, right! No wonder so many American teens are screwed up.Conclusion: cute love story, nice movie for its category, must see with girlfriend.",The Girl Next Door
13,JamesHitchcock,"Not So Much ""Risky Business"" as ""Nasty Business""",3,14 January 2015,"Such is the shortage of original material in Hollywood these days that any decent film is likely to be remade, either as an official remake or as a disguised one which plagiarises the plot of its original without acknowledgement. Indeed, even films which were not very good in the first place can be candidates for this treatment. I can't for the life of me imagine why anyone might want to remake the early Tom Cruise vehicle ""Risky Business"", but ""The Girl Next Door"", although not officially a remake, is nevertheless a blatant rip-off of that dull eighties comedy. Both films deal with an academically promising high school senior who has just been accepted by a prestigious university. (Georgetown here, Princeton in the earlier film). In both cases the boy needs to raise sufficient money to fund his studies. And in both cases he falls in love with a girl slightly older than himself. Now Hollywood is generally uncomfortable with younger man/older woman romances, but even Hollywood scriptwriters have to admit that ""boy, 18, loves girl, 20"" is not such an unusual or anomalous situation as to qualify as the apparently insuperable obstacle which forms a major plot element in most romantic comedies. There has to be something extra to make the young lady unacceptable to bourgeois society.So in ""Risky Business"" the girl in question becomes a hooker, and here she is a porn star. At first young Matthew, the hero of the film, does not realise what his new girlfriend Danielle does for a living, but when he does he is horrified. Not so horrified, however, that he wants to end the relationship. His troubles start when Danielle, having discovered true love for the first time in her life, decides she wants to give up her career. Her agent and backers in the porn industry, however, see Matthew as a threat to their meal-ticket, meaning that he now finds himself in trouble with them, just as Joel, the hero of ""Risky Business"", found himself in trouble with his girlfriend's pimp.Trying to remake a good film is a project fraught with difficulty, and trying to remake a bad one, officially or unofficially, is even more problematic. ""The Girl Next Door"" is no improvement on its less than distinguished predecessor. Indeed, in some respects it is even worse. Emile Hirsch, admittedly, makes a more sympathetic hero than did the irritatingly cocksure Tom Cruise as Joel; the cocky, irritating one here is Timothy Olyphant as Danielle's agent and ex-boyfriend Kelly, the equivalent of ""Guido the Killer Pimp"". The pretty but oddly-named Elisha Cuthbert is no substitute for Rebecca de Mornay, one of the few good things about ""Risky Business"". If Ms Cuthbert's parents had been paying more attention in Bible class, incidentally, they might have realised that ""Elisha"" was the name of a male Old Testament prophet. Having a forename which does not match one's gender, however, seems to be no drawback in the cinema. Just ask Cameron Diaz, Reese Witherspoon or Daryl Hannah. Or, for that matter, Mandy Patinkin.The film was marketed as a teen comedy, but contains so much adult material that it is really only suitable for over-18s. I nearly said ""contains so much adult humour"", but that's just the problem. It doesn't actually contain much humour at all, adult or otherwise. As with a lot of modern so-called comedies, the script was written on the very dubious basis that tastelessness and breaking a few taboos- besides sex there are a few drug references- are an adequate substitute for wit. The final twist in the plot, involving an amateur porno video unexpectedly becoming a hit as a sex education film shown in schools across America, is ludicrous beyond even the normal standards of teen comedies. Not so much ""Risky Business"" as ""Nasty Business"". 3/10",The Girl Next Door
14,StevePulaski,Your inconsistency is showing,7,28 July 2011,"I had to contemplate long and hard what grade I would give this movie. It was teetering on the edge of recommendation, when ultimately, a few little things docked it down to a state where I can't really recommend it. With that being said, I will say that The Girl Next Door did however keep me entertained for all one hundred and ten minutes because of its very vibrant casting and quite a few jokes that were actually funny that weren't seen in the trailer.Speaking of the trailer, it is another film that pretty much covers up parts of the plot to draw more of an audience. The same thing happened in the trailer for Dream a Little Dream where the big part about the body swapping element was left without a mention. In the trailer for this film, it tries to make this look like a teen comedy following in the footsteps of the American Pie franchise. When really, it is more of an adult raunchy comedy.The plot: Matthew (Hirsch) is a high school Senoir stressing over his big speech he is set to give on the topic ""moral fiber,"" which may get him a scholarship to the prestigious Georgetown University. Looking back on his High School experience when asked what he'll remember, Matthew tries hard to recollect what he will remember but can't find anything.Matthew is in luck because he gets a new neighbor. Her name is Danielle (Cuthbert) and she is probably every guy's masturbatory fantasy come true. Matthew is in his room and notices her changing clothes and can't help but stare. Seeing him, Danielle comes over to introduce herself of all things instead of tell Matt's parents he was snooping.They hang out frequently, developing an awkward yet likable friendship until Matt's friend Eli (Marquette) informs him that she was a porn star under the stage name ""Athena."" Matt is shocked, and in disbelief, and soon enough, he meets the cut throat producer of Danielle's named Kelly (Olyphant) who means business. Kelly and Matt form a very unsettling relationship, and his life begins to spiral out of control between the love of his life and the consequences.The story does have a good motto and moral that is probably one of my favorites next to the meaningful bit in Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. In that film, a guy in prison tells Harold that ""there is no sense getting all riled up every time a bunch of idiots give you a hard time, (because) the universe tends to unfold as it should."" In this, Kelly firmly tells Matthew to ask himself ""is the juice worth the squeeze?"" meaning is Danielle worth the possible consequences. Because of what Matthew tells Danielle in the movie at an adult convention, she declines Kelly's offer and goes back home.While bringing good actors and a good motto into the light, the film also has a number of inconsistencies that I found. One of them is age seems to mean nothing in this film. There's one scene where Kelly and Danielle take Matt to a strip club. Keep in mind, Matthew is in high school and is no older than eighteen or nineteen. How did he manage to get into the strip club? Same thing with the adult convention. How did the three friends get into the convention when they're only Senoirs in high school? Also, why is Danielle going to an adult convention as ""Athena"" when she is a ""former"" porn star? Wouldn't that mean she quit doing it, and usually when you quit something, you don't make public appearances as the job you quit. In order for this movie to exist, many things also can't. Like age and occupation rules.Those things really drag the film down, along with the fact the film does nothing but glorify the world of porn. Not one women in this film, except for Matt's mom (Bullock), is not put in this film to show of their body. I find it a little odd that we see such a world of porn stars and personality lacking women in a film that tries to have a strong motto. While the film packs on a good motto, it doesn't do much to eliminate stereotypes.But for some reason, this film still stood out to me for the music, the performances, and the overall feel. Obviously, the poster child for this type of genre is Risky Business. If I would've seen the full movie, I probably would've found this less in quality. But standing on its own, it really does get laughs despite a few inexcusable inconsistencies. It's a respectable, yet not strong enough Hollywood debut by actor Emile Hirsch, who I still believe will go on and do some brilliant things in his lifetime.Starring: Emile Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert, Timothy Olyphant, Paul Dano, Chris Marquette, Timothy Bottoms, and Donna Bullock. Directed by: Luke Greenfield.",The Girl Next Door
15,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Just take ""American Pie"" and a couple good jokes and you've got ""The Girl Next Door""",3,11 October 2004,"I was expecting too much. This looked hilerious in the trailer. I was excited to rent it. But I was a little disappointed. Even though I was kind of happy there were no in your face potty humor, it still didn't get me. I laughed a couple times. This has just been done a million times. I understand there are homages. And I'm sure the director wanted to honor some teen sex comedies. But I've seen to many of them to get into this. Over all, it's not a bad movie. To be honest, I'd rather watch this than ""American Pie"". ""American Pie"" was very gross. This has it's moments. So, I would recommend to anyone above the age of 18. Otherwise, it's just a porn movie with some kind of a story.3/10",The Girl Next Door
16,=G=,A movie only a teenager could love,5,25 August 2004,"""The Girl Next Door"" is one long series of excuses for serving up huge helpings of sex in an apparent attempt to separate the tween/teen male from the price of admission. This very unromantic lol free comedy tells of an about-to-grad HS student body prez who falls for the house sitting babe next door and then learns she's a porn star and sets about to save her from herself so she can be the person she really wants to be. (Ahem) Hirsch makes a suitable centerpiece while Cuthbert provides the babe-a-licious eye candy as this lame comedy only a teen could love kerchunks though huge gulps of sex obsessed filler. Scoffed at by the critics with poor marks from mature adults, this flick is fodder for teens chock full of shameful subliminals, T&A, and sex talk. A guaranteed winner for teen males and their bimbos and a loser for all others. (C)",The Girl Next Door
17,blanbrn,"A hormone driven movie that's better and different, and it's carried by the cute and sexy Elisha Cuthbert.",7,13 May 2007,"""The Girl Next Door"" is well done and has all the elements of your typical hormone teen flick, yet it's a little different than most, by having characters discover their true feelings and finding love in the most unexpected way. Emile Hirsch stars as Matthew Kidman a high school senior who's a brain and uptight never having any fun, until one day when he discovers his new next door neighbor(Elisha Cuthbert) who just happens to be hot so he tries to give her a try! The opening scene when Matthew sees her thru the open window next door is just great, oh that backside of Elisha! Well upon meeting and finding her name as Danielle they begin to talk, hang out and become friends, only Matthew soon discovers that Danielle is an ex porn star now his world and culture starts to spin out of control! True this film is your typical hormone driven sex flick with plenty of teen pranks, and many sexy scenes and quotes, yet the development of a loving and caring relationship forms between the two central characters. Many of the movies things are crazy but yet they help bring both Matthew and Danielle to love like the Las Vegas porn convention and the prom night sex education video! I must say the performance of Elisha Cuthbert is fabulous she's so cute and sexy and many scenes of her in this film were so hot! Especially the window and pool scenes, and the hotel clothing take off when she sported that sexy red bra and panties! Elisha really carried this film she's really a beautiful and sexy star. Finally ""The Girl Next Door"" shows and teaches a viewer that love can be found for anyone no matter how different the backgrounds and that success and happiness can be obtained in the craziest ways.",The Girl Next Door
18,MovieAddict2016,Are we back in the '80s?,8,21 July 2004,"""The Girl Next Door"" is one of 2004's most entertaining movies -- sweet, crude; funny, sad; moralistic, filthy. Uneven mixtures of opposites attract, much like the leading stars of the film, for a movie that delights the audience at every turn. It manages to satirize the teen comedy genre whilst exploiting it. This is raunchier than ""American Pie"" and yet also far more sophisticated.Emile Hirsche plays Matthew Kidman, a 19-year-old high school senior who hasn't lived life to the fullest during his pre-graduation phase. While fellow schoolmates skip school to go party at the beach, Matthew sits in class, gazing outside at the partying teens, wishing he could be like them.Then the girl next door moves in: Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert), a drop-dead-gorgeous blonde beauty who undresses across the street from Matthew as he watches in his bedroom. She spots him peeking at her, then plays cruel revenge tricks on him, and then eventually falls in love with him because ""of the way he looked at her.""She is touched by Matthew's honesty because she is a former porn star (at the age of 19) and is not used to receiving true affection. When Matthew finds out about her background he is mad, then happy, jumping at the opportunity to sleep with Danielle. Danielle feels betrayed and rushes off to Las Vegas for an adult film star convention. Matthew follows her and tries to ""get her back"" as so many heroes always do, but falls out with Danielle's producer, Kelly (played perfectly by Timothy Olyphant).The movie eventually tackles a number of subplots -- Matthew learning to ""go with it"" and loosen up; Danielle abandoning her past and looking forward to the future; a Cambodian genius being transferred to Matthew's school; Kelly and Matthew's falling out; Matthew's college scholarship, etc. The film juggles all these different ideas, managing to maintain the audience's interest.Yes, it is a bit raunchy at times and the subject matter is probably inappropriately handled in some scenes. However, the core message of the film is beautiful. It's hidden underneath an unfortunate layer of smut that nevertheless fails to harm the film in any way.Obviously inspired by the teen films of the 1980s, such as ""Risky Business"" and the plethora of John Hughes-produced/directed flicks, ""The Girl Next Door"" even boasts a great soundtrack that complements the nature of the film. The acting is one of the movie's most surprising elements -- Hirsche and Cuthbert share chemistry, despite the fact that their two-year age different in real life is quite obvious (Cuthbert looks much older). That's sorta the point, though. Cuthbert is absolutely beautiful, but people wandering into the theater hoping to see her nude should look elsewhere. ""The Girl Next Door"" is better than that -- an honest and touching teen comedy that cares for its characters and studies them carefully.

19,disdressed12,disappointing,5,30 December 2008,"boy,what a let down this movie was.i viewed the unrated version,which promised more sex,more skin,more laughs.from what i saw,there was very little skin here,not much sex,either,and zero laughs.Elisha Cuthbert is nice,but she can't make up for how disappointing this movie was.you can tell the movie had some intelligent thought behind it,and wasn't just going for bottom of the barrel comedy.unfortunately,something got lost in the translation for me,as the jokes weren't funny.in fact,i found the movie bland.though this version was unrated,the original version was rated R by the MPAA.in Canada,it was 18A,except for Ontario,which was 14A.i happen to agree withe 14A rating.for me,that's what it should have been rated,including the unrated version.my best advice,if you're a parent,is to pre screen the movie,and decide if you children are mature enough for it.for me,The Girl Next Door is a 5/10",The Girl Next Door
20,FeastMode,my notes,6,26 July 2019,"Pretty funny and pretty awesome, especially olyphant. also has some heavy cheese and rom-com-y-ness. and there were some very questionable parts and dumb things that happened story-wise. but for the most part the story was cool. it had likable characters. and was generally entertaining (about 3 viewings)",The Girl Next Door
21,dromasca,not even a little bit funny,4,10 September 2004,"In one of the scenes that pretends to be funny in this film the main male character is punished to run naked after the car drove by the main female character. 'It's not funny' he complains. 'It's a little bit funny' she answers. Talking about the film, he is the one to be right!'The Girl Next Door' is an unpleasant mix of teenage comedy, moralizing story and social comment about the porn industry. It takes a good director to mix these themes in a good film, and this movie did not get one. The script bares much guilt as it is never comic enough, sharp enough, crazy enough or credible enough to have the viewer path the threshold of 'so what'?'. Acting does not help either. We never get to care about the characters, they do not succeed to make us love or hate them. I liked Elisha Cuthberg in '24' - one of the best series of the latest years in American TV - but she does not hold the capabilities or she did not enjoy the hand of a good director to turn the role into something to remember. All male teen actors are directed in a way that makes them look unfit for life and screen. The better acted parts are the two supporting roles of the porn moguls, but this is not enough.'Euro-Trip' proved this year that there is a chance for the teenage comedy genre. With 'Girl Next Door' we are back to the moralistic view of the world. Trying to sell the 'human side' of the pornography world in a teenage comedy with 'moral fiber' (another quote from the film) takes much more talent. This film lacks it. 4 out of 10 on my personal scale.",The Girl Next Door
22,MLDinTN,false advertising,5,5 April 2005,"From the commericals I remember on TV, this movie was made out to be another American Pie type of film. But, there is little comedy in it; it is more of a drama. A very hot porn star moves next door for two weeks next to your typical high school senior nerd. He falls for the girl and doesn't learn she's a porn star till his friends show him a tape. She falls for him and realizes she isn't really a slut. Then we have some curves thrown in the plot. Kelly, who Danielle works for, shows up and wants her to make more films. She gets mad at Matt so leaves with Kelly and Matt must convince her to come back. Then other twists include Kelly stealing some money and Matt must come up with a scheme to replace it. Let's just say it involves an almost porn shoot at the senior prom.It sounds like it would be really funny from a simple plot summary, but the laughs are far between. But there are a few, like when Matt gets a lap dance with his father's friend and Matt on ecstasy.FINAL VERDICT: I thought it would be better than it was. I only recommend it if you are wanting to watch an R rated teen flick.",The Girl Next Door
23,g-bodyl,Expecting Much Less!,9,13 May 2010,"I was not expecting much out of this film. This film is a cross between American Pie and Risky Business even though this movie is nothing like American Pie. This is really not that kind of comedy even though there are some funny moments. I would classify this as a drama and a memorable one too.This is about some high school senior falling for his new neighbor, a former porn star. But he doesn't realize at first that she's a porn star. Things goes bad as he comes to his wits.The acting is pretty good. I liked Emile Hirsch and I especially liked Elisha Cuthbert. She looked really good and she acted well. Timothy Olyphant did a great job as Elisha's former boss.Overall, this a pretty good movie. But, I liked American Pie better. There are some touching scenes in this movie. I rate this film 9/10.",The Girl Next Door
24,The-Sarkologist,A Brighter and Happier Version of Risky Business,5,26 August 2021,"Well, here I go again, getting dragged down into the rabbit hole that happens to be NetFlix's recommendation algorithm. As soon as I noticed that the plot of the film was about a High School graduate dating the girl next door who happened to be a porn star, my interest was piqued, and I decided to watch it. Sure, I might claim that I am immune to these recommendation algorithms, but unfortunately Netflix certainly does a pretty good job of suckering me in.So, as I mentioned, this film is about this High School student who happens to also be school president, and has been accepted into Georgetown University. Also, he happens to hang around the school geek squad, though a part of him simply wants to break free for a bit and to actually live life. This is when the girl who is house sitting next door introduces herself, and he suddenly find himself being dragged into the shady world of adult entertainment.It was suggested that this film borrows heavily from Risky Business, and they certainly aren't wrong at all in that regards, except that Risky Business has a much darker feel to it, and is a much, much better film (despite the fact that I'm not particularly keen on Tom Cruise). I guess Risky Business explores the nature of Teenage Angst so much better than this one does, namely in the way that it is put together. This one feels so much brighter and happier, even though there are parts where you squirm because you suspect that nothing good is going to come out of it (though they always succeed in the end).I'm still a bit confused about the whole scene in the bank though, where he comes to withdrawal the money to bring a Cambodian Student over to the United States to study only to find that the pimp - I mean producer - has got there before him. The reality is that it was not his fault that the bank teller was conned, and that the person to blame would have been her - why she was going to the manager to inform him that she had stuffed up is beyond me - her job would certainly be on the line. However, the more I think about it, the more I realise that she is bullying and threatening him to protect her own butt, and that being an inexperienced teenager means that she would certainly be getting away with it. Personally, I would call her bluff, but then again I'm much older, and a lot more experienced, than he is.Mind you, this film certainly did have some interesting twists and turns, especially the video that they made at the end, though I don't want to say any more about it because, well, that is a huge spoiler. In fact, one of the great things about this film is that they dropped some hints that there was going to be something special at the end, and they threw a curve ball making you think that it was one thing, but it turned out to be another. Sure, it certainly is not on the level of Risky Business, but in a way it was still good, especially since there were some pretty gut wrenching parts where I would certainly be squirming, thinking that things were about to go really pear shaped.The other thing is that I feel that this film would be a little dated, especially in the age of internet porn. Yeah, when this was made, porn actresses were considered to be the best of the best, and to be dating one would raise a teenager to the heights of manliness. These days pretty much anybody can become a porn actor, so the charm just doesn't seem to be there. Then again, I am much older and wiser so I'm probably looking at things a little different once again.However, as I said, it's just another one of those films that explores the nature of teenage angst, particularly with regards to the smart kid who may not be mega popular, but still wants to at least have some fun, and that sometimes throwing caution to the wind is actually something that can be quite beneficial.",The Girl Next Door
25,Floated2,Pretty good teen movie,7,11 September 2010,"The Girl Next Door is a pretty entertaining movie. It has many scenes that are hard not to watch and that make you interested in the unravelling of the film. Though it also got plenty of flaws - almost every single scene of the second half of the film seems to act as the climax, and then the movie keeps going - but it's also got one of the most appealing casts I've seen in a while. Emile Hirsh is the central character Matthew Kidman, about to graduate from high school. The girl next door is Elisha Cuthbert is the title character, Danielle. Her character acts very differently from the beginning to the end of the film. She changes quite drastically in personality and its quite good yet odd in a way. Also it was quite strange how at first from meeting Matthew the way she acts with him. It seemed like she was just using him, but as we see throughout the film she does end up liking him. Matthew's two friends and one of Danielle's associates played by Tim Olyphant are particular standouts in terms of comic relief; the movie is genuinely funny though also contains a few dramatic scenes (many involving Matthew & Kelly, and Matthew & Danielle- a strip club scene). Also I found many of the characters to be quite annoying, specifically Matthew's two friends- Eli and Klitz, and Kelly (he was very crude and weird). I feel the writers made his character too over-the-top. There are also some weird and quite odd scenes (Matthew's speech, limo scene) but overall the film is pretty entertaining as a whole.",The Girl Next Door
26,johnnyboyz,"The film is a handsome surprise, albeit with comedy which doesn't always work and stances not hammered home; regardless, it is a hearty and substantial enough piece.",6,30 July 2011,"The Girl Next Door actually makes for a really involving and respectable enough piece, at least it does so right up to the point the lead nabs a peck with that of the titular girl next door. The whole thing might have made for a really smart short; Luke Greenfield striking us as a director able to slot together a telling piece and as a person able to establish; engage; progress and then conclude, with the film loosing rather a bit of energy once everything tanks to that the deserts of Nevada for a lot of running around and the forcing of the lead to having to infiltrate a mansion. Ultimately, the premise of a porn star moving in next door as a kid and his sexist, overly hormonal friends burgeon from school to university rings false; that is to say, the film is in no way the turgid, unholy mess that is worryingly promised when we observe it is about such a thing. Rather, the film takes its idea and decides to put its surprisingly likable young lead through a wringer of anti-social interactions; altercations with dangerous people and through a series of threatening situations which might spiral out of control after having been dragged to places those within feel they are adept to, but in actual fact are punching well above their weights.The young lead is that of Matthew Kidman (Hirsch), an individual on the cusp of shifting from one level of the American educational system to the next, that of high-school and on into a somewhat prestigious university to study politics. Kidman is stuck in a proverbial middle-ground of no man's land within the realms of his school's social hierarchy; he is nowhere near that of a hardened jock, as is exemplary in the masses of cock-sure young men and their large automobiles-plus-successes-with-women whom surround his educational zone; but he is additionally, and on account of two frizzy-haired friends of his, several steps up from being labelled of the ""geek"" variety - Matt just existing on a plateau populated by himself as this middling kid, with few distinguishing features nor behavioural patterns. The finale of high school is nearing, and yearbooks are in the process of being filled; our Kidman struggling in that he cannot get words onto paper nor photographs of into albums when challenged with the idea of recording the events and the people that helped form him in his time there. The kid is on the verge of graduation without having faced the ignominy of marginalisation at the hands of the institute's proverbial bullies, nor indeed has he intermingled at the opposite end of the spectrum by garnering success at having captained the school's champion Football team to glory.The film covers somewhat of an important chapter in Matthew's life as he dares to branch away; dares to push the boat out and get heavily involved in something seemingly way over his head, a general happening brought about by that aforementioned pornography actress. Elisha Cuthbert plays that actress, a woman named Danielle; a woman of slender figure, slinky movement, pouting lips and bright blonde hair, whose moving into the house next door to that of Matt's parents takes very little time for him to notice as such. From these beginnings, an energetic tale is spun out of a young adult with a blossoming persona which could tilt either way, and it is Danielle who goes on to further him down the route of formulating memories; something to write about and pictures of whatever that is required for that part of the yearbook - the joy being in how it sways him towards a mindset more inclined to be nastier and more sordid, before pulling it back and keeping it grounded whilst not falsifying its politics to any alarming extent.Eventually, that of Timothy Olyphant's pornographer Kelly Simon enters proceedings; the film constructing somewhat of an initially positive and reassuring image of the man before slowly peeling away at the surface and beginning to paint a scummy, abject incarnation of the individual. His arc in this sense runs in tandem with that of his field's representation, which is sort of shown up, as a vacuous; aggressive minefield of maliciousness once everyone has been dragged out to Las Vegas for a Doug Liman's ""Go"" inspired romp so as to escape a proverbial wrath, although appears to recall that the film's target audience may very well be all-too fond of such things and thus, disappointingly restrains said politic from being too damning. Principally, the film is a coming of age; American high-school orientated sex comedy following someone nervous about the sex and with an attitude to the comedy which is strictly grounded and politically straight-and-narrow. The film's presence of a female, specifically that of someone whom specialises in being a star of pornography, is not the flimsy, loose-cannoned and misjudged procession of smut and trash that it might have been; rather, it is about a woman coming into the life of a young man, but being able to have the power to shape and inspire rather than roll over and play dead as an object of one's fantasies. The Girl Next Door is a middling, oft confused piece, but with content to get involved in and characters to get behind: a welcome change for the usual fare of this ilk.",The Girl Next Door

The sex jokes are crude, the situations totally deserve the R-rating, and of course, there's more gratuitous nudity than usual.At first I refused to watch this movie because the plot sounded like the typical teen flick adventure involving a nerdy guy who fells in love with the porno actress and she falls in love with him. Well, that's what happens but the plot has many hilarious sub-situations that make you forget about the unrealistic ending.There are many clichès specially talking about the characters, but it works for the movie's purpose.When you think that most situations are predictable; their resolution totally takes you by surprise due to it's creativity and raunchiness.""The Girl Next Door"" is a crude and raw teen movie that might be enjoyed by those who can take more offensive language and situations. But the humor is really creative and the situations are hilarious and great to watch. The characters are likable big time.If you are looking for the typical romantic comedy you will be disappointed big time.Elisha Cuthbert really impressed me because she delivered a performance where she had to be sexy, tender, dramatic, and brave. She delivered more than expected plus she's very beautiful. Emile Hirsch also gives a good performance and it's a likable guy. Timothy Olyphant stole the show in my opinion. The rest of the cast is also very good and seems to be great chemistry between them.The vibe of the movie is really comfortable and that's because of the characters and the porno sub-plot. I mean, the clothes Elisha wears and the whole porn atmosphere is just great.I recommend this one if you are looking for crude sex comedies that take a little more time on plot development.",The Girl Next Door
29,jtindahouse,Gives you a real shock!!!,8,12 January 2006,Right up until the moment it turns quite serious this just seems like your average romantic comedy. But all of sudden without any real warning it becomes serious and throws you right back. I think it was quite a clever technique used by the director because it certainly stopped me from drifting away as I tend to do in movies like this. The rest of the movie is quite good delivering a good moral and a nice little twist at the end. The acting was above par on the whole and the movie moved around constantly not allowing itself to drift which most romantic comedies tend to do.So overall worth checking out but don't expect to be left breathless after wards (maybe if anything from Elisha Cuthbert).,The Girl Next Door

Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) is stunning, charming, personable, and she likes Matt. But can she reconcile her past - which is always pulling her back - with his present?At alternate times, I laughed VERY hard and cringed even harder.

Every smile, every time she bit her upper lip, males everywhere got a little sweatier.

31,dee.reid,"Not as clever as ""Risky Business,"" but more daring than ""American Pie""",10,24 August 2004,"It wasn't long before and after the release of ""The Girl Next Door"" that the inevitable comparisons to the teen sex comedies of yesteryear began.  But I begin with rock-solid reassurances that those comparisons are unnecessary and uncalled for.  It's not as clever as the 1983 comedy starring Tom Cruise, but it's more daring in its exploits than ""American Pie.""""Risky Business"" was released in 1983 amidst a blossoming season of raunchy teen movies (and so was ""The Girl Next Door"") and both films featured a young man (Tom Cruise then, Emile Hirsch here) who are on their way to bright futures but get caught up in the mess they've made following a brief walk on the wild side.  Their stepping into the wild side is initiated by a chance meeting with a beautiful girl who captures their hearts (Rebecca De Mornay then, Elisha Cuthbert here).It is right then that the differences first begin to appear.  Back in good old 1983, when Tom Cruise was just becoming the heartthrob that he is today in 2004, he was a more picturesque definition of a ladies man - being that he had charisma, confidence and sex appeal.  Fast forward to 2004, with rising actor Emile Hirsch, who is more of a flake, definitely less attractive than someone like Tom Cruise, and therefore that makes Hirsch easier to relate to.""The Girl Next Door"" is more daring than ""American Pie"" in its delivery of the raunch.  Guys have dreamed for ages about meeting the ""girl next door,"" who is played perfectly by ""24"" star Elisha Cuthbert and who most definitely looks like the woman of some lonely guy's sex fantasies.  But the thing is, she's a porn star, as Hirsch finds out; this is where ""Pie"" is surpassed. In ""Pie,"" the most a man could do was just dream about being in the same room as Shannon Elizabeth and not screwing up; consequently, that's about as far as poor Jim (Jason Biggs) got in that movie.Did I like ""The Girl Next Door"" when I saw it for the first time on DVD today?  Most definitely, as it is one of the most touching romantic-sex comedies that I've ever seen.  There is not nearly as much raunch here as the previews might lead one to believe.  Sexhounds will be sorely disappointed that sexy Elisha Cuthbert doesn't bare it all in this movie, but several real life porn stars do!The romance between the two leads is sweet and touching; above all, I found it to be more believable than I find most teen sex comedies to be nowadays.10/10",The Girl Next Door

33,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Raunchy antics with heart and unusual gravity,8,21 November 2015,"The Girl Next Door dressed itself up in a bubblegum marketing campaign of American Pie- esque ditziness as well as a promise of sleaze, lowbrow humour and good old fashioned brain dead teen sex comedy sluttiness. Couldn't have subverted expectations more than it did. Don't get me wrong, a whole lot of it is exactly what I just said it wasn't in my first sentence above, but alongside that that super crude, millennial carnality is a story with a head and heart in either hand, and it's mind in the right place. A silly, eye rolling sex- scapade no doubt, but one with well drawn characters, a terrific script, and a wonderful sense of bawdy fun that calls to mind the comforting nostalgia of a National Lampoon flick, married with the off colour tinge of a 60's sex comedy. Nnever does it lose sight of the feelings, struggles and desires of its two lead actors. Emilie Hirsch is equally vulnerable and gutsy as Matthew, a high school introvert with no experience in the realm of all things female. He's tantalized by his new neighbour Danielle, an ex porn star played by Elisha Cuthbert. Cuthbert has never been as good as she was here (not even playing Jack Bauer's daughter) or as goddamn sexy. She balances a tricky role that could have easily strayed into easy titillation with laid back reactions and down to earth charm that carries the movie. She's amused by naive Matthew, eventually attracted, and ultimately smitten. Matthew learns that lust is only skin deep and real attraction comes from stuff like eye contact and conversation, and that sex is only something special when one knows who one is with to begin with. Nice little allegory for eager beaver male youth, and a pearl of wisdom I really wish I was privy to at his age. Trouble arrives in the form of Danielle's horrendously captivating ex boyfriend, porn director Kelly, played with slick acid tongued alpha male sleaze by irresistible Timothy Olyphant, looking like Hugh Hefner had a kid with Wolverine, before he took up the mantle of Raylan Givens. You see, Danielle clearly believes she's no better than a career as a porn actress, and it takes the simple devotion of Matthew, a high school nebbish who has learned to see her as more than just an Old Milwaukee pinup girl at the end of the rainbow, but as the genuine object of his affections, to convince her otherwise. The fact that such a touching arc for both of them exists in such a loud and proud gross out sex romp of a comedy is proof of life from both writer, director and cast alike. This is a fun flick too, every character a whip smart, realistic depiction of people we've all met in our post growing up exploits. Matthew's two hapless high school chums are priceless, payed by a hyperactive, horndog Chris Marquette and an awkward Paul Dano. James Remar, that old dog, shows up in a wink and nudge role as Danielle's hilarious ex boss, porn king Hugo Posh. The film's anchored by the unexpected substance hiding just below its apparently superfluous exterior shell. Plus, it's an absolutely hilarious, raunchy flick that will give you a boner, make you sopping wet with all kinds of bodily fluids, and put a big goofy grin on your face and make you let out a nice romantic sigh all at once.

Since the film only showcases the high 1% of teenagers living in LA county, how can the rest off the 99% of the youth in America relate with this flick?

37,Samiam3,"Overly contrived, unfocused teen comedy which has its moments, but doesn't work",5,3 July 2010,"What sounded like a fun, sexy inventive comedy just stands to prove, that like people or anything else in the world, looks can be deceiving. The Girl Next Door is not entirely dead in the water, but it's disappointing. Comedies can get away with being impossible for sure, but this film starts out rather strait forward, and then progressively defies common sense without adding any real humour or wit to justify it. Everynow and then, I did find myself laughing, (out loud even) but these moments are too few and far between in a rather lame screenplay, which doesn't amount to much.Another problem is the lack of character. I wanted to care for the two love birds that the movie is supposed to be about, but their romance is highly unbelievable and turns out to be the last of the film's interests. We spend more time with characters that really don't have any major importance, and the film's attempts to make them important don't work. So much happens in the film, that about one hour in, you'd think it's about to collapse. Actually The climax is the best part. It is here where the humour is at its best (although that still doesn't say enough) and then in the last five minutes, things get sour again, in the form of a piece of s**t ending which is arguably the most idiotic part, and is totally unsatisfactory. Director Luke Greenfield is so desperate to shock and surprise his audience over the course of ninety plus minutes, that he seems to have forgotten the most important ingredients of the film. The Girl Next Door is bone dry of charm and intelligence, and it's sense of humour is inconsistent and also insufficent. I'll have to say skip this film.",The Girl Next Door
38,triple8,The movie that wouldn't end.,3,11 April 2004,"Girl next door was an interesting movie choice. I went in not expecting much. For the first half hour or 40 minutes I thought I was wrong. The movie had a heart! It seemed reminiscent of those old style 80's teen comedies I love so much. Risky business, as others have mentioned, a little sixteen candles etc etc. So I relaxed and began to get into the movie. Unfortunately, I was wrong yet again.This movie-correction-the MAJORITY of this movie wasn't good. If they could have made this movie with just the first 40 minutes and the last 5 or so, they'd have a keeper, but the middle just torpedoed the whole thing. Here is why. And yes:there will be some SPOILERS:The movie becomes preposterous-violent, corny, not funny and TEDIOUS. It becomes the movie that will not end. There are exhausting tiresome twists thrown in virtually every five minutes that did nothing for me except give me a headache I did not want.This had the potential to be great. It started promisingly enough. Danielle and Matt have lots of chemistry-she brings out his wild side-it's fun and breezy. But the movie just throws to many unfunny pointless curb balls and quickly becomes less a comedy then a wanna be boogie nights-teen style. And it doesn't work. It loses its focus and becomes more then mediocre, just bad. So many scenes are thrown in that are obviously just fillers. They don't need to be there and are not funny-just pointless.We were very disappointed in girl next door-we actually almost walked out at 1 point but the movie was winding up at that point anyway. Although, as mentioned there WERE parts that were good, the movie skimmed over the good parts while highlighting the stupid ones.Kelly should NOT have morphed into A thug-he should have stayed funny if a bit slick. He was great up until the kidnapping scene which was just dumb.There should have been more scenes of Danielle and Mathew falling in love-such great chemistry! such under use of ALL that chemistry!The movie should have wound up at least 20 minutes before it did-maybe more.The end was ridiculous-how did Kelley even know they had MADE that tape? Tedious-and maybe the movie should have wound up with the whole scholarship dinner.In closing-I'd give this 3 out of 10-though the beginning and last few minutes gets an 8 and the soundtrack gets an easy 10. This is not, the worst movie I've ever seen at all-(although pretty bad)-but it wasn't anything near what it could have been.",The Girl Next Door
39,aimless-46,Strictly for the Those with Low Brain Activity,3,15 May 2005,"There is a movie viewer segment of such limited intelligence that they have never been able to experience a movie that actually insulted their intelligence. I understand that ""The Girl Next Door"" was made as a public service to these viewers and deliberately featured a screenplay so dumbed-down that even those just slightly above the moron level could have their first-ever intelligence insulting viewing experience.Start with a mix of ""Risky Business"" and ""Can't Hardly Wait"", extract all elements of charm that characterized those films, and then dumb-down the story as a public service to the brain-activity challenged members of the audience; and you have a good description of ""The Girl Next Door"".But it sure has a nice promotional poster. Elisha Cuthbert looks good posing and she does a decent job playing Elisha Cuthbert (who just happens to be ""The Girl Next Door""), but her range as an actress is too narrow to even be measured. Unfortunately for Cuthbert, ""This"" girl next door (a part most talented young ""actresses"" would love to play) is supposed to be a multi-dimensional character (for those in the target audience this means that the character is really two different people: ""a girl next door"" and a ""young but hardened by experience porn star""). If you have seen the movie and are still confused don't be embarrassed, nothing in Cuthbert's performance would lead anyone to believe she is a ""young but hardened by experience porn star"". That is because Cuthbert herself is not a ""young but hardened by experience porn star"". She would have to ""act"" differently than ""the girl next door"" to communicate this dimensionality to the audience. To do this she would have to be an ""actress"".So give Cuthbert credit for being able to pose for pictures and for being herself-she seems like a very nice girl that I would welcome as my neighbor. For some people that is enough, for those busy with the experience of having their intelligence insulted for the first time it is probably not important. The rest of us we would be hard pressed to find a worse way to spend our time.",The Girl Next Door
40,rosscinema,Risky Business ripoff,2,5 December 2004,"I really wasn't bothered by the ad campaign from the studio trying to pass this off as just another teen comedy with elements of porn in it because I think any subject matter can be made into a good film with the right people but what I hate are clueless opportunists that make films for no other reason than to ripoff ticket buyers. Story is about 18 year old Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) who is getting ready to graduate from high school and has no real life except his studies until he notices his new next door neighbor. After an awkward situation where Matthew watches his neighbor from his bedroom window he finally meets Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) and they start to spend time together where they develop a real relationship until he discovers what her real profession is.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Matthew finds out that Danielle is a porn actress and when he wants to let her know that he still likes her he suddenly meets her former boyfriend/producer Kelly (Timothy Olyphant) who wants her to come back to making films. Things get complicated when Kelly steals $25,000 that was for a foreign exchange student but with the help from his two best friends (Chris Marquette & Paul Dano) Matthew makes a business deal with a porn king named Hugo Posh (James Remar) where they can raise money making a sex education video for high schoolers.This film is directed by Luke Greenfield who is making only his second attempt at being at the helm of a film with the first being the Rob Schneider comedy ""The Animal"" and as silly as that is it looks like a masterpiece compared to this idiotic nonsense. A complete blatant ripoff of ""Risky Business"" but without the visual skill and intelligent script that helped make that film a mini classic. There are so many things that are taken from the Tom Cruise film that it would be impossible to list them all but I can point out two with the first being actor Olyphant being the ""Guido the Killer Pimp"" character. The second is the music with the background score being eerily like Tangerine Dream and at one point the hit Muddy Waters song ""Hootchie Cootchie Man"" is played and that was very prominent in the 1983 film. Hirsch is supposed to be 18 years old but he's able to walk into strip joints and porn conventions without ever being asked for ID and practically every adult character is portrayed as innocuous to everything going on around them. With the exception of a few quick shots this film doesn't even have the gumption to have much nudity in it and it's one of the most tame teen sex comedies I've ever seen and I watched the unrated version! Hard to imagine this film has a cleaner version, what would be the point? Every second that Hirsch's character is on screen I kept expecting him to put on some sunglasses and say ""What the F***"" because the screenplay for this is totally devoid of any type of originality. From being funny and intelligent to some sort of exploitation fare this film fails on every level and doesn't seem to have the nerve to try something creative.

When things are good they start falling apart, culminating with a real bad thing leaving them worst off than when they started but 4.

50,TOMASBBloodhound,Risky Business can rest easy.,5,24 January 2010,"Though not a complete disaster, The Girl Next Door doesn't come close to reaching the status of that 1983 classic it so often tries to imitate. With this film, we have a lot of ideas and an uneven tone that just cannot be formed into a truly worthwhile experience. Some scenes are clearly inspired by the Tom Cruise vehicle of yesteryear, and other ideas seem to have wandered in from such films as Weird Science, or even Something Wild. Though filled with sleazy situations and characters, in the end the film seems to fancy itself as some kind of nostalgic feel-good movie about the most memorable thing about high school for the lead character.Emile Hirsch, a likable kid, stars as Matthew Kidmann. He's an intelligent kid just about to wrap up a successful senior year of high school. All he is focused on is winning a scholarship to pay for his education at a prestigious university. (Harvard? I forget where) Of course his world is turned on its head when a beautiful young woman moves in next door and causes him to make some very bad decisions. Sound like a familiar plot? Making matters worse is the fact that the girl is a porn star, which is a fact his friends soon point out. And her smarmy producer/boyfriend doesn't like this high school kid trying to get his woman out of such a lucrative business. Still sound familiar? It should. Lots of plot complications ensue and the kid is forced to make what we are led to believe is a porno film to raise a bunch of money he lost that would have allowed an exchange student to come to America from Asia.The film probably fails more than anything due to the fact it isn't that funny. There are some laughs here and there, but it doesn't measure up to more raunchy teen films of the day. Lots of stereotypical characters in most scenes. Is it just California high schools where the popular kids pile into convertibles and ride around acting like their lives are the greatest as the less-popular kids sigh when they drive past? Never seen that around my neck of the woods. Here they use pick up trucks. Another big problem is this film's lack of conviction regarding the world of pornography. Lots of talk about sex, but very little nudity. Even in the unrated version. No compelling love scenes here like there were in Risky Business. And the twist ending regarding the film these people make during their prom is more of a cop-out than anything. The film does have a good soundtrack, and Elisha Cuthbert is a welcome sight in every scene. Nice try, but watch Risky Business instead. 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.",The Girl Next Door

ENTER ELISHA. O m G!! Elisha Cuthbert is SO HOT in this movie, she's like the dream girl next door, plus Elisha achieves her level of A+-SUPERHOTNESS without showing any nudity.

52,gregsrants,Reminds me of what teen films used to be,7,11 April 2004,"Oh, to a neighbor like Elisha Cuthbert.  Not that my neighbors are bad. Want a cup of sugar?  Just knock.  Want help will the ball cock in your toilet?  Ring next door.  All of this is incredibly beneficial, but oh, to have a neighbor like Elisha Cuthbert!Elisha plays the 'girl' in the new teen film The Girl Next Door directed by Luke Greenfield (The Animal).  Her name is Danielle and she arrives just when neighbor Mathew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is writing a speech in hopes of getting a scholarship for his portrayal of moral fiber.  But one look at the stripping Danielle from his bedroom window to hers leaves every fiber pointing in a different direction.This small act of voyeurism leads to all sorts of trouble as Danielle notices her admirers' gazing and immediately heads next door to confront young Matthew.  The result of their new courtship would lead to public nudity, breaking and entering, skipping school, taking drugs and everything else that we used to brag about without merit in High School.
And just as everything seems to be going extremely well for the young Matthew, one of his geek buddies reveals her true identity, that of an up-and-coming porn star.  This revelation comes shortly before the arrival of her pimp film producer Kelly (Deadwood's Timothy Olyphant) who throws a wrench into the infatuational plans of the two neighbors and leads Matthew down a path that jeopardizes his endeavor to win the scholarship.   Soon, Kelly and Matthew are attending strip clubs, meeting in Vegas and eventually, the two are involved in a robbery where Matt tries to win the freedom of the young Danielle.Much has been made of The Girl Next Door's resemblance to the 1983 Tom Cruise film Risky Business.  Truly, the comparisons cannot be more obvious. Instead of hookers, we have porn stars.  Instead of a house party, we have a prom, and where there is a family heirloom in play with Cruise's film, Hirsch must pull out all the stops in order to obtain a $25,000 bank account that was amassed to bring a Cambodian teenager to America.But with all these comparisons evident, I enjoyed The Girl Next Door more. The High School situations have been updated, and I believed in how Matthew could be easily drawn into his world of love and admiration, something I didn't feel with Cruise and DeMornay.Don't get me wrong, The Girl Next Door will not have the impact of Risky Business nor will it be the catapult for either Hirsch or Cuthbert that Business was for Cruise.  But it still was a rather enjoyable film.  Not filled with situations bordering on the asinine (see American Pie's 2 through 3), The Girl Next Door was a smart film that resembled a John Hughes film of the early 1980's.  I enjoyed all the characters from the geeks who are trying to find their sexual niche to the awkwardness and mature awakening of Matthew through the ordeal of following his dreams.  Whereas adolescent films recently have skewed into gross out comedy in such entries as The New Guy, American Pie and Van Wilder, The Girl Next Door gives us something fresh, a progressive out of character plot backed by the love of a beautiful woman.All these funny and interesting struggles lead to the senior prom where the result might seem far fetched, but at least it seems as if the director meant it not to be taken with any notion of seriousness.  We understand the good guys from the bad guys and the movie makes no attempts to throw a surprise or two our way.  Maybe in its simplicity, it has found the answer to rejuvenating the youthful film movement.So, back to my original blabbering.   Oh, to have a neighbor like Elisha Cuthbert!  First noticed wearing pink panties in the 2003 popular film Old School, she is something to behold.  But can she fix a ball cock?  Don't answer that!",The Girl Next Door

Just when you think you've got the next twist figured out, you're surprised.  This happens throughout the movie, making The Girl Next Door one of the most charming, smart and subversive teen comedies I've seen in a long time - beautifully written, perfectly cast, a real pleasure from start to finish.  Emile Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert and Timothy Olyphant shine in their respective roles as the young man at a crossroads in his life, the girl next door of the title, equally confused, and the scuzball with a heart who knows he has to do the right thing even if it goes against his 'business instincts.' These characters are not one-dimensional, thanks to the superb writing, nor are they caricatures; they come across as genuine individuals, and the comedy in the film comes not at their expense but rather organically, as part of their journey.

It's less realistic than The Exorcist and it makes less sense than Yellow Submarine. Once I got past that though - and it took some effort - and tried to enjoy it for what it is, I found out it's not a bad movie, either.Even when it tries to pretend to have a message or a point, and it unfortunately does, The Girl Next Door should be taken for entertainment purposes only, and as such, it's pretty entertaining. It's never laugh out loud funny, but it has some humorous moments, some good acting (no, not Elisha Cuthbert... but Tim Olyphant is great, and young Emile Hirsch already shows some talent) and surprisingly, the humor is much less broad and crude than most other teen comedies of its time. In fact, The Girl Next Door, shockingly, is almost family friendly, and its overall attitude is more positive and idealistic than you would possibly imagine. Not that anyone would want to watch it with their family, mind you. The movie has a pretty limited appeal - it probably won't be that attractive to anyone but the 15-21 year old male demographic.

Things change when he finds out she might be from an entirely different side of the tracks...The marketing was somewhat misleading for this flick. Although the concepts are definitely for mature audiences - a porn industry event (sans nudity), two short shots of actual porn, quite a bit of language and adult themes, this movie is not by any means exploitation. The radiant Elisha Cuthbert who we've come to know and love from 24 is beautiful but doesn't have to do any frontal nudity.Its basically a sweet romantic comedy at heart, a coming of age story, and a story about leaving high-school that everyone can relate to.

56,Son_of_Mansfield,From the writer of Van Wilder and the director of The Animal comes...,7,28 March 2005,"a movie that doesn't suck. Emile Hirsh(The Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys) and Elisha Cuthbert(24, Old School) make a cute couple in this sweet natured comedy. The problem is that the movie doesn't make the choice on what kind of a movie it wants to be, so it ebbs and flows within scenes between a sweet romance and a raunchy male fantasy. It could have been both, which would have been far more interesting. A good example is the scene where Eli(a lively Chris Marquette) shows Matt a video of Danielle. All we see are a bunch of unintelligible fleshy shapes. It would have made a bigger impact to see her get incredi-nasty to feel the horror that Matt feels. I assume that since the other two scenes where Elisha could have shown skin were skinless that she didn't want to do nudity. This is one of the cases where it hurts the film, although the scene in the motel is suitably jaw dropping. On the other hand, the stripper scene and Eli porn scenes deny the innocent tone of the film. Despite these discrepancies, the movie is still enjoyable. Timothy Olymphany(Go, Scream 2), James Remar(48 Hours), Paul Dano, and Timothy Botttoms(That's My Bush) add to the fun. Small appearances by Amanda Swinton(American Wedding) and Sung Hi Lee(Playboy Playmate) as porn stars get the blood boiling for the horny. The music is great(Hoochie Coochie Man, Lady Marmalade, and Teenage Wasteland). A fun little movie.P.S. The juice squeezing line sucks a lot.P.P.S.

57,TheOtherFool,"Weird, fun yet uneven",6,26 November 2004,"With all the good intentions this movie may have been made with (a story about growing up, save sex, friendship and the likes), it will probably be remembered most as the movie in which Elisha Cuthbert as Danielle is showing of an awful lot of skin. Not that I, or most of the (male) audience, mind, that is. And it's the filmmaker's own fault the movie is looked upon that way. It starts out with young and inexperienced Matthew (Emile Kidman) peeping at his new nextdoorgirl while undressing. He's attracted to her (hmm, yes what teenage guy wouldn't...) and from that moment on she takes him out to make him feel more secure about himself. When they arrive at a party Matthew just feels he should do something, and there's a wonderful scene in which he just steps over his shyness to kiss her, while David Gray is singing his breathtaking This Years Love. Beautiful scene, very recognizable.But then the movie flies all over the place again, with porn, a political speech, a golden penis, violence and drugs all taking its place. No, seriously. This all makes up for an uneven film, in which the falling in love scenes between Matthew and Danielle, how unlikely they may be, make up for the best scenes of the film.

63,acedj,Very good movie with an even better soundtrack,9,11 November 2019,"This is the story of a high school senior that fall in love with the girl next door. The twist here is that she ends up being a porn star (former) and the shenanigans that ensue when her former boss tries to force her to return to the industry. What is most heartening about this movie, is the way the characters interact, but mostly how Danielle coaxes Matthew out of his shy shell. Emile Hirsch is too new to the craft to have been handed the leading role here. His acting leaves a lot to be desired, but Elisha Cuthbert is a living goddess and shines in this role.
As for the soundtrack, my god did they do a great job picking out the music for this movie. From Teenage Wasteland to This Years Love to Lucky Man, I find myself singing along as much as I do enjoying the story.",The Girl Next Door
64,docm-32304,Very Good Comedy,7,1 February 2021,"Both my wife and I laughed all the way through this film. It's an intelligent comedy with great humor and lovable characters. Timothy Olyphant is hilarious in this.. I highly recommend for those who just want a laugh, looking back at how we guys were back when we were that age",The Girl Next Door
65,christian123,Funny Movie,4,21 November 2004,"Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is a teen over-achiever from a well-to-do community, who falls for the super sexy girl watching the house next door (Elisha Cuthbert). As they get closer, he finds out that she is secretly a porn star, something that he must try to come to terms with as he suddenly finds himself wit a lot of new male friends.The premise sounds pretty good and the film turned out to be pretty funny. The story isn't very original though. It's similar to Risky Business as every film critic has bothered to point out. That didn't bother me though since The Girl Next Door is still an entertaining comedy. Some of the jokes were kind of lame and the movie is a little forgettable. After about a week, only a few scenes really stuck with me. The movie remains consistently entertaining during the running time but it doesn't have a long lasting impression on the viewer nor does it have a good repeat value. It's just a harmless teen comedy and it should be approached as one.The movie works pretty well because of its two appealing leads. Elisha Cuthbert is cool and confident as Danielle. She plays the character pretty well and she's also very pretty. Some people are complaining about Elisha playing the role of a porn star because she is not pretty enough. I strongly disagree, she looks stunning in the movie. Emile Hirsch also gives a good performance as Matthew. His character is likable and somewhat interesting. Tim Olyphant plays Kelly and he gives a pretty funny performance, kind of annoying though. Chris Marquette was just annoying as Eli. His character was supposed to be your stereotypical horny teenager but he just tried too hard to be funny.Director Luke Greenfield is not that reliable as a director. He was behind that horrible movie called ""The Animal"" though he surprisingly does a decent job with this movie. He could have shortened the film a little though. 109 minutes was too long for this type of comedy and especially this story. They ran out of ideas and they seemed to be recycling the old ones. The ending was also kind of weak and not as funny as the beginning or middle. Despite this, I still don't understand why this movie bombed at the box office. It wasn't great but it was a fun way to spend two hours and it the movie does keep the audience entertained. In the end, this is one of 2004's best comedies and it's worth checking out. Rating 7/10",The Girl Next Door
66,theshadow908,A teen comedy that actually has a good story!,8,25 May 2006,"The Girl Next Door tells the story of Matt Kidman, a highly intelligent high school student who plays it safe so he can get into Georgetown University. When he begins dating his new next door neighbour Danielle, he discovers that she is a former porn star and it throws his life off balance as a series of disturbing events begin to plague him. What I like about The Girl Next Door is that when you look at the cover or see the trailers, it looks like a raunchy sex comedy like American Pie. However, when you watch it you'll see that it's got some very funny moments, but also some touching dramatic moments. It has a really good story that separates it from other teen comedies.All of the actors in this movie do a really good job. Emile Hirsch, who I'd never heard of before this really impressed me with his acting skill. He definitely has the potential to move on to greater things. I've seen Elisha Cuthbert in different things like Popular Mechanics for Kids and Are You Afraid of the Dark, but this is her breakout film. Not to mention that she is one of the most smoking hot actresses in Hollywood today, but that's besides the point. She plays her role really well. Timothy Olyphant is hilarious as Danielle's manager.Another good thing about The Girl Next Door is that if you look beyond just the movie, you'll see the film actually has useful messages. Overall, this movie is above and beyond any other teen comedy, and everyone involved deserves congratulations on a job well done.8/10",The Girl Next Door
67,Hunky Stud,where are the Asians?,7,14 March 2007,"I was not going to write a comment, but I was just thinking how come I didn't see any Asians in this film? I started to notice about this phenomena ever since I saw the film ""Minority report"" which did not have any Asian actors in them.Have you ever seen an Asian male jock in any of the Hollywood high school or college movies? I don't think that there is one. There maybe some Asian girls as the popular students, but I have never seen any Asian males in any leading characters in any high school or college movies.That guy Sannang reminds me of the Asian character in ""Breakfast at Tifannys"" which was very racially offensive to all Asians. Even though Sannang is supposed to be very smart, but look at him, he talks like an idiot, and he looks funny. The whole high school was laughing at him when his video was shown. The director chose to make him a ""smart"" student, that did not reduce his true intent which is to make fun of this Asian in degrading ways. That is very wrong. If he chose an African student to make fun of, would the blacks tolerate such a thing? I don't think so. If he wants to make fun of Asians, at least he should have hired another Asian actor for a positive role. Asians should not be silent again, we should not just take it for granted that Asians should be invisible in Hollywood movies! In this film, all the jocks are white, the protagonist and his two friends are also white. The teachers are also white. The only Asian female actor was a porn star in this movie. The high school is supposed to be somewhere outside of Los Angeles. Asian students can be found in almost all California high schools, how can it be possible that in that particular high school, there was no Asian students? It doesn't make sense that those ""jocks"" were willing to make a video with those porn stars. And when Kelly wants to have a private talk with Matthew at the end, where did the principal go? How did Matthew become the president of the student body if he is not even popular? How can Kelly get a whole bottle of Ectasy drug directly from the glove compartment, what if he the police stops him one day and search his car? And his parents were OK to let him to go out with that girl late at night even though they just met?",The Girl Next Door

After he is horrified to find out she is a porn star he realizes that she is a lot more then thst, so he does to a Las Vegas porn convention and not only gets her back, but gets involved with making a sex instruction tape that makes him millions.

69,shanfloyd,One of the most enjoying teen comedies...,8,17 October 2005,"Saying that, the film should not exactly be confined into the name of 'teen flick'. Thanks to Greenfield's excellent handling with the characters and the innovative smart script, the film explores a lot into character development. The characters are not at all stereotypical as expected in such films. Gradual changes that came into them were finely portrayed by the actors too, especially Emile Hirsch. Another accomplishment for the film is that it was able to produce some 'sweet grace' in its romantic atmosphere. Simply, I considered the film multi-dimensional. Clearly the film wasn't intended to be marketed that way.Considering the plot and the storyline, I admit there had to be some clichés. It was never Greenfield's intention to make an art film with this plot after all. But he handles sex and nudity in brilliant mastery to make it suitable for teenagers. The basic story may be inspired by ""Risky Business"" but there were touches of Greenfield's innovative thinking and smart plot twists everywhere.And Elisha Cuthbert has everything the viewers' masculine urges can possibly wish for. Besides giving us the best visual treat possible under a no-nudity contract, she also gives a nice performance. Keeping in mind her talent, the screenwriters could explore her character a bit more in my opinion, like her background. Yet she makes it sure that people who like this film would follow her career quite earnestly afterwards.",The Girl Next Door
70,Darkest_Rose,How do you want Me?,5,22 April 2004,"This movie revolves around a young man named Matthew Kidman(Emilie Hirsch) who is about to graduate but has absolutely nothing to write in his yearbook and nothing interesting to remember his school year by. Until, Danielle(Elisha Cuthbert), moves in next door and in Matthew's eyes and I'm sure to most of us in the audience, she is an angel sent from above. Danielle and Matthew become friends and start to develop into something more until Matthew finds out that Danielle is actually a porn star and that's when trouble starts brewing, misleading Matthew and his friends into many dangerous adventures.I enjoyed half of this movie and for the other half, I couldn't wait for it to finally finish. It's a nice little, interesting and sexy story but there are just too many messy and useless moments that at the end, you forget what the movie was really all about and wonder what was ever really the point, since the movie seems to drag on forever with no real meaning. The cast tries hard to make it work but the dialogue doesn't seem to agree with them. It's a very forgettable movie but still entertaining overall with some funny situations and a great soundtrack. I would give The Girl Next Door 5/10",The Girl Next Door
71,mcjensen-05924,Decent Start But Deteriorates Fast,2,4 September 2021,"This was one of the biggest steaming cow pies of the genre I've ever seen. Yes it starts kind of cute although in reality the the female lead here would have of course had nothing to do with the brainy neighbor next door, who plays the male lead. But it was kind of fresh and funny, even though all Cuthbert's character did was give sexy glances and look seductive. It's really all she's good for in any role. The pieces start to not fit together pretty quickly though, right around the time the producer shows up. Then we get nothing but ridiculous plot twists and completely idiotic, juvenile scenes that just strain credibility way beyond the breaking point. Even the main actors seemed to all of a sudden forget how to act, as if they knew the movie had veered into the realm of the absurd. For example: The dumbest speech is given at a banquet, and not only does it get lauded but a standing ovation at that. And it was horrible! And what kind of an idiot would say that a classic GYO muscle car is for fa*s. It's the toughest car ever built! Just mindless things like that. And it went on and on and downhill from there. Dialogue beyond awful and silly overacting. Sappy eye rolling little scenes and talks. The whole end sequence at the prom was beyond asinine as well. That movie could have been filmed anywhere but why they decided to film it at the school was just dense. His bumbling friends really get tiresome towards the end as well. His parents, and all the adults for that matter, were portrayed as simple minded clowns. But expecially his parents. Sooooo clueless......And excuse me, but there's no way a bank teller would give that amount of money without verifying a signature. These are not small holes, they're huge gaps that sink the credibility of an entire movie.",The Girl Next Door
72,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,marketing is deceiving...one of the sweetest movies in years,10,3 March 2006,"The Girl Next Door's tagline ""Matt didn't see her coming...but all his friends have!"" is very deceiving, because the movie is not like that at all. When you see this, you'll expect a raunchy, borderline porn movie, but what you get is a refreshing, adorable, and sweet love story with great performances from Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert.Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch, The Emperor's Club, Lords of Dogtown) is not a geek by any means. He's your everyday nice guy who's never really 'lived'. He is the top student, the class president, and he's in charge of bringing a teenage super genius to the U.S.A. Everything is going fantastic, because he even gets accepted to Georgetown. Only problem is, he needs the money to get to the school, and this can only be paid by winning a scholarship. A few days before his speech on why he deserves the scholarship, Matt meets Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert, '24', Weezer's 'Perfect Situation video), a breathtakingly beautiful girl who (after a hilarious few scenes where they meet) he instantly falls for, and she falls for him.For the first part of the movie, you see Danielle, the near unfairly sexy girl, push Matt to limits he hasn't gone to, such as running in the street naked, swimming in a stranger's pool, and skipping school. They're falling in love, and it's easy to see on screen, and it's adorable.Just when it can't get any better for Matt, things take a turn for the worse. One of his best friends, Eli (the hilarious Chris Marquette), who is a massive porn addict, goes through his collection, and finds a tape...and who is the star? Danielle. Turns out, Danielle had just quit her job as a porn star and decided to turn over a new leaf. After a near tear-jerking scene, Danielle returns to her old career by contacting her old boss, a gritty and suave porn producer named Kelly (Tim Olyphant). It's at this point that Matt decides that he doesn't care about Danielle's past, and he's in love with her. He decides that he'll do anything to get her back, including taking on Kelly, the porn industry, and some very weird people.After some events, the plot strays away from just Matt and Danielle, and thickens to become a real movie, not just a teen movie. The movie does an excellent job of keeping us interested, because just as the plot becomes serious, Eli and Matt's other friend, Klitz, add some very funny moments and ideas. Yes, the movie does sound like the classic Risky Business, but it does things that separate itself from that movie. The chemistry between Hirsch and Cuthbert is magical, and despite her gigantic sex appeal, the character of Danielle is so lovable for how sweet and caring she is to Matt. There are some great plot twists that keep you interested, not to mention hilarious in jokes and one liners, and not to mention a classic quote: ""The juice was worth the squeeze"". You'll understand. Tim Olyphant is great in a somewhat opposing role, and veteran actor James Remar makes a few appearances as a porn producing giant. The movie's ending is so great and funny that you can't help but enjoy, not to mention mysterious, keeping you hanging by a thread the whole way through.Luke Greenfield has directed a movie that is so well liked and cherished, that I have never heard a bad thing against this film (I'm 17, and all my friends, guys and girls, loved it). I own it on DVD, and have watched it at least 10 times. I've finally gotten around to writing a review, because writing this has reminded me of how great this movie is. In a few one word sentences, The Girl Next Door is...fun. hilarious. sweet. lovable. classic.

74,illbebackreviews,An extremely funny yet believable rom com!,9,14 February 2013,"I normally am not much of a fan of Rom Com movies as most focus around sex too much and as a result, are mostly trying too hard to be funny and entertaining. This movie, however, is very different.The story is about a ""to graduate"" high school whose life changes on its head after he meets ""the girl next door"" She is an ex-porn star simply trying to live a life away from what she hates when the two really fall in love.The story in the movie was actually extremely entertaining all the way through. I really thought it was superb for that reason. The acting was well...good. It wasn't bad but then again, these type of movies, you shouldn't expect professional acting by the whole cast. The characters were witty, entertaining and just likable and our protagonist is a person we can relate to. The chemistry between Danielle's character and Mathew was good. The dialogue was great and the jokes were plentiful and funny. The direction of the film was actually great and this truly is an underrated movie. Definitely a movie that should be checked out.

If she were really serious about making a fresh start, she'd be working a legit job, call the cops the second Kelly showed up, and dress like a librarian!Matt's moral compass is even more off! How do you go from resolving to lead a moral life to win a scholarship to deciding the only way you can save the day is by having on-camera sex?Hirsch looked like an underage Leonardo DiCaprio, and Cuthbert a young Deborah Harry, which made their characters' hook-up downright creepy.

77,HelloTexas11,pretty cheesy teen sex flick,4,5 July 2008,"'Risky Business' may develop a reputation like that of 'Easy Rider'- a good film that people come to wish had never been made because of all the cheesy imitations it spawned. Exhibit 273- 'The Girl Next Door,' yet another adolescent sex fantasy masquerading as a 'coming of age' film or something similarly high-minded. What are the ingredients? First, a teenage boy's wet dream come true, a drop-dead beautiful girl who takes an interest in him for no apparent good reason. In this case, she's an ex-porn star who moves in next door. Uh huh. Mix in the usual group of geeks, nerds, bullies and situations requiring a prurient spin on almost everything, the requisite wild parties and car rides, the late night dips in someone else's swimming pool and sexual escapades at the senior prom... you know the drill. 'The Girl Next Door' has a few ideas of its own, but not many good ones. The film thinks that by quickly disowning what are essentially soft-core porn scenes and suggestions by having one character or another disapprove of them, it's perfectly justified in showing them in the first place. This is the equivalent of showing a bunch of teenagers a skin flick and then saying, ""that's what you shouldn't do."" As though that's the lesson they'll draw from it. Elisha Cuthbert plays the title character, Danielle; in appearance, she's sort of a cross between Debbie Harry and Cameron Diaz. Emile Hirsch is the teenager in question. They both give likable enough performances, considering the circumstances, but they are dragged through teen-flick cliché after teen-flick cliché. The initial attraction, the misunderstanding, the falling out... the scenes where she tells him to just leave her alone, the reconciliation. Strictly paint-by-the-numbers stuff. And actually, while Cuthbert is on screen a lot, she doesn't have much to do in the second half. At least it seems that way. Maybe she just doesn't have anything interesting to do. The less said about the supporting players, the better, except one character type I am REALLY getting tired of, and that's the wise-ass best friend who acts as though he knows the ways of the world and is always offering inane advice. If nothing else, it all makes you realize how well-made a film 'Risky Business' was. But that movie had a real script, and two real actors- Tom Cruise and Rebecca De Mornay. There was a fair amount of titillation in 'Risky Business' too. I would say the distinction between it and what we see in 'The Girl Next Door' is fairly obvious. To be fair, 'The Girl Next Door' isn't the worst of these kind of flicks. There are some funny bits here and there; Timothy Olyphant as a Fonzie-ish porn producer almost succeeds in making his a real character, and has some funny lines. But to say this film doesn't quite rank with the dregs of teen sex comedies is definitely damning it with faint praise.",The Girl Next Door

79,mr_popcorn,The Girl Next Door,8,27 October 2008,"""Matt never saw her coming... but all his friends had!"" Boy meets girl who's already met all sorts of boys and girls in this teen-slanted comedy. Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is a straight-laced and highly ambitious high school student who plans to study at Georgetown University and dreams of a career in politics. While most of his classmates are in the throes of an epidemic of senioritis, Matthew is obsessed with schoolwork and has a hard time relaxing and having fun. But he finds himself a bit less focused on his future career when Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert), a beautiful 19-year-old blonde, moves in next door. Danielle is playful, spontaneous, and doesn't always remember to draw her shades, and before long Matthew is head over heels in love. Danielle soon finds herself taken with Matthew as well, but their relationship takes an unusual turn when he discovers that, before she moved to town, Danielle had a successful career as a porn actress. Matthew is able to convince Danielle that she's cut out for better things in life than appearing in porn videos, but his advice doesn't especially please Kelly (Timothy Olyphant) or Hugo (James Remar), two porn moguls who figure Matthew owes them big-time after convincing their leading lady to drop out of the adult industry. The Girl Next Door -- which, appropriately enough, shares its title with a 1999 documentary about adult film superstar Stacy Valentine -- also features Timothy Bottoms, Paul Dano, and Chris Marquette.Review The Girl Next Door is so full of clichés and just overloaded with cheesiness and yet, after all this I find it quite amusing. That isn't normal of me because I usually despise teeny bopper chick flicks (American Pie makes the cut among a few other classics) and surprisingly, this one makes it on top. Elisha Cuthbert exudes the eroticism and beauty of the character and yet, she didn't over do it, just the right mix. Emile Hirsch, a then unknown, equally shines as well.",The Girl Next Door

81,Ronin47,"Should be a lot better, but it's alright (***)",7,8 June 2004,"This is one of those times that the 3-star rating is mainly a sentimental one. There are many moments in ""The Girl Next Door"", mainly in its first half, that capture that awesome 80's-ness of the best teen comedies of the 80's, but at the same time it's not nearly as good as it should (and easily could) be. Obviously heavily inspired by the 1983 Tom Cruise teen classic ""Risky Business"" (even the score mimics the ""Risky Business"" score at key moments), it's about an ambitious but indifferent high school senior named Matthew (Emile Hirsch, ""The Dangerous Lives Of Altar Boys"") whose comfortable world is thrown into disarray when the stunningly beautiful Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert, from TV's ""24"") moves in next door. They strike up a relationship the kind of way that you only see in the movies, but it's very entertaining (and like ""Risky Business"", it's more about teenage wish-fulfillment than reality), so I didn't mind. Then things get complicated when Matt learns, through his porn-addicted friend Eli (the hilarious Chris Marquette), that Danielle is a porn star.
In the first half, ""The Girl Next Door"" is a lot of fun. It's well-paced, interesting, funny, and the soundtrack keeps throwing great songs at you. Unfortunately, the second half is dragged down quite a bit by the unnecessary addition of several non-entertaining subplots and characters that distract from what the movie should be about: Matthew's sexual awakening. Still, even though I almost stuck it with a **1/2, there are just enough good scenes and great songs to get a somewhat-shaky but solid recommendation from me. After all, any movie that makes good use of ""Under Pressure"" by Queen and David Bowie AND The Who's ""Baba O'Riley"" (two of my all-time favorite songs) will probably get my vote.",The Girl Next Door
82,oshram-3,We've seen this before,5,13 October 2004,"'Girl' follows the story of one Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) as he encounters new girl next door Danielle (24's Elisha Cuthbert) and gets involved in her life. Turns out she's a porn star, which Matt's friend Eli (Chris Marquette) lets him in on. So naturally the movie takes several zany twists and turns, from the kids going to Vegas to stalk Danielle at a porn movie convention to Matt getting mixed up with Danielle's dangerous manager, Kelly (Timothy Olyphant). There are enough twists and turns to keep things lively, and enough laughs to entertain most of the time.Hirsch is effective as Matt; he plays his innocence well, and has enough young boy charm and good looks to win the viewer over. Cuthbert, resembling here a sexier, more beautiful version of a young Debby Harry, is also fairly good, switching back and forth between normal girl and porn star fairly well. Most of the supporting cast is fine; Olyphant is particularly sharp, and I enjoyed Marquette, but that's probably because he reminded me of a smart ass I knew in high school (he even looked like him). In fact, overall, the film is reasonably entertaining.There's just one catch; you've seen this movie before, and it was called Risky Business. Virtually everything is the same; the hooker is now a porn star, and we're freeing a Vietnamese genius student rather than repairing daddy's Porsche, but in essence the movie is exactly the same, from the young guy falling for a much more experienced partner to the menacing manager (Olyphant was good, but he's no Joe Pants) even to the very way they choose to absolve the main character's debt. The movie follows Risky Business page for page, even closely substituting the obscene catch phrase with one very similar to it. In some respects this film exceeds its source material  Elisha Cuthbert is far better than Rebecca De Mornay, whom I never really thought was any good in the first place  but Hirsch is no Tom Cruise, and in the end, you're just basically getting the same story with some of the rougher edges sanded down told to a new generation. Worth looking at if you don't mind that, but be aware that's exactly what you're getting.",The Girl Next Door
83,jrfranklin01,Every Teen Guy's Fantasy...Almost,7,20 March 2005,"For those of you who saw ""Milk Money"" with Melanie Griffith, this movie runs along the same lines. Basically, you have a beautiful woman with a seedy background who falls in love with your average guy living in the burbs. ""The Girl Next Door"" takes things down to a teen level though when a former porn star moves in next door to a boy and steals his heart. Elisha Cuthbert (sure to be famous for her sizzling looks alone) plays the former porn star Danielle. Emile Hirsch plays head-over-heels Matthew Kidman. The film teeters a bit on how convincing it is, despite the unusual circumstances. It's interesting to note how Matthew treats Danielle like the sex toy he thinks she is when he discovers her past. I think this stigma or stereotype is probably true for most guys and how they think of porn stars, which makes a serious relationship all but impossible. What is unconvincing is how Danielle goes along with this. But perhaps she's just used to being treated this way even though she clearly wants a different future. I guess on a serious note and looking at the bigger picture, you could look at the whole film and wonder how realistically it portrays a porn star's life. Are there those that want to quit and just can't seem to get out of the industry, either because they are under duress or just don't have any skills...? And what about their boyfriends, husbands, etc.? Do they and should they accept their career choices or is there a better and more wholesome life out there they can help them achieve? I don't mean to sound too didactic, as ""The Girl Next Door"" is just a love story (obviously a bit complex though). Don't worry about the film being as serious as I am in its description. Plenty of laughs and nail-biting moments are had with a funny and surprising ending. 7/10",The Girl Next Door

But her looks worked on me he did brilliantly and well a happy cool ending.,The Girl Next Door
85,rcavellero,GO WITH IT...,9,9 April 2004,"It's hard to explain The Girl Next Door and why it's such a great film. But trust me it is, and go see it. It's 100 percent fantastic. I went into the film with mediocre expectations at best. But this film completely exceeded them. I could have gone in with high expectations and still been completely satisfied but going in with slighter expectations has left me completely astounded everything about this film screams professionalism. As it starts off with a collage of High School life done to yearbook pictures and nostalgic music of mostly anyones childhood. it's the feelings it brings forth that inspires memory and classic nostalgia. your only wishing at this point that the film could keep up this feeling through out it and does it one better and creates something completely original, somewhat magical and totally believable.  But as for the films plot which is filled with more depth that you can hardly imagine. It opens with a young man whom is questioning his HS years and their lack of enertaining memorabilia. Than enters the girl next door a young woman played by the beautiful and completed talented Elisa Cushbert of 24 and she is a stunner believe me when I say that. He meets her, she meets him issues ensue and she decides to give him the memories he's in search of just because of the innocent way he looks at her. But she has a secret you see she's no ordinary girl she's actually a porn star whom just quit her job trying to find a more suitable and respectful career. One she has settled into because a lack of better choices and because of the way she's always been treated. Now with the synopsis I am gonna completely stop there because to give anymore away would be wrong and if I did you'd probably be like what the hell is this? and never see it. But trust me it's worth any price you would pay and completely worth a viewing. The film is completely layered and three dimensional. It's beautifully written and the characters and their performances are smart and sexy. Although the film appears to be a sex comedy it's that  sex appeal that it usues to draw you in and than drops you over on it to teach the audience an apporpriate and heartfelt lesson. With all the cliches and silliness pushed to the absent side. The performances, direction and writing are all inspiring and you can expected to see these talented faces and names headline cinema for years to come. This film rocks it's almost everything you could want of in a movie. As it moves along it gets better. And when it ends your completely satisfied and you will carry a well deserved smile through the entire day following and whenever you decide to discuss it. Intelligent, provocative, sexy, funny, dramtic, emotions these are all things that describe this film but I'll use the credo that one character lives by and passes it on to others. Who cares what people think just go with it!!!! And run out and see this.",The Girl Next Door
86,Chromium_5,Idiotic movie for idiots,1,28 December 2005,"I have to admit, when I finished watching this, I was not entirely sure if I had seen a good or a bad movie. I thought maybe the incoherent, surreal, nonsensical lack of a story was intentional, that maybe this was multilayered and deep and I missed the symbolism or something. I thought about it for a good, long, hard 10 seconds, then decided that no, it was just trash. I mean, sometimes it can take hard work to make a movie this weird, but I'm pretty sure this was by accident.Let me put it to you this way: if you were amused by the phrase ""long, hard 10 seconds"" in the above paragraph, you will think this movie is a classic. Actually, no, you probably won't. You will be disappointed because there is no nudity. That's right: a movie about porn stars and the porn industry, and that condones porn as a good thing, has NO NUDITY. What the hell kind of message is THAT sending? I'm not even going to bother explaining the plot, because there is none. There's about a thousand different climaxes (haha, I said climaxes), and the movie contradicts its own attitude toward porn even more times than that. If you can make sense out of this mess, consider yourself a genius (or an idiot. I'm not sure).Other users have mentioned the movie's depiction of Asians is ""borderline racist."" I think the word they're looking for is ""downright,"" not borderline. Here's a true story: when I was 12, I started taking a tally on how many American comedies attempt to get laughs out of minorities swearing in goofy accents. Including this movie, that number has now surpassed 5 trillion (and the only time it has ever been funny was in ""Office Space""). Anyway, if you think an Asian kid wearing huge glasses and talking like Elmer Fudd is high comedy, this is the movie for you. If, however, you are not a racist dumbass, you'll want to avoid ""The Girl Next Door,"" and stick to something a little more watchable, like ""Manos: Hands of Fate.""",The Girl Next Door

The young leads, Emil Hirsh and Elisha Cuthbert are in the same roles as Cruise and DeMornay, but with far less acting talent but same amount of puppy fat. Geeks, footballers, and porn stars at the prom recreate the night to ""walk like a man"" but without the originality. In the crazed pimp-psycho role first created by the excellent Joey Pan, is HBO's Deadwood hotter than hot sheriff-good guy, Timothy Olyphant, in the role of a looser porn promoter. He brings the only chops to this otherwise been there, done that premise.This snooze fest is so cliché ridden that the ending is worse than predictable, its yuppie-puppie-spawn spew.

88,yongkang-27205,"Kind of cheesy, kind of dumb, but yet surprisingly great",9,10 September 2021,"Wow. I know that this film falls sorely in that raunchy teen movie catagory. But for such a film, it was done really well. While yes like all of these films it's most definitely a raunchy comedy, but it was made such that this did not become an overwhelming focus. Instead, the plot was actually great! Some parts are typical, but there's just enough change that makes it a worthwhile watch. And wow, I did not expect that ending. And for a feel good romantic comedy, it sure was done well. I was left smiling with a heavy feeling in my heart.",The Girl Next Door
89,SeminolePhenom,The romantic comedy that men can enjoy.,8,8 August 2005,"The story is about Matthew Kidman(Emile Hirsch) who has never taken any risks in life. He makes straight A's, hangs out with really dorky friends, and plans his senior year around getting a scholarship. It seemed like he has his whole life planned when a girl named Danielle(Elisha Cuthbert) who happens to be a porn star, moves in next door.The movie is just an all around great romantic comedy. It's hilarious while also being very well done. It teaches a lesson that almost everyone should learn from: Don't take life so seriously! Elisha Cuthbert does a great job and definitely acts well as a sexy, porn star. Overall, the movie was just plain great! Always know if the juice is worth the squeeze, and trust me this movie is worth watching.I highly recommend this movie.",The Girl Next Door
90,Keemshave,Underrated romantic comedy.,7,7 June 2021,"In many respects, this film is overlooked and underrated.Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert have fantastic chemistry and make for an easy couple to root for throughout the film. Timothy Olyphant plays a charismatic and enigmatic villain who is also entertaining to watch.Some of the scenes aren't well-written, but they're compensated for by a strong message and highly well-written verbal cues, which include callbacks to lines from earlier in the film.This film has far higher reachability than most, and I applaud it for that.",The Girl Next Door
91,Boggman,"Not the typical girl next door.....,",6,31 August 2005,"This movie is mindless fun. It's not as good as your ""American Pie"" or early 80's sex comedies (i.e. Porky's, Last American Virigin), but it does have a little bit of heart to go with all the overblown fluff.Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is just your everyday average nerdy senior- whose never even gotten close to getting laid. He's terribly envious of all the popular kids in school who seem to be having the time of their lives. Howver, he's so out of their league that he really is quite pathetic.Enter Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) the new girl next door. After Mathew lamely busts himself by getting caught watching Danielle change by the window, and a quick act of revenge by Danielle, the two become friends.Mathew is too much of a wimp to make a move on Danielle, but she eventaully eases him out of his shell more and more each day. When at a party and one of the jocks begins hitting on Danielle, Matt finally makes his move and kisses Danielle. Looks like the kid has some balls after all! Good job Matt.Matt eventually finds out that Danielle is a washed up porn star, and she has moved in next door to start a new life as a clean and wholesome girl. That is until her ex boyfriend and manager Kelly (Timothy Olyphant)strolls into town to haul her off to the annual Las Vegas porn connection.After Matt blows Danielles cover and makes her feel like the tramp she once was, she decides to high tail it with Kelly. Matt is completely whipped over her by this point and begs her not to go -but als, she bails anyways.Matts balls have gotten pretty big by now, and he takes off to rescue her from the clutches of her evil pimp. Eventually after Danielle returns home- Kelly comes back with a vengeance for Matt - causing him to lose the school funding he has been working on to bring a foreign exchange student to his school. He also manages to slip him some Ecstatsy - on the very night he has to give a speech in an attempt to gain the scholarship to college that he has worked so hard for.Nerds and porn stars eventually come together to hatch a plan to raise the money once again - this time by making their own porno right at their very own school.""The Girl Next Door"" is the kind of movie I would have enjoyed a lot more as a teenager than as an adult. Now grown up- you realize how far from reality this kind of stuff is--but as a kid- this would have been a fantasy flick that I would have killed to see come true.Overall stupid but enjoyable.Recommended for all you nerdy/horny teens with big dreams and not much else.......",The Girl Next Door

The plot is also nice, about a porno star who falls in love with just another ordinary kid... Emile Hersch also does a nice job, playing that ordinary kid... His friends especially 'Eli' is totally cool, and will bring you on your knees with his antics... I wont say much, cos it will spoil your anticipation...

94,poem,"Alisha Cuthbert is sweet, but otherwise...",4,23 November 2004,"""American Sexuality"" would be the better title for this movie. This is a movie about and exclusively for Americans that make every European yawn - unless of course he is as ignorant, misinformed and puritan as these strange people from overseas.For the movie completely ignores the problems of his theme. These script authors obviously never read any studies about the psychological problems of real prostitutes and pornstars, they never talked with real people of this field, and they're very far behind with the reality of today pornography as well. For example, nobody makes much money with a single porn movie in the internet age anymore. Reading any serious article about the today reality in any political or feminist media would have told you much more than this picture about the problem.Failing on the educational side, the movie isn't entertaining either. It simply lacks real ideas for the story itself, and most attempts to fill the full 90 minutes for a cinema movie look very artificial and don't support any general story. The Hollywood rule 'the story should fit into two sentences' is not followed at all here. I especially disliked it that this movie has not one ending, but about four or so. At multiple stages of the movie every problem was really solved and the end screen could have popped up. Maybe it had even more endings, after the fourth ending I left the cinema out of boredom.",The Girl Next Door
95,tanelteder,squeeze the juice,9,17 January 2011,"The Girl Next Door is a perfect film for the movie night. It's fun, entertaining. It's not that serious, but at the same time it has a point. And I liked a plot a lot. Quite original in my opinion. Credit to director Luke Greenfield for not letting this one to go too out of hands by putting in some intense scenes as well. It's a top notch entertainment.Young actors Emile Hirsch and Paul Dano look very young here. They do fine, especially Hirsch by developing his character. But it is Elisha Cuthbert who steals every minute of the screen. Arguably one of the hottest characters. Her sexiness is irresistible. Jeez, burns like a fire.There is definitely something instructional in this movie. It is summed up nicely in this metaphor used in the movie: 'you got to know whether the juice is worth to squeeze or not.' So squeeze whenever you can. I prefer orange juice.",The Girl Next Door

To be fair it starts getting funny suddenly in the last half hour,before that its boring as hell . After an hour of a uncharismatic ,lantern jawed teenager mooning over a girl and endlessly boring people over his college scholarship interview,it suddenly morphs into a hilariously bad taste comedy for the last stretch.

99,Decko_koji_obecava,The line between sexy and sleazy is so thin.,2,17 February 2007,"When it comes to most teen flicks one should always remember to set brain activity knob to LOW and expect a steady amount of crap. However, that knowledge couldn't remotely prepare me for the pile of excrement that is this movie.It was nauseating! Unoriginal plot, badly executed story and brain cell killin' script aside, it's the overall obnoxiously smutty atmosphere that is the most offputting aspect of this mess.Successful morphosis of ""American Pie"" and ""Risky Business"" was obviously the goal here (it even says so on the DVD box), but, boy, did they miss the target. As dopey as those flicks are, they pretty well seem like masterpieces in comparison to ""The Girl Next Door"". They at least dealt with sex and innuendo in a cheerful manner, whereas here everything is so sleazy and devoid of any fun.Avoid at all costs.PS: Elisha Cuthbert, the chick playing the title role, became semi-known on a Canadian show 'Popular Mechanics for Kids' where she played a smart goody-two-shoes with all the answers, but in taking this role she became a victim of some terrible career advice.Perhaps the thinking was that she's certainly hot enough physically to join the likes of Lindsay Lohan, Hillary Duff, Olson twins and other Hollywood jail baits being worshiped by teenyboppers and middle-aged pervs the world over - and no quarrel there - however, instead of being catapulted into their echelon she will, likely forever, be banished down to the Elizabeth Berkley territory. Releasing a home-made sex tape would've probably done about the same amount of damage to her long term Hollywood career as this squalid stinker likely will.",The Girl Next Door
100,colettesplace,"It's Risky Business-lite...a generic, but relatively inoffensive time-waster",5,21 December 2004,"Comparison with 80s hit Risky Business is inevitable for this romantic comedy about a high school student dating a porn star.Innocent A-student Matthew (Emile Hirsh), who is bizarrely both class president and unpopular, is transformed by meeting uberbabe Danielle, the girl next door, played by 24's Elisha Cuthbert. Their path to happiness is interfered with by a variety of characters, including themselves, Matthew's latently gay wannabe filmmaker buddy and Danielle's sleazy former producer slash boyfriend, Kelly. Go's Timothy Oliphant dominates the film with this role  Kelly is simultaneously dangerous, tempting and unpredictable.Directed by Luke Greenfield (The Animal) and scripted by Stuart Blumberg (Keeping the Faith), The Girl Next Door intersperses saccharine moments (for example, Matthew's botched speech) with cheeky asides, such as Matthew's involuntary porn fantasies. It's no classic but it works, thanks to committed performances from the three leads. Although Cuthbert's role is undemanding, newcomer Emile Hirsch gives good camera as the earnest, yearning Matthew. There's also some cheeky plot twists and the ending is great fun. **½/***** stars.",The Girl Next Door

102,tom-456,so-so remake of Risky Business,5,9 April 2004,"The similarities in the story with Risky Business are so strong as to be unmistakable.  There are some differences, mainly in the sweetness of the relationship between the main characters Matthew and Danielle.  This made the movie somewhat enjoyable, but all in all, the story was simply lacking in original elements.  I like Elisha Cuthbert, but I think that in this case the casting of her in this role was based on her present appeal and not because she was the best actor for this particular role.  She does a very good job, but it is still just too hard to believe her as a porn star. Maybe it would have been more believable if she hadn't been so sweet (if it is possible for Elisha to not be sweet) but then if she hadn't been sweet, it would have been hard to believe that Matthew would have fallen for her. This suggests a fundamental problem with the concept, which is no surprise, but it still would probably have come off better if the Danielle character had been cast with someone a little more believable as a porn star.  Then again, what is going to sell this movie is not its believability, but the appeal of the two main characters for the teenage dating couples that will be the main audience for this movie.  I like Elisha (did I already say that?) but I don't think that this sort of light-heated comedy suits her, and I would much rather see her in a major role in a serious action-drama of some sort.  This sort of fluff is not going to do her any good, and she is far more talented, so she should try to skip past these sorts of roles and go straight for the first serious role that comes her way.All in all, this is decent date movie for a older teens and younger twenty-somethings who don't object to the R-rated theme and the small dose of nudity.  You won't see Elisha nude, by the way, and I admire her determination to not cede to what surely must have been some very heavy pressure for her to appear partially nude.",The Girl Next Door
103,scoup,"Went into this not expecting too much, but...",8,19 March 2012,"The Girl Next Door is now a favorite movie in the teen genre.Initially I was going to rate this a 7 but there are great plot twists that sneak up on you just when you think you know where it is going; so in all fairness this movie gets the 8 for not standing idly in cliché land.Emile Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert and Timothy Olyphant gel nicely as the leads. There were many laugh out loud moments including the AVN convention and the prom, but the awards dinner was possibly the best (tie scene and dancing).While Emile and Elisha produce good chemistry and provide the plot foundation, it is the antagonistic relationship between Emile (Matt) and Timothy (Kelly) that keep you loving this movie. I could watch another movie based on these two alone.The supporting cast of nerd friends serve the film well and provide excellent comedic relief.On pondering what changes would make this movie rate as 9-10, I am still unsure because pushing the boundaries further might also push the movie too far across the absurdity line. However The Hangover was absurd and that was great fun, so I'll stick with the rating of 8.It's unfair to label this movie as just a teen comedy because its got more juice and more squeeze than most.",The Girl Next Door
104,RoBiN_SinGH211221,Must Watch Teen Comedy Entertainer Movie,7,10 January 2021,"This is certainly one of the best teen love stories I have seen. All the actors played parts beautifully, especially the protagonists, Hirsch, Cuthbert and Olyphant and the movie keeps you glued to your sit till the end.This is the story of matthew(Hirsch) who doesn't know how to have fun in his life. Matthew is the college president and is about to graduate and then 'she' enters his life and changes everything. Danielle(Cuthbert) moves in into the neighbourhood of Matthew and Matthew falls for her the moment he sees her. Then he finds out that Danielle is in fact a pornstar but he is so much in love with her that he does everything that he can to get her. Will he succeed? And if he does, at what cost?One of the weird things about this movie is that Cuthbert plays a pornstar and we don't even get to see her full frontal but her sheer beauty makes up for it to an extent. Another thing this movie failed to do was that it never digs into the past life of Danielle as to how and why did she became a pornstar.All in all, I think there are more pluses to this movie than minuses. If you like teen love stories then you'll surely like this one too.

105,laymonite-2,Completely unexpected good hearted rom-com,10,26 August 2007,"I was kind of fooled by the marketing of this but it sounded intriguing anyway and I'd learned the lesson that seemingly gross out comedies like American Pie, Old School and The 40 Year Old Virgin can actually be good fun and have a lot more going for them.Do NOT think this is some kind of gross out or tasteless low brow comedy, despite the unfortunate marketing and apparent subject matter. In fact if anything it struck me as a very well crafted old fashioned romantic film at heart (in a good way). This is really probably not the film you think it is.High points. The cast is excellent, absolutely all on top form for every character. The direction, photography and use of music are top notch - everything seems to hit the right note perfectly. You start out thinking you'll see a crass comedy and end up seeing a very skillfully made film, with likable characters and a really good heart at the core of it. It's also extremely funny! Low points. It's very much a fantasy film and very romantic. In this sense it really doesn't touch on it's supposed core theme 'the porn industry' in any realistic way. Porn producers are lovable rogues. AIDS is never mentioned. The whole thing is so wholesome! I don't really think this is a low point as the film is essentialy a romantic fantasy and the portrayal of the porn characters is very funny and in no way meant to be realistic.I really enjoyed it.",The Girl Next Door
106,helencmm,Waste of time. I paused it many times for stupid reasons.,4,24 October 2019,"I didn't really liked this film. It's about a teenage boy and a young porn star and they fall in love each other, but her job is a huge problem and he's trying to help her get out of this.Okay, I don't really understand how could someone think of this storyline. Its plot is so random, that unfortunately, can't really write a review.Again, there's a high schooler, that wants to give scholarship to a really genius poor boy, so the school collect some money. Then, the same boy, falls in love with his neighbour, a young porn star by watching her getting undressed. Of course he belongs to a nerd squad and she's out of his league and he's a virgin, but OF COURSE, she falls for him back. The problem is her job and her silly manager. Our protagonist tries really hard to help her getting out of this, but her manager is money-freak, so it's not easy and then we have a non-pormographic amateur film about the value of protection.See? Is there any point of this film? For me, certainly not! I can't rate it higher. It really gave me nothing.Protection is really important, scholarships are also, but their presentation is very prosaic. And I don't mean that it should have been a drama, because of these topics, but a comedy with smarter script and storyline.I paused it many times for really no reason. I started watching it at 15:00, but I finished it at 19:00.

The characters were attractive ranging from the usual suburban high school cliques to adult film producers and starlets. Eroticism and high school graduation, as a pair, always attracted attention, and this movie capitalized on this taboo reality. Having these polarized yet ancillary characters made most of this movie's humor based on the novelty of the friendships. This movie definitely illustrated the quiet kinkiness lurking in high school academics while addressing issues of moral sexual behavior.

As if it were one thousandth as good as Fast Times! From beginning to end, this movie is ridiculous. The kid is a total geek, and it's completely unbelievable that a hottie ex-porn queen would even spend three minutes in his puppydog slobbering presence. When her sleazy agent (or is it pimp?????) or whatever he is (it's not fully explained), the story takes an even sillier turn, as it is up to the Geek Next Door to save her from going back into the porn industry. This spells a road trip for him and his dork buddy-but they forget they are in Connecticut and somehow end up driving to Vegas in time to make it to school the next day. More asinine capers ensue, none of which are fully explained and insult the viewers' intelligence.The movie is amateurishly filmed and a waste of Elisha Cuthbert's talent. As viewers of 24 know, she's more than just a pretty face-but this movie objectifies her. The script seems as if it were written by a horny 14 year old who fantasizes about the women he looks at in his porno mags and internet sites. A major waste of celluloid trash.",The Girl Next Door

One night while taking out the garbage he sees a beautiful girl walking into the house next door.

Maybe this is somehow fulfilling for those who suffer from sexual repression, but then I think if they had that sort of problem they wouldn't watch this movie in the first place.Or maybe I'm just too old for this. If this is trying to send a message that ""Pretty Woman"" tried to convey, then it surely fails amongst all the breasts, porn references and the mention of the F-word.

112,hedin_88,Its alright.,6,21 February 2013,"What i expect from teenage comedies is nudity, fart jokes and people crashing into things and falling over. don't get me wrong, i like good movies, but i wanted to watch something stupid and relax and instead i got this movie, filled with emotions and touchy feely scenes. Its fun, there are memorable characters and the story goes pretty well to places unseen before. Its just not what you'd expect. I would have loved it more with a few more laughs and a story not entirely focused on two people madly in love and then painfully split up and then getting back together and all that. The cast was great, watching this movie after watching Into the wild really put my focus on Emile and i came to realize why he remained popular and re-cast as he is a pretty good actor. His love interest, played by Elisha is also a great cast- but so is the rest of the crew. Soundtrack fits perfectly into the scenes and is well done. To sum it all up- its a different kind of teen-comedy, more on the feelings and the stupid things kids do for love. I'm just to skeptic to believe in all of it. And i was hoping for a movie a bit more stupid and relaxed than this.",The Girl Next Door
113,Arlis,A funny movie full of heart! If only all comedies were this funny.,10,8 November 2006,"I watched this movie tonight for the first time and wasn't expecting much from it. I am not a big fan of comedies and especially teen comedies. I bought this about 2 years ago and it is the unrated version. I have come to realize ""unrated"" in Hollywood is just a way to make a movie sell. It's like they show you the PG-13 version in theaters and then show you the R version on DVD, yet they call it UNRATED. I am here to tell you its not that nasty - it doesn't push the envelope or shock anyone.BUT....I loved it! It had so much heart and soul that I finished it thinking WOW. I laughed my ass of, I shed tears because it hit some personal notes and I won't ever forget seeing it.I had to give it a perfect 10 rating because it impressed me that much. I loved these characters and thought they were well casted and worked so good together. Not a lot of big actors and I think that helps make a movie seem more real.The story was great and it was very original and I think if you haven't seen this movie then YES go buy it or rent it or whatever because you will like it I PROMISE!",The Girl Next Door
114,LG72387,Not good but not bad,5,26 August 2004,"The Girl Next Door is more than what it had been advertised. Fox chose to market it as a sex comedy, but indeed this film is way more than that. It follows in the footsteps of Risky Business and American Pie and does something that few sex comedies do anymore; give depth to the story. But that doesn't mean that the story is any good. In fact, it is so unrealistic and so overwritten that the film itself starts to get boring. The first half-hour is the most interesting because you care about the characters. However, when they drag in scenes like the one in Las Vegas or the robbery scene, then the story just dwindles so far down into a bottomless pit of nothingness. The screenplay does have some clever nuances like the creation of a new and totally original sex-ed video which would send shockwaves around the country if such a tape were ever released. But at the heart of the story is the relationship between Matthew and Danielle (played well by Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert) which is the most thoughtful thing about this film. But the story drags away from that and slips away from being more decent than it could have been. However, the film is better already in the fact that it is not just a flat sex comedy because then the film would not have any depth whatsoever. So I give credit to the writer and the director for making that happen. However, I guess I have to say that such depth is not enough to make this film good. Lenny's Grade: C+",The Girl Next Door
115,yeah_baby_5,Different but really good.,10,13 May 2004,"The Girl Next Door was an excellent movie and not only because Elisha Cuthbert looked really good in it, it was funny and reminded me a little of American Pie. To avoid spoilers please disregard the next paragraph.************************************************************************
The funniest part of the movie in my opinion is the part where Eli is trying to persuade Matthew to take Danielle to a hotel to do ""you know what"" and how he is literally begging Matthew to do it. But my favorite part is where Matthew is caught spying on Danielle while changing, hee hee.

116,morphion2,Borders on exceeding expectations,7,29 April 2006,"When a teen comedy is released, everyone knows just about what to expect. There'll be a unpopular high school student (""Van Wilder"" chose the maverick route and made him popular) who suffers from either sexual or emotional problems, there'll be a group of flawed but nonetheless faithful friends to help them out and there'll be a hot girl who takes inexplicable interest in Unpopular Student. There'll be a message, a moral, a contemporary soundtrack and a lot of sex. Such were everyone's expectations for ""The Girl Next Door"" Luke Greenfield's 2004 contribution to the genre, starring Elisha Cuthbert and Emile Hirsch, the advertising emphasis on the former.Matthew Kidman (Hirsch) is a slightly repressed, highly unfulfilled near-graduate who aspires to win a scholarship to Georgetown on the basis of Moral Fiber. His dissatisfaction with overall life stems from his seeming incapacity to take a risk, to do something spontaneous and wild. Enter Danielle (Cuthbert), the gorgeous, free-spirited young niece of Matthew's next door neighbor, who is house-sitting for a few weeks. Immediately Matthew falls in love, and it would seem that the attraction is at least semi-reciprocated; for once he is feeling really, truly good about his life. What tips the film over from romantic comedy to teen comedy is not the presence of teenage characters, but the point when Matthew learns the perfect Girl Next Door is a porn-star.If the premise sounds 'typically teen' and derivative of the much more successful 80's flick ""Risky Business"", then that's because it is, on both counts. However, as much as I'd like to dismiss this as yet another thoroughly forgettable, sexploitative perpetuation of a film-genre that hasn't been truly inspired in 20 years, something holds me back. There's a touch of admirableness to this film, a hint of maturity, a vague, familiar scent of a movie that wants to say something, that had more in mind than an admittedly beautiful girl taking her clothes off. The real problem is that, as sweet as the message of love clearly is, the film is just too inconsistent. One moment it's making an almost pertinent point, the next it's having a go at teenage virgins. One moment it's witty, the next it's vulgar. One moment it's smart, the next it's stupid.It's this kind of inconsistency that gives you the feeling that the film-makers had a half-decent idea in their hands, but were, like their lead protagonist Matthew, afraid to take a risk. They border on breaking the mold at some points, but then they lose their nerve and retreat back into familiar but tired cliché. For instance, the opening 45 minutes or so of ""The Girl Next Door"" had me thinking I'd pegged this movie all wrong, even after the revelation of Danielle's profession. The whole thing was handled with astounding maturity, considering what kind of film we're dealing with. ""How do you want me?"" Danielle asks seductively of Matthew as she lies topless on the motel bed, aware now of his confused motives. The scene plays with unbelievable ridiculousness that even the fans would have to acknowledge, until Matthew comes through and speaks on behalf of the audience; ""Why are you doing this?"" Danielle then starts to show the kind of emotional damage we would realistically respect from her; ""Isn't this what you want? To f*ck a porn-star in a cheap motel?"" Hurt, she leaves Matthew to think about his careless actions, in turn leaving us thinking this bears startling resemblance to something that could actually happen in real life.Unfortunately, this feeling doesn't last long. Strangely it is the entrance of the film's show-stealer, Timothy Olyphant, which marks the beginning of the film's decline. Olyphant's character Kelly, Danielle's former producer and charismatic sleaze is superbly acted and written, but seems like he's gate-crashing a film he doesn't really belong in. Ensuing his arrival are the much less interesting and involving (if, granted, rather humorous) aspects of the film: Danielle leaves peaceful suburbia with Kelly to resume her life of degradation, Matthew sacrifices his grades and potential scholarship to attend the Adult Film Convention to bring her back, and ends up bloodied, wanted by authorities and high on ecstasy; a state in which he must give a speech to a hall full of people on why he must get a scholarship for Moral Fiber. And of course, in true romantic comedy tradition, the speech is completely improvised, all about Danielle (who has returned out of true love) and receives heart-felt applause. The only typical cliché that wasn't used was to end the film there; it's just too bad that what followed was ridiculous, tedious and dragged on for far too long.So I suppose you could say I'm in two minds about it. In a way, the film for me was a bit of a catch 22; all the faults would not have stood out or mattered nearly as much if it hadn't opted to show potential to be a much better, more interesting movie. On the other hand, the pleasant surprises it had to offer were, along with Timothy Olyphant, by far the best things about it. I guess what it all boils down to though is this; ""The Girl Next Door"" was not a film I expect to have strong opinions about. And it sure showed me.",The Girl Next Door
117,mullermike,Kind of a homage to Risky Business but much more than that,9,13 February 2005,"I did not see this movie in theaters. I usually wait for teen films to come out on video before viewing them. I must say, the way this movie was marketed, one would figure that this flick is along the lines of such classics as Bring It On and Can't Hardly Wait. Though this movie definitely is now part of the illustrious teen film library, it runs a little bit deeper than the average adolescent flick.As the title suggest, this movie does have Risky Business written all over it. The characters (the pimp vs the adult film director) the props (glass egg vs the golden ""trophy"") as well as the music and language definitely give this film an updated twist on RB. However, it would be erroneous to write this film off as a rip-off, it just isn't afraid to show it's influence.Emile Hirsch is great as Matthew Kidman, the ambitious high school senior (who actually looks like he's in high school) with an Ivy League future. Straight and narrow, his life is spun on it's head once Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) enters the picture. Cuthbert, playing a free-spirited porn star, actually gives a rather understated performance that is sincere and sweet. Matthew's once planned out life is now lived more on the edge, and with that, he encounters some interesting characters, such as Kelly, the shady porn director, played flawlessly by Timothy Olyphant.However, as the film progresses, the movie didn't delve as deeply into Cuthbert's character as it should have. No insight into her background, how did she get to where she is right now, etc. She also takes a back seat to the growing tension between the Matthew and the sleazebag Kelly. I must say, Olyphant is great in this film. He goes from being hilarious to charming to scary in the span of about five minutes and steals almost every scene he's in. The other supporting characters are great. Chris Marquette (Eli) and Paul Dano (Klitz) are funny as Hirsch's dorky friends, and hopefully Marquette will land more roles like this. They too seem to become more adventurous once Danielle enters the picture, what an influence one person can have.So in the end, this does have a lot of the typical teen flick campiness. There are jocks, hot chicks on campus, geeks, and the movie itself has plenty of swearing, bathroom humor, slapstick, you name it. There is a sweetness to the movie, as it's amazing what a person will do when they fall in love. This movie has plenty of twists and turns, so come along for the ride and have some fun.",The Girl Next Door

121,Frequency270,The Hughes Torch,8,13 September 2004,"For those who enjoyed John Hughes teenage angst movies such as the Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles and the raunchy trilogy of American Pie, this will be right down your alley. The leads Emile Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert, Timothy Olyphant, Chris Marquette and Paul Dano carry themselves very strongly, almost to the disadvantage of the rest of the cast who become vital structurally, but otherwise completely unnoticeable. There is an occasional violent tone to this movie that clashes bizarrely with its otherwise comedic nature and the scenes are very disturbing. Additionally dream sequences are blended with real-time sequences, for occasionally comedic, sometimes freakish effect. Timothy Olyphant almost steals the show as a sociopathic porn producer who you never quite know if you want to cheer on or wish he were dead.Hirsh and Cuthbert mix quite well, blending the finding and losing of innocence with a pleasant sincerity. Chris Marquette comes across as a young John Laroquette type character from ""Night Court"", and is entertaining. Borderline on visibility, but filling in when he does, is Paul Dano. Visually and scriptwise the movie is a lot of fun throughout, and tries to avoid wading in its own sincerity too much. The 'unrated' version hardly seems to need to be unrated, and I'm not precisely sure what separates this movie from a modest R rating. A 7.5 on a 100 point scale and a flat 8 on a 10 point.Damion Crowley",The Girl Next Door
122,returning,Cleverly exaggerated,6,5 January 2005,"It's been interesting to see the reaction to this film. From what I can tell the two main criticisms are 1)that it rips off the teen-comedies of the 80s and 2) that it deals too lightly with porn-related issues. It's first important to note that films that simply rehash a tested formula can be accused of ""ripping off"" whereas a film which borrows elements but reworks them in a new and creative way, paying homage to their predecessors but taking the genre into new directions is certainly not ripping them off. It's wonderful to see high school life dealt with so intelligently while staying entertaining and fresh.I watched this with my girl-friend who is very concerned with the whole porn industry and how the actresses are treated. But she couldn't see what was so offensive about the way they were portrayed in this film. The film isn't making a statement about the porn industry, it's talking about growing up. It's hyperbole, not hypocrisy. Strange how the gray-haired critics feel obliged to take offense.3 out of 5 - Some strong elements",The Girl Next Door

124,JWBly,Timothy Olyphant shines,7,1 December 2010,"This is an enjoyable yet ultimately forgettable film. The ""boy rescues cute girl from terrible life"" plot has been done many times before, no doubt in many better ways. Emile Hirsch performs passably well with the material he is given, and the luscious Elisha Cuthbert provides plenty of eye candy that she could not show in 24. The rest of the characters are one-dimensional and barely worthy of mention. But the show belongs to Timothy Olyphant. Although he does not even appear until halfway through the film, his role makes the entire movie worth watching again. He screen presence is palpable as the ultra-cool bad boy that every man secretly wishes to be. Scruffy, chain-smoking, alternately funny, friendly then dangerous, he owns every scene in which he appears.

Elisha Cuthbert (woefully underused in 24) gets her chance to shine and is fantastic.  Drop-dead gorgeous and she can act as well.  It's a shame that for a 15 (in the UK)-rated movie we get to see so little of her amazing body.The story is fairly predictable, although the director does try to fool us now and again by including the odd scenes that turn out to be a dream or fantasy.  There is an occasional flash of violence that seems a little out of place but otherwise it's all good fun, albeit a little raunchy for the more conservatively-minded.The story reminded me just a little of 1968's The Graduate, and the excellent soundtrack ranges back to the 60s with Donovan and Thunderclap Newman, and right up to today with David Gray.",The Girl Next Door

Well, if course: the actors. I liked Elisha Cuthbert here, she had sex-appeal, probably because she played a porn-star. the camera focused extremely often at her, maybe to often. The make-up changed too fast. She must have had 5 or 6 new clothes new make-ups new hair styles, that was a little anoyng to say at least, i felt it was on fast forward. Emille Hirsch acted great too, not that he had much of a hard work to do. He played a crazy in-loved teenager, nothing mor as for Tymothy Olyphant, he was the most genuinely as Kelly, Danielle's manager.The plot was filled with cliché's, the same old jokes, smae old ending were everyone succeeded in everything. Not one scent of a drama, not one serious problem. I mean, come on, thinks can't go that smoothely in real life!

This cute little sex-kitten is the best thing to come out of Canada since Brian Adams. As for this film? It was good enough for me to take the time to comment on, so that is certainly saying something.The Girl Next Door goes against a couple of long standing norms in that it is: A)	A creative, engaging coming-of-age flick B)	A classy film about pornGranted, Elisha Cuthbert could stand in front of a camera making pouty lip-faces and giggle that cute little laugh of hers for 75 minutes and the film could gross 75 million, but this movie just inexplicably `did it' for me, no pun intended...the plot was able to stand on its own.The imagination that this film inspires: the notion that a moment of serendipity can await an unsuspecting, worthy person is what really inspired me. This movie also managed to avoid the majority of the teen romance clichés, which is certainly a good thing. I gave this one an unequivocal 10 rating: Not only did Elisha Cuthbert make this film great, but the plot was quite impressive too, as I certainly wasn't expecting much.

131,mcgill_j,An eccentric teen movie?,7,3 January 2005,"I had read the similarities between this film and ""Risky Business"" which launched Tom Cruise into stardom. I hadn't really thought about it that much, even while watching the movie as much.. Even the next day now, I still really hadn't connected it as much until I read someone pointing out very very specific instances, and I do see them now more clearly.. But, Risky Business was a product of it's time.. Whereas this movie, it doesn't seem as much to be.. oddly. Starting with the rather eccentric soundtrack, in the opening scene? Queen and David Bowie's ""Under Pressure"", this eclectic song choice fits the main character, quite well..As do some of the other musical choices, while some are of the more obvious ""soundtrack selling"" titles they all seem to make sense taken in their proper context, while most of the soundtrack seems more a throwback to 70s and 80s.The more risqué elements of ""Risky Business"" have been more or less jettisoned, although there is some topless nudity, (I refer to the UNRATED CUT on R1 DVD). Unexpectedly though, there's more of a relationship story in the film than I expected as well.The one thing in Risky Business I never really considered, would these two people stay together? While they had a fiery sexual tension.. I didn't really see a ""relationship"".Another similarity, in a nod to Risky Business is the bad guy.. who is actually given a bit more screen time. Joe Pantoliano only got to establish himself as the ""heavy"", also the friend characters (Curtis Armstrong, Bronson Pinchot) were never given much time to develop as characters in their own right.Those are not missteps, but character development was not high on the list of that film's priorities. Aside from the main character of Joel, and his lady. Even then there seemed only more growth in Joel, which remains similar in this film with the male lead getting most of the development.This film.. although a bit more ""silly"", although not going for the slapstick of American Pie, than the film I would consider its spiritual father figure.Both characters share the same problem. They both have daydreams.. but,it's not the daydreams themselves.. but their inability, even as this one in its closing moments puts it dead out there if you hadn't been paying attention, to live for the moment and not see every bad thing that COULD happen.This happens several times to Joel as he imagines scenarios, that go horribly awry.. this is acknowledged early on in this film in a scene where the main character is planning to ""ditch school"". How he sees how everything could develop, and where it could go bad. And in the end chickening out.. in the end, both characters learn to live in the moment and step up, so to speak.As for the performances, I can actually only give good marks all around. From the leads, to the eccentric friends, and the two are they, aren't they bad guys.What surprised me most was the work put into the ""bad guy"" character played by Timothy Olyphant who can be a nice and charming older brother one moment, and then a cold, calculating, and menacingly evil the next. But.. in the end, he's really not a clear bad guy.. sure he does bad things, as his interest in the film is the ""money"". He's a businessman pure and simple, and when his business is threatened, he isn't shy about letting people know.Sadly the under used parents.. mostly Timothy Bottoms, who plays the father, who I last saw doing quite the image of our Commander and Chief George Bush. But, for what's there.. the characters, are much more explored and used well... the friends are definitely caricatures but they are funny and well used. Whereas in Risky Business the friends just, almost seem to vanish later in the film, whereas this one is much more using them throughout.Even to the detriment of not showing ""The Girl"" of the title as much. The story becomes more and more about her, and trying to fix the problem he got himself into, much like in Risky Business, but gets rather.. I would say complicated, but that is the wrong word.But her character seems to disappear in the background, and it becomes more of the leading man's character to try and save her from herself, and the world she's falling into. Although she isn't on screen, she's still very much a part of the story.Special nods though to Cuthbert, Hirsch and Olyphant in their respective roles. Cutherbert who has such a sensual demeanor, while sometimes not even realizing it. Uses that to full effect, while also showing moments of vulnerability, and humor. Hirsh of course is the ""good looking"" geek guy.. Who goes from being scared to growing up by the end of the film. and learning what many of us do, sometimes you have to do the wrong thing to do the right one.Olyphant though I single special praise though.. Because he goes from such a nice and almost charming older brother, to a menacingly and slimy character with such ease.. Your initial thought would be, what a slimeball, but he turns that perception quickly on it's ear.. but then, later in the film pulls the 180 being the bad guy you thought he was the whole time.. but even in the end, he does hold respect for the kid. I think it was really a tricky performance, to make someone you shouldn't like likable, then makes you hate him.. but in the end, you still get a smile in his very small ending moment.In the end.. I liked that all of the more main characters got their moment. Their time to do something. Sometimes silly, sometimes sweet.. It definitely was not the average teen sex comedy farce I'd expected..",The Girl Next Door
132,DarioTheSweeper,Something about the porn industry.,10,8 November 2021,"Honestly, who has never seen a porn movie? What would have happened if you met an actor from these movies? I have to say very interesting and this movie tells about it.Good actors were selected for the main roles. Elisha Cuthbert and Emile Hirsch mastered their task very well. A slightly different love story is very fun and entertaining. You don't see many movies of this kind and that's why it's something special. The director got everything under one roof and the overall work is very good. If you want to know something about people like this, you can watch this movie. People like this, I mean porn actors. I have to say a very sensitive subject. On the whole, this movie is fun!To come to the conclusion I have to say that it was a very good experience and I learned more about a lot. From me the highest number of stars because I liked it very much.",The Girl Next Door
133,Weisz_Man,Funny,6,20 November 2006,"There is a point in ""The Girl Next Door - Unrated Edition' (which I received and promptly devoured, extra's and all, in one sitting) where the movie is in danger of changing in tone and focus from American Pie to Showgirls, but luckily for the movie - and viewers it recovers itself and ends in a definite teen comedy spirit.I never saw this movie in the theater so I cannot comment on what has been added to this ""unrated edition"" but there is certainly quite a lot of nudity, but nothing involving the main actors. There are some graphoc scenes at a strip club (including lap dancing) and we get shots of one of the main actors watching a porn video at home. There are some nude scenes from behind of both principal actors Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert, but as Hirsch points out on Side B of the disc (where most of the extras are located) the movie used a stand-in for those shots.I have a word of caution regarding the list of extra's on the Amazon page. One is titled a scebne specific commentary bu Hirsch and Cuthbert. What we have here though is not a commentary for the whole movie from the two stars, but rather several scenes on the flip side of the disc in which the two actors both give separate commentary.Largely (and unjustly) ignored at the box office this teen comedy starts of really well and within the first few moments had me rolling with laughter. The movie starts with a montage of sorts, we see the jocks, brains and cheerleader-types all stating, for their entry in the yearbook, what they ""will always remember."" Then there is Matt (played by Hirsch) who is pondering this question. Sure, he has had a successful academic career - as illustrated by his acceptance to Georgetown - but he really hasn't done anything memorable in his senior year of high school.That's about to change for Matt though with the arrival next door of Danielle (played by Cuthbert), who mplays a breathtaking beauty house sitting for his neighbors.Entranced by her Matt is unable to stop himself from watching Danielle undress in the window opposite his bedroom - but he is spotted. From that moment he is on a roller-coaster ride. Danielle, amused and evidently attracted to Matt, shows him the excitement of living on the edge, from running naked through the streets to moonlight skinny dipping in his school principal's pool.Just as everything seems to be going so well between Matt and Danielle, Matt is shocked when one of his best friends Eli (who is a connoisseur of porn movies and full of in-experienced sex advice) shows one of his porn movies - in which Danielle is the main star.Foolishly following some of his friends advice, the two part company and moments later the movie changes tack and takes on a decidedly darker and more serious tone as Matt becomes sucked into the shadowy world of the pornographic movie industry. Initially charming and friendly towards Matt, Danielle's producer and one-time boyfriend Kelly (played well by Timothy Olyphant) turns violent and antagonistic towards the youth who has his mind set on getting Danielle out of the industry.This all comes to boiling point when the sleazy producer drugs Matt and sets him up for a robbery.What follows is both inventive and highly amusing. How will Matt afford to get into Georgetown? What will become of Danielle? These are just some of the questions in this entertaining movie that borrows heavily and liberally from a number of the John Hughes movies of the 1980s and the American PIE movies of more recent years. The movie ends on a high note in a conclusion that is both satisfying and enjoyable.Now onto the part that most readers of this review are more interested in - the extra's. On Side A of the disc we have an okay director's commentary from director Luke Greenfield and an at times amusing and at other times fascinating trivia track.Then on Side B of the disc we have the aforementioned seven to eight scene specific commentaries from Hirsch and Cuthbert (Hirsch curiously has one more) and deleted and extended scenes with optional directors commentary. None of these scenes are of any particular value to anyone but completists or fans of the movie. They add nothing to the feature, but do have a curiosity factor to them. They also chose the better of the two endings also.Of more interest is an amusing featurette in which actor Chris Marquette (who plays Eli in the movie) poses as a porn producer and lures in all too interested men (there'e a cute blonde on the bed afterall) who get decidedly less interested (for the most part) when the girl is replaced by a big burly guy.We are also offered a stills gallery and a VERY short gag reel as well as trailers for a couple of other like minded movies in addition to one promotional trailer for several other Fox titles. There is also a trailer for THE GIRL NEXT DOOR with the subtitle 'Dirrrty,' which in reality isn't really that much of a big deal.All in all, this is a good and entertaining movie, it seems to lose its footing half way through but successfully and engagingly returns to top form before the final credits roll. This is a definite must-buy for fans of the movie and the genre and certainly great entertainment",The Girl Next Door
134,Samiellovesmovies,Enjoyable,8,14 February 2018,"I thought this was gonna be another one of those movies like American Pie, I was very very wrong. This movie shows men not to treat women like objects and to really care about a girl and love her.",The Girl Next Door
135,Confidante77,Immersing,10,21 January 2007,"Sure its got a pretty weird story that may seem like a re hash of Risky Business but don't let that put you off, it's ****ing great! When i first watched it, I was blown away, it had much more depth than I would have expected from a teen movie and you get so immersed and involved with the characters that its unbelievable.Emile Hirsch is great as the nervous nerdy, unsure of himself guy and, I don't really think I need to say this, Elisha Cuthbert is great. Doubtless a lot of guys went to see this just because of her being hot, but her performance is really great- can you imagine how hard it would be to play a cute, lovable, confused aspiring porn star? anyway, its definitely worth seeing, and don't worry if you get the so-called ""Elisha Fever"" which several guys have mentioned in their posts, its pretty normal I think. If you think its sad that some guys watch this film every day, see it for yourself and it might have the same effect on you.",The Girl Next Door

If I had to give this simply average movie a rating, I'd give it ""half R"", meaning that half the movie had guts and the other half had none.  I believe the movie was written by a schizophrenic (however you spell it).  Some days, he would be raunchy and uninhibited.  He used the great premise to his advantage.  And some days, he was a big wussy.  He wimped out and made chessy scenes seen in hundreds of other movies (c'mon pal, I saw an ecstacy trip in BAD BOYS II).Tim Olyphant was the best character, but he dried out near the end.  Elisha Cuthbert was sexy.  The Tripod (as they're called in the film) were good, too.  I just wish this film would've stayed in one direction, you know? First, the girl next door's a former porn star.  Great!  Wait, now it's about friendship.  Okay, but... porn star?  Yes?  No?  Yeah, ex-porn star and friendship.  WHAT?  Kid from the Orient?  Are you kidding?  You're not kidding.  Oh.",The Girl Next Door
137,wannasurf2,worth watching,6,1 January 2007,"Yes, this does feel like a formula 80's teen movie - as if the screenplay was shelved in 1984 and put together recently with only slight adaption. Some may criticize this, but other will revel in it. The whole time while watching the movie, I got Risky Business flashbacks. Even some of the scenes and music had that feel to it, but with a comedic feel almost...as if it was done intentionally. Naturally the movie has the stereotypes played to a T - the nerd pack, jocks, etc, but the bad guy (porn producer) was an interesting character, although this character while surely remind you of the pimp in Risky Business, no doubt...hmmm. Regardless, it is entertaining, and worth watching. Sure, it isn't a John Hughes movie, but one of the better teen movies I have seen the past couple years - or at least since 10 Things I Hate About You. The bottom line - if you are a sucker for ""another teen movie"" as I typically am, then I recommend this one.",The Girl Next Door
138,fightingamish00,Marginal thumbs down...lots of potential...not enough to recommend,5,31 January 2007,"There were times throughout this movie that I really wanted to slit my wrists. The story is choppy and inconsistent which is only noticed b/c of its lack of humor. The storyline had potential and I really wanted to like it, but in the end (which is long and drawn out btw), I just couldn't appreciate. It definitely had some good moments and Cutberth is extremely beautiful and gives a great performance throughout but that's not enough to recommend a movie. Olyphant's character was too inconsistent and wasted on his talents but he does steal just about every scene he's in. The ending is long, drawn out and really stupid and I believe every scene has some kind of song for the situation. Without giving anything away, I believe this movie could've ended 30mins. earlier at the prom without all the other stuff to worry about. It just simply became too much of a comedy of errors (in both the story and the writing) and just when you thought (or hoped in my case) that it was over...here we go again with another annoying problem. They could have done so much with this (like focused more on Cutberth's character) but focused too much on being a teen flick instead of a good movie. Cutberth's and Olyphant's talents are wasted and I can't even recommend this to teens. There were several opportunities to turn this into a movie with heart and sweetness but instead tries to be funny and fails. A true disappointment. THUMBS DOWN!!!! 5/10",The Girl Next Door
139,Towel Dude,Risky Business 2,7,11 April 2004,"Good fun, 90's version of Risky Business.   Substituting 90's porn industry for 80's call girls.  But the seamy subject matter, isn't off putting, because the smart script offers life lessons and insight that is rare in today's teenage sex comedies.    Like Cruise's film, this movie is about a likeable high school dweeb who dreams about 2 things ; getting into a prestigious college, and hooking up with hot babes.  Using RB as a blueprint, the film's arc is familiar, but still vastly entertaining. Clever, funny dialogue, energetic performances, and real sweet chemistry between Elisha and newcomer Emile.  Does it need to be emphasized again about how stunningly gorgeous Ms Cuthbert is?  Wow.  I'm in love.  Movie even uses a couple of songs that were heard on Risky Business soundtrack. Enjoy.

140,finnigan2,Wildly uneven with plot and continuity problems,3,16 April 2004,"The male lead, Cuthbert and the porno pimp, oops, I mean ""producer"", are the best things about this film. They are all likeable. However, the plot line is so implausible and has such huge holes in it that you only have to stop from time to time and ask yourself, ""how come....?"" to realize that nothing adds up. Whenever the problems become too glaring the film resorts to a little dash of T&A or blue dialogue to distract the viewer from noticing and, judging by the generally favourable reviews on this site, it worked.For me, a movie has to have some basis in reality or plausability to be truly funny. As a secondary issue, I was a little disturbed about the basic premise that a porn movie career is a valid choice for a girl supposedly only 18 or 19 years old. Not only valid but apparently a laugh riot too.",The Girl Next Door

143,arthurmauk,Just Go With It,10,5 January 2006,"The Girl Next Door isn't a riotous, laugh-out-loud comedy, à la American Pie or Road Trip (don't get me wrong, I think they are fine movies of a different genre), nor should it be treated as such when being reviewed. It's much more mature, a sweet delight of a story that has you chuckling in amusement rather than rolling on the floor guffawing. For that, I would hardly even classify it in the generic 'comedy' genre. I must admit, I did go in thinking that I'd spend two hours of my life enjoying yet another teen comedy, with an overdone plot, jokes bordering on distasteful, and up to the brim with gratuitous nudity. However, I came out with so much more.It's a classic tale of boy-meets-girl, boy falls in love with girl, boy lives happily ever after with girl. But what makes The Girl Next Door stand out from the rest is the superb cast. The casting director did a great job, placing Emile Hirsch opposite Elisha Cuthbert (both very talented young up-and-coming actors, I wish them well in luck, love and life). The pair's on-screen chemistry is undeniably electric. They portrayed Matthew and Danielle's relationship perfectly  loving and tender, yet fragile. This boy has fallen hopelessly in love for the first time, with the girl of his dreams. He has no past experience to draw on, he's terrified and confused, and he doesn't know what to do! As director Luke Greenfield pointed out in his commentary (Unrated DVD is a must-have for the hardcore fans), Emile and Elisha were chosen for their ability to act without dialogue, simply with their eyes. The subtleties in each expression brings so much more to the characters when watched closely in detail  every nervous bite of the lip, every slight mischievous arch in the eyebrow  you can tell exactly what they're thinking. Now, I've seen my fair share of movies/TV shows, and I'd be confident in saying that I have not yet seen another actor/actress able to fill those roles as perfectly and effortlessly as Emile and Elisha did. They must've poured their hearts out into these characters, bringing them to life, their romance blossoming on-screen.And how can we ignore the superb supporting cast? Timothy Olyphant and Chris Marquette's work on this movie was simply priceless. They provided the comedy and laughs, and it would be impossible to list all of their hilarious one-liners here. A lot of people claim that they made the movie, and though I disagree, I can sure see where they're coming from.And the music, oh, the music. I came of no great surprise to me to learn that Luke Greenfield writes all his projects to music. It is this unique trait that embellishes the movie with such a vivid background. From Bowie & Queen's ""Under Pressure"" opening montage to The Who's ""Baba O'Riley"" closing credits, every single song is perfect for its scene, particularly David Gray's ""This Year's Love"", mine and many other's favourite song in the soundtrack. It kicks in at the exact right moment and manages to capture everything about this innocent, pure, high school romance. Also, Paul Haslinger (second to none at composing scores) wrote some of his best work for The Girl Next Door. Simply put (again, stealing lines from the director) Haslinger is deadly with a piano. Each score enhances and fills the moment with such tension and suspense, most notably ""Peeping Matt"", when Matthew watches this gorgeous creature undressing through his window for the first time. There is an element of voyeurism and the excitement of the danger of being caught, as he watches the female movement and form unravelling with fascination and awe. He simply can't keep his eyes off her. It's a scene that many of us can connect with.This is indeed one of those movies that ought to be watched on a DVD, at night, alone, rather than on a huge screen in the cinema with others. You'll find yourself leaving the end with a bittersweet aftertaste  will I find that special someone like Danielle? Do I need to be broken out of my shell? Is the juice worth the squeeze? Sure, it is an idealist fantasy, but it's also sweet, endearing and full of heart. It's how an old-school love story ought be done. Just suspend your belief for two hours, and watch the magic happen. Hell, just go with it.",The Girl Next Door

145,dylanworkowski,Laugh & Cringy,5,24 March 2019,See I did not think this movie was good at all except is made me laugh through the whole thing and I do not know if that was the purpose but that's all I got out of it. The plot is crazy and the second half is all over the place and feels like it turns into a different movie all together. I do not take this as a serious romantic movie especially with that ending which makes no sense on how they could get away with something like that and I don't think any business man would have made that deal because it breaks laws. So overall hilarious movie but has no serious parts if you ask which brings it down and the parts that weren't funny were just cringe worthy and that about all this movie is.,The Girl Next Door
146,Killa_Cam,"Funny, Yet Forgettable",6,18 September 2004,"The movie is good or at least not bad. It could've been much better though, if not for the stupid story. It is really silly. There are a lot of dumb, but funny movies out there, but this one had potential. I mean, a high school graduate falling in love with a porn star was actually nice idea. It could've become a very romantic, inspiring movie, but the director apparently decided to emphasize the comic aspect of the picture, thus sacrificing character development & general credibility. The jokes, to tell the truth, are not hilarious either. They are likely to bring a smile up on your face & keep it throughout the movie, but you ain't gonna be laughing your head off.What saves this movie is outstanding acting! Such a wonderful performance by the cast alone makes The Girl Next Door worth watching. The on-screen chemistry between Emile Hirsch & Elisha Cuthbert is undoubtful. James Remar is charismatic as usual & Timothy Olyphant is almost perfect. The funniest role is played incredibly successfully by Chris Marquette, who at times steals the show completely.I'd like also to mention the great soundtrack, which totally suites the movie & is I think worth purchasing.In the end, this sappy comedy is likely to improve your mood & you'll probably enjoy great acting. Yet, this is not what it could be & it's far from being a mandatory entity in one's DVD or VHS collection.",The Girl Next Door
147,Moviemanic22,Very inspired,6,25 May 2016,Please do not confuse this movie for the life of porn star Stacy Valentine feature from the same year. This is mainstream comedy movie that stars Emilie Hirsh and Elisha Cuthbert. The film is about a high school student who discovers that a porn star has moved in next door to him. They become friends which leads to a serious relationship. However it is only a matter of time until her porn film producer friend bumps in to her again and attempts to come between the two. The film follows the same route as many previous love stories. Unfortunately the film doesn't shed much light on the porn industry and is neither a biography of any sort. There are many comic moments that display the humour side of the business. Towards the the second half the film ventures in to 'risky Business 1983' terrority. As a matter of fact the film almost seems like a duplicate of the 80s movie. The only difference seems that Rebecca De Mornay was a prostitute.Good light hearted fun and Timothy Olyphant is the heart of the movie. He manages to be funny in a serious way. And Cuthbert is attractive.,The Girl Next Door
148,pauloshdias,Good Movie,7,23 August 2005,"I found this a good movie. I think it has some good morale. Shows that not everything that u do tells the other's who you are.It also shows the greediness that exists out there. And it contrasts with the innocence proper from youths.Basically, it's a all family movie in which everyone would have profit watching it and would learn from it.The characterization was pretty good as well.With lots of fun and some bit of sexuality, ""The Girl Next Door"" Is a movie from which everyone should learn from and try to start seeing people from what they are and not from what they do for living.",The Girl Next Door
149,a_ngox,a light movie but qualified,8,8 May 2005,"An interesting movie I should say. It is a story about two teenagers who have different backgrounds, or I should say exactly the opposite. Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch), a 18-years old nerd-achievement-oriented, started to step up to the whole new world when Danielle (Elisha Cuthberg) came as ""the girl next door"".As a teenager movie, obviously, it contains most of the ""ingridients"" teenagers need. From the sweet romance date to the porn stars convention in Las Vegas, it has mixed pretty well as a teenager-comedy-romantic movie.Play the role of Danielle, Elisha Cuthberg has become a big plus in judging this movie. I would say she looks fantastic although her role play does not need any spectacular acting skills to perform. Overall, she can bring you to the stage that you feel you would like her. Therefore, I give her credits for that.In my opinion, The Girl Next Door worth to watch and one thing that stays in my mind after watching this movie is ""always know if the juice worth the squeeze"".",The Girl Next Door
150,bfreilly,Sex is funny... I suppose,2,2 July 2006,"I think that's what this movie was implying, but I'm not quite sure. Why? It might have something to do with the fact that this quote-unquote film was utterly lacking in anything that makes a good movie. Characters we care about? Nah. A plot that engrossed me and brought me into the world of the characters? Nope. Anything remotely funny? Nada. Zip, zero, zilch.On the other hand, it does have nudity. I'll give it that. And it can keep it, as far as I'm concerned.The Girl Next Door details the misadventures of a high school senior when he discovers that his new next-door neighbor was once... a porn star! Gasp! The horror! The kid tries to hook up with her, and his goofy friends tag along, and she brings some of her porno pals, yadda yadda yadda. The ""yadda yadda yadda"" is in there because once you understand the basic outline of this flick, you won't need to watch it. You'll know what's going to happen. You know there'll be comical sexual misunderstandings, that the geeky friends are going to try and get laid, and that an evil guy from her past is trying to get her back into the ""business"".Unless you like jokes about sex, body parts, and other wonderful things that make teenagers go ""Awesome,"" you'll probably enjoy this movie. I thought this film would be sorta like ""There's Something About Mary"", and I was right. Well, if ""TSaM"" was full of high school students, a latent lack of anything funny, and lots and lots of nudity. 'Cause everyone loves nudity... I think.",The Girl Next Door
151,Poison-River,A Pleasant Surprise,8,19 April 2006,"I really expected this to be awful, clichéd and embarrassing....BUT, this turned out to be a pleasant surprise.Whilst strictly a teen-movie(in premise at least) there is a fair amount of nudity and swearing to lift this out of the cheese-factor. Emil Hirsch is an amiable male lead, while Elisha Cuthbert looks far more beautiful here than she ever did in '24', although it's interesting that she looks better when appearing natural, than when dolled up as a porn-starlet. Timothy Olyphant adds a certain menacing charm to proceedings by apparently playing a watered-down version of the character he plays in 'Go'.All in all a pretty good little movie that deserves better than the lukewarm reviews it got upon it's release. Better suited for older teens though.",The Girl Next Door
152,ed_metal_head,Fizzles after an excellent first hour.,8,7 April 2005,"A teenaged romantic comedy with a twist, The Girl Next Door has more than just a little of Risky Business in it.Matthew (Emile Hirsh) is a senior in high school. Academically an overachiever and president of the Student Council, Matthew's greatest wish is to attend Georgetown. Without the financial means to do so, Matthew's only hope lies in winning a scholarship. Matthew, however, struggles with an empty feeling due to his lack of popularity and thus romance. When the beautiful Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) moves in next door for a short stay, she turns Matthew's world upside down.This movie works mostly because of the performances of Mr. Hirsh and Ms. Cuthbert. While the two do not do any great acting, their on screen presence and general charisma make them a joy to watch. It is perhaps, not a surprise then that the film suffers when Ms. Cuthbert is reduced to a trophy girlfriend after actually having a role in the movie. Timothy Olyphant (as Kelly the porn producer) steals the show with a delightful performance in a supporting role.The Director (Luke Greenfield) also deserves credit, mostly for the first hour, for keeping this film from being another teen movie. Besides some nice camera shots, he allows the movie to build at a nice pace and perfectly captures the feeling of the characters, especially in uncomfortable social situations.The plot for the movie is quite uneven. After such a brilliant first hour, the movie fades quickly to the point of ludicrousness before improving slightly for the end. For instance, no scene in the film is better than when the characters are at a house party and Matthew is in an uncomfortable situation. It is so well expressed that one can easily see the 'fight or flight' impulse that he faces. On the other hand, the worst scene in the movie involves a character, high on ecstasy and showing it, giving a terrible speech on 'moral fibre' and receiving a standing ovation. A further vexing moment occurred late in the movie, when a boom microphone is clearly visible at the top of the screen for several seconds. This sort of mistake from a Hollywood release is unacceptable.In the end, I have decided to recommend The Girl Next Door based solely on its opening hour. In that first hour, the film captures high school life as perfectly as I have ever seen on cinema. Disappointingly, however, the film drops off quite a bit, but those opening 60 minutes are enough to earn it a recommendation.",The Girl Next Door
153,johnnyx-2,"Too much of everything (well, except for the girl...)",6,9 March 2005,"Clearly a lot of research went into this 'ambitious' teen movie, as it packed in more unnecessary plot twists than a whole series of 90210.Perhaps it's just nostalgia, but I remember with fondness the teen movies such as 'Risky Business' or 'Can't Buy Me Love', where the premise (although equally simply - loser/lifeless guy needs some lovin') dominates the movie, instead of becoming secondary. In 'The Girl Next Door', the fact that the delicious girl is a porn star is the premise - not the plot. It's not a 'oh my god, she's a porn star!' it's a 'hey, look and see what wacky hijinks can come out of this!'. How does a porn star girlfriend help you solve your everyday teen problems? Potentially entertaining, but less than incredible.As an alternate, I would actually suggest the unheralded 'The New Guy', which takes an equally ridiculous premise, but renders it in a much more coherent, episodic fashion.Not, mind you, that this movie is a total loss (6/10). The supporting cast are great (especially the porn producer) and, good lord, she is yummy. A great soundtrack rounds it out nicely.

It isn't art in any way shape or form, but it is highly entertaining.  The fantasies of the Matthew character (played by Emile Hirsch) are hilarious, like when he first discovers that Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) is a porn star and finds her on the couch with his parents. The interaction between the best friends is a lot of fun too, especially when they go to the porn convention in Las Vegas.I really liked Elisha Cuthbert in this movie too.  I've never watched 24, so my only real exposure to her was as the boss's daughter in Old School and the ""Hot american girl who loves british accents"" in Love Actually. I'll admit that part of my liking her is because she's very very easy on the eyes, but she's able to play this role and have fun with it, which is always a plus.

I knew what kind of movie this was and I wasn't expecting a fantastic awesome movie, no problem. it's a difficult genre though, its a mix between comedy, teen-theme and romance, but I think it came out successful.They didn't spend to much time for character building, nope they dived into the story right away and I like that especially since its a 'light' movie, no need.So the story itself is believable, so realistic. The scenes are also mostly realistic but sometimes somewhat unrealistic.. I mean the pimp; is he a good guy a bad guy I don't, know I like him anyways.some lose strings are present. the biggest being the whole money for samsung thing. How is anyone else responsible for the theft expect for the lady? since when can you cash an account with only your good looks? also the speech part was cut a little short IMO. The daydream parts were pretty random and felt out of place. On a lighter note; I laughed hard at that cut scene where she(tgnd) picks up the underwear driving lol.The end was pretty unpredictable that's good for 'this kind of movie' so conclusion nice lightweight film, with decent story line and good ending.",The Girl Next Door

If you let go of any preconceptions or judgments you'll walk away from this movie feeling good and hopeful. Yeah, Danielle was a porn star, but she was also a person.

157,stuff2delete,surprisingly good,8,6 September 2004,"As far as the teen comedy genre goes, this is one of the best ones I've seen in a long time. Sure, there's the usual themes (boy meets girl, boy loses girl, losers vs football players, etc.) but somehow I didn't mind so much. There's enough of original stuff to keep the story interesting. Even the sexual references and nudity seemed more mature, more justifiable than one would normally expect. It's also a very funny movie, and in a surprisingly intelligent way. The best thing about it though, is the fact that the plot is not excruciatingly predictable. In fact I found it rather surprising.I can see why some people are put off by the middle section of the film, or by some of the plot twists. But let's face it, if you're worried about the credibility of the plot of a teen comedy, then you're just not having any fun. This ain't The Maltese Falcon, this is light viewing.

159,TheDoctorAnd,A Personal favourite of mine,10,17 February 2011,"The Girl Next Door is probably my favourite film for many reasons. Firstly, I can relate to Matthew's character. Second, there a tons of quotable lines that could be you can use, without many people knowing where you got them from, and it also highly lives up to it's ""Romantic Comedy"" status (although quite different to normal Rom Coms), with a nice twist at the ending.Matthew Kidman (played by Emile Hirsch) is in his senior year of High School. He tries to writing what he'll ""Always remember"" about High School, but quickly realises that he has nothing to write about. Later on, whilst he is taking the trash out and practising his speech for a scholarship to Georgetown, he notices a girl, Danielle (played by Elisha Cuthbert), who he instantly falls for. Later, she catches him looking at her getting undressed, to which she seemingly angrily goes round to his house to tell his parents. However, this is just the start, as she pushes him to do things ""He never thought he could do"", and gives him something to remember about High School. She, however, has a dark past, which threatens their relationship when Matthew finds out.I am giving this film an easy 10/10. You would probably struggle to find another Rom Com like this one. Some people may call this film ""Strange"", and it is a bit, I suppose, but there is definitely a sort of uniqueness to it, that separates it from films like ""Love Actually"" and ""The Holiday"".Should you watch it once? Yes. Should you watch it again? Yes. Should you watch it for a college project? If you want to.

It's not silly, as most others are, and instead, manages to catch and keep your attention throughout... From the moment Matt meets Danielle, you keep hoping they're gonna get close and that you'll be treated to the sight of her beautiful body (the face itself is awesome, I have to say)...And some events were really unpredictable, which is a marvel when it comes to this film genre...AND last but not least, Elisha Cuthbert is one of the most sexual young women to hit the screen in years! This is exactly what I wanna see in a romantic comedy - love, sex appeal and a storyline that can still give you something, not just waste your time with stupid sexual jokes and ""hilarious"" situations...Take my word for it and give this one a try. Watch and enjoy:)",The Girl Next Door
161,Jonathan Maxwell Reeves,Nice and entertaining,7,6 September 2006,I already had this movie for several months in my personal DVD collection and was waiting for a good moment to see it. A movie with Elisha Cuthbert is something you must wait for until you can't hold it anymore. Next to Mila Jovovich probably the most beautiful woman in the world. I was a bit afraid and was expecting just another teen movie to be honest. I was wrong. It was nice and entertaining. This is a movie you must see with your girlfriend or boyfriend. It will tell you about true love between two people and how far someone will go to give proof of that true love. If you watch carefully you will understand the lesson the director and the writer try to tell you. Next to Elisha Cuthbert I was surprised with the performance of Chris Marquette as Eli and Timothy Olyphant as Kelly. Marquette is very funny as the would-be porn director and whenever I saw Olyphant playing a had to think back to Michael Keaton in his earlier movies for some reason. Like I wrote I saw this movie on DVD and it has some great bonus material too. Interesting audio commentary and even a very nice trivia track. The hilarious feature called 'The Eli XXXperience' is a must see on the DVD. The movie has a bit of an open ending so when do we get 'The Girl Next Door 2 : Back In Business' ? What me concerns start writing and shooting because I want more Girl Next Door (on condition Elisha Cuthbert is in it of course),The Girl Next Door

Most of all, the characters are very well played by the cast. Timothy Olyphant as Kelly was  very likeable. Then there's Elisha Cuthbert's Danielle is great.

166,jbengel-2,Much more than Risqué Business.,8,6 November 2006,"Billed on the cover as ""American Pie meets Risky Business"" you'd expect The Girl Next Door to be one of the mindless teen comedies so ubiquitous in today's market. Typically I wouldn't have given this DVD a second look, but I like Elisha Cuthbert so I picked it up.Not that this is a film destined to change the course of cinematic history, but it IS considerably more thoughtful than most of its genre. Yes, we know before the first scene opens what's going to happen. This is not just boy-meets-girl, this is more like boy-meets-fantasy-girl and if you've ever been an 18-year-old boy, or even known one for more than 15 minutes you can see what's coming. The only question is going to be how, right? Not really. What you won't see coming is a surprisingly poignant performance by Cuthbert as the girl jaded far beyond her years. The character Danielle is a vulnerable girl guarded by the brittle hard edge of a veteran of the adult film industry. But when she meets Matthew (Emile Hirsch) who knows her only as Danielle, the house-sitting niece of his next door neighbor she lets down her guard in the hope that she can reinvent herself in this smallish town where she's an unknown.It probably would have worked too if not for the meddling influence of one of Matthew's friends, Eli (Chris Marquette). Eli, it seems, is plugged into the world of porn and reveals Danielle's secret to Matthew.At the prodding of his friends, Matthew makes his play to bed the beautiful Danielle. A gambit that is as endearingly clumsy as it is predictable. But it is here that Cuthbert renders what -- for me -- is the defining moment of the film. And she does it in one word.The word is ""Okay"", and is delivered in response to Matthew's suggestion that they get a room. In that moment, in that one word, we see Danielle pull back from Matthew and resign herself to the idea that she will never be anything more than the porn queen she was back in the big city. She sheds no tears, and she makes no sign that she knows that he's found her out until later. But in that one moment, we see the hope of the re-invention of Danielle evaporate in a way that's nearly palpable.In the real world, this would have been the end of the movie. Lucky for us, this isn't the real world and Matthew somehow manages to mature enough in the next few scenes to attempt a comeback.The details of the comeback are a source of great amusement including a break-in at the home of a big time producer, crashing the adult entertainment convention in Las Vegas, and showing up to deliver a speech to a scholarship committee after being slipped a dose of Ecstacy.Ultimately, we can see that the two will eventually sort things out and they do. Though the way they do it is something of a surprise that I'll leave for the movie to tell you about.If you liked Risky Business, The Breakfast Club, Ridgemont High, and the rest of this class, you'll like The Girl Next Door. If you LOVED those films, you might NOT like The Girl Next Door. Ardent fans of mindless comedy might find this film a little too deep for their tastes. And if you're expecting borderline soft core porn, you're going to be disappointed. While the film does contain some nudity (it would have been almost impossible for it NOT to) it's hardly chock full of gratuitous sex.In the end, Cuthbert's character is compelling (more so than even her later versions of Kim Bauer on TV's ""24"") and Hirsch is the perfect foil for her. This is a movie worth seeing -- a rare feat in modern Hollywood.",The Girl Next Door
167,guybennett-1,4-star comedy,9,20 February 2004,"I loved this movie.  The script was tight as a Drum.  ALL the performances were beautiful.  Although it has same phoney conceit as Pretty Woman - a porn star (substituted for a whore) who is NOT deeply damaged. You just smile at her nicely and like a watered flower, she blossoms.But this movie was made by people who find horny 17-year-old funny (and by God they not) NOT by people who dislike women.Smart, good natured film.

168,KevinMariblanca,Sex Education at its finest,8,4 April 2012,"The great thing about this movie is that it does not really fortifies itself with the SEX but rather it gives us a sense of what high school is like and the challenges we face during, and that moment where our parents pressure us to tell them what course and which school we want to take our college degree in. And most of all, thinking of ways to make that awesome SENIOR YEAR last. TGND highlights all these concepts in this amazing hour and a half movie. Ms.Cuthbert is mesmerizing as the famous porn star Danielle aka Athena. The lead guy also gives an amazing performance along with his two friends. All in all, I would definitely recommend this film although this film would not be in the ranks of a family film but if you want a feel good film then this is the one for you.",The Girl Next Door

Who's in this film? Anyone?... Anyone?... Bueller?... Elisha Cuthbert?  The girl from'24' who couldn't act her way out of a paper bag?  Plainly, I wasn'texpecting more than some eye candy for 2 hours.I got more than that.  So much more.  (And I will never make fun ofElisha Cuthbert again on '24' but instead focus my frustrationtowards the writers who MUST give her better stuff to do.)  Asimplausible as the situations are in this movie, the materialresonates.  I don't think that filmmakers have ever captured what itfeels like to be a guy in high school as well as this.  Ever.  I'mincluding movies like Ferris Bueller, The Breakfast Club, AmericanPie, and others when I say that.There is so much that you could talk about with this film.  I thinkthat the most amazing thing about it, though, is the way it makesyou laugh until you cry... but then seconds later... squirm withdiscomfort... or even more... with fear for the characters' existence. This film kept me so off balance that I wasn't sure if we wereapproaching its end MANY times over.It also pushes the envelope as far as sexuality in mainstreamhollywood fare -- not with its visuals -- but with its concepts.  It is asclose as hollywood can come to making a full fledged porn film.  Itdoes what porn cannot do, though.  (SPOILER) It creates a trulymeaningful sex scene with a pornstar by delaying the pleasure ofactually seeing it until the end of the 2 hours... and it does it in away that just destroys porn.So that said, if you have an open mind, go have yourself some funwith that girl next door.",The Girl Next Door
173,jind,teenager graduating learns the true meaning of respect for another person,8,11 November 2006,"When I first rented this movie, I was actually expecting to watch another usual teen comedy, but, what I wound up seeing was the 2006 version of how a boy who is graduating learns the real meaning of how to respect another person. When we first meet the young boy, he hangs out with a not so popular crowd and seems very frustrated by it. One evening while taking out the garbage, he winds up meeting his new next neighbour, ""the girl next door"" and he falls in love with her at first sight because she is physically beautiful. After he accidentally sees her without her top on, they actually wind up going out for the evening, and that is when the true meaning of a relationship starts up between them. She actually starts showing him how to have respect for a girl, and this wonderful message actually becomes the basis for the whole story. The two actually have a real chemistry together. The movie itself winds up giving out the wonderful message to the youth of today and tomorrow that if you don't respect another person, you don't know what a real relationship is. The movie itself is a real ""classic"" in my opinion for this reason and that is why I am glad to have it in my DVD collection. I would honestly consider this to be a real modern day ""cinderella story"" and I really hope to see Hollywood making more of these types of films, because honestly, these are the types of films that dreams are made of.The movie itself also has a lot of good laughs in it. If you want to do yourself a favor, either rent it for the evening or buy it to enjoy it over and over.",The Girl Next Door

175,MikieMD,Strange but appealing,8,3 February 2004,"The Girl Next Door is just simply an entertaining movie.  It's got plenty of flaws - almost every single scene of the second half of the film seems to act as the climax, and then the movie keeps going - but it's also got one of the most appealing casts I've seen in a while.  Emile Hirsh (Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys, Emperor's Club) is the central character Matthew, about to graduate from high school.  He's just plain likable.  The drop-dead gorgeous Elisha Cuthbert (Kim Bauer on 24, in a very different type of role here) is the title character, Danielle.  Matthew's two friends and one of Danielle's associates played by Tim Olyphant are particular standouts in terms of comic relief; the movie is genuinely funny.

However, way more important than that is that this is a star-making performance. She was outstanding.

This movie was one of those things. I saw that this movie was playing on TV and thought that I might as well check it out. I remember seeing commercials for the movie as a young boy, and since then I have always assumed it was just a sex comedy. I'm sure that is what almost everyone thought about the movie honestly. Let me just say one thing; the marketing for this movie really missed the boat. This movie is so much more than a sex comedy; in fact, while being both sexy and funny, I don't think that ""The Girl Next Door"" fits into that genre. It gives you such a genuinely good feeling when you watch it, it's great. It really reminds you of ""Risky Business"" when you watch it, both technically and in the plot. I have to say, however, that despite loving Risky Business, I love this movie more. Maybe it's because I'm going through a time in my life similar to this movie, but it really is incredible.

He also has a couple of friends and the three of them insist on calling themselves as 'tripod' and rightly so, as this film is held up partly because of the 'one-for-all, all-for-one' sort of friendship they exhibit. This film also tacitly touches upon the concept of true love and standing up for it when it's called for. Elisha Cuthbert exhibits a different level of grace altogether in this movie and was the sole motivator for me to watch this movie in the first place.

182,theimmortal18,I love this Movie!,9,26 June 2005,"The Girl Next Door is evil but fabulous. It's evil because it sucked me into it. I enjoyed the movie so much, i wanted to sit there in the theater and wait for it to reply. I was shocked though, because when i heard what it was about, i imagined being another stupid teen movie. I was wrong, it was a tale about romance but in the strangest events. Emile Hirsh was fun to watch cause he was the troubled teen who was graduating his senior year. He wanted fun, this year he really wanted just to get out and play and skip classes. Yet the power getting in huge trouble held him back. His friends Eli and Clizts (SP) are funny, Eli an inspiring film director and Clizts is just a sad senior who needs reassuring and soon gets some. (if you know what i mean) Elisha Cuthbert who is our lead actress who's taking care of her aunts house which of course is right next to Emile's home. He first encounters her when he peeks in on her when she was undressing. This seen made me fall on the floor and laugh until i had a straight jacket on in a soft room. She comes over making him believe she was going to tell. The father calls him down to the living room in a fashion like he was about to yell and scream making us believe she told them. Turns out, she didn't and his mother says to take out Elisha and show her around town. Sweet revenge took right here. She was terrible to him here, i won't say right now, go see it yourself. The movie plays out nicely until his friend Eli shows him Elisha in a porno he was watching. Poor Emile he was so disappointed at her. But then he totally acts like an ass and takes Elisha to a cheap hotel and pretends to do all this ridiculous stuff to give the hint that he wants sex. She totally knew what he was doing. She was just going along with it until he cracked. He did this all cause Eli told him to. Elisha was a former porno star, quiets, and soon Emile wants to you know what. About this time, our villain, our asshole comes to picture. Kelly who his Elisha's old porn director, meets Matt and knows right away, he loves her. He plays with him until Matt gets a little to involved as soon as Elisha goes back to porno with Kelly. Kelly gets angry at Matt and soon threatens him to leave her alone. Many attempts on her, she comes back to him, revealing shes done...again. Until Kelly come back as well, many funny and stupid things happen but it's wraps up at the end when Eli, Clizts, and Emile have porn stars as dates to the porn, you can pretty much guess what happens in the end. I love this movie and everything about it. Its a story about a boy who risks everything to prove to a girl she's worth more than she knows. It's great fun with with great acting and stupid jokes.

Instead, I found it to be predictable, disengenuine, and (most offensively) unfunny.I am not sure whether or not this movie was meant to be a comedy or drama, but it had way more drama than comedy. All of it, I was able to predict beforehand.This movie seemed to end about four times but it kept going. The movie lasted much longer than it should have. By the time we got to the end of the movie I didn't care anymore.The lead actor strongly resembled Fred Savage, though I can't hold that against him. He seemed to always be mugging to the camera and it really came off as annoying. Elisha Cuthbert was good, however, but that wasn't enough to salvage this.Again, the movie wasn't bad. It just wasn't good. There is nothing remarkable about this movie that would make it stand out among it's peers. It's not a great drama, it's story isn't anything special, it's not funny.

186,Etrigan,Worth the price of admission.,9,13 April 2004,"One of the key elements to making a memorable film is knowing your demographic.In the 1980's no film maker demonstrated this ability with greater savy than John Hughes. His films not only launched careers and packed in box office receipts; they also spoke to a generation and helped define a cadre of actors who, to this day, still dominate their profession.In 2004, its hard to say exactly who to consider when awarding the title of heir-apparent. `The girl next door' director, Luke Greenfield, seems to have crafted a gem that's worth the price of admission. But this relative unknown, whose previous efforts included Rob Schneiders 2001 effort, `The Animal', is also working with a strong script and well cast talent.
One of the underlying themes of `The girl next door' deals with the idea of updating school teaching material, an interesting thought given that the film itself can be considered much in the same way. The cast comment on how `Someone should update these films', while viewing an outdated sex-ed movie from the 1950's. `The girl next door' is as updated, in comparison, as its counter parts, `The Breakfast Club', `Sixteen Candles' and `Weird Science'.	 Young stars, Emile Hirsch (The Emperors Club, 2001) and Elisha Cuthbert (Old School, 2003) both give credible performances and may very well look back fondly one day on this film as a ground breaking performance in their respective careers. Timothy Olyphant (Rockstar, 2001, Dreamcatcher, 2003) is likewise, both easily hateable, yet roguishly charming (a la `Han Solo') in his role as Hirsch's tough ex-boyfriend/boss. Crafted by individuals who obviously recognize that this generation accept sex and nudity without the hang-ups of the Hughes generation, `The girl next door' speaks expertly and with a cunning tone that, while it probably won't see any Oscars, may give Greenfield the first sleeper hit of the year.

The opening montage was really good but the second Emile Hircsh stepped on screen it went down hill from there. I though Elisha looked great and did as well as she could but the story was really bad and completely unbelievable, I could forgive that if the movie was funny but it really wasn't except for a few small parts. Emile Hircsh stinks as an actor and I couldn't believe when I started to listen to the commentary that the director said he wouldn't have made the movie without him. First I don't believe that because this is a first time director and he's not going to turn down a job if he can't get a no name actor, and secondly Emile was the worst thing about the movie. I wanted to slap his character so much that when he finally got punched I cheered. I couldn't relate to him at all and I really thought he was a giant douche.

191,Uinat,Show The Daddy (How It's Done),7,6 September 2004,"Let's get something clear first  I hate teenage comedies. Why? Because they're stupid, seriously NOT funny (at all I may add) and copycatted. Basic plot for a teen comedy goes something like this ('I've got the power'): A Guy who is usually a schmock, who nobody likes and bigger boys like to play pranks with him, falls in love with A Girl of some high status or whatever. He has A Buddy (or more) who is funny but ugly as hell, whit whom The Guy advises with. Now after a few minutes of boiling, add sex, nudity, foul language, a streak of homosexual references. Let it cook for about five minutes. If that's not enough, add more sex and nudity. After that add The Idiot (who will make The Guy regret he was born) and The Man (most good-lookin' guy in school). If THAT ain't enough add more nudity. This is a recipe for a BAD teen comedyUnfortunately in the last 20 years there hasn't been a sincere teen comedy. The last good one I saw was 'The Breakfast Club' and that's well I'll be damned 20 years ago! After a series of teen comedies for retarded somebody has remembered how things used to be done in the old days and made The Girl Next Door. It doesn't have anything new to say about love or romance but it has a soul and 'a most appealing crew I saw in years' as one of my fellow IMDb colleague 'critics' wrote.Movie follows the basic teen plot: guy meets a girl, falls in love, loses the girl and spends the rest of the movie trying to win her back The point is I never saw sidekicks so live, situations more-or-less real and confusion and fantasies presented with such reality. Script is excellent and jokes (told so many times now) are somehow revived and renewed so they look fresh and inspiring. The usual teen comic relief character (AKA The Idiot) is given a 'Max Payne' personality (see the movie, you'll get it). The sidekicks are excellently written and acted, and somehow reminded me of Bill & Ted.

192,puppiemaster,"Next Years Oscars, I Think not",10,2 May 2004,"So this was yet another teen movie, but based on an adult theme,  I for one laughed out loud the whole time, I may have a mind of a 15 year old (I'm 35) so it was a very enjoyable experience.Ok so the acting and the story was not Oscar class, but it took up 112 minutes of my time and filled them very well.Not all movies are supposed to be serious and art, this was just what it set out to be, a good laugh and very entertaining.
I give this film 10/10 for just being so funny, I know its no Shawshank, Godfather, Empire Strikes Back or Matrix, but it really hit my spot",The Girl Next Door
193,mastac-1,Surprisingly Old Fashioned...,7,10 August 2004,"The recent glut of 90's gross out teen movies has just received another member into its fold. However, while the likes of Road Trip and American Pie may be welcomed with open arms and encouraging pats on the back, The Girl Next Door is more likely to be greeted with a non committal handshake and a couple of suspicious sideways glances. You see, this movie, despite its flaws (and there are plenty) manages to possess something that so many similar films lack. Namely? A heart.I will admit to not being averse to a bit of gross out humour. While such gags as those in the American Pie movies are hardly high art, they at least draw a belly laugh from the audience now and then. I went in to The Girl Next Door with the opinion that this was going to be another attempt by Hollywood to follow the now successful American Pie recipe. Throw a bunch of attractive twenty something's into a film to play characters up to ten years their juniors, add a couple of party scenes, a vaguely pop/rock soundtrack and plenty of bodily fluids. Leave to bake until a nice golden brown before serving to the viewing public. Imagine my surprise then, when I found The Girl Next Door to be more akin to some of the classic teen movies of the 1980's, in particular the early Tom Cruise vehicle Risky Business. While it never quite reaches the balance or sharpness of some of those films, it nevertheless manages to stand aloof from its more modern brethren, and dare I say it, perhaps a touch higher as well.Young Matthew Kidman (played by Emile Hirsch) is coming to the end of his High School life. He's a straight A student who aims to succeed in everything he does. Needless to say, he has also kept to the straight and narrow, and now that his High School days are coming to a close he's beginning to feel that he may have missed out on the wilder side of his youth. All this will change however when the gorgeous Danielle begins house sitting next door (24's Elisha Cuthbert). The pair spark up a relationship as the more confident and free spirited Danielle tries to help Matthew discover what he's been missing out on all these years.It is in this early portion of the film that The Girl Next Door most resembles some of its classic predecessors. The cast mesh exceedingly well together, Hirsch and Cuthbert providing stand out performances that really elevate the movie beyond its somewhat mundane early premise. Hirsch's Matthew is a wonderfully balanced character who is both intelligent, and yet occasionally astonishingly naïve. It also makes a nice change that despite his relatively buttoned down lifestyle, Matthew can hardly be described as a geek. Cuthbert puts in a wonderful turn as Danielle providing the character with a more down to earth feel than many of the similar characters in other movies, and succeeds in making the audience understand why Matthew falls for her the way he does. Also of note is Chris Marquette as Matthew's terminally horny and pornography obsessed friend Eli. It's hardly hiding any major plot twist to say that Danielle is somewhat more than she first appears. Eli's viewing habits quickly uncover the fact that she is a porn star and it's with this revelation that the movie loses its way somewhat. The plot line becomes increasingly dense and convoluted as it tries to tie together numerous plot strands and only half succeeding. The introduction of Timothy Olyphant (best known as the drug dealer Tod from Go) as Danielle's producer and ex boyfriend Kelly also proves to be both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because Olyphant was born to play these kind of laid back, cool yet sleazy types, and effortlessly manages to steal every scene he's in, a curse for almost exactly the same reason. Kelly quickly becomes one of the movie's major driving forces and his efforts to keep the two apart practically supplant the increasingly awkward romance of Danielle and Matthew. The dramatic decrease in Cuthbert's actual screen time in the movies second act only serves to hammer this fact home. At roughly an hour and forty minutes, the film is also a little long. Comedies should never really run above an hour and a half, and this one could easily have been condensed if some of the extraneous plot elements had been dropped.However, despite struggling under its own weight in the second act, director Luke Greenfield manages to pull everything together for what is ultimately a fun and satisfying conclusion. The final twist to the story is wonderful and the last scenes manage to tread that oh so fine line between cool touching sentiment and cloying mushiness.The Girl Next door is ultimately a film that aspires to loftier goals than so many of its contemporaries. It strives to tug at your heart and truly make you feel for the characters involved. That it by and large succeeds in that goal is a testament to the movie. However the fact that it loses its bottle halfway through and throws in a series of unnecessary and often distracting plot lines to try and compensate for a deficiency that quite frankly didn't exist in the first place is all the more saddening. Those waiting for a classic modern teen movie to rank up there with films like Say Anything and The Breakfast Club will unfortunately have to wait just that little bit longer.",The Girl Next Door

But the story was really illogical. And the main character is goofy,over nervous and indecisive. He keeps getting walked all over. His friends are worse and their hairstyles is the first thing you will hate about them but as the movie goes on their stupidity and other traits will make you despise them even more. The antagonist makes no sense. It is hard to care about the lead couple and their chemistry seems forced. Skip this one if you still wanna keep watching movies.",The Girl Next Door

It is exactly what I presume it set out to be - an accessible, friendly feel-good treat. And here's why: From a male point of view - such a sizable dose of Elisha Cuthbert is delightful. Her acting is very suitably sexy, lacking in depth maybe, but then that is excused by the generally simple format of the film. There are some genuinely funny moments, the comedy is very varied, as opposed to the one-level 'American Pie' toilet humour of most other films in this genre. There are some nice twists and turns, and it's all very nicely satisfying.It is definitely worth a watch, for sure.

204,Krustofski,Quite Possibly The Movie With The Most Heart...Ever,9,13 June 2005,"The Girl Next Door was a very decent movie that screened in 198-- what the hell am I kidding, I don't know crap about the 1980 version of The Girl Next Door, all I know is that for the first time in film history, there is a remake, that actually has heart. It also helps that it's pretty hilarious to boot. When an average, otherwise loser teenager starts dating the ex-porno-actress that recently moved in next door, he learns many things. One, especially, is that being a professional hump-bunny is no way to make a living, which is strange, seeing how the first half of the movie tries to get you excited with the idea of a human car living fifty feet away. I'll be truthful, this movie is, well, a teen movie. But it's also a teen movie thats actually funny, and actually has a soul, and can actually be identifiable to the audience known as: the human(s). The acting is the movie is surprisingly fantastic, the script is well-written, the humor is smart and carried out fufillingly, and the best part of this movie is that unlike thousands of family movies before it, it actually teaches teens lessons helpful through getting high school. Strange, seeing it's R rating. Overall, I like this movie. It's funny, it has a glimmer of cute romance, and it's one of my favorite films released in the 00' years. If you take out all the nudity and profanity and sex, what you got here is a full-hearted family film that everyone can enjoy. Anyone over thirteen should see this. Anyone over fifteen needs to see this. A good two hours well spent.",The Girl Next Door

206,lwaldo25,pleasantly surprised,8,25 November 2004,"As a huge fan of all that is John Hughes, it was no surprise to discover certain homages paid to its teen movie predecessors. Even in the score of the film there was the underlying beat of that Risky Business mood music (or something closely resembling it) in key scenes with Emile. In a film that could have easily turned to garbage with boobs and butts galore, the filmmakers never forgot that what we were dealing with here, is simply two kids trying to be comfortable in their own skin. They discover a balance in each other and fall head over heels. And why wouldn't they? I can't remember the last time in any recent release where two characters were able to communiccate so much through their facial expressions and eyes.So what if the premise is far-fetched. We could all pick apart the logistics of such a scenario with its ridiculous improbabilities. However, the reason we all fork over our hard earned money at the box office or in rentals or in cable subscriptions is that we want to be entertained. This movie does just that and was in no way the predictable teen farce that Hollywood usually cranks out. 7/10",The Girl Next Door
207,mattbruns15,This movie is good for healing relationships,7,10 October 2021,This is a good movie. It shows how to get back with a girlfriend if she breaks up. It teaches you that relationships are not just about sex. The guy in this movie has a friend who tells him he should have sex with her and he listens to his friend and that causes the breakup. This teaches you how thinking only about sex causes trouble. Watching them get back together is the best part. Watching this movie for the sex and nudity defeats the purpose of watching this movie. This isn't a raunchy teen movie to see naked girls and sex like the portrait of this movie makes it look like. This movie actually has a story and has a message.

You've got all your stereotypical teens in high school portrayed. They deal with real-life situations and they're not hyped over-the-top like in a lot of movies.The way that they portray sex and romance in this movie is pretty good. It's not love between two people that is unbelievable or love that just happens at first sight. I truly enjoyed the movie.

Why didn't this movie come when I was a teenager myself? If it had I would have given it a perfect ten. Now I'm not so generous, probably because I can't stand all things we've seen a hundred times in other teenage flicks.But let's begin with the good: for us boys, there's lots and lots of nice views in this movie! Elisha Cuthbert as Danielle is probably the most beautiful and sexy actresses gracing the silver screen today. Even if we don't get any frontal nudity from this future superstar, we see a bit more of Danielle's porn star friends ;-) You girls will also get your share though: Timothy Olyphant as Kelly has a rock star charisma that I think few girls will be able to resist. For girls that don't find dangerous men sexy there's always Emile Hirsch as Matt, although I don't see any star quality in him personally.The plot was quite different from what I expected, which is a good thing. I certainly like to be surprised, but that's why I got so annoyed by all the cliches that are still left. Yes, there will be standing ovations when love is declared and yes, it all ends with a magical prom night. Some of these scenes made me cringe in my seat and certainly hurt my enjoyment.

It's nice to see Elisha Cuthbert act.  Her role was quite surprising, because, honestly, I didn't think she was hot enough to convince me she was a porn star.  But more surprising was Emile Hirsch, who I genuinely enjoyed seeing as the main character.  Unlike other movies I've seen recently (THE PERFECT SCORE, to be exact), Mr. Hirsch is actually quite interesting as the main character, which only serves to make his cohorts and supporting actors more interesting.All in all, an excellent film, for what it is, a teen comedy that's not holding back from situations that any teen comedy should be gunning for.

But anyway The movie was amazing hit me with some good humor from Eli to Kelly. Timothy Olyphant played one crazy character a crazed porn producer with some real life ideas. This dude is my idol porn producer that I would shape out to be if I were involved in the porn business. But overall the movie was amazing I loved it.

It was funny and the plot was pretty good, but Elisha Cuthbert is the movie. Elisha Cuthbert deserves better then this. She was the runner up from getting the roll Mary Jane Watson in Spiderman. I would prefer her over Kirsten Dunst.The start of the movie started off perfect, it actually had potential to be a classic, but when they made Elisha Cuthbert a porn star it kind of ruined it, but it was still extremely entertaining.This movie was about a high school kid who was about to graduate and had a huge speech coming up to get into George Town if he won. Then one night he sees the girl next door(Elisha Cuthbert) hot! The effect of the hotness of Elisha Cuthbert changed this guys life. He couldn't get enough of her. He was pretty much falling in love with her. She made him do crazy things and he did them. I mean how can you not! When Elisha Cuthbert tells you to do something you do it! Then eventually they both fell in love obviously and they were good to each other and they had sex in back of a car seat. Yeah I know this isn't the main plot of the movie but watch it and you'll see for yourself, it's really entertaining. As soon as Elisha Cuthbert comes in you'll be like WOAH! Damn you Emile Hirsch you lucky bastard! The cast was actually chosen perfectly because both Elisha Cuthbert and Emile Hirsch no one really knew who they were before this movie.

221,das2003auctions,Kudos To Director Luke Greenfield!,9,25 April 2005,"For many of you with negative remarks to this film, i sense ignorance. As an independent film director such as myself, i have to compliment Luke Greenfield on his triumphant success on tackling such a difficult film. He uses symbols and cinematic ""acrobatics"" that portray the film in a fluid manner. Every shot and angle he uses, has meaning. The storyline is obviously unrealistic and far-fetched, however, the players do a fantastic job making it seem 'real'. Without a doubt, the players in this film are very talented, and i am sure they will find much success in their careers. Elisha Cuthbert and Emile Hirsch are obviously extremely attractive people, and that is always a plus to any film. The movie was written like a text-book style film; (thematic usage and time frames are appropriate), which makes sense because Luke Greenfield is a young director. The cinematographer for this film was quite smart in the way he conservatively used close shots. I truly love the art design in the movie from simple set design to the outrageous color scheme. If some of you didn't notice, there are wonderful, vibrant colors used throughout the movie. Lastly, the only weakness in this film was the ending (from the prom scene on). For me, it felt rushed. The first half of the movie is slow paced and creates great conflict. The ending had too many spikes of conflict. In a film, there should only be ONE added conflict within the last 15 minutes of the movie. In this movie there were several conflicts, (fear of getting caught at the prom, problems with shooting the porn video, and of course the close call with almost getting in trouble with the parents and principal). The ending is summed up with a montage, which in my opinion is juvenile and a weak way to tie the movie up. Once again, this is because Luke Greenfield is a young director.Thats how the cookie crumbles. Sorry to bore everyone, but i just needed to get that off my chest.",The Girl Next Door

Now, that being said, I really enjoyed this movie. It was more heartfelt, charming, and witty then I EVER would have expected from what I had seen and heard about this film. It isn't gratuitous at all in nature, and the supporting cast is very strong. Actually a good basic love story that I would watch again. Now would I like it as much as I did if Elisha wasn't in it? No. I would have still enjoyed the movie, however. Elisha is SO very hot and maybe for that reason only you would disregard my statements and it may well be horrible because perhaps I am completed booty blinded.

225,jhlurie,This movie is much more than it appears to be.,10,20 March 2004,"A surprising movie.  It's got some silliness, some convenient answers and some glossing over... but more importantly it has a soul, and that overcomes those weaknesses.Emile Hirsh plays Matthew, an overachieving ""A"" student, president of his Senior class and bound for Georgetown University and a big life as a politician down the road.  But when he tries to find a way to answer the yearbook question ""I will always remember..."", he fails miserably.  He has nothing to remember, because his life is too static.  He watches the jocks, and particularly the girls that the jocks are with, and wishes that he was enjoying this successful life of his a bit more.And, as tends to happen in movies like this, when he gets his wish, it's almost too much to handle.  A beautiful new girl, Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert), moves into the house of her vacationing Aunt next door. Danielle strips in front of her open window--with an amazed Matthew watching from HIS window--and when she turns around and catches him she immediately re-dresses and comes over to confront him in front of his parents. But instead of telling on him, she uses the excuse that she's new in town and needs someone to show her around.  Danielle drives Matthew out to a mostly deserted street, kicks him out of the car, and insists HE strip for her.Matthew does... and over the next few days finds himself increasingly involved with this mysterious girl.  For her part, Danielle seems to make it some kind of mission to loosen Matthew up, in a sequence of more and more daring ways.But for all of Danielle's bad girl ways... she essentially still seems sweet and if not exactly innocent, at least normal.  She tells Matt that she's moved away from her old life and is just looking for a new start.  But Matt's impressions of her come crashing down when his somewhat sex-obsessed friend, Eli, pulls him aside and shows him a video tape.  Matthew's mystery girl is ON the tape. Matthew's girl is a teenaged porno star.This is all just the setup--not all that deep into the film.  The REAL plot of the movie--the real heart--builds on this with how Matt deals with his new knowledge about Danielle, how Danielle deals with Matt, and what the film tries to tell us about who these people really are, as opposed to who they are expected to be.  Matt's pretty future comes crashing down around him, and Danielle's past threatens them both in the form of her former boyfriend/""producer"" Kelly (Timothy Olyphant).The film is more reminiscent of ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"" or ""Risky Business"" than more ""modern"" teen films like ""American Pie"" or even the wave of John Hughes films which came between these two.  Sex is ever-present, although the film is not explicit--with the exception of a few pairs of breasts in a strip club and some strong language and suggestion.  And the sex trades are neither panned nor lauded, although there are certainly implications that the teenaged Danielle has been exploited, and desperately needs to get out.  The moral center of the film has nothing to do with pornography though, it has much more to do with sacrifice, friendship, and the desire to better yourself.  And if it gets a bit heavy-handed near the end with some of this... it's given you enough to laugh and think about up to that point to deserve some leeway.Of particular note in this film is Elisha Cuthbert, who does surprisingly more than her fairly wooden performance as Kim on ""24"".  Danielle could have been a glossy fantasy girl, played without depth or warmth, but Cuthbert brings both in spades.  Rather than be disgusted or even just excited by Danielle and her choices, Cuthbert allows us to see what it cost her, what she's managed to regain from Matthew, and what she fears losing again. It's a deep performance which is more the actress than the script, and it doesn't hurt that she plays the sexy parts extremely well too.Also great is Chris Marquette, as Eli, who will give you quite a shock with his performance if all you know him from is his slightly sacharine role as Adam on ""Joan of Arcadia"".",The Girl Next Door
226,isecore,Make it STOP!,4,28 March 2005,"The premise is interesting, albeit kind of constructed. Boy falls in love with hot new neighbor only to discover she's a retired porn star.But what really makes this a bad movie is that IT NEVER STOPS! The producers keep introducing new plot-twists and it never ends! Just when you think that it's going to end - it doesn't. Just a new plot-twist is added to stir things around.Also, this thing tries to be a sexy teenage serious drama. It just doesn't work.It's obvious that the actors struggle with their two-dimensional parts, but the material is just too thin to make anything worthwhile. The never-ending plot-twists also makes sure to kill whatever interest the first 20 minutes of the film creates. It doesn't take long until you want it to just end, so you can go on with your own life.",The Girl Next Door

Considering the topics discussed in this movie are the basis of teenage minds these days, almost every other student at my school and other schools love this movie! It is hot, sexy, and yet is a wake up call that you don't have to be like everyone else. This is not a porn oriented movie. Sure it uses the subject of porn throughout the movie but to really make a point which is well received. Parents wouldn't understand this movie and little kids sure would not.

Little did I expect this to be the case; even my wife, who generally hates my choice of movies (I can't help it - I like nudity) loved the movie.****SLIGHT SPOILER**** The story line, to me, mimics Risky Business in its premise, but goes far beyond that movie in its comedy, depth of characters (particularly Timothy Olyphant), and especially in the surprise ending.I would say 9/10, but so as not to make my low expectations count too heavily on the upside, I'll give it a firm 8/10.",The Girl Next Door

232,sachinphanse,sweet teen love story,7,27 March 2007,"This is certainly one of the best teen love stories I have seen. All the actors played parts beautifully, especially the protagonists, Hirsch, Cuthbert and Olyphant and the movie keeps you glued to your sit till the end.This is the story of matthew(Hirsch) who doesn't know how to have fun in his life. Matthew is the college president and is about to graduate and then 'she' enters his life and changes everything. Danielle(Cuthbert) moves in into the neighbourhood of Matthew and Matthew falls for her the moment he sees her. Then he finds out that Danielle is in fact a pornstar but he is so much in love with her that he does everything that he can to get her. Will he succeed? And if he does, at what cost?One of the weird things about this movie is that Cuthbert plays a pornstar and we don't even get to see her full frontal but her sheer beauty makes up for it to an extent. Another thing this movie failed to do was that it never digs into the past life of Danielle as to how and why did she became a pornstar.All in all, I think there are more pluses to this movie than minuses. If you like teen love stories then you'll surely like this one too.",The Girl Next Door

234,plasmawhore,"Basically just an updated ""Risky Business""",10,18 March 2004,"I've never bothered to comment, but I read the last persons comments and completely disagree.  This was a very good movie.  It's basically just Risky Business, but with porn stars, and no Balki Bartocamus.  Balki needs to be in more movies.  Someone should make a movie with Balki and Alf, and maybe that girl from small wonder.  Most of the monkies that watch movies in theaters will laugh at just about anything, but I found myself laughing along with them once or twice.  The only complaint I have is that Elisha Cuthbert didn't show her boobies.  She's playing a pornstar for f**ksakes, show some nipple!  Come to think of it, I don't think there was any nudity in this movie.  That last scene should have had her doing some Bukkake. Definately worth seeing. 8/10.",The Girl Next Door
235,dempseyeo,What can I say?,3,12 January 2007,"This movie genuinely had me lost for words. I found it quite cringe worthy but hilarious at the same time. The hilarity however stemmed from the sheer unbelievability and utter stupidity of the various twists and turns the script took. If you completely suspend your sense of disbelief and you manage to ignore the irritating lack of chemistry between the two leads I suppose this movie could be an enjoyable romp. Perhaps for teenage boys in order that they can indulge in pubescent fantasy, which is what this movie basically is. Having said all this I could hardly stop laughing as the credits rolled, although maybe not for the reasons the director intended....",The Girl Next Door
236,DogbertIncarnate,Shockingly Good,10,24 February 2004,"Just saw ""The Girl Next Door"" tonight, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  The trailers made it look like a real teen flick, in the style of American Pie or Porkys or something, but that's not the way it came out. The acting was right on in every scene.  Even most of the secondary characters were just right.  The characters who really stood out were some of the secondary ones, like the main character's best friends and Danielle's producer.  The music fits great, and the movie twists in some good surprises.  My prognosis is that this movie is being marketed to the wrong audience ala ""The Rules of Attraction"" and that if it fails it's because it is being advertised to teen moviegoers, not older romantic comedy watchers.",The Girl Next Door

It had many hilarious moments, the sad moments were believable and not just stupid. I was also expecting more nudity but it was quiet mild, the sexual content is what you have to worry about. Emile Hirsh was damn good and Paul Dano as Klitz was great. The stunning Elisha Cuthbert was awesome, I swear her smile could light up a room a thousand feet underground. All around The Girl Next Door is a great teen comedy, the director stepped up about fifty stairs from The Animal. This movie in my opinion makes American Pie look like a fly and The Girl Next Door the spider. This is a movie I could watch again and again, the soundtrack was also great. This movie is up there in my opinion with Animal House and Fast Time at Ridgemont High.",The Girl Next Door

This is what this movie left me. Also i like to add the leading actress show me a different face. in 24 (TV series) i felt like she is stuffing the show.

Matthew finds the girl next door irresistible and falls in love with her. But to his dismay, finds out that she used to be a porn star. When he finds out, he freaks out and she decides to leave him and take up her old job again. He realizes that he will do anything for her and sets out on a quest to get her back. But unfortunately, her ""manager,"" Kelly(Olyphant)stands in his way. Through all the obstacles, Matthew still wants her back. If you are looking for a cheesy teen sex comedy along the lines of American Pie or Not Another Teen Moive, look elsewhere. While still involving sex(come on, the movie is about pornstars), it is also about the love he feels for Danielle(Cuthbert).",The Girl Next Door

To be honest I was very unsure about seeing The Girl Next Door, but now I'm glad I saw the film.The VERY beautiful Elisha Cuthburt plays Danielle, a former porn star who left the industry and wants a normal life. I found her very convincing in this role and I couldn't take my eyes off her. Emile Hirsch plays Matthew who is infatuated with Danielle when she moves in next door to him.I didn't find it overly funny, but did find myself glued to the screen dying to find out how it ends and how the characters end up because I loved the story.This was also the best I've seen Timothy Olyphant act.I'm giving The Girl Next Door 8 out of 10",The Girl Next Door

Ignore any preconceived ideas of what this film is about (the trailers etc are very misleading) and go in with an open mind and hopefully you'll see what i mean. Yes there are some very stupid scenes in the film but they are few and far between, and most of the humor comes from believable exchanges between the characters. But i hardly even see this film as a comedy, because underneath that Matt (Emile Hirsch) and Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) share a love that is more real and honest than any i have seen before. The characters seem to truly be in love, rather than just actors playing a role. (A scene that really shows this is the emotion shown by Danielle when Matt asks her to prom). In addition to the actors remarkable performances (another stand out one being Timothy Olyphant in the role of a porn producer) there is also a very strong script, which manages (for the most part) to be genuinely funny while still seeming real and passionate.Finally the soundtrack is outstanding providing brilliant songs that are perfect for the scene throughout.Overall i give this film 10 out of 10, and highly recommend you go and see it, just remember to keep an open mind.",The Girl Next Door

Even though the storyline is a but unbelieveable but it could happen in the world today. But this flick is very good. Its got smart dialogue, and overall a very good script. The acting i thought was pretty good for some unknown casting. I always hated how in teen comedy movies, the characters in highschool were played by people in their mid 20's and looked nothing like regular high school kids. But in this movie, the high school kids look pretty realistic to real life. Of course like any other movie it has its faults. Just when u thought the movie was ending, something always occured to make the story last longer. It wasn't a bad thing but it happen a couple times. Overall it was a very entertaing flick that i would see again. It's probably one of the best movies of the year that will of course be under rated. 9/10",The Girl Next Door

I like how all the characters are portrayed and in all honestly I think the film probably reaches its potential here and is as good as it can be for this story.

At times it could be quite raunchy but that is very small detail to the movie. The tagline misleads you also, (He never saw her coming, but all his friends had). It makes you think it is going to be very risky, but it is not. Elisha Cuthbert and Emile Hirsh are to wonderful actors and between them had great chemistry.

I came out of the theatre feeling annoyed and extremely uninspired. The themes in this movie were incredibly superficial - what about the ""I'm so ashamed to be a porn-star"" theme - all I have to say about this is ""what!?!""

Also, the main characters are not developed enough, especially the girl herself, who becomes a comedy sidekick as the film goes on. But on the upside the thing that makes this film worth watching is miss Cuthbert looking beautiful as always.

As she stays at her aunt's house, she meets her next door neighbor after he spies on her undressing. I think a lot of guys will be able to relate to Emile Hirsch's character--a young guy who is trying so hard to break out of his shell. Along comes Elisha who is more worldly and adventurous and who actually likes him. He'd follow this girl anywhere and not one of us could blame him for girls like this rarely come along in life.The plot is somewhat predictable but the movie has enough funny, quirky and memorable characters that you will enjoy it anyway. There is one very memorable kiss which takes place at a party, while David Gray's ""This Years Love"" plays in the background. This same song plays again at the end when they are in the limo, but interestingly enough the song is not included on the movie soundtrack CD??? For guys like myself who are a little older, the movie represents a time in life when anything is possible and within reach if you just have that unreachable,beautiful woman by your side. Thing is, most young guys never believe they could get a girl like Elisha. So the movie is about much more than a porno star moving next door. Its about taking risks, putting your heart out there, reaching for what you want even though it appears unreachable. And finally, God, is Elisha Cuthbert just unreal!!!",The Girl Next Door

One fine day, he saw a absolutely gorgeous neighbour (Elisha) who popped in suddenly to next-door and do some striping act for him. Consequences lead him to her and then story moved fwd showcasing today's high school life, beginning and breaking of emotions, teen friendship and how easily teen can be influenced. I am not going to tell you the story or plot as I just loved the naturalness in it and though it definitely not the unique one, it certainly more thrilling to get to see it without any expectation or information.Director Luke Greenfield has done good job and developed characters effectively. Especially Emile and Elisha. Both have good talent and will heading for good future. Elisha has some resemblance with Natalie Portman especially the way she smiles but will sure make niche for herself soon. All support cast has done some good job as well especially Timothy Olyphant who played porn movie producer.I definitely recommend the movie as must watch especially for people who love simple movies with real emotions though sometimes become awkward to watch but you enjoy them for their true portrayal.

But for people with some maturity, this movie is a real undiscovered gem.  And while it definitely has a few teen-aged fantasy moments, it also portrays the young leads very truthfully in terms of the awkwardness of that age.  It's not just some mindless, stupid teen comedy like American Pie; it actually has respect for its characters and cares about them, and portrays their emotional struggles quite truthfully.

I was fortunate enough to see it a couple of weeks ago at a sneak preview, and I was surprised at how much better it was than I had originally anticipated.  The initial marketing, to me, did not do the content of the film justice.  I expected a raunchy teen comedy along the lines of American Pie, Road Trip, or Eurotrip, but The Girl Next Door had a lot more heart and concern for the characters than any of those other films.
Granted, it has its weak moments - I WISH someone like Danielle would move in next door and instantly be drawn to me like she was with Matt - but no one's claiming this will be an Oscar contender - and it doesn't try to be. It is a sweet story showing how a worldly-experienced, yet not-quite confident young woman brings a sort-of sheltered, naive young man out of his shell, with both of them benefiting from things they learn from each other.I hope this movie has good word-of-mouth appeal for audiences, since it does have a good cast, a good soundtrack, and a cheesy-but-sweet story.

The story revolves around some loser who has an ex-pornstar move in next door. He's a real loser but she treats him nice and shows him the 'cool life.' He screws up with her but does everything he can to get her back, including drive across the country in a few hours, and somehow entering an adult film festival with his two 17 year old friends as well. Not only that, but he was in charge of 25 thousand bucks for his school and he manages to lose it in a completely unrealistic and stupid way.In the end, they film a porno with two porn stars in school at the same time of the prom. Then a porn director convinces the main character's parents and his principal that he is actually a teacher at the kid's school (gee, how'd he convince the principal?) and tries to screw the main character over. Cue the crappy ending, main character says a cool line about how he's just 'chillin' or some such bullcrap, and the movie's over.The only redeeming quality in the movie was his best friend Eli, and how funny he was. But that's it. Horrible movie.",The Girl Next Door
264,burnit212,Not My Fantasy,5,15 July 2006,"Another cheesy, misguided, misogynistic so called teen fantasy movie about nothing. What starts out as an intriguing premise, quickly turns into a downward spiral of bad plotting when they actually remove the love interest from the storyline half way through the movie and turn the film into a conflict between an innocent kid and some bad porn producers. Huh? It would've been a whole lot better if they kept the GIRL involved. What kind of romantic comedy loses track of one of the love interests for 20 minutes? The only saving grace of any of it is Timothy Olyphant's wry and funny portrayal of a shrewd business man in the wrong business.",The Girl Next Door

Hollywood using another movie to try and justify all the sex and profanity it likes to push off on the American public and call it art.  Instead of portraying the porn industry and it leaders as the sleeze balls they are who pray on young women, it makes them out to look like honorable people with a heart for others. Take out the nudity, the profanity, and change the scenario around a little and this could have been a really good movie.  I would hope parents will keep their teenagers away from this movie and send a message to Hollywood.  The most popular movies ever made that grossed the most income were not movies of this type.

269,deion95,Elisha and much more,6,6 September 2004,"""The Girl Next Door"" (spoilers ahead) is a romantic comedy, marked by the relationship between Matt (Emile Hirsch) and Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert). ""The neighbor"" is the motor of the film, the one that move the rest of the characters, although soon the tape is centered more around the problems that Matt has to undergo to reconquer Danielle and ultimately save his professional future.During the first part the film gives the expected, following one another typical scenes of the teen cinema: parties in luxury apartments, boy running naked along the street after being deceived...Everything changes when Kelly (Timothy Olyphant, brilliant in this movie), Danielle's producer, appears to get her back to her beginnings, a porn star. The moments of humor increase considerably with him, although at the same time the tone of the tape gets more serious. That gives the film a welcome touch of drama that often lacks in this genre.The last third of the film is all a succession of frenetic scenes headed towards the typical happy ending, although it comes with a surprise touch.All in all, a refreshing movie worth the view. It's funny, the play develops quite smoothly and of course Elisha is delightful from start to finish.",The Girl Next Door
270,SternMystic,Slap on the back funny,7,12 April 2004,"Go with no expectations and your reward shall be lots of fun. ""The Girl Next Door"" is a ""fall off your seat laughing"" entertainer, if you manage to get in the jolly mood by the time film starts. Nothing like the ad for movie tickets online with the babe in third row to get ya started. And when its not jolly, the sexy, taunting and witty looking Elisha is there to cover for the movie. Why, I think I spent my time on show laughing my guts out and trying to get enough of Danielle. The plot, logic and sequence/flow may leave much, nay a lot to be desired but there's no denying this movie is one fun experience. I admit I had a great partner sitting 2 seats beside me and we took turns spraying the hall with our cackles. All in all, what can I say but, Its a little Funny :) Go watch it while there's still a full hall to roar with. 7/10",The Girl Next Door
271,m_stp_tmp,pure love is more important than everything,10,7 August 2009,teenagers are certainly interested in this type of film that shows pure love can conquest on sexual aptitude and emphasizes on this sentence that love is more complicated that it seems and no matter who is in one side of love he or she can be attracted by whom he or she loves. this film shows that beauty and just sex are not necessary for love they are just tools to join your spirit to your minion and every love is base on these will definitely break. if you like romance film i suggest you not to miss this movie because it can impress you in many ways. it's highlighted to go with someone you like and don't be shy to express your love. you can extract from this movie that faithful love can restrain from unnecessary affair with someone else (you know what i mean).,The Girl Next Door
272,tsfogg,Pretty Woman -- but not as Sleazy,10,25 August 2004,"I remember when I watched ""Pretty Woman"" for the first time. I was appalled at how everyone loved Richard Gere and how it was touted as the greatest romantic comedy of all time. I seemed to be the only person who was creeped out by the fact that Gere was only into Julia's character for the sex! He was paying her for sex and dressing her up to make her presentable! At the end, I half expected him to say, ""sorry, I have to go home to my wife in New York now."" THAT would have been an interesting story.Enter ""The Girl Next Door."" Very similar storyline except our hero, Matt, is blissfully unaware of Danielle's past. He falls for her because of who she is. It's when he finds out she's a porn star that things start to crumble. Then she goes back to it, but Matt chases after and tells her ""you're better than this.""This story of love, grace, jealousy and forgiveness reminds me a lot of the story of Gomer from the Bible (in the book of Hosea, for those interested -- tiny little book at back of the Old Testament). It was story about love. It has teen comedy elements, but it's real and raw at times that help transcend the genre that belongs to American Pie, Porky's and the like.",The Girl Next Door
273,dollie-man,The most underrated movie of all time!,10,29 June 2011,"I first saw this movie in the summer of 2007 and to say I was amazed is an understatement! When the movie was originally released I wasn't particularly interested as I felt that it was just another teen movie (excuse the pun) and I wasn't thrilled by the trailer or tag-line as I thought it made the movie sound dirty and cliché ridden.Then I watched it... and watched it again, and again and again... I immediately fell in love with this movie (and the beautiful Elisha Cuthbert) and couldn't stop thinking about it for a week! The lead actors are sweet and believable and the soundtrack is perfect.This is a perfect example of the phrase ""don't judge a book by its cover"" and I would recommend this film to anybody. The storyline is very sweet and sincere with a fair amount of comedy thrown in the mix.Every actor plays a perfect part in this movie. Emile Hirsch plays the perfect innocent straight A over-achiever and Elisha Cuthbert is very sweet and extremely likable and doesn't play the stereotypical ""girl next door"". Timothy Olyphant plays the perfect supporting role who is likable as well as coming across as the kind of guy you don't want to mess with! This is one of my favourite movies of all time just for its pure entertainment and feel factor. It is a very sweet love story with genuine comedy sprinkled on top of it. I don't expect people to share the same views as me about this film but I would recommend giving it a go and not judging it before you watch it!",The Girl Next Door
274,thedonut2,Sexy and edgy – worth seeing,8,21 February 2004,"I was shocked when my wife agreed to go see the sneak preview with me last night, and I anticipated seeing a teenie-bopper sex flick with lots of nudity, poor acting and a bad plot.  I was very pleasantly surprised that The Girl Next Door had such a funny, sexy edge that had us leaving the theater smiling and excited.Elisha Cuthbert (you may know her as Kim Bauer on Fox TV’s “24” series) plays Danielle who is a porn star (aka “Athena”), and she stole the entire show by showing off her near-flawless physical features -- even my wife said she looked amazing! But she can act as well, adding some decent depth to the movie, and the chemistry between Danielle and Matthew (Emile Hirch) grew from an innocent boy’s infatuation to self-sacrificing love.Why did they release a sneak preview three weeks early?  My guess is to help target the female audience.  The male audience is easy to capture here, and the theater had a few singleton males to prove the point.  But there were plenty of females in the audience as well, and men and women alike seemed to laugh at the funny parts.Direction?  Again, surprisingly good for relative newcomer Luke Greenfield. Production-wise, Girl was good.  If I had to complain about anything it would be the editing – not that film editor Livolsi did a poor technical job (I actually love his works) -- but that the decisions of WHAT to cut got a bit sloppy at toward the end of the film.  Everything was moving along wonderfully…. we’re laughing, laughing, ohh! sexy, laughing, movement, movement… and then there were some dead spots. There were a few scenes that perhaps could have been cut in their entirety without any adverse affect on the plot.  Show ‘em on the Deleted Scenes on the DVD!While driving back from the theater, I remarked that the movie somehow felt unique but that I couldn't put my finger on it.  My wife said that it had an American Pie-type humor with all of the innocence of the high school boys trying to get some girls.  I thought that the movie was a good erotic-comedy-romance, with a well-deserved R-rating for some drug use and brief nudity (but not of Elisha Cuthbert) and strong sexual content. Here, the term “strong sexual content” is right on because it really couldn’t get much stronger without being an outright NC-17.  Had the sexiest scenes (and there were plenty) had nudity in them, it would have gone way beyond an R rating!  As it was, it was tastefully done but still highly erotic.Highly recommended.",The Girl Next Door

Sure there are a few changes: the prostitute is now a porn star and the pimp is now a porn producer, but this film screams RISKY BUSINESS the whole way through.  I probably laughed harder and more frequently during this film, but RISKY BUSINESS didn't exactly resort to any cheap gags (i.e. horny high school boys at a porn convention is Las Vegas) to get its laughs.  However, this movies definitely worth seeing for the beautiful Elisha Cuthbert (who should have had more screen time) alone.  But you'll be pleasantly surprised to find some decent performances, plenty of laughs, and no gross-out humor in an overall fine comedy with some heart to boot.",The Girl Next Door
276,ZakkWyldesSon,Review Of This movie(*spoilers),4,14 April 2004,"Before i begin my review, i just want to say that I haven't seen a movie i hated in a long time. I am hard to please so i try to see the best films possible because i am a movie buff. When i saw the girl next door i was not expecting the Godfather, or Gladiator, but something interesting and funny...like Old School or American Pie. After watching this insight was shattered. I am not trying to start a fight with anyone, but THIS MOVIE SUCKED!!!! The plot was unbelievably dumb, and it seemed like it kept dragging on and on. It gets really stupid when at the end you find out they made a ""sex"" ed video. Was that supposed to be funny? And the movie was supposed to be about a porn star that moves next door to a high school nerd, and half way through the movie, she is basically forgotten, because the lil annoying kid gets in trouble with her manager, who was also extremely annoying. This is the worst movie of 2004, and should be on the imdb bottom 100. Oh yeah that kid is not tom cruise so he should stop trying to be. this movie is a sucky version of risky business. 3/10",The Girl Next Door
277,JoshRoessler,"Perfect, In Its Way",9,22 March 2004,"Don't believe the naysayers.  The Girl Next Door is a very good teen sex comedy/coming of age movie.  It doesn't exactly transcend this, but so what--it isn't trying to.I guess the closest movie comparison I can make to this is Risky Business, but--though I haven't seen that movie in years--I felt like there was a much stronger emotional core to this movie than Tom Cruise's first big break.Emile Hirsch, as Matt, and Elisha Cuthbert, as Danielle, are both appealing leads in this film, both visually and emotionally.  They come across as likable and real, not cardboard cutouts of the ""bad girl"" or the ""overachiever"" that we're used to seeing in movies of this sort.  Those moments exist, but they're there for comedy as much as anything else. What really surprised me was that I could actually imagine these two people falling for each other ... though, I suppose I should say the surprise was more that I could see why Danielle might fall for Matt.  As played here, he's a genuinely good guy who doesn't know amazing he really is.  There's a quiet scene where he's explaining to Danielle how ""we"" raised money to bring a brilliant Cambodian student to study in America.  She asks, ""Who's we?"", and when Matt answers that it was basically him, there's a shrug and a kind of sense that he sees it as no big deal--wouldn't anyone have raised the money to help?  It's subtle and beautifully done.The rest of the cast shines as well; there are no weak links.  Tim Olyphant, as Danielle's producer, is at turns both cool and sleazy as hell, and both fit his character like a rhinestone glove.  He has some hilarious moments here, and takes full advantage of them.  Paul Dano, as Klitz, is probably given the least to do, but he plays the reluctant, geeky friend extremely well, and the scene where he finally cuts loose is priceless.  James Remar does a good job of looking and acting like Hugh Hefner as he plays Tim Olyphant's old partner.  And finally, Chris Marquette's Eli is a work of genius.  He's The Girl Next Door's Jack Black, Jason Lee and Vince Vaughan (think Trent from Swingers) rolled into one and then reverse-aged to a high school student so that his presence doesn't seem completely out of place. His lines are some of the funniest and most outrageous in the movie, and he delivers them with spot-on accuracy.Please don't dismiss this movie as simply another teen sex comedy.  It's at least as funny as the American Pie movies (without having to resort to gross out humor as the linchpin of the movie), and it has ten times the heart and soul.",The Girl Next Door
278,nbpatel,best coming-of-age flick since 'Risky Business',10,11 April 2004,"[three caveats before i begin: (1) i'm a guy whose background is eerily similar to Emile Hirsch's, before Elisha Cuthbert enters the scene. (2) beyond the romance and ultimate message of the film, women may be offended by the sexuality and preponderance of porn culture. (3) some suspension of disbelief, as with virtually any Hollywood movie, is required to thoroughly appreciate this film.]this film is superb.  i haven't seen a male coming-of-age flick of this quality since Tom Cruise's 'Risky Business'.  that's saying a lot.the box office figures and reviews so far probably don't match this opinion, but for those of you, particular young heterosexual male viewers, who can relate to the overachieving, A+, unpopular, prestigious college-bound kid, who secretly hopes to experience wild and crazy things, but never actually doing so...this flick will strike a chord.verdict: 10/10.",The Girl Next Door

I own the DVD and have watched it more than 10 times, at the very least. What I like about this movie is the fact that most of the plots we take for granted are taken to new heights here. ""Boo!"" to all of you folks who hated it, but I only assume you were expecting to see a PREDICTABLE movie. It steps out-of-the-box with the intricate design of each of the characters, with their inclusion only deepening the plot. The normal twists you find in a regular teen romance movie are finally SECONDARY to the main character's life! He falls and GETS the girl after the first 20 minutes of the movie... and THANK GOD for that. It tweaked my interests from the very start, because you see GETTING the girl isn't as easy as KEEPING her!! Notice at the end of the film, the way he ""accidentally"" introduces each of the characters to be who they really turn out to be (for HIM) in the end... i.e. Kelly as the Student Adviser. All the old plots and story lines are thrown out of the window for this one. FINALLY! Our generation is old enough to digest some MEAT! Provoke us! We DESERVE our 8 bucks worth.

280,get_to_the_choppa,Comedy + Drama + Romance = Ultimate Teen Movie,7,13 April 2004,"First off, this film was surprisingly better than i expected, obviously when compared with other teen comedies... why does 'American Pie' come to mind? I did see the trailer before watching the movie because i was rather intrigued with the plot (i also liked the imdb tagline 'he never saw her coming... but all his friends had', genius!). Anyway, to get to the point, the trailer made me chuckle, however, i was expecting the same result as 'American Pie 2'... where the only scenes that were remotely funny made up the trailer. In the end, this wasn't the case and for that alone, the movie does not deserve as much criticism as it has received.The only flaw to the movie i can think of is that Elisha Cuthbert far is too beautiful to be a pornstar but her evident ability to act made the part that bit more believable together with the apparent perception of chemistry between the two leading roles (Hirsch & Cuthbert). Whilst they managed to uphold the romantic and dramatic side of the movie, the inclusion of side characters, most notably Eli (Marquette) and Kelly (Olyphant), brought out a major chunk of the comic influence that had me and others around me laughing non-stop from start to finish. Even the smaller roles (e.g. Samnang) were fully justified by the response they receive rather than the part they play in the development of the storyline.The overall ending was not as predictable as first thought, with the exception of the two main characters winding up together... which can be forgiven as otherwise the first 1hr 30 of the movie would have been completely pointless. There was 1 plot line and for those who thought otherwise, all i can say is you must have been confusing 'The Girl Next Door' with the hotdog tell you to go to the lobby before the movie started along with all the other needless trailers. If there was anything to be upset about it was people laughing at jokes from the trailer... i've never understood why people do that, pretending as though they've never heard the joke before. But i digress to the point of saying that all reviews are merely subjective and we can all expect that this movie is not going to win any oscar's but if i were to pick a teen movie for someone in need of a laugh, this would be without a doubt my choice.",The Girl Next Door
281,drcable351,Not bad...,7,4 August 2006,"Initially, I was simply lost in the world of late night pay television, and stumbled across this just as it started. After reading the description; (plot summary on the interactive program guide); I figured that this would be just the sleeping pill I needed to go to sleep with. Thankfully enough, I was wrong. As others have mentioned, this film pays homage to Risky Business, but in its own quirky way. Emile Hirsch simply comes across as a very likable high school kid who's never taken any kind of risk, has always had his life planned out, has his future all lined up... Until SHE moves in next door. Elisha Cuthberts' character starts out promising, but falls flat. There isn't enough development into her back-story, (aside from one quick reference to her high school days), no real telling of her story overall. Which isn't to say her performance was flat, it was well above par, and a whole different direction from the character she played on ""24"". Timothy Olyphant is perfect. He has enough depth in his character to make up for any other shortcomings this film suffers from. Overall, this is a mostly harmless film, that will leave the viewer with a smile, and maybe a chuckle or two.

Then I was even more surprised after having watched it, and realizing how amazing terrible the film was.There were jokes, here and there, that were hilarious. I don't 'remember' any of them, but I'm pretty sure there were. Other than those few jokes, everything else was just braindead.For a subject that's largely portioned much more gloomy and dark, I at least give this film credit for making a semi-serious comedy out of it. It's unfortunate that they 'tried' to maintain a level of gloominess and darkness, because that was probably the worst part about this film. Had they simply made a straight-forward comedy, I might've enjoyed more (more Elisha Cuthbert would've also worked).The 'evil guy', whose name I don't remember but could easily check using this website I'm on though I'm too lazy to, was a great character nonetheless. Along with the 'friends', they were great as well. The lead actor though... that guy... annoyed the flipping balony out of me.

285,roberts-journalist,Rotten to its core,3,23 January 2013,"Let me start by saying that I've never seen a movie so shameful and morally compromised as ""The Girl Next Door"" in my life.To make a good teen-comedy about a sensible subject - such as the wild hormones of American teens - , you must detach yourself from everything that might be perceived as vulgar or rude or nasty and come up with some ""sweetnes"" to make the movie more innocent and honest in they eyes of the public. That's one thing this rookie, Luke Greenfield (who had previously directed the dumb feature called ""The Animal"", with Rob Scheider as lead actor), did not understand. Even a teen-comedy has to be more than just girls, tits, sex and porn-stars. I'd like to think that there is a deeper meaning hidden somewhere between those f-words. But, never mind that! I can live with the fact that this movie simply doesn't care to educate people. However, I can't and won't tolerate it's limited moral horizons. Because this so-called ""mild & sweet teen comedy"" deliberately delivers potentially harmful messages to its audience. And does that time and time again.Imagine that a cute teenager with porn-star backgrounds is portrayed in this movie like a dream-girl (true, there is nothing cooler than having a girlfriend who f...s other guys for a living). An Asian student (or geek) from Cambodgia is presented as a sex object (lots and lots of references to sodomy). And there is more. We are made to believe that the adult films industry is not that bad as you'd might think (strangely, the parents even applaud their son, Matthew, for making a porn film, because ""this could really sell""). And let's not forget the biggest boss in the porn world, a guy named Hugo Posh (James Remar), who's actually a good person once you get to know him. Is it just me, or there is something missing here? Since when do we promote porn in teen-comedies?All in all, if you want some nasty jokes, some tits and some crude remarks, then you'll get your share with this movie. But if you want wit and style, avoid it. Because, even with pretty decent acting from Emille Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert (this girl has sex appeal all right!) and the talented Timothy Olyphant (you may know him from HBO's TV Series Deadwood), The Girl Next Door is one big fat lie.",The Girl Next Door
286,pkeevers,"Three guys, a girl and a golden penis",9,6 January 2005,"The Girl Next Door arrived in Australia with little fanfare or advertising, largely due to its tepid response in the US. 'Girl' pitched in the trailer as a distant American Pie cousin meets Risky Business ('outrageous' incidents, nudity and 'hot chicks'), actually surpasses those film to deliver what has to be one of more entertaining 'teen' flicks of recent years. This is not to say that this movie is a revelation in film making. The clichéd characters abound (uncool yet not gremlin-esquire lead, geeky friends, oblivious parents, the cool crowd) and the film follows a not entirely road to a happy ending, yet the journey is made satisfying by Emile Hirsch and Cuthbert's likable leads. Cuthbert in particular lends an interesting touch to her lead, she admirably conveys a young woman trapped between two worlds struggling to find her identity without being known as 'the chick from that porno'. Her early scenes with Hirsch set up a great coming of age storyline without resorting to some far fetched hi-jinx to impress. During the middle third of this film (the introduction of Olyphant's porn producer character) the dynamic shifts from romantic comedy to comedy/drama, throwing you into some (albeit glossed over) realities of the porn industry. Hirsch becomes a more admirable lead during the later parts of the film as he comes to terms with his 'moral fiber'. For a sex comedy closing in on two hours this film should drag in its last hurdles, and its 'climax' does feel to be pushing the boundaries of reality, but with competent leads and one of the best soundtrack's from a genre film of this type in years (Filter, David Gray, David Bowie, Echo & The Bunnymen) makes this Girl worth sticking around for.",The Girl Next Door

Even though the plot as a whole is kinda cliched and predictable, it is still up-to-scratch to convey meaningful messages to audience like the sacrifice for loved ones when 'the juice is worth the squeeze' or the importance of having an eventful and wildly unforgettable high school years. Besides, the way the main characters resolved a series of continuous troubles is sublimely brilliant, in spite of some illogical trivia like the crime report scene (not going in details due to the spoilers-free status) or the quick mind-changing moments of the characters.
Finally, the performance of Elisha Cuthbert was remarkably well-acted as she vibrantly shows the personality of both a former porn star - seductive and easy-going, and a passionate lover, supportive and cheerful.

290,lamichhanehardik-96614,Pretty better than others,10,9 November 2018,I thought it was gonna be same as other teen comedy movies but no. It was such a sweet romantic yet comedy movie. A boy risking everything to get the girl of his life. Such a sweet blend of romance and comedy. Great!,The Girl Next Door

And now that iv just watched it last night I feel like I could watch it again! In fact I think I am going to now after this review or my 2 cents ha ha. Im no expert at movie reviews but I don't know how people are give it low starts. A lot of people complaining about it being a remake. But lately that's what a lot of movies are. From start to finished I enjoyed it, Was a very cheeky and exciting movie. I did laugh a lot to it. And at points I got frustrated when Danielle Went with Kelly, It got me angry and thinking to my self why Danielle. Why would you do that to your self again. Over all Was a great movie and I'm sad I missed out for so long! By the way think we can all agree that Elisha Was and is still beautiful. I'm a little late to it but think I found my new celebrity crush X'D",The Girl Next Door
292,RoninVato,"just like ""Risky Business"" -- without the intelligence",3,18 March 2005,"You can call ""The Girl Next Door"" a ""tribute to Risky Business,"" but that's just a long, over-generous way of saying ""rip off."" Greenfield (the unimaginative director) even lifts the same music! What he forgot was the social satire, the creative edge, and the killer cast that made ""Risky Business"" a classic. ""The Girl Next Door"" is a steaming gargantuan pile of teen-flick clichés. There isn't an original idea in this mess. Greenfield is so unoriginal, he even uses the same oh-it's-just-a-fantasy device twice. The result is a tedious 90 minutes of cynical teen-sploitation that's insulting to anyone with a modicum of intelligence. The only thing worth watching is Timothy Olyphant's dynamic, multi-layered performance as a porn producer. Rent ""Risky Business"" instead.",The Girl Next Door
293,wattle1999,"A Poor Remake of ""Risky Business""",4,25 April 2005,"This movie was awful. It's an updated version of the 80's Tom Cruise movie ""Risky Business,"" with Porn Star substituted for Prostitute. The characters are flat, at best, and none are believable. The adult film industry is imagined to be this slapstick type business at some times, and gritty and dirty (but not so much that the lead actress is undesirable for having been ridden like Amtrack) The script writers must have used every predictable cliché in the book. Even the product placement was done poorly. About the only thing positive that can be said this movie did better than the film it so blatantly copied, was to promote safer sex and condom usage, if you're having sex with a high risk partner.The Unrated Version of this movie is possibly worse than the theater screened version - it features a few extra seconds of T&A, and tons of stuff that was rightfully edited out for the sake of not having the theater audience gouge out their eyeballs.",The Girl Next Door
294,jdamen,Cameron Crowe Meets Risky Business,8,21 March 2004,"Saw a sneak of this film in Burbank.  Really enjoyed it.  It could be a huge hit if the marketing was tinkered with a bit.  Very similar to Cameron Crowe films, especially in shot compositions and the way music is incorporated. Elliott Smith's Angeles is used in a Graduate way.  All the music choices are perfect.  This flick has got a lot of heart and solid acting.  It's also very funny.  I dug it.  Cuthbert's character could have been fleshed out a bit more.  You really only see her through the protagonist's eyes and maybe that's best.  R-rated but innocent and sweet.  Definitely worth seeing in theaters.  Way better than the American Pie films.  On par with Risky Business.",The Girl Next Door
295,drqu1981,Unexpected Pleasure,10,20 April 2004,"I didn't expect anything out of this movie, and that was perhaps why I think it was simply great. The wonderful soundtrack helped to gel a decently well thought of plot that carried so much nostalgia with it. The best was perhaps the beginning yearbook picture scene, the director made a great attempt at capturing the audience's memories of the past. I actually thought the chemistry between the two leads were wonderful compared to other teen movies, it reminded me of the high school romances, and made me yearn for what they had. The ending was the only thing that was not up to par, because it is simply too perfect. Of course that's what everyone wants to see but I thought the scene with him in the Z4 and seeing Elisha was too too too perfect. Maybe I'm jealous, but this was a great movie",The Girl Next Door
296,rasmith-2,"Could have been great...But not bad, either",7,10 April 2004,"First, let's get this out of the way...Elisa Cuthbert is absolutely gorgeous. So on those merits alone, the movie can't be half bad. And actually it's not. Though it never reaches the lofty heights of the film it wants so badly to emulate, (Risky Business)it is a fairly enjoyable ride for about 2 hours. Early on the film has the feel of those great 80's teen sex movies and even uses traces of the Risky Business score. And even though the film does go off course a little towards the end, I can't help but appreciate the cast throughout. I do think that Elisa Cuthbert's character could have been fleshed out (pardon the pun) a little better. She was a character that was utterly engrossing and I wanted to learn more about her. But anyway, though not a great film by any means, the Girl Next Door is worth a look.",The Girl Next Door
297,CrimsonJet,If only every teen sex comedy were this way,9,15 August 2006,"The art of making a teen sex comedy is usually associated with immaturity and gross-out tactics that for some reason make most people double over in laughter (prime example: American Pie's ""Pale Ale"" scene). While those tactics usually prove to be quite entertaining, The Girl Next Door puts it all to shame.The most noticeable difference between this movie and the dozens of others in its genre is the form of the laughs; plenty of them are crude, but they still retain good taste. A lot of the lines are just plain great, such as when Eli sits in the kids' Health class claiming, ""I could make a better sex ed video with my mom."" Even more can be said about the characters. Half the fun of this movie is seeing the different sides of these teenagers as they deal with their problems, and how they develop in doing so. Eli is a hilariously shy teen with hormones raging beyond belief; Klitz reminds you of every nerd you've ever seen, yet the irony is that he's the ballsiest of the bunch; and Matthew's start as a highly motivated, up-tight kid who's almost too smart for his own good makes for even more fun when he comes out of his shell and becomes a realistic, confident young man. The acting in all these roles is better than most would expect, and the fact that each of the actors are about 20 years old makes it seem much more real than films that used actors like Jason Biggs and Freddie Prinz, Jr. as high school students. Elisha Cuthbert's performance is especially good as the sexy title character, Danielle: she pulls the character's air of hidden innocence off with great skill.Behind all the great humor and characters, The Girl Next Door's story and direction are just plain terrific, and for once in a teen sex comedy, there is a presence of vision. The camera angles and editing are well-utilized to reflect the mood of each scene. The incredible soundtrack gives it another big boost, as every track seems like it was made exclusively for its scene, especially in the ending sequence with the use of the Who's Baba O'Riley.Though this film is near-perfect, it does leave you wishing for more. Even though it's all richly entertaining, you finish the movie wishing that it made you laugh more than it did. However, that is no reason to miss this masterpiece.",The Girl Next Door
298,melephants_rule,The finest example of how a film can be superbly funny and amazingly sweet,9,7 October 2007,"A teen movie is not ususally my sort of film, but I like a good comedy and Elisha always brights up a man's day so I decided to give it a whirl. The premise is typical teen plot but the script is far more real (if you ignore the ex porn star moving in next door) than any other. It deals with first love in a way that is so personal that i defy anyone not to be touched by some of the moments in the film. The acting is spot on with Elisha and Emile showing an innocence that is necessary to stop the characters from becoming seedy and desperate. Although these two shine the stand out character and acting is by Timothy Olyphant, the villain of the piece. There are moments in the film where the comedy is kicked out of the park and you have to check again that you haven't flicked over to a psycho movie. But even he has some redeeming features. This movie is an example to all the EuroTrips and Old Schools out there who think crude is funny all the time and that's all you need in a film. The trilogy of modern comedy is now complete: The Girl Next Door| The 40 year old Virgin| Knocked UpI defy you to find three movies that will make you feel as good by the end and made in the last five years.

Sure, the old boy meets girl and has to save it kinda is there, but that was too expect. The Acting was a lot better than i expected and the storyline was really funny, so i can only give the advise to everyone who likes romantic comedy to watch this film.All in all a film you could watch even twice.

This, is definitely not a predictable movie.Sure, its packed with recurring themes and stereotypes from almost every teen comedy being churned out these days, but the writer doesn't use these as crutches for his characters, but just as filler for their personalities, while he concentrates on the twists and turns his main character is being pushed through.All in all, sure it borrows substantially from Risky Business, updated for a new generation, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.

For one, the story has pretty much been done before(i.e. Risky Business), Its the boy meet girl scenario which has been done a million times over from a million different angles and it its sprinkled a-plenty with tons of cheesy moments. But its the moments outside the cheesy ones that count in this film. The acting is excellent with some amazing characters making it the perfect combo in that category. The three main actors in the film,(Timothy Olyphant,Emile Hirsch,Elisha Cuthbert) are the some of the most engaging characters that I've seen in a comedy in awhile. Which admittedly isn't saying much but either way, the characters are good.

This is got to be one of the best comedy/romance movies that I have ever seen. You could almost pass the movie off as a true story. In the Girl Next Door, every young male's dream comes true; an incredibly beautiful girl moves next door and you and her fall in love. Most young guys could connect and relate with Emile Hirch (Matthew Kidman). For me and other young guys I know, this would be a dream come true. It's a shame that love can't always be like this. Both Elisha Cuthbert (Danielle) and Emile Hirch (Matthew Kidman) do a great job portraying their characters. The characters are written very well. Every love scene is incredibly believable. Their acting ability adds to an already great movie. The director, Luke Greenfield, did a great job with The Girl Next Door. This movie shows that two people can fall in love even if one feels that the other is out of his or her league.

There's enough T&A to keep the frat boys entertained, but The Girl Next Door, despite a couple of lapses in narrative logic, prevails thanks to the enthusiasm of its leads and a remarkably candid approach to sex not mired in heavy-handed moralism, a condition prevalent in these post-Janet Jackson/Boobgate times.

I cracked up when I watched this movie, and it had it's ''touching'' moments. The cast is flawless. Particularly the ridiculously beautiful and perfect Elisha Cuthbert. Every time I saw her on the screen my heart was beating faster and faster. Even the women who play the porn stars are gorgeous. Emile Hirsch is great and believable Matthew Kidman, Timothy Olyphant is one of my favorite villains in a comedy (perfect sleezball), and Chris Marquette and Paul Dano were hilarious as Matthew's two nerdy best friends. The movie all in all was really cute and funny. It made me think about high school and what memories I'll have when I'm done. This is definately gonna be a classic teen comedy for me.

312,goodgodwhatabeatnik,An excellent moral play.,8,9 March 2004,"The Girl Next Door: This film is directed by Luke Greenfield (The Animal) and written by David Wagner and Brent Goldberg (Van Wilder). From that information you might assume that this film is a generic mainstream comedy, and in that assumption you would be wrong. The Girl Next Door is an offbeat Romantic Comedy that defies the very genre that it is marketed to. Emile Hirsch (The Emperor's Club) stars as Matthew Kidman, a straight A college bound student whose life is turned upside down when he meets the Girl Next Door in question, Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert). Danielle catches Matthew staring at her changing through a window, and in punishing him they become friends. However, Matthew's pornography obsessed friend Eli (Chris Marquette) informs him that Danielle has a sordid past as a porn star. It becomes Matthew's goal to convince her that she's better than the pornographic industry, much to the chagrin of her producer Kelly (Timothy Olymphant). The Girl Next Door is a delightful comedy with much more than just teen raunch gimmicks. In fact, this film may be more suitable to an adult audience, which will appreciate the film's finer points a great deal more. The movie is a great romantic comedy with its morals in the perfect place, and is highly recommended. I'm debating on either a 7.5 or an 8, but I'll leave it at ****1/2 (A-) (8/10) for now.",The Girl Next Door

You understand Matthew as he struggles to become ""cool"". The director greatly succeeds in describing how Matt feels and reacts on different things. The actors feels very real as they speak a lot with there mime expressions. This is not a regular American Pie movie, it is a lot more realistic and not just happy movie. Much because of how the director works with the mime expressions, camera angles and soundtrack. I also recommend everyone to watch the movie with director commentaries on. It never becomes boring and it takes the movie to a whole new level with many small things you might not noticed.",The Girl Next Door
314,mojotheclown,A lot better than I thought it would be.,8,28 April 2004,"OK, I'll be the firs to to admit. There's only one reason I went to see this film - her name is Elisha Cuthbert. I know, I'm shallow, but I just felt like going to see her looking good for about 2 hours. Is that a crime? The only crime here is that this film has been judged according to the main actress, when to my surprise, this was actually a very entertaining, funny and heartwarming film.I expected the usual fare that has been seen oh-so-many times before. Yes, you can guess what happens in terms of the romance, (boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back again) but there was just more to this film than the others I have seen from the same genre. (You would have to class this as teenage romantic comedy I'm afraid.) Elisha is very good as an ex-porn star trying to lead a normal life, and Emile Hirsch is a very good choice as Matt, the intelligent student guy who wants to be cool, but for me the best performances are by Matt's two best friends, Eli and Klits. (with a K!) Eli had me in stitches a few times.Also, the film's music was excellent. Look out for the soundtrack, should be a very worthwhile purchase.Overall, a very entertaining film that is well worth seeing.

Lovely Elisha Cuthbert makes this almost watchable, but the lazy writing and tepid direction undermine the game cast.  As the previous reviewer noted, the film's attitude toward Asians is borderline racist (way to alienate a section of your audience, dude!).

All that will change when he gets caught sneaking a pick at his sultry next-door neighbor Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert), who just happens to be a porn star trying to quit the business.  They quickly fall in love and Danielle takes Matthew for a wild ride that teaches him  that ""sometimes you just got to say what the f**k!""This is clearly a rather poor remake of the 1983 picture Risky Business, which featured Tom Cruise and very young and breathtaking Rebecca De Mornay. This new version does not stand up to Risky Business in terms of either the story or cinematography and Elisha Cuthbert is no match for Rebecca De Mornay.  Where De Mornay's character was sexy, sophisticated, and real, Cuthbert's character does not extend much beyond her good looks.  At times, I was made with the director of this movie for trying to remake a very good movie and screwing up royally.  The scene between Matthew and Danielle in the limo (a cheap and uninspired knockoff of the De Mornay-Cruise scene in the Chicago subway) was just atrocious.To be fair, this movie has a few very funny moments, and the actors playing Kelly (Danielle's producer) and Eli (Matthew's friend Eli) did a great job.

320,epg-2,Brilliant coming of age flick and a rip-off of Risky Business all in one,9,24 August 2004,"I was completely blown away by this movie. The first half hour was what I expected from the commercials - the typical teenage sex romp, T&A flick that has been done a million times, showing nothing more inventive than American Pie or Porky's before it. At this point I wrote the movie off as nothing better, nothing worse then what came before it.Then, at about the hour mark, it morphs into one of the best coming of age movies Hollywood has produced in a long time. Suddenly the story is not about Elisha Cuthbert's physical attributes (though they are lovely), but about the perfect student/son breaking out of his cocoon and finding his true self in the ether. At the same time the movie transforms from a fairly standard teen flick into one of the more bizarre comedies released in some time. The movie unleashes a series of plot twists stranger than the one before it, culminating in an inventive climax and resolution. Add in some of the biggest belly laughs I've had at the movies since Old School, and it becomes perhaps the second most brilliant movie in the coming of age genre after Fast Times.Now, that said, it is important to note that ""Girl Next Door"" is a total ripoff of Risky Business. And a lazy one at that. The similarities are many - perfect son/student rescues sweet girl from flesh trade, fighting off evil, violent pimp/manager, etc. In fact, they go as deep as the editing and the way particular music was used to highlight key scenes.The assessment? If you can forget cinematic history, this is one of the more inventive, original and charming pieces of comedic cinema I have experienced in the last, say, five years. If you must remain true to what has come previously, it's a charming rip-off.9/10",The Girl Next Door

323,chicodustyblog,Sexiest Movie of all time!,3,7 January 2013,"When The Girl Next Door was released in 2004 it left quite an impression on lots of young men because the movie's set-up played on two key sexual fantasies of pubescent adolescents: A) The girl next door archetype who's good looks, laid-back nature and proximity to your parent's house highlights her as an ideal person to bang.B) Having sex with a porn star who's sexual experience is both intriguing and terrifying.Danielle (played by Elisha Cuthbert), the titular The Girl Next Door, is both the laid-back, good-looking girl of our dreams and has just left her life as a porn star. She immediately takes a liking to local dweeb and protagonist of the movie, Matt (played by Emile Hirsch).

Not exactly who'd you expect to play a former porn star. Everyone else is pretty much unknown in the UK. I bought in a buy one get one free deal with Starsky & Hutch. This was by far the better of the two. The actors all pull off great performances. The teenage boys are much more real then in Movies of a similar genre. The comedy is slightly more subtle then the likes of American Pie and Road Trip and are no were near as obvious. The plot is moved along by the comedy. The two stars Elisha Cuthbert and Emile Hirsch are convincing. But Chris Marquette, Paul Dano and Timothy Olyphant steal every scene they appear in. Obviously in a teen, sex, coming of age comedy there's nudity but its all for comedy not for the sake of pleasing 13 year old boys.

This movie is worth hell lot of your time. Elisha Cuthbert has given an OK performance but she does sure look like an angel.The purity and innocence.

Not to mention I didn't know any of the actors. Until Danielle makes him strip naked I was kinda bored, but that made me sit up and think,this is interesting....From then on the movie just got better and better resulting in a great ending and you realise that young people really can fall in love and sacrifice everything!! A thoroughly enjoyable movie.There was chemistry between the two,something which many teen movies lack. I would rate it 7/10 but 6.8 is good enough!

The characters were all good and unique, and the main characters (played by Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert)were very well acted out.Elisha Cuthbert is absolutely gorgeous, and she fitted the role very very well. The movie wouldn't have the same effect if it wasn't for her being cast as Danielle.I also think the idea of a girl moving in next door and being absolutely out of this world is a good concept - if only it happened more often to single guys.A strong effect this movie had on me is because I am single (or i am at the time I am writing this anyway!!, after watching this movie I really wanted a girlfriend myself, but after all, there is only one Elisha Cuthbert, and if it wasn't for her, this movie wouldn't have been half as good as it was!",The Girl Next Door

My doubts were soon put to rest by the brilliant Elisha Cuthbert and the obvious chemistry between her and Emile Hirsch. The film had me entertained throughout and I went through a roller-coaster of emotions from laughter to sympathy as I could relate to Matthew's feelings of isolation from the experience of my school years. There are plenty of twists in the plot along the way, and there are excellent supporting performances from Timothy Olyphant, James Remar, Chris Marquette and Paul Dano.The movie can get slightly unbelievable at times, but there are plenty of laugh out loud moments to keep you riveted. This is a highly entertaining film and I can thoroughly recommend it...",The Girl Next Door

I saw this movie with some friends and we'd all agree that this movie was the greatest teen comedy since American Pie.Although the story is kinda linear, the mood of the film carries it all the way. It is funny, romantic and not at all sugar sweat crap, like it could had turned out. Elisha Cuthbert is so natural astonishing HOT, and its hard not to fall in love with her yourself, just by watching this movie.I my self is from Denmark, and I really do not understand why the movie has been so underrated here, because I don't even remember if this movie was in the cinemas at all. However I got it on DVD and I love it.The thing I liked the most was that this movie is not bound by the censorship of United States. *minor spoiler* It is funny to see how Matthew succeeds, gets the girl etc even though he is on drugs, which is NOT usual in an American movie. *minor spoiler off*Thumbs up from Denmark!

She did a fantastic job and looking past all the cursing and porn (which is the reason most people probably watch it, so I realize I'm in the minority there) the movie made for a great story. It shows that you can turn your life around no matter what your past may hold and that when someone else believes in you, anything can happen. There is plenty to laugh at in the movie as well, so if you're really in the mood to just sit back, relax and not read too much into a movie...this will work for that too.

I simply love this movie and all the comedy it uses. Elisha Cuthbert did a great job in this movie and i am glad they casted her for this part. She perfected the Porn Star Role very good, yet didn't lower to the levels of real porn stars. Emile Hirsch also did a wonderful job. I watched the Emperor's Club but didn't recognize him. Emile was simply fantastic in playing an average every day kid who was kind of a loser. This movie really intrigued me mostly by the fact that they had a perfect cast. If a single person was changed I think the Entire Movie would have been cast off slightly and wouldn't be what we know it is today. I definitely rate this a 10 and encourage everyone who likes good laughs to go see this. Whether Rated or Unrated it provides an above average amount of humor and is the perfect movie for me.",The Girl Next Door

Certain parts were really funny, sad, romantic, happy and aesthetically pleasing for all the right reasons. No matter who you are or what your go to genre is, you must see this I recommend it deeply. The main thing that just gets it for me is that when I heard about the story, I thought that it would be a rubbish comedy about the porn star premise but it was pretty deep and it changed the way I judge films and that is my opinion.

The way that she and Emile (mathew) complimented each other in this movie was fenominal.

338,biflexx,80's rehash is mostly Spam,5,2 April 2006,"Generally pointless, often asinine, sporadic rip-off of 80's conservative/yuppie wet dream flick, Risky Business finds the enterprising teens moving from using women as prostitutes to get into college to using women in porno videos to get into college. Ahh, to be young, affluent, white and American! The storyline is largely far-fetched as are the irritatingly clichéd characterizations which include the clueless and zany parents, clueless and irritating teachers, horny and supposedly funny friends and a squeaky clean ""looking for love only"" leading man.Barely saving the film from its smirking self awareness (it seems to think it has a clever script) and gross commodity fetish politics are the curiously charming and sexy performances of the two leads, handsome Emile Hirsh and gorgeous Elisha Cuthbert. Both of them really should be lending their talents elsewhere as should the always dependable heel Timothy Olyphant (standing in for Guido the Killer pimp from Risky Business). They keep you interested in the nonsense unfolding which is more than this cheap, self important and finally vulgar teen comedy deserves.A word to those who think that excessive use of 1980's music (which truly most of these characters wouldn't know) and using key plot devices from Risky Business are somehow HOMAGE to 80's teen films... it's not homage.. it's called RIP OFF or as they say in L.A. a ""re-imaginging of a hit"".In spite of the leads charms, neither her curves or his handsome backside can save this tiresome rubbish.",The Girl Next Door
339,googles49_,Not a teen comedy. It's much more than that!,9,14 January 2006,"I don't like the way this movie was marketed as if it is a teen comedy. YES it has the jocks and the losers but I wouldn't class this as a teen comedy at all. It's so much deeper and really much more of a love story / adventure because that's what happens.The first 1/4 is pretty much your average Teen comedy and was mostly what you saw in the trailers. Hard working kid with no time for fun meets hot girl next door who just happen's to be a porn star with his loser mates talking about ""banging"" hot chicks and not getting any. Thats the plot overall but that doesn't make an enjoyable movie in my eyes. In fact I only watched this when a friend had it on DVD and let me borrow it. I didn't exactly go out my way to watch this. Now it's one of my favourite films.This is because of where the film takes you and how much you can relate to what's happening. How many of you have felt your working to hard when you're young and not having much fun? How many of you have seen the perfect girl and wanted her so bad you'd do the craziest stuff? Half the ""stuff"" that happens through the film (especially the ending) you wouldn't have predicted from watching the first 1/4 and I want to tell you all the ""stuff"" but that would really spoil the first viewing (there will be more).The film is almost perfectly made, the kids are all excellent and the two stars have sparks practically flying off them when they are together. The music is spot on and the twists and turns will take your emotions on a roller-coaster ride.This film is perfect for watching alone, with friends or with your girlfriend because its ""feel-good"", ""funny"" and really ""deep"" and really deserves better credit as it's more than just an above average teen comedy.

I wanted a refund even though I borrowed the DVD from the library for free. Don't even compare this flick with Risky Business, as many writers on this website has done. One is a classic and the other a pointless waste of film.Yes, Elisha Cuthbert is intensely beautiful and I hope to see her more frequently on the big screen. But The Girl Next Door utterly lacked substance and intelligence in order to showcase Cuthbert to horny teenagers in the audience. I don't mind the improbable and silly plot if they'd only work on the ridiculous dialogue -- ridiculous even for a lame-brain teen movie. I'll even overlook the nonsensical way Danielle and Matthew developed their affection if they'd just use some neurons in writing the script.The film was probably written for the sub-14 year old crowd, those who managed to sneak in to this rated R dog of a film.

347,dwntwn26,High School Genre Film Worth Seeing,7,12 April 2004,"The Girl Next Door is a perfect example of the lack of perception that movie studios sometimes operate with. When test screenings reportedly went through the roof, Fox knew it had a potential hit on its hands, and set out to market the hell out of it. It was important, though, how they marketed it--because though GND is a successful high school teen comedy, it's not necessarily a sex comedy. The trailer for the movie wants to promote a cross between Risky Business and American Pie, with a dash of porn tossed in, and so the advertising pushes the sex aspect, even though it's NOT what the movie's about.The Girl Next Door begins by evoking the feeling of dread that 99% of us get as we wind into the spring of senior year--that taste of emptiness that starts to fill the place in our minds we'd been saving for the kind of nostalgic memories that you write about in your last yearbook. Emile Hirsch is Matthew Kidman, dealing with this same problem as a potential Georgetown attendee with political aspirations who feels like he's missed out. And he pulls it off. He's neurotic, repressed, frustrated and scared all at once.And then Elisha Cuthbert moves into the neighborhood to shake things up.Cuthbert is Danielle, the ex-porn star with a heart of gold who's looking for a fresh start. Naturally, Matthew and Danielle hit it off; she shows him how to have all the fun he's been missing, and he gives her the confidence and courage to believe in starting over. Naturally, problems ensue when Matthew's academics begin to disintegrate.Timothy Olyphant plays scene stealer as Danielle's porn agent, and Chris Marquette and Paul Dano fill out what could have been hollow supporting roles as Hirsch's buddies to give the movie a deeper overall feel. While the spin on Risky Business is obvious and moments of sentimentalism and ludicrousness make you groan at times, it's always compensated for and ultimately overpowered by the movie's acute sense of pathos--it knows what should be endearing and what should be funny about a coming of age experience that features a porn star (i.e. three high school kids at a convention for the adult film industry in Vegas).As a comedy, The Girl Next Door is funnier than most anything out so far this year (save Kaufman's Eternal Sunshine). In terms of box office, the problem maybe seems to stem from the fact that Cuthbert's star was skyrocketing before the movie was ever in theaters, compelling Fox's marketing department to push the focus in the wrong direction. But the bottom line is that this movie is the first quality teen comedy to dramatize end-of-high-school anxiety since Ferris Bueller's Day Off. And if you think about it, Cuthbert's character is no more ridiculous than Ferris. (Seriously, did you ever know someone that EVERYONE liked in high school, who could get away with anything? Me either.) Go see this movie.",The Girl Next Door

At times it seems a bit similar to another film, ""Risky Business"", but this one is different enough! I also thought the music in the movie was good. While the topic was racy in nature, the female star does not take it all off, much to the chagrin of teen-aged boys everywhere. (But we have our imaginations!)

I found myself becoming attached to the two main characters Matthew and Danielle, as if I had always known them. They are both especially appealing actors in this ""not so much for children"" comedy. It does not matter if it was good or not, I simply found myself content and satisfied when it finished like I never had been before, and I am not a sucker for romantic peachy movies as this one may be marketed as, in fact I don't even watch many romantic comedies.

The first thing about this movie that i like is yes, it is a teen movie, but it does not rely on dirty jokes and down right stupidity to be funny. eg (american pie) Timothy Olyphant is great as Kelly and Emile Hirsch plays the role well of the teenage kid who is blown away when he see the beautiful Elisha Cuthbert (who also shines in this being her first feature film) has moved in next door.The film is written superbly, the cast all fit their roles and are genuine and believable. This is a fantastic teen comedy, not to mention one of my favourite movies.ps. Elisha Cuthbert is just so dam hot!!",The Girl Next Door

They were amazing in this movie, im fall in love every time i watched this. For elisha, the way she look at emile, the way she smile, she laugh was so perfect. I cant describe my feeling omg. I will tell my son in the future to watch this movie too haha. Everyone should watch this and u will know the magic power is real.

362,EweK13,best movie of the year.,10,27 February 2004,"All i have to say is after seeing this movie twice, it only gets better each time.  It's so much more than a teen comedy, it is a movie about growing up and steppingoutside of a protective bubble.  Emile Hirsh is really cute in the movie, not to mention an incredible actor.  All of the performances are right on especially Emile's film school friend.  Luke Greenfield has done a spectacular job writing/ directing this film.  While one realizes that this film is incredibly hard to market, one must also come to the understanding that this film should catch on likewildfire once the word gets out there.  Please, fox, do everything in your power to promote this film.  It has the comedy of american pie, the sexiness of wild things and the heart of october sky.",The Girl Next Door

Just about a guy who falls in love with the girl next door. I was like was sounds like a chick flick. But then i saw commercials for it on a channel wont let me say it for some reason, so i was like well might as well watch it nothing else to do so, i started watching it and i was like wow this is pretty good movie so then i just bought like 4 days ago. But yeah i think its a good movie the actors did perfect with all the eye contact and all of that i was really impressed Emile and Elisha did a really good job and i love it my favorite movie but also i would like to say that it is a really good life impression of movies because i mean a lot of guys think they wont get girls like that or i even think about that and it shows that u would do anything for love i know i would do anything for love i mean come on i would do that stuff for love also and the whole part about him finding out she was a porn star i wouldn't take her 2 a motel and bang her i would never do that i would just sit down and talk to her about the whole porn star thing and asking her y didn't she tell me because to me wat people do there job or anything that really doesn't matter 2 me wat matters it love wat u feel in the heart!My favorite line (The juice is worth the squeeze)",The Girl Next Door
365,xamf,Cuthbert kicks ass,10,3 February 2007,"Elisha Cuthbert is amazing. WOW!!!! What a body, and great acting skills. How come Hollywood hasn't ""found"" her yet? Her little one liners are awesome. I love the way she holds herself and is sooooo cool with her role. Her moods in the movie are played very well. Did I mention that she has an awesome body????? Yes...I suppose there are other characters in the movie...basically amounting to every high school guy's wet dream, but hey...that's all I could say without spoiling it for you. Finally, I really enjoy Elisha Cuthbert in all of her movies and really wish I could have lunch with her. I guess it isn't going to happen!!!",The Girl Next Door
366,hobojoes,Not what you would expect,7,6 December 2010,"When I first saw the trailer years ago they made it seem as if this movie was a typical high school flick with the young guy with a crush on his porn star next door neighbor. Well I can say that I was pleasantly surprised after seeing this movie that is wasn't your typical high school flick. Yeah there was the gratuitous nudity but with a porn star as one of the leads that is inevitable. This movie had heart and soul, there were really good leads played well by all. Timothy Olyphant as the porn producer was the highlight of the movie for me at least, he hasn't been in too many movies where I actually liked his acting so that was definitely awesome to see one of my favorite television actors finally playing a good role. Emile Hirsch is one of my favorite young actors so I've been waiting to see this for a while , and he definitely didn't disappoint, totally different than any other role he has played. The movie was more about falling in love than just about having sex as the trailers seem to make you think, so if your looking for a good movie to see with your significant other this is for you.",The Girl Next Door
367,carlie_ann,Not what I expected,7,4 February 2004,"When I saw the previews for this film I had to say I didn't expect much. When I saw it at a free screening last week in Seattle I was actually really happy I went. This film is amusing and funny. It reminded me of ""Risky Business"" with the taboo topic of sex with a porn star instead of a prostitute. Elisha Cuthbert is fantastic in this film and leaves quite an impression. This movie was hilarious and had a nice balance of high school humor and adult humor. I would definately go and see it again.",The Girl Next Door
368,FabianNMunoz,they always say meeting a girl changes Everything,10,24 September 2008,"I saw this movie back in 2005. I had heard so much about it that I figured I might as well see it. But I didn't have the time to finish it the first time I saw it (I only got to the strip bar scene). Now comes the interesting thing: I had not actually finished the movie until just last night! But I still remember my first impressions when I saw it 3 years ago. The introductory scenes were so well filmed and put together that they stayed with me in my mind all this time. The movie celebrates what we all one way or another dreaded seeing come to pass: graduation and commencement. American Pie celebrates it with a humorous and raunchy romp through very similar characters. But it was Risky Business that this movie conjured images of as I watched.Girl Next Door tells us the tale of Matthew Kidman: a young high school student in his senior year (Emile Hirsch) and his two best friends: the mischievous Eli (Chris Marquette), and Klitz (Paul Dano) the the geek with a heart...on. Matthew has received a letter of acceptance from Georgetown, and needs to solidify his chance of winning a speech contest for a scholarship. His school life is on edge, as he struggles to keep high marks and still be himself (and come up with a decent speech).But he can't help but notice that the other kids (the populars/jocks) are always so...free. They skip class. They go places. They do what they want. But he simply dismisses it as ""because they don't care"".The rest of the movie goes on the notion that what if morality isn't everything. What if fun meant more? This interesting concept is further pushed when a new neighbor moves in next to him. Danielle (Elisha ""god shes hot"" Cuthbert) is a typical girl next door...shinny and vibrant and smoking hot. She's a blond with a killer body. And she used to do porn! Matthew definitely falls for her at first sight, but has no clue about her past. But gradually this pair of opposites attract. You get the impression that Cuthbert's character seems relieved to find a good guy. And she begins to entertain this little infatuation of his (really funny ""dream"" sequences).His life is turned upside down as she shows him how to live fun and free. In the meanwhile, his absence in class has been noticed by both his teachers and his friends. Matthew tries to Eli about this new neighbor of his, but he instead tries to turn it into another sex fantasy. Matthew truly believes in what he's experiencing with this girl. That is, until Eli uncovers the fact that she's done porn! In another effort to turn the whole thing into a fantasy, Eli tells Matthew to pursue her ""as if she's just a porn star"". Matthew has to decide if Danielle wants the good guy or the bad boy.I leave it there as the movie is just much too awesome for to me spoil. For those who have seen it and have read my comment, you'll find it funny how I managed to go 3 years without ever getting past the strip bar scene.An absolutely true and daring movie, with the best message to deliver to our young graduates: the juice was definitely worth the squeeze.",The Girl Next Door
369,cgma,"Completely out of touch with reality, mediocre predictable.",5,18 July 2004,"I watched this film because I thought it would be fun, and because of Elisha Cuthbert. In the end I found myself rather disappointed. To begin with the plot isn't that fun, nor funny, except for a very few jokes, it is all very stupid. The acting has nothing special at all, it could be all right, but the story is just too brainless, it's almost frustrating to watch. I really thought I would enjoy this film, and even thou I like Cuthbert a lot, I don't think she's worth it, this film doesn't give any positive emotions, it's pretty mediocre and leaves no feeling, nothing at all, except of course a feeling that one has badly invested his time.Next to this film, American Pies and other teen movies look fairly good.My advise is to watch this film only if you are bored to death, or if you really like Elisha Cuthbert.",The Girl Next Door
370,grahamvriend,Hottest girl in the world... no question,9,2 March 2008,"Elisha Cuthbert is absolutely the hottest girl alive. She makes the movie one to be watched over and over again. The movie is well written, very well edited, and the movie really has some core values; one of them is risking everything for the one you love, another is standing by your friends (""tripod""). Also the story is amazing.. its about giving people second chances... Elisha plays the young lost pornstar and Matthew Kidman believes that she is more than that. I only wish I was in his shoes! Although some parts may seem amateurish.. (The porn director pointing his fingers..., When he loses Sam-Yangs money... it seems a bit weak...) but it doesn't matter because it is flooded out by the spectacular somewhat realistic story of a teenage love. Anyone who hasn't seen the movie... WATCH IT!!! Anyone who has seen the movie... WATCH IT AGAIN!!!",The Girl Next Door
371,ceast02,Hmmmm,7,11 September 2008,"I liked it much better the first time...when it was called ""Risky Business."" Yet, I couldn't look away. I am not sure if it was legitimate interest or the fascination you feel when you pass by a horrible car wreck. Hmmm. Also, I cannot believe that this ridiculous website insists that you write 10 full lines. Especially, if the movie doesn't warrant it. Afterall, if they producers don't want to give me an original movie to evaluate then why should I give this website an original critique. I mean, ""come on."" I am sure glad that I gave a phony email address as well as a bunch of bogus personal information. So now I have to type this last line to make sure that I get 10 full lines in here.",The Girl Next Door
372,DuDeZoR,a good movie...if you have patience,10,21 March 2004,"As you may already know, the movie starts out with a teenager in high school, who dreams of attending Georgetown University in the fall. He is the student body president and a perfect goody goody senior. He never skips class or does anything crazy. One day, a beautiful girl moves in next door to him, and he is really attracted to her. The meet and start to hang out, and take part in some crazy stunts, nothing sexual. Soon, the guy starts to fall for her, only to find out she is a porn star. Then the plot continues and it can be predicted to some degree, but ending has a nice twist, which I like. This movie handles the erotic content maturely, and I believe its worth the 2 hrs. The plot is somewhat drawn out, but it is worth seeing.",The Girl Next Door
373,victor_a_lau,An obscene and indecent movie. Really??,10,10 October 2009,"After watching this amazing movie with Elisha Cuthbert and Emile Hirsch probably 5 or 6 times, I decided to do some research about its beginnings.I found comments ranging from disgusting and unappealing to charming and sexy. But, what is the truth behind one of the most controversial teen movies of all time?? Here it goes: First, my point of view of this movie(as you can see in my vote) is that it is a success. 4 nominations? Not a lot of movies get that many. But what I really want to discuss in this movie is the subjective and most symbolic aspects. This kind of movies may be found obscene and unpleasant, but once you watch this one, your opinion about teen movies with sexual themes is going to change.Lets look at the life of Danielle. Ex-porn star at just the age of 19, and now she wants to change her life. But, of course, most juveniles her age have seen or heard about a movie she has been part of. I can only imagine how difficult it is for somebody like her to get someone in her life, moreover for love life. So, let's look at it this way, she is looking for a second chance, nobody would give a single try, but there is always someone, that special person that in the end, appears in your life. And that is when Matthew Kidman comes in. This high school senior geek lives a boring life in school, never getting the chance to live the fullest. He finds her, and both receive a 180 degree turn to their lives. This girl is just beautiful, charismatic and loving. She finds herself getting the chance she wanted and enjoying being a new person, all because of the help of Matthew. Great love story.Now, lets go for Matthew. Shy, geeky, but also smart, charismatic and devoted to his cause, this high school senior with aspirations to a scholarship to Georgetown University gets a whole twist in his life when Danielle comes in. Now, he finds himself struggling with his emotions and feelings. But in the end, he knows what is best to do, and that is to give it all for the girl that changed his life and made him a happier and most sociable person. He loves her from the first time, and the way he fights for the love of Danielle is just unbelievable, even risking his chances to go to college. That is what if call moral fiber.Forgiveness, I believe, is what would describe what is happening in this film, and a second chance to the lives of two completely different youths who needed each other to find their inner selves. Love, true friendship, and lots of devotion are also the greatest aspects of this movie. Sacrificing what you think is right, to do the RIGHT thing for that special person.So really, why do we settle for less, why try something new for one time. The experience will change our point of view. The Girl Next Door is one of the GREATEST titles about love, friendship and devotion(once again this three) of all time.And of course, in the end, when you watch it, enjoy it, and see the most inner and philosophical point of view, you know the juice was worth the squeeze",The Girl Next Door
374,MrJones2002,Finally a Teen Comedy That Gets it Right!!!!!!!!,9,22 February 2004,"I had such high expectations for this film because of it's fantastic cast. Emile Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert, Paul Dano... they're all so extremely talented, but I won't lie that I went in a little worried to see such actors in such a ""typical"" teen comedy.But in fact, I came out with my expectations exceeded.  This wasn't just a typical teen comedy.  The story is amazingly original.  It has new jokes other than that of the American Pie series.  The performances are right on the money... Emile is just perfect and is seemingly having a flawless career.  Elisha is awesome, sexy and vulnerable and Paul Dano, Timothy Olyphant and Chris Marquette and hilarious comic relief.Even the writing and directing seem far superior than what may be expected. To sum it up, I haven't had this much fun at the movies in a long time.",The Girl Next Door
375,james-833-945095,better than you think,9,25 September 2010,"OK, so when i sat down to watch this it was purely because i had nothing else to do. I started the film with absolutely no expectations as most films like this are awful. The start to middle of the film is your usual run of the mill storyline, at about halfway through it comes to a point almost identical to that in ""I Want Candy."" i was expecting this to be the end but then it took a unique turn and carried on for another 50 minutes (although i didn't feel the film was dragged out at all). The second half of this flick is more than enjoyable and certainly the best in its genre that i have seen. i would recommend this to anyone who's just in the mood for a good laugh. the best thing about this film without a doubt is the originality, you really cant see some of it coming at all. watch this if you want a bit of good fun, and a film that will leave you with a warm feeling :)",The Girl Next Door

While surprsingly amusing and entertaining to watch, the story strays away from the cliche of losing the girl/winning her back, since the whole history of pornography must first be dealt with through often enjoyable experiences that the main character undergoes. The movie was worth seeing if you're in the mood for a light love story with a twist to the classic syntax of high school graduation.",The Girl Next Door
377,srejon2001,Very Cool Movie,7,30 May 2011,"First of all I admit I like the basic story of this movie. And about casting & direction its just perfect.I enjoyed every minute of it. If you like teenage comedy movie, then its perfect for you. & really like the climax. Not its DVD & blue ray's are out. so you can grab it. Largely (and unjustly) ignored at the box office this teen comedy starts of really well and within the first few moments had me rolling with laughter. The movie starts with a montage of sorts, we see the jocks, brains and cheerleader-types all stating, for their entry in the yearbook, what they ""will always remember."" Then there is Matt (played by Hirsch) who is pondering this question. Sure, he has had a successful academic career - as illustrated by his acceptance to Georgetown - but he really hasn't done anything memorable in his senior year of high school.",The Girl Next Door
378,rct56,Really surprised me,10,14 April 2004,"This movie really surprised me. I went on opening night, because my friend and I were pretty bored. Seeing the commercials, I was really thinking that this movie was gonna be crap! I had really low expectations coming into it. Well, I was completely wrong and am very surprised at how much I actually liked it. It isn't your typical teen comedy (which I usually don't like). It was infact pretty funny, with enough comedic scenes throughout to keep it going. Not only that, but it also had meaning and was pretty dramatic at times. I feel that this movie in one way or another can relate to everyone. Anyway.... by now you all should know that the actress, Elisha Cuthbert is drop-dead gorgeous. The movie is practically worth it just for her, but the fact that it is indeed funny makes this movie an enjoyable experience. I recommend this movie to anyone, and I would give it an 8/10",The Girl Next Door

380,MAllen_Rodney,Great Film,10,27 April 2004,"After waiting ages to see the film and being ill on the week of release and being to busy to see the film at the cinema I finally got to see this rather addictive and brilliant film yesterday.The film is one of the best teen comedies in a long while with no disrespect to American Pie Series but this film was brilliant, and even more so as Elisha was given her chance to shine on the big stage.
The film had loadsa plus points - the acting by Elisha was top notch, her portrayl of the character Danielle was brilliant - she really cared for Matthew and knew if he found out her secret he would not like her and she wanted him to like her for who she was. I felt this scene was really good as we got to see Danielle as a person and how she doesn't always want to b seen as a Porn Star.The interaction btween Danielle and Matthew was great - the chemistry was there alrighte - wish I was an actor and played the role of Matthew.One idea thoe I felt cud have lasted till the end is Danielle and Matthew getting together, it wud have been good if they got together just b4 the prom and the end not half way through it, as the second half of the film lacked spice I felt.Eli is one funny character - everytime he spoke he made me laugh and he reminds me of someone at my 6th form college. The supporting cast were excellent, Danielle's manager Kelly was funny and thought he was gonna get Matthew into trouble wiv the tape but was shocked to see what was on it, so Matthew kinda got his own back.I will definatly buy this film when it is released on DVD sometime soon I hope and will watch it again and again. For a longer and fully version of my own review on the film plz visit my site which will hopefully b updated more often in the coming weeks.This film is excellent, Elisha is amazing in this film and every scene she is in is brilliant as she lights up the screen wiv her looks, a truly talented and fine actress.",The Girl Next Door
381,nicolasv-1,"Very Funny, Very Crude! Just don't miss it!",10,29 August 2004,"I went to see this movie with a high expectation of seeing Elisha Cuthbert nude (Like most people). However I enjoyed the fact that I was denied this pleasure, I sat through this movie and enjoyed the many very funny and terrific ""one liners"" and great visual comedy. The stand outs are ""Eli"" and ""Klitz"". You could in many ways compare this to the American Pie series of movies. The movie is ""popcorn"", very crude is some places, but overall very, very funny. Just don't take anyone under about fifteen years of age with you when you watch it. One interesting point is Elisha Cuthbert, I ask ""Could a Director please give this young lady a good script""?

If I could sum this movie up to any teenager in one word, I would let one word roll out of my mouth, that word is classic. As bieng a fan of these types of movies, once I saw this movie I havent been able to wipe the smile off my face. When you have a young cast you would expect for nothing more than a horrible movie, such as Summer Catch. Yet that movie didn't really have a plot, I would definately say I would watch The Girl Next Door an infinate amount of times before I would watch Summer Catch again. This movie adds a little Romance, Comedy, and momentary amounts of Suspense. While watching this movie, through the twists and turns, I kept asking myself what can they think of next to make this movie keep getting better and better. This movie starts and ends strong and I would reccomend it to anyone over the age of 14. **NOTE** this movie does have some adult themes as you can see from the plot. Some Nudity also, but NOT Elisha Cuthbert. Sorry Boys, I was hoping also =) just kidding. Im Out.",The Girl Next Door
383,edetkins,"Weak, soft attempt at a teen comedy",4,31 January 2004,"While kind-hearted and absent of any major flaws, 'The Girl Next Door' doesn't take any chances or break any significant new ground.  It's content has been covered ad nauseum in countless other teen comedies.  So what it becomes is a vehicle for a rising star (Elisha Cuthbert) and for a few wannabees (the boys - one looks, acts, and sounds like a young John Cusack), and for a few has-beens (Timothy Bottoms and Timothy Olyphant).  So it's pretty much a gawk-and-drool fest for the ""it girl"".  The plot has a few holes, unlikely twists, and takes one major loop too many on it's way to the movie's end, and it adds minutes to film that should have been cut.  The whole thing feels too long, and could have been edited and ended more gracefully.  The soundtrack is sloppy, intrusive at times, and uses some older music well but also makes strange choices that just aren't cool. This movie won't be reviewed well by critics when they get their hands on it.",The Girl Next Door

He watches porn while talking to his friends on the phone and even while they hang out.  I recommend the movie to anyone who is a fan of teen sex comedys or even romantic comedies, as the movie was finished my friends and I, all felt intrigued to just tell our special ladies how much they meant to us...And for all you immature people wondering if she gets naked, she doesn't, but other ""porn stars"" do.

I did not know hardly anything about this film until I went and saw it - it was great.  Elisha Cuthbert, Emile Hirsch, and Timothy Olyphant (really great) were outstanding.  The movie is in the same category as the cult classics from the 80s such as Risky Business, Sixteen Candles, and Ferris Bueller.  It also has the flavor of American Pie but I feel this movie is right up there with or better than American Pie.  My wife and I highly enjoyed this film and we both highly recommend it.

In comparison to the movies you think this movie would be like (ie The Scary Movie Trilogy, Not Another Teen Movie, etc) it was really like them in the sense that you could see it had somewhere to go instead of someone to make fun of.

Unfortunately, that is the way it was marketed back in 2003-4 (I remember seeing this movie being advertised on television when I was ten years old and all I could retain from the commercials was the possible high amount of sexual content in it!).This is my first review. I was always tempted to do one, but I never found a film that sufficiently inspired me to do so... until now. I have never been so attached to a character before. The script is surprisingly deep (compared to what I really expected) and the comedic sequences are well inserted in the film without making them appear unnecessary or awkward. The best part about this movie is that everything ends on a optimistic mood. No bad feelings of revenge or of any other sort. There are no losers: it's a real feel good movie.Among the reviews that I have seen, a lot of people gave the film a 10/10. I usually reserve those for serious and thought provoking movies such as American History X, Fight Club, Dark Night, just to name a few; however, it definitely does not deserve a 6.8/10 either. I give it a 7.5-7.7/10, especially after watching it a second time (The first time I watched this I couldn't fall asleep after because I couldn't believe how flipping good it was).This is not an objective sophisticated review like I sometimes see for some movies. But this movie touched my heart so much that I am actually writing this at 2 AM (right before my final exam the same day) so this greatly demonstrates the quality of this true work of art.",The Girl Next Door
392,finnluck,great movie-going experience,10,14 April 2004,"Everyone looks for something different in a movie.  Some people want to be frightened, some people want to be mentally challenged, some people want to be shocked.  Personally, the kind of movie that I like most is the one that leaves with a good feeling not just as you leave the theater, but for the rest of the day.  Girl Next Door did that for me.  Let me start by saying that I'm not a high school kid who wishes that I had more fun and crazy times, and I'm not a college kid lamenting missed opportunities in high school.  I'm just a regular 20-something, the demographic at which I can only assume this rated R film was aimed (they don't make any money off under-aged teens sneaking in after buying a ticket for another movie.).  I think what made this movie so enjoyable was not high school reminiscence but two very valuable take home messages.  First, sometimes the greatest things that happen to us are the ones we don't expect.  Second, at the end of the day, its not money, prestige or accomplishments that really make us happiest, but people.  Will this movie solve any of your life's problems? I doubt it.  However, you will get some solid laughs and you'll leave the theater feeling good about the fact that sometimes in life, despite ups and downs, everything comes together to make something great.I would feel remiss if I didn't also say something about the greatness that is Elisha Cuthbert.  I watch a lot of movies, and movies are chock full of really beautiful women (perhaps one of the reasons I watch so many movies). Elisha is a cut above the rest.  Way above the rest.  In fact, if you are Elisha Cuthbert, and you have penchant for talking about how great you are, feel free to send me a message, and I would be happy to oblige.  Seriously though, it went beyond appearance and to how she played the role.  I think she did an impressive job of creating a character that was at the same time sympathetic but also believable.  I think the movie overall was both well cast and well acted.  A movie that aims at humor/drama/romance can easily come out cheesy or just not funny.  In this case, I think that the movie is all kinds of funny but certainly doesn't overdo it, and the actors deserve credit for that.Before I conclude, I think that I should say something about claims that this movie is just a rip off of classic 80's movies.  Personally, I have to disagree.  I know the classic 80's teen drama's quite well.  I watched from about 100 yards away as John Hughes and company filmed Cameron and Ferris launching the infamous Ferrari into the ravine (my friends and I used to go down there and look for Ferrari parts on weekends for years afterwards.). Risky Business was filmed primarily in the house of a family friend.  To those that think that Girl Next Door draws too heavily from movies like these, I can say only this: you see what you are looking for.  If you go into a film thinking that it will be a rip off, nine times out of ten you will see it as a rip off.  If you go in with an open mind, you may enjoy it more than you thought.Of course, these are all just the opinions of one man.  Well, to be fair, me and the group of 15 year olds in front of me at the box office that all bought tickets for The Prince and Me and then snuck into Girl Next Door and ended up sitting in front of me.  They seemed to like it a lot too.10/10 - purely for providing me with some of the best fun I have had in a theater in months, and if you knew me, you would know that is saying quite a lot.",The Girl Next Door
393,Lazyaznguy,Very Enjoyable,10,11 March 2004,"I saw this movie a couple of weeks go and definitely enjoyed it.  The acting is solid and there are a fair amount of good funny scenes.  There's some stuff that's a bit unrealistic, such as Matthew(Emile Hirsch) and Danielle(Elisha Cuthbert) hooking up in one night and falling completely in love in a couple of days, but for the most part their relationship/chemistry isn't too horrible.  The movie had a lot of stuff that could have been better, but it's still a fun movie without the typical gross out teen sex comedy stuff.  I would definately pay 8 bucks to watch this again when it comes out next month and recommend it to most teenagers and young adults. The story and relationship between Matthew and Danielle is good enough to make you forget the weak parts of the movie.",The Girl Next Door
394,midlandseafishing,A bit of a shock!,10,6 September 2004,"Well I wasn't expecting this, but as a lead I will tell you that in my opinion this is fantastic. Before now the best teen type movie was ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"". A great film because it went past the teen film genre and threw in an escalator of scenes that kept you held. Now this film does the same thing, but it adds twists too.The American Teen Genre has for a long time been perfected, but it has been lacking twists due to the fact they have no depth. Lets be honest, if you add depth to an American Teen film it stops being what it is meant to be.Enter ""The Girl Next door"". The Director has managed to make a film that still stays in the same genre, and yet has just enough depth to be able to pull off a few twists. What a good job the Director did too! There is not much let up, and one second your feeling sorry for him, another second your feeling happy for him as the film turns from being a comedy to a drama and back to a comedy again in a relentless fashion. Not quite edge of the seat stuff, but then again it isn't supposed to be. This genre isn't supposed to be this good! I must add a comment that it isn't a family film, and unless you want your kids to watch a few porn stars strut about your house plying there body's to would be producers and directors then you had better make sure you have got them to bed before you put the disc in. John Hughes, the director of Ferris, Uncle Buck and more has a new challenger. Great Story, well written and directed, great acting.",The Girl Next Door
395,ecfan,Better than expected,10,13 March 2004,"This movie is apparently coming out April 9 now; maybe they want to get more press first. I got to see a sneak preview, and this movie actually made me feel for the characters at the end. Strange, but true. It has bits of everything - drama, comedy, etc. Mostly too bizarre to be real but has a strange touch of believability. You'll probably be able to find some character in the story to relate to -- the nerdy kid, the popular guy, etc. I really did not think that this movie would be something I'd watch other than for Elisha Cuthbert (certainly, it doesn't hurt that she's mezmorizing), but I'd say on the whole it was really well done, and something completely different from what movies are like these days. This isn't a rehash of anything, so it's worth a watch.",The Girl Next Door
396,theyoungones66,Ho hum,2,17 March 2004,"Me and three friends went to see a sneak preview of this film.  One guy liked it, the other three hated it.  This is a movie of missed opportunities. All the elements are there for a really raunchy and fun teen/sex comedy, but the writers and director messed it up and tried to do too many things at once. Oh, there are some laugh out loud funny bits and Elisa Cuthbert is a real hottie, but the film ultimately cops out and tries to be earnest.  Director Luke Greenberg has really improved since his first film (which isn't saying much), but the pacing is all over the place and the movie has too many endings.  Worth a rental, but not much more. American Pie is the big leagues.  This is strictly minor league.",The Girl Next Door
397,ten31isfun-shop,Homage to Risky Business...,10,25 March 2004,"I loved this film! First let me add a disclaimer-- ""Risky Business"" is one of my top 5 movies of all time. I would be very easily jaded by any film that attempted to remake such a classic. But I was not jaded by ""The Girl Next Door,"" because- for once- they did not merely attempt to remake a great film- rather, they paid homage to one by making an equally entertaining movie in the spirit of ""Risky Business"" that speaks to a new generation. It is also a film worthy of comparison to some of John Hughes' classics like ""Weird Science"" and ""Pretty in Pink."" Sure, it has some minor structural flaws here and there, but, overall, this film is so funny, the characters so endearing, and the set pieces so outrageous that I was downright ready to jump out of my seat with excitement over how much fun I was having watching this. I haven't felt this way about a film in years! Come to think of it, I haven't felt this way about a film since I watched ""Risky Business."" Thanks for taking me back in time and reaffirming that those same emotions are still alive and strong today. And what a soundtrack!! Sneaker Pimps, Filter, The Who, The Verve, Marvin Gaye- coupled with songs from the great ""Risky Business"" soundtrack like Muddy Waters' Mannish Boy and Tangerine Dream cues as well. Who could ask for much more?-- Except maybe more Elisha Cuthbert! Rebecca DeMornay, time to step aside, I now remember what it feels like to be infatuated again. And a star making turn from Emile for sure. Great job to everyone involved. Studios execs, please take note- this is proof that the word `teenager' does not have to defined as dumb. Movie lovers- check this one out for pure, clever fun!",The Girl Next Door
398,dark_stalker_cs,a surprise,10,22 March 2004,"when i first went into this movie, i only wanted to see it for elisha cuthbert who is extremely beautiful but after, i was pleasantly surprised. although there was no true nudity from her, i liked very much the plot/musical score. it was all very well done as well the acting by both main characters were amazing. i enjoyed this immensely and i recommend it to anyone. ps, the fake sex scene just ruined everything.As a final word, i would just like to say i will be planning to view this movie once again when it comes out officially in theatres as its one of the best movies iv seen and i dont really know why as i usually despise romantic comedy's and reserve them for rentals forced upon by friends, etc. This is a very well directed movie though i do have to say.",The Girl Next Door
399,bwb25,"Wait one sec on the bad comment, this movie was GREAT!",10,22 March 2004,"I had the privilege of seeing this movie three weeks before it comes out to audiences around the world and it was perhaps the funniest and most genuinely uplifting movie I have seen in years.  Now perhaps my attraction to the heroine, Elisha Cuthbert or my rapport to the main character, Emile Hirsch blinded me to the trite plot, but this movie did not lack comedy. The only time I did not hear the entire audience laughing was when the credits were rolling.  Furthermore, while walking out of the theater I overheard numerous people wishing the movie came out sooner so they could go see it again.I admit that one does not have to think during this movie, but thank god for that.  There are too many overly artsy, pseudo-intellectual, ""I think I'm smart because I go to this movie,"" Films today.  The Girl Next Door is fun to go to, has a wonderful plot, is written quite well and has amazingly good acting from a bunch of no names especially Timothy Olyphant.   Frankly, the person who doesn't like this movie is probably stick-in-the-mud that shouldn't be going to this type of movie anyway.  If you don't like witty comedy, original characters or a quick and smart plot, do not go to this movie.",The Girl Next Door
400,oscar2003,Good Movie,10,22 March 2004,"I saw this movie this Saturday Sneak Preview Style. I was looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time. When the movie was done and I exited the theatre, I felt a sense of happiness. This happiness did not stem from a good movie but rather Elisha Cuthbert. I wasn't aware how beautiful this girl was till this movie. She really did make the movie for me. Let me be honest, I am a sap for Romantic Comedies and when I first saw the trailer, it looked like the perfect movie. It had a beautiful girl and a nerdy boy in a funny but quirky situation who fall in love. The perfect Romantic Comedy.As the movie goes on, it has many funny moments and I was rather entertained by it for the whole 2 hours. I'm not going to lie to you, this movie has its flaws. It seems like its going to end many times before it finally actually ends. I personally did not mind the movie going on as long as it did. It means more Elisha Cuthbert. I never realized how beautiful this girl is till this movie. She makes the movie. Brilliant casting job. Plot...not really plausible but who goes to watch a movie for its realism?? Simply Put...The Girl Next Door is definitely worth spending your money on. You will enjoy it.",The Girl Next Door
401,zrweiss,A Refreshing Break from the Traditional Teen Comedy,10,27 March 2004,"While although knowingly remaking Risky Business and containing elements from both American Pie and Weird Science, this movie is very unique and in a class of its own. While of course containing the hilarious raunchy behavior necessary for a teen comedy, it also contains surpisingly good acting, timely one-liners, an intriguing story and a fantastic soundtrack.  The editing and use of music in this movie is amazing.  The story takes a look into the life of Matthew Kidman (Hirsch), an overlooked, overachieving high school senior who draws a blank when reflecting on his time in high school, shortly before graduation.  His life suddenly changes when Danielle (Cuthbert), a beautiful and free spirited teen moves in next door to house-sit for her aunt.  They immediately fall in love because they see things in each other that no one else sees.  Their relationship is thrown a curveball by Matt's discovery that Danielle is a porn star trying to find a way out.  The rest of the movie is Matt's quest to break Danielle out of the industry, much to the chagrin of her charismatic but overprotective porn producer Kelley (Olyphant).  The movie then takes many more twists and turns and Matt brings his nerdy but adventurous sidekicks along for the ride, thus providing many moments of comic relief. The movie has many endearing qualities, and belongs in a genre by itself.  All in all it is a great tale of living up to one's potential and can relate to people of all ages.  A must see",The Girl Next Door
402,paulmunn9,Saturday night popcorn fun film,8,28 October 2004,"Yeah OK so its not going to win any Oscars, but who wants to always sit down watching a film that has won so many gold statutes, that by halfway through the film your either thinking about ending your life by choking on an over expensive pick and mix sweet or you just lose the plot.At least this did not take it self seriously and gave me a bloody good laugh. Smutty and purile? yes it is, but what do you expect in a film about an ex porn star and a group of teenagers.If this isn't normally the film you'd go and see/rent/buy do yourself a favour leave your brain on the side table and treat yourself to a good laugh.",The Girl Next Door
403,toddsarti,What its really about,8,9 April 2004,"I just got back from seeing this movie at the theater this afternoon and I must say I really enjoyed it. I liked alot of the small details which I wont get into, but I wanted to comment on the main theme of the movie as I saw it. The movie, not unlike alot of other films before it, illustrates that life often surprises you when you least expect it and that sometimes you have to break free of your restraints, take some chances...on both ideas and people, to change your life for the better. This movie was great in showing the growth of the characters throught the movie, particularly Matt. Its an inspiring tale about how people very much unlike you can change you for the better. I do recognize it is quite a rip off of Risky Business, with a little different spin, particularly with the mushy-mushy lovey dovey stuff (which I liked). And to top it off, I think the visuals were very pleasing to the eye.I dont mean ""The Girl"". I mean Emile and Paul. Nice. This is one I will surely be getting on DVD.",The Girl Next Door
404,bn700a,Far better than the reviews,9,13 April 2004,"After reading eberts review I thought, it might not be worth watching but had nothing better to do. I gave it 9/10, would have given 10/10 as it was the best movie that I have seen so far this year, but there was too much violence to my liking. I found it better than American Pie/Dumb & Dumber. However, that is probably because I am a hopeless romantic (and also still/again single) and when I was a teenager, one of my favorite films was Can't buy me love (1987).. ..the kind of romantic girls/women there is on films, I don't think exists at all in real life. Too bad. But fun to watch films with such and dream of one.",The Girl Next Door
405,todd-339-156814,Elisha Cuthbert is stunning and I can't seem to stop watching this film,9,20 February 2019,"I watched The Girl Next Door for the first time about a week ago. I've watched it probably 6 times since. (Well, not all of it...just every damn scene Danielle is in). I gave the movie 9 stars but it's probably not that good. It's difficult to gauge because I am so hopelessly distracted by and in love with Elisha Cuthbert's Danielle. Every single second she is in it is absolute gold. It is without a doubt the hottest female character created in the history of film and one of the most underrated performances I've ever seen by an actress. Danielle is the perfect woman. An ex-porn star looking to turn her life around that falls for a nice guy that is the opposite of the guys she's probably been with. What guy hasn't fantasized about the perfect scenario?So Elisha is hot. That's obvious. She's flawless at this point in her career. But a lot of credit goes to the director for shooting her in a way where every guy in the world watching her will fall in love with her. Make no mistake, this isn't about just some 10/10 girl in a film looking hot. It's the perfect girl created perfectly by an outstanding actress at the peak of her incredible beauty. Elisha does so much with the role that is somewhat passive and subtle. Everyone talks about the ""Do you wanna F+++ me"" and the usual scenes, but there's so much else she does right. The way she kisses his hand when they're dancing at the prom. The way she says, near tears, ""I would love to"" when he asks her to the prom. Her extreme sadness when he takes her to the hotel room. ""So this is what you think of me"". It's all so perfectly done by Elisha Cuthbert. Her facial expressions, her eyes. I'm mesmerized. I know I am not alone. I have read comments on various forums, YouTube, etc. It's an inexplicable feeling many seem to have. I feel great while watching it, but feel kind of sad and depressed when I'm done. I call this affliction Elishatism. ;-) The last couple times I have watched it I actually cried, and I never cry---and it's so hard to put into words what it is.. I guess I would best describe it as this feeling of seeing something/someone so perfect, so beautiful, so flawless, but knowing its not attainable or real. I have become obsessed with a fictional character that is 14 years old. It's totally nuts. Knowing I'm not alone is helpful though.
Oh the film? This is not just another teen sex comedy. This film has outstanding acting and an amazing genuine ""feel"" to it where you feel like you're watching a genuine realistic romance unfold, but it probably doesn't deserve 9 stars. There's a lot done very well but a lot wrong with it. The most frustrating and excruciating thing wrong is that after about halfway through, Danielle's screen time disappears. The greatest asset this film has is Elisha's Danielle.The plot line with Spoilers: Danielle falls for Matthew an average high school senior, who's got a great heart, but hasn't lived life. Matthew is played perfectly by Emile Hirsch, who deserves a lot of credit, but is completely overshadowed by Elisha Cuthbert. The romance happens, then he discovers she''s a porn star, screws up by treating her like a porn star, she runs away, he goes and saves her, she comes back. This is only halfway through the film at this point. The romance was extremely rushed. The last half of this film is where it goes totally sideways. There's a lot of stuff happening that centers more on Matthew, with Danielle just watching and cheering him on. I would have loved to see the romance build slowly throughout the film with a lot more development of Danielle's character. Where did she come from? Why a porn star? What is with her family or parents? None of that is explored. She's just this mysterious beautiful porn star. There's so mush more that could have been done surrounding her character, their romance, etc.Elisha Cuthbert is fantastic with what the script gives her. The first half she's assertive in a really hot way, kind of taking control of Matthew, and showing him how to live life. After Matthew has brought her back from Vegas, the character of Danielle begins to morph into someone very sweet and vulnerable. You see how in love with Matthew she is and she seems to be a bit more submissive. The best word is vulnerable. You see that side of her in the end in many waysWhen Danielle and Matthew finally have sex, I think there's a subtle thing going on in that Danielle is having sex for the first time with someone she cares about. Her facial expressions show me that she's feeling things she's never felt. It's really beautiful in my eyes and Elisha did such an amazing job with that..Again, that's the agonizing part of this film. There's so much done right, and so many great scenes, and great lines, but there's so many flaws and God I wish they took advantage of Elisha Cuthbert's performance more. Elisha, thank you for this performance. A lot of us appreciate it for the depth that I think you were going for. You are a star and you're beautiful. This film is a treasure because of you",The Girl Next Door

408,gabe51,You Gotta Go!,10,2 May 2004,"So I've been bringing a different friend to the theater every weekend to see this movie.  It hasn't received a bunch of hype and it looks as though many critics aren't fully appreciating this film.  I had seen the trailer online months ago and was looking forward to seeing it just because of the ""carrot on a stick"" T&A factor (hey, I can be honest with myself) and the oh-so-cute Elisha Cuthbert.But then the release date was pushed (and then again, if I remember correctly) so it wasn't until I was killing some time and saw it was playing as a sneak preview one weekend that I finally got to see it.  I gotta tell you, I wasn't expecting much in the way of story or plot... or even acting, just some cheap jokes that hopefully be worth my $9 and to see what it could have been like if a porn star had moved in next door (cruel fate!).Man, was I surprised!  I haven't laughed that hard in a theater in a long time.  And rather than just showcasing hot chicks as porn stars or objects it reminded me of what it was like to have a crush and fall in love back in high school (with a little added fantasy factor).  I left that theater feeling really great and with renewed faith that ""teen sex comedies"" can contain a real sense of romance rather than just ""poop and fart"" jokes.So I've been doing my part to make sure I get as many people as I can to check it out and so far they've all loved it!  I want to make sure that Hollywood makes more of these kind of movies and less of those ""gross-out comedies"".  So...  You Gotta Go!",The Girl Next Door

First off, Elisha Cuthbert is my new girlfriend.  She was absolutely sexy, and charming in this movie. Matt's friend Eli was hysterical throughout the movie.  Overall this movie was great.  This movie is perfect for any occasion. Although a bit cliche love/teen movie at times, I highly recommend this movie to any and everyone.",The Girl Next Door
410,earle-5,A completely unconvincing lead character,4,16 April 2004,"The Girl Next Door has some potential at the onset, but that quickly faded after the first 30 minutes or so.  It basically degenerates into a mess by the end with completely unconvincing character decisions.  My main argument is that Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) makes such stupid decisions throughout the movie that I found myself not caring anymore about him or about what he was trying to do.SPOILERSFirst of all, his decision to take Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) to a cheap motel, get her drunk and then have sex with her just because he found out she used to be a porn star completely goes against what his character is supposed to be about.  I thought he cared about this girl?  I thought he was falling in love with her?Secondly, the way he just goes along with Kelly (Timothy Olyphant) when he drags him out of school is simply ridiculous.  Matthew knew this guy was dangerous, so why just get in the car and go who-knows-where with him?  He had the protection of being in school.  He could have used that to his advantage.  Back when I was in high school, it wasn't that easy for a student to get abducted right from the middle of a class, for heaven's sake! What kind of teacher just allows some disheveled older male to snatch a kid right from his desk??Thirdly, after Kelly punches Matthew in the car, he gives him some pills for the ""swelling"" that he just caused him.  Give me a break.  What idiot just takes some white pill given to him by some unstable moron?  He could have given him rat poison for goodness sake.  He should consider himself lucky that is was only Ecstasy.  This guy is supposed to be the school president that is up for a prestigious scholarship.  I figured this meant he had some brains in his head.  I guess not.There are other scenes in this movie that demonstrate complete stupidity as well, like the second scene in the bank where Matthew finds out that all the money has been withdrawn illegally by Kelly.  What kind of bank makes a mistake like that?  I wouldn't want to keep my money there!  Also, there is much more due process that would have taken effect in the bank as soon as this HUGE error was discovered.On the good side, the film starts out promising (as I said earlier) and the chemistry between Matthew and Danielle worked well.  That should have been explored a whole lot more.  Elisha Cuthbert looked stunning and has real screen presence.  Let's hope her next movie has more believable characters around her and a better script.",The Girl Next Door

At first I thought it was gonna be just another teen movie, and DAMN - it surprised me alot. This movie sure gave a lot of funny scenes. And, definetely, some touching scenes. A great romantic comedy 2 be seen here. The soundtrack is pretty good also, too bad it didn't include the single from David Grey - ""This Years Love"" (from the first kiss, and limo scenes). I would recommend this movie definetely. I have 2 say that it is one of my favorite movies I've seen, too bad it didn't make it top 5 of the week, but ppl should've give it a chance, I bet they would've find this movie pretty interesting and good.",The Girl Next Door

There wasn't much of a fuss about it so i didn't really think anything of it until my friends and I decided to go check it out.  It turned out to be amazing.  The character Eli's one liners were very funny and Elisha Cuthbert looked amazing.  It did have some crazy ideas that are outlandish.  Also the fact that the ""producer"", Kelly, is like thirty six and Danielle is only 19 and they dated.  Other than that I would say this was a very good movie and very funny.  If you pay attention to Eli he says some hilarious things.  I would definitley recommend this too any teenager looking for a good movie to see on a Friday night.",The Girl Next Door
413,romanianprincess,Actually better than it looks,10,19 April 2004,"I went into this movie thinking it would, well, suck.  I thought the whole situation was going to be far fetched.  Actually, if you can believe that an ex-porn star would move next to a lonely teenager, then the rest of the movie is pretty easy to go along with.The actors, for once, act like high school kids.  Emile Hirsch does a great job portraying a nervous teen trying to get the girl.  He is what most high school boys are: nervous most of the time, trying to act cool, trying to learn how to approach a girl, and worrying about college.
This movie really took me by surprise.  It is a sweet, romantic, and funny story about a boy who falls for a girl and learns that he'll do anything for her because ""the juice is worth the squeeze"".",The Girl Next Door

415,MarkArmstrong,It's A Little Funny,9,2 May 2004,"Almost the polar opposite of Walking Tall, this was a movie that at nearly 2 hours, could have easily had 20 minutes knocked off of it without hurting the plot at all. I found the movie good in a lot of ways, but like many others, felt it dragged at a near stop pace a few times.Elisha Cuthbert is smokin', but that's not enough to get a good rating, I actually felt that Emile Hirsch showed talent in the movie, and could be a breakout star in the next few years.The plot was fine, if not a take on Risky Buisness, but everything's a remake these days, so that's fine.The thing that got me hooked personally, is that Hirsch looks like you're normal kid next door really, and that's why it made you feel for him, when everything went wrong (at least at the beginning, when things were still somewhat realistic)Anyways, This movie gets the Old B-... It was good, but not Great, although I wouldn't be as harsh with it as far as being a box office bomb. It did respectable compared to other Teen Movies so far this year (Eurotrip, Perfect Score)",The Girl Next Door
416,berko-1,bad film about a geek and there is also a female porn star,1,4 May 2004,"To make it short, this was the worst movie I've seen in a long time; very predictable, in the end the geek turned into the school hero and became a millionaire? Not to forget, there is also a porn star who becomes his girl-friend, triggered his changes or the other way around and in the second half is only there to be the good looking part. This movie has no charm as Pretty Woman, no cool dialogues as e.g. Kill Bill 2 (even though it tries-squeeze the juice?) and the love story is lame (why would the porn queen go for the school boy-does this really change her life to the better?). If you're not 17 and dreaming of ... with a porn star I cannot recommend to watch this film.",The Girl Next Door
417,tagalog,real trouble starts after you got the girl,8,7 July 2004,"I really liked that in this film the brainy guy gets the girl early on, and then the trouble starts, instead of being kept in the edge with stupid little twists like in so many other teen comedies. The hard part is holding on to something despite obstacles and this movie captures that pretty well.The characters don't overextend. Even with some success early on, they don't grow into jocks all of a sudden but keep their weaknesses to the end, fighting in their own way. This, to me, is also the message at the end. Retaliation is not necessary, ""not caring"" (about the opinions of others) is whats really cool.I also liked the cast. They are not the greatest actors on earth, but they do their job well. ""The Girl next Door"" is hot :)",The Girl Next Door
418,sexylala,A sweet and naughty movie,10,16 July 2004,"I loved this movie, because it was sweet, funny and naughty! It started out good, no bad jokes and it lasted through the whole movie. You never know what is gonna happen next, never a boring moment. Matt, the main char in this movie, is like the person who never do anything wrong, like he says himself ""a f***ing boyscout"".This is until he meets Danielle, the girl next door.. She is this sweet and very good looking girl. But (for some people) she got a bad history she is trying to escape from. And this is the beginning of his morally downfall...The bonus in this movie, is that if you don't know what love is, then listen to him speaking about ""Moral fiber"". Now all my single friends wants to find his/hers ""Moral fiber"".So if you going to see a good movie, make it ""The Girl Next Door"", it's worth it!",The Girl Next Door

You meet some really cool people, you can enter to a adult film festival and enjoy the company of real porn stars, wow what a flick!Well I'm not a porn fan but this movie really opened my eyes. It has some moments that you may compare with your childhood. Really funny2 thumbs up!!!!",The Girl Next Door
420,enigmor,"Good, unclean fun!",10,30 July 2004,"I set up an IMDb account mainly because i wanted to air my feelings about this movie after watching it recently. When a little unhappy i hired this film out and gave it a chance, despite my recent cynicism towards the American teen-flick genre. However, after a good half an hour of watching this movie a began to see that a little more time had been taken to make this movie stand out from others, this was down to several factors; 1) the film stars no real ""A-List celebrities"", not only giving new actors a chance to show how good they really are, but giving you a clean view of the role they had undertaken for this movie, in transition to other actors, i.e Sean William Scott, spending the entirety of any post-American Pie movie he's starred in, NOT to be like Stifler. 2) the story. It's well written, with subtle plot twists, allowing for you to sometimes spot whats about to happen before it does, and though some people would say thats a negative, though it leaves me feeling quite pleased with myself. 3) talented, young actors. The supporting acting done by Matthew Kidman's (Emile Hirsche) two best friends, managing to play nervous, uncomfortable, and studd. Great stuff This film comes highly recommended on so many levels, it will make you laugh (possibly extremely hard), it will shock and it will interest you greatly, and of course the ridiculously attractive Elisha Cuthbert stars. I give it:9/10",The Girl Next Door
421,alvarezg,Come guys it was excellent,10,1 August 2004,"hey guys did you see the director comment on ""Behind The scenes""? He said that if you know Elisha Cuthbert you'd say she is nice, but when you see the movie, you would be enchanted by the character and you'd really get your heart melted, AND THAT IS WHAT SHE DID. I think Elisha was great on this film, and i wasn't even registered in this site but i really wanted to put my comment here, cause many people here say that this movie sucks... YOUR WRONG, if you haven't watched it yet please DO, its worth the ride, the movie has a real interesting scrip and its definitely not a ""Scary movie"" or ""Not another teen movie"" crap. There where some really good actors here and everyone that thinks that good actors only appear on dramas your wrong, everyone dit a great job and i really think this is a great movie, fun, some edgy parts and WATCH IT!!!!!!!!!Although its a reaaaaaaaally good movie i wouldn't see it twice... cause is not that kind of movie, but you'll enjoy it, i gave it a 10 on a teenager comedy scale, many people here don't but a ten to a comedy cause they think they are good critics... well, sometimes you got to reward a good fun movie, that's worth it of your time and it will entertain you for sure....watch it guys, good script, good actors, good story, good movie!",The Girl Next Door
422,marius-birk,Can't stop watching it!,10,15 January 2017,"Okay so I was bored yesterday and was looking for a teen comedy movie. Then I stumbled upon ""The girl next door"" and thought yeah why not. Best teen romance-comedy movie I've ever seen. After watching it I fell in love with both the movie and the girl. Acting was on point, music was awesome and I would describe it as a feel-good movie. Very touching and some might react totally different. All in all one of my favorite movies of all time and so underrated! Much better than American Pie and many of the other high school comedies. This is a must watch movie for us teenagers out there. There is only one last thing to say. ""The juice was worth the squeeze""",The Girl Next Door
423,One_Too,good movie done in risky context,7,11 August 2004,"I thought that this movie was going to be foolish but not all that bad... I was wrong and i was right... The movie was foolish in some respects, but it is a comedy and a sort of teen flick in the fact that these are teens (it wouldn't have worked very well with just adults anyway). I must say that the foolishness is done well in that it wasn't out of placeI believe the director and writers snuck a real movie in there somewhere.. This movie game me the feeling I got when I watched ""almost famous"" for the first time... It's no where near the caliber of that film but it does a good job of mixing those elements with the elements of a basic teen comedy. This is a story of finding your self in life as in 'Almost Famous'I liked that it did the bully thing but it was not with the expected jocks that are always the bully and you did not see the characters back down so quickly only to muscle enough strength later... This was a gradual approach to man hood and a brave step forward... Anyway enough rambling... 7/10P.S. this is my first post after registering today..

424,simon-538,Good.. for the first 25 minutes,4,14 August 2004,"""Girl next door"" comes off as a good movie, when watching the first 25 minutes. Editing, soundtrack and camera work makes it stand out from other teenybopper flicks, by looking somewhat more professional.The acting is OK and the storyline is passable and somewhat captivating. It seems as if the story is about the guy and this girl falling in love and having to overcome some problems, including the usual comic relief, which could actually have become quite a good movie. Then, for some odd reason about 25 minutes into this abomination, the whole storyline spirals into a farce with a plot that's been used so many times before, it hurts.All of a sudden, the girl almost disappears from the script leaving the the main male character behind with (ofcourse) his two nerdy friends, who's never gotten laid, and then... well, and then it seems the director tries to kill off this movie in the best way possible, 'cus he knows he messed up. This results in a long and booooooring movie that should've never left the paper it was written on. For the last 30 minutes of this flick, you keep thinking ""ok, it HAS to end now"", but noooo, somehow it keeps going on and on and on...Bad plot, bad acting, bad writing, bad directing, bad editing, in fact it all sucks.. except for the soundtrack which was very well compiled, but not really suited for a silly movie like this.",The Girl Next Door

The acting is good too, and there many funny one-liners. Everybody does a good job here. The actors, the director, the producers.

Before this flick I never even heard of Elisha Cuthbert or Emile Hirsch, and after wards i have found that they are awesome at acting. I mean, they really convinced me they were a couple in the movie.The entire plot of the movie impressed me (And don't think because i'm a ""horny"" teenager, that the porn theme is what got my attention.) I believe he did a good job in directing the whole Girl Next door theme and making the movie really enjoyable with the equal romance and comedy.

For a long time I was mesmerized by that movie, like most young men at the time.2004 I saw The Girl Next Door when it was released, and I had no idea what it was about...at all! About half way through, however, I started to think and compare this movie to Risky Business.The music....the attitude (fuck it) I mean....this was just an updated version. Well when the porn stars came on board to shoot the video and everything was spinning out of control...I knew this movie was either a hack...or a tribute.The movie was not quite as fun as Risky Business....the characters were not built up as strong, especially the lead. But I really liked this movie! It still makes you feel good, and wish that you were the young man in question. After all...I think most young men, and older, have fantasized about having a porn star fall in love with them.Good movie!!!",The Girl Next Door
428,julespecnard,A decent feel-good movie,6,19 June 2005,"As most reviewers explained, I knew what I was to come upon when I went to see this film. Since I was with my friends, whom were mostly guys, the major after-view conversation topic was Elisha Cuthbert's fine physical traits. This young lady is truly beautiful. But, one night, the cable-T.V. not bearing a great choice of feature films, I chose to watch this one, again, instead of terrible movies like The Matrix Revolutions or The Fast And The Furious.Although this takes me unto a rather personal point of view, I viewed this re-run during a period of sore depression, and this movie undoubtedly cured it, at least for the night.The story, which evolved into a simplistic script, not difficult to either dish out or dish in, gives the audience a great impression of deja-vu, although unlike most movies that are based on stories that bear this trait, this one contained a story that ""always seems to work"".:::SPOILERS AHEAD:::The story is, well, a story like others, but a simple one. This clean-cut teen whose scholarship life is based on work, finds his neighboring house being newly inhabited by a coming-out-of-nowhere angelic girl. A friendship builds on that. But false moves executed by the male protagonist chases off the girl, who happens to be a porn star. The fight to get her back begins. Now, of course, there is a main enemy here, whom is the girl's producer. The first battle is lost by our hero, but the next and last one, tied up with decent plot twists, is, on the other hand, won, and followed by what might be one of the most delightful and pain-relieving sexual scenes I have seen on film (adult films set aside).Of course, the end, as most external reviewers like Rolling Stone Magazine have put it, is ""preposterously"" implausible. But, that being said, it really, in my point of view, relieves you of stress or pain, all in all becoming a visual aqua-seltzer. But the bad taste of the latter can be compared to the many shortcomings of the technical core of the picture.Although many of the actors' flaws are unnoticed, well, we are not, as spectators, accompanied by Russell Crowe, Robert De Niro, or Jack Nicholson. But, what the heck? These young actors(the ones in pic) pretty much know there stuff, and are not totally incompetent, actually are far from it(except maybe for one of the principal male protagonist's friends, Eli).So, this movie is not a compelling one, certainly not an ""oscar-buzz"", and not part of art- house cinema. It is simply a movie that, by its common story and script, may seem and is, only in more rated-R way, a been-seen pain-killer, depending on one's taste for story lines. Why don't I give it 5 or under? Well because I didn't really get bored, and because, although the laughs are scattered, they are present when they occur, and finally because the cinematography isn't amateurish or boring, it is actually quite surprising. Why didn't I give it over 6? Well, unless we are provocative, we all know why, don't we?",The Girl Next Door
429,adzling7,Much better than expected,7,30 September 2004,"I expected some clichéd teen movie garbage, but this movie was a pleasant surprise. I was impressed almost immediately by the high school scene at the beginning; it seemed much more realistic than most attempts at portraying a typical American high school. The actors actually looked like they could be in high school. The acting in the movie was good, and the dialogue was, for the most part, original and believable. Timothy Olyphant was great as always, and Emile Hirsch did a fine job in his first major role. The movie dealt with serious issues with equal flair as it did not-so serious ones, which is often very tough to do. The best part of the movie, however, was Elisha Cuthbert. She played her character extremely well (a big departure from 24) and looked amazing in every scene. I can't remember the last time I saw an actress as beautiful as she is. Definitely see this movie.",The Girl Next Door
430,Meloman_S,Great film,8,3 October 2004,"As a matter of fact, in the beginning I had no desire to watch this film, because I was expecting some new American stupid teen-comedy, but, finally, this is turned to be one of the coolest and most interesting romantic films I have ever seen. I actually like this film because of such beautiful girl as Elisha Cuthbert, who took really hard role to be performed with passion and devotion. Matthew's character looks familiar to many American and European teens. He did not miss his once-in-a-life chance to meet his ideal girl",The Girl Next Door
431,gmg4,"Fun, easy going, feel good film. A rom com with an edge.",10,15 October 2004,"I first watched this movie about a week after it was released in the uk. Initially i was a little worried ""not another rom-com"" but i was more than pleasantly surprised i have to say. I am no denying the teenage roots to the flick, but i am sure that all ages could relate to some parts of the film. High school, the jocks, the geeks the girls. I wasn't going in expecting too much but when i finally pressed the stop button on my DVD at the end of the film i felt happy, and if i'm not very much mistaken that is what these type of film is all about. I didn't expect a shakespearean tragedy instead i got a light, feel - good, slightly adult film.If you like the American pie, road trip, not another teen movie genre of film then you will love this, but i feel there is an edge to this film that those other out and out funny films don't have, there is a definite sentiment that the director tries to portray here and i think he wins. You could watch this film with your friends, girlfriends, boyfriend but perhaps not your parents.If this film doesn't leave you feeling something i'll be surprised. Both the leads are great, and there are subtleties in their performances to look out for. so rent it, buy it and i promise you'll have a chuckle, a chortle, a snigger or even a guffaw. It left me feeling tingly and thinking of those high school days - the rose coloured glasses firmly in place",The Girl Next Door

I'm in drama school at the mo hopefully try to get in a few auditions but i would love to have been a part of it it was a great film and the actors and actresses were great. so if you ever make a second film just email me audition dates please. You probably hear this all the time but Elisha Cuthburt WOW it must of been great working with her i have seen her in a few films and she's a talented actress she will go far and also Emile Hirsch was fantastic too what a lucky man I'm coming to America this year or next just to get away from the UK my dream was to be an actor a couple of my friends are actors and i want to follow them so very well done for making a great film and hopefully ill see you all soon many thanks for taking the time to read this comment from Stuart Evenden,The Girl Next Door
433,rfriedrich9,Best movie I've seen,10,24 October 2004,"this movies was so good because it come from like my point of view a teenagers view and really showed how tough it is to grow up if u don't take changes. Sometimes you have to risk everything for something or someone you want thats what this movie was all about someone that loved someone and risked his whole future for a great girl. I like how they created the setting of it to. Emile Hirsch was in high school and Elisha Cuthbert had already had been out for a year and they lived right next door to each other. ME personally i think Elisha Cuthbert is the hot girl out there right now. She look so hot in this movie the people that worked with her did a great job. The two most important things that came to me were the way Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert looked at each other through out the whole movie and the music. Over all i think this movie was the best movie i've seen because it came from a teenagers point of view. They need to make more movies like THE GIRL NEXT DOOR!

Elisha Cuthbert represents everything in the world that is beauty. If you watch this movie as many times as i did you will not be able to grasp the beauty of Ms, Cuthberts reality SHE IS THIS MOVIE, I would pay bundles of dollars to see Ms. Cuthbert in person just because this movie had showed me her true acting talent.As ""Mr.Moo"" had said in his earlier review, this movie may at first look as just a crude movie directed towards teenagers , but Mr. moo is obviously and blantently a homosexual. But this man as a very strange distorted view on reality. This movie contains multiple ""Funny HaHa's"" and made me chortle a plethora of times. I believe that the mix of very sexy women (Elisha Cuthbert) and the hilarious jokes makes this movie very delightful to watch.But as i keep saying, Cuthbert isn't the only thing in this movie that makes it able to be watched, the constant sexual oriented jokes and the Character Eli are absolutely hilarious.

She had a glow that made the entire movie flow the way i had never seen before. I watched this movie back when it first came out and i wanted to see it again and again and again and i didn't know why. I believe that this is a very good movie and one i'll always remember.

It got some romance , some action and some reality . It is a wonderful story and I really liked it . Only one thing I don't like is the end . it is a little bit weird . Hopefully you (Elisha ) will read this . You were really hot . And if someone else who know Kate Upton Ask her to make a film , like this one.This is a great film .(Some days later)Sorry Kate Upton I've been wrong ,you are so hot . And you are so beautiful .

This movie is like juice: worth the squeeze. The movie contains more than the sight of Elisha Cuthbert in sexy lingerie. Just these shots are worth viewing the movie.

My tag line choice would be: ""Always consider: is the juice worth the squeeze."", one of the quotes I took with me in further life. Saw some nice plot twists I didn't see coming.

I hadn't seen any trailers or posters for it and usually the liner notes on the cases, be it VHS or DVD is usually a load of Pooh, so all I knew was that it was a romantic teen comedy and it stars a beautiful Elisha Cuthbert and one of my favorite actors Timothy Olyphant. Now usually I'm not into romantic teen comedies but the fact that Timothy Oliphant was in it got me to rent it. And to my great surprise I thought it was quite funny, a little bit sweet and a little grim on occasions. Emile and Elisha really seem to have something going on there that isn't often seen between young actors in a movie such as this, they just click and it seems sincere most of the time. Elisha is well known for her acting in the hit show 24, but I had never heard about Emile Hirsch, I think he'll be big in Hollywood sooner or later, that kid is very good in the movie!

The movie starts slowly, the plot evolves slightly but all this seems too fuzzy and politically correct. Actors do not reveal easily their intimate personalities due to bad or boring playing, and the movie fails to deliver a real vision of their relationships.Stéréotypes and clichés are omnipresent to such an extent that the atmosphere rendered seems totally unrealistic and improbable. While the movie seems to run forever, the ending, which is welcomed, is also a big disappointment, celebrating Hollywoodesque endings in the best manner possible.Nothing to see, please move along...",The Girl Next Door

There are loads of memorable lines in it like ""why do you think so much of me"", ""I don't know maybe I'm stupid""! There ain't as much jokes in it as I thought there would be but I think the writers made it more romantic. I have seen the movie a few times now and I still love it, I think the characters Kelly and Eli are the best and they have all the best lines too. Personally I would give this movie 10 out 0f 10 and its one of the best romantic movies I have ever seen and I recommend it to you lot who have not seen it!!! I got the unrated one so it has loads of extra features which is well worth the money, loads of people said the first half is good and then it starts to lags but personally I loved every minute of it and I never even got bored at all!!

And pure chick flicks (i.e. anything with that British twit who was brilliant in 4 Weddings and a Funeral but has sucked ever since) suck. But I was totally sucked in by this movie. I laughed, I cried (well, my eyes got a little watery). True, it's about high school kids trying to get laid. But it works. After all, high school kids can be involved in real drama that goes beyond Laguna Beach or 90210.I really recommend this move despite the superficial appearance that it might be a sappy or cheesy teen movie.

The couple are thrown obstacle after obstacle including Danille's ex-porn producer (Olyphant) who is a shining star in the film. The film combines real-life, romance, some comedy, and seriousness. Cuthbert's performance as the sweet, caring, and unknown Danille is great, and Hircsh's performance as the hard-working student focused more on his future than what happens in his life is stellar, Olyphant's performance is to die for his up beat comedy and serious talks are great and not to be reckoned with.All in all the movie was great and I could watch it over and over again.10/10 stars",The Girl Next Door

Well written and almost perfectly acted. The plot is cute and entertaining and all the set ups pay off very well, not to mention that Elisha Cuthbert has never been hotter (and probably never will be again). This movie puts a new spin on romantic comedy while keeping the audience's attention through many suspenseful subplots. If you don't expect much, this film will blow you away. If you go in thinking it's one of the best teen romantic comedies out there, you'll still end up happy. Rent it, buy it, worship it....at least buy it.",The Girl Next Door
449,luke-harris121,"2 Reviews, 11 Years Apart - NOSTALGIA",8,28 September 2021,"I felt compelled to review this movie after watching it last night on Netflix after 11 years...
2010 - Movies like this were still being churned out during the golden age of American Sex Comedies & Coming of Age genres, categories of film which would seemingly die out as social constructs changed, and cultures evolved.Films such as American Pie, or Road Trip, or The Girl Next Door provided a great deal of escapism for many young folks including myself - Oh to experience some of the suburban Americana stereotypes: Sorority/fraternity parties, heading to the beach after or even during class, large houses on peaceful and leafy streets, all the mums are milfs and all the girls are hot. Quintessential scenes in these films where women would reveal their assets after some drunken game or dare... you didn't know exactly when it was coming, you just knew it was! Sex was new, funny, exploratory, intriguing.Let's add Elisha Cuthbert to this mix as Danielle - she's perfection in this film, every young mans dream woman. Her cuteness and facial expressions are almost overwhelming, her natural features somewhat angelic - Everyone watching at this point has assumed the role of Emile Hirsch's, Matthew, boys and girls alike, and no one actually has a choice... at this point they we've been hypnotised. Danielle is so excruciatingly yet nonchalantly beautiful that you wonder how to find this woman in life - you're jealous of Matthew, you want this exact scenario to happen to you! It hurts that it hasn't
The movie rolls on and at this point I didn't care much about the things I usually do when I analyse a film: the cinematography, the direction, the acting, mis en scene etc. I'm just too enamoured with the relationship between the main characters, I'm enthralled with the escapism.I watch the film several times in search for that same level of escapism.2021 - I had thought about this film from time to time over several years however wasn't particularly interested in covering old ground from years before - I saw it pop up on Netflix and decided to put it on... what I then experienced was extreme nostalgia for a least the first half of the film.I found myself in a bittersweet state of mind, yearning for a time that once was, when things were easier, when time was on my side, when the inevitable pressures and stresses of life hadn't yet kicked in.This film will remain a cult classic in my opinion due to Danielle and Matthews relationship - Matthew is a handsome guy but Danielle was breath-taking, however re-watching this film with a more critical head, it could have been an exceptional film if the romantic story had expanded more dramatically rather than comedically - due to the teen movie element, some of the comedic elements had to rely on increasingly implausible scenes to allow the juvenile jokes to work - the second half of the film in particular is extraordinarily nonsensical which removes some of the nuanced sweetness previously developed by the characters.However, the movie pretty much had to be made the way it was, it was a sign of the times... only watching again now provides a particular level of nostalgia that we might not otherwise have had.So, in essence, this film is not actually very technically good, however it doesn't need to be... this is one of those films which gives you a feeling rather than having to critically analyse - in my case nostalgia.",The Girl Next Door

Elisha Cuthbert is the bomb. she is after seeing this movie my favorites actress. i hope to see her in the future. if she reads this, if you break up with your fiancé i am always free. you are 6 years older then me but age is only a number. this is movie is the one of or the best movies of all time and it will be around for a while. Elisha plays her part exceptionally well. everyone has to see the movie. The other characters are pretty good. the movie is well worth seeing and i would personally recommend it for the world to buy. in order to watch the film you need a fairly open mind. a lot of twists occur. the movie is more a drama film then any and it kept me on the edge of my seat from the very start. the movie is one that will make you laugh and also make you a bit sad with the occurrences that happen. you wont be disappointed when you buy this film. this film should be still at the top. to finish up this movie is one where you will not be disappointed. it is a crazy movie where at every corner their is a surprise.Bye guys. everyone buy or at least see the film Bye by the way Elisha is HOT!!!!",The Girl Next Door

Elisha Cuthbert does the best role I have seen in a lifetime. This movie can not be compared to ""just any other teen movie"". The movie has a lot of great viewpoints, like the one about ordinairy ""uncool"" people. The characters are very ""thought out"", and I love that sentence, ""You have to know if the juice is worth the squeeze"". Great work by the director, we also see a whole new side to Elisha Cuthbert as an actor. Every scene contains a new climax, its a continuing one. I have seen the movie five times now, and every time is like a new experience. See the movie!! Highly recommended!",The Girl Next Door
455,mwor05,Most Misunderstood Movie I Have Ever Seen,10,19 January 2007,"First off this movie was one of the worse marketed movies by a studio ever. They made it out to be a teen sex comedy which it is truly not. It has its laughs but this movie is so much more.The movie is about repression and then having that repression broken once you fall in love for the first time. Matthew is a kid who has never taken a risk in his life and has always done the thing people expected of him. Enter Danielle, the girl next door, who just gets Matthew is so many ways. She releases him from the binds that have enclosed him all his life and as the movie goes along we see what love is in its finest form. These characters really are in love and the actors who play them (Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert) play their performances to perfection, especially Cuthbert.All and all i will recommend this movie to anyone. It is truly the new Risky Business.",The Girl Next Door
456,erika-64,better than I expected,8,11 November 2005,"Elisha Cuthbert's portrayal of the character Danielle was much more sensitive and realistic than I had expected. The entire movie, while having its necessary idiotic moments and ridiculous plot, was filled with more nuance and tenderness than I had thought possible from this plot and genre. Most romantic comedies, and certainly most movies about the adult film industry, are hesitant to deal with the shattered and abused souls, manipulation, coercion, and youth of the female adult film stars. Elisha and the director of the film, Luke Greenfield, manage to make a sexy, funny, wholly enjoyable film while not shying away from the tragedies of Danielle's personal history. Kudos to the cast and directors for pulling this off.",The Girl Next Door
457,jwinten-1,The movie next door,8,6 May 2006,"An enticing movie, The Girl Next Door is a story involving the typical loser, Matthew Kidman, played by Emile Hirsch and ""Danielle"", played by Elisha Cuthbert.Danielle is the girl next door, the ex pornography star who decides that the ordinary life is the good life, while Matthew is the affixed neighbour who falls in love at first sight.Character development is strong, helping to maintain director Luke Greenfield's steady pace. We see the extension of supporting actors Chris Marquette and Paul Dano, who provide much needed humour and support to Hirsch.Overall, this film presents a situation which most would find difficult to manage. It explores the pornography industry as perhaps a place of loneliness and misunderstanding, and by and large I would recommend anyone who is able to appreciate such themes to see this film.",The Girl Next Door
458,bjarkehn,Emile Hirsh + Elisha Cutburth .. Wish they was a truly couple... (I want this too!),10,31 July 2015,"Had they ever dated each other for real before ---> in my opinion they should be a couple for real? They love and connection between them is so real and demonstrates the movie as one of the best! or is it just so real/unique and wonderful in the film.I know the movie is more than 10 years old. But for me is this movie the best romantic comedy film ever. I think its because of the relationship between Matthew and Danielle(Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cutburth) When i see this movie. I try'll to think about them as a couple, but that's not all! I'll dreaming about to have this relationship by myself. Not because she's hot or dirty or something. More or less their connection and how they both are for each other, like they are as one person. It feels so good and so complete. I know as everybody else it's just a movie. But seriously .. I can't get enough of them(especially where we see them hanging out a lot and where it is more about them as a couple) and wish the film was much longer,only because of their relationship to each other. - I want their relationship!! Its so truly and perfect. Is there any of you? who has the same feeling about this movie? I like the concept and their small jokes. But what's really takes my attention is their relationship between each other. Its so real and so great. They are truly their both soul-mates in this movie. I love especially that the relationship is not all about ""the man who would do anything for the girl"" but also that Danielle is helpful and gives all for her ""new younger man/boyfriend"" in her life. They give everything for each other. Its not like all other Romantic films, where the man are fighting the girl back. Its mutual emotions and help from both.I want this film/romantic show as my own. Please subscribe or give a comment. sorry for my English grammar, I'm not English and were quickly to write my opinion.I Could use a second movie.. ha ha just to see this truly love on film again. It's my first love to a romantic film at all. And I usually hate these type of films.Thank you for your attention, hopefully you guys wants to give a comment. Or perhaps Agree with me.",The Girl Next Door

460,sml_town_grl_in_big_city,I don't get it...,2,8 July 2005,"Wow - I don't understand how this movie got so many positive reviews. I personally believe this is one of, if not the, worst movies I have EVER seen. The plot is totally unbelievable, and the main character reminded me way too much of a Fred Savage wannabe.The movie is also super complicated: I've singled out about 7 different plots - that's incredible! The first half of the movie was OK, in an American Pie sort of way, but the rest was just added on cheese. Every time you think the movie will end, it just keeps ON GOING - like forever! I think I preferred Chris Marquette and Paul Dano's acting than Emile Hirsch's - he just didn't seem in his element. I seriously was just waiting for a Wonder Years voice-over at almost every scene of the movie.And the imagined scenes were just too complicated and clumsy for this movie... Leave those to Scrubs, where they know how to make it work.All in all, yes, Elisha super hot (as all the other reviewers needed to point out), but that doesn't make the movie work.",The Girl Next Door
461,ferdiaob,Definitely Not Another Teen Movie,9,15 July 2005,"In a world wrought with unoriginal and humor-lacking teen movies, The Girl Next Door provides a beacon of light. The director's hardest battle was to insure that although 90% of the cast are teenagers, that this movie should not be labeled as a teen comedy.The first comparison that should be made between your average Hollywood teen offering and this movie is the humor. Some movies (American Pie 1, Road Trip) are genuinely funny, but in a slapstick way. The Girl Next Door provides more intelligent jokes (Eli saying that Matthews's motel advances towards Danielle was a little forthcoming, for instance).Even after this fact is acknowledged, it is still tempting to accuse The Girl Next Door of being a teen movie, but suddenly the thought springs to mind. ""Hang on; did that movie have a story line?"" And the answer is of course ""too right it did"". The story line revolves around a life changing loss of innocence for: primarily, Matthew and Danielle, and secondarily: Eli and Klits.Matthew starts the movie in a tether of his scholarship acquirement's, he spends hours studying and speech revising. Enter Danielle, in the space of 2 weeks she turns Matthew from a text book geek, into the king of the school (I refer of course to his control over the jocks on prom night.). Danielle, for all her real world experience, is an emotional black hole. Matthew, in the movie breaks threw this, and Danielle ""makes love"" for the first time.Eli, the local porn king, thinks he (sexually) knows it all, however, even the slightest sexual conduct, and he turns and runs (i.e. The porn star asking Eli/Klitz to feel his girlfriends breasts). Klitz, like Matthew, is a text book nerd and lacks any confidence in his appearance, what so ever. With the help of April, he breaks through this, gaining a silent reputation for the prominence of his manhood.So let's compare these major story lines to some admitted teen movies. American Pie 2: The story line (singular) in this story is to go on vacation and get laid. WOW. Not exactly a feast for the thought. Road Trip: This time round the storyline (singular) is that a guy suddenly realizes that his pen pal is a girl and sets of on a several thousand mile trip to profess his undying love.. Rubbish.One similarity I am happy to point out between this work and the self-proclaimed teen movies, is that it has an excellent sound track. A few examples of the excellent choices in music would be David Gray's This Years Loving. This song perfectly matched the budding affections of Danielle and Matthew, both while they share their first kiss, and when there have sex for the first time. On a smaller scale Lapdance by NERD, perfectly captures the moment when the new and improved Matthew, strolls into the Prom and officially becomes the Godfather of the school. On the topic of the sound track, I could go on for pages, so ill just stop that now.The best movie to compare this piece to is Risky Business. You've all seen it I'm sure. The academically perfect Tom Cruise's parents do away for the weekend. And Cruise erupts. Going wild for the weekend, he dance around the house, pants-less (easily one of the most famous scenes in movie history) and more importantly (from a story line point of view), meets and falls in love with hooker Lana (Rebecca De Mornay). On comparison I preferred The Girl Next Door. The relationship between Hirsh/Cuthbert is far more convincing then that of Cruise/De Mornay, and more importantly, there was no real foundation for the change in Cruises character, whereas Matthew is forced out of his shell by the life-of-fun character of Danielle.Unfortunately, Risky Business is unshakable from it pillar as one of the best movies ever. But the Girl Next Door deserves to stand right up there beside is it.If you haven't seen this movie but have read this. Sorry., but go get the movie anyway, trust me, i didn't talk about, about 90% of the content of this masterpiece. If you have seen it, then I hope you agree with my synopsis.This movie is worthy of much more recognition then it is currently receiving. And ill bet that the reason is in the first eleven words of this review.",The Girl Next Door
462,Edward-140,best movie for a date with your girl,10,17 July 2005,"This movie was great for me because I recently graduated as well and it definitely indicates todays world of social class. A genuine genius who is only days away from receiving the scholarship of a lifetime is peer pressured by himself and others that's it over and just be free. Matthew (emlie) one night accidentally sees his new neighbor stripping and from there on is horrified but in love. Danielle (hottest girl in the world)*in my opinion, while watching this movie I swear I loved every aspect of her personality!"" thinks he's cute and starts to mess with him. He is falling in love with her slowly until a video of her job showed up. Matthews best friend Eli is a porn freak and discovers Danielle is a porn star. Matt can't believe it and is shocked to find out that Danielle's boss comes to town and takes her to the adult film convention and Kelly tells Matt to never come to her again cause it's ruining his money. Matt loves her so much he gets Klitz and Eli to go with him to the convention to tell Danielle he's sorry but instead, they get busted and Matt pisses Kelly off.

You can't know what will happen because what you expect is not going to happen. Especially the final part when the whole family and the guy from the university saw the video, I did hold my breath about the bad thing ahead. Fortunately, what happened was quite amazing.

To be honest, before I saw this film I had only seen her briefly in Love Actually but as her name appeared in the programme synopsis on Sky I decided it was worth a look.From the first time you see her she seems to express herself in such a natural way. The look on her face throughout the movie and in some scenes especially is so sincere she really brings the emotion of her character and the connection she has to Matthew to life.I know I am not saying much about the film which, in itself, I thought was good but the main reason to watch this film is to see what an amazing talent Elisha Cuthbert is. I hesitate to use the word 'actor' as her character is so natural I get the feeling she is just being herself. These days, actors are so full of themselves it's hard to tell where one stops and another starts. Elisha Cuthbert, on the other hand, is in a league of her own and I have a feeling as her success gets even greater that she will retain this quality by just keep on being herself.",The Girl Next Door

We laughed at something like every couple of minutes. Some of the funniest parts were probably when he's watching her getting undressed, when Eli and Klitz are watching porn together, When Kelly gives Mathew Ecstacy, and when Matthew steals the gold statue thats a weiner.

Next scene she unlocks the door; and he opens it; while the window is closed...The only thing which was a bit unclear was what finally happened with Kelly...

I don't understand Roger Ebert's review of the movie at all seeing that I thought Elisha Cuthbert played the role of Danielle extremely well. She was sexy and sweet and also added a little needed flair to the film. She had to nearly control Matt to help him break out of his shell. much like brad Pitt did for Edward Norton in fight club. This movie was funny yet it was somewhat a love story and something we all can relate to whether your still in school or not. although obviously this isn't your typical family movie I believe that it sends a message that we can all appreciate. It's what's on the inside that counts and that sometimes all we need is a little help to open up and realize our full potential.

Check this out.What happens when you bring a smart kid like Matthew and a ""porn star"" like Danielle and make them neighbors? Well, you get this film. It just shows that no matter how different, certain people complements others. The thing I enjoyed most is that the story captures and gets a firm grip on you while watching. You can't stop looking at Elisha Cuthbert and her ""hotness"". It has some cheesy scenes but its comic one's compensate for it. The plot is a bit unstable. But in all, it's good.

476,marvelljones,Definitely underrated,9,12 April 2006,"This movie exceeded my expectations. I expected a ""hey look at the hot chick with the dork"" teen crap movie. What I got was a movie that has depth and still retains its comedic edge. Elisha Cuthbert and Emile Hirsch are excellent together. Elisha Cuthbert does something I haven't seen for a while out of an actress: she acts with her eyes first, then the rest of her follows. Like the DVD extras said Emile Hirsch does this as well, but Elisha is definitely more adept at this. She is a very underrated actress, probably because she's gorgeous to such a great degree. I hope to see more of her in movie roles that don't concentrate so much on how good she looks.",The Girl Next Door
477,declennon,I was surprised...,9,27 December 2006,"First off, I will be the first to admit that I did not want to go see this movie in theaters. My wife with a little persuasion got me to go. At first I figured the only good thing about this movie would be to see some good old fashion teenage T&A. After seeing this movie I saw it for what it really was, a vessel for carrying a strong message. That message is to live life for life, and to leave nothing untested or undone. There are points where time is lost and you get the feeling that it looses its flow, but it quickly recovers and at the end delivers a come from nowhere knockout sucker punch. I am now proud to say that I own this movie and watch it regularly. I will say it's go a lot going for it, good looking women, good music, and a good story.",The Girl Next Door
478,screwthisplace,simply brilliant,10,29 January 2006,"with a great performance by all; this film, in my opinion, is simply the best of its genre.if u love it too; add me Elisha's performance along side Emile was great (they go together so well) characters seem free when togetherscrewthisplace@hotmail.comis Elisha anything like her character in 'the girl next door' in real life? looks like a really fun person to know.also Eli and Klits are a funny partnership (jousting scene is good) take my advice watch this film and if u don't like it you have bad taste and there is something wrong with you.despite the fact that people title this as a teen movie it is good for other ages and its humour is not slapstick, more slow, but you have to think about it( this does not stop it from being hilarious) Great soundtrack as well as good camera technique Elisha, why aren't you more famous in england",The Girl Next Door
479,yuchunz,Funny movie,9,8 February 2006,"This movie is so funny. It demonstrated a teenager's loving story with two cute actor/actress. Elisha Cuthbert is the most gorgeous actress I have ever been seen in my life. I cannot imagine such a beautiful would be a porn star. Anybody tell me why she is so hot? Definitely, Elisha did the good thing, without being naked in the play, just a lot of pictures making you assume she is naked. Kelly, Danielle's ex-boyfriend, is so atrocious, but another porn producer, Hugo, is more powerful than him. I think the only shortcoming of the movie is that it is not necessary to bring up a story about raising money for a Cambodian student to study in America, any other plot would have been better, I mean it is not understandable. Of course the director may have his own opinion. By the way, some pictures in the movie are kind of offensive such as those having sex in tape, it is not essential for the movie, I think.Another two friends of Matt are also had a great performance in the movie, this movie reminds me of what I looked like as high school student, doing whatever you want without thinking about the consequence and risk it at all. It is so closed to our real life. I cannot write anymore because I am going to be insane.",The Girl Next Door
