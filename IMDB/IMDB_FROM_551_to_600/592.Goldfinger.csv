0,MartinHafer,"Exceptional, but also heralding in some of the gadgetry that sank later Bond films",8,23 March 2008,"In the Ian Fleming novels, James Bond was not super-human nor did he run around with tons of ridiculous gadgets. He was more a spy and assassin--not a guy with amazing powers. While I loved DR. NO and FROM Russia WITH LOVE, GOLDFINGER is a sad film for me because it ushered in a trend in Bond films that I disliked--ridiculous gadgetry that got in the way of plot. Sure, it was fun watching Oddjob throwing his metallic hat, but it also was pretty stupid if you think about it. Additionally, having Goldfinger use a laser on Bond was just dumb. Like Dr. Evil's son suggests in the Austin Powers film, why not just put a bullet in his head and be done with it?!?! If you take away all the gadgets, the rest of the movie is very good and very exciting. Thanks to a long film with lots of twists and turns, it felt like a real adventure--very escapist and satisfying.By the way, in the book, Pussy Galore was clearly a lesbian and Bond was so hyper-manly that he somehow got her to change her sexual orientation. This aspect was ""cleaned up"" since audiences in 1964 were not ready to see a lesbian major character. In the film, it's only hinted at and Ms. Galore seemed like she was more ""hard to get"" than anything else. Wow,...what a name for a character!",Goldfinger
1,TheLittleSongbird,A serious contender for the best ever Bond,10,18 August 2010,"I am a fan of the James Bond series, and Goldfinger is just amazing for so many reasons. As much as I love Dr.No and From Russia with Love, I think Goldfinger is a serious contender for the best Bond film ever.For me Goldfinger is the slickest of the Bond films in terms of how the stunts are performed and how the story is told. The story mayn't be the most exciting of all the Bonds, but it is still very gripping. The direction is sly, the cinematography is stylish, the locations are stunning and I can never get enough of the theme song sung by Shirley Bassey.The script is sophisticated and humorous, while James Bond is still his suave and charismatic self, Pussy Galore is fabulously sexy and Auric Goldfinger himself ties with Blofeld as the best Bond villain, and a deliciously bizarre one he is too, being obsessed with gold and everything.Other than the theme song and Goldfinger, the action is what makes this film. I love the gadget designs which are wonderfully over-the-top, while my favourite scenes include Shirley Eaton's legendary gold-plated death, the duel with the bowler-hatted sidekick Oddjob and the midair showdown between Bond and Goldfinger.The acting is superb. Sean Connery gives his best performance as the character of Bond, although Connery is the master of suavity and charisma he is even more suave and charismatic here. Honor Blackman is sexy and enthusiastic as Pussy Galore, while Gert Frobe is amazing as Goldfinger. Overall, a golden treasure and a serious contender for the best ever Bond. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Goldfinger
2,bkoganbing,"That's Goldfinger, Not Goldwater",8,9 May 2009,"I wouldn't put too much money on it, but in a small friendly wager, I'd be willing to bet that those who are Bond fans like Goldfinger best of all Bond films. Especially those who think Sean Connery is the best and only man whoever should have played 007.Certainly the most dangerous opponent Bond ever faced was Odd Job, who was Auric Goldfinger's bodyguard and all around assassin. I believe he was the most dangerous opponent James Bond ever fought with in all of his films. Watch that fight scene that Harold Sakata had with Sean Connery, he's got Connery almost down for the count. Fighting skills can only carry you so far when your opponent outweighs you and is built like a brick outhouse. In fact it's only sheer trickery in which Connery overcomes Sakata in a shocking conclusion.As for Gert Frobe who was Goldfinger he's the ultimate Bond villain with the ultimate plan. He's even got his men fooled who think they're going to rob Fort Knox so he can corner the world's gold supply. Actually Goldfinger plans to blow up Fort Knox with an atomic bomb and then he'll really corner the market. Of course it's up to 007 to stop him.The Bond girls are more luscious than ever with two of them, Shirley Eaton and Tania Millet meeting their demise. Eaton was the famous golden girl who Goldfinger suffocated by painting her entire body with gold paint. And of course there's Honor Blackman who switched sides do to the charms of James Bond. Who can ever forget a character name like Pussy Galore.I well remember when Goldfinger was released in 1964 just in time for the presidential campaign. The Republican candidate was Barry Goldwater that year for you young people, not alive at the time. Poor Barry was busy defending himself from charges that he would scrap Social Security, sell the Tennessee Valley Authority and lob one into the men's room at the Kremlin. So all he needed was a film to come out with a master villain with a name so similar. The Democrats had a field day spoofing the title song that Shirley Bassey made such a hit from.Without the Goldwater reference, Goldfinger is still a great action film, one of the best of Bond.",Goldfinger
3,Leofwine_draca,Connery's finest moment as Bond?,10,23 July 2016,"An excellent Bond adventure, with fast cars, beautiful women, great scenes of action, memorable bad guys, and an easygoing performance from Sean Connery, now completely settled into the role and filling it with his own brand of laconic charm. From Shirley Bassey's memorable opening theme tune to the destructive finale, this film is a real treat to watch. My only complaint is that John Barry's famous music seems to be pretty much underused here in comparison to earlier Bond adventures.The movie is pure light entertainment, a slick and fast-paced adventure which crams in lots of action into the one hour and fifty minute running time. Once again there's a fair share of exotic locales, mainly being the mountains of Switzerland and America in this case. The main car of choice here is Bond's famous Aston Martin, making its first appearance and getting totally wrecked in loving glory during the film's course.Glamour is lent by Honor Blackman (okay, so I've never liked Blackman, but this is probably her most famous film role as Pussy Galore) and Tania Mallet as a short-lived would-be assassin. And then there's Shirley Eaton, whose brief but pivotal role gives us that famous image of the gold-painted girl laying dead on a bed. Gert Frobe's villain is larger than life and frequently amusing, while Harold Sakata steals the show as Oddjob, the deadly hat-throwing bodyguard.The various scenes of action are slick and exciting, especially the explosive, spectacular last fifteen minutes which sees a brilliant fight scene between Bond and Oddjob, one of the best ever. The sight of Frobe being sucked out of a plane window is also something to remember. This is a colourful, perfectly-made and expensive-looking movie with a fair smattering of humour to make it easier to watch, and one of Connery's finest moments. Great fun.",Goldfinger
4,SnoopyStyle,The formula is set,8,11 December 2013,"Third in the Bond franchise, this is where the jetsetting style of the James Bond fantasy is established. The spy story is no longer as serious as it is a fashionable action, and outrageous story. It's more about the guns, the gals, and the gadgets.Goldfinger is the gold obsessed villain in this, but it's his henchman Oddjob that leaves the permanent mark (if you get hit by his hat). Who could forget the gold painted Jill Masterson? This movie is more outlandish, and more theatrical. And there is no greater Bond girl name than Pussy Galore. This is the one that sets the formula for the rest of the franchise. It starts from the amazing title song. Other than the first one, this is possibly the most important of all Bond movies. We are off and running.",Goldfinger
5,Hitchcoc,It's Still My Favorite Bond Movie!,10,6 June 2015,"My friend and I were looking for summer jobs in 1964, still in high school. It was 105 degrees outside. We decided instead to go to the Orpheum Theatre in downtown Minneapolis and see Goldfinger. We sat through it five times (they didn't throw you out in those days as long as you had a ticket). I think that my reason for being so enthralled with this is that every teenage boy would have an affinity for the suave and utterly controlled Sean Connery, with his sexuality, his charm, and his wit. Then there is Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore (what a subtle name). There are so many wonderful lines in this film. It has great villains, most memorably the inimitable Odd Job, with his lethal derby hat. Gert Frobe as the arch villain Goldfinger. It has a series of cliffhangers that leave him vulnerable to the bad guys, and he is able to squelch their efforts at every turn. If you've never seen this, get your order in to Netflix!",Goldfinger
6,Horst_In_Translation,This one certainly takes the gold medal,8,12 March 2021,"""Goldfinger"" is a British movie from 1964, so this one is almost 60 years old now or even over 60 years depending on when you read this review of mine. This is of course a James Bond movie we have here and in fact it is the third film from the entire series and considered among the most defining, which is probably never gonna change, no matter how many they will still come up with in the future. This is of course based on Ian Fleming's work, even if he is not credited here on imdb as a writer. Fleming himself died in August 1964, so this came out approximately a month later and he never experienced the longevity this series would have. Nobody really could have expected it back then. Maybe they thought that once Connery would be out, then the series would also not be discontinued. Well, Connery is out now in real life sadly as he died not too long ago, but his 007 heritage lives on for sure. May he rest in peace. This film was on television last night again and I thought I'd give it another watch, even if I have seen it numerous times already, but there is always something new to discover I assume. At pretty much exactly 110 minutes, it is not one of the longest or shortest Bond films, but shorter than most of the new ones for sure, even if Craig also had one that stayed comfortably under the two-hour mark and was also shorter than this one we have here if I remember correctly. The director here is Guy Hamilton and this was the first of four Bond movies he directed. The final effort came from exactly a decade later with Roger Moore in charge, even if he lived on for over 40 years afterwards and died approximately five years ago at a really old age.The writer Richard Maibaum was American and he is really the defining writer when it comes to Bond. Been there since the first film and stayed for the rest of career, which is basically also his life. He was already an Emmy winner by 1964. His co-writer is British and Paul Dehn was even an Oscar winner by then. Not too many will remember him I guess because this is the only 007 movie he worked on, not the only spy movie though. This is of course not only the third Bond movie, but also the third Bond movie starring Connery and he had turned into a star by then already. No coincidence that this film took home two Laurel Awards and one was for Connery himself. How did they not give one to Fröbe though? I will get to him later. Many awards for this happened in the 21st century from the retro perspective, but also back then in the 1960s, this film was a huge success. It took home the Golden Screen here in Germany, which means that really many people watched it (which was certainly also partially thanks to Fröbe), it was nominated for a Grammy and a BAFTA and an Edgar Allen Poe Award that was probably bigger back then than it is today. And of course, it won an Oscar, which is really not a given, especially back then, but also at least partially today if we are looking away from the song category. Strong achievement, even if for some reason there were only two nominees in the sound category that year. As for Connery, there is not that much to say: His approach is the usual with the ruthlessness as well as the tongue-in-cheek on some occasions (especially with the ladies, take his statement when he sees the key bond girl for the first time and hears her name, am I allowed to say that name without my review getting declined?). He is a really good actor and his thick Scottish accent makes it worth even more to watch these in the original, even if of course last night the German dub was on.I think that frequently it's the villains that make these movies and the ones we have here are top-notch. I think it is pretty self-explanatory in terms of Fröbe's Goldfinger that his character is still considered more memorable and more epic compared to the eternal Blofeld, even if the latter was in so many films and Goldfinger only had this one. You could say that his name, also Auric added to the very obvious last name reference, was a bit exaggerated, but this film is so much fun and memorable that they are getting away with everything. I did not really remember how much of a narcissist Goldfinger was. There really is a touch of Midas to him, very fitting reference in the awesome Shirley Bassey song, which is also nice to listen to when we are ""only"" getting the instrumental version here and there. But he does not get saved in the end. His talking to Bond almost had a touch of Columbo at times, how he opens up so much about his plan. He surely respects Bond and even if he despises him, he wants to be admired by him for who he is. Take the moment when he tells Bond who the golf course belongs to. Or also when we have Oddjob throw his hat to decapitate the statue, it's basically Goldfinger showing off. And then there is the really memorable laser scene of course with the ""No, Mr. Bond. I expect you to die"". Hardly anybody was ever this close to killing Bond. Which is a bit funny because the way in which Goldfinger enters the movie feels fairly normal, as if he is a tourist just having a fun time in the sun while playing cards. Also he's the first man with a golden gun.Then, there is Oddjob. Just mentioned him already. In contrast to Fröbe, Sakata was not an established actor before that, but a professional athlete, a wrestler and weightlifter and even Olympic medalist. Impressive. But he kept acting afterwards, so clearly enjoyed it. This one here is by far his most known role though. He turned into a definite contender for greatest henchman from a Bond movie. Maybe Jaws is still ahead of him, but Kiel also had two movies. But they are not too different. Both very silent and lethal and the only time Oddjob (Korean apparently, while the actor was American with Japanese roots) made a sound with his mouth was the moment he died. Also you definitely do not want to be hit by him. We see with 007 on several occasions how painful that feels. You also don't want to be driven to the airport by him, definitely not step into a car with him on the wheel. And you certainly don't want to feel his hat on any occasion. Just like a vengeful young woman had to experience. Also kinda ironic how it was reaching out for his hat that eventually got him killed. A truly great antagonist. Speaking of hats, you also see Bond with a hat in here more often than usual, in the first half mostly. One thing that is not unusual here are the women. Basically every female is a potential love interest for Bond. The exception would be the trigger-happy elderly lady from Blofeld's team. Now she was hilarious. We have three women here other than her and two of them belong to Blofeld too and it's not a surprise that Bond manages to lure them away from him. He often does. I was slightly more surprised that the first victim's sister died so quickly. In other movies, she could have been the main Bond girl.But for that we have Honor Blackman's P. Galore here. She is also really smart, able to pilot all kinds of planes apparently and she knows 007 is one who needs to be kept an eye on as she tells the other woman to stay aware of what he is doing when he enters the bathroom inside the plane. I must still say I have never been big on her honestly. I know many consider her among the finest Bond girls ever, but I feel she is just alright. Maybe because I am not really attracted to her. The scene in the hay was kinda funny though, almost romantic slapstick comedy, also with how she acts like a young girl there. Oh my, I still thought that many people would not be happy today with how he forces himself upon her. Let's hope this will never be censored. Also applies to the scene very early on in which Bond grabs another woman's butt. Female justice warriors in tears. Another woman in here is of course Maxwell's Moneypenny, but her scene(s) as well as the way they included Llewelyn's Q this time did not make much of an impact. Kinda telling how the latter is credited really far behind. They both only had one scene. Car lovers may find Q's kinda interesting though thanks to the Aston Martin inclusion. Back to the story: The Fort Knox idea shows us how much of a megalomaniac Goldfinger really is. Also his arrogance and the way Fröbe portrays it (how he knows for how long exactly the gold will be contaminated) are pretty fun to watch. Okay, how they really all pretend to fall unconscious was maybe a bit much and the way Goldfinger dies was also not too good. Not bad either, but the way Oddjob dies for example was better. For a bit of a change, the main villain really went out last here. They changed that on many occasions. Look at Lee's and Villechaize's surrender for example.Oh and of course I must mention the way in which the first love interest dies: One of the most iconic ways somebody has ever died in a Bond movie for sure and even if not too many remember the actress, the way her character went out clearly stays in the mind. There was also talk about how the actress was in actual danger during the shooting of this scene. And also this made clear how Goldfinger is really not one to joke around with and not just the boastful unlikable neighbor type that he seemed to be early on. A lot more to him as we and Bond painfully find out as the film progresses. Back to the basics: We also get an introduction scene, as it happens nowadays too with 007 films, but this one was really completely unrelated to everything afterwards. Maybe that's why I did not remember it. Card games also got included many times in Bond films after this one, but here it's just a minor introduction, but still props to Bond that he does not even have to play himself to make the bad guy lose. Golf lovers will have a fun time too with this one here, another cheeky moment for 007 how he wins the contest in the end. Oh and no harsh feelings on Goldfinger there. I would want that gold bar too! That's all. If you're new to Bond, great choice to start with. Big thumbs-up.",Goldfinger
7,mark.waltz,"The finger may be cold, but this movie is hot, hot, hot!",8,30 October 2017,"This grabs you right away even before Dame Shirley Bassey starts singing the title song over the credits, probably the most beloved Bond theme ever. ""Shocking!"", Sean Connery says after dispatching one villain in the most sizzling death scenes, and that's within the first few minutes. He'll have his hands full as he takes on the most notorious of all Bond villains, a vile man obsessed with Gold and able to turn a woman into gold, literally suffocating her to death. Connery finds himself at the mercy of that character, played with delicious malevolence by Gert Frobe. At one point, the use of gold gets a little to hot as it nears a very precarious place on Connery's body.Then there's the character of Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman) who works as Frobe's pilot and could literally be out to un- Bond 007. Another villain is a silent Asian strongman, who like the much later Jaws (Richard Kiel) opposite Roger Moore seemed unbeatable. The battle of the will and strength between the two is often both chilling and funny. Even as bizarre and far fetched as these can be, that often makes them even better. And we all know nobody does it better!",Goldfinger
8,classicsoncall,"""No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.""",7,27 April 2018,"I don't doubt that for nostalgia fans, Sean Connery could be the best James Bond ever, or that ""Goldfinger"" might qualify as the best in the Bond series. But nostalgia only goes so far, and my viewing of the film last night turned out to be a bit of a letdown. Agent Bond himself comes across as somewhat incompetent at times, what with getting captured by the bad guys more than once, and his one on one with villain Oddjob appeared awkwardly clumsy. I hate to say it, but almost the entire picture seems somewhat cheesy today, though I have to say, the gold painted first victim was a pretty creative touch.It was right during this era of the mid-Sixties that I became a huge fan of professional wrestling, so the appearance of Harold Sakata was a big bonus for the film as far as I was concerned. I knew him then as Tosh Togo, taking his villain persona from the ring into this picture. One thing the filmmakers could have capitalized on that was missing here was having Oddjob throw salt into Bond's eyes during their little set-to. That was one of Tosh Togo's trademarks. And even now I blush a little when I think of the Bond femme fatale in this flick - who can ever forget the name - Pussy Galore? I thought that was absolutely scandalous at the time, but then again, I was thirteen years old in 1964. Today, yeah, it still sounds kind of scandalous, but who's complaining? The kicker for me though, was when the movie's title character, Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) has the body of Solo (Martin Benson) eliminated by the car crusher. You get to have a pretty clear view of the inside of the car while it's suspended in mid-air, and Solo's body is nowhere to be found. Like I say, cheesy, but not without it's half century old, James Bond charm. Just call me shaken, but not stirred.",Goldfinger
9,gavin6942,A Very Iconic Bond,7,26 June 2014,"Investigating a gold magnate's smuggling, James Bond (Sean Connery) uncovers a plot to contaminate the Fort Knox gold reserve.This film features two iconic villains (Goldfinger and Oddjob) and an iconic theme song, familiar even to those who have never seen a Bond film or have even played the video game series that introduced Bond to a new generation.There really, truly is only one Bond: Sean Connery. Though he has been recast numerous times over the years, and many of those films are probably as good as the Connery ones, this is the man who defined the role. Everyone else, even if they provide their own spin, is really just doing their own interpretation of Connery.",Goldfinger
10,lee_eisenberg,Pussy Galore,8,18 July 2005,"My mom always tells me a story about this one time when she saw ""Goldfinger"". She was seeing it in the theaters a second time. Also in the audience was a prudish girl from my mom's school. My mom looked over at her right as the name ""Pussy Galore"" was spoken, and got a kick out of the girl's horrified expression.Anyway, everyone knows the story: James Bond (Sean Connery) has to stop kingpin Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) from taking over Ft. Knox. Along the way, Bond meets Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman), Oddjob (Harold Sakata) and the gold-painted Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton). Among other things, this was the first James Bond movie with a theme song. Also, this was the first time they incorporated a number of gadgets; after this, the movies had more gadgets than plot. But this one's still good.",Goldfinger
11,jboothmillard,Goldfinger,10,25 February 2005,"The third and best James Bond 007 film of them all. Sir Sean Connery plays Bond for the third time, and this time he is up against a gold smuggler called Auric Goldfinger (Gert Fröbe). There are four most famous things about this film. The first is the great line ""Do you expect me to talk?"" ""No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!"" The second is the villain henchman Oddjob (Harold Sakata (Tosh Togo)) with the murderous bowler hat. The third is the most famous bond girl name, Pussy Galore (played by Honor Blackman). The fourth thing is the use of the most famous film car the Aston Martin DB5, with gadgets such as smoke screen, oil slick, machine guns and the ejector seat. Also starring Shirley Eaton as Jill Masterson, Tania Mallet as Tilly Masterson, Bernard Lee as M, Martin Benson as Martin Solo and Cec Linder as Felix Leiter. It won the Oscar for Best Sound Effects.

It had the most memorable characters and scenes I can remember over these four decades of Bond films. Yes, it's dated by now and not as exciting as when it came out, but it's a treasure among the films of the 1960s.It has a winning combination of good action, drama, romance and comedy. Best of all, it has great characters that all of us who first saw it years ago still remember: ""Auric Goldfinger,"" Oddjob,."" and - of course - ""Pussy Galore,"" one of the all-time great names in the history of film!The story moves fast without overdoing the action. Sure some of it - especially today - looks contrived and corny, but that's part of the fun and charm of the film. Meanwhile, Bond's Aston-Martin DB5 sports car will never go out of style.

13,rmax304823,Some of what glitters is gold.,6,7 February 2009,"Sean Connery, as James Bond, with the help of Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman) prevents Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) from irradiating all the gold stored at Fort Knox, Kentucky, and thereby rendering the basis of America's credit untouchable, along with that of much of the rest of the world. An international monetary crisis. James -- Baby -- where are you when we need you? By the time of this release, 1964, the properties of the James Bond film had been almost formalized. There must be Sean Connery, he of the wicked double entendres, at the center of the whole affair, contesting some monstrous plot to rule the world, or to ruin it, or to do something damaging to it. There must be a beautiful babe at his side, or at least somewhere nearby. In this case, it's Pussy Galore or, as Connery pronounces it, ""Poosy."" (Ian Fleming was noted for his attention to sartorial detail, not for the sophistication or reach of his word play.) There must be gadgets galore, too. The most elaborate on display in this movie is Bond's Aston-Martin with its bullet-proof doors, built-in machine guns, smoke screen, ejector seat, and so forth, all of which, sadly, turn out to be impotent when confronted with a simple low-tech mirror. Some of the gadgets we now take for granted -- one of those car-compactors that squeeze a full-blown auto into a block of metal the size of a ham sandwich. A kind of geopositioning device, a laser gun that was new to the audience at the time. (It has a narrow pink beam! Watch it melt metal!) This differed from the original holotype, ""Dr. No"", in that, by this time, the series had proved sufficiently successful that the budget had been boosted. And the familiar and ominous guitar theme was more or less replaced by a pop song that, it was hoped, would bring in yet more dough. Shirley Bassey sings the uninteresting ""Goldfinger."" The songs were actually to improve in quality over the years -- ""For Your Eyes Only,"" and ""Live and Let Die,"" for instance.There doesn't seem to be much point in describing the plot. If you enjoyed the other entries in the series, you'll enjoy this one. It's pretty much the same as in TV shows. Did you like last week's ""Columbo"" or ""The X Files""? Then you'll like this week's too.Until tonight, I hadn't watched it for about thirty years, and I kind of enjoyed it. By the time another thirty years rolls by, I may enjoy it again.",Goldfinger
14,Tweekums,One of the best Bond films,10,25 August 2011,"In the third, and in many people's opinion, best Bond film James takes a break from battling SPECTRE to investigate businessman Auric Goldfinger. Bond gets Goldfinger's attention by seducing the woman who had been helping him cheat at cards; this leads to one of the most famous scenes in the series where the poor girl is killed by being painted all over with gold. Initially it is thought that Goldfinger's crimes are limited to smuggling gold out of Britain to somewhere he can sell it at a higher price but Bond's investigations lead him to Switzerland where he is captured and taken to Kentucky; here he learns that Goldfinger's plans are far more ambitious; he plans to raid the vaults at Fort Knox! It is one thing for Bond to know his plans but he is still Goldfinger's prisoner so getting the information out will require his seductive abilities.While I'm not sure that this is the best of the series it is certainly up there. 'Goldfinger' introduces the fantastic gadgets that will become a trademark of the series; in this case the iconic Aston Martin that has been given extra features such as machine guns and a passenger ejector seat! Goldfinger isn't the best villain of the series but he does have one of the most memorable lines 'No Mr Bond, I expect you to die!' As expected Sean Connery is great as Bond and Gert Frobe makes a good villain even if he is somewhat upstaged by Harold Sakata who plays his mute henchman Oddjob who has an unusual method of dispatching his enemies. While previous openings weren't bad it was Shirley Bassey's opening song that set the benchmark for all future Bond openings to aspire to; a few have come close but to my mind it has yet to be bettered. The story itself is fairly simple but none the worse for that and there is a nice twist near the end when we learn just what Goldfinger intends to do when he gets into Fort Knox.",Goldfinger
15,ma-cortes,Awesome and breathtaking entry in which James Bond takes on a master criminal called Auric Goldfinger,8,17 February 2021,"007 is back and this time Bond attempts to prevent international gold smuggling by confronting the heinous smuggler Auric Goldfinger and his beautiful pilot Pussy Galore : Honor Blackman robbing Fort Knox . As the extremely nasty Goldfinger: Gert Frobe is planning to sabotage global gold markets by destroying an impressive fortress .This is the third in the series after 'Doctor No' and 'From Russia with Love' , this 'Goldfinger' is perhaps the most popular and being subsequently filmed 'Thunderball'. There are spectacularly impossible stunts in familiar territory and lots of action, while Shirley Bassey sings the catching theme song . Sean Connery , as usual , is top-notch as well as sympathetic , fitting perfectly his character , in fact he's deemed to be the best James Bond . At the same time, he endows 007 with a sense of humor that novelist Ian Fleminng never gave him. Sean Connery who looks great in his Aston Martin , is slyly self-aware that his role is more myth than man. Accompanied by the gorgeous Honor Blackman who burts into international movie recognition and one of the best baddies, Get Frobe in the title role , who does a suitably over-the-top job as the powerful nasty who plans to plunder the American gold reserves in Fort Knox . Another really ominous role for Harold Sakata who steals the show as villainous Korean assistant Oddjob fraught with threat and his deadly bowler hat . Along with regular secondaries as Bernard Lee as M , Louis Maxwell as Monneypenny and Desmond Llewelyn as Q who provides fantastic weapons and the Bond-mobile , in this case a modified Aston Martin which has got fire machine guns , an oíl slick and a radar screen to hunt enemies . Furthermore , brief though fine interpretations from Shirley Eaton, Martin Benson , Tania Maller , Regin, Cec Linder , Bill Nagy , Burt Kwouk , among others.Besides , splendid screenwriters Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn deliver an entertaining script and they miss out on none of the emotion , thriller and suspense of Ian Fleming's novel . Of course , here stands out the long-standing sound from John Barry's musical score .As well as colorful and brilliant cinematography by Ted Moore shot in several spectacular locations .

16,BA_Harrison,14-Karat Bond.,6,3 June 2012,"Goldfinger is considered by many to be the quintessential Bond movie, featuring for the first time virtually all of the elements that have since become synonymous with the franchise: the gadgets, the fancy car, the girls, the megalomaniacal villain, the powerful henchman, the classy (Bassey) theme song, etcetera, etcetera. Personally, though, I see this film as a big step backwards for the franchise.After the excellent From Russia With Love, which boasted a great plot, exotic locations, extremely beautiful women, and continuous excitement, Goldfinger cannot help but seem kinda dull by comparison. There's very little in the way of decent action, a lot of the film looks like it was shot on the Pinewood back-lot, there are several quite simply preposterous plot developments, and Honor Blackman, who might have a big rack, isn't anywhere near sexy enough to be a leading Bond lady.A few iconic moments still qualify this as unmissable for fans of the great spy (most notably, Shirley Eaton painted gold and the laser beam scene), but I find the film's reputation as one of the best hard to understand.",Goldfinger
17,moonspinner55,Enjoyable Bond outing; perfect non-think entertainment...it does all the work for you,7,23 July 2010,"On assignment from ""M"" in Miami Beach, Agent 007 tangles with the nefarious Auric Goldfinger, international transporter of gold bars who's in league with the Red Chinese as well as the American mafia. Third James Bond entry with a much lighter touch (and a dryer sense of humor) than the previous two installments (""Dr. No"" from 1962 and ""From Russia With Love"" in 1963). If the character of Bond no longer resembles the creation of writer Ian Fleming, that's acceptable for most audiences, as Sean Connery's debonair impersonation of the master spy is far more ticklish and devilish than Fleming ever imagined. Connery rides right over the silly complexities of the plot, always willing to seduce, always able to avenge a death with panache. Honor Blackman's Pussy Galore, in-cahoots with Goldfinger to render Fort Knox impenetrable, falls rather quickly for Bond's charms--he doesn't even have to try hard. *** from ****",Goldfinger
18,dbdumonteil,From Ian Fleming novels to the screen..,8,10 February 2005,"This is,along with ""Thunderball"" my all-time favorite Bond.These two movies were the last to follow just about Ian Fleming's plots.After his death,the writer asked the screenwriters to write new stories while keeping his titles.This may account for the long and steady decline of the stories after ""Thunderball"" .Even a genuine artist like Roald Dahl could not save ""you only live twice"".Not that Fleming's novels were that much good.What he wrote was very flat but it was daring,bold for the time.The movies (the first ones that is)are much more entertaining,but they are also watered-down!People who read ""Goldfinger"" do know that the main Bond Girl character is Tilly Masterton (who is killed in the movie by Odd's hat after a ten-minute appearance) .The writers treated the character as anyone of them would have done with a gay character at the time.In the book ,Tilly who is a lesbian meets Pussy Galore and falls in love with her (not with Bond !).She dies only at the very end of the book,the same way .Pussy Galore is a lesbian too -in movie it's suggested :her clothes,her swagger,her female pilots- but it's kept to the minimum .In the book ,Pussy changes totally after meeting Bond,claiming she came to hate men because in her native state "" a virgin is a girl who runs faster than her uncle"" .What remains amazing is that the censorship did accept the very suggestive name ""Pussy Galore"" (the scenarists wanted to change it for ""Kitty Galore"" but an article in an English magazine which showed ""Prince Charles and Pussy "" made them change their mind.A scene which scared me to death when I saw it in the movie theaters when I was 12 was that of the Golden Girl.The scenarists did a good job here:in the book ,James Bond does not see Jill Masterton's body ,he'stold the horrible story by sister Tilly just before both get captured by Goldfinger.Fleming's obsolete circular saw had been smartly replaced, by a laser beam.All in all,Guy Hamilton's film is better than Fleming's book .His sense of space (and of humor) made ""Goldfinger"" the most appreciated of all James Bond.Quite rightly so.",Goldfinger
19,Quinoa1984,"""My name's Pussy Galore."" ""... I must be dreaming.""",10,25 March 2009,"Some of the material in the film adaptation of Ian Fleming's Goldfinger must have been pretty sophisticated in 1964. Much of that, whether or not it was meant to be originally, is funny in that very fun ""un""intentional way that makes watching a work like this even more-so with an audience. It's got dialog that crackles with the knowledge to not take itself too seriously as a movie, and it also knows not to cheat its fans looking for its titular hero to deliver the goods. The good news is 45 years later Goldfinger is still a classic of the spy movie, if only for its cache as a trend-setter (Aston Martin, ""Shaken not stirred"", characters like Q and Moneypenny and named like Pussy Galore).To say it also hasn't aged entirely well would also be not true. Some of the ways, matter of fact most of the ways, that James Bond kills people, or in ways that other people try to kill him, are fairly preposterous. For God sakes, a man has a killer hat and the main villain meets his demise in such an absurd way that it's impossible not to laugh at the magnitude of it. And yet at the same time that one can see the absurdity, or the cheeky one-liners (i.e. shocks a guy in the bathtub, ""Shocking""), the action may have more lasting power and ability to draw any viewer of any age in than say the recent 007 Quantum of Solace. People can only take so much fast cutting and practically R-rated violence, but with the classic-era Bond it straddles a more particular line: realistic absurdity.Matter of fact that is when the Bond movies work best, and though some of the footage and a little of the pacing keep it from not quite being a great ""film"", it certainly can be argued as a great ""movie"". It's got a terrifically wonderful and preposterous plot - the title character, a German elitist who has super elaborate plans with Fort Knox and even more elaborate dioramas to show off to his investors before killing them - and plenty of the same sort of gadgets; seeing a good actor like Daniel Craig with that stern-face doing ""real"" things in flashy cars is one thing, but seeing a STAR like Sean Connery flashing a grin and getting tough in his Astin Martin decked out with tricks and booby-traps is something totally different. Even the villain has some crazy tricks that stick: where else will we see a plane that just happens to gas everyone on cue as happens at Fort Knox?As mentioned, some of it is quite dated, but that's also in line with the fun; the banter between Bond and Moneypenny gives enough room for a whole doctoral feminist paper, and just the name of the lead femme fatale still puts a wallop in any man's day. And extra kudos to two things: Oddjob (Harold Sakata), one of the strangest and most horrific villains in any movie with his preferred lack of dialog and repetitive facial expressions, and John Barry's score which takes the energy or subtlety of a scene and takes it into unexpected territory. There's excitement, sure, but a scene where Bond is trapped at night by gunpoint and has to momentarily surrender the music goes soft and slow at just the right pitch.Goldfinger was and remains a remarkable achievement in popcorn movie-making, and even those who aren't too keen on newer Bond flicks can take a look and see how sexy and self-conscious and knowing it is of itself and its audience, and how its mostly all for the better. That the film may even be funnier in some parts than in its subsequent Mike Myers Austin Powers parodies is also a tip-of-the-hat to its quality. 9.5/10",Goldfinger

It is said that a Jewish family came forward to thank him. If this is true, he should be considered by Yad Vashem as a righteous person.The film is filled with action and still holds strong after 45 years.Sean Connery's delivery of certain lines is wonderfully sarcastic. Those lines after people get electrocuted would bring a chuckle to anyone.Shirley Bassey's rendition of the title song is marvelously staged. Amazing that this song did not win the Oscar for best song.Hard to believe that Honor Blackman, who portrayed Pussy Galore, will be 82 in December. Are we all getting older?",Goldfinger
21,BandSAboutMovies,Near perfect,8,4 April 2020,"If From Russia With Love was big, Goldfinger is the Bond movie that nearly everyone sees as the greatest success in the series.With the court case between Kevin McClory and Fleming surrounding Thunderball still in the High Court - more on that this week - producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman picked this story as the third film. They enjoyed a budget that was pretty much the same as both Dr. No and From Russia With Love combined.However, Terence Young was out after a pay dispute and Guy Hamilton, who had turned down Dr. No, came on board. His idea changed the series - no longer was Bond nearly superhuman; instead his villains would be stronger than him. Hamilton would make three more Bond pictures: Diamonds Are Forever, Live and Let Die and The Man with the Golden Gun.It also saw the return of stunt coordinator Bob Simmons and production designer Ken Adam, whose presence can be felt in every frame. Before Goldfinger, Bond had a few gadgets. After, gadgets would be one of the reasons to show up for his movies.After destroying a drug dealer's operation in Latin America, Bond (Sean Connery, coming back for his third film) goes to Miami Beach on what should be a vacation. Instead, CIA agent Felix Leiter (Cec Linder, taking over the role from Jack Lord) asks him to observer Auric Goldfinger (German actor Gert Fröbe, whose dialogue was dubbed by Michael Collins; he also dubbed him in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, another movie made from an Ian Fleming book), a rich man obsessed with gold.Orson Welles was going to play the role, but he asked for too large of a salary. Oh, what could have been.Goldfinger is cheating at a game of gin rummy - a simple illustration that he corrupts even the most idle of pursuits - with the help of his employee Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton, who is also in The Million Eyes of Sumuru and The Girl From Rio; she was already a sex symbol but the imagery of her from this film took her to another level). Bond, of course, seduces her and wins the game. Goldfinger wins the whole war by having his henchman Oddjob (former pro wrestler Harold Sakata) knock out 007 and then paints Jill gold, killing her from skin suffocation.Seriously - we're a few minutes in to this movie and it already blows away everything that came before.Here's a strange story: Fleming had based the villain on Modernist architect Erno Goldfinger, who threatened to sue when he found out he was to be a spy villain. Fleming's publisher begged him to change the character's name, to which Bond's creator offered to change it to Goldprock. The case was settled out of court.This sets off several stories - Bond trying to determine how Goldfinger is stealing gold and getting richer; Oddjob determined to kill Bond with his steel-rimmed hat; Tilly Masterson's vendetta against Goldfinger to get revenge for her sister's death, only to be killed by Oddjob; Goldfinger attempting to rob Fort Knox and his henchwoman Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman, who was Mrs. Gale on The Avengers before this).Galore was based on Fleming's friend, mistress and muse Blanche Blackwell. As his wife disapproved of the Bond novels, Fleming grew closer to Blackwell. She inspired not just Galore, but also Dr. No's Honeychile Rider. Her son Chris Blackwell would go on to form Island Records.In the book, Galore runs an all-lesbian Harlem gang known as the Cememnt Mixers. Well, in the movie, she's the leader of a Flying Circus of acrobatic, judo fighting and plane flying women. Yes, only in the world of Bond.You also have to adore that the movie ends with a battle where Goldfinger is pulled out the window of a jet. As the plane crashes, Bond and Galore hide under a parachute. Despire her being a criminal, Bond seems like the one who doesn't want to be found - a theme that will continue as the series goes forward.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that Shirley Bassey's ""Goldfinger"" song is astounding. To hit the note at the end of the song, she had to take her bustier off in the studio. And you know who is playing guitar on it? Jimmy Page.The Aston Martin. The laser scene. ""No, Mr. Bond. I expect you to die."" Oddjob. Suggestively named ladies. The playful fighting between Q and Bond.If you're going to watch one Bond movie, this should be it. Me? I'm watching hundreds of spy movies all month long.",Goldfinger
22,Coventry,Bond Quintessential Bond!,8,10 September 2017,"Every individual James Bond film has some good assets and at least two or three special qualities that make it fantastically entertaining. ""Goldfinger"", however, exclusively has great assets and special qualities! I think this third entry in the series is almost unanimously – and righteously – labeled as THE best Bond movie of all. It's definitely also the most quintessential title to watch in order to get fully acquainted with the lead character's personality and working methods, as well as with the type of assignments he receives from his employer, his opponents and the hi- tech attributes he gets to help him. You'd expect all this to become clear already in the first film, ""Dr. No"", but the character created by Ian Fleming was still fairly unknown back then and hence the production values were a lot lower. Barely two years and only one sequel later, James Bond had already become a phenomenon and ""Goldfinger"" delivered the incredibly high expectations of the fans. It truly also is a terrific film, with an utmost solid script, a top three legendary villain and various highly memorable action & suspense sequences. Personally, I have the bizarre habit of ranking my favorite Bond movies based on the evil- factor and charisma of the villains, and thus ""Goldfinger"" is quite high up there thanks to the sublime roles of Gert Fröbe as the titular character and Harold Sakata as Oddjob, his silent but deadly henchman who pulverizes golf balls with his bare hands and throws around his killer-hat of steel. The gold-obsessed magnate has thought up an ingenious plan to rob the entire American gold supply from Fort Knox and naturally it's 007's job to prevent this from happening. Therefore Bond infiltrates into Goldfinger's private affairs twice; messing up his game cheating routines and seducing his female accomplices. Auric Goldfinger is undoubtedly one of the most vicious Bond-villains, but arguably also one of the dumbest! Never before or after did 007's opponents receive so many open and easy chances to eliminate him, but Goldfinger decides not to take the risk and kill his disloyal female assistants instead! Many, many sequences in this third Bond film are pure vintage, including the white tuxedo underneath the diving suit, Shirley Eaton's golden corpse, an uncomfortable laser beam moment and – of course – every scene with that awesome Aston Martin!",Goldfinger
23,studioAT,Bond 3,8,10 March 2020,"'Dr No' and 'From Russia With Love' did excellent jobs of establishing the Bond franchise but it's 'Goldfinger' that would send it up a notch, becoming perhaps the template for all the outings to follow.With Sean Connery now very assured in the role of 007, and lots of quips and action sequences (many of which are still being spoofed today) this is a Bond film that ups the ante quite excellently.",Goldfinger

25,hitchcockthelegend,"Bond, Bowler Hats, Galore and the Man With the Midas Touch.",9,21 April 2012,"Goldfinger is directed by Guy Hamilton and adapted to screenplay by Richard Maibaum & Paul Dehn from the novel written by Ian Fleming. It stars Sean Connery, Gert Frobe, Honor Blackman, Shirley Eaton & Harold Sakata. Music is by John Barry and cinematography by Ted Moore.Operation Grand Slam.Connery's third outing as James Bond sees 007 investigating the movements of wealthy gold dealer Auric Goldfinger (Frobe). Little does 007 or MI6 know, but Goldfinger is hatching a master plan that will spell disaster for the world's financial climate.Undeniably the turning point in the James Bond franchise, Goldfinger is also one of the most fondly remembered by the cinema loving public. Here is when Bond not only went go-go gadget crazy, but he also impacted on pop culture to the point the waves created are still being felt today. Bond traditionalists are often irked by the mention of the change Goldfinger represents, and with just cause, because this really isn't Fleming's core essence Bond. Bond has now become a gadget using super agent, a man who laughs in the face of death, a quip never far from his lips. Yet the hard facts are that this Bond is the one the world really bought into, ensuring for the foreseeable future at least, that this type of Bond was here to say. Marketing was high pitched, fan worship became feverish and the box office sang to the tune of $125 million. Toys, gimmicks and collectables would follow, the Aston Martin DB5 would become ""The Most Famous Car in the World"", in 1964 Bond truly became a phenomenon.Purely on an entertainment front, Goldfinger delivers royally, the sets, casting and the high energy set-pieces all seep with quality. This in spite of the actual plot being one of the weakest in the whole franchise. As great a villain as Auric Goldfinger is, with a voice dubbed Frobe simply joyous in the role, his motives are rather dull and hardly cause for some worldwide Bondian panic. But the film rises above it to the point it only really registers long after the end credits have rolled. We have been treated to Odd Job (Sakata instantly becoming a Bond villain legend), that laser, the DB5 and its tricks, the delicious Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore (still an awesome name today and still sounding like a character from a Carry On movie), the golf match, Shirley Eaton's golden girl and the ticking time bomb finale played out during the chaotic scenes involving Ken Adam's brilliantly designed version of Fort Knox.Bond staples also serve the production well, the title sequence is neatly strung together as scenes from the movie play out over a writhing golden girl, who was model Margaret Nolan and who briefly appears in the film as Dink. The theme tune is a blockbuster, sang with gusto by Shirley Bassey and the locations dazzle the eyes as we are whisked to Switzerland, Kentucky and Miami. Stock characters continue to make their marks, with M, Moneypenny and Q (setting in motion the wonderful serious v jocular axis of his ""to be continued"" relationship with Bond), starting to feel like old cinematic friends. Only let down is Cec Linder's turn as Bond's CIA counterpart, Felix Leiter, gone is the swagger created by Jack Lord in Dr. No, and while Linder is no bad actor, he doesn't sit right in the role, he's looks too world weary. A shame because he is integral to how the plot pans out.Director Guy Hamilton was helming the first of what would end up being four Bond movies on his CV, he made his mark by bringing more zip and quip to the Bond character. Connery was firmly ensconced in the role of Bond, he was a mega star because of it, but cracks were beginning to appear in how Connery viewed this gargantuan success and the impact it was having on his hopes to be viewed as a serious actor. However, he was signed up for Thunderball, the next James Bond adventure, and Terence Young would return to the director's chair, could they top the success of Goldfinger? 9/10",Goldfinger
26,Theo Robertson,If Only All Bond Movies Were This Good,7,14 July 2003,"I first saw GOLDFINGER round about 1977 and it has been shown on British television more times than I can count . In fact it`s somewhat ridiculous the amount of times it`s been repeated and having seen it so many times after more than 25 years I find it impossible to say much on it.I will say however that future Bond production teams seem to have taken all the lesser bits of GOLDFINGER while completely ignoring all the good elements . The lesser bits are the awful puns like "" Shocking "" and "" He blew a fuse "" . How many times have you watched a Bond movie where the hero has dispatched a bad guy and you`ve made your own pun which is ten times better than the one Bond says to camera ? Exactly . Of course in 1964 these one liners might have been ground breaking but after the franchise has gone on you feel that the screenwriters have been ordered to write a sequence so that Bond can make a groan inducing one liner . Oh and I haven`t even mentioned Pussy Galore ( Insert your own joke here ) , this is another thing that the producers seem obsessed with - woman with completely unreal names , everytime someone makes a Bond movie we get a Plenty O Toole or some such weird name . The novelty wears out very quickly .What I liked about GOLDFINGER is that James Bond is shown as being vulnerable , it`s about the only film in the franchise when he is unable to save the lives of his lovers for example , and lets not forget the classic scene of the lazer beam creeping up the table where he has to use his wits , and has anyone noticed that he doesn`t actually save the day at the Fort Knox climax ? He doesn`t even need to be there . Compare that scenario with the later Bond movies ( Especially the Roger Moore ones ) when he stops the baddies single handed in a ridiculously contrived and OTT manner , such a pity they don`t make Bond films like this anymore .Despite seeing GOLDFINGER more times than I care to mention I`ll no doubt watch it again next time it`s on British television",Goldfinger
27,Doylenf,The third time is the charm...suave Bond has never been better...,7,27 August 2006,"SEAN CONNERY was undoubtedly the best of the Bonds and GOLDFINGER has him as the suave spy facing his most diabolical villain (GERT FROBE), who plays the title character in a story about Frobe's attempt to destroy Fort Knox.From the moment we hear Shirley Bassey's ""Goldfinger"" over the opening credits, we know we're in for something special. This is probably the most elaborate of all the Bonds to date, and its pulsating background score is just another reason to enjoy it to the max. That and the number of gadgets employed to catch our attention. This is one Bond where the gadgets are more important than the blondes.But that's not to say that SHIRLEY EATON (as the gal who gets plastered in gold paint) and HONOR BLACKMAN (as the wicked Pussy Galore) aren't here for eye candy. They fill their roles nicely, but it's the various set pieces and action packed thrills that keep the plot spinning toward the direction of the big Fort Knox climax.Bernard Lee is on hand as ""M"" while Lois Maxwell does her usual sparkling job as Miss Moneypenny, Bond's wistful secretary, and it's all very skillfully directed by Guy Hamilton.",Goldfinger

31,zardoz-13,"""Goldfinger"" Was the First Modern 007 Movie",10,25 January 2009,"The third James Bond movie, director Guy Hamilton's ""Goldfinger,"" established the template of gals, goons, and gadgets that all Bond adventures would rigidly adhere to without fail until Pierce Brosnan departed and producers reinvented the franchise with Daniel Craig in ""Casino Royale."" Indeed, ""Goldfinger"" bore little resemblance to the threadbare ""Dr. No"" or the ambitious but quaint ""From Russia, With Love"" with its Hitchcock inspired helicopter chase. The previous Bonds had been successful with both the critics and audiences, but ""Goldfinger"" qualifies as a truly modern Bond. This audacious actioneer catapulted the 007 franchise beyond anything comparable to it and literally overhauled the genre for the early 1960s. ""Goldfinger"" proved such a colossal hit that other producers either imitated its surefire formula or parodied it. Whereas Terence Young had imbued ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia, With Love"" with his competent, elegant craftsmanship, Guy Hamilton brought a slick gloss to ""Goldfinger"" that Young didn't recapture when he returned to helm ""Thunderball."" Lewis Gilbert followed Hamilton's polished example with ""You Only Live Twice"" as did Peter Hunt with ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service."" Critics and readers alike often consider fidelity to the source novel in adapting a book to the big-screen an indispensable virtue. In the case of Ian Fleming's novel ""Goldfinger,"" scenarists Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn retained most of the material, but discarded Fleming's preposterous Fort Knox heist caper and upgraded it for the nuclear age with a twist.""Goldfinger"" boasts many memorable things, particularly James Bond's new adversary, Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) and his deadly Korean bodyguard Oddjob (Harold Sakata) who wield a lethal bowler hat with a razor-sharp brim. Unlike previous Bonds, SPECTRE (Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion) played no part in ""Goldfinger."" Until ""Live and Let Die,"" Bond constantly tangled with the global criminal syndicate. Meanwhile, everything about ""Goldfinger"" was larger-than-life. Whereas ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia, With Love"" had pushed the envelop with their exotic plots, ""Goldfinger"" shredded the envelope, ignored believably, and cheerfully barreled forward with a grandiose scheme that involved rendering the American gold supply at Fort Knox unusable. The eponymous villain was virtually an independent who relied on the Red Chinese only for the use of an atomic device as a part of his master plan: contaminating American gold in Fort Knox. Greed motivated Goldfinger above all else along with his desire to win. Among Bond villains, he is singular in his complicated characteristics. The loss of American gold would drive up the market value of his gold, while the Red Chinese would benefit from the economic chaos in the west. Goldfinger's bodyguard with his exotic weapon represented a first. Goldfinger's private pilot, Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman), emerges as the first of the Bond girls with a risqué name, so risqué that United Artists worried about her name. The concept of a sacrificial girl who dies at the hands of the villains started with ""Goldfinger."" ""Goldfinger"" differed drastically from all the Bonds in one respect. After Tilly and he are discovered near the villain's factory in Switzerland, Bond is taken hostage and remains this way until the finale at Fort Knox. Interestingly, too, this is the only time when Bond is perfectly helpless. Strapped down to the table in Goldfinger's laboratory with a laser burning a line straight for his crotch, James Bond cannot escape and he has no handy gadgets to help himself out of this cliffhanger predicament. Instead, he relies on his wits rather than his fists and creates enough doubt in his adversary's mind that Goldfinger decides to let him live because he is more useful alive than dead. While Q issued Bond with an attaché case with special qualities in ""From Russia, With Love,"" ""Goldfinger"" went all the way with its gadgetry. This is the first adventure where Bond had the modified Aston-Martin with its machine guns, oil slick, bullet-proof shield, a tracking system, and an ejection seat. John Barry's music was distinctive with the bombastic theme song belted out by Shirley Bassey and his loud, jazzy score that emphasized plot points.Bond movie always imitated themselves and the story structure, including entire scenes, were used in Guy Hamilton's next Bond movie ""Diamonds Are Forever."" For example, Colonel Smither's lecture about gold corresponds to Sir Donald's lecture about diamonds. During both meetings, Bond reveals his knowledge about liquor. In ""Goldfinger,"" he judges brandy, while in ""Diamonds"" he judges sherry. The counterpart to the laser beam scene is the coffin scene in the crematorium. Ironically, despite the paranoia that created the tension of the Cold War between the Allies and the Soviet Union and their allies, the James Bond movie producers refused to exploit this tension. Instead, the villains often exploited the tension themselves in an effort to delude the adversaries into destroying themselves.",Goldfinger

Ah yes, I truly miss some good old fashioned fist fights in movies sometimes, without any fancy camera tricks or editing.Sean Connery really is at his best and also probably at his funniest in this Bond movie. Gert Fröbe plays a classic and unforgettable villain and Harold Sakata his sidekick Oddjob, who is one of those villains that often appear in a Bond movie, who can't seem to feel any pain and are stronger than really possible.

However, since James Bond is a hero doing that at which he's best (smoking, boozing, and getting hot chicks killed), who's to quibble? A roll in the hay with ""Pu$$y Galore"" probably beats one with ""Marnie"" from the horsey set, though only Sean Connery is in a position to know (and his cruise honeymoon marital rape of the latter was not on-screen as much as his escapades in the stable with the former). Most drivers have been dying to own an Aston Martin DB5 with surface-to-surface missiles since GOLDFINGER showed the cure for road hogs and Tail-Gaters. But for many men, that car is not much further out of reach than disengagement by Auric's preferred method: skin suffocation. Paint is pretty pricey nowadays, too.",Goldfinger
34,neil-476,Exoticism kicks in,8,20 December 2010,"Dr No and From Russia With Love were relatively straightforward spying capers. Goldfinger, the third in the Bond film series, marks the point where Bond moves away from espionage/national security-related issues, and takes a step into the realms of the outlandish. The novel on which this moderately faithful adaptation is based also takes early steps in that direction, but the film-makers compound the felony by adding the wrinkle of Goldfinger planning not to steal the contents of Fort Knox, but to irradiate it by setting off a nuclear explosion. Not to mention Oddjob, of course, the first in a series of increasingly outrageous villainous henchmen - Red Grant was believable, Oddjob and his lethal bowler hat were not.It sounds as if I'm being critical, and I'm not. Goldfinger was great escapist fun and contained more than its fair share of iconic moments - the reveal of the gold-painted Shirley Eaton, Bond getting as good as he gives from Pussy Galore (and boy, did Connery give Ian Fleming's rather childish single entendre name a run for its money!), the emasculatory laser and Goldfinger's ""No Mr Bond, I expect you to die!"" line...But there is no doubt that it represented the first step on the road which ultimately led to stealing space capsules and submarines, invisible cars and ice palaces etc.. For some people those things spell Bond - for me they gradually weakened the series until Casino Royale pulled it back into (quasi-)reality.",Goldfinger
35,gridoon2021,The best Bond film,8,22 May 2009,"One of the strangest things about ""Goldfinger"" is that, although it is probably one of the least action-packed films in the entire series (basically there is the opening, the climax, and a car chase in-between), time flies by when you're watching it. That probably happens because the pacing is so knowingly unhurried, allowing the film to tell a story and the dialogue to take center stage over the action (a lesson that a lot of other Bond films would benefit from). IMO, Sean Connery hit his absolute peak as Bond in the next film, ""Thunderball"", but this is his second-best performance; for those who think that he can't play the ""emotional"" Bond, his often neglected scene with M should be enough proof of the opposite. Goldfinger is a superior villain, often ahead of Bond in his plans, and Oddjob still remains the best henchman in the series - they both receive memorably creative exits! Pussy Galore is one of the most voluptuous Bond girls, and watching her in her figure-hugging outfits is perhaps even sexier than a nude scene would have been. She is also one of the first (if not THE first) women to perform martial arts moves of any type in a theatrically released film. The two Masterson girls are underrated, especially Jill, who apart from being the famous ""golden girl"", manages to create a playful, fun character in about 5 minutes of screen time. The gadgets are among the neatest in the series, especially the ""ejector seat"". John Barry's work is so good that a music-score-only version of the movie would be worth seeing (and listening to). ""Goldfinger"" is filled with classic moments, and, along with ""From Russia With Love"", still remains the highest point the Bond series has reached to this date. *** out of 4.",Goldfinger
36,Uriah43,One of the Most Popular James Bond Films,6,9 December 2012,"This third film in the series is probably one of the most popular James Bond films ever made. Sean Connery returns as ""Agent 007"" with orders to keep an eye on ""Auric Goldfinger"" (Gert Frobe) in Miami. While observing him he notices Goldfinger cheating in a game of gin. So he sneaks up into the hotel room where a beautiful woman named ""Jill Masterson"" (Shirley Eaton) is spying on Goldfinger's opponent with binoculars and talking in a secret microphone to transmit his opponent's cards to him. James Bond takes the microphone and tells him to start losing-or else. While Goldfinger angrily complies, James Bond decides to make romance with Jill. Afterward, he decides to get a bottle of wine from the refrigerator and gets knocked out from someone else who has entered the room. When he wakes up he finds Jill's nude body painted gold and quite dead. After that he goes back to England and is told to continue to keep an eye on Goldfinger. Anyway, rather than spoil the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this is a decent film even though it isn't entirely believable. It boasts one of the more memorably named female villains in ""Pussy Galore"" (Honor Blackman). It also has one of the better evil henchmen named, ""Oddjob"" (Harold Sakata) and one of the coolest cars for James Bond to drive. That said, while I thought the movie was fairly entertaining, I don't consider it to be as good as its two predecessors (""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia with Love""). No doubt other people will disagree and that's fine. But when all is said and done I think we can all agree that most people who enjoy James Bond films will certainly be satisfied with this one.",Goldfinger

Director Guy Hamilton details the film with the inventive gadgets that are somewhat comical but ultimately useful during those tight tense moments. Sean Connery returns for this third outing and he is nearly outdone when strapped to a table and nearly penetrated with a laser. Earlier in the film he is a witness to a gold painted female whom was in his sleeping quarters the evening before. Gert Frobe plays one of the best and most sinister of Bond villains. Goldfinger is the symbol of power as his gold obsessed nature becomes near dominant until Bond narrowly defeats him in a climatic battle on a plane. Harold Sakata plays henchman Oddjob who uses his hat for lethal boomerang action. Bond will use this ability against him in an electrifying battle. Finally there is Honor Blackman as the memorable Pussy Galore who trains female pilots known as The Flying Circus. Shirley Eaton has the famous death scene where Bond discovers her completely coated in gold paint. The result is a fun and exciting spy action film that turns out gold that Goldfinger wouldn't likely understand. Score: 9 / 10",Goldfinger

Though I have another that's my favourite.Gert Frobe as Goldfinger, steals the show for me. His exuberance and sense of humour, while entertaining and undergoing his dastardly scheme make him so likeable. I love the pace of the film as well; there's poolside gambling, a friendly game of golf, some scenic driving and time enough to sit captive in a cell while still engaging. Connery's an excellent actor and this is his best film, but I prefer others in the role. There's no one Bond girl here, Shirley Eaton the most remarkable, if only briefly. Oddjob is unique and deadly, but a bit silly though. I had completely forgot about the old lady unloading on Bond, heh. One of those bullets had to hit! The shootouts aren't great. The song by Bassey however, classy and memorable.",Goldfinger

Bond must stop this evil plan of course, but is challenged not only by Goldfinger's henchman, but the group of women skydivers led by Honor Blackman as well, who is a provocatively named female character, who Bond tries to seduce in order to win over to his side.Fantastic title song punctuates this fun(if far-fetched) adventure.",Goldfinger

For some reason though this one is always held in very high esteem. Some say it is where Connery really hit his stride as Bond, but I thought he was just as good in ""From Russia With Love"".  The problem I find with the movie is when Bond goes to Kentucky, it just isn't that exotic of a location for a Bond movie.  I love the first half where he is simply driving after Goldfinger, but then he is captured and the movie kinda gets bogged down as he tries to escape or at least get word to Felix about Goldfinger's plan. All that said though it is still a thouroughly enjoyable pic.  The conclusion more than makes up for my perceived dead spot and there are an assortment of enjoyable characters like Oddjob and Pussy Galore (though that has to be the stupidest name, no parent would name their kid that).",Goldfinger
41,Wuchakk,Iconic 60's Bond film,8,2 October 2013,"Released in 1964 (or January, 1965, in the USA), ""Goldfinger"" was the third Bond film in three years. This was the film that pushed 007 over-the-top and is rightly considered a classic. It's very iconic of mid-60's cinema -- the title song, the gold-painted woman, Oddjob's deadly hat and the breaking into Fort Knox. The next two films in the series are just as great and IMHO better -- ""Thunderball"" (1965) and ""You Only Live Twice"" (1967). ""Thunderball"" made more at the box office than any other Bond flick from the Connery era and ""You Only Live Twice"" upped the ante with the action & spy stuff and is just all-around entertaining.Yet ""Goldfinger"" continues to be the Bond film that's most highly regarded of the 60s and this should be respected. But don't expect the wall-to-wall action that was introduced with ""You Only Live Twice"" and remains to this day. Yes, ""Goldfinger"" has some quality action sequences, but less than what you'd typically get from a 007 flick post-""Thunderball."" In fact, one clash in the film is a simple game of golf between James and Goldfinger (Gert Fröbe). An earlier scene involves Bond forcing Goldfinger to lose a card game. This doesn't make ""Goldfinger"" bad, of course, just different. ""A View to a Kill"" (1985) is notable for the same reason.Other positives include a fairly long sequence in the magnificent Swiss Alps, where it was shot, and quality Bond women like Shirley Eaton (the 'golden girl') and brief appearances by Margaret Nolan (Dink) and Nadja Regin (Bonita); Honor Blackman is cool as Pussy Galore, but she never tripped my trigger.Despite all the good, there are some negatives. For instance, the gas fly-over by Pussy Galore's girls and the falling-over of the troops comes off lame. There's also a little too much ""down time"" in the second half that's not all that interesting.Nevertheless, ""Goldfinger"" is a James Bond classic, full of iconic imagery and scenes. When it was released it was extraordinary, but it may now strike some viewers as tame or even lame in ways. Regardless, it's definitely a worthy Bond flick and has its unique charm.The film runs 1 hour, 50 minutes, and was shot in Miami Beach, Florida; England; Switzerland; and Kentucky.GRADE: A-",Goldfinger

After Dr. No that scored very good on here but that I only scored a five, and From Russia With Love that also scored good on here and that I scored a six, its the turn for Goldfinger. This one is a serious step forward compared to Dr. No. Not only is the story better but it's also better shot and made. It looks like they figured out where they want to go with the spy stories. The gadgets look already a bit more interesting. Even Sean Connery, the best James Bond in my opinion, is doing a better job.

44,Mr-Fusion,Sets the standard,9,27 September 2014,"GOLDFINGER is about as iconic as James Bond gets. Mike Myers knew this when he made AUSTIN POWERS, and more often than not, when you see someone parodying OO7, they're most likely zeroing in on this movie's memorable pop culture bits: Odd Job's death-dealing hatPussy Galore and her foxy five squadronLaser beam interrogationThe Aston Martin DB-5, chock-full of killer gadgetsThe funny thing about GOLDFINGER is that Bond spends a good deal of the movie getting captured. The CIA has to come in and help him out in the end, he depressurizes a plane, and gets his butt handed to him in a fistfight with Odd Job. But these are far from complaints, and the movie still grandiose, exciting and nicely self-aware. There's beautiful Alps scenery, great comic book sets, the smokin' Honor Blackman, and it's got one of the really standout opening themes of the series. On top of that, there's the DB-5, which pretty much set the standard for spy cars for the past half century (and they don't come any sweeter). My dad wisely chose this movie to indoctrinate his kid at ten years old, and this has been one of my favorite Bond movies for 25 years now. And for good reason. Connery owns the screen. This movie is bombastic, irresistibly sexist and great fun. 9/10",Goldfinger
45,SimonJack,Bond gets his first toys,8,25 August 2017,"With two box office hits in the first two Bond films, the English producers knew they had a hit series on their hands with Ian Fleming's 007 special agent. If there was any doubt remaining before the release of this one, it would squelch it. ""Goldfinger"" earned 17 times its budget at the box office. At $51 million, it was the second highest grossing film for 1964 in the U.S. ""My Fair Lady"" was first, at $72 million, but its gross was just over four times its budget. ""Goldfinger"" was the biggest moneymaker of the year. The salaries of the players, especially leads, are starting up with the obvious success of the Bond films. Sean Connery's Bond is challenged by the leading female in this film, Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore. Blackman had a lengthy film career, but never rose much above her role here. German actor Gert Fröbe plays Goldfinger. Because of his thick German accent, his voice was dubbed by English actor Michael Collins. Fröbe had a significant career in films, mostly in Germany. He played comedy as well as dramatic roles. American and English audiences will know him also for his roles in ""Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines"" of 1965 and ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" of 1968. Shirley Eaton, who plays Jill Masterson, had a modest career, mostly in British films, and was in several of the ""Carry On"" series of films. But after 40 films she quit acting in 1969 at age 32 to raise her family. Tania Mallet was earning a nice livelihood ($2,000 per week) as a model, and her role as Till Masterson (paid $150 per week) was the only real character she played on film. She had one other uncredited role in a production to ""The New Avengers"" in 1976. This is also the first time that a Bond film would be made by an American studio – Warner Brothers. And all of this film was shot at the studio locations in California. The plot didn't involve a number of exotic locales, and the diverse California terrain suited the film needs for foreign locales as well as for Fort Knox, Kentucky. This film is the first look we get of the specialty weapons and gadgets section of MI-6 that is headed by ""Q."" And, Bond makes use of considerable technology in the film. Most of it comes with his new car, an Austin Martin DB5. ""Goldfinger"" also scored the first Oscar win for a Bond film for, what else – special effects. The practice continued of releasing the Bond film in the U.K. ahead of the U.S., but the lag time between the two was now just over three months. With the Bond spy and action thriller successes, a new genre of film was taking shape. The mystery, action, thriller aspects would lead to popular TV programs such as ""Mission Impossible"" from 1966 to 1973. Movies by the same titles would follow later, and by the 1980s, these fast action films would begin to dominate the mystery field. ""Indiana Jones"" was a popular series of films beginning in the 1980s. Regular Crime and mystery films took on the action and violence aspects of these earlier films. The ""Dirty Harry"" films with Clint Eastwood were top films of the 1970s and 1980s. The ""Die Hard"" films followed in the 1980s and early 21st century. Many action comic book character films have been popular that thrive on action, thrills and violence.",Goldfinger
46,ShadeGrenade,"""Let's have some fun with Mr.Goldfinger!""",10,12 May 2009,"Ian Fleming's 'Goldfinger' was the first adult book I ever read. My father kept a pile of dogeared paperbacks on his dressing table, and when he was out, I would peruse these in the hope of finding salacious material. Amongst the various works by Mickey Spillane and James Hadley Chase was this, whose cover had a woman whose skin was the colour of gold. That grabbed my attention. I read it from cover to cover, and enjoyed every preposterous word. James Bond is in Miami when he receives an order from M, his superior, to keep an eye on one Auric Goldfinger, thought to be working for SMERSH. 007 finds he is taking a millionaire to the cleaners every day by cheating on cards, so he wrecks the scheme and in so doing, makes an enemy for life.They next meet at Sunningdales golf club, England, and in a superbly written scene Bond outwits him again. Here we meet Goldfinger's henchman, the mute smiling Korean 'Oddjob' whose bowler hat, when thrown, becomes a deadly weapon. Bond follows the pair to Switzerland, where the bullet-headed German runs a gold-smuggling operation. Not content with this, he is working on a grand scheme to crown his criminal career - he intends breaking into Fort Knox...The film debuted on I.T.V. in late 1976, and as I watched I mentally ticked off all the similarities to the novel. Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn's marvellous script managed to be faithful, but made one important change - the film Goldfinger intends to detonate a cobalt bomb in Fort Knox, thereby increasing the value of his gold supply thousands of times over. In the book, Goldfinger wanted to literally rob the place - a technical impossibility, as critics of the time pointed out. Hence it was the first ( only? ) Bond movie to significantly improve on the book. Sadly, Fleming never lived to see it.Sean Connery's terse, arrogant Bond ( of 'Dr.No' ) has been replaced by a more likable, humorous character. The film dares to make fun of 007 at times - witness the opening in which he emerges from the sea with a rubber duck on his head, and later he pulls a face at an unsmiling Korean guard, but his dignity somehow manages to stay intact. The rest of the cast are great too: Gert Frobe's 'Goldfinger' and Honor Blackman's 'Pussy Galore' ( how on Earth did they get away with a name like that then? ) being worthy of the highest possible praise. Harold Sakata's 'Oddjob' proved so popular attempts were made to replicate him over the years with other sinister villains, most notably Richard Kiel's 'Jaws'. Desmond Llewelyn makes his second appearance as 'Q', becoming the tetchy gadget man ( ""I never joke about my work, 007!"" ) so beloved of audiences. Many scenes have passed into 007 folklore - Q's demonstrating the Aston Martin DB5 with revolving number plates and ejector seat, Jill Masterton ( Shirley Eaton ) dying after being covered from head to foot in gold paint, the golf game, the car chase around Goldfinger's factory and, of course, the infamous laser beam sequence. Great dialogue here as 007 literally talks his way out of a particularly horrible death.This was the first Bond to be directed by Guy Hamilton. He brought a lighter tone to the series, one that perfectly suited the material. 'Goldfinger' would be much emulated by other entries, particularly the Hamilton-directed 'Diamonds Are Forever', but these never successfully duplicated the original's blend of comedy and adventure. John Barry's score is one of his best; the title song by Leslie Bricusse, Anthony Newley and Barry is given a powerhouse rendition by the great Shirley Bassey, and remains one of the most instantly recognisable '60's film themes.'Goldfinger' set the gold standard ( sorry about that! ) for Bond movies, and some say ( not me. I thought 'Thunderball' was better ) it has never been bettered.",Goldfinger
47,JamesHitchcock,As Close to Perfection as the Bond Series Gets,9,3 July 2013,"In his third cinematic adventure, James Bond travels to Miami Beach, Switzerland and Kentucky in order to thwart an audacious scheme by Auric Goldfinger, a wealthy businessman and bullion dealer, to raid America's gold reserves at Fort Knox. In most Bond films from the sixties the bad guys are from the international terrorist organisation SPECTRE, but here, as in a number of later films from the Moore and Brosnan eras, the villain is a megalomaniac business tycoon with ambitions for world domination. (Other examples include ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", ""Moonraker"", ""The World is not Enough"" and ""Die Another Day""). The title character is said to have been named after the architect Erno Goldfinger, whose modernist buildings Ian Fleming disliked; when the novel first appeared the notoriously humourless architect threatened to sue Fleming and his publishers. The film also introduced some other elements which were to become staples of later instalments in the series. It was not, as is sometimes stated, the first to have a theme song based on the movie's title (that was ""From Russia with Love""), but it was the first to feature a pre- credits opening sequence unconnected with the main story, and was the film which introduced Bond's fascination with technological gadgets, especially that iconic Aston Martin DB5 car. To this day, Aston Martin remains the marque most associated with Bond, even though he has driven many other cars in the course of his career. Many Bond villains, Charles Gray's Blofeld in ""Diamonds are Forever"" being a prime example, combine evil designs with an icily polite, almost gentlemanly demeanour. There is nothing of that about Auric Goldfinger who, despite all the trappings of his wealth, is quite obviously a crude thug with no pretensions to being a gentleman, except perhaps for his affectation of wearing plus-fours to play golf. His character is perhaps best shown by his blatant cheating at cards and his famous cry of ""No, Mr Bond, I expect you to die!"" Remarkably this character was created by a German actor, Gert Fröbe, who hardly spoke any English and whose voice had to be dubbed by another actor, Michael Collins. Collins's vocals, however, combine with Fröbe's body language to produce possibly the most memorable villain in the entire Bond franchise. The main Bond Girl in this film is Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore. (Fleming loved to use doubles entendres for the names of his heroines, but this must be the most blatant except perhaps for Plenty O'Toole). Pussy starts off as an ally of Goldfinger but is won over by Bond to his side. (A number of later films also turn upon Bond's ability to seduce the villain's female sidekicks). In the novel Pussy was a lesbian, until converted to heterosexuality by Bond, but this aspect of her character, for obvious reasons, could not be included in the film. In 1964 the Production Code was not quite dead. At 39 Honor was the oldest Bond Girl and in my view not really the most attractive when compared to others from this period such as Ursula Andress, Claudine Auger or her fellow- Avenger Diana Rigg. Yet she brought to the role immense charisma and a greater degree of acting ability than many subsequent Bond Girls. This is one woman, one feels, who is Bond's equal. Mention must be made of two actors playing what would normally be regarded as minor roles. Harold Sakata, a Japanese-American professional wrestler, plays Goldfinger's Korean manservant Oddjob, notable for his heavy build, prodigious strength and his habit of killing people by throwing his steel-rimmed bowler hat at them. The role is entirely mute, with no spoken dialogue, but Sakata is still able to invest his character with a malevolent, menacing personality. Shirley Eaton plays the secondary heroine Jill Masterson; although she is only on screen for a few minutes she has nevertheless become one of the more famous Bond Girls. Jill, of course, dies in the iconic scene where she is smothered in gold paint, one of a number of references to gold throughout the movie. For example, the name ""Auric"" is derived from ""aurum"", the Latin for gold, Goldfinger's car registration plate is ""AU 1"", ""Au"" being the chemical symbol for gold, and most of the female characters have golden- blonde hair. The film's one possible weakness is that, unlike some of the later Bonds, it does not contain any really heart-stopping action sequences. That apart, however, ""Goldfinger"" is one of the best of the series, probably my own personal favourite. Sean Connery is as cool and assured as ever, there are a memorable villain and a memorable Bond Girl and some excellent performances from the supporting cast, not just Eaton and Sakata, but also Bernard Lee as M. There is also plenty of humour- I especially liked the golf match and the scene where Bond frustrates Goldfinger's attempt to cheat at cards. This is about as close to perfection as the James Bond series gets. 9/10",Goldfinger
48,Smells_Like_Cheese,Who could resist James Bond?,7,15 August 2006,"Recently I was debating wither or not I should comment on the James Bond films, I would watch them all the time with my dad when I was a kid. But I haven't seen them in over a decade, so how could I comment on something I had no idea on wither truly it was a good film or not as an adult? So, I decided to go on another quest, this time, it's for James Bond, the whole collection. I started with from what I heard is the best, Goldfinger.It was fun watching this, because I am a fan of the Austin Powers trilogy, and I finally got a lot of the jokes. Not to mention just how fun it was to predict this movie, and it was in a fun way, believe me. Sean Connery is very cool and played a great James Bond. It was a little disturbing though, the way he treats women in these movies is sexist, but I'm not going to judge the film on that. Sadly, those were just different times.Goldfinger is a very cool action movie with great gadgets and a man, Goldfinger, who is trying to blow up the most expensive bank and rob it.

A man planning to attack Fort Knox and destroy the economy. Goldfinger is one of the best of the Bond films(if not THE best). Without the somewhat crazy plots and inventions which in some Bond movies got too far, Goldfinger delivers great acting and characters. 3 and a half/5 stars.",Goldfinger
50,MovieAddict2016,Best Bond movie ever.,10,7 May 2004,"Goldfinger could best be described as the quintessential, definitive Bond film, the first of the series to set the necessities of the entire saga in motion. It is also the best of the Bond movies, arguably the most suave and sophisticated, far superior to the Roger Moore era and those who followed in Connery's footsteps. It is the Bond ultimatum, so to speak.Goldfinger was the first of the iconic legacy to feature Q (Desmond Llewelyn) as a recurring comic relief figure. (He was introduced in From Russia with Love, the second film in the series, where he was credited as Major Boothroyd, and given little screen time.) It was also the first to truly setup the suave nature of 007, the tongue-in-cheek humor (absent in the first movie, Dr. No), the far-fetched gadgetry (including fast cars, this one being an Aston-Martin) and, arguably, the first of the series to feature the famous line, ""Bond, James Bond,"" as a 007 catchphrase, versus a mere line of dialogue. When Bond storms out onto the patio of the motel room, the camera zooms in towards his face, the 007 theme song roars through the speakers, and he says his motto with cool confidence. It's Bond, baby.Both of Goldfinger's predecessors were darker, more serious motion pictures -- more in-tune with the writing of Fleming versus the suaveness to later be salvaged from the series with the third installment. Although Dr. No was a terrific movie, and although From Russia with Love is exciting, Goldfinger beats them both. It features the best (and most famous) Bond villain to ever grace the screen, constantly spoofed in countless productions: Goldfinger (Gert Fröbe), the target of Austin Powers in Goldmember and, according to IMDb, referenced and spoofed in well over 100 other productions.There isn't much of a plot, really. Goldfinger plans to rob Fort Knox and become the richest man in the world. Bond finds out and tries to put a stop to his mission. What entices us, and what makes the film so entertaining despite the absurdity, is its leniency towards itself. It doesn't mind being silly because the entertainment value far outweighs any flaws. Plus, it has some of the most memorable scenes in history, and arguably the best Villain Explanation Scene to ever be recorded. ""Do you expect me to talk, Goldfinger?"" Bond (Sean Connery) asks as a laser beam slowly makes its way towards his groin. ""No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!"" he says with mock ridicule, before walking away. The following shots is one of the only sequences in James Bond history where the iconic character actually seems fairly worried that fate may be playing a deadly hand.Released in 1964, forty years later it stands as one of the most risqué Bond films to date. Especially for its time, there is brief nudity during the opening credits, sexual scenes, constant innuendo (including a Bond girl named ""Pussy Galore,"" played by Honor Blackman) and implications of lesbianism.Galore's sexual orientation is not delved into as deeply and explicitly as it may be dealt with in today's day and age, but the inclusion exists. Bond struggles verbally with Galore, trying to woo and seduce her, and she subtly implies from their very first meeting that she will not be seduced, claiming it is impossible for Bond to get very far with her, thereby insinuating that she is, in fact, a lesbian. According to the director of the film, Guy Hamilton, the entire situation is given much more emphasis in the novel by Ian Fleming, but it was simply too foul a subject for audiences back in 1964. Surprisingly, the verbal exchanges and implications behind the subject matter are much more effective.All of the actors in Goldfinger are, at the very least, very good. But of course, it is really Sean Connery who demands our utmost attention and respect, for it is Connery whose inhumanly strong screen presence launched Bond into the heights of Movie Legend.Recently in London I attended a James Bond exhibition, and as I made my way through a maze of Bond memorabilia and objects used in all twenty-something movies, I found myself realizing that the myth of 007 propels the films farther than anything else ever could. There is a sort of iconic legacy surrounding the entire Bond franchise that will probably never die. Different action heroes come and go, and nowadays Rambo looks criminally out of date, but Bond, in his black-and-white tuxedo, with all his suave sophistication, will never grow old, because he is a timeless hero who is comprised of all the greatest heroic attributes to ever be assembled, and although his style and looks may grow weary amid the changing ages, his character will remain the ultimate hero, and I very much doubt that we will ever live to see a day when Bond becomes outdated.",Goldfinger
51,DKosty123,Best of The Bonds,7,3 October 2006,"Goldfinger is always the film which is considered the best of the 007 series. In many ways it is. The action sequences are great. A lot of imagination went into using industrial laser the way it is used when the film was made. Gert Frobe does excellent service as Goldfinger. Honor Blackman is the only woman who could be considered Pussy Galore and still has me dreaming too. Harold Sakata (Oddjob) is one of the most dangerous second bananas in the series. The plot is about as grandiose as any plot in the series, involving Fort Knox. The plot in this film does not make any references to the ""Cold War"" which today no longer exists & this makes the plot hold up better. The only thing that seems to age in this are the mob men. The mob today has taken on a newer face than these cronies. All the regulars from Miss MoneyPenny to M to Q are in place on this ride. especially of interest to baby boomer's are the classic cars & the original Kentucky Fired Chicken Stand shown in the background of one sequence. The photography in this is lush which is a credit to Ted Moore & Guy Hamilton who does some of the best directing of the series. The music is great & besides Shirley Bassey title, listen for the great electric guitar instrumental of the title tune. This one is well worth viewing & a great introduction to the young folks of the series which made Sean Connery a film star whose had done other things, but for most of us, he will always be the best 007.",Goldfinger
52,lasttimeisaw,"Pussy galore honors black man, tell me this is not a double entendre!",6,3 July 2014,"This year marks GOLDFINGER's 50th anniversary, the third BOND film after Dr. No. (1962) and FROM Russia WITH LOVE (1963), however, it is my first encounter with Sean Connery's ironic Bond impersonation, but is this the best Bond film ever? Not in a million years, I daresay. Hiring a German actor (Fröbe) to play the kingpin Goldfinger with his Cantonese-babbling henchmen and a Korean muscle-man Oddjob (Sakata), the film's premise is not only politically incorrect and logically peculiar. Also, initially it might be glad to watch a Bond girl Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman) break the glass ceiling as a professional pilot and lead an all-female squad, it is utterly male chauvinistic to believe Bond's irresistible sexual appeal (and the off-screen sex activity) could magically convince her to a be a key turncoat within one day. Only if Bond were bisexual, it would solve more problems in the world. And persistently, Goldfinger would not even think about to kill Bond instantly since he is kept as a captive for most of the time, even in the most logical moment, there is always a morbid need to kill Bond in a fancy way with precisely ticking time. After 50 years, Aston Martin DB5 slightly loses its luster and the so-called cutting-edge gadgets' allure is also inevitably waning, but after all, it was a big-budget tent-pole at hen, John Barry's inherently engrossing score and Shirley Bassey's stunning theme song are timeless ear-worms. Unfortunately DP Ted Moore's epiphanic creativity (one innovative shot from the reflection of a woman's eyeball) does't find a larger room in the standard studio production line. Sean Connery is a perfect specimen of masculinity and debonair, and his unethical surrender to every attractive woman he meets panders for the taste of a majority of viewers who think beautiful flowers are either soon picked or just auxiliary for men's voyeurism. Honor Blackman actually reflects a definite amount of dignity and freshness in the earlier procedure, which makes her treachery evens more nonsensical. Gert Fröbe, takes up a considerable screen-time, yet fails to impress as a classic Bond villain not just because his clumsiness and genial appearance, he simply doesn't possess any kookiness to leave any traction. Director Guy Hamilton (EVIL UNDER THE SUN 1982, 7/10) would be a regular journeyman for Bond franchise (DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER 1971 and LIVE AND LET DIE 1973), and GOLDFINGER ultimately prompts the appreciation that what a boon SKYFALL (2012, 8/10) is, we have a Bond belongs to our own era, and we can witness the paradigm shift of the progress, days for cinephiles are getting better and better! If this is the highest achievement of a critic-acclaimed blockbuster 50 years ago could be, we should stop whining over most of our brainless equivalents with nostalgia, merely because the past is not so glamorous either.",Goldfinger
53,Red-Barracuda,High glamour and big excitement - Bond peaks here,9,22 September 2011,"The spy thriller originated as a peculiarly British genre both in literature and film. It prospered during times of war and political uncertainty. The 60's spy boom was partially a response to the cold war, a conflict where secret agents were on the front line protecting the west. The connections the genre had with imperialism also resonated in British society at a time of mass decolonisation. At a time when her empire was being dismantled, Britain became uncertain of her international standing. The spy film was one way of mythologising the national identity and allowing Brits once again to take centre stage in world affairs. From the beginning there were two types of this type of fiction. The realist strand focused on moral dilemmas, psychology and the seedier side of espionage. While the glamorised spy film was all about action and adventure; a place where espionage was a game and the world of the spy was replete with gadgets, girls and exotic locations. Clearly the latter offered escapism and high audiences; into this genre entered the Bond films. These movies brought the genre up-to-date while simultaneously looking backwards; while they had a libidinous amoral hero, were full of high-tech gadgetry and favoured action and style over characterisation and realism, they also were traditional in their imperial leanings. In the main though, they offered a very new type of cinematic entertainment. Bond was like no previous British hero. He was no stiff upper lipped English gentleman, he was more in line with the muscular American hero. He was a womaniser and he was violent. In Bond films, it is the villains who are the asexual ones. He was a very new type of British hero.Goldfinger is in many ways the perfect example of the Bond film. It eschewed the more realistic approach of the previous entry From Russia With Love and returned to the glossy imagery and detailed set design of Dr No. But Goldfinger was a much improved version of the Dr No template. For one thing Sean Connery was now at the peak of his game. His movie star charisma is used to the max here and his confidence in the role is considerable. Not only as an action star but he also handles the comedy side of things with some aplomb. He gets to spout a number of witty one liners and sarcastic comments and they do work very well at adding to the Bond persona. The character Auric Goldfinger himself is possibly the best villain the series produced; Gert Fröbe is excellent in the role, hard to believe he was dubbed throughout. Harold Sakata is unforgettable as his side-kick Oddjob. The ladies are the usual variety of hot women that seem to exist everywhere in Bond's orbit. Honor Blackman's Pussy Galore has real chemistry with Connery, while the gold painted Shirley Eaton remains one of the most iconic Bond girls ever. Stylistically, Goldfinger brims with visual flair, while the set designs are truly something to behold throughout. And as for the Shirley Bassey theme song, well the word timeless springs to mind.This movie has all the glamour and excitement you could possibly hope for in a James Bond film. It typifies the genre and remains to this day a great action film.",Goldfinger
54,KineticSeoul,Iconic secret agent in one of his iconic films,7,27 January 2016,"This movie is a stand out film in the 007 franchise probably because like some reviewers are claiming, it elevates 007 to Pop Phenomena. Maybe it's because of the gadgetry, the over the top sequences, a iconic scene that has a laser in it that got parodied many times and over. Never the less this is a classic Bond movie where Sean Connery came into his own as James Bond. There is quite a bit of classic Bond scenarios and parts in this. Despite this being more campy than the previous two movies in this franchise. One of the Bond girl's name is Pussy Galore for crying out loud and even has Goldfinger's henchman named Oddjob that throws his flying hat to decapitate people with it. Overall this is a campy James Bond movie that I didn't really get into or found it all that entertaining. But it did have it's amusing moments and again, I do appreciate this film for what it is and what it accomplished in the 60's.7.5/10",Goldfinger
55,OllieSuave-007,"Shaken, not stirred!",6,3 March 2014,"Sean Connery's third outing as James Bond 007 is chock-full of gun-totting action, Bond girls, peculiar villains and surprises. Bond's next mission takes him to Fort Knox, where Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) and his henchman are planning to raid Fort Knox, to the expense of the World's economy.Bond's mission to save the world is one somewhat thrilling ride as he dodges the killer hat of lead henchman Oddjob (Harold Sakata), wrestle with ace pilot Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman) and show-off in the classic and gadget-equipped Bondmobile, the Ashton Martin. There are more suspense and action, though, that I remembered from the previous two films. This movie is mostly all-talk and suffers from, unfortunately, lack of action (mostly from Bond), excitement and formidable villains (Goldfinger is not a force to be reckoned with). The plot is also pretty slow, with the golf scene being extremely boring. One bright side, though, is that this movie also features the iconic Bond girl Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton), all painted in gold, and the legendary sultry title song, Goldfinger, brilliantly sung by Shirley Bassey. The song will instantly remind you that this is a Bond film. It's a more average 007 adventure, where Bond first utters his famous catchphrase, ""shaken, not stirred."" Grade C",Goldfinger
56,thesar-2,Golden Touch...Finally,8,3 March 2013,"Wowand to think I almost gave up on the old Bond after finishing From Russia with Love. But, I somehow knew it would get better and long before the modern Bond that I prefer.Goldfinger, while silly at spots and anti-woman Bond was in full swing, was fun, adventurous, started with a bang, had decent action, the best theme song – so far, hilarious at spots, depth and shortened and tight, finally. In fact, even though this is only Part III, this is the closest to the newest Bond adventures of the original three. And that's a good thing for one that grew up on Dalton and Brosnan.I think they finally realized, while the first two might be closer to reality, that's not what we go to the movies for. So, in turn, Connery finally does more than just smirk to get through this chapter. He begins the movie with a raid, a dame, some fights, explosions and funny lines. He continues with a holiday turned small mission that turns into something moregolden.After his 5-minute love affair turns for the worst, he's set to spy on tycoon Goldfinger, played wonderfully by Gert Fröbe, and spends most of the movie side-by-side with him. That, I liked. It was nice seeing the visible villain and hero sharing the same space.Likewise, I adored the best Bond girl to date with the best Bond girl name to date: Pussy Galore (a delicious Honor Blackman.) They finally gave not one, but two (including Shirley Eaton as rifle-toting Jill Masterson) Bond girls spines.Oh, and last but not least we have the hilariously bad Oddjob (Harold Sakata) who immediately reminded me of the shoe-throwing villain in Austin Powers. And I said ""not least"" because I have to shout out for the machine-gun-granny-guard. She was great.Bond's not undercover, but captive while he tries to thwart and outsmart Goldfinger's evil plan. It's a fun and action packed (at least, for 1965) adventure that, if this would have been my first introduction to Bond, I would be a fan for life.Some of the lines were extremely memorable and fun, the gadgets present, the theme was nicely taken from the good title track and the cinematography very good – especially the Alps and the car chase, from the outside, that is. It's not perfect, and a little hokey for today's standards, but I still had a ball and I'd say see this one, definitely.(This is my Bondathon series leading up to 2012's James Bond Part XXIII: Skyfall. I will be including the ""odd one out"": Never Say Never Again just to get the whole experience. That said, I am skipping both the 50-minute Made-for-TV film and the original spoof, 1967's Casino Royale because...I still have some dignity.)",Goldfinger
57,Robert_duder,Complete return to Bond greatness...the best so far hands down,9,15 April 2008,"Goldfinger is generally considered the classic and the greatest Bond and I would, to this point, tend to agree. I think even the film makers agreed at the time that From Russia With Love (see my review) was not one of the best sequels so they put their everything into redemption and redemption they get hands down!! The story is hot and completely riveting and James Bond is back in full form!! It's the perfect ensemble of Bond, Bond girl, master mind villain and the best henchman ever. Goldfinger, I think, set the bar for any future Bond installments and really made sure that they would all judge themselves against this one to make sure they all meet the same level of quality. New director Guy Hamilton takes the helm and he easily shows up the work of Terrance Young from the previous films. He knows how to really draw you into the story and create this really terrific spy caper flick. This one takes the story into our own backyard by bringing it into the United States. The women are beautiful, the money is endless, and Bond is in full form as never before. This is definitely my favorite Bond film to date.Sean Connery returns once again and shows exactly what made him the perfect choice in Dr. No. He completely embodies James Bond and makes him exactly what he is. Whereas I found his Bond in From Russia With Love, a little harsh and maybe even mean, sarcastic Bond, he returns in Goldfinger with this cocky, egotistical, suave, dangerous super spy and I love every minute of it. He spends a lot of time captured in the movie but still makes being a prisoner looks good. Gert Fröbe is the appropriately slimy Auric Goldfinger. He is the polar opposite of Bond in every way...he's sleazy, uncouth, portly, stocky and the perfect adversary to Bond. He is diabolical and we love to see him get his just end against Bond. Honor Blackman plays the infamous Pussy Galore (the first Bond girl to get a name that has the double sexual entendre that becomes a staple to the series.) She is feisty and strong and seems thwart Connery's charms at first. His final victory over her is a little taboo considering he pins her down and forces himself on her but to the sixties generation that was sexy I suppose? Harold Sakata is the one and only Oddjob, the infamous henchman that keeps Bond in check at every turn. Their lengthy battle in the end of the film is memorable and a lot of fun. As always Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell make their obligatory cameos in the film as well.Everyone just makes a really good performance and the story is easy to follow and a lot of fun. It adds the best elements of spy thriller with a caper type film as Goldfinger attempts to rob the one and only Fort Knox. Now I will say that I think Goldfinger took being campy to a whole new level and yet it works for the film. The scene where the entire military drops unconscious to Goldfinger's gas is completely laughable and yet almost disturbing at the same time. I also thought it was very clever that when you thought it was all over you get one last terrific battle between Bond and Goldfinger and his end is classic and the perfect death for a villain of his stature. Hands down my favorite Bond film and you must see this one if not any other one. It will keep you riveted and teach you exactly why James Bond is the classic Hollywood character that he is. 9/10",Goldfinger
58,Lejink,Bond's best,9,18 December 2011,"For me this is the pinnacle of the whole Bond franchise, a superbly paced escapist action thriller which avoids the sometimes longueurs of ""Dr No"" and ""From Russia With Love"" which preceded it and the gimmickry and knowingness of its myriad successors.That fantastic, booming theme song by Shirley Bassey helps no end too. From there on it's a winning mix of sexiness, excitement and humour as Bond squares up to one of his very best nemeses, Auric Goldfinger, indeed it's a shame that unlike Blofeld, there was no way back from his demise here, never mind his silent henchman Oddjob. The great scenes just pile up from the start, including the first encounter with Goldfinger and the genuinely shocking death of Shirley Eaton, then the equally famous golf match at Stoke Poges, Bond's capture and subsequent encounter with Goldfinger's laser, which includes my favourite piece of dialogue from the whole series, Goldfinger's ""No, Mr Bond, I expect you to die!"" Later we're introduced to Honor Blackman's impossibly-named Pussy Galore, one of the sexiest Bond girls, moreover as 007 has to overcome her apparent frigidity, although my only qualm with the plotting is the too-easy way she betrays her boss after succumbing to James' s aggressive advances.There's a fantastic fight scene with Oddjob too, before the final resolution at Fort Knox, prefiguring the large-scale finish of almost every subsequent Bond movie ever since. Connery's in his absolute element here and Gert Frobe is excellent too as Goldfinger, while Harold Sakata conveys twice as much menace without saying a word compared to, say, Richard Kiel's ""Jaws"" years later.This is the Bond movie where it really all clicked into place and never quite would in the same way again. It's timeless in my estimation, I never tire of watching it.",Goldfinger
59,ElMaruecan82,"Action and Seduction-wise, the Bond that will leave everyone shaken... and not stirred...",9,14 October 2016,"Here's a little test: think of ""Dr. No"", which images immediately come to your mind? I suspect it's a tie between bikini-clad Ursula Andress making her iconic entrance in the beach and the first shot of James Bond, lighting his cigarette with that cool and deadpan expression while introducing for the first time the classic ""Bond. James Bond."" And now, just think of a third image. You might have many shots and lines flooding over your memory but to call them iconic would be a stretch. Now, do exactly the same test with ""Goldfinger"". What images come to tout mind? Is it Bond in white tuxedo looking at the exotic dancer while lighting a cigarette (and something else in the process) or is it Bond wearing that blue polo in Miami Beach and introducing himself to Jill Masterson (a shot featured in Spielberg's film ""Catch Me If You Can"")? Is it the first shot at the Aston Martin, Pussy Galore or Auric Goldfinger playing cards or briefing about his plan? Speaking of Goldfinger, maybe it is the opening song, the staple to all James Bond opening credits? Or that shocking sight of a dead woman painted in gold? Or how about a special drink ordered by 007 in a plane? I can go on and on, from the deadly hat trick of Oddjob, the mute Korean right- hand man, the car chase or the classic laser pointing at perhaps Bond's most vulnerable spot.""Goldfinger"" is just full of unforgettable images, one after another, that all contributed to build the legend of 007, if ""Dr. No"" was the starter, this one is the sure thing, the one you can show to someone who never saw any James Bond. It just creates the perfect 'bond' with old or new fans, now what is the secret? I think the secret is in the title; the film is as much about Bond as it is about the villain, wonderfully played by Gert Fröbe. One of the most common tropes about Bond is that the villain's identity is revealed a bit later but ""Goldfinger"" follows the principle that a story is as good as its villain. Auric Goldfinger, the man with the deadly Midas touch, is a rather mundane and not intimidating gold investor, but beware of his hubris, this is a businessman who means business. The first scene shows him cheating at cards and it says a lot about him, he wants to get rich the easy way, and it's not about the quantity but the value, too. So, we clearly see from the first shocking death what this man is capable of to whoever steps in his territory, and it's surprising how many times Bond is actually disarmed by Goldfinger or his henchmen. But you know the pattern of Bond movies, Bond never dies and the villain never kills him whenever he has the opportunity, the trick is to make it believable, and for some reason, if Goldfinger isn't immune to the villain's monologue accusation, the fact that he was painted as a three-dimensional character makes it believable that he'd rather keep James Bond prisoner and show off about his clever high-scale plans, than killing him and leave his secret plan unknown. And you can tell how delighted Bond is to tickle Goldfinger's ego and let him reveal more of his scheme. In fact, you can also tell, that Connery has fun playing Bond, after two performances, he mastered it enough and knows exactly when to play it cool and when to play it tough.This is not the kind of film where performances are to be praised, but I've been so admiring of Connery's 'presence' in ""Dr. No"" that I think he deserves a few mentions here. Connery has a capability to find the right tone for the right moment, in a scene when he tries to break out of jail, look at the way he teases the guard, smiles at him and plays hide-and-seek, this is not out of character, this is a secret agent who also knows how to play a role. But look at his frightened expression when he see the gold-painted Jill or when he stares at that ominous laser, these are genuine moments where he can't really pull the tough guy facade. There are two Bonds playing, the secret agent and the man, and the trick is to always keep a fine line between both and when it comes to women, it's a whole different story.Bond is a man who seduces as much as is being seduced, and on that level, he's rather self-conscious, but he loves to play the game nonetheless and deliver his lines as if he really had to show more than his pretty face and athletic looks, there's got to be that little icing on the cake, the woman has to play 'hard to get', it's part of the game, and never has a preliminary been as sensual as the karate contest in the barn. The music is playful like a little interlude except that it plays on strength, on fighting skills as if Bond had to maintain his manly reputation on that level, as if Pussy Galore needed more than the little charming rhapsody. And why not, she's perhaps the most bad-ass Bond Girl, she flies a plane, leads a commando and she doesn't need to be naked to assert her sexiness, she's quite a match for Bond and she's one of the reasons the film works.In fact, I don't think of any Bond movies that succeed on every level: Bond, the villains, the girls, the song, the lines, the spectacular action, the high-scale super villain's scheme, everything. This is why ""Goldfinger"" is the film that really established Connery as the ultimate Bond. If only for ""Goldfinger"", Connery could never be matched. Action and seduction-wise, this is a Bond that would leave anyone shaken not stirred.",Goldfinger
60,bowmanblue,Gold standard Bond,8,28 July 2014,"Dr No was good, From Russia With Love was great, but the third Connery offering really set the standard for future Bond movies. It really does have everything: one of the most memorable henchmen ('Oddjob'), a villain with some of the most evil lines ever, ""No, Mr Bond, I expect you to DIE!"" and girls with the most - how should I put it? - interesting names, i.e. 'Pussy Galore.' Really, what more do you want from a Bond film? Whether you're watching it alone for the action, or as part of a Saturday afternoon family viewing, it works for everyone. It centres around a megalomaniac gold dealer, Goldfinger to be precise, and his attempts at destroying the U.S.'s gold reserves in Fort Knox. Obviously, Bond has something to say about this and sets about stopping him. It's also the first Connery Bond film that doesn't rely on 'Spectre' as the bad guys, proving that Bond doesn't need his arch enemy to make a good adventure.If you like how Bond used to be before the 'seriousness' of the Daniel Craig era then Goldfinger is the pinnacle of Connery's time in the Aston Martin's hotseat and, even after all these years, is still up there with the best of Bond's output.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Goldfinger
61,ThomasDrufke,Heart of Gold,9,25 September 2015,"The franchise began with two relatively dark films in Dr. No & From Russia With Love, Goldfinger continues that trend, but adds plenty of fun moments with much more spectacle than before. In my quest to watch all of the James Bond films (at least the ones I hadn't already seen) before November's Spectre, Goldfinger has proved to be one of my favorites. It's a great balance of dark stakes & consequences meeting tongue and cheek humor and spectacle. But we also get everything we loved from the first two films. Beautiful women, fancy cars, great villains, and plenty of bullets. To add to that, Goldfinger gave us the best sidekick yet, in Oddjob, and women who are more than capable of holding their own out in the field. The film still has its fair share of iffy sexism moments, but I was pleased to see the women become more of a presence in the field rather than being Bond's sex objects.We begin with Bond tasked to take down a man who goes by Goldfinger. His life quite literally revolves around gold. Everything he has is shaded gold all the way down to his golf clubs. His plan, much like so many other villains, involves mass destruction and killings. I was a bit disappointed to see that the group Spectre had no part in Goldfinger, especially after their memorable presence and tease at the end of From Russia With Love. But Auric Goldfinger holds his own as a very prominent villain. In fact, this is the second straight Bond movie where its very clear the bad guys have the upper hand. It's one of the reasons I loved the film is it's constant unpredictability. Not only with it's villains, but even with its supporting characters. A few times throughout the film I thought a character was going to be a bigger part of the story but that quickly ended. Shoutout to Shirley Eaton for being one of the most iconic Bond girls, but also Tania Mallet for being an Audrey Hepburn lookalike. Speaking of iconic Bond girls, the memorably titled Pussy Galore is featured heavily here as well. Yes, the name is enticing, but the character is well handled. She's probably my favorite Bond girl thus far.So after an amazing opening credits sequence, Goldfinger is perhaps the most entertaining Bond film to date (minus the Craig films). We get tons of new gadgets, more teases with moneypenny, a helluva sidekick, a few great Bond girls, and one despicable villain. The stunts are also much better than the previous films as the budget was doubled this time out. Goldfinger was the first true Bond blockbuster, and set the franchise on bigger and broader road for the better or worse.+Goldfinger is for real+Oddjob is awesome+Bond girls are handled more tastefully+Gadgets & stunts improved9.0/10",Goldfinger
62,gbill-74877,Classic Bond,8,9 October 2019,"What's cool about this Bond film is the novelty of the ways his nemesis, a gold magnate by the name of Auric Goldfinger (Gert Fröbe), has of killing people. He dramatically kills one of Bond's lovers (Shirley Eaton) by having his henchman apply gold paint over her entire body, causing her to die of ""skin suffocation."" His manservant Oddjob (Harold Sakata) has a killer bowler hat and is capable of crushing a golf ball with his bare hand. And of course, he has that industrial laser, which he threatens to slice Bond in half with, starting from his groin (of course!) and then moving upwards.Bond (Sean Connery) is not without tools of his own though. In this one Q gives him an Aston Martin sports car with all sorts of fun modifications, including a passenger ejection mechanism, the ability to spew smoke, bullets, or an oil slick depending on the situation, and a sharp spear that allows him to shred the tires of his enemies (and which seems lifted from the chariot race in Spartacus). He's also Bond, James Bond, of course. Connoisseur of alcohol, ultra-smooth with women, and always so cool and level-headed. Even when criticized for not bringing Q's gadgets back intact, he simply quips ""you'd be surprised how much wear and tear goes on out there in the field."" He plays a little cat and mouse game with Goldfinger, and I liked the scenes in the first half where he foils the gin rummy con Goldfinger is running, and then plays golf with him.We see a little bit of vulnerability in Bond in this film, not that we're ever really worried about what the outcome is going to be. He makes a couple of missteps and gets caught and dumped in prison. Actually, maybe his first misstep is in dissing the Beatles. He says, ""My dear, some things just aren't done, such as drinking Dom Pérignon '53 above a temperature of 38 degrees Fahrenheit. That's as bad as listening to the Beatles without earmuffs."" Oops. (and Jeez he's kind of a pompous ass sometimes isn't he?)Bond cycles through women leading eventually to the most outrageously named character in movie history, Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman). It's cool that she's tough, a pilot, and has trained a squadron of other pilots (all blondes, lol), but perhaps less cool in that she gives in to him when he overpowers her after a judo match in the hay. Along the way there are a bevy of other objectified beauties, e.g. an exotic dancer (Nadja Regin), a masseuse (Margaret Nolan), an escort (Shirley Eaton), and a stewardess (Mai Ling), all in addition to a parade of women in bikinis in the background during the opening scenes.The film suffers a little from pace and structural problems with the heist on Ft. Knox in its back half. I mean, why kill all those mobsters after showing them the plan with the high-tech multimedia presentation? And why not kill Bond; why is he so valuable they need to bring him along? But the film is always entertaining, and it's interesting that Bond gets by on his wits and by keeping cool, as opposed to brute strength. Clearly the franchise had hit full stride by this 3rd installment, and this one has an aura of not only a classic 007 film, but also a genre-defining film with all of its cool spy elements.",Goldfinger
63,cricketbat,The Bond film with the Midas touch,8,20 January 2020,"When it comes to James Bond movies, it's hard to do better than Goldfinger. From the gadgets to the villains to the Bond girls, this film has it all. Auric Goldfinger is a fantastic foil to the tough, yet vulnerable 007, and his evil plot is actually quite clever. There are parts of this movie that seem completely ridiculous when watching it over 50 years after it was made, but I think that's part of Goldfinger's charm. It's no wonder this film was a smash hit.",Goldfinger

It's certainly not a perfect movie, it has many flaws and also has the same cheesy dialogue that all the Bond films suffered with in the 1960's and 1970's, but it's still a very enjoyable movie with some of the most memorable scenes in Bond history, such as the laser scene and of course the villain himself, Goldfinger. Sean Connery is at the top of his game in this movie, portraying Bond with pure confidence and class, I never felt he was the greatest Bond, but from watching this I can see why many others do. Action packed and a ton of fun, Goldfinger is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good action or adventure film. 007 is assigned to investigate the evil empire of Auric Goldfinger and discover what they are up to.

65,A_Different_Drummer,apogee,9,30 August 2020,"FROM RUSSIA was the more entertaining film. But Goldfinger added new tones and beats. shamelessly copied in the dozen that followed. Over the years the franchise would devolve into mainly SFX and bad jokes, followed by Connery swearing he would never do another. (HA!) But this was the best of the best.",Goldfinger
66,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Cheap-ass, simplistic Bond bore.",6,1 August 2007,"I know I'm just asking to be hauled over the coals for this, but Goldfinger is surely one of the dullest Bond films. I am not some cheeseburger junkie brought up on Die Another Day and xXx, before you make that assumption. But I found Goldfinger to be tolerable only because it was rather short for a Bond film and had a villain who was somewhat likable instead of a despicable super-arch-nemesis living in a volcano lair.Despite the fact that this film apparently cost more to make then the first two Bond films combined it is so amazingly cheap you could be fooled into thinking it they filmed it all for free. First of all, Sean Connery is obviously never outside of Pinewood Studios (or the nearby, surrounding countryside) since every time he appears 'on location' it's ridiculously fake-looking rear-projection. My God, if you're going to make a spy movie in a franchise that sells itself on globe-trotting how about actually having your actor BE there! The locations, as a result, are all low-key and not much to look at. The gold-melting plant in Geneva, for example, is blatantly an anonymous alleyway out the back of Pinewood. I was never really one for the silly gadget's in Bond film's either, so I'm glad that they never played a big part in the story and the stuff that he did use (homing devices) were believable. But don't get me started about the car! Why, why, why do people always cream their panties over these inane Bond cars? Let me tell you something; the Aston Martin is lamest thing I have ever seen, I wouldn't be seen dead in one and it irritates the hell out of me that they keep cropping up in this series. And that's even WITH Q's cunning extras. The Goldfinger Aston Martin spawned a die-cast toy car that's worth zillions on E-Bay these days and is worth even more if you have the box (why would you) with the ejector seat still intact. Wow...the ejector seat. Such a big deal is made out of this but I swear the guy Bond launches out of his car soars a whopping one foot in the air. Adventure doesn't get any bigger than THAT huh? Despite it's undeserved praise as a classic and a definitive Bond film, Goldfinger is clearly a rush-job with an Oddjob. This was Connery's third Bond film (as well as others) in two years. If they took a little more time and effort and delivered something with more sophisticated framing and effects then Goldfinger could have been worthy of being called a classic. As it is it's merely a fond childhood event for a lot of older adults who are unable to see how naff it is since they can only view it through nostalgic goggles.",Goldfinger

68,tabuno,"Aging, Sexist but Still Relevant and Entertaining",7,3 February 2019,"Sean Connery in his third go around as the original James Bond offers up some lingering contemporary ideas including dirty bombs, miniaturized homing devices, industrial lasers. The action is sustained and the thrills and the electrifying music still resonate. The movie isn't without its aging weaknesses in regards to sexist innuendos, stereotypical criminal gangsters, and some remarkably stilted death sequences. Interestingly this movie begins to lay the foundation for Bond's uneasy relationship with authority and his involvement in the death of innocents, particularly women, which will come back to haunt in future films. Overall, the movie remains entertaining and watchable.",Goldfinger
69,kenjha,The Gold Standard,8,29 September 2007,"After a couple of lukewarm efforts, the third entry in the series is a slam-bang adventure from start to finish. Connery seems more comfortable as Bond than in the earlier films. Blackman is not only one of the most beautiful Bond girls, but Pussy Galore is perhaps the best of all Bond girl names. Frobe is the first of the great Bond villains and Sakata is a hoot as the hat-wielding Oddjob. The plot is far-fetched and full of holes, but that comes with the territory in a Bond film. The witty dialog has some memorable lines. This one provides Bond with his ultimate gadget: the fully loaded car that you can't pickup at your local Aston Martin dealer.",Goldfinger
70,The-Sarkologist,Pussy Galore and Oddjob - Need I Say More,9,3 March 2012,"This is the third of the James Bond films and we can see here how the franchise is coming together. This time Bond is not up against SPECTRE, but rather against a wealthy bullion dealer who is just not satisfied with his gold holdings so he wants to twist the odds in his favour by irradiating pretty much all of Fort Knox. It is interesting though when we consider what the price of gold would have been in 1964 ($35.00 US) and what it is now ($1600 US). All Auric Goldfinger needed to do was simply wait 40 years, but then again patience is generally not the virtue of a supervillian, particularly since they want to take over the world.Anyway, we are introduced to Q-Branch and actually begin to see the numerous gadgets that make James Bond famous (there were no gadgets in Dr No, but they were introduced in From Russia with Love, being the attache case). Major Boothroy, who does appear in the first two movies, is also first referred to a Q in this film. However the one thing that we are also introduced to that made a friend of mine drool, is the Aston Martin (it replaced the Bentley, though we only saw the Bentley for a bit in From Russia with Love, but we get the impression that Bond is somewhat attached to it).Now this is a classic James Bond movie. James Bond is played by Sean Connery, who just falls into the character. He is not a tough guy, though he does fight with his fists, and even though there is a machine-gun fight at the end, the action does not dominate the movie. Was is most striking is the subtle humour of Bond's character, which is lost in the new movies. Connery, and to an extent, Moore, really made Bond. Goldfinger is about a man, Aurik Goldfinger, who is obsessed with gold. It starts of seeming that he is smuggling gold to make money, but it lands up that he has an even more sinister plot to increase the value of his gold. Plot wise, it is rather simple, but it is the other effects that make it quite good. The subtle jokes, and sexual innudendoes, are quite interesting. The main one is one of the Bond women, whose name is Pussy Galore. I won't say anything further about that. Of course, Bond sleeps with two women, but this is expected in these early Bond movies. Still, it is a characteristic of Bond that works here but becomes clichéd later on. There isn't much else to comment on with this movie, as it is just a simple Bond film, but it is one that is good. Odd Job is one of the famous Bond villains. The uniqueness is his hat which can cut the head off a statue is pretty scary. It is also interesting to note that all of Goldfinger's henchmen are Asian. This is revealed later that he is involved with the Chinese. It is also interesting to note that all of Pussy Galore's pilots are females. Anyway, this movie goes down as classic James Bond and it is probably the movie where James Bond actually comes of age, though the one cool thing about this movie is the tag line – everything he touches turns to excitement.",Goldfinger

72,slightlymad22,The Best Bond To Date,9,4 May 2017,"Goldfinger (1964)Plot In A Paragraph: James Bond (Connery) uncovers a plot to contaminate the Fort Knox gold reserve. GOOOOLLLLDDDDFINGEEERRRRRRRR.... He's the man. The man with the Midas touch!! Almost everybody's favourite Connery Bond movie. From the pre credits scene, where Bond uses a woman as a human shield before electrocuting an assassain, through Shirley Basseys glorious title track to the finale, the pace of Goldfinger never lets up. Goldfinger was easily the best bond movie to date, far superior to From Russia with Love and more professional than Dr. No. The action was more exciting, the pace faster and the script was funnier too. It also included two classic Bond moments, a shot of murdered Shirley Eaton, covered in heavy gold paint and secondly Connery himself spread eagled on a metal bench, a laser beam cutting between his legs, advancing slowly on his private parts.The bad guy Goldfinger (Gert Forb) and his hench man Odd Job (Harold Sakata) were the best to date, and so was the car!! The bulletproof Aston Martin, which included a reader, machine gun headlamps collar tire slashing knives, smokescreens, flamethrowers, oil slicks and the famous ejector seat. Honour Blackman is a joy as the delightfully named Pussy Galore (""I must be dreaming"") The best Bond to date also have Connery his highest grossing movie, and best performing one too!! As Goldfinger grossed $51 million at the domestic Box Office to end the year the 2nd highest grossing movie of 1964. Only My Fair Lady starring Audrey Hepburn outgrossed it.",Goldfinger

74,Rodrigo_Amaro,Solid Gold,10,24 April 2017,"""Goldfinger"" isn't the beginning of James Bond franchise, neither is the greatest 007 film but the film is responsible for the achievement of making a statement to the world of film: Bond is here to stay. During those 50 years, the franchise has expanded into a magnificent and spectacular world, part of our vocabulary, with many defining elements to pop culture with its theme songs; the remarkable introduction followed by Monty Norman's now classic tune; the cars and the gadgets; the villains and the Bond girls; and obviously the most famous secret agent of our time. Sean Connery's third film of the bunch and his highest moment in the series paved the way for everyone else who followed his footsteps in playing 007. What's special about ""Goldfinger"" is that with this third entry the Broccoli/Saltzman team had defined exactly what they wanted to achieve with the Bond films and what audiences could expect with them: action, adventure, lots of humor, some romance and puzzling plots. It's not like ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia with Love"" didn't have those but with this 1964 film everything was made to a perfected level of quality, with a precise rhythm - even though the franchise managed to sink a little bit.Here, 007 has a mission to follow the millionaire/megalomaniac Goldfinger (Gert Frobe), a gold fanatic man who plans to commit the crime of the century by robbing all the gold from Fort Knox and cause an economical collapse in America. Assisted by his loyal silent henchman Odd Job (Harold Sakata) and his killing hat; and the armed and dangerous beauty Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman), the villain has the perfect plan to reach his goal...but as always, Bond gets in the way to destroy his masterplan. On the other side, 007 gets some help by agent Felix Leiter (Cec Linder) and for the first time (officially) he receives high-tech gadgets from Q (Desmond Llewelyn - he was in ""From Russia With Love"" as a character named Boothroyd, which is Q's name). Bond gets a brand new car (Aston Martin's debut) filled with explosives, ejecting seats and other marvels of technology that as usual will never be returned in good state. It's all good. Guy Hamilton's first Bond film (he made three more) is an exemplary one. Concise, objective and well balanced, with a mission that isn't over-complicated and its crazy enough to make us believe in it. His direction of actors is superb - even though Frobe is dubbed by another actor but his presence is more than effective - and his management to control aspects of a film mustn't be overlooked at all. Forget about the clichés, or the dated special effects and some poor editing tricks (the plane sequence at the end is quite cheesy) but focus on the fact that the majority of the story takes in the United States yet nothing was filmed there. It's all created in the Pinewood studios, and a replica of Fort Knox was built to a wonderful degree of accuracy that even a higher official from the actual place congratulated the film's team for their great research. That is pure talent.They formed great basis for the future 007 films by creating a spectacle that always had the challenge of going to longer distance, one more spectacular than the previous one, a way to top themselves and deliver something special. This one includes memorable lines (""No, Mr. Bond I expect you to die!"" while the agent is about to get torn apart by a laser device), memorable sequences (Pussy Galore and Bond fighting in the barn) and plenty of great thrills (Bond vs. Odd Job is the most awaited moment). But the iconic image that defined ""Goldfinger"" was Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton) painted in gold. And the theme song by Shirley Bassey is solid gold, one of the first Bond themes to become a mega-hit and one that established the presence of top rock n'roll/pop musicians of the moment to perform a song for the franchise.In all possible seriousness of the world, I urge to go through the whole franchise, from Connery to Craig, from the humble beginnings of ""Doctor No."" to the rich exuberance of ""Spectre"", and try to see the Bond evolution and how some of its trademarks are so nostalgic and important that they must not leave the franchise ever - sometimes it happens but the result always gives us a troubling experience almost as if we're not seeing a complete Bond film. ""Goldfinger"" still hasn't lost its golden touch and can appeal to future audiences to come. 10/10",Goldfinger

76,zkonedog,A Bond Movie With A Little Bit Of Everything,8,3 March 2017,"The James Bond movie franchise is often characterized by wild shifts in tone. For example, the seriousness of the Connery years quickly turned into the goofiness of the Moore era. The best films are the ones that combine the ""best of both worlds"". ""Goldfinger"" walks that fine line and turns in one of the better installments of the series.For a basic plot summary, ""Goldfinger"" sees James Bond (Sean Connery) come up against Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe), a business tycoon obsessed with gold with designs on completely destroying the world's economy for his own personal gain.This movie works so well because it does all the intangible things perfectly. For example, the ""Bond...James Bond"" line is used to perfection, the opening title music is some of the best ever, and the soundtrack throughout punctuates the action perfectly. Also helping matters is the fact that the plot isn't too over-the-top, but still crazy enough to produce some romping adventure. The girls and gadgets are omni-present.About the only reason I can't give ""Goldfinger"" a full five stars is a personal one, because technologically it has easily been surpassed by later efforts. The Bond movies have always lent themselves to being easily improved by better movie technology, so the earlier efforts like this one sometimes feel a bit ""slow"" compared to nowadays.Overall, though, ""Goldfinger"" is a fun Bond effort that holds up better than most of the older Bond efforts. It does all the ""little Bond stuff"" right, and even throws in a decent plot and endearing characters.",Goldfinger
77,johnnyboyz,"The filmic explosion which pioneered a franchise and popularised a canon - a ""Golden Touch"" indeed.",7,17 July 2013,"For many, Goldfinger is the beginning of Bond. To an extent, it is, but only in that it epitomises everything the franchise would later go on to try and capitalise upon when the time came to preordain narratives encompassing gadgetry, cars, women and locations as a means of delivering something engrossing and adult, but with a specific sheen of glamour and sex appeal. There is not, of course, anything glamorous or sexy about apocalyptic plots; life or death situations and the tension over whether a certain contraption will work to its full capacity when one needs it to. There was an innocence to Dr. No that somebody somewhere down the line mistook for what should constitute as rigid mainstream formula: an innocence, in as much it took place on Jamaica not because Jamaica is lush and exotic but because author Ian Fleming happened to know the place rather well; an innocence in the eventual heroine not emerging from the sea in her bikini because it's an alluring and attractive thing to have a woman wear, but out of the fact one does not expect anyone to wear anything else upon swimming in the sea, and abused it to the extent that it ended up being everything people wanted.While a good film all by itself, Goldfinger is essentially representative of a more populist approach to spy thrillers; something which the producers lucked out in happening upon before cocking up entirely with their next two entries anyway. The film is closer to Dr. No than it is to From Russia With Love. Lacking both the narrative complexities as well as the general Cold War element of the latter, the film is more interested in depicting a straighter tale of heroes and villains along with the general deception that hovers around as a plot is uncovered and Bond is allowed to integrate with an esteemed populous. The film opens on a completely unrelated note in Latin America, wherein a heroin plant is infiltrated and destroyed by Bond (Connery) before a brief fistfight in a motel room that happens to encompass an interaction with a young woman. The item we spot above all else is how familiarised this sort of pre-credits sequence now is – a slice of action; a slice of ruthlessness, in the way Bond uses the woman to shield himself from a baton strike; a slice of introduction to the sort of anti-hero he is in the way he risks everything for a spot of action in the first place. But on the whole, it is a sequence designed to point out to people he is on the side of the moral when it becomes obvious the whole thing is essentially designed to point out Bond has just contributed to destroying a stock of hard drugs. This does not, of course, do anything to counterbalance how he makes smoking and having the odd alcoholic beverage look attractive.Landing in Miami shortly thereafter, Bond is on the trail of a certain Auric Goldfinger, played by Gert Fröbe. In another rare, if exclusive, instance we already have a bit of backlog regarding the man on account of the film's theme song which warns us of his abilities and the dangers that are synonymous with him. The film's chief joy is in its approach to the antagonism between Goldfinger and Bond, the hero and villain of the piece whose relationship with one another allows them to get close much earlier on than in Dr No and with the sort of acknowledged resentment that was lacking in From Russia With Love out of the complicated set up that needed Bond oblivious to whom his foes actually were. It's around here a prophecy of sorts is fulfilled when, upon recalling that the title song sung of ""pretty girls"" and the dangers of Goldfinger's web and how they should ""(don't) not go in"", a woman who betrayed him is killed off in one of the more iconic ways. Thus, we identify Goldfinger as a measured and sadistic threat up against whom our hero might have a tough time in handling. Eventually, of all things, the game of Golf is used as an ice breaker upon which these two may do battle; a tense sequence whereby two evenly matched egos whom ""hate to lose"" go up one another.Things lead on to Switzerland and the film toys with us in regards to whom its lead female will be. An interaction with someone whose sister it was whom was killed during the opening Florida based segment keeps things moving, but the true tryst and core relationship comes to revolve around the interaction with a certain Pussy Galore (Blackman), the head pilot of a highly trained squadron of circus planes. To an extent, the moment Galore announces her name is the moment the franchise slips into becoming exactly that: gone is the Tatiana Romanova from before and gone too is the somewhat less provocative Honey Ryder, replaced by something that isn't necessarily asking you to take it seriously in spite of the grounded nature of Bond's adventures up to this point. Central to the film is Galore's triumph over her own feelings towards men and into something else capable of embracing Bond, but it is a challenge to accept the idea that one's sexuality and one's morality can be both depicted as well as traversed simultaneously along these lines. Dozens of entries would attempt to follow in Goldfinger's lead, often they would fail. To an extent, it is fitting that the entry whereby they found that magic formula that encouraged people to keep coming back was entitled ""Goldfinger"", for the studio's magic monetary touch illuminated a franchise and, to an extent, would change event movie making forever.",Goldfinger

82,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Every piece of the franchise fits perfectly in place in 'Goldfinger',9,14 July 2013,"Few franchises truly get better with age, but the ""Bond"" series most certainly did in its first three films. The third film adventure based on Ian Fleming's now internationally beloved character, titled ""Goldfinger,"" introduced a number of franchise hallmarks (the Aston Martin chief among them) and holds up as an exciting, suspenseful and colorful spy film.Sean Connery returns to the role and as dashing as ever. The film's opening sequence takes place on a prior mission unrelated to the rest of the film, but showcases 007 sneaking about, setting off explosions, chasing a beautiful woman, taking off a wetsuit to reveal a white tuxedo and engaging in hand-to-hand combat. Does it get much better?A number of new elements keep Bond fresh yet again in ""Goldfinger."" Guy Hamilton, who replaces Terence Young (""Dr. No,"" ""From Russia with Love"") as director, demonstrates an exceptional understanding of what makes Bond tick; the script makes some unexpected deviations from the pattern to up the stakes; Shirley Bassey's gutsy theme song sets the bar for music in the series and Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) marks the first great ""Bond"" villain.""Goldfinger"" sees Bond tracking this title villain across the globe. In Miami, he learns quickly that Goldfinger isn't messing around, and after a debriefing from MI6 and a rundown of his gadget-loaded new set of wheels from Q (Desmond Llewelyn), he follows him from London to Switzerland and ultimately to Kentucky, where Goldfinger plans to lay siege to Ft. Knox. It's not all that simple, however, as we become slowly aware of what Goldfinger is really up to.Interestingly, Auric Goldfinger has no connection to SPECTRE despite the first two films involving the secret organization. Instead, Goldfinger is motivated by greed. He loves to win and he wants to do whatever it takes to get wealthier and wealthier. Bond also gets particularly close to Goldfinger, a trait that becomes increasingly common with the ""Bond"" films going forward. We get to know him much more as a character than either of the previous main villains.The girls of ""Goldfinger"" play a different role than in the past films. There's still that trademark '60s misogyny, but Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman), in spite of her character name, is her own woman: a pilot (and the oldest actress to play a ""Bond"" girl) who works for the enemy. Sure, she gives in to Bond's charms too easily, but that's the franchise for you. She's at least more than a piece of young, foreign meat, which Ursula Andress and Daniela Bianchi were.Between the souped-up Aston Martin and the first ever use of a laser on film, ""Goldfinger"" offered a lot of novelty, which shouldn't be too much of a surprise given the film's substantially larger budget. Still, it's the way these flashy elements are utilized effectively that makes ""Goldfinger"" a timeless action film.The secret weapon of this film is definitely Harold Sakata, Goldfinger's formidable personal assistant, Oddjob. A silent, short and stocky Polynesian (the character is supposed to be Korean) with a deadly bowler hat, he's one of the most original evil henchmen in film history.Firing on all cylinders would be an accurate way to describe ""Goldfinger."" Every element that you look for in a ""Bond"" film can be found and in top form in just this third movie in the franchise. It could well be that that's because ""Goldfinger"" set that standard and all the films have tried to live up ever since, but even so, it takes a great deal to craft a film that forges such iconic cinema.~Steven CThanks for reading!

84,Anonymous_Maxine,Excellent Bond film. Possibly even better than the great From Russia With Love.,9,28 July 2001,"Never mind the fact that the opening song of Goldfinger rivals that of The Man With The Golden Gun as the worst theme song of the entire series, Goldfinger has one of the best and most interesting stories of all of the Bond films. Goldfinger, the villain, by the way, proves late in the film the HE is the man with the golden gun, not some cheesy actor in a mediocre action film made ten years later.It starts off with a better than average opening sequence, despite the fact that in it, Bond uses a woman to deflect an attack and also has the unlikely ability to see reflections of what's going on behind him in a woman's eye. The main story of the film concerns a man named Goldfinger who wants to contaminate the United States' gold supply at Fort Knox to create economic chaos in the west and greatly increase the value of his own substantial gold supplies at the same time. It seems that because gold is relatively easy to melt down and remold, it is very easy to smuggle, and it is also the basis of the value of the dollar and pound. More than in either of the preceding two Bond films, we get what has come to be the traditional introduction by Q of all of Bond's new gadgets, most notably his heavily armed and beautiful new car, the Aston Martin DB-5. Also, under new direction, Bond seems to be decidedly clumsier than usual. He messes up pretty good near the beginning of the film, and then later he messes up again because he does not know entirely what is going on. There was also a badly botched gunfight during the film that involved that car. Someone shoots at James with a machine gun in the car, and even though the windshield is covered all the way across with bullet holes, none of them seemed to have hit him. I can understand someone being a bad aim, but those bullets would have had to turn in mid-flight in order to miss him.Goldfinger calls his plan to detonate an atomic device inside Fort Knox, thereby rendering all of the gold radioactive for almost 60 years, Operation Grand Slam. The movie really starts to get good once this plan starts to get underway, with the exception of the ridiculous way that thousands of people dropped to the ground the second the planes flew overhead, spraying Goldfinger's poisonous gas. You'd think that it would at least take a few seconds for the gas to disperse through the air and get to the ground and into the peoples' lungs before they started dropping like flies. It is a particularly eyebrow-raising moment when Goldfinger talks about all of the great human accomplishments - climbing Everest, reaching the bottom of the ocean, sending rockets to the moon (not manned, of course. This IS only 1964, after all)  he talks about all of these achievements `in every area except crime!' Evidently, it is his goal to make his defacing of Fort Knox the major accomplishment in crime. Despite the obvious obsoleteness of most of the technology seen in the entire film, there is some true tension created by the skillfully paced climax, which is one of the main things that places Goldfinger high above most of the other Bond films.
(spoilers) Another thing that was really impressive was the effectiveness of the laser beam that Goldfinger employed to kill Bond (even though he decided not to kill him), while delivering some of the most famous dialogue in film history  `Do you expect me to talk?' `No, I expect you to die!' This was especially noteworthy because it was the first laser beam ever used in a film. And speaking of which, the Austin Powers influence can hardly be ignored in this early Bond film. First of all, the above dialogue was hilariously borrowed by Dr. Evil, but it is the names of two of the more prevalent characters that is the most memorable thing in this film. Just as the name of Dr. Evil's cycloptic henchman, #2, was more than likely inspired by the goofy character #3 in From Russia With Love, the names of two of his other sidekicks were obviously taken from Goldfinger. Obviously, any Bond film with a Bond girl named Pussy Galore is sure to be skewered by Mike Myers' unique sense of humor, and sure enough, we get a character in Austin Powers named Alotta. Alotta Fagina. Another character whose named was parodied in exactly the same way was Dr. Evil's goofy sidekick Random Task, whose name is obviously a parody of Goldfinger's goofy sidekick, Odd Job. And how could Myers possibly avoid making fun of that idiotic hat trick?There are many things that make Goldfinger a better than average Bond film, despite the fact that it obviously has many weaknesses. Sean Connery was just as great as he ever was before or since as the endlessly charming James Bond, even though this film, like every single other Bond film, was filled to capacity with dozens of idiotic one-liners that serve only to lower the standard of the film series as a whole. But in that sense, you can't really hold the one-liners against this film. On the contrary, maybe it should count in the film's favor that it was able to overcome the stupidity of the one-liners and still deliver an exciting and engaging action film. Now if only Pierce Brosnan would star in a Bond film that's worth watching",Goldfinger

""Goldfinger"" is to be found somewhere in between, because it is still an interesting action classic but only enjoyable for sentimental reasons, because the action is hilariously clumsy and painfully outdated for nowadays standards. But it still is a cute spy classic. If you wanna watch one of the older Bond movies THIS is the one to see. The best of the golden oldies.The Bond theme song by Shirley Bassey has NOT been outdated however. That song is still THE greatest Bond song EVER! What a power! We have to thank composer John Barry for that! Bond Music from the sixties has got an ambient sound to it that makes current recordings sound bland. Shirley Bassey's themesong sounds so sparkling, sharp and has got such a gloriously cathedral sound. If only for the soundtrack I would wanna watch this movie again and again...",Goldfinger
86,GOWBTW,The first Bond film I can remember!,10,8 August 2006,"Fans of James Bond, hear me! ""Goldfinger"" is a classic and precious film gem of all times. Sean Connery did a terrific job playing the suave spy from jolly old England. Even though he's a reckless character, he does seem to get the job done anyways. Yes, he's quite a charmer, but don't let the looks fool you. He's got a steady hand, a sharp wit, and his martinis are ""shaken, not stirred"". Well enough of all that, this cat here is to stop a gold hungry madman named Auric Goldfinger(Gert Frobe). He thinks he has the Midas touch, but his plans will indeed turn into lead instead. He catches James Bond during the raid after he has Oddjob use his deadly derby on Tilly Masterson(Tania Mallet) earlier in the film, he paints Jill Masterson(Shirley Easton) GOLD! The Aston Martin Bond drives is cool, I liked the part where he took out the Mustang, and the injector seat is top notch. My favorite scene is where Oddjob kills the crime leader and sends him into the scrap yard where he brings in the Lincoln, and comes out driving the Ford Ranchero with the cubed Lincoln in the back. It was great when Bond flash-fry Oddjob, he maybe tough, but he wasn't indestructible. For Miss Pussy Galore(Honor Blackman), she one tough cookie, she had a heart of a lion, and that's scary for me to tame. This movie is great, it was full of surprises and I enjoyed every minute of it. Check out all the Bond films and get the feeling! 5 stars.",Goldfinger

Our villain is an insidious gambler who also happens to be a jeweler, a metallurgist, and a cad. He employs ""Odd Job,"" a Korean baddie who looks like the 1960's version of wrestling's Fuji (or was that Mount Fuji?).This is a great chapter in the Bond world, but it is far from ""the best,"" in my opinion. That honor is bestowed on Moore's ""Octopussy."" Connery swaggers a bit too much in this film, for my tastes. It is as if he is believing his own press, and has lost his style as a result. Frankly, although I know Connery leaves the franchise eventually, I think he should have left prior to this installment.It's fun, but it's not all that it's made out to be.Goldfinger is a classic in the venue of Bond films, and if you have never seen it, I recommend it, even though it is not among my personal favorites.It rates a 7.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",Goldfinger
88,elshikh4,"Real Gold, or Gold Plated ?!",2,27 May 2021,"This is a piece from the 1960s that says a lot about it. This is where Bond looked really goofy, and did nothing at all. And this is so polished yet foolish after all!Initially, (Dr. No - 1962) installed the Bond Windows; as a formula of action / spy / sci-fi variety show, with a host that's a mix of ruthless killer and frantic womanizer. Yes, (From Russia with Love - 1963) tried to install the somehow respectable spy version of Bond. However, suddenly and decisively, the first version overcame and ruled in (Goldfinger - 1964), and that Windows ran automatically ever since!So what's good in here? Let me tell you: Gert Frobe as (Auric Goldfinger), he was so believable as a Bond villain. The Jazzy orchestra of John Barry. Ted Moore's smooth cinematography. And Sean Connery' charisma, and full suits.Then the clever details: Oddjob's killer hat, the car's flying seat, the killer laser beam, and ""No, Mr. Bond. I expect you to DIE!"".On the other hand: The plot is laughable. The characters are uninteresting caricature. The conflict is idiot; Goldfinger got chances to kill Bond many times, though strangely he didn't! I hated the wrong info about the so-called skin suffocation; this is sci-fi at its worst. I saw the camera's shadow so visible when Connery woke up to find the golden corpse (How shameful!). The image turns into funny fast-motion while the fistfight of Bond and Oddjob. And the climax wasn't that hot, at least like its numerous likes later in the series.Connery won the Golden Laurel for the best Action Performance in a 1964's movie?! Well, all what he did here was nothing but getting Goldfinger's girl on his side. This round, he's more of a Mickey Mouse; a character which's called hero for no convincing reasons!Over and above, the wild sexual nature; in terms of the women outfits, or the lack of them thereof, the double entendre lines, or names! From a pretty lenient standpoint, this is the 1960's vulgarity which rebelled against the decency of the previous decades. But from my taste's standpoint, this is just rude, and such a historical insult towards women as sex objects only. So when Connery says: ""I must be dreaming!"" you have to understand that these mean values are the dream that was presented to the people back then as entertainment, or the entertainment!In conclusion, it's not a movie about spying. Not an action I suppose. It's a memory from the 1960s about the 1960s. While the retreat of the traditional westerns, the musicals, and the invasion of the new wave, and the existential movies, (Goldfinger) was here to stay and own the commercial throne, being as absurd and ribald as it is. Simply this is the kind of imagination and fluff that were intensively manufactured during the cold war-era; to make the viewers forget their worries, and become more self-indulgent, more sex & vulgarity-crazed.So after 1964 and during the whole 1960s, the Bond's offspring would lead all over the world (OSS 117, Flint, Agent 077, Matt Helm, Kommissar X, A Man Called Dagger, Agente Gordon, etcetera etcetera..) with the girlie versions, the TV shows, the parodies, and let's not forget the original Bond as well. Hence, the success of (Goldfinger) represents the sovereignty of its formulaic hero, structure and elements.True that (Goldfinger) is gold plated for me, but it works as an example of the expensive, silly and successful cartoon that was made at the moment, and as a history lesson about the degradation of the cinematic respect for reason and moral code, plus the degradation of the audience taste as well; ok, here's where its real gold shines!",Goldfinger
89,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,3 November 2020,"Yeah... I'm solidly in the ""From Russia With Love is the greatest Bond Movie"" camp. And if there was ever a point of contest in the Bond franchise, it's not really who the best Bond was (Roger or Sean) it's which is the best Bond film, From Russia with Love or Goldfinger.Goldfinger isn't the best... It's the SECOND BEST. What it is is the most unique. And it's the most fun.Bond sort of Pooches it in this one and still manages to Forrest Gump his way to victory, and you haven't seen that in any 007 movie since. This is the movie about a mission that SHOULD have been in the lose category. At the time of this release, by the end of the movie Bond's record should have been 2 and 1... only he still manages to claim victory.And he kind of does it through no fault of his own. Sure, the final battle he comes out on top, but all the events that come before it go horribly wrong, he should have died, Goldfinger should have won, and the only reason he didn't was because of the cunning of other people who are NOT James Bond.I know, it sounds like I'm ripping into it, but really, seriously, I'm not. All of that is what makes it such a loveable and memorable and unique Bond film, one like you have never seen before and probably never will again.The only other one that comes remotely close to it is Skyfall, and even then Bond isn't as bumbling as he is in Goldfinger... and of course it's Sean Connery, so he's still dapper, still suave as he sort of stumbles to victory.It is all probably why this is so hotly contested as the Best 007 film among die hard 007 fans, the pure uniqueness of this particular outing, the fact that you will never see Bond in such a light again. The fact that ONLY Connery can pull off a suave and confident almost failure in a way that makes you think he's anything BUT a failure despite nothing going his way.And then, of course, it is absolutely fun. It is absolutely entertaining. And those are two reasons why people watch movies.",Goldfinger
90,freemantle_uk,Classic Bond Action,10,17 June 2009,"Goldfinger is the gold standard of Bond films, one of the best ever made. Here it has the right mix of everything with the Bond series, serious and humour, realism and fantasy, great villains, action and women.After a successful mission in Central America, James Bond (Sean Connery) is having a break in Miami Beach. M sends the CIA's Felix Leiter (Cec Linder) to ask him to look at Auric Goldfinger (Gert Fröbe), a wealth man and gold smuggler. In Miami Bond humiliates Goldfinger and ends up sleeping with his girlfriend, the beautiful Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton). Goldfinger shows his brutal side by murdering Jill, as a message to Bond. Bond convinces M that he can carry on for the mission and follows Goldfinger to Switzerland. He ends up getting captured by Goldfinger's forces and sent to America with Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman). Whilst in the States Bond gets to know what Goldfinger's plan, Operation Grandslam and had to stop him from completing them.Sean Connery as Bond is possibly the most famous and the best (though Daniel Craig is catching up to him). Here Goldfinger is the model Bond film with some of the best action scenes, humour, the best Bond girls and a decent plot with is both far-fetch and serious at the same time. Goldfinger has some of the most famous scenes in Bond's history, such as Shirley Eaton painted gold and Bond nearly getting cut in half by a laser. Goldfinger himself is a great villain and wonderfully played by Gert Fröbe. Pussy Galore is great at lighten up the mood of film. Oddjob is also a fantastic hench-man and someone you wouldn't want to mess with. It combines elements of evil schemes, crime and geo-politics. Guy Hamilton himself is a fine director, also making Live and Let Die and the Battle of Britain. Goldfinger also has one of the most famous songs for a Bond film, a big power ballet by Shirley Bassey which even gets parodied in the excellent Simpsons episode, You Only Move Twice.This is a must see for all Bond fans and Sean Connery fans. A classic action film from the 60s.",Goldfinger

92,ebiros2,The defining James Bond movie,8,22 October 2005,"In my opinion, this is the movie that defined James Bond. Dr. No and From Russia with Love was preparation for getting to this movie. The outrageous Aston Martin DB5 that comes with tire thrasher, machine gun, bullet proof shield and ejection seat was something never seen in a movie. The mood was more pure British than the more recent incarnations of Bond movies, and it has subtle yet classy with rye sense of humor. From this point on audiences really expected to see the unexpected in a Bond movie. Everything was super sized, and this became the tone for all future Bond movies.This is the movie that comes only once in ten years that defines the genre like Star Wars, Enter the Dragon (which was loosely based on this movie). To proof, many look alike movies followed, most recent and most unlikely being Mike Myer's ""Goldmember"" which in my opinion captures more James Bond essence than the recent Bond movies like ""Die another day"".Still ""Nobody does it better"" than the original Goldfinger.",Goldfinger
93,ackstasis,"""Shocking! Positively shocking!""",7,20 October 2007,"After yesterday's viewing of 'From Russia in Love,' it seemed somewhat masochistic to deny myself the next James Bond adventure, and so tonight saw me watching 'Goldfinger (1964)' for the first time. Though it is often touted as the finest the franchise has to offer, I can't say that I agree with this; as far as this Bond-illiterate guy could deduce, its two predecessors were superior! Nonetheless, Guy Hamilton's adaptation of Ian Fleming's seventh Bond novel, published in 1959, was a phenomenal box-office hit and established the longevity of the series. It has everything that fans have come to expect from James Bond: intelligent, independent female characters (often with improbable and risqué titles); Q's elaborate and inventive gadgetry; an evil and uncompromising villain; a fiendish and daring plot of destruction. Sean Connery returned for his third of six ""official"" appearances as the legendary MI6 agent, once again up to his old tricks of saving the world, beating the bad-guy and getting the women.In this adventure, the villain does not arise from the terrorist organisation SPECTRE, but rather is in the game for his own personal wealth. Auric Goldfinger (played by Gert Fröbe; voiced by Michael Collins) is a smuggler of gold bullion, illegally trafficking the bars out of Britain and into Switzerland where he can get a better price. His devilish scheme differs slightly from that in the novel, and it really is an ingenious plan. By detonating a nuclear weapon at the U.S. Bullion Depository at Fort Knox, Kentucky, Goldfinger hopes to contaminate the gold store for the next 58 years, crippling America's economy and causing the value of his own personal stocks to increase tenfold. Goldfinger's memorable henchmen is the silent Oddjob (Harold Sakata), whose strength is such that he can kill a person merely by throwing his hat at them. Both villains, it needn't be said, reach, at the hands of our hero, spectacular ends that certainly do justice to their lively personalities.Though, overall, I must say that I didn't find 'Goldfinger' quite as engaging as 'Dr. No' or 'From Russia with Love,' it does have several moments that are simply brilliant. Goldfinger's laser demonstration to Bond, who can only watch as the searing beam progresses ever-so-slowly towards his crotch, is a minor masterpiece of nail-biting suspense. The climax at Fort Knox (a remarkable interior set produced exclusively for the film) is absolutely gripping, and the classic cliché of the hero frantically deciding which bomb wire to cut is turned onto his head when Felix Leiter's associate calmly leans over and hits an 'off' switch with 007 seconds remaining. Curiously, many of the Bond women in 'Goldfinger' appear quite expendable: one (Shirley Eaton) is memorably covered entirely in gold paint and left to suffocate, another (Tania Mallet) is killed by Oddjob's deadly head-wear, and another, in the film's pre-credit sequence, betrays Bond and is forcibly spun around to be clunked on the head by her own ally. Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman) is probably the series' most independent Bond girl to date, always in control of the situation and her own actions until, that is, the charms of our hero firmly make their mark.",Goldfinger
94,dee.reid,My first time commenting on a James Bond picture...,10,10 April 2009,"""Goldfinger"" is not just one of the best James Bond movies (it is arguably the best, and personally I think it's the second best), but it's one of the best action/adventure movies ever made. (Just as an aside, 1995's ""GoldenEye"" is probably my favorite James Bond film, and Pierce Brosnan is my personal favorite James Bond - perhaps because it was made during my lifetime; I was born in 1985.) Expertly directed by Guy Hamilton, ""Goldfinger"" was the third James Bond feature and it pretty much set the standard for all the James Bond features that followed and featured many of the most groundbreaking and exciting action sequences and stunt-work and some of the wittiest quips, and these standards were all pretty hard standards to live up to. Ian Fleming's Agent 007 James Bond (Sean Connery) is out this time to foil the nefarious plot of Auric Goldinger (Gert Frobe), a gold magnate out to contaminate the U.S. gold reserve at Fort Knox. ""Goldfinger"" contains many of the series greatest and most memorable action sequences (including the famous laser scene and the show-stopping climax on-board an airborne jet) and the haunting shot of Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton) spread out nude on a bed, covered in gold body paint. And then there's Goldfinger's mysterious and deadly chief henchman/manservant/assassin Oddjob (Harold Sakata), one of the most memorable movie villains with a derby that may or may not in some way have inspired ""Master of the Flying Guillotine"" (1975). And lastly, there's Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman). Shirley Massey also does a great job on the classic soundtrack with the title song. Whoever thought that ""Goldfinger"" would be a great movie was right. Every scene crackles with action and life, and there's not ever a single wasted shot. Connery is great, in his best performance as James Bond, and he's still at his best as the playboy super-spy who knows how to sex up the ladies.

As always agent 007 is equal to any challenge; the only time he loses his cool is while strapped to a table with a laser beam threatening his manhood. He comes armed, of course, with all the latest gadgetry, but logic and credibility were never among his arsenal; the film is aimed squarely at adolescent boys eager for identification, with more glitz and glamour than legitimate espionage, and showing a curious note of old-fashioned morality (worse than being merely evil, Goldfinger cheats at golf and cards).

Where Dr. No and From Russia With Love were deathly serious, concentrating heavily on suspense, Goldfinger is far less afraid to kick back and have a little fun when the opportunity arises. There's definitely a healthy dose of the 1960s at play here, from the fashions on display to the attitudes of those wearing them, but in almost every single instance that results in a stronger, more vibrant cast. Despite their appallingly silly names, Oddjob, Pussy Galore and even Goldfinger himself are thoroughly deep, interesting, remarkable characters with a lot going on beneath the surface. The exploration of each villain's unique nooks and crannies, paired with an intensely curvy, unpredictable plot and the unmistakable presence of Bond himself, provides more fuel than any film could reasonably require. Quick in wit and in pace, it covers a lot of ground with admirable efficiency, leaves us with two fistfuls of memorable moments, and raises the stakes to staggering heights.

In addition to attending to Goldfinger there's also the threat of fellow villains Odd Job and Pussy Galore in this magnificent escapist piece featuring the Bond for all seasons, Connery.I've not seen them all but Goldfinger remains the gold standard for the franchise to me, where the boilerplate settled and followed with some Bonds better than others but none the likes of Sean Connery.",Goldfinger
100,Fluke_Skywalker,Has the midas touch,7,25 August 2015,"Often described as the quintessential Bond film. It certainly created the template that was followed (slavishly at times) for decades. But here it still manages to feel fresh; girls, gadgets, specialized henchman, frickin' lasers. And unlike many Bond films, particularly from the Moore era on, it doesn't overstay its welcome, coming in at a jaunty 110 minutes. Connery, of course, is Bond. There's no affectation. One gets the sense that he he's not acting, but that the camera is merely following him around in his daily life.For anyone reared on modern action movies your patience may be tested, as there's little here that resembles action in the contemporary sense, and if you want dark and brooding, go elsewhere. There's no doubt or relativism here. I found these aspects rather refreshing, but others may find it frustrating. Also keep in mind that this movie is 51(!) years old, and political correctness was merely a dark storm on the horizon. With that said, I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a place to start their Bond experience.

In addition, the color cinematography captures some wonderful images, as Bond drives a revved up sports car through spectacular scenery in Europe, and a big budget allows some imaginative indoor sets and props, including a red-hot laser beam and the imposing interior of Fort Knox.Sound effects add a subtle layer of credibility, with the clicking, ticking, buzzing, beeping, and all those echoes.

Multiple times the villainous Goldfinger has the chance to kill Bond, but finds reasons not to do so. But it's all tongue-in-cheek anyway.

There's not that much to say that hasn't already been said. Kudos to many of the supporting cast, including Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore. (Just wanted an excuse to type that!) Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny was quite pretty, as was Shirley Eaton and Tania Mallet as the Masterson sisters. Gert Frobe as Goldfinger was sufficiently amorally evil. The Oddjob character was a bit jarring and unnecessary, and a portent of the ruination to come in the later films.",Goldfinger

105,r96sk,"Overall, I expected better",7,16 March 2020,"My least favourite of the opening three films. I found 'Goldfinger' rather mundane.It's still solid, it has the charm that the Bond series brings and shows off some of the new gadgets. However, this entry never gets out of second gear. It felt like we were following James Bond on holiday in most parts.The cast, Sean Connery aside, won't be remembered by me, just like those from 'Dr. No' - that is with the exception of the names of course, Pussy Galore is quite unforgettable!Even the filming locations, which were super in the preceding two films, are only above average here. Overall, I expected better.",Goldfinger
106,barnabyrudge,Rated by many as the best of the Bond films. I'd say its two predecessors are better - but this one is still enormously entertaining.,9,7 June 2006,"Goldfinger is rated by many as the best of the Bond movies. For example, it is the only 007 film to feature in Steven Jay Schneider's wonderful film buff's handbook ""1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die"". Even Halliwell calls it: ""probably the liveliest and most amusing of the Bond spy spoofs"", which is great praise indeed from such a hard-to-please critic. In my opinion, it is certainly ONE of the best, but not actually THE best - I would still bestow that honour upon either Dr. No or From Russia With Love. Ironically, Goldfinger also marks the first signs that the series was developing its reliance on technological gadgets, an aspect of the films that the critics would later cite as a weakness rather than a strength. However, in Goldfinger the gadgetry is all very new and very fresh and seems to add to the film's perennial appeal.James Bond (Sean Connery) - vacationing in Florida following a recent mission - gets the better of a card cheat named Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe). However, Goldfinger has the last laugh when he suffocates one of Bond's lady friends by painting her entire body with gold paint. Soon after Bond once more crosses paths with Goldfinger, this time having a chance encounter with him at a golf course (an encounter in which, yet again, Bond exposes his adversary as a cheat). But even then their rivalry is not over - for later still, Bond discovers that Goldfinger is an incredibly rich and powerful international smuggler who has amassed a fortune in gold as a result of his criminal activity. Bond uncovers Goldfinger's plan to detonate an atomic bomb inside Fort Knox, thereby contaminating the US gold reserves and increasing the value of his own stocks. In a race against time, 007 must prevent this audacious scheme, but he must first find a way to deal with Goldfinger's ruthless henchman Oddjob (Harold Sakata) - an oriental goliath who murders his victims by striking them down with a metal-rimmed bowler hat. And then there's the small matter of Goldfinger's female pilot, a woman who is more than a match for Bond in more ways than one - Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman).Goldfinger is lightning-paced entertainment, featuring a whole host of classic scenes. Who can forget Shirley Eaton's corpse coated in gold? Or Bond using that infamous ejector seat in his Aston Martin DB5? And then there's 007 and Pussy Galore's fight in the hay. not to mention the unforgettable scene where Bond is almost castrated with a giant laser gun whilst strapped onto a block of gold. Connery is delightful in his role, and seems to give the best performance of his six Bond entries (prior to this he was still growing in the role, after this he made it publicly open that he was beginning to tire of it). Gert Frobe makes a splendid villain, and Blackman is one of the most interesting of the many Bond girls. Also, Sakata deserves a mention for his wordless yet thoroughly menacing performance as the terrifying Oddjob. The theme tune from Shirley Bassey is memorable, and the sets (including an impressive Fort Knox interior) are very lavish indeed. Grand entertainment.",Goldfinger
107,Kdosda_Hegen,James the rapist.,3,12 December 2020,"This film was very bad. While it has a few good action moments, most are very generic and simple action scenes even for it's time.

108,JoeKarlosi,Goldfinger (1964) ****,10,27 November 2012,"I know it's not very unique to single out GOLDFINGER as ""the one"" that really solidified Sean Connery as the #1 actor for the role, and as ""the one that set the template for future Bond films to come"". It is a very common opinion and I'm afraid I agree completely and can't offer much difference from what many fans are used to hearing. This was the third James Bond movie, and Sean Connery really owned the part by this time. He is the perfect 007, ranging from his suave good looks to his biting witticisms and no- nonsense business when the need arises. In this installment he runs afoul of one Auric Goldfinger (played by Gert Frobe), a very tough mastermind whose latest endeavor is a brilliant plan to break into Fort Knox. Bond runs into his tough female assistant named Pussy Galore (""I must be dreaming,"" 007 bemuses when she introduces herself to him), played by Avengers star Honor Blackman. It's refreshing even this early on in the series to have Bond hooked up with a Bond Girl who is as hard-edged as he can be.GOLDFINGER also set the standard for super-henchmen. Here we have former Asian wrestler Harold Sakata playing a brutish killer called ""Oddjob"", who can decapitate his victims by flinging his steel-rimmed hat at their necks. Desmond Llewellyn really comes into his own as ""Q"", who furnishes Bond with more and more fantastic gadgets as the stories progressed; for this occasion he introduces the Aston Martin DB5, a classic supercar adorned with all sorts of hidden gimmicks and life-prolonging assets. After GOLDFINGER, the feel of the James Bond films would often take on more out of this world comic book elements for some time. The film itself is tightly paced and well directed by Guy Hamilton. The lead song as sung by Shirley Bassey is a good one, too. If anyone out there has never seen a James Bond movie, or wants to try out their first Sean Connery one, here is a strong point at which to begin. **** out of ****",Goldfinger
109,drystyx,"lots of fun, reminiscent of times and still fresh today",9,7 March 2008,"This Bond flick is just as fresh and slick today as it was when released. Movies were directed much better in those days. The viewer was allowed to follow the action instead of be in some goofy video arcade game. This movie has James Bond working undercover to find out more about mogul Goldfinger. He never really seems to be under cover, though. In fact, he sticks out as the spy he is. It is no spoiler to say he is captured and faces harrowing situations. He meets women, gangsters, and other spies. He is almost always on his own in this movie, isolated from his fellow agents. He never loses his cool. A true James Bond. Goldfinger eventually tries to knock off Fort Knox. Even at the time, it was considered folly, and people tell Goldfinger this, but he has a master plan, albeit a comic book sort of plan, but he is a mad man, as noted by Bond. He also has the help of an equally insane and determined henchman, Odd Job. The action is good, and there is plenty of adventure. I lived in Louisville at the time, but I was a toddler. I vaguely recall the gas station being somewhere close (I lived in a central area, off Crittenden Drive, the easiest road to find in Louisville, in a trailer park by a drive in.) It has all disappeared. The trailer court and drive in are now Kentucky Kingdom. All of Louisville is rebuilt. There is probably not a square block area that even remotely looks the same. The movie gives a good feel for the times, hard to imagine for people who live in this super fast information age. Most of the scenes were not in Louisville, however. Aside from the gas station scene, none of it looks familiar. But this movie is slick and fun. I can't imagine anyone not liking it.",Goldfinger
110,slokes,Flawed Film Delivers Foolproof Formula,7,7 August 2010,"As a spy story, it's a mess, but a sense of humor will help people forgive a lot. ""Goldfinger"" succeeds more as action comedy than pure suspense.James Bond (Sean Connery) is relaxing in Miami Beach when he encounters a mysterious card cheat named Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe). Bond figures out Goldfinger's game and turns the tables on him, making off with Goldfinger's gorgeous accomplice Jill (Shirley Eaton). But you don't mess with the ""man with the Midas touch"" and get away so easily.Ask either a Bond-movie lover or someone with no interest in the series what the best 007 film ever was, chances are good you'll get the same answer: This one. One may call it by its title, and the other something like ""The one where Bond's going to get it in the crotch with the laser"", but ""Goldfinger"" is widely seen as the gold standard.So I admit my non-complete embrace of ""Goldfinger"" with some regret. It's a fine entertainment, but for me the least of the first four Bond films; not as shocking as ""Dr. No"", not as finely crafted as ""From Russia With Love"", and not as engaging or exciting as ""Thunderball"".But ""Goldfinger"" was the film that delivered the Bond formula in its purest form. An opening setpiece scene to get the blood going, a wildly dramatic theme song, an outrageous plot, a memorable ""sacrificial lamb"", and most importantly, two of the best villains of the series, Goldfinger himself and his mute-but-merry cinderblock of an assistant, Oddjob (Harold Sakata), whose death-dealing bowler hat is an icon in itself.Most of all, it dares to be funny, not just after the action is over but while it is still going on. Our first image of Bond is of him in scuba gear with a seabird on his head. When first told the lead villain's name, Bond snorts: ""Sounds like a French nail varnish"". Asked by a naked woman why he wears a gun, Bond shrugs: ""I have a slight inferiority complex.""Director Guy Hamilton seems to prefer a less strait-laced Bond then predecessor Terence Young did, sacrificing believability for effect. His panache helps one overlook some major logic holes. When Bond is allowed to wander around Goldfinger's estate, wooing the apparently uninterested Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman), the repartee and the scenery makes the pure idiocy of Bond's situation easier to overlook. A scene where Goldfinger traps and slaughters a group of would-be allies gets by because it doesn't linger long enough for a viewer to ask why.Peter Hunt's editing is justly praised for the way it keeps the story moving. This is so especially at the end, where he introduces the concept of the Bond countdown clock, the only clock that seems to gain seconds back when the camera moves away from it. Ken Adam's sets, especially Fort Knox, are good-enough excuses for abusing the still-frame button. Ted Moore's visuals are rich and stylish, nicely straddling the artificiality of Cinemascope-style productions with the rawer tones of films just over the horizon.Connery is at times lost in the background of his own film, the price of a hyperactive script. He plays Bond way lighter than he did in ""Dr. No"", a choice that not only makes sense for the script but for the series. Bond couldn't have been as lasting or penetrating a persona without his tongue firmly in cheek.This became the nub of the Bond formula: 1. Plant tongue in cheek. 2. Get away with murder. ""Goldfinger"" proved it could be done, and Bond films have been proving it can still be done ever since.",Goldfinger
111,I_Ailurophile,"""Classic"" doesn't mean ""good""",2,18 December 2020,"Call me a cynic: I view 'Goldfinger' as being a memorable entry into the James Bond franchise because it's so bad.Oddjob is a great henchman. Goldfinger's Operation Grand Slam is clever. Those famous two lines are immortalized forever: ""Do you expect me to talk?"" ""No, I expect you to die!""Unfortunately, the rest of the movie can't live up to those three highlights.Bond's carelessness gets two women needlessly killed.The film downplays into oblivion that Miss Galore and her pilots are lesbians as she falls prey to the inescapable manly charms of Mr. Bond. Horribly, this erasure is an improvement on the even more appalling sexism and homophobia Ian Fleming wrote into his book.And about Goldfinger's plot: It would have been better suited to another movie. As has been pointed out, including in other reviews on this very site, the success of this film led producers to push the Bond franchise in a distinct direction. Predecessors 'Dr. No' and 'From Russia with love' aren't perfect, but they are very understated compared to later entries in the series: relatively little sexism, no super flashy gadgets, minimized action, and rather serious-minded overall. After audiences lapped up all the worst traits of James Bond that were glorified in 'Goldfinger,' subsequent films took a turn for the worse. Bond #3 represents the pivot from ""spy thriller"" to ""spy flick,"" and Grand Slam is a plan that would have been more cinematically appropriate for an earlier generation of thriller.Ironically, after 007 became squarely an action/adventure series--for all the trash, some other later entries were able to embrace what they were without any hangups: not necessarily perfect, yet in the least, damn fine for what they are.I'm torn on the casting. Sean Connery was a good actor. But for his tenure as James Bond, his skill as a performer meant embodying the worst traits of a rake, coming across as suave and macho to the point of obnoxious pretentiousness. In the first two films he was able to play the role relatively seriously; in subsequent movies, those undesirable traits were reconfigured to include boyish playfulness and silliness (""Boys will be boys,"" dontcha know), making his behavior no less gross yet even more annoying. And, once more, 'Goldfinger' represents the turn.And Bond's superiors know all about his churlish behavior, and only enable him.It's not all bad. But the bad far outweighs the good, to the point that my memories of the movie are generally overwhelmed by what I dislike. Not entirely true of the Bond franchise as a whole, but definitely true of 'Goldfinger.'",Goldfinger
112,Spondonman,24 carat Bond...even Pussy went down Well,8,26 November 2012,"Almost sublime - this James Bond film had it all, from adventure to romance to thrills. It starts with a shocking electrocution and then into the classic saucy gold credits before the scene is set with Goldfinger himself.Bond, played by dashing Sean Connery for the third time, has to find out what unpleasant gold-smuggling chap named Auric Goldfinger is up to and put a stop to it. He tracks him down first to Geneva then Kentucky in a sparkling sequence of adventures, occasionally involving bumping into Goldfinger's memorable Korean hatchet-man Oddjob with the odd hat. Favourite bits from so many: short-lived girlfriend Shirley Eaton going for gold; polished Bond being dismissive of the brandy at the Bank Of England much to M's pleb puzzlement; the debut of the special Aston Martin and Q's workshop; the narky golf match between Bond and Goldfinger; Bond's close but rather unnecessary laser shave at Goldfinger's HQ; his various encounters with feisty Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman); the gangster with the pressing engagement; and Shirley Bassey's title song was by miles the best Bond song ever.The whole film is still a joy, maybe improbable and even ludicrous at times yet I watched it rapt all these years later. It portrays back to us a simpler world though we didn't know it at the time, a world I can sometimes relate to better than the beautiful perfect world we have now. You don't need cgi cartoonery, strong sex, extreme violence, so-called realism – or even a sensible story – if you've got the right mix of escapism and personality put together by people who enjoy what they're doing instead of only being in the middle of a franchise.",Goldfinger

Gert Fröbe is one of the all time best Bond villains with an incredible performance and Harold Sakata and Honor Blackman are both great.Guy Hamilton's direction is fantastic, it's extremely well filmed and well paced. The music by John Barry and the song by Shirley Bassey are both perfect with the song itself being one of the best Bond songs ever.",Goldfinger
114,davidmvining,Connery's best outing as Bond,10,17 January 2020,"Where From Russia with Love found its groove late in the running, Goldfinger fires on all cylinders from the opening. Sean Connery is just as suave and cool as before, but the movie is more assured from the outset, confidently placing Bond in situations and against an antagonist who's interesting, intelligent, and threatening from the start. This is the first Bond movie that's a complete package from beginning to end.One of the fun things about Goldfinger that didn't happen in the first two Bond adventures is that there's an actual mystery. British and American intelligence know that Auric Goldfinger is up to something with gold, but they don't know what. They just know that he's a major gold trader, completely legal, and that he has made some curious moves that they think may be part of something larger and more nefarious. So, they send in Bond to investigate. Bond's early estimation of Goldfinger is not kind. Our introduction to the antagonist is him taking advantage of a fellow vacationer in Miami by cheating his way at winning at cards. It's a petty thing implying a petty and small man. Bond feels confident at having embarrassed Goldfinger, but the large gold bug is not to be trifled with and makes his viciousness clear by killing the girl who was helping him cheat and fell into Bond's arms.Then the pursuit actually begins. Bond starts by thinking Goldfinger will be an easy target, but Goldfinger needs to be taken seriously, and that's what Bond does as he follows the antagonist to Switzerland. It's here that Bond begins to pick up the pieces of the plan, mostly in the form of a codename, Operation Grand Slam. When Bond gets captured, Goldfinger has had enough of the British spies antics and settles on killing him, but Bond has to use his wits and the single piece of information he has in order to convince Goldfinger to let him live. This scene with the laser is tense and establishes a tool that will come in later as well. This movie's really well constructed.And that's one of the big reasons this movie works so well. Things get established early and paid off, like the laser. Through it all is Bond being the cynical who uses everyone around him, especially women, to get what he needs. His only discernable feeling is bemusement as he watches his efforts pay off. It's pure fantasy fulfilment.When the action moves to Kentucky and Fort Knox is when we finally learn what Goldfinger's plan actually is, and it's not what we would expect. We're given about twenty minutes where we can just assume that Goldfinger wants to steal a bunch of gold, but when Bond outlines the reality of moving that gold out of the fort we realize that there has to be more. Goldfinger's actual plan moves the effort from almost petty theft not really worthy of Bond's attention to diabolical and something we would expect Bond to work on.The addition of other secondary characters that are as interesting as they are fun adds to the entertainment value as a whole. Odd Job, Goldfinger's silent Korean manservant with a deadly hat, is an imposing physical antagonist that compliments the doughy, verbose Goldfinger. Pussy Galore, the final of three Bond girls, is witty and an appropriate match for Bond. The action is well done (though never quite matching the train fight in From Russia with Love) and the movie looks really good. The sets are big and elaborate (my favorite being Goldfinger's office in Kentucky).It's the complete package of a Bond film. Connery at his height. An actual mystery. Great action. A compelling antagonist. One of the best Bond girls. It's the best Bond film so far at this point in the early 60s.",Goldfinger
115,Spleen,The Five Orange Pips of the Bond canon,10,26 March 2001,"Let me tell you about ""The Five Orange Pips"".  The parallels run surprisingly deep.What makes a Sherlock Holmes story classic?  Quality, obviously; setting that aside, Holmes aficionado Ronald Knox proposed a list of a dozen or so key ingredients which may not be essential, but which fans will miss if they aren't there: the cosy opening in Baker Street, the introductory deduction which surprises Watson, the sudden appearance of a client ... we could recreate the list ourselves, if we wanted to.Out of all fifty-six Holmes short stories only one - ""The Five Orange Pips"" - contains all of Knox's ingredients.  It's surprising that any story does; more surprising still that it should turn out to be a story which unanimous opinion regards as a disappointment.  (Late in his life Conan Doyle published a list of his favourite Holmes stories, and Orange Pips was among them.  But this was during his spirits-and-fairies period.)  One big problem with the story is that Holmes is almost completely ineffectual: his client gets killed, it's largely his fault, and Conan Doyle doesn't even seem to notice.Yet it's not a BAD story.  The classic ingredients are there, and no lover of Holmes could fail to get some kick out of them.  We can't regard it as a failure in the way that some stories (""The Mazarin Stone"", ""The Veiled Lodger"") are failures.What does all this have to do with ""Goldfinger""?  The central disappointment is the same: our hero is surprisingly passive and ineffectual.  When he does do something likely as not it's an obvious blunder, even if it's not presented as such.  And (as in so many Holmes stories), the plot is silly. I can't say more without cautioning people who haven't seen ""Goldfinger"" to stop reading.  Stop reading.After our first viewing, we know that Bond has spent most of his time caged up, but we feel he must have done something worthwhile to justify our faith in him.  What, exactly?  The first thing he does is to get Jill Masterson killed - in the process, letting Goldfinger know who he is, and thus rendering all the ""undercover"" work he will later attempt, pointless.  In stopping Tilly Masterson from killing Goldfinger - she might have succeeded, he endangers her life, too, and indeed, she dies, too.  When he's captured and about to be killed he does everything in his power to convince Goldfinger to keep him alive.  Here he succeeds - yet it was his duty, as a spy, to die.  Alive, he is Goldfinger's pawn (subsequent events show what a useful pawn he is); dead, he would be replaced by another agent, and this second agent would stand a much greater chance of thwarting Goldfinger.  (If you ask me, as soon as Bond has been spared, he realises his mistake; I think his rudeness to Goldfinger is partly an attempt to goad the villain into killing him.)  Once secure in Goldfinger's stronghold nothing he attempts amounts to anything.(Speaking of Goldfinger's schemes, would it really matter if an atomic bomb were dropped in Fort Knox?  People would be killed, but I mean apart from that.  The gold is just sitting in the ground anyway; if it were irradiated for a century or so, people would be unable to touch it, which would mean that the US government would have to leave it ... sitting in the ground. Well now.  I can see why we can't let THAT happen.)I know what you're thinking.  Not quite ALL of Bond's plans come to nothing. Doesn't he persuade Pussy Galore to join the side of the angels, and isn't her intervention crucial in preventing tragedy?  Yes, but this is nothing to do with Bond.  When he's asked afterwards why she did this he is as surprised as anyone, and he says, half joking, ""I must have appealed to her maternal instinct.""  Actually, I think that's the truth.  I think that Bond in Goldfinger's stronghold was at once so resolute and so helpless that she took pity on him.  And you know what?  This single touch makes a story that would otherwise be completely pointless, interesting; as interesting as a good folktale, or one of Aesop's better fables.What really rescues ""Goldfinger"", though, is the other parallel with ""The Five Orange Pips"": broken down into its components, it is THE classic member of its series.  There's a good brassy title song, with Maurice Binder's best title sequence.  There's a fabulous set of Bond women.  Special mention must be made of Dink, played by Margaret Nolan, who's on screen for just a few seconds, but my God she's luscious.  Then there's that Amazonian bunch of female fighter pilots ... but ""Goldfinger"" reminds us how important that the female characters be INTERESTING, at least as narrative devices; the next woman of comparable interest came along 25 years later, in ""The Living Daylights"".  There's a good villain with absurd, yet frightening, henchmen. There's globe-trotting and scenery-chasing.  There's the sense of a spy trapped within what appears to be civilisation, unable to cry for help. There's gadgetry and adventure.  There's a last-minute bomb defusing. There's a memorable death.  Goldfinger has EVERYTHING.  It may be the only Bond film to do so.  And here's the amazing thing: despite having a passive, ineffectual hero - this is less of a flaw than it would otherwise be because his passive ineffectuality rises to the level of mythic - all of these ""inessential"" Bond elements are enough to make ""Goldfinger"" the best Bond film ever made.  (Well, not quite.  Best is ""From Russia with Love"".  But ""Goldfinger"" is close.)  It's here that the parallel with Five Orange Pips breaks down.",Goldfinger
116,RatedVforVinny,On a golden Bond.,9,22 March 2019,"I'm stretching this right up to a 9, because I think it was the best Bond film ever made.

Oh, sure, it's better than the B-movie nuclear age balderdash that was Dr. No, but only because it obviously had a much larger budget.The five-decade decline of the franchise begins in the opening scene, when Bond makes a dyck joke about his gun. So juvenile. It gets worse from there, with a villain who is just a pasty, fat loser with delusions of grandeur. And a sidekick ripped straight from the pages of Marvel Comics.I have no idea how this could be considered the best Bond film, unless by ""best,"" fans simply mean it highlights all the Bondian elements: cheap double entendres, pointless semi-nudity, cartoon villains, and falshy, empty stunts.",Goldfinger
118,Kingslaay,The Gold standard,9,4 June 2017,"Goldfinger is almost a universal favorite for Bond fans and audiences and it's not hard to see why. Goldfinger introduces some key Bond elements that later become a formula for future successful Bond films. You have a great car equipped with gadgets, a great villain and henchman, great Bond girl, soundtrack and off course, Sean Connery. Sean Connery is in his element for this film and it shows. Many people put forward their actor who they think is the best Bond but in Goldfinger and Thunderball Connery shows he IS James Bond. Goldfinger is perhaps one of the greatest villains in Bond history as his plans are evil and ingenious. The Bond girl played by Honor Blackman is superb and probably the first Bond girl who shows she can hold her own and is very much his equal. The action sequences, plot and direction of this film was fantastic. Goldfinger is easily one of the greatest Bond films and its elements used became a standard formula to be applied in future Bond movies.",Goldfinger

Old James Bond movie ""GoldFinger"", the 3rd installment of James Bond is one of those movies in the latter dated categories. Directed well by Guy Hamilton and featuring Sean Connery, the movie has a great and subtle performance from the villain more simple and calm than any Bond movie before or since played by German actor Gert Frobe, a refreshing change. Unfortunately Much of the effects, sounds, and modeling look laughable. At one point you have Frobe ridiculously waving a gold gun around after switching costuming, and terrible cheap looking toy models looking out of old Godzilla movies. The Bond women in the film are less than memorable, although you have Pussy Galore, the most memorable character name in the series.

120,Chase_Witherspoon,The game changer,7,26 November 2012,"While some would regard this as the penultimate Bond adventure, though I think it's sturdy with memorable villains, it's the film that really shifted the tone from espionage thriller to the more hokey humorous subtext for which Bond became synonymous over the next twenty years of the franchise. Bond tackles the eccentric billionaire Auric Goldfinger (Frobe) and his motley crew of assassins, Oddjob (Sakata, one of the all-time best villains) and Pussy Galore (Blackman) on his way to a daring heist aiming to ransack Fort Knox.Shirley Eaton is the ill-fated first Bond girl and customary casualty, Tania Mallet adding a third damsel to Bond's list of distress and Canadian actor Cec Linder plays the CIA man Felix Leiter in his second incarnation. Minor roles are filled by stalwarts Martin Benson and Burt Kwouk among the usual Bond outfit (Lee, Maxwell, Llewellyn).The golfing match in which Bond trumps Goldfinger is a classic film moment, Oddjob's statue-destroying response manifests his boss' displeasure at being out-maneuvered, a forceful statement of intimidation that, predictably, Bond fails to heed, heading for an equally memorable encounter with a laser beam (in which Goldfinger and his cronies have so much faith, that no one stays to ensure Bond is actually bisected as planned, with predictable results). It's the transition from the conservative, straight Bond into the cavalier kind of hokum that elevates Bond above mere mortals into the realms of fantasy, though it remains an entertaining film in its own right.",Goldfinger
121,brando647,The Most Iconic Entry in the 007 Franchise,8,17 May 2013,"GOLDFINGER is the quintessential 007 movie. It's been spoofed, referenced, praised, and paid homage countless times. Seriously, I'm pretty sure just about every television series that's existed since the 1960s had made some reference to GOLDFINGER in some form. No matter what your opinion of the movie, no matter where your 007 tastes run, you absolutely have to respect the third James Bond adventure for what it was: the first 007 movie with all of the familiar tropes that will continue through the series until the 2006 reboot. GOLDFINGER marks the first time we see Bond visiting Q in his lab to receive gadgets, not just a briefcase with hidden compartments and a Walther. We're talking real 007 gadgets. Case in point: Bond's Aston Martin DB5, one of the most iconic movie vehicles in cinema. We have our first memorably over-the-top villain with fantastical plans that go above and beyond your average criminal. And then, to top it all off, we have the first official Bond movie theme. Sure, DR. NO had Monty Norman & John Barry's actual 007 theme music but I'm talking about a special song written purely for the opening sequence of the picture in question. Shirley Bassey's GOLDFINGER established a standard for all 007 movies that followed. Regardless of my opinion, this movie set the (no pun intended) gold standard for the franchise and helped it morph into what it is today. For that, GOLDFINGER should earn any Bond fan's respect and establishes it in my top favorite 007 films.So what do I actually feel about the picture? Well, I'm sure I've mentioned in my comments on some of the other Bond films that I was introduced to the franchise late in the game. The first 007 movie I saw was GOLDENEYE, and from there I transitioned into the Roger Moore era and didn't actually experience the original Connery films until later. So my Bond tastes tend to run with some of the more bizarre films with insane action set pieces and quirky villains, but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy the earlier films as well. The first few 007 movies were pretty tame in comparison: very grounded villains, basic action, a more suspenseful tone. In my opinion, GOLDFINGER (despite the gadget-laden DB5 and Oddjob's novel nature) still falls into this category. It's a slower paced film and, being the mid-60s, still contains some of the clichés of the era. That's OK to me. I can dig that. GOLDFINGER is not a movie that will get me pumped and have me eagerly awaiting the next exciting moment; it just sort of cruises along at it's own speed. To be honest, when I first saw this movie at a younger age, I wasn't impressed. It was too drawn out for me to get into it. It took a few more years and a few more viewings to start appreciating it and all of its elements. It gives me the impression that the newer generation of Bond fans, accustomed to the fast-paced action of the Daniel Craig era, might have a harder time appreciating GOLDFINGER (and a lot of the Connery films).As a villain, Auric Goldfinger (Gert Fröbe) is one of the best. He's charismatic, charming, and a little bit insane. He's the first 007 villain with a major quirk defining him, in this case his obsession with gold. Goldfinger is fantastic, and I love that he perfectly sums up the role of the Bond villain for every movie to follow in a single line of dialogue. In the scene of the film where Goldfinger is addressing a room full of his criminal colleagues about his plans for Operation: Grand Slam: ""Man has climbed Mount Everest, gone to the bottom of the ocean. He's fired rockets at the moon, split the atom, achieved miracles in every field of human endeavorexcept crime."" And so nearly every Bond villain that followed rose above common crime with mastermind aspirations, whether it be hijacking space capsules, obliterating the world's economy with bio-weapons, or flooding silicon valley to corner the microchip market. Of course, he wouldn't be a top Bond villain without a quality henchman. Oddjob (former wrestler Harold Sakata) is a great baddie for Bond to face: a silent killer with a razor-rimmed derby hat and an unquestioning loyalty to his boss. GOLDFINGER's Bond ""girl"" is Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore. She's one of the few Bond women who's tough enough on her own to hold her own in a fight or resist Bond's charms. She's tough, talented, and beautiful.With Sean Connery at his best, GOLDFINGER stands out as one of the best Bond films and has, for the most part, withstood the test of time. I hope new generations of fans, introduced through the Daniel Craig films and whatever comes after, will go back and check out movies such as GOLDFINGER to see where it all began.",Goldfinger
122,Gislef,Connery's Best,8,22 December 1998,"Goldfinger stands as the best of the Connery flicks, and probably in the top 5 of all Bond movies.  It is Connery at his best:  he's a bit more urbane than in his earlier Bond portrayals, and not the somewhat tired-out wisecracker of the later flicks.  His performances here and in Thunderball are about equal, but Goldfinger has a better plot and more interesting characters.  The dialogue between Goldfinger and Bond is incredibly well-crafted, from Goldfinger's ""I expect you to die"" to Bond's expressed admiration at Goldfinger's plan.  And then there's Oddjob, the ultimate Bond bad guy/henchman.  There's a few plot holes (why does Goldfinger gas and kill the mobsters after explaining his plan to them?), but this movie is basically the perfect synthesis between the Fleming novel (both in plot and in the portrayal of Bond) and the movies.  The script actually fixes some holes in Fleming's novel.  He has Goldfinger actually steal the gold, which is impossible for the reasons Bond notes in the movie.  Overall, well worth your time to watch.",Goldfinger

(PG)James Bond (Connery) tangles with a gold-obsessed madman (Fröbe) and his mute, formidable henchman (Sakata) in this top-notch franchise entry. The Bond formula was sealed here, set to be repeated for decades to come; although the story tends to be a bit shapeless at times and the final fate of its heavy is cartoonishly absurd even by these comic book thriller standards, the film is so bursting with extravagance, excitement and sly grace notes, that it can easily make the case for being the most purely entertaining entry in the entire series. Plenty of memorable images, one-liners, exchanges, gadgets and action scenes; the audacious villains are inspired and Blackman is one of the few ""Bond girls"" that's more than just a pretty face (able to hold her own and exert authority). The tricked-out Aston Martin DB5 still ranks as one of cinema's coolest automobiles. Shirley Bassey sings the title tune, and the style of her vocal performance would be echoed repeatedly in the years that followed. With its unprecedented marketing blitz, wide release, and record-setting box office, this is arguably the first true blockbuster.89/100",Goldfinger
124,mike48128,The Best Bond of Its Time- Grand Entertainment,9,8 January 2015,"Almost perfect in every way except for a few plot holes here and there, it's the films' style that makes this one the best. One could argue that newer Bond movies have better special effects or photography, but this is the one that everyone remembers. I have a few I hate (like ""Octopussy"") and a few that I like for the steel-toothed killer ""Jaws"" (the late Richard Keel). Other personal favorites include ""The Spy Who loved Me"" (Barbara Bock) and On His Majesties' Secret Service"" (great story). It's all about the cars, the music, the Golden Girl, Oddjob, Pussy Galores' Flying Circus (and her girls), and the silly bomb. In some ways, the screenplay is better than the book, and that's very rare. It all works. However, the card game and the golf match slow down the action, somewhat. Also, Pussy Galore prefers women to men. The love scene with James Bond is in both the novel and the movie, but it doesn't quite ring true, does it?",Goldfinger

It has brilliant set design, sophistication, amusing dialogue, fast pace, interesting props and machinery, a Grammy Award winning film score and Academy Award winning sound effects. Sean Connery plays the gentleman spy with a commanding air and with wit and charm, panache and good humour. Gert Frobe is perfectly cast as the titular villain, wearing criminal success proudly.
It is a farrago of stunts, voluptuous and kittenish females, gimmicks and gadgets and violence. It is also absurd and preposterous at times, mainly down to its hokum story - approaching spoof without quite arriving, thanks to a dose of self-mockery.",Goldfinger

To put the price of his gold up of course, i love it.James Bond has a different agenda, and will stop at nothing to foil Goldfingers plans, he'll even put his manhood on a platter for Goldfinger to test out his new Lazer.

127,sme_no_densetsu,Everything he touches turns to excitement!,8,22 February 2013,"Well, that's what the movie poster promised, anyway. And, for once, the poster wasn't lying. ""Goldfinger"", the third James Bond movie, is generally considered one of the very best of the 20 some odd entries in the James Bond series to date. In fact, before Daniel Craig breathed new life into the character this movie was basically seen as the quintessential Bond film.All of the ingredients that made James Bond a household name are present here. Globetrotting action? Check. Beautiful women? Check. A larger than life villain? Check. A memorable henchman? Check. Mordant humour? Check. You name it, ""Goldfinger"" has it.The movie centres around improbably named gold smuggler Auric Goldfinger, who is at the bottom of some decidedly villainous activity which our man Bond is tasked with uncovering. Along the way he meets the equally improbably named vixen Pussy Galore and Goldfinger's mute henchman, Oddjob. Each of these characters are among the most memorable in the Bond canon, due in no small part to the acting talents of Gert Frobe, Honor Blackman & Harold Sakata. Of course, due credit must also be given to Sean Connery who contributed his most assured Bond yet.Taking over from Terence Young, who directed the first two films, Guy Hamilton upped the ante with some highly memorable set-pieces. True, some rear projection & slightly questionable special effects detract a bit from the visuals but that's to be expected in a movie of this vintage. Musically, we're treated to one of the best Bond theme songs during the opening credits (courtesy of Shirley Bassey), not to mention one of John Barry's best scores.All in all, this seems to be the one James Bond movie where absolutely everything fell into place. To top it all off, the plot is full of twists and turns that continually take the viewer by surprise. In conclusion, if you want a taste of classic James Bond, ""Goldfinger"" is the one to see.",Goldfinger
128,coltras35,"Bond keeping things shocking, positively shocking",10,22 March 2021,"Sean Connery returns as 007 in the third Bond Film that is considered one of the best in the series. After the first two exercises in minimalism, Goldfinger loses that restraint and becomes a bit more outlandish, introducing more gadgets such as the iconic Aston Martin, and grander set-pieces. Actually it was Guy Hamilton's idea to make the series more snappy, more fun, ( he was influenced by the Saint tv series) and the result works, though there's still a shadow of minimalism.The story is straightforward: James Bond takes on the man with the Midas Touch, Auric Goldfinger, who has some diabolical plans. It has something to do with Fort Knox. There are many iconic scenes like Shirley Eaton coated in gold, and some good one-liners ( ""he's playing his golden harp."" ""Now I know what you mean by a crushing engagement.""). Even Auric Goldfinger, played coldly by Gert Frobe, has that excellent line (""do you expect me to talk?"" Asks Bond. Goldfinger replies, ""no, Mr Bond, I expect you to die."").The plot is brisk, though it slows down a bit when Bond is kept captive at a farm, but the climax makes up for that slight dragging bit. And if the big action sequence in Fort Knox, Bond's fight with the iconic henchman Oddjob, and the countdown of a bomb isn't enough, then Bond's confrontation with Goldfinger on a plane where Goldfinger has a fatal basic 101 about pressurisation.The late Honor Blackman is iconic as Pussy Galore, and adds some style to the proceedings. Definitely one of the best Bond films, yes, it's not perfect ( Goldfinger keeping Bond alive because just because he will be replaced by an agent who knows about the operation is a bit weak) but it's the ultimate in exciting escapist fare.",Goldfinger
129,pyrocitor,Everything he touches turns to excellence,10,31 August 2005,"What is there to say about Goldfinger that hasn't already been said thousands of times over again? There remains little doubt that it is the definitive James Bond film, and that it set the tone for every other one made since, as well as partially or strongly influencing virtually every action film ever made since. Goldfinger was an instant classic from the moment Bond rises from the sea with a fake duck disguise on top of his head to seducing his latest flame under a parachute at the close. Goldfinger introduced all the necessary elements for what we now know as a 'Bond film', which has practically been granted it's own genre: an outlandish, fantasy-oriented plot; a devious, fiendish and truly evil villain; a slew of beautiful women, all of whom just happen to fall for 007; lots of action setpieces; and most importantly of all, an overall sense of infectious fun which helps the Bond films rise above the rest of the films in their genres. We don't care if the villain's plot is so unbelievable it couldn't possibly work, or how unlikely it is that the hero can continue to survive over and over again, because the execution, never straying far from the initial formula is so enjoyable. And it was Goldfinger who introduced this formula, and set the bar for decades of entertainment after. And perhaps the reason that Goldfinger to this day, rises above pretty much every other action film made, is because not only was it the first film to introduce this now standard formula, but it also demonstrates how to successfully pull it off. Goldfinger (Gert Fröbe)'s master plan, to set off an atomic bomb inside Fort Knox to irradiate the gold depository, so that his own personal supply of gold will multiply in value, is outlandish enough, but there's something about it which demonstrates a subtle genius. Goldfinger himself is no common thief, he proves far too classy for such futile pursuits. His plan is outlandish, yes, but it is so unexpectedly elegant, you can't help but foster some belief that it could actually work. Bond's womanizing also really comes into play here, with him seducing belly dancer Bonita, (Nadja Rejin) Goldfinger's call girl Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton) and later, her sister Tilly, (Tania Mallet) and finally, the aptly named Pussy Galore, (Honor Blackman) one of author Ian Fleming's less subtle fantasies. Again, we could have interpreted the character of Bond as a slimy little bugger, but Sean Connery's immense charisma leads us into viewing Bond as the quintessential hero character, which has held since. Despite being dubbed, German actor Gert Fröbe brings considerable class and menace to the role of the title character, setting standards for villainy for years to come. Not only does Fröbe exactly match the character description from the novel, but he proves to be one of the most iconic villains of all time, as one of the first ""billionaire madmen"". It is he who gets most of the best lines of the film (see his speech about crime through the ages, and, of course, the timeless ""Do you expect me to talk?"" ""No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!""). However, it's his sidekick, the burly, yet immaculately dressed, razor edged bowler hat tossing Oddjob (Harold Sakata) who proves to be just as, if not more iconic. Not only did this introduce the concept of a sidekick, but also paved the way for some pretty imaginative weapons. Speaking of weapons, it should be mentioned that Goldfinger featured the debut of MI6 major Boothroyd as the beloved Q (Desmond Llewellyn) his deadpan sense of wry humour, and Bond's first really satisfying gadget: the Aston Martin, laden with smokescreen, oil slick, bulletproof mirrors, revolving license plate and ejector seat. And as the 'Bond girls' of the show, Shirley Eaton and Tania Mallet are certainly good looking enough, and even turn out half decent performances, unlike most of the Playboy rejects populating later Bond films. But it's Honor Blackman who really stands out, as the strong willed (and very suggestively named) Pussy Galore. Perhaps it's because she is one of the only women Bond has ever crossed who has managed to resist him until the very end of the movie, but Blackman adds a note of class to the film, proving a much more competent actress than most to follow.So for any who have yet to understand the Bond hype, this is the film to watch. It set the bar for virtually ever action film following it to date, in terms of truly evil villains; beautiful women; daring, death-defying stunts and gadgets; showcasing Sean Connery at his most suave and charismatic, proving to be the definitive James Bond. The definitive Bond in the definitive Bond film - if you haven't seen this movie yet, now you have a reason to do so. -10/10",Goldfinger
130,frankde-jong,Many gadgets don't automatically make a good movie,7,20 September 2021,"Already a filmbuff for 30 years, I didn't see a single James Bond movie. In september 2021 a channel on Dutch television programmed all James Bond films, so I decided it was time to watch at least a few of them. Before I write a review I usually check the opinion of some critics I have learned to appreciate, checking if and why their remarks differs from mine. Writing the James Bond reviews I noticed that also these critics had the habit of circumventing the James Bond movies.I chose the oldest three Bond movies. In the first place because lovers of the James Bond genre generally prefer Sean Connory, in the second place the IMDB ratings of the first three movies are well above average. This is rather remarkable because the production budget rose from approximately 1 million dollar for ""Dr No"" (1962) to 250 million dollar for ""No time to die"" (2021). Of course inflation explains part of the difference, but it once again proofs that money does not guarantee quality.James Bond is a typical English gentleman but the stories are also vaguely related to the Cold War. All the novels were written during this period. The relation to the Cold War is however quite different from the science fiction movies of the '50s. In these science fiction movies the aliens invariably stand for the Russians and the relationship is fear. In James Bond movies the Russians are not always the bad guys (the criminal organisation SPECTRE is the representation of all evil) but the emphasis on secret service unmistakably has some Cold War flavour. Also the relationship is not fear but action and thril.The James Bond franchise is all about: the bad guy, the Bond girl, the location and the gadgets. The films are meant for entertainment, so don't expect deep motives. I shall therefore review the individual Bond movies according to the above mentioned elements.The bad guy is played this time by the German Gert Fröbe, who had convinced earlier as a serial killer in ""Es geschah am hellichten Tag"" (1958, Ladislao Vajda). In ""Goldfinger"" his lust for gold makes him a super capitalist bad guy. The film is clearly made in the period of the golden standard, when it was still believed that the value of (and confidence in) money ultimately depended on its convertibility in gold.Several girls that could be potential Bond girls find an early death, just like Janet Leigh does not make it to halfway the movie in Alfred Hitchcocks ""Psycho"" (1960). In the end Pussy Galore (whats in a name?) played by Honor Blackman turns out to be the real Bondgirl of this film. With respect to sexappeal it is however a tough competition with her predecessor in ""From Russia with love"" (1963, Terence Young), who was more than 15 years her junior.The film begins in Switzerland and this leads to several car chases in a beautiful mountainous surrounding. Afterwards however the action moves to the plains of Kentucky, putting an end to enjoying the landscape.The one (and only) aspect in which ""Goldfinger"" clearly surpasses ""From Russia with love"" is the use of gadgets. Also the Aston Martin car of James Bond makes his debut in ""Goldfinger"". Curiously enough the most iconic gadget of the movie (a razor shap top hat) is not used by Bond but by his enemies.Often ""Goldfinger"" is considered as the best Bond movie ever. Even ""respectable"" critics deigned to write a review. Personally I like ""From Russia with love"" more. The emphasis on gadgets, begun in ""Goldfinger"" would permeate the Bond films more and more in later episodes.",Goldfinger
131,Sirus_the_Virus,"Not quite as good as FRWL, but still a great film.",9,9 September 2009,"Goldfinger is a Bond film that has grown far apart from Dr.No. I wasn't that crazy over the original Bond film. I liked it, yes, but there wasn't too much there. The second Bond film, From Russia with love, was fantastic and filled with excitement. Now here we are to the third entry in the bond series. Goldfinger is an exciting Bond film that I didn't like as much as From Russia with love but still loved it. Unlike Dr. No, I understood the plot and was entertained very much. I wasn't quite convinced that there was much chemistry between Honor Blackman(Pussy Galore) and Sean Connery(James Bond). The villains, from the beginning, you know are pretty evil. If you kill someone that bond has tapped then you're an evil bastard. I mean they weren't that evil but they were pretty bad. Goldfinger is a fun film to watch with a cool climax at Fort Knox. Goldfinger isn't quite as good as From Russia with love, but is still a fun film.Goldfinger: ***1/2 out of ****",Goldfinger
132,jeremycrimsonfox,A Golden Hit,9,26 March 2019,"Goldfinger, the third movie in the James Bond film franchise, is known as the film that set up blueprint for its future installments.

After socializing with him, he spies on him and finds out about Operation Grand Slam, he has to stop Goldfinger and his razor hat-throwing manservant, Oddjob, from rendering the gold in Fort Knox useless via the use of a dirty bomb.Once again, Sean Connery does a great job as 007. Auric Goldfinger, played by the late Gert Frobe, gives an incredible performance, and Harold Sakata plays Oddjob real good.

133,Joxerlives,Not the best Bond film as some claim but the one that set the model for the rest,8,6 February 2014,"Let's talk about the bad parts first. Sean Connery never even went to the US which is painfully obvious in some of the Miami Beach scenes (that said Fort Knox recreated at Pinewood Studios is absolutely marvellous and totally fools you). A totally forgettable Felix Leiter compared to JFK lookalike Jack Lord in Dr No and some amazing sexism, even for the 1960s (Bond giving his masseuse a spank on the hip and telling her to clear out as it's time for 'Men's talk'). Good god!The rest of it is almost uniformly terrific from the original Q issues Bond with his equipment scene to the famous laser beam threat and a terrific Bond girl in the shape of Honor Blackman (Bond really did have a thing of borrowing Avenger's actors, Honor Blackman here, Diana Rigg and Joanna Lumely in OHMSS and Steed himself Patrick MacNee in A View to a Kill). Goldfinger makes a wonderful villain and Oddjob a terrific henchman, both ably parodied by Austin Powers with Goldmember and 'Randon Task'. Interesting that Bond lambasts The Beatles (displaying Ian Flemings inherent snobbery?), especially given that Paul McCartney later records the theme tune for Live and Let Die (and Ringo Starr marries a Bond girl). This is really the Bond film that creates the formula for the rest of the series from the explosive finale with a set-piece big battle to the larger than life villain (celebrated in the epic theme song for the first time) and his equally colourful henchman. Plus we have the first Aston Martin Bond car and there was never one finer. Sad that Fleming never lived to see it (although he did watch the first 2 films and was impressed enough with Sean Connery to make Bond's father Scottish in the concurrent novels). That said the movies go to great lengths to humanise his hero who is a nasty piece of work on the printed page so you wonder what he would have thought?",Goldfinger
134,classicalsteve,Probably the Most Popular of the 1960's Bond Films Shows the Origins of the Modern Action Film,8,25 June 2017,"By the last couple of decades of the 20th century and into the first decades of the 21st century, action films became the highest grossing offerings from Hollywood. Prior to circa 1960, period dramas were more often the pictures which brought movie-goers into the theater seats with their popcorn: ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Spartacus"", ""Ben Hur"", etc. A few action-suspense films, such as those directed by Alfred Hitchcock and film noir, did also bring in the box office bucks. Westerns were probably the most prevalent action movie prior to James Bond but many of them were lower-budgeted B-films. In 1956, the only action movie among the top-10 grossing films was ""The Searchers"", a western starring John Wayne. All others in the top-10 were epic period pictures and dramas. However, by circa 2000, the reigning king of film genres became the action film. By 2014, 50 years later, all the top-10 grossing films were action-oriented including science fiction, fantasy and/or superhero. Unlike decades gone by, the highest-grossing films and best picture winners are almost never the same. The original James Bond films of the 1960's, particularly ""Goldfinger"", paved the way and included so many of the elements currently found in the genre. Firstly, the James Bond films were the first action films outside of detective films/series and Westerns to feature a recurring character in multiple offerings. Secondly, much of the genre's formula was established with ""Goldfinger"" and other Connery-Bond installments. The action doesn't begin with the main plot but instead begins with Bond engaged in another mission as a kind of ""prelude"" to the main story. This device has been used ever since ad infinitum, such as in some of the later Die Hard films with Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) which began in the late 1980's and even up to the Mission Impossible films starring Tom Cruise in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Thirdly, Bond makes little funny comments which has become such a trademark in entertainment action films. Often these comments are in the wake of a kill. For example, in ""Dr. No"", Bond kills a man with a bow and arrow and says, ""I think he got the point.""""Goldfinger"" became the second-highest grossing film of 1964 behind ""My Fair Lady"" and is probably one of the two best Connery/Bond films, the other ""From Russia with Love"". The plot is typical of many of the Bond stories: a kingpin criminal magnate, called simply Goldfinger, is suspected of smuggling large amounts of gold out of first-world nations and possibly reselling it to third world nations who pay more. (This couldn't happen today since international markets constantly track the price of gold.) James Bond (Sean Connery), Agent 007, is sent on a mission to find out about Goldfinger (Gert Fröbe). Turns out he's vacationing at the same hotel in Miami Beach as Bond! Then Bond turns up at a golf course where Goldfinger just happens to be playing. The informal gold, I mean golf competition, is worth the price of admission alone.The trail leads to a complex in Switzerland where Bond finds out about an operation called ""Grand Slam"". Bond doesn't know what Grand Slam is but is apprehended by the baddies in which Bond is shackled to a table and going to be sliced into pieces for 007 sandwiches by a laser. Bond must find out the nature of Goldfinger's scheme, but if he doesn't somehow get off the table, it will be Bond mince pies. Eventually he also meets Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman), a beautiful blond who knows automatic weapons, judo and airplane flying. She is part of Goldfinger's operation for the money and immune to Bond's ""charms"".A very enjoyable installment in the Bond canon and does uphold relatively well. Some of the sequences were a bit unbelievable by today's standards, such as Goldfinger puts only one guard on Bond initially. Of course the guard is not given reinforcements and Bond easily subdues him! (Goldfinger should be smart enough to use a lot more manpower to guard a hired assassin!) Although we may expect a bit more from action pictures (or may we don't!), the Bond cycle was the original blueprint which has influenced so many action films for over the next half-century. The series itself has continued at this writing with Daniel Craig as 007, for my money the best Bond since Connery. Still the Connery-Bond installments still provide good escapist entertainment. Pass the popcorn.",Goldfinger
135,hall895,A little silly but still enjoyable,6,16 May 2007,"Goldfinger is not a movie that is meant to be taken particularly seriously. And those involved in making the film, from the writers to the director to the actors were rather obviously well aware of this. The whole movie proceeds with tongue planted firmly in cheek. If you accept this you will probably enjoy the movie. Bad puns, ludicrous schemes, terribly contrived situations...this movie has all of that plus the character famously named Pussy Galore. It's as if the movie itself is winking at you. It's trying to be cute and sometimes goes a little too far. But all in all it's not a bad movie. Not a great movie either, but a reasonably good one. Sufficiently entertaining to make you forgive much of the silliness.The plot, such as it is, is typical James Bond. Bizarre villain with grand, if somewhat loony, plans for world domination or at the very least one heck of a financial windfall. Bond tries to stop said villain, Bond gets himself into seemingly hopeless situations, Bond manages to escape seemingly hopeless situations. And of course there's a beautiful woman with a ludicrous name to spice things up. As Bond, Sean Connery is the best thing the film has to offer. He's perfect for the role, so good you forgive him when he's forced to utter some truly groan-inducing one-liners. Suave and debonair but also brutally tough when he has to be...that's James Bond and Connery captures Bond perfectly. There's also Gert Fröbe as the villainous Goldfinger and Harold Sakata as Goldfinger's mute but menacing henchman Oddjob (again with the silly names). And a couple of key female roles for Shirley Eaton who gives a famously golden performance as the refreshingly normally named Jill Masterson and Honor Blackman as the aforementioned Pussy Galore. All involved give fine performances but none really shine like Connery. Well, in a way Eaton shines but that's another story altogether. It's Connery's film and when it works, it's he who makes it work. When it doesn't work, and there are certainly points in the film in which it doesn't, Connery salvages it. Yes, sometimes Goldfinger is a film which is a little too cute for its own good. But it's still a mostly enjoyable and entertaining ride.",Goldfinger
136,Beta_Gallinger,"With more action and humour, this film definitely showed improvement after its two predecessors!",9,12 June 2008,"I've recently started to watch the James Bond films in order, so I watched this one after ""Dr. No"" (for the second time) and ""From Russia with Love"". I found the first two reasonably impressive, but nothing great. Knowing that ""Goldfinger"" (which quickly followed ""From Russia with Love"", just like that film quickly followed ""Dr. No""), was more popular than its two predecessors, I expected it to be superior to both of them, and was not let down. I saw some of the same elements as in the first two films, along with more, and my expectations may have actually been slightly surpassed! James Bond is on vacation in Miami Beach, Florida, but is soon informed about Auric Goldfinger. Bond's vacation is now over, as he now must watch this man, who is currently in Miami Beach as well! Bond falls in love with Jill Masterson, who works for Goldfinger, but he is soon knocked out, and when he regains consciousness, he discovers that Jill has died from skin suffocation after being covered in gold paint! Back in England, Bond learns more about Goldfinger, how he is suspected by the Bank of England of being behind the stockpiling of mass quantities of gold! So, Bond sets out to investigate by becoming social with the suspect, but eventually finds himself in captivity after being caught spying on him! After being taken to the United States, Bond gradually learns about Goldfinger's sinister plot to raid Fort Knox! Like the first two Bond films, we still have Sean Connery playing the main character and doing a great job. Of course, we can always expect romance in these Bond films, and the romance here usually works fairly well, including Bond trying hard to seduce Pussy Galore, Goldfinger's pilot. Aside from that, ""Goldfinger"" definitely has more action than its two predecessors, not that action alone can make a film (I think of the vastly overrated action movie, ""Speed"" when I say that), but in this film, it definitely makes for some good excitement! I found that the story gradually gets better as it goes along, with a significant number of thrilling moments, definitely more so than in ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia with Love""! Even during less intense scenes, I was still usually at least in mild suspense. I also noticed a bit more humour in the film, which helps, and the Aston Martin that Bond is sent on the mission in, with all its special gadgets, is something that you won't see anything like in the previous films.Overall, this third installment in the James Bond movie series is a memorable and solid action epic, and I can see why it's more highly rated than the previous two, since I've found it so entertaining. (Mind you, if I were female, parts of the film, such as the way Bond gets a woman to leave so he can have his ""man talk"", probably would have irked me a bit.) Some people who have found ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia with Love"" disappointing could be relieved by certain changes in ""Goldfinger"", including the increase in action, if the lack of action is what disappointed them about the first two installments, as well as an increase in humour and budget. If you want the merits of the previous films added with these things, ""Goldfinger"" is a classic Bond film that will probably entertain you fairly consistently, if not VERY consistently, throughout its 110 minute run.",Goldfinger
137,vip_ebriega,One the best James Bond movies ever.,10,12 May 2010,"Is it possible to talk about James Bond movies without having to bring up GOLDFINGER? I guess not. This is probably the most popular entry in the series, and arguably one of the best of James Bond. It's not art for sure, but it's a great film and great fun. It gets everything right. The characters are iconic (can anyone forget about Mr. Goldfinger? Or what about Oddjob and his now iconic bowler hat? Do we not still wonder if we're dreaming whenever Pussy Galore introduces herself to Bond?), the gadgets are absolutely memorable and a pattern for all the other Bond movie gadgets in future installments, and above all its carried by Sean Connery's suave portrayal of Bond; could anyone be cooler than Connery when reciting lines as ""Bond... James Bond""? The plot is relatively more simple than the later template for James Bond movie plots. Like FROM Russia WITH LOVE, this was much closer to the Ian Fleming portrayals. Bond is sent to investigate on the mysterious billionaire Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) whose business as a gold dealer may have something to do with the stockpiling of gold bullion in the Bank of England. His investigation leads him to the discovery of Operation: Grandslam, Goldfinger's ultimate plan to gain control of the world's economy.Like all classics, those who already saw GOLDFINGER will probably be aware of its influences to, not just the series, but similar films in the genre altogether. Just as well, those who haven't seen it will be pleasantly surprised that a lot of notable elements are probably derived from this film. It's so iconic in many ways. Still, there are moments of camp and age here and there, especially in some of the rear-projection work, but that's too little reason to dent the film (as a matter of fact, who cares if its a little dated? it's as if they had the technology we had when they made this film!). Overall, GOLDFINGER ranks high with the best of the Bonds, and probably one of the best in spy adventure movies ever.Rating: ***** out of 5.",Goldfinger
138,one9eighty,Making the future Bond template - using gold,8,9 July 2020,"The third James Bond film, the third outing for Sean Connery as the titular super spy, and, let us be honest, the one that most people remember. This is the film that really launched the Bond franchise into the Worldwide mainstream:The global earnings from this film were recouped in just two weeks.A lot of the Bond canon/ themes you know today were firmly established in this film.This film has been parodied, spoofed, and paid homage to in other films in one way or another regularly since its release in 1964.Before I get into my review, let us get a brief synopsis out of the way...Holidaying after a successful mission that is not seen on screen Bond finds himself in Miami. He is contacted by M, via CIA agent Felix Leiter, who wants him to investigate gold bullion dealer Auric Goldfinger. Eventually Bond uncovers a plot which would throw the worlds economy into chaos, while making Goldfinger one of the richest and powerful people in the world. Something that Bond obviously must thwart for the good of everyone.While the last two films had Bond dealing with S.P.E.C.T.R.E. this one is different, the agent of chaos is not affiliated with the evil organisation but is a menace in his own right. German actor Gert Fröbe plays Goldfinger brilliantly, one mood swing away from being outright evil, he plays a powerful and confident bad guy. His henchman, Oddjob (Harold Sakata), commands as much of the limelight in this film as Goldfinger himself does - despite having a single line of dialogue in the entire film. Oddjob is the first (random yet) iconic henchman to appear in a Bond film. Also making an appearance, Honor Blackman is Pussy Galore, a confident, strong, and deadly operative. Pussy Galore is the first real use of tongue-in-cheek name in a Bond film - and it definitely isn't the last either! Shirley Eaton briefly appears; her final scene in particularly is one of the most iconic scenes in the entirety of the Bond franchise history (which is also later recreated for 'Life' magazine too). Already you have some of the elements that you would expect to see in a Bond film canon - a criminal mastermind with plot to rule world (who, for the record, DOES have a giant laser), evil and random henchman who poses a massive physical threat to Bond, a femme fatale who is potentially as dangerous as Bond and could have an impact the plot, naive and delicate objects of affection for Bond to lust over... but there is more yet!Gadgets and technology take off in a big way in this film, Q has plenty of things that Bond can use to save the day. Nothing more so than the Aston Martin DB5 that he gets introduced to: Ejector seat, smoke screen, machine guns, oil slick, tire shredding blades, auto changing number plate... just wow! The car was one of the catalysts to a merchandise boom - Corgi made millions of replicas of it for kinds (and 'young' adults) the world over.A pre-credits action sequence which does not directly link to the current plot they are about to see unfold on the screen, but does introduce the audience to the film event they are about to witness - a blueprint for all future Bond films.Speaking of credits, this was the first use of a popular artist singing over the opening credits in a Bond film. Shirley Bassey would go on to sing another 2 Bond songs too, but this is where it started. This wasn't the first time this had been used in film, but the 60's saw a massive rise in this as film executives tried to influence younger audiences by using popular music or artists. Nowadays the reveal to find out who is singing on the next Bond film is always an event in itself - Goldfinger started this! (Yes, Matt Monro sang on ""From Russia with Love"", but other than on the radio in the background of one of the scenes, it was a post-credits song rather than something to kick things off.)Bond meeting the bad guy early in the film and toying with them. Okay, Bond does meet ""Dr No"" in the film, but not as early as he meets ""Goldfinger"". There is a card game and a golf game before any of the real 'games' start.Convoluted and over complicated torture is seen for the first time in this film via a giant laser. This is the first Bond film to have this occur, and it isn't the last - and of course this is parodied in other films in the future. (""You expect me to talk?"" ""No Mr Bond, I expect you to die!"") (see any ""Austin Powers: The Spy who shagged me"" for a perfect example.)Tongue in cheek humour and script.o Knocks electric fan into bathtub, kills bad guy ""Shocking! Positively Shocking""
o Gesturing to crushed car with dead bad guy ""As you said, he had a pressing engagement""
o ""Auric Goldfinger. Sounds like a French nail varnish.""Despite setting the franchise up with some many 'Bondian' elements and themes ""Goldfinger"" does it in a way that still allows it to remain cool, classy and stylish. Making it stand up as a forerunner in Bond films for many many years to come.As already mentioned, this recouped its budget in two weeks - it had a budget bigger than both the previous films combined ($2m at the time, equivalent to $25m today). At the time of its release ""Goldfinger"" was the fastest grossing film in history - and that was from just 64 screens!!Unlike the previous films, this is not a Terence Young directed film, he would be back for ""Thunderball"", but the change of directorship with Guy Hamilton taking the reins breathed a different lease of life into the franchise, without actually spoiling anything. One of the things that Hamilton insisted on is making Bond less of a superhero, making the villain more threatening - which is evident throughout, and especially at the end of the film while Bond is trapped with Oddjob and a bomb inside Fort Knox.Richard Maibaum returns as a writer, but he was replaced with Paul Dehn, but then rehired to replace Dehn (I'm not getting into that on here!).After being introduced to the franchise on ""From Russia with Love"", John Barry was given full control on score on this film. He made it his aim to produce a theme which matched the concept of the film, he took the word 'gold' literally and made a metallic heavy score which relied on lots of brass instruments. He wrote the song that Shirley Bassey would go on to sing. He also used elements of that song through out the film to pad out scenes and situations, as an example, he used notes from the song when Goldfinger is on screen, or when Oddjob is approaching menacingly. Working with Barry it was Norman Wanstall that took the lead for editing the sound effects into a something palatable and complimentary to the film. Wanstall went on to win an Oscar for Best Sound Effects Editing.The strength of this Bond film opened the door for lots of other film and TV secret agents in the 60's and beyond; The Man from Uncle, Avengers, Danger Man... but let's not just stop there. As mentioned right at the start of this review, films throughout the years have spoofed or paid homage to this film; ""Last Action Hero"", ""Austin Powers"", ""The Ipcress File"", ""Cars 2"", ""The Cannonball Run"", and ""Die Hard"" to name but a few.While this may not be everybody's favourite Bond film, it was the one that set the tone for nearly every future Bond film in the future. It created standards and themes that would shape the franchise for better or worse. Not just the standard bearer for Bond, but for spy films going forward. ""Goldfinger"" was the first Bond film to win an Oscar and due to it is impact it does not surprise me at all (1 Oscar win and at least 3 more award nominations to be more accurate). Before I get carried away and turn this into an essay about the film I will wrap up and say that I would recommend this film, it is slightly dated but is still a great experience. Judging it by today's standards would be foolish, this is film from the 1960's when life, art, culture and film was different - at it's time this film was the cream of the crop. By today's standard this is family friendly action/spy movie that is still entertaining. Why not waste away your next rainy Saturday afternoon with this great film.In terms of Bond films this is an 9 out of 10.In terms of movies in the long and illustrious history of film I would give this an 8 out of 10.",Goldfinger
139,johno-21,The gold standard of the Bond formula is established,9,15 June 2006,"I saw this during it's initial theatrical release when I was kid and have seen it many times since. I had not seen the previous two Bond films before this so it my introduction to the series and has probably earned a sentimental spot for me because of that. Sean Connery is back as James Bond 007 and his mission is to stop a power hungry corrupt and menacing bullion tycoon who has plans to raid Ft. Knox and become the world's most powerful man. Following the success of Dr. No and From Russia With Love, Bond producers Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman set the stage for all other Bond films with Goldfinger and really opened the doors for the action figure genre. A great opening sequence with perhaps the most memorable Bond themes of all sung by Shirley Bassey, a great villain in Goldfinger as played by Gert Fröbe, a very unique villains sidekick in Topjob and his steel-lined razor-sharp bowler derby, Bond girls in Honor Blackman and Shirley Eaton, John Barry's music, Bond's specially equipped and outfitted Autin Martin and the barrage of high tech gadgets and action are all here. Broccoli/Saltzman would produce together the first nine Bond films and after Saltzman sold his interest Broccoli would continue as the producer of the next eight Bond films. Richard Maibaum who wrote the screenplay for 13 of the Bond films adapted Goldfinger from the Ian Flemming novel. Guy Hamilton is the film's director who return to directing three more Bond films The Man with The Golden Gun, Live And Let Die and Diamonds Are Forever in the 1970's. Ted Moore who was the cinematographer of the first two Bond films is back in Goldfinger and he would do the next four in the Bond series as well as winning an Academy Award for a film away from the series in A Man For All Seasons. Also among the cast are Harold Sakata, Tilly Masterson, Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell. I would give this an 9.0 out of 10.",Goldfinger
140,DarthBill,Finger of Gold,7,16 April 2004,"No SPECTRE anywhere, this time Bond's up against Auric Goldfinger and Odd-Job in what turns out to be a plot to knock over Fort Knox. Bond battles Odd-Job in a hilariously bad fight and has his way with Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman) in the hay (how do they do that, making love in the hay? Don't they ever get hay in uncomfortable places?).By now, Sean had his Bond performance down to a science and was clearly in the swing of things. Gert is dubbed as Goldfinger but appears to be enjoying himself. Honor Blackman's a nice blond. Ironically, Harold Sakata, the wrestler turned actor who played razor rimmed Odd-Job, was said to be a very nice man in real life and was shown playing with a bunch of kids in some archive footage from the making of ""Goldfinger"".This also features one of the best Bond themes ever, sung by Shirley Bessy no less (also the singer of ""Diamonds Are Forever"" and ""Moonraker""), the naked woman killed by being painted in gold and features that classic Astin Martin that we associate with Bond.""Congratulations on your... promotion, Goldfinger.

141,gkeith_1,Loved the music,10,9 May 2009,"Loved the music. Classic theme. Very famous. Bond awesome. Sean Connery, the only Bond I can watch. Aston Martin fabulous car. Always enjoy seeing the weapons in action. Always love seeing Oddjob and his murderous hat. Women very beautiful. Bond a lucky guy. Too bad Miss Monypenny was always pining after him. Now, there was a real human being. Goldfinger himself a laughingstock buffoon, positioned against the very suave 007 Bond, James Bond. James Bond always wins, and never forget that. He is smooth, debonair and a ladykiller. I feel that this was the movie that really put Sean Connery on the map.Contrast this with a later movie I saw of Connery, called ""The Name of the Rose"". Connery plays a monk as well as detective, trying to ferret out murderous crime from a crooked medieval monastery. Instead of driving a fabulous car, he pilots a slow mule. Instead of fabulous clothes, he wears monkish robes. Instead of fabulous women, the evil babe of the movie goes to his co-star, Christian Slater.I still love Connery as James Bond, and wish he had never quit the franchise. He was the greatest.",Goldfinger
142,stamper,Do you expect me to talk?,7,28 January 2002,"Well, yes actually, I mean this is supposed to be a comment. So what is there to say. Well first of all we have a classic theme song here accompanied by one of the best Bond villain's ever, but somehow all of this is not quite enough. There seem to be a few parts missing here. The pace is pretty slow, there are only a few of those famous one  liners plus the villains helper (in this case Oddjob) is a bit too much for me. OK it's not uncommon in Bond films that some of the villains are almost indestructible, but this is not a good version of it. Still this film is pretty entertaining, although it has it's lacks.

143,ivo-cobra8,Quintessential James Bond 007 Sean Connery's best film my favorite,10,9 November 2017,"Goldfinger (1964) is Quintessential James Bond 007 it is my number one all time favorite James Bond 007 film from Sean Connery. This one, You Only Live Twice and DR. No from Sean Connery are really my top three all time favorite James Bond 007 films. This was originally the first James Bond film I saw as a kid. Goldfinger was also my dad's favorite James Bond film and in years it become a cult classic. Even for 53 year old movie it still a classic the best 007 flick. I love it to death, I am enjoying it and I have so much fun watching it. This movie has so much action, action, action and more action. Sean Connery does an excellent performance as James Bond 007 I'm a hard-core James Bond fan. I make no apologies for believing that even the late Sean Connery is the closest thing we've seen to IAN FLEMING's James Bond. Everyone who watched this movie know is a really good Bond movie.The reason why is this movie so good: - James Bond has new cool car Aston Martin DB5 build with smoke screen in which can throw a co driver seat out of the car and the revolving licence plate. The car also has other applications such as: 30 calibre machine guns, Tire-shredding blade, Oil smoke and water emitters. Actress Shirley Eaton as the murdered Jill Masterson-"" is one of the most enduring images in cinematic history. The girl is painted with gold and dies. Memorable and cool villains like are: Auric Goldfinger and Oddjob ( Goldfinger's second henchman.) Oddjob wears a Sandringham hat with a sharpened steel rim, he is using it as a lethal weapon in the style of a chakram. The movie has great sexy beautiful girls like Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore, Shirley Eaton as Jill Masterson and Tania Mallet as Tilly Masterson. Cool dialogues I love it so much.""Do you expect me to talk? No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!"" This was directed by director Guy Hamilton it was his first James Bond 007 film the first two films were directed by Terence Young in which he directed Thunderball next Bond movie after this one. This movie also didn't evolve around SPECTRE this time like was in the first two film it was about a brilliant mastermind criminal in which he planed to blow off Fort Knox to get more profits for his Gold brilliant! It has beautiful great music score by John Barry I love it. The car Aston Martin DB5 James Bond 007 was driving was so cool, it has so many accessories it was beautiful to watch it.Investigating a gold magnate's smuggling, James Bond uncovers a plot to contaminate the Fort Knox gold reserve.This movie has so much impact it is well acted it has great brilliant plot.Gert Fröbe R.I.P was brilliant and excellent as Goldfinger the original villain. He gave his powerful performance as the bad guy from the title of the movie. I love him in this movie.Harold Sakata R.I.P. as Oddjob was great villain just like Goldfinger, he was really strong and excellent in hand to hand combat. Oddjob and Jaws are two great Bond villains.Honor Blackman is the first of a long line of James Bond females with patently sexual names And ho could ever forget Shirley Eaton's introduction in the film? She is lying on a chaise longue on the balcony of Goldfinger's Miami Beach hotel suite, attired in black bra and panties, while she observes Mr. Simmons' (Austin Willis) gin hand through binoculars.What more could you ask for? Well, how about a film in which Bond actually *does* something? For the whole 2nd half of this movie he's just a prisoner who fails every attempt to escape, signal his superiors or even deactivate the bomb himself. Even killing Oddjob at the end is ultimately meaningless as he's still trapped in the vault with a bomb he can't disarm until the Army rescues him.Goldfinger is a 1964 British spy film and the third instalment in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions, starring Sean Connery as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. It is based on the novel of the same name by Ian Fleming. The film also stars Honor Blackman as Bond girl Pussy Galore and Gert Fröbe as the title character Auric Goldfinger, along with Shirley Eaton as the iconic Bond girl Jill Masterson. Goldfinger was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman and was the first of four Bond films directed by Guy Hamilton.10/10 Goldfinger and The Spy Who Loved me has such a great villains and they are both in my top 10 James Bond favorite films. I just love and enjoy watching this film. Goldfinger in my opinion is MILES way better then Daniel Craig's last three films he did. This movie deserves a cult classic status movies like this will never be so good like was Goldfinger. It is quintessential James Bond 007 action cult classic film I love this movie to death it is my number one favorite Sean Connery's James Bond 007 film.",Goldfinger
144,The_Movie_Cat,The Degeneration of Bond,7,16 June 1999,"Goldfinger, the third in the Bond series, should, in many ways, be considered the worst of the three. There is the contrived storyline, that has Connery playing an entirely reactive role throughout. The megalomanic villain that goes to the trouble to explain his plan in detail to associates he's about to kill. The increased reliance on gadgets (though for once, Q introduces a gadget Bond doesn't get to use in the movie - the ejector seat), the silly names for girls (Pussy Galore, anyone?) the grandoise set-pieces and the unrealistic wisecracking. Perhaps most importantly, Bond reveals he's not a fan of the Beatles. Whereas prior outings had given us a niave Bond, here we get a smug incarnation that finds constant amusement despite his own ineptitude throughout. Possibly the only thing he succeeds in is in turning Pussy to his side. However, despite - or perhaps, because of - these elements, Goldfinger succeeds. Noticeably pacier than the earlier vehicles, boredom never sets in amidst all the incredulity. The pinnacle of the 60's Bonds and one of the best-worst movies ever.",Goldfinger
145,bankofmarquis,Aging like a fine wine,9,8 February 2015,"The 3rd film in the James Bond franchise is the one where the patterns are clearly established and the outcome is the first TRUE James Bond movie as we have come to know them. Director Guy Hamilton takes all the pieces that were established in the first two Bond movies - action, suspense, strong villains, exotic locales and beautiful women - by Terrence Young and adds something that wasn't there before - a slight tongue-in-cheek attitude that brings the fun with the action. It pays off wonderfully well.Connery, as Bond, has really settled into this role, add to that the relationships beginning to be established with M (Bernard Lee), Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell), FBI Agent Felix (this time played by Cec Lider) and, especially Desmond Llewelyn as ""Q"". It was director Hamilton who came up with the idea that ""Q"" should not like Bond as he doesn't take good care of the equipment he gives him. This is a genius idea and brings a welcome, different interaction with Bond.But, make no mistake, this movie is about the villains and dames - and what great villains and dames they are! Gert Frobe has a commanding presence as Auric Goldfinger while Honor Blackmon easily goes toe to toe with Connery as Pussy Galore. Add to this one of the best henchmen of all time - Harold Sakata's Oddjob - and Bond has his hands quite full.This movie holds up very well 50 years later. Like a fine wine, it has aged gracefully.9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",Goldfinger

147,rzajac,"Pure Action. A little *too* pure, in fact",6,26 August 2010,"From time to time I watch flicks like Goldfinger out of historical interest.Let's face it: The only thing Goldfinger has going for it today is its function as a window into the hazy, shapeless dawn of the action genre.Yes, there's a plot. But by modern standards Goldfinger seems like a beddy-bye story told by a tired, tipsy dad who's returned from a dinner party, paid off the babysitter, and found that the kid is still awake, and wants a story. The dad's tactic: Just sit at the foot of the bed and start creating a story-like thing. Don't worry if the story is good or makes much sense; just throw in characters and action and pretenses of interaction 'til the kid's asleep.It's sometimes the case that movies can play fast and loose with verite, and get away with it--as long as there's a gorgeous overarching myth. What's the myth of Goldfinger? An amoral man obsessed with gold, who smuggles gold from country to country. He also hatches a plan (no spoilers) that pushes this to another level. But it's still a feeble myth. This leaves us with a vague sense that the ""bad"" characters' motivation derives from a general sense of badness/accessory to badness. You can't do this on screen anymore. Or: You can, but only if 1) you're making camp, or 2) the actors are so incredibly good that they actually have the power to make it work. Rare (very), but it does happen.So the plot is necessarily pushed forward by feeble expedients. A guard enters 007's cell, merely because 007 was acting a little peculiarly. He was in a stone-walled, underground cell with steel doors, unarmed. As long as he's in that cell, he's utterly at your mercy; there's really nothing to do. But, you have to push the creaky plot forward, so... into the cell the guard goes! And it goes on and on like this, like early Tintin.Bereft of mythic power, one is left to bask in the breathtaking glow of its jillions of discontinuities, breaches of factual basis, and plot holes.Apart from the top guns, largely merely functional acting. You see so many takes that should have wound up on the cutting room floor except, one supposes, that at the end of the day it's the best they had.The only reason I give this film a '6' is because there's enough attention to certain rudiments of film narrative and production that it's not abysmal, and its shortcomings should make a useful study for film students.",Goldfinger
148,FilmMan47,Worth Watchable Only Because Of Guy Hamilton's Direction,6,17 March 2015,"Bond films are something not easy as there is a lot to talk about as a viewers one of the reasons is that each film holds something new and a lot of dimensions to discuss the case with gold finger is nothing new the critics and many fans around the world and reviewers here on IMDb have already explained this many times.Goldfinger is not everyone's cup of tea to be honest because the narrative and pace is the slowest all the good action scenes come in bits and pieces.I won't go into further detail but i would say this is certainly not a Oscar material as i personally feel Dr No got robbed its 50 years now it deserves it.This movie got everything in it the gadgets,hot women,the famous Aston Martin car with gadgets but it missing out on the excitement part and goes for more into the depth of the storyline and tension between the bad guys and Bond.Good script and dialogs but few things bugged a lot like the air plane climax when gold finger floats like a balloon and goes out and dies this scene was also given another treatment in die another day 2002.I don't know if you can call this a plot hole or not since the book was written this way i mean why bond is quite weak here and he is also getting owned by bad guys specially Oddjob he is quite possibly the worst henchman ever in films i don't get it why is he so overrated by the masses all he got is his round hat with a blade attached to it so he can throw it around like a Frisbee and cut people in half other then that he is pretty annoying half of the film is difficult to watch because of him.Positive points are the score and soundtrack with the voice of Shirley Bassey just wow what a vocal range she holds but i prefer her diamonds are forever theme over this any day.The Plot:agent 007 goes after auric gold finger a famous gold smuggler who is planning to create havoc in fort Knox by causing a radioactive bomb blast there so the gold becomes useless for the us government for a century this is all part of his plane called operation grand slam now how bond solves this mission the answer is in the film.It's got classic lines though one famous one is do you expect me to talk?no Mr bond i expect you to die flowed by a amazing laser sequence and who can forget the greatest moment in cinematic history when one bond girl Jill Masterson gets covered in gold paint in the bed once again another homage of this scene can be spotted in Quantum of Solace 2008.The climax is pure hilarious and unexpected the entire film is serious but all of a sudden it becomes goofy scenes like sleeping gas the army gets knocked out still it looks awesome i was just thinking why did Goldfinger not used a sleeping bomb over the city so everyone can sleep for hours so he could smuggle the gold out easily his whole scheme is silly on top of that he appears on ground himself and is joking around with bond.All the flaws are forgiven totally this film is worth while and enjoyable because of one man the director Guy Hamilton a lot of people hate him but i put him up in my list as he is easily one the best directors ever in the world he made more films after this and to sum up in few words he made bond epic more then any other director.The Cast:Sean Connery returns with more smoothness and charm,Gert Frobe was funny,Honor Blackman is the bond girl here named pussy galore this name sounds inappropriate but she was so tough here that she even beats up bond in many scenes.Guy Hamilton saved this project from being a total disappointment props to him this was not an easy film to make.Overall Goldfinger 1964 in general is not just for James Bond 007 or Sir Sean Connery Fans but for all the film buffs out there my rating is 6/10.Recommended",Goldfinger

NO and THUNDERBALL, the best of the Sean Connery as James Bond movies.The story is simply one of the best for a Bond movie, the movie is full of action sequences, the acting is great, and the theme song by Shirley Bassey is just a delight to hear at. And there are lots of great gadgets too!The characters are the best in a 007 movie. James Bond is charming and womanizer as ever, Pussy Galore is stunning and so Jill Masterson. And the villains, Goldfinger and henchman Oddjob are top-notch, and Goldfinger is bizarre because he is obsessed with gold objects.I liked in particular the gadgets, like Oddjob's hat that cuts everything, and liked also Shirley Eaton's silver death, the fight between Bond and Oddjob, and Goldfinger's death (sucked from a plane!!).And the acting is great. Sean Connery is great as always, Honor Blackman and Shirley Eaton are very SEXY and perfect for their roles, and Gert Frobe is a perfect villain!In the end, a masterpiece and one of the best movies ever in the James Bond franchise!",Goldfinger

154,RonellSowes,The Gold Standard Of Bond Films,10,26 December 2020,"Coming off the success of Dr No and From Russia With Love it seems hard to imagine how to continue that level of quality for a third time-somehow Goldfinger managed to do so. Many consider Goldfinger to be the best of the Bonds and while there is a compelling argument to be made,Goldfinger was a variation on the more serious,grounded previous films(From Russia With Love In Particular). But Goldfinger set a new standard and has served as an exemplar for James Bond films ever since.Sean Connery was still in his prime when he did this film complete with his suavness and bearing that made the character of James Bond what it is. When you have a hero as excellent as Bond you need a good villain(s) and Gert Fröbe and Harold Sakata were two of the best,in there own separate ways. After initial choice,Orson Welles,(who would have been fantastic in the part) demanded to much money the producers settled for the more budgetary and rather unknown Gert Fröbe as Auric Goldfinger. Fröbe pulled off the role beautifully blending all aspects of the character authentically;being sinister and contemptible yet not devoid of his own unique charm. And while Goldfinger is the main villain of the picture he is mostly the mind behind it all and his enforcer is is Oddjob. Oddjob is a mute so the performance relies exclusively on physical talent and former Olympian Harold Sakata couldn't have been more cut out for the role. Nearly every Bond villain mastermind since has had a silent,inhumanely strong henchman but none have ever lived up to the standard set by Sakata as Oddjob.The only real major flaw in this film is Goldfinger's plan and the ending. While not as farcical as others,Goldfinger's plot is fairly farfetched and planes dropping gas on Fort Knox is just a little too hokey. But it gives you the climax of:Bond trapped in a vault in Fort Knox,chained to a small nuclear weapon with Oddjob there to stop him and a battle raging outside. And just because there are some parts that are implausible,doesn't change the fact that on the whole the picture is pretty sensible-solving all problems with a logical answer.
While the script's plot may have some flaws the dialouge is nearly devoid of any. It has some of the wittiest,funniest and clever lines in a Bond film(and most other movies). The majority of which being delivered by Connery.
Another feature of this film that adds to its quality is John Barry's score. Even in some scenes in which you might not notice it immediately,its ever present and creates a whole new dimension to each scene.On a budget of 3 million Goldfinger grossed a total of about 126(a little over a billion in today's dollars). It was also the first Bond film to win an Oscar,it has been included on the AFI Thrills and BFI lists and remains a classic to this day.",Goldfinger
155,mikayakatnt,Height of the James Bond Movies,10,20 February 2020,"This is Sean Connery's pinnacle of the portrayal of James Bond.Auric Goldfinger is a classic James Bond villain who can only be surpassed by Mr. Blofeld. Oddjob was a truly scary villain as well. The villain's plan and the plot were well devised and not idiotic.The movie moves slowly by today's standard but not too slow. The movie itself has aged well except for those car chase scenes. The golden dead girl on the bed scene is one of the most memorable scenes in movie history.Also, did enjoy the strict adherence to the original book. That also deserves kudos.5/5. Sean Connery's top performance as James Bond. Hands down.",Goldfinger
156,perfectbond,The definitive bond,8,17 November 2003,"Although Goldfinger isn't my favorite in the series, I can see why others esteem it so much, even Spielberg in Catch Me If You Can. In an almost total departure from the approach of From Russia With Love, Goldfinger introduces 'the formula' of the pre-credit sequence, souped- up cars, gadgets, ridiculous stunts, peculiar henchmen, and over-the-top megalomanical villains (The girls were always there). The theme song is the most memorable in the series. In this episode the formula works because the elements are so fresh but in later installments it appears fatigued. Goldfinger, a masterpiece of pure entertainment: 9/10.",Goldfinger
157,elvircorhodzic,"""...this is gold, Mr. Bond. All my life I've been in love with its color...""",9,1 August 2017,"GOLDFINGER is an action thriller, the third in the James Bond series, in which the secret agent 007 tries to stop a crazy and rich tycoon in his intention to set up a radioactive bomb inside Fort Knox. It is based on the novel of the same name by Ian Fleming.The producers have refreshed and enriched a concept with excellent plots and cruel villain. Mr. Bond is surrounded, through a new concept, with a high-powered car and tricky gadgets. Of course, beautiful women circle around our charming agent. However, unlike the first two films, exotic, luxury and lustful games are reduced to a reasonable level. All this has changed the character of the main hero. Mr. Bond is more convincing and more serious in this film.The pace and direction is in the hands of villains. Mr. Bond is somewhat at a disadvantage. His charm and seductive skills do not affect a pilot who has an interesting name. However, we know that he will save, on a heroic way, with a little luck, this situation at the end, however, his position is not promising. The tension has a new dimension in the James Bond series. Therefore, this film offers more action and adventure compared to an exotic melodrama and love farce.Sean Connery as James Bond is a charming and cool hero. He tries to ""pull the brakes"" when it comes to women, which further enhances his charming performance and occasional jokes. However, sharing love with attractive blondes in exotic places is stronger than him.Gert Fröbe as Auric Goldfinger is a brutal psychopath who seems to have all the trump cards in their hands. He is a villain, who is ready for anything at any time. Mr. Fröbe has offered a good and convincing performance.Their support are Honor Blackman (Pussy Galore) as a frigid and capable Goldfinger's personal pilot and leader of an all-female team of pilots known as Pussy Galore's Flying Circus. Pussy will succeed to resist the charm of secret agent 007. Well, at least for a while. Harold Sakata as Oddjob is a sinister as a Goldfinger's lethal Korean manservant. His specific movement and a method of killing are very interesting. Shirley Eaton as Jill Masterson it a pleasant sight for sore eyes. Too bad she has quickly ""painted"" out.",Goldfinger
158,ofpsmith,The classic 007.,9,7 September 2015,"This is what people think of when they think James Bond. It has all the ingredients. Sean Connery, Aston Martin, evil villain, pretty girls, and the weapon that will kill everybody. Yes. Goldfinger is arguably the most famous James Bond movie. James Bond (Connery) is investigating millionaire Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) and his plans to steal the US Treasury's supply of gold from Fort Knox. The scene when Bond asks: ""You expect me to talk?"" and then Goldfinger replies: ""No Mr. Bond. I expect you to die!"" has gone down as one of the most famous movie lines of all time. The Aston Martin DB5 has also gone down in history as one of the most famous movie cars ever. I'll end the review here by saying, Dr. No pioneered the Bond films, but Goldfinger perfected them.",Goldfinger
159,davyd-02237,Not Villainy enough!,5,14 March 2020,"The main weakness of this enjoyable Bond Film is the villains. Goldfinger in the form of Gert Frobe is very weak. Whilst Harold Sakada made for a really good Oddjob, this entire film needs a modern upgrade with someone who can pass as a vulgar murderous villain. Frobe does not have the charisma - given how many he kills to get to his ""grand slam"" he hasn't got what it takes to be a vile villain. Equally, for the female villain (honor blackman) to simply foil Goldfingers master plan simply cos she had a romp in the barn with Bond is most unlikely. Very watchable with some decent action but the ending comes too quick and is disappointing. I for one hope in due time this one is remade with a cast which is equal to the task of drawing you into their murky world. Bond fans will love this but there are much better ones as the series has progressed and it certainly isn't as good as ""From Russia"" which was one of the predecessors",Goldfinger
160,Prichards12345,Classic Bond movie. Great Fun!,9,4 April 2017,"I still think Goldfinger and From Russia are the best Bond movies. Connery at the top of his game here. This is a spoofier movie than the first two Bonds, but it works superbly. Great villain in Gert Frobe's Auric Goldfinger, and the best Henchman in all the Bond films in the guise of Oddjob.This is the film that really took off at the box office and launched Bond as the only serious rival to the Beatles in the 60's mania stakes. It was one of the most successful movies of all time on release, and Thunderball would excel even that performance the following year. Our story of course concerns Bond out to discover what Operation Grandslam is all about. It's great fun.Honor Blackman is one of the most memorable Bond girls. ""I must be dreaming"" is a classic Bond line.It's a shame in a way that Goldfinger proved the template for 70s Bond, films vastly inferior to this one. I can take Bond with a rubber duck camouflage hat; submarine cars not so much...",Goldfinger
161,Hayden-86055,One of the finest Bond films,10,8 February 2021,"Goldfinger certainly deserves its reputation as one of the greatest British films. Sean Connery really comes into his own in his 3rd instalment as Bond and the budget is evidently bigger than previously. It's also by far the most original of Connery's films with Dr No being rather bland (good but we've seen it all before) and From Russia with Love was critiqued as being a copy of North by Northwest, or at least taking too much inspiration from it.The villains in the form of Goldfinger, Pussy Galore (subtle?) and Oddjob are very interesting and not just carbon cutouts, Goldfinger is a supervillain but he has style and a sense of humour. And he poses an actual threat.This is where Bond really comes into his own for the first time, we have the gadgets, the girls, the locations and the action. It's all fantastic stuff.10/10: If you're a Bond fan you absolutely must watch this!",Goldfinger
162,Mightyzebra,My third and THE third film of the JAMES BOND legacy,6,17 April 2009,"I was very disappointed with this James Bond and so far (I have watched the first five James Bonds) it is my least favourite. I found there was a certain (uncomfortable) atmosphere about it different from any of the Bond films I have watched. Other things I did not like about it were the fact that all the good women died and James Bond was left with a b**** who was originally James' enemy! Also the villain Goldfinger does not really seem to demonstrate how evil he is, unlike many of the people in the villain organization Spectre. Furthermore the film was too slow and even the fight scenes seemed either slow or uninspiring.The main thing I did like about this James Bond was the performance of Sean Connery as James Bond himself. I feel we really came to know his character and his personal feelings to things in this film. His performance in the last two films, ""Dr.No"" and ""From Russia With Love,"" were good as well, but I felt in ""Goldfinger"" he shone more. Oh - and the song ""Goldfinger"" is fantastic! :-) I recommend this Bond to people who enjoy the slower, more scheming fights and to people who love Sean Connery as BOND. Enjoy ""Goldfinger""! :-)",Goldfinger
163,qormi,Extremely Overrated,2,26 January 2012,"Goldfinger may be the signature Bond film to many, but in reality it was one of the most ridiculous, implausible, and insipid of the lot. A woman dies from being painted gold, which is impossible. Goldfinger's all-blonde, all-lesbian pilots violate the airspace of a United States military base, crop dusting death from their Cessnas and they're not shot down by a squadron of F-100's. They gas all the soldiers in Fort Knox, who, in turn; are not really gassed because they are faking it. James Bond is held captive for what appears to be half the film. Cheesy battle between members of the armed forces and a group of Chinese criminals recruited by Mr. Goldfinger. Bond practically raped the head lesbian, she turns straight, and betrays all the other lesbians. Bond forces a girl to pull over in her Mustang by slashing her tires with his blade-equipped wheels on his tricked-out Aston Martin. He nearly kills her in the process, much like Messalah did in the chariot race in Ben Hur. The whole plot is silly and the movie is ultimately too dumb. Opening sequence was cool, the Aston Martin tooling around in the Alps was cool, and the theme song was incredible. Other than that, it sucked. And the fat Japanese dude with the metal frisbee derby hat? Very dumb. A heavy metal derby hat is not aerodynamically designed to float like a frisbee.",Goldfinger
164,Marwan-Bob,Best of the Connery era by far,8,22 December 2019,"One of the best in the Bond enterprise, 'Goldfinger' delights with its action sequences, storyline, and actors.

165,timdalton007,The Film That Changed Bond Forever,9,2 April 2011,"1964 was when the Bond films went from a rising film series to a worldwide phenomenon. What made that possible was Goldfinger. In a way, it continued on from the two films that proceeded it and yet a departure from them as well with its introduction of over the top characters, action packed pre-credit sequence, high profile gadgetry and larger then life (possibly even outlandish) plot. While this is the film that changed Bond forever is it the greatest?Leading that effort is Sean Connery's Bond. From the moment he emerges out of the water in the pre-credit sequence right up to the very last scene, Connery owns every single scene he's in. Connery even gets some good acting moments as well such as Bond's near outburst at M or Bond's quite desperation during the film's famous laser beam scene.. Connery also has great chemistry with his various female co-stars as well, all important thanks to the plot. This Bond isn't quite the rough and tumble character seen in either previous film thanks to a greater emphasis on humor but Connery serves the character and the film well.Gert Fröbe's Goldfinger changed the role of the Bond villain. While previous villains were physical as well as intellectual matches for Bond for the most part, Goldfinger was the first one that was purely the latter. Fröbe, dubbed by actor Michael Collins, gives an effective performance as the seemingly mild mannered businessman who is far more then what he seems. While not the best villain of the series, Fröbe's Golfinger remains for the most part effective nevertheless.Perhaps more effective and making the larger impact is Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore. That fact is no small feat considering that the character doesn't appear until around half way through. It helps that Blackman was somewhat older then the girls of the previous films which gives the character a sense of believability, especially when it comes to her chemistry with Connery's Bond. That chemistry helps to make a plot point late in the film believable if only just. Overall, Blackman makes the most of every second of the screen-time she has.The supporting cast of the film does good as well. Of special note is the short but famous appearance made by actress Shirley Eaton as Jill Masterson in the Miami portion of the film. Also making a large impact both in the film and on future henchmen is Harold Sakata as Oddjob who remains a menacing presence throughout, even if only using a shadow to do so. Rounding out the supporting cast are Tania Mallet as Tilly, Cec Linder as Felix Leiter, Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny and of course Bernard Lee as M. And of course, Goldfinger is notable for making Desmond Llewelyn's Q a character whose presence would be looked forward to in every Bond film that followed thanks to Llewelyn's playing of the friendly antagonism between Q and 007. As a result, it's pretty well cast all around.The production values of the film are strong as well. Ken Adams return as production designer gives the entire film a larger then life sense from Miami hotel rooms to Q's lab, Goldfinger's rumpus room and of course the incredible (if incredibly unrealistic) interior of Fort Knox. Peter Hunt's editing keeps the film moving at a pace starting with the fast paced pre-credits sequence. Ted Moore's camera work once again serves the film well, especially during the scenes of the Aston Martin DB5 driving along in Switzerland or in revealing the scope of Adams Fort Knox set for the finale. The effects work is the only real downside to the production values thanks to some dodgy model shots with some all too visible wires. That said, the physical effects are superb such as the various pieces of DB5 gadgetry. The result is satisfying all around.Goldfinger though would be less effective without John Barry's fantastic score. The entire score is a showcase from the use of the James Bond theme in the pre-credits sequence to the stings used for Oddjob's appearances to the suspenseful underscoring of the laser beam sequence and the bombastic, yet suspenseful, underscoring of the climatic raid on Fort Knox. Not forgetting the opening titles song performed by Shirley Bassey which, combined with the opening credits that plays highlights of the film over a gold painted woman, sets up the film that is to follow. In fact, Barry set the standard by which future Bond scores would be judged.Which brings us to the two things that sets Goldfinger apart from its predecessors: director Guy Hamilton and its script. Both the direction and the script present a different take of the Bond world with emphasis on the more visual and larger then life aspects. This includes the introduction or greater emphasis placed on many of the aspects that have been discussed all ready. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. Viewing just this Goldfinger, those elements work splendidly in creating a suspenseful yet at times humorous adventure film. Yet the effect on the series as whole would only become apparent in the years to come as the filmmakers tried to replicate the successful formula of this film to the point of becoming heavily clichéd, if not self-parodying at times. Yet the work of both the director and the screenwriters serve this particular film very well.While Goldfinger isn't the greatest Bond film, it certainly has plenty to offer. From Connery's Bond to Gert Fröbe and Honor Blackman's larger then life character's to the supporting cast, the acting is good. The production values are fantastic as well from the sets to John Barry's score if one is willing to look past some occasionally dodgy effects work. Yet Goldfinger's introduction of certain aspects to the Bond films changed the series for both better and worse. So what can really be said about Goldfinger then is this: it changed Bond forever.",Goldfinger
166,jucsetmai,Goldfinger on 4k ultra hd,9,27 February 2021,"I watched a few of the 4K ones on iTunes (TMWTGG, TSWLM and OHMSS) and I can honestly say I did not really see any improvement over my Blu-rays. I do not think the iTunes 4K have HDR/DV either and the audio is AAC/AC3 5.1 not DTS-HD MA. I know Lowry rescanned a bunch of the old movies and I would assume they scanned everything at 4K. So I have to wonder how much improved a 4K set would be over just the plain Blu-rays. The only Blu-ray I was never happy with was GoldenEye because it looks DNR'd to death and I've heard that the 4K iTunes ones does not suffer from this.

167,Bogmeister,BOND#3: an Odd Obsession With Gold,9,14 May 2007,"MASTER PLAN: use a dirty bomb to irradiate Fort Knox, thereby increasing one's personal wealth of gold. How good is the film ""Goldfinger?"" Enough that nearly every Bond film after this copied the formula - but none could, of course, completely match it. The now-requisite action teaser was itself imitated by James Cameron for his parody ""True Lies"" 30 years later. It's a great showcase for Bond's 'infiltrate & destroy' abilities, complete with a fun fight scene and deadly pun thrown in. This also had the first song sung over the credits, by Shirley Bassey - probably the best of the series, as well. The first post-credits sequence is in a spectacular version of Miami, where Bond seems to be vacationing. However, though apparently off duty, he has his first run in with the villain of the title and his 2nd meet with CIA liaison Leiter (a different actor from ""Dr.No's"" Leiter, as would usually be the case in the series). This entire portion has a relaxed quality, almost whimsical, but ends on a pretty grim note; that famous shot of the girl on the bed after Bond regains consciousness still sends chills down my spine, even after seeing it numerous times. The filmmakers remind a relaxed audience: hey, this is Bond's world; it's weird, it's scary; it's surely fantastic. Don't let your guard down.Where as Connery was the new breed in ""Dr.No"" and the consummate professional solidifying his status in ""From Russia From Love,"" here he is already the familiar superstar, possibly the greatest star of the sixties at this point. His Bond is by now ingrained in the public's perceptions and can do no wrong. But, he's still a coiled spring, a waiting tiger, certainly not sleepwalking through an old role. When he's close to death, as does expectedly happen a few times during the course of this adventure, we still tense up, thanks to his performance. He does have some new toys to play with in this one, moving the Bond thriller away from the strict espionage tactics of the previous film. After the (extended) meeting with M, here is the prototypical instruction scene with Q, where he introduces Bond to his new, fully-equipped auto. This set the standard for the rest of the Bonders, but still outshines them all. And, check out the tour of the testing facility (we had a tour of SPECTRE's digs, a similar layout, in the previous film). The title villain follows Dr.No as the latest wealthy megalomaniac, but here he's much more colorful and deals with Bond throughout most of the film, unlike Dr.No's late appearance in the earlier film. And there's Oddjob, the brutish henchman; he has also never been equaled in terms of style and menace (Jaws came close in ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" over a dozen years later).Why has ""Goldfinger"" and its far-out elements never been surpassed? Well, how can it be? How do you top someone like Oddjob, that living brick of a thug and his hat? How do you outdo the ingenious yet simple plan against America's gold reserve, a combo of elegance and sheer audacity that must have sprung from the mind of the world's biggest egoist? How do you better a name such as Pussy Galore? It's all here: the larger-than-life villain; the unbeatable henchman; the classic femme fatale - she's depicted as Bond's equal, rather than as another Bond girl. The actress, Blackman, was not a simple young thing, like most of the Bond girls. There are also several classic scenes, now embedded in the minds of fans everywhere: the laser beam threatening Bond where it really hurts and Goldfinger's classic line come to mind, besides the one already mentioned with the girl on the bed. Everything came together splendidly in this one, including Bond's climactic battle with Oddjob (how do you beat an unbeatable foe?) and the main villain's final scene. Obviously, much of this par excellence is due to the source material - Ian Fleming's novel. On the downside, this started the trend to basically remake this with each new Bond film, but it can't take anything away from this one. Bond would return in ""Thunderball.""

There's a myriad selection of pistols that can hold in excess of 15 rounds in a pistol magazine ie. the Browning Hi-Power (1935) can carry 15rounds as standard/unmodified.In another scene, 007 gets shot with a tranquilizer dart and IMMEDIATELY falls asleep. This is a known fallacy and no tranquilizer can paralyze (or knock out) a target in less than 30seconds, since it takes time for the tranquilizing agent to enter the bloodstream and reach the brain (yup, it has to reach your brain, not your heart/lungs like some people may assume).And let's not even talk about the 'gas' they use as a plot device in the movie... that is the biggest plot hole by far, as it's LITERALLY impossible for any gas to do what they showed in the movie.They for some reason like to speed up the footage in certain scenes. I noticed at least 3 scenes where they sped up the footage by at least 2x for seemingly no reason at all. It's really strange.Overall, it's an OK 007 action flick, but sub-par even for 1964 especially considering how unrealistic and impossible the plot-devices are that they use.",Goldfinger
170,LebowskiT1000,Much better with multiple viewings.,8,8 February 2003,"I don't know why, but the first time I watched this some years ago, I didn't think it was all that good.  Perhaps it was because I was somewhat young and had only seen some of the newest James Bond films.  But I recently obtained the DVD of the film and watched it again and found it to be much better than I remembered.The story is surprisingly smart and well written, and the pacing is very good, there aren't any long boring stretches of story.  The action is well placed, and very fun to watch.  Sure this film has it's flaws, like any other, but it's a good, fun movie.The cast is great, Sean Connery plays James Bond of course and very well I might add.  Gert Frobe plays the infamous ""Goldfinger"" very well, being quite ingenious and devious.  The women of the film are very nice to look at, as usual.  The rest of the cast was great as well.  I must admit that I really enjoyed the chemistry (despite being a short scene) between James Bond and Q.  Desmond Llewelyn expands his character, Q, from the previous Bond film: ""From Russia With Love"", very nicely.  Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell both return to their respective roles, and pulling off great performances.  Harold Sakata plays the notorious henchman ""Oddjob"", very nicely as well.Another great reason to watch this film is to point out all the connections to the Austin Powers series, there are a lot so pay close attention for them...if you like or have seen the Austin Powers series that is.In comparison to the earlier Bond films, as much as I didn't want to say this before having watched it the second and third time, this film is probably better than both ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia With Love"".  While they were both excellent films, this film seems to have a more interesting plot and just all around better done.  So, if you like any of the other James Bond films, you should definitely give this one a chance.  Just keep one thing in mind, this film was made back in 1964, so treat it like one.  I hope that you will enjoy the film.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Goldfinger
171,nicholls_les,One of the best Connery Bond Films,8,26 November 2015,"Such a great film in it's time. It was the first Bond film to appeal to teenage boys because of it's almost comic book look, the cars and of course the gadgets.Auric Goldfinger is a great Bond villain and the laser scene one of the most memorable in film history. 'Do you want me to talk?' 'No Mr Bond, I want you to die' - Pure genius that is.The Bond girls are all good and Honor Blackman looks amazing as Pussy Galore. Even though she was 38 she looks as good as any of her co stars.The only downside to the film was that the end was something of an anti-climax, apart from the fight with Odd Job.However definitely one of COnnery's best Bond films.",Goldfinger
172,grendelkhan,Probably the single most memorable villain in the series!,8,26 November 2012,"Goldfinger is the apex of the Connery Bond films. The elements kept building as the series progressed, with FRWL one-upping Dr. No with greater scope and intrigue, and Goldfinger topping that with an even bigger villain. The series was now an institution and the public had high expectations of glorious stunts, memorable scenes, quick with, and the most beautiful leading ladies in film.Goldfinger launches things with a somewhat lackluster teaser, compared to the previous film and subsequent ones. Bond infiltrates a drug operation, via a scuba insertion (with tux ready underneath) and proceeds to quickly destroy it. He then takes a breather at a club, for a bit of relaxation and electrocution. Bond follows this up with a nice breather, though he finds himself embroiled in the crooked card game perpetuated by one Auric Goldfinger. Bond trips him up, but pays a price as we find his accomplice and lover painted gold and murdered. Bond is next pulled into a rather mundane mission revolving around gold smuggling, but gives it his all as he learns the target is Goldfinger. A game of golf brings our adversaries together again and the continue to cross paths as they journey to the big score: an attack on Fort Knox! The film introduces us to one of the most memorable villains in Goldfinger, played by German actor Gert Froebe (while dubbed) and the henchmen di tutti henchmen Oddjob (played by wrestler Harold Sakata). Goldfinger is the measuring stick for all megalomaniac's to follow. He is neither an agent of SPECTRE or the USSR, he is a villain of his own creation. Oddjob is pure thug, lacking in Red Gran't measured attacks, but making up for it in brutality. Oddjob would become a symbol for henchmen and would be copied and parodied endlessly.The gadgets we have come to expect really come to the fore here. Where Dr. No just gave us the Walther PPK and FRWL added the fantastic, but believable attaché case, Goldfinger gives us the Aston Martin DB5, with the most amazing optional extras to be found. We have machine guns (for clearing traffic jams, no doubt), oil slick dispensers, rotating license plates, a tracking system, and an ejector seat (no, we are not joking...). Strangely, Q forgot the cuplholder.Connery is really in the groove here and he is matched by the rest of the cast. Froebe is charming and menacing, while Sakata radiates danger. Honor Blackman leaves Steed to fend for himself, and enters our world as Pussy Galore, who proves to be not as immune to Bond's charms as she believes.The set pieces are memorable, from the golden ""sacrificial lamb"" to the laser torture sequence, to the battle for Ft. Knox and Bond's fight with Oddjob. The scenery isn't quite as exotic as last time, but it is varied, with Mexico, English golf courses, the Swiss Alps, and the southern US. And, just when you think everything is finished, we get a surprise attack at the end. All in all, one of the most memorable entries in the series.",Goldfinger
173,StanleyStrangelove,The best Bond film,10,1 June 2004,"This is the best Bond film, and a very good movie in any genre. Gert Frobe is the perfect arch-villain; not campy or played over-the-top as so many other Bond villains have been portrayed. Connery is at his best and seems comfortable and happy to be in the role. Honor Blackman is a very sexy Bond woman who can also act and carries her own in the film. Odd Job verges on the comic-book villain, but is an amusing and believable heavy and his fight with Bond is electrifying. The plot is suitably bizarre and almost believable. The Bond and Goldfinger golf course scene is great. The finale is the best in the series. The car chases and Bond gadgets are still believable and the special effects extravaganzas of the later Bond movies don't overpower the movie. The music is John Barry 1960's with the trademark twangy-guitar theme and the movie theme song isn't lame like most of the rest were. Along with this Bond film, the others to see are Dr. No and From Russia With Love. Avoid the Roger Moore series and also the one Lazenby film. I've recently been watching all the Bond films again and except for the two mentioned, they just don't compare to this one.",Goldfinger
174,andrewroy-04316,"No different than its predecessors, Goldfinger is another fine action movie with no shortage of ridiculousness and women as objects",6,2 September 2020,"Goldfinger is a solid example of the early Bond movies - a decent villain, but a plot with little substance that relies heavily on hand-to-hand action sequences and Bond seducing women constantly. Goldfinger has a fully coherent plot (more so than From Russia With Love), and my favorite villain yet. It drags a bit less, and on the whole I can agree that it's the best of the first three. It still is in the same category as the previous two, though - fine movies that just don't have much substance to engage with. The way women are constantly treated as objects for Bond to seduce and protect is extremely tiresome, and the fact that there's a nonconsensual kissing scene made it even more upsetting here. The entire plot and Bond's success rests on convincing Pussy (what a silly name choice) to see his side of it, despite a single paper thin scene of him pleading. The climactic action scene with the admittedly cool henchman with the steel hat was shockingly bad - one of the better parts of From Russia With Love was the solid climactic action scene, but here it couldn't be less convincing, with Bond throwing himself across the ground and hitting the wall with no force. I did like the callback to the opening scene of the movie with the electric shock, though. It's not a bad movie, it's just so mediocre and forgettable that it is truly odd to me how iconic Bond as a figure is, especially if this is the peak of Bond films.",Goldfinger

176,TheMan3051,Thirds a Charm,10,4 February 2002,"What is it about James Bond that is so appealing to teenage boys and men? Is it the gadgets? Or maybe the Women? Or maybe the amazing adventures full of excitement and delight? Whatever the reason, the formula was best used in `Goldfinger.'`Goldfinger', which is the third Bond adventure, completes the Bond formula that was in development during `Dr. No' and `From Russia with Love'. In this film directed by Guy Hamilton (taking over for Terence Young) Bond (Sean Connery) is send in a mission to stop Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) from completing his `Operation Grand Slam' which involves the break in into Fort Knox which would make him the richest man in the world.Along the way he meets his newest Bond Girl, Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman) and Goldfinger`s sidekick Odd job. The film overall is the greatest in the series so far and Connery plays Bond at near perfection proving that he is the greatest Bond of them all.This is the film that set the standard for which all Bonds would follow and like its predecessors the film had its chair of gadgets. The most famous gadget in the film which is probably the most famous in the series is the Aston Martin DB5, which featured a reclining license plate, a tracking device, a water hose, and among others that blew audiences off their seat. Many actually believe this to be the greatest Bond car of them all, but I think it's all in the use. For instance the Aston Martin is useful to perform pranks on friends by water hosing them, if the next seat passenger is annoying then you can just press the little red button and throw them out of the car, now if you cheated on your girlfriend then the BMW from `Tomorrow Never Dies' would be your choice, since the car is unbreakable and can electrify you then no p***ed off girlfriend can mess around with your car, now if you want to go to Cuba and take care of some personal business then the car from `The Spy Who Loved Me' is the best car to use as you run free through water. Finally, while your girlfriend is trying to break your car and you're not taking care of personal business, then you can just cruise around the streets in your Aston Martin DB5.",Goldfinger

Sean Connery returns as James Bond 007 to stop the evil Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) and his henchman (Harold Sakata) destroy all the gold in Fort Knox. The film contains the action (the pre-credit sequence, finale), the girls (Pussy Galore, played by Honor Blackman) and the gadgets (Aston Martin). ""Do you expect me to talk?"" Who hasn't heard of the famous line said by Goldfinger to Bond? The film had huge detailed set pieces with the most amazing set being Fort Knox. The action which takes place within is exciting and gripping. It might be the James Bond/Oddjob fight or the race around in the Aston Martin, there is surely going to be a scene here for everyone. Shirley Bassey's powerful Goldfinger theme music is belted out. Even to today, the theme tune is still seen as one of the best theme tunes.Originally seen as the best, but now one of the best (along with Casino Royale).

178,jhaggardjr,The best of 007!,10,7 November 2000,"Of the nineteen James Bond movies that have been made so far, ""Goldfinger"" is easily the best 007 film. It has everything. Great villains, great women, great action, great humor, and the best Bond of them all, Sean Connery. In ""Goldfinger"", James Bond faces off against the title character, a man obsessed with gold who is planning a major heist by breaking into Fort Knox. Gert Frobe, who plays Goldfinger, just might be the best Bond villain to date. Harold Sakata, who plays Goldfinger's mute henceman Oddjob, is every bit as good as Frobe. These two villains are definitely in the classic tradition of the 007 series. Honor Blackman is also excellent as the lead Bond woman, the no-nonsense Pussy Galore. And of course Connery is outstanding as usual in the role that made him famous. The action scenes are spectacular with excitement for start to finish. With a thrilling music score by John Barry and a smashing title song sung by Shirley Bassey, ""Goldfinger"" is the James Bond film that is absolutely perfect. None of the other films in the series are as perfect as this one. This is the best of 007!**** (out of four)",Goldfinger
179,dfle3,Sean Connery shines as Bond. The first great movie. 85/100,8,2 July 2010,"In his 3rd outing as super spy James Bond, Sean Connery gives his finest performance in this role. He's suave in this movie in a way that he wasn't before...especially compared to the debut of this franchise (""Dr.No""). Never before has he been this likable...you just want to be with him...or better yet, be him! (hmmm...that's if you are a bloke).There are times in this movie when his attempts at bon mots or interaction with women aren't his high points, but they are buried under the rest of his charismatic performance.When I first saw this movie a month or so back, I was looking at scoring it around 8/10. Having watched it again the other day, I have to say how pleasurable it still was...the lovely chemistry between Connery and Honor Blackman, and just the winning persona of Connery as Bond in this movie. The first two Bond movie don't really have that 'repeat' viewing quality. For me, this is ultimate Connery as Bond movie. The plot is simple and Goldfinger's personal assistant is one of the most memorable henchman in the franchise...more memorable than some of the principle villains in the past or future movies.The setting:The U.S.A. (Miami, Kentucky); Geneva.The plot: Seemingly legit businessman Auric Goldfinger is suspected by Bond's organisation (MI5) of being a gold smuggler, so James is assigned to find out how Goldfinger is managing to smuggle gold undetected. Just by the by, you do get a nice snapshot of the business of gold early on in the movie...the world's changed since then...the British currency no longer is supported by the value of Britain's gold reserves. As for Goldfinger's actual scheme...it's wonderfully ambivalent...initially I just found it totally absurd, yet it does have its own diabolical logic which makes it insanely sensible! Looking at the end credits, it seems that the scenes supposedly shot in the US were done at Pinewood studios, in England...the studio made famous by the Bond movies. With this bit of information, it sort of makes sense now why the Americans didn't really sound convincing to me...but maybe they are real American actors, and not British impersonators.This is the first Bond movie to 'tick all the boxes' as far as the franchise formula is concerned: Pre-title sequence: Yes. You get the iconic gun barrel graphic, theme music and gunshot. Then the pre-theme sequence which now appears for the 2nd time, after the first movie did not feature it.Movie title theme: Yes. The first Bond movie where the theme song is at the start. And this is the first classic too...by Shirley Bassey, of course. Surely the greatest exponent of this formula. The lyrics pretty much give you the back story to Auric Goldfinger! Sexism: Yes. Bond comes off as patronising a couple of times in his dealings with women...by what he says (""Man talk"") or a slap on the bum. This is a minor quibble, as he does come across as cooler other times, even when he isn't being the perfect gentlemen to some of the female characters.Silly female character names: Yes. You get the impression that ""Dink"" is a rather lame attempt at this formula, but gosh, you ain't seen nothing yet! One of the male characters has a rather odd name...literally. Both of these names gets 'satirised' in one of the Austin Powers movies.Wine snobbery: Yes. Thank God that even M has gotten sick of this trait by now! (he describes one of Bond's digressions as a ""lecture""...bravo M!).Q: Yes. Second time in a movie, after the debut movie didn't have it. A fixture now.End credits teaser: Yes.Things to look out for: Famous last words by Bond: He makes a gratuitous comment about The Beatles, which had by then taken the world by storm...note how it combines old world taste in music with Bond's signature snobbery!...not often you hear the phrase ""The Beatles"" and ""earmuffs"" in the same sentence!""My dear girl, there are some things that just aren't done, such as drinking Dom Perignon '53 above the temperature of 38 degrees Fahrenheit. That's just as bad as listening to the Beatles without earmuffs!"" 008 - This might be the first mention of other ""00"" spies...and that they may be better for some assignments than Bond is...as M lets him know, not too subtly.Bond's prowess - Not sure, but maybe the principle female character in this movie is supposed to be a lesbian...it seems to be hinted at, obliquely. Bedding her would surely cement the Bond legend, right? S.P.E.C.T.R.E. - you can't look at them. It's not featured in this movie...which might actually be why I like it so much.The end credits mention a technical adviser called ""Russhon""...which is a name that appears in the movie...on a sign near Fort Knox. Speaking of which...how is accurate is the representation of Fort Knox?",Goldfinger
180,Al_The_Strange,It's golden,9,18 March 2015,"James Bond: he's the man, and for his first couple of films it seemed like filmmakers had the Midas touch. In his third cinema adventure, the superspy's heroics and stakes are far bigger and more fantastic, and it adds up to one of the most escapist spy movies ever made.From start to finish, the film's pace is brisk, and it doesn't hold back. In one movie, Bond uses every ounce of resourcefulness, wit, and brawn against his adversaries. There is plenty of action, all really fast-paced and well-staged, if not really over-the-top and zany. Bond drives a car loaded with a ridiculous number of gadgets: machine guns, a smoke screen, radar, rotating license plates, an ejector seat, and a little thingy that comes out of the wheel to jack up other cars. These are cool scenes that pushed the Aston Martin DB5 into legendary status. When he isn't driving around, Bond fights bad guys with just about everything he can - guns, fists, and things in the environment. Among these fights, he takes on a Korean dude who seems invincible, and throws a lethal metal hat that can slice through solid stone. To help him, Bond makes allies with quite a few lovely ladies, one of whom is asphyxiated when she's covered head-to-toe in gold paint. At one point, Bond is tied to a slab with a laser beam creeping towards him; how does he get out of that? The whole movie is loaded with exciting and iconic scenes, and it breezes by smoothly and concisely. Each scene is really good, and there's never a dull moment.This story is as outlandish as they come, but the film carries no pretense. It is pure escapism, and the plot's absurdities play into the tone and style perfectly. The plot progresses smoothly, and a lot of conventions are introduced that carry over to future films (especially in regards to the sheer number of gadgets, action setpieces used). Bond is as cool as ever, while the villains carry a pretty decent presence and persona. However, all characters remain simple and one-dimensional.This film has very solid and interesting photography, and snappy editing. Sean Connery is still effective as Bond; Gert Fröbe straddles a line between playfulness and angst as Goldfinger, and it makes him fairly enjoyable to watch. I could always take or leave Honor Blackman - her character may have quite the distinctive name, but I found her character borderline unlikable. Other actors are alright. Writing is not bad. This production uses some very slick and colorful sets and costumes; some of the props seem really over-the-top (the insides of the nuclear bomb looks like a giant toy for some reason), and some of the special effects show their age. Shirley Bassey's theme song is a really strange and discordant song, but for some reason it's also really catchy, and it set the trend for future Bond theme songs. John Barry's score is very energetic, jazzy, and hip.What the film lacks in plot, it makes up for in action, energy, style, and sheer iconic status. It is one of the most essential titles in the series, and that makes it a must-see.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Very Good)",Goldfinger
181,JakeBrinkman,Utterly ridiculous,2,7 July 2019,"The characters and plot are just absurd. The movie doesn't dive too deeply into... well, anything. That makes it easier for the audience to miss quick sentences and actions that derail the plot or make the characters seem idiotic. The movie is essentially mindless action, and even the action lacks all believability.With that said, it's very clear to see how the Bond gadgets inspired decades of imagination. While Goldfinger's particular gadgets aren't entirely realistic, they do make one wonder what could happen if they were more realistic and used in a better grounded film.",Goldfinger

Surprisingly Cliche & Not Very Sexy.",5,23 April 2021,"I really enjoy the Bond films, so re-watching in order and rating these movies is one of the activities I most looked forward to when I decided to create this IMDB account. As a fan, I must say that this is an over-rated Bond film. The title is catchy - 'Goldfinger'. Titles matter. The next film, 'Thunderball' (1965) - terrible title. However, it turns out, 'Thunderball' (1965) is a much better film than 'Goldfinger' (1964).The biggest problem with 'Goldfinger' (1964) is Goldfinger, the character. Bond films are always filled with cliches, to the point that Bond films create cliches (see the animated show 'Archer' (2009)); however, Goldfinger is a list of cliches in one character. So, your villain in your third film is rich, huh? Ok. And, he's super smart... well, ok. What's that - he has a super-weapon, too? A big laser? Wow. Also, he has nuclear weapons. Really? Did he even need the super-laser? Not really... And, he has his own private army, too. *sigh* Cool.Personally, I think the worst thing about Goldfinger was that he travels around cheating old folks on cruise ships at gin rummy. What as *ssh*l*.Also, Pussy Galore, the top-billed 'Bond Girl' of the film? Yeah, not sexy.All things considered, this is a fine Bond installment with an overall weak plot, peppered with Sean Connery/James Bond performing unrealistic fight scenes with men and way-too-realistic abuse scenes with women.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

184,DavidSim240183,007's finest hour,10,26 May 2006,"I've seen every James Bond film. From Dr No to Die Another Day. Sean Connery was the best one to play the debonair secret agent with a cruel, sardonic streak. Dr No and From Russia With Love were both excellent adventures in their own right, and provided 007 with situations that would become trademarks, such as dastardly villains and beautiful women. And then came Goldfinger. The one where everything clicked into place.Goldfinger is often regarded as the best Bond adventure in the series. And it's not hard to see why. This is the film where Bond's style was becoming established. And unlike some of the later adventures, this is a tightly plotted action film with excellent direction that leads from one classic set piece to the next. A joy from start to finish.007 is pitted against Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe). A dealer in gold bullion, he is about to pull off the crime of the century by knocking off Fort Knox. But his aim is not to steal anything. But instead to plant an atomic bomb to irradiate the gold supply, so his own gold stock will skyrocket in value.Goldfinger's plan is quite brilliant when you think about it. What separates his masterplan from the other megalomaniacs Bond tangles with in the future is the fact that it sounds plausible. There's no reason really why it shouldn't work. The only thing Goldfinger didn't anticipate was Bond.The best way to describe why Goldfinger is so enjoyable is because it's so much fun. From the very first frame the film works wonders with Bond in a wetsuit stripping down to reveal a stylish tuxedo. Then comes 007's tryst with a sexy woman, only to be attacked by a hit-man. There's a stunning camera angle where the killer is reflected off the girl's eyeball. One marvels at how that was accomplished in 1964!Then comes the fight. Which leads to Bond throwing him into the bathtub. Followed by an electric fan. ""Shocking!"" In any other Bond film that quip would have sounded cheesy. But in Goldfinger, it works perfectly. Followed by the song Goldfinger, sung with great ebullience by Shirley Bassey.It's not long before the actual plot kicks in, and the classic moments come thick and fast. Jill Masterson painted in gold. Bond's golf game with Goldfinger. Oddjob. The introduction of the Aston Martin. Bond's playful banter with Q. The ill-fated Tilly Masterson (sister of Jill). A thrilling car chase. And finally...The most famous scene of all. Bond's near emasculation by laser beam. That's such a gripping scene because Goldfinger has Bond. There's no way he can get out of this one. No gadgets. No gimmicks. ""Do you expect me to talk?"" ""No Mr Bond. I expect you to die!"" He only escapes through sheer luck by overhearing Operation Grand-Slam. Even though he has no idea what that is. He was just grasping at straws. It's rare that 007 finds himself in such a tight spot.Then comes the Bond girl, Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman). Very risqué that is! Unlike some of the simpering, moronic bimbos that would populate the series in future (cough Tanya Roberts cough), Pussy is smart, feisty, and more than capable of holding her own against Bond.It's at this point the action slows down a little. This is only a minor chink. But it does lead up to one very contrived scene where Goldfinger holds a meeting with a gang of hoods and explains in detail what Operation Grand-Slam entails. It is a very pointless scene because it's only purpose is for Bond to find out what the plot is. Goldfinger kills them anyway so you wonder what was the point.But aside from that, Goldfinger is a flawless film. Because of the way it perfectly balances action and humour, whereas Roger Moore's tenure degenerated into campy ludicrousness, Goldfinger has become the classic it rightfully deserves to be. Then we get the wonderfully constructed Fort Knox. That must have cost Pinewood Studios a fortune. It is so huge, and seems real right down to the smallest detail. Then comes Bond's fight with Oddjob and his killer bowler hat. And a fantastic fight it is too. Bond's method of dispatching Oddjob is clever, and very unexpected. You assume it's the hat that will kill him. And it does. But not the way you think.And finally, Goldfinger's demise. And an odd death it is too. But he had it coming. Capped by the customary final explosion. And Pussy surrendering to Bond's charms. The perfect end to a perfect film. The delights are plentiful from every angle. Even the cute gag when the bomb's timer stops on 007.Goldfinger has never been surpassed by any of the others. It is sheer perfection. Some have come close from time to time. But this still remains the series finest hour.",Goldfinger

Finally with the plot it has a good amount of thrilling parts, with the beginning and end being that, with the middle of the plot sandwich being Bond figuring out what is going on, great stuff.Connery does well in the lead role again and firmly brings out what we want to see from Bond, and with his gadgets and such to help, Connery isn't left without any help in his third outing to entertain us. I liked the villain Auric Goldfinger but it has to be said most of his shots when he is being his ever evil self involve Oddjob his devout henchman who's hat throwing skills make his of the most memorable people from this film if not of any film in the Bond series. Honor Blackman as the Bond girl I didn't feel was massively good but she carries Bond along well and make a different Bond girl than most of them we see.The script was good and contributes highly to Connery's great one liners he dishes out al through the movie. I loved the gadgets involved and is one of the Bond's that is actually good with the use of gadgets, for example like his Aston Martin with the revolving license plate and it's great gun's + more, you can't ask for much more in that department. Finally technical wise, it feels very well done as a production and although some films around the time has shabby and dim lit sets, Bond's sets are great big ones and even one of the more humble Bond's.The film isn't without criticism, it has it's parts where it drags just a little, but to be fair to the film the good parts basically make up for the parts where it maybe slightly misses the mark. I also felt the story is kind of ridiculous and that although most critics and audience alike like the film, many I feel would have to admit that the story Is kind of far fetched for even a Bond Movie, can't damn it for it's wacky ideas though.Bond fans should fall in love with this and probably already are with stereotypical Bond all the way through this, and with ease. Those who enjoy the three genres Bond is, Action, Adventure and Crime will not displeased by this as it also represents them in a good way with the villain being a good criminal, Bond fights a lot and with that he goes to a lot of different places also.It is safely very good, I will disagree with those who think it is a GREAT film but nevertheless I can see why they feel that way about this. Connery really brings Bond to life here and with thrill and a suave personality that just makes you want to see them all, by far this is Connerys best and wouldn't be surprised if you thought this was THE best Bond film of the entire film series.",Goldfinger
186,majikstl,"""He loves gold. He loves only gold. Only gold.""",9,7 June 2006,"You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film and how GOLDFINGER rates on a scale of 1 to 10: Title: GOLDFINGER: Certainly a strange name for either a movie or a human being, yet it does bring together two concepts perfectly: Greed and phallic symbolism. 8 points.Pre-Credit Teaser: Bond blows something up, kisses a girl, kills a bad guy and delivers a one-liner. None of which are important to the ensuing story. 3 points.Opening Credits: Having used a woman's naked flesh as a screen for a slideshow of the opening credits in FROM RUSSlA WITH LOVE, Maurice Binder takes the next logical step and uses moving images this time. It's only afterward that it might dawn on you that the lady in question this time is a gilded corpse. Creepy. 7 points.Theme Song: As the prototypical Bond theme song, the incomparable Shirley Bassey empowers it with a sultry sensuality, even as the lyrics are about greed, betrayal and murder. The first Bond song to become a classic. 10 points.""Bond, James Bond"": I think this is the film where Sean Connery officially takes control of the character of James Bond and of the film series itself. You don't sense that he is playing a character, but the character is a part of him. Possibly the quintessential Bond performance. 10 points.Bond Babes: The notion that Bond Girls are rather disposable probably took root here. The ill-fated Masterson sisters, Jill and Tilly, come and go rather quickly, but Shirley Eaton's glittery death under a coat of gold paint is unforgettable -- and became a symbol for the series as a whole. However, despite her attention-getting name, Pussy Galore isn't really that interesting of a character. Though ex-Avenger Honor Blackman set a standard for lesbian chic, she seems to switch sides, so to speak, awfully quick. 7 points.Bond Villain: Auric Goldfinger is the perfect Bond villain: Gert Frobe plays him with childish arrogance, a tad of hamminess and a sense of humor. Bond would meet other self-made millionaire, out-to-control-the-world megalomaniacs in the decades to come, but none would stand out with such a distinctive flare. ""No, Mr. Bond, I expect to you die!"" Great line. 10 points.Bond Baddies: Okay, this is arguably where the Bond series begins to get a bit campy. A Korean butler with a sumo wrestler's body and a lethal, steel-brimmed derby is colorful, to say the least. But Harold Sakata's Oddjob became a cultural icon and earns a well deserved tip of the hat. 10 points.Plot: Possibly the cleverest of all the Bond narratives, the film finds Mr. Goldfinger hoping to nuke Fort Knox in order to contaminate the U.S. gold reserve and up the value of his own gold supply. A bit ridiculous, maybe, but so much better than traipsing around looking for some arbitrary McGuffin. 8 points.Production values: An escalating budget is reflected in the slick and polished look of the film. For better or worse, the low-budget grittiness of the previous Bond film is gone for good. 7 points.Bonus Points: That Astin Martin! You've got to love that Astin Martin. 5 points.Summary: Regarded by many as the best Bond movie, it is the gold standard upon which all future films in the series will be judged.Bond-o-meter Rating: 85 points out of 100.",Goldfinger
187,michaelarmer,Goldshagger,9,15 March 2020,"Bond hits the big-time. After 2 so-so films, the 3rd hits the mark, there must have been some doubt after the first and again after the 2nd whether they would continue with the series. But this film settled it, if this was poor we would not be talking about a Bond series, as it would have ended, but this made it.Sean Connery is great in this, with Gert Frobe, making a great bad man. Honor Blackman is great, looking good as well as acting good, Harold Sakata a Japanese/Hawaiian provides the Korean Odd-Job Henchman, one of the best although a non-speaking role. Cec Linder played Felix Leiter in the character's comeback, but not very well. Bernard Lee, Lois Maxwell and Desmond Llewelyn play the usual team.The action scenes are good, but it's the story and the intrigue that do it, it sets the scene for the rest. The locations were all good too, almost all authentic, Miami and Kentucky in the USA, various areas of Switzerland did for Geneva, and the Golf course was in Buckinghamshire, England, however many of the scenes supposed to be there were faked in the studio, but the scenery that was on offer was great and well photographed. The music was great, composed by John Barry and the title song sung by Shirley Bassey, one of the best, probably only beaten by herself again - Diamonds Are Forever A New Bond theme started in this film was Cars, the first appearance of an Aston Martin, a DB5, however this was not the best car in the film, there was a red & white Ford Mustang convertible but the real car star was the 1937 Rolls Royce Phantom III Sedanca de Ville, if I had the money, that's the one I would have chosen. Spectre sat this one out though.On the Bond Girls, the Main one was Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore, however he had at the start Nadja Regin (no. 8) a Serbian who appeared as a Belly Dancer, she was in the last film as well, but in a different role, the inclination was he had already had her and was going back for seconds, then Margaret Nolan (no.9) a British actress (a large busted woman who appeared in a few Carry-On's) who played the character Dink, then Shirley Eaton (English, no.10), easily the best looking Bond girl up to this point, who played Jill Masterson and had the famous scene painted in Gold, then her character sister Tilly Masterson (no. 11), played by Tania Mallet from Blackpool, although he did not get around to shagging her before she got killed. Then Pussy Galore, making her the 3rd Main ""Bond Girl"" but 12th in total so far.A great addition to the series, and one of the best of all time, despite a few faked scenes, without those I would have given a 10.",Goldfinger

189,malkane316,Quick Reviews!,8,25 January 2005,"This is the point where the Bond series really fired into action-terrific stunts, explosive action, good set pieces, memorable villains, car chases, gadgets, and feisty, strong willed women. Probably deserving of being called the best Bond movie, though it is not my favourite, as it has everything a Bond movie should have. It also stands beside other action films for its excitement levels, is full of one-liners and memorable images, and has a very good plot and strong performances from everyone.Bond is investigating a gold smuggler, in a brief turn away from the full blown SPECTRE plots of previous films, and uncovers a plan to destroy the world's economy. Bond meets Auric Goldfinger, the man believed to be responsible, and soon is struggling to stop the plan and save the world.Famous moments- The Jill Masterson 'turns to gold' scene. The 'Shocking' bath moment. The famous Aston Martin's ejector seat scene. The laser scene. These are a few. Pussy Galore, as her name may suggest is Bond's 'girl' this time, and is easily the strongest female character to date in the series. We have Oddjob, a terrifying silent assassin who uses his steel rimmed bowler hat to dispatch of his enemies, one of the best bad guys in any Bond movie, and Goldfinger himself, the archetypal Bond Villain, smart but...dumb. The theme tune is one of the strongest, and the film made sure that Bond had a place in movie history. 8 out of 10.",Goldfinger
190,anton-6,The best Bond movie!!!!,8,13 November 2001,I am no big fan of James Bond films.I have seen them all on television many times.But this is the best Bond film.Sean Connery is very good as Bond and Oddjob is funny.The last 30 minutes is pretty silly.4/5,Goldfinger
191,theshadow908,The definitive Bond film.,8,9 January 2007,"In this 3rd entry to the James Bond series, Bond starts off by investigating a man named Auric Goldfinger, to see if he's cheating at a card game. When Bond straightens Goldfinger out, Goldfinger quickly strikes back, killing Bond's latest fling. Bond wants to find out more about Goldfinger, so he goes on a mission to find out what he's up to. Bond finds out that Goldfinger is attempting to have a nuclear bomb go off inside Fort Knox so that nobody can touch the gold for years, and the price of his personal gold supply will go up. Now with the help of his CIA friend Felix Leiter, Bond will attempt to stop Goldfinger once and for all. This entry into the series is and always will be the best.The reason why everyone and their brother loves this movie so much is that it features all the classic James Bond elements. You have the famous scene where Goldfinger attempts to cut Bond in half with a laser. You have the famous 1964 Aston Martin DB5 complete with machine guns, an ejector seat, and oil slick. This is the first James Bond movie to feature a title song over the opening credits, brilliantly done by Shirley Bassey. This movie features not one, not two, but three Bond girls. Jill Masterson is definitely in the top five hottest Bond girls. I actually feel that her role and Honor Blackman's role should have been reversed, because Honor Blackman isn't the most attractive Bond girl there is. Every scene in this movie is great. It has more action than the first two films and yet it still has a great story. Auric Goldfinger makes a great adversary for James Bond and Oddjob is the greatest henchmen James Bond has ever had to face.Everyone in this movie gave knockout performances. In my opinion, this is Connery's best performance as Bond. Gert Frobe is excellent as Goldfinger, and Honor Blackman is good as the main Bond girl of the film, though she isn't the most attractive Bond girl ever.Goldfinger is the best film in the series and Bond fans should always go back and watch it after seeing crap like Moonraker or Die Another Day.8.5/10",Goldfinger
192,Rammstein-2,One of the best JB's,7,28 January 2000,"Goldfinger is one of the very best Bond movies. The plot and the characters are exactly what you'd wish for. Especially Pussy Galore (that name must be one of the worst the film industry has ever come up with, along with Snake Plissken of ""Escape from New York"") and Oddjob, the hat-flinging body guard.If one should watch the JB's out of order, see this one first.",Goldfinger

194,OttoVonB,Bond number 3: simply irresistible,10,10 December 2006,"Bond (Connery at his peak) battles against gold-obsessed Auric Goldfinger's wild operation Grand Slam, while charming the dames, fighting decapitating-bowler-hat-wielding midgets and preserving a superhuman sense of class and style.It is with ""Goldfinger"" that the definitive elements of the Bond formula really fell into place, from the superb pre-credits sequence referenced in True Lies (Bond removing a wetsuit to reveal a perfectly ironed tuxedo) to the legendary title-song, through the action and over-the-top villains, ""Goldfinger"" attains a balance of class, ruthlessness and silliness that no other Bond film would reach. Connery blasts all other Bond incarnations out of the water, keeping his steely cool even when threatened with laser castration (one of many classic scenes). The villains are a fitting match, from Goldfinger's insecure megalomaniac to the mute killing machine that is Odd Job. And how can you deny the genius of a film with the following dialogue:Bond: ""Who are you?"" Pussy: ""My name is Pussy Galore!"" Bond: ""I must be dreaming...""A few Bond films have come very close to matching Goldfinger's perfection: ""You Only Live Twice"" and ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" in the action and wildness departments, ""From Russia with Love"" and ""Living Daylights"" on a more serious side, or even the more recent ""The World is Not Enough"" in its use of the Bond character. But Goldfinger will always be the ultimate James Bond flick!A treasure: often imitated, never bested at what it does.",Goldfinger

196,dvc5159,I can see why this is regarded as the best Bond.,8,13 June 2007,"Although not as sophisticated as ""From Russia With Love"" it does have a unique storyline at the time. Sean Connery reprises his role for the third time as super spy James Bond, and in this movie he had achieved cinematic gold.The plot, as like the novels, is trimmed down by screenwriters, but somehow it works better in this one as the pace in increased in the film. New Bond director Guy Hamilton gives us a stylish ""new"" look and James Bond, and the screenplay also ave us one of Bond's most memorable lines, ""Lemon-marinated vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred."" Connery delivers, as always. I guess you couldn't say anything about him now. Gert Frobe plays the titular villain who plans to destroy Fort Knox delivers his performance with chilling brilliance. Honor Blackman plays Frobe's right hand woman Pussy Galore (God bless Fleming for that name!)James Bond isn't James Bond with gadgets. That is why Desmond Llwelyn returns with an impressive array of gadgets, including the mouthwatering Aston Martin DB5, which is a prized item in any extreme Bond fan.Overall, not in par with ""From Russia With Love"" (at least for me), but still deserves a spot in the James Bond classics.9.42/10Delton",Goldfinger
197,TheHonestCritic,This is my all-time favorite James Bond movie.,10,17 January 2021,"""Goldfinger"" (1964), whenever someone mentions James Bond, or anything else related to the franchise in that category, I immediately think of this film. This is, without a shadow of a doubt, my all-time favorite Bond movie in the series. It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The story is, a man named Auric Goldfinger, played by Gert Frobe, is planning to rob the gold from Fort Knox and it's up to Bond to put an end to his schemes. Now, to most people, the plot at first glance may sound kind of pedestrian. But, that's one of the biggest reasons why it works so flawlessly. A perfect storyline for any spy film should be simple, yet complex, which is exactly what ""Goldfinger"" delivers and then some. When the plot is simple, you get more invested in the story and the characters and the complex part is where it captivates the viewer to keep guessing all the way through. This movie has stellar action scenes, great drama and also includes a few laughs along the way from beginning to end. It also includes my personal favorite exchange in the series, where Bond is strapped to the table by Goldfinger and is about to be sliced with his laser. I don't want to spoil it in case you haven't seen the film, but, you'll know the lines when you hear them. The plot does have a few over the top moments, but that's what makes this movie so much fun. All of the Bond films have their over the top elements and most of them are hit and miss. But, when those over the top moments are utilized properly, they can be effective in the best way, which is what ""Goldfinger"" brings to the screen seamlessly along with the other four contenders on my top five Bond films list. As far as the acting goes, it's some of the best I've seen in the franchise. Every respectable actor and actress perform their characters flawlessly. Sean Connery is perfect as James Bond, Gert Fröbe is perfect as Auric Goldfinger, Harold Sakata is fantastic as Oddjob, Honor Blackman is brilliant as Pussy Galore, Desmond Llewellyn nails it as Q, Bernard Lee is stellar as M, and so on. All of them really bring their characters to life! But, the shining star has got to be Sean Connery himself. He is my all-time favorite James Bond actor out of the six. He was born to play this role! Every other supporting actor in this movie is just as stellar as well. The chemistry between the characters is impeccable! All of the sets/locations are stunning, and give this film a beautiful atmosphere. You can't go wrong with filming your movie in Europe, or anywhere in North America! All of the special effects are perfect and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack composed by John Barry is phenomenal. John Barry is one of my top 10 all-time favorite film score composers, and the soundtrack for ""Goldfinger"" is one of his best. It also has one of the best theme songs in the series, the title song: ""Goldfinger"", by Shirley Bassey. Now, I understand that a big and brash song like that may not be for everyone. But for me, it sets the tone perfectly and gets you into the mood for the movie right away. Her voice does sound a little brassy at times, I suppose a good nickname for her would be Shirley Brassy! That being said, it's the perfect theme song for this film and it hooks you to the story immediately. ""Goldfinger"" is nothing short of a masterpiece. It's my all-time favorite Bond movie! I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you're getting into the Bond series for the first time and don't know where to begin, start with ""Goldfinger"". It is the epitome of James Bond movies and it set the standard for not just the Bond franchise, but for spy films in general. Let's wrap up this review by giving a moment of silence for the late, but great: Harold Sakata, Gert Frobe, Honor Blackman and the one and only Sean Connery. May you all rest in peace and thanks for all the years of entertainment. Any way, go and see ""Goldfinger"" today, it is pure gold!",Goldfinger
198,mikeiskorn,Brilliant,10,13 September 2021,"Rewatching all the Bond films in preparation for the new one and rewatching this again was brilliant. I forgot what a good film it is. I agree with another reviewer, it's quintessential Bond! The one liners, the look and feel of it.",Goldfinger
199,bluesman-20,James Bond is the man with the midas touch,10,4 July 2010,"Goldfinger is perhaps the most famous Bond of all. The Action is fast and the suspense is kept on a constant boil. Sean Connery already feeling the restraints of Bonadage delivers a cool crisp performance here. The Gadgets such as the gadget ridden Aston Martin helped push Bond's popularity up even more. even The bizarre murder of a girl at the film's start She's murdered by gold paint. this leads to Bond having a vendetta of sorts he wants to avenge the girl's death But when M gives him a assignment that concerns Goldfinger Bond is more then happy to take the mission. the plot is not your standard Bond plot. Goldfinger is gathering a group of Mobsters as well as his own considerable air force to commence operation Grand Slam. We find out along with Bond what Grand Slam really is. It appears Goldfinger is working for SPECTRE and they want Goldfinger to invade Fort Knox and set a nuke off in there to make the gold untouchable for at least 59 years . This would throw the world's gold market into chaos and increase the value of Goldfinger's own gold and with the USA'a Gold finances in chaos the USA would tumble into chaos. Brilliant plan except Goldfinger has not counted on 007 to spoil the plans. This movie has the most famous of everything 007 From the most famous villain and his henchman Goldfinger and Oddjob to Bond's most famous lady Pussy Galore wonderfully played by Honor Blackman. To the most famous torture scene in Bond history. Bond faces death by laser while laying on a gold table. ""Do you expect me to talk Goldfinger?"" ""Noo Mr. Bond I Expect you to die"" This movie makes the Claim that the Bond movies themselves are a work of art. And if you don't believe me just pop some popcorn sit back shut your brain off and be prepared to Enjoy yourself with a action movie that delivers all the thrills chills and excitement you can actually want from a movie.",Goldfinger
200,mnpollio,Top-notch Bond,9,22 March 2007,"I don't rate this as high as From Russia With Love despite the fact that it is the most popular and widely admired of the Connery Bond films. It is slicker and more fast-paced, but it never quite attains the grittiness of its predecessor.Bond: Connery virtually owned the role by now and could really do no wrong on screen. There is really no reason to carp about any of his choices here.The villains: The film is blessed with two of the great Bond villains. Gert Frobe's odious gold-obsessed Goldfinger pretty much makes the mold from which many subsequent megalomaniacal villains would sprout, but few seemed as authentic. The torture scene with a laser slowly heading for Connery's crotch while he tries to verbally outwit Frobe is certainly one of the most inventive moments in the series. Harold Sakata's hateful henchman Oddjob, with his legendary razor-sharp hat for beheading hapless victims, surely ranks at the top of most effective Bond villains. The women: Shirley Eaton got a lot of press as the ""woman who gets painted gold"" but she really is not in the film enough to have too much impact. Honor Blackman, as anti-heroine Pussy Galore, is the first resourceful Bond woman who does not require rescuing by the hero, but I am not as fond of her as other Bond women. She is attractive, but missing an element of vulnerability or appeal, and I am never completely convinced of what motivates her at the end of the film. The transition in her character does not make a whole lot of sense.The plot centering on a robbery of Fort Knox is perfect Bond and actually seems halfway possible. The film moves like a rocket and does not get bogged down in too many details, as some subsequent entries do. A perfect example of a prime Bond film - hard-edged and brimming with dark humor and action. Shirley Bassey's title song is arguably the best from the series.",Goldfinger
201,patches89,"NO MR BOND, I EXPECT YOU TO DIE!",9,28 December 2020,"This was my favourite of Sean Connery's 007 adventures, it was faster paced and Bond seemed in real jeopardy which wasnt always the case in the previous 2 films. Dr No was an introduction to mainstream cinema...testing the waters as you will. From Russia with Love was a cold war thriller that worked brilliantly but didnt necessarily set the tone for the future. Gaoldfinger on the otherhand was exactly the blueprint that Ian Fleming's series would follow for the decades to come. Goldfinger and Odd Job were delightful villains and Pussy Galore went down as one of the most recognisable Bond girls ever. Bond and Goldfinger have back and forths that leads to Bonds capture whilst Goldfinger attempts to unearth his masterplan in Fort Knox. Brilliant film and in my top 5 Bond films to date",Goldfinger
202,EvanKevelson,Really an 8.75/ Bond becomes a 15-30 yo Male hero,9,26 February 2021,"Personally when I rate a Bond Film a rate it only in the context of all Bond Films pre-Daniel Craig (being he is a reboot not a continuity Bond). These aren't deep message films they are action films based on a covert MI-6 agent whose missions are to infiltrate, gather Intel and kill when necessary. The Rating also has to be looked at From a historical perspective not only factually but sociological norms of that particular era.
So if I see a review that depicts racism(lack of black characters) or depiction of Connery or Moore as a sick misogynistic animal... I know the reviewer is ignorant of what audiences where pleased by between 1962-1977 etc... They also are just as fanatic in liberal ideology as a religious conservative fanatics. These were till 1973 ""Guy Films"" not date films.
Criticizing Bond on a ""morality"" basis is the same as criticizing looney tunes for excessive violence. It's moronic.
This film solidified Connery as the pre-Daniel Craig indisputable Bond. It is by far Connery's Gold Standard and greatest Bond film he starred in and generationally from its debut till 2002 the Best of all Bond Films. Interestingly the only Bond film by Connery did, which did not deal with the Special Executive Counter-Intelligence Terrorism & Extortion organization AKA SPECTRE.
Great humor, ""Pussy Galore"" dialogue and scenes are hot and hysterical. The opening scene with catching Goldfinger cheating at Gin Rummy- to his Broadway Stage Set at the ranch of Fort Knox, to ""Odd Job"" and his decapitating hat... made this very comical, sexy, with great action. Overall highly entertaining. Of course Austin Powers will pay tribute by making ""Gold Member"".

203,dasa108,Bond maintains his charm in a film that begins to look tedious,6,25 August 2021,"James Bond has no problem using treacherous women as a shield or exercising his judo as a tool of seduction; Bond is still Bond. The problem is with the design of the film: a lot of improbable things put together: an overly talkative villain who could never be so successful in real life, a string of naive mobsters, an assistant who falters at the first plot, incredibly accessible women, and a James Bond who is unlikely to be saved from any trouble. Already in this film, after two good films, we see that Bond becomes a parody of himself.

204,bwaynef,The definitive James Bond film,9,29 March 1999,"Much of James Bond's third big-screen outing is amusing, and much of the amusement is intentional.  Even now, after countless viewings of this film, it's hard not to smile at the name of Pussy Galore.  And Goldfinger's response to 007's question, ""Do you expect me to talk?"" is classic:  ""No, Mr. Bond.  I expect you to die.""  On the other hand, one is more likely to snicker than smile at the scene in which Goldfinger brings together most of the country's crime bosses, all of whom panic and behave like frightened school girls at the sight of a pool table that moves electronically across the floor.  Then there's the silly, all too sudden way the U.S. Army passes out after a fleet of planes drop poisonous gas from the sky.  The soldiers drop to the ground as quickly as the characters in ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" did when the UFO whizzed by, flashing a beam of light as powerful as a wooden match.  Fortunately, such moments are few, and ""Goldfinger,"" one of the best of the Bond thrillers, remains as entertaining as ever.  As Pussy Galore, Honor Blackman proves that a woman need not be under 30 (or even 35) to be sexy, and Connery's performance as Bond is his best in the series. 007 was truly defined in this entry.",Goldfinger

206,stormhawk2021,Best Bond movie ever,9,19 June 2017,"The first of four Bond films directed by Guy Hamilton, and by far the most iconic entry among critics and fans. Pretty much all the Bond movie clichés started right here!! Great theme song by Shirley Bassey, contains some of the most memorable scenes of the franchise (Do you expect me to talk?), fantastic gadgets, and Bond has some truly funny one-liners. The whole affair really feels like a 60's pulp-thrill comic book brought to vivid life, and I mean that in the best sense possible. However, with all these elements that surely make Goldfinger an entertaining flick, why is it I don't LOVE this entry as much as everybody else does? I think it comes down to two critical things: 1. Despite her outrageously hilarious name, I find Pussy Galore to be the most over-hyped Bond girl of all time. Outside of her name, I just find her to be a bland, unremarkable character and don't get me started on the infamous barn scene. 2. The second act, in which Bond is a prisoner of the title villain, is a bit too slow-paced and nearly grinds the whole affair to a dead halt. The fact that the whole second-half of the movie takes place in America doesn't help matters (I find pretty much all the Bond movies that take place in America to be boring) Don't misunderstand, I do enjoy this movie and I do appreciate it's importance to the franchise, but it doesn't even break my personal top ten Bond entries.",Goldfinger

I don't know about that, in fact I enjoyed a lot the first two also, but no doubt ""Goldfinger"" is probably the all-Bond-picture.Sean Connery plays the 00 agent as good as no one after him did so far; his elegant sarcasm and arrogance fit perfectly well with the paid killer Bond really is though he works for the British Secret Service. His car has all the imaginative tricks and Bond makes good use of it; an interesting plot; fine outdoor locations and lavish settings; an excellent and eccentric villain (Gert Froebe) and his menacing and deadly side kick; beautiful Bond girls (Shirley Eaton, Honor Blackman and Tanya Mallet), and great moments (Bond's last meeting with Oddjob works great and Eaton's golden death -though probably impossible in such a short time- is most ingenious).Which one is the best Bond film will depend on each ones particular taste, but in my opinion no one is as much a Bond film as this one.",Goldfinger

Here we have more room for interesting characters and settings.If there's something I didn't like about this Bond it would have to be the sped up scenes that always stand out like a sour thumb. Also while to movie is quite crisp it still has some distance to go before it reaches the same level of drama as Dr. No or Golden Eye.A great film, none the less.",Goldfinger

Bond aficionados can trace the appearance of some iconic elements of the franchise to this installment, such as the Aston Martin and the emphasis on gadgetry. Few Bond songs are as good as Shirley Bassey's eponymous theme. The pre-title sequence here, a few minutes of anything-goes action unrelated to the main plot, created a tradition that would be repeated in most future Bond titles. Yet the extreme campiness of the plot and the villains strain credulity and take Bond out of the realm of traditional espionage heroes. Fans of Bond the spy as opposed to Bond the superhero may well lament ""Goldfinger""'s emphasis the bizarre and the outrageous.",Goldfinger

The second half is merrymaking, but it becomes instinctively over-the-top, but in a good-natured, more cinematic sort of craze. Not 100% my cup of tea though.What. A.

213,rparham,"Pocket this ""Gold""",9,12 November 2006,"With the release of Goldfinger in 1964, the James Bond franchise had hit its stride, and it would prove to be the entry that cemented all the elements that would forever create a ""James Bond movie"" into a formula that has been deviated from very little for the last four decades. Goldfinger is oft-cited as the best of the James Bond series, and while my personal taste edges just slightly more to From Russia With Love, Goldfinger comes in a very narrow second.In Goldfinger, James Bond (Sean Connery) is assigned to investigate Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe), a businessman with a distinct love for all things gold. It is suspected by the British government that Goldfinger is amassing a large supply of gold for nefarious purposes. Bond introduces himself to Goldfinger during a round of golf and then follows him to his operation in Switzerland. Eventually captured by Goldfinger's imposing henchman, Oddjob (Harold Sakata), Bond meets Goldfinger's personal pilot, Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman) who appears susceptible to his charms and he eventually discovers that Goldfinger has a significant heist planned.Goldfinger utilizes almost every element that would become a staple of the James Bond series. It features a snappy, action-packed pre-title teaser sequence that is only peripherally attached to the film's main plot; the main title sequence is a marvelously designed showpiece, featuring a song belted out by Shirley Bassey; it features the most memorable of henchmen, the mute Oddjob, whose principal weapon is his steel rimmed top hat that he can sail through the air like a Frisbee; a memorable female lead in Honor Blackman, and finally, a strong villain with Gert Frobe. After two films that were used to help the producers find their way, in Goldfinger they polished the series to its future shine.Goldfinger was also the film that brought gadgetry to the forefront in Bond films. Goldfinger featured what would become James Bond's signature piece of equipment: his tricked-out Aston Martin DB5, complete with bullet-proof shield, oil slick, smoke screen, machine guns, and don't forget the ejector seat. There are few who have discovered the Bond series as kids and have not been wowed by the super cars that Bond would drive in, and this is the first, and arguably the best. The film gets lots of neat set-pieces out of the car, including a high speed chase through a factory yard and surrounding woods, and gadgetry would almost become a character in Bond films, largely thanks to this movie.Connery has perfected his Bond performance here, with lots of double entendres and one liners to keep him slightly above the fray, while still not detaching from it. Bond is a character that is always able to find a sarcastic comment to make about the goings on around him, but never seem removed from the story. Goldfinger gave the Bond series what is still one of its standout female characters with Pussy Galore. As portrayed by Honor Blackman, she is striking but full of energy and verve, not some featherweight who is just along for the ride (as many Bond girls would prove to be). Gert Frobe is also one of Bond's best villains and Frobe delivers a terrific performance, despite not speaking English (his dialogue was dubbed).With Goldfinger, every element for a successful Bond film was put into place and the winning combination would rocket the series into a successful stratosphere that it would never come back from. It is not unreasonable to say that most of the long term success of Bond can be laid at the feet of Goldfinger.",Goldfinger
214,dobbin-4,Not As Good As From Russia With Love But This IS Bond.,7,14 December 2008,"First in the series coming out in 1962 was ""Dr. No"" which was Bond but different It had a weird starting and without the barrel scene it had something missing that I think all Bonds should have. ""From Russia With Love"" I believe is Bond at his best. It shows all the sides of Bond from the wit and charm of the womanizer to the coldness he has to have in his job. In this third film ""Goldfinge"" we see more of Bond's character unfolding, and together with the bad guy and some of the funnier puns Bond has made in his movie this is certainly one of the Connery ones to remember.Anyway the reason I think this film is not as good as FRWL is that every now and then the plot can get a little bit dozy and while even the boring bits were bits you could watch I think for sheer enjoyment ""From Russia With Love"" is classic Bond.Anyway, this is what Bond is all about, and who could forget the classic name Pussy Galore, it is a name that showed how James Bond could be funny at the same time, and it is hard to believe how in 1964 they could get away with that, but if they had n't they would have lost a huge bit of cinematic history.Overall, Goldfinger is a good inclusion to the Connery Bonds and is my second favourite of his films. I rate this one 73%.",Goldfinger
215,general-melchett,A true classic!,10,9 December 2006,"Goldfinger is one of Bond's greatest successes - and it is easy to see why.Sean Connery is widely acclaimed as the greatest cinema Bond - he was pretty darn good in this film. The monumental image of the woman painted in gold is one that will never be forgotten in cinema, and is this film's finest moment. Full of intelligence and wit throughout, including the scene when Bond foils Auric Goldfinger's cheating at golf, this is a real classic of a film. And it isn't done too badly either - you can't really poke fun at any of the special effects or action scenes.This film is full of great villains - Auric Goldfinger is a truly menacing billionaire of a villain, and the tough, cruel and menacing Oddjob is another memorable nemesis of Bond who is fallen in a great scene by the super-spy. Goldfinger delivered his greatest line when he was about to cut Bond in half with the laser - ""No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die."" That scene still is dripping with tension and fear over 40 years on.This film had far more appeal than Moonraker - partly because it was older and did far more with a lesser-astronomical budget, but mostly because it is more unforgettable and monumental than the 1979 outing. Full of brilliant villains, cunning plans and classic spying gadgets and action, Goldfinger is nothing short of a classic Bond film. 10/10",Goldfinger
216,vranger,Smooth and sexy,9,3 April 2009,"The third installment of Bond was again quite close to the book, and more of a pure spy story than the action flicks the series later became. Made in the 'good old days', when they could film a Bond movie each year and have a hit every time! It is also the container for the most provocatively named of all 'Bond girls', Pussy Galore. Fleming dreamed up a few of these not so sly double entendres, but this one was REALLY out there. LOL This movie was the first Bond film to change locales around the world several times, moving from Miami to England to Europe and then to Kentucky.The manner of death of some of the villains is a bit altered from the book, but for a film adaptation of a novel Goldfinger stays very true to the original story.Sadly, the battle between Goldfinger's forces and the troops stationed at Fort Knox presage a sad development in Bond climaxes as the series progressed.Very enjoyable, Bond is still more of a spy than a commando, sit back and appreciate it.",Goldfinger

Just yesterday I've watched Lived and Let Die and I liked it so much that I decided to watch all other Bond movies and so today I've watched Goldfinger and now I remember why I was so crazy about this film series. OK, maybe special effects aren't that good as in nowadays movies, but still action is very entertaining.

I can't buy it. Yes, this scene is in the book but it's just asking me to suspend disbelief for too long.

Gert Frobe, a respected German actor is completely believable as is Harold Sakata as Odd-Job. 
There are many beautiful Bond babes in this one, including the highly respected Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore.  Great climax at Fort Knox, cool Aston Martin car scenes, great theme music and overall music, and Mr. Connery still has his sense of humor.

Hmm... That is a difficult one because, well, ""Goldfinger"" has dated. (Hell, it was made in 1964. Everything made in 1964 has dated.) But, saying that, if you can get beyond the terrible quips (Bond electrocutes a baddie, puts his jacket on and, practically winking at the camera, says ""Shocking""), and lazy plotting (why doesn't Goldfinger just take the mobster who decides not to join in with his plans outside and shoot him, rather than go through the whole rigmarole of getting him to drive away so that Oddjob can kill him and crush his car?) and displays of the power of rampant machoness (Bond turns the mercenary Pussy Galore - by the way, the greatest Bond girl name of all time! - to his side, just by nobbing her in the barn), it is still a great and very enjoyable movie.""Goldfinger"" is still incredibly funny, has brilliantly choreographed action scenes, looks brilliant in the new digital transfer and, of course, Connery is still effortlessly cool.

223,vox-sane,The Bondiest,10,14 December 1999,"Quintessential James Bond movie that both made and, in some ways, denigrated the series.  It's a good movie -- simple-minded, with some absurd ideas and crude effects, but it's wrong to judge the past by post-modern standards. James Bond had been a blip on movie-goer's radar screens for a few years, but ""Goldfinger"" was the turning point.  Everything comes together and it works better than one of Q's gadgets.  It plays up one of the big themes in Fleming's books -- Bond's ineptitude and survival more by luck than brains -- but also started the downward spiral away from the books and into fx-laden comic book silliness.  The plot is still within bounds of the plausible, and it serves as a well-oiled machine for Connery's Bond, who is not yet Roger Moore's superman.The most intriguing aspect is Goldfinger himself.  Masterfully limned by Gert Frobe, Goldfinger is set up as Bond's enemy from the beginning, and the thread of their rivalry continues through all the episodes.  Goldfinger comes closest to getting rid of Bond several times, with as little talk as possible;  and he has a better reason than future villains had for keeping him alive when Bond is at his mercy.  He is a powerful presence and very real threat from the first post-credit episode.Whether one agrees that the other elements are the best of Bond, it's nearly unanimous Harold Sakata is the best henchman.  From his steel hat down he's the coolest, and became a more potent symbol of the Bond franchise than Connery.But the franchise was damned by ""Goldfinger""'s success, and condemned, like Sysyphus, to keep rolling the same stone up the hill, but each time the hill had to be higher.Fortunately wiser heads prevailed when Connery was succeeded by both Roger Moore and then Timothy Dalton.  In each case, the movies went back to basics -- not necessarily following strict storylines from Fleming's work, but making Bond less dependent on tricks and mirrors and gadgets, and making the villains less megalomaniacal.  With Moore, after a good start with two fine films, his movies took off into even more absurd flights of fancy than ever imagined even in the psychedelic '60s.  (Considering Bond history, it's probably a good thing Dalton's very no-nonsense, licenced-to-kill basics Bond bowed out after his first two phenomenal episodes, before he got sucked into the infernal balderdash like ""Goldeneye"", or worse).Is ""Goldfinger"" the best Bond?  That's too subjective a term. ""Quintessential"" is the best description.  It's not a good place to start watching Bond, either, because it compels one into the one-upsmanship of the bigger-equals-better Bonds, rather than encouraging viewings of the more sensible films in the series, such as ""From Russia With Love"", ""Dr. No"", ""Live and Let Die"", ""For Your Eyes Only"", ""Living Daylights"" and ""Licence to Kill"". But as far as the Bond films go, all its parts work equally as well, and if one could only take one Bond flick to a desert island (magically equipped with DVD) this would be it.",Goldfinger

226,ryan_kuhn,"""No, Mr. Bond. I expect you to die.""",8,11 August 2005,"In 1964, the formula for nearly 20 future movies was set in stone with the third James Bond film, Goldfinger, often regarded the best of the Bond films. I'm in no position to judge the merit of such a statement, but I will say it's a favorite of mine. To start off with, I'm a Sean Connery-Bond person; no warm spot in my heart for Roger Moore or Timothy Dalton, though Pierce Brosnan has added life to the franchise, as far as I'm concerned. In Goldfinger, Connery exudes everything that makes James Bond that character that we think of: suave, cool under pressure, quick on his feet, a ladies man. We see the ladies of Bond, from the first scene to the last, as Bond conquers not only evil herion dealers to a loony gold-hungry super villain who's plan is a simple one: take over Ft. Knox and crash the gold market. So the plan is silly, and the execution of the plan is just as absurd, but with most Bond movies, the plot is not what's important, it's the scenes you're expected to see. In Goldfinger, we get to see the Bond-blow something up scene, the Bond-flirt with Miss Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell) scene, the Bond-meet with Q (Desmond Llewelyn) and get vital equipment scene, we see Bond-roll in the hay with the villain's woman scene (literally in Goldfinger), and we see the return of the villain for one last hurrah scene. The formula is all there for us to see in Goldfinger, and we'll see it again in the future. The joy of Goldfinger is the villain, Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe), with his head henchman Oddjob (Harold Sakata), as they formulate a ridiculous scheme to take over Ft. Knox and blow up all of the gold inside of it. Oh yeah, there's help from the Communish Chinese too. The movie also features the dirtiest of the double entendre-named Bond girl, Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman), prompting the movie's biggest laugh when Bond realizes who he's waking up to. Goldfinger's special effects are pedestrian by today's standards, and director Guy Hamilton's use of speeding up the film distracts in some scenes, the movie still holds up as one of the ultimate Bond movies.",Goldfinger

Guys just running into a line of fire just to slowly fall over.I do love Connery's portrayal of 007 though! Most people say he's the best and after this movie I may have to agree.Not a bad flick.

228,sandnair87,Goldfinger is the 'Gold' Standard for All Bond Films!,9,23 April 2015,"In Agent 007's third outing on screen, the outrageously entertaining Goldfinger, a vacationing James Bond is informed that his trip to Miami Beach has an ulterior purpose: monitoring the movements of Auric Goldfinger (Gert Fröbe), an international gold merchant who the British government suspects is plotting something vaguely fiendish. Bond quickly gets on Goldfinger's wrong side by ruining his card game and libidinously charming away his female companion, Jill. Those two brash moves don't sit particularly well with Goldfinger and his rottenness becomes immediately apparent as he memorably deals with both offenders. Now with a personal stake in stopping Goldfinger, Bond sets off to stop the glutton-for-gold before he can unleash his sinister plan. Soon, Bond finds that Goldfinger's plot goes much deeper than simply playing havoc with Britain's economy: the rotund madman has a conniving scheme code- named 'Operation Grand Slam' that involves bringing all the economies of the West to ruin by irradiating the gold at Fort Knox and thereby turning the gold basis of the United States' economy into shiny irradiated paperweights – sending the value of his stockpile of bullion through the roof. Bond tries to neutralize the situation, but it's not going to be easy with the hired muscle around Goldfinger - the likes of the oriental assassin Oddjob and Pussy Galore (the first Bond girl with an innuendo-laden name) in his way. The thrill of a James Bond movie, is watching James Bond be his upper crust, chauvinistic, cocky, shaken not stirred self. And in Goldfinger, Bond is at his smug best thanks to Sean Connery's relaxed swagger. Unlike the latter day dashing villains, Fröbe plays Goldfinger as anything but, being slightly uncomfortable and seemingly always uneasy - the exact opposite of Bond. At first glance, Goldfinger seems like a small-potatoes schmuck for the likes of Bond, cheating poolside at gin in Miami with his escort's help. But her death at Goldfinger's orders provides an unforgettably vivid Bond image — her limp body 'suffocated' by a coat of gold paint — and establishes Goldfinger as a psychopath to be reckoned with. That ruthless homicidal rage goes a long way toward selling a physically unimposing gasbag as a formidable cretin, making for a memorable Bond villain. Director Guy Hamilton directs the film with flair and packs the film full of fantastic touches such as the souped-up Aston Martin replete with machine guns, a tire shredder, navigational radar, a smoke-screen device and a passenger-ejector seat. Then there's Shirley Bassey's classic Bond theme, the sinfully seductive '60s jazz that reeks of sex and violence in one protracted explosion of ear-splitting ecstasy. It is perfection and nothing less.Twenty three outings later, Goldfinger still remains definitive James Bond movie - a phenomenon that kicked the franchise into overdrive and really made Bond an icon.

Pussy Galore, played by Honor Blackman, is one of the most famous Bond girls and one of the toughest (although her name is admittedly questionable). The Masterson sisters are in the film only briefly, with Jill, of course, being painted with gold in a classic image.Auric Goldfinger is one of the best Bond villains ever, and is played with panache by Gert Frobe. The scenes between him and Bond are filled with genuine tension. His henchmen, Oddjob, is also one of the best villains of the series. Along with Jaws, he is the most invincible of the Bond henchmen.The plot, while not as gritty or serious as ""From Russia With Love,"" is very engaging with Goldfinger's classic plan to raid Fort Knox. The production set is delightful, taking place in places such as Miami and Kentucky.From the opening scene to the chase scene with the Aston Martin (Bond's best vehicle ever!) to the battle at Fort Knox to the climax in the plane, the action scenes will have you on the edge of your seat.The script is witty and the film moves at a brisk pace. There are too many classic scenes to name, and the title song by Shirley Bassey is one of the best.This is unquestionably the most iconic Bond movie, and for my money, it was also the all-around best Bond movie until ""Skyfall"" came out.

Then we have two fabulous villains, Auric Goldfinger and his henchman Oddjob. Then we have in my opinion one of the coolest bond car ever, the Aston Martin This movie also contains one of my favourite Bond dialogues, in the scene where Bond is being tortured by a laser Bond: Do you expect me to talk Goldfinger: No Mr Bond I expect you to die.There are also a lot of memorable scenes, for instance in the scene where Bond finds the woman he has just spent the night with covered in gold from head to toe.Up until Goldfinger the Bond series was reasonably successful but Goldfinger took the success to a whole new level.

Probably the best in 007 series. So what makes it so good, that no one other even came close to it?Well, actually it got all what 007 movie  should have. Suspense story (111 minutes, without dull moments), a start opening scene with witty humor (""shocking"", ""positive shocking"") that continuous throughout the movie, great villain (Goldfinger) and almost impossible to beat henchman Oddjob (Harold Sakata), Q laboratory (not to mention Aston Martin), superb theme song and finally charming Sean Connery as its best.

Despite her age, she got huge sex appeal and she wasn't immune to Bond charm (well, at least not till unforgettable ""barn scene""), what made her even more sexy.
Sure, you could argue about some holes in the scripts, such as Goldfinger presentation and the attack with nerve gas. Or you could mention the heavy use of rear projections (used to cut the expenses from shooting abroad). But, on the other hand, everything is soon forgotten when you watch one of the most charming movies in history of cinema. A classic.10 out of 10",Goldfinger
233,cosmorados,The birth of the modern blockbuster,9,22 June 2008,"Bond has now wet his teeth with a couple of missions with Sean Connery on fine form as the world's favourite secret agent, he is finding his range within the role and in this, still the greatest bond film in the series, no offence Daniel, he finds his feet superbly, even though he is knocked off them more then once during the film's duration.Auric Goldfinger is a good excursion from the usual SPECTRE villains we have seen in the previous two films, Goldfinger is a bit of a cad, cheats at cards, hires pretty women to be seen with him and is merely a scoundrel. Isn't he? Well no, he's a cold blooded killer who would be his henchman's hand, or his own, dispose of his enemies, coolly and cynically if they get in his way at all. He is not one of those villains who thinks about keeping hold of an adversary as a bargaining chip, Au contraire, he will just kill them. This is what makes Mister Goldfinger such a dangerous villain, with his henchmen Oddjob, he is more than a match for any man.Bond is sent to find out what Goldfinger is up to, a routine mission to explore Gold Smuggling, but the mission turns out to be anything bu that as Bond gets into further scrapes and situations that constantly thrill and entertain as he travels from Miami to England to Switzerland back to the US. This film is the birth of the modern blockbuster for many reasons, it's exciting opening as he concludes his last mission, the great title sequence by Maurice Binder, which so many other films try to catch the eye with, the script is tight, always moving forward either with a cool piece of dialogue or a great action moment, or another confrontation between Bond and Goldfinger or one of his many assistants.Connery is magnificent in this film and from the moment he starts his mission in South America to the final end, with a performance of panache, style and swagger that few would ever get close to matching, the direction by Guy Hamilton is as taught as any in the modern era and the soundtrack is perfect,enhancing every moment at a time when John Barry was heading towards his peak work, with this being a major step.Add Q's monologue for good measure as he bores Bond to death whilst introducing the world's most beautiful car and you really have it all. Yes some sequences have dated a little (Modern audiences would not stand for the ticking clock stuff) but this is great family fare that will certainly continued to be loved by many for years and years to come Nuff said (Check out my other reviews) Em",Goldfinger
234,gtc83,"Genuine candidate for ""Worst Bond Ever""",2,9 January 2006,"I had a lot of problems with this movie. Let me list them: 1) The number two person in the conspiracy to nuke Fort Knox changes sides and betrays her comrades...because Bond slept with her? Gimme a break. Judging from her personality, she'd be about the last person in the world I'd expect to do such a thing. It's obvious that the writers couldn't think of any way of getting out of the corner they'd written themselves into, so they tossed in a deus ex machina cop-out ending.2) Bond just doesn't do much of anything in this movie. He spends the last half of the movie sitting in a cell while other characters run around and do things that don't advance the plot one bit. It's boring. I appreciate the fact that he uses his brains to get out of trouble, but he never really ""gets out"" of trouble, he just turns a bad situation into a slightly less bad one. This is about the only Bond movie where he's so ineffectual, and it makes for a very unentertaining film.3) Bond allows himself to be captured by the bad guys so that he can go and check on the condition of a woman who got hit with a flying hat? He barely knew her! He gave her a ride to a gas station; that's it. It makes no sense that he'd jeopardize his mission in order to check on the condition of a stranger. What was he going to do, give her CPR? He certainly didn't want to be captured as part of any sort of plan, as he spent the next ten minutes of the movie trying to get away again.4) Why didn't Goldfinger just kill Bond? He hit the nail right on the head when he said that Bond only knew the name of the operation (blockbuster), but he didn't know any of the details. Then Bond tells him that if he is killed, they'll send another agent. Well, obviously. Goldfinger certainly must have assumed as much. But how would anyone even know if Bond was killed? It was just another poorly thought out scene.5) Pussy Galore is a really unlikable character. Not only is she just plain homely, but she brags and brags and brags about herself.6) The ending on the plane felt very tacked on and silly. Are we to believe that a woman and a fat guy overpowered all the soldiers in a military aircraft hanger and stole a plane right out from under their noses?Oh, there are a few good things about the movie. The Swiss Alps are beautiful, even in Summer. The car is really cool. And of course the theme song is fantastic.Overall, this is easily the worst Connery Bond film. Much worse than any Roger Moore or Timothy Dalton or George Lazenby Bond movie. I can't for the life of me understand why people hold it in such high esteem, the writing is just so ridiculously sloppy. I enjoy most of Connery's other Bond films, but this thing sticks out like a big, stinky sore thumb.",Goldfinger
235,C22Man,Golden in every way,8,5 July 2015,"Bond Review. Title: Another title named after the main villain and it does have a sophisticated ring to it.Pre-Titles: An action-packed opening sees Bond blow up a drug laboratory, trying to seduce a dancer and dispatching a henchman via electrocution in a bath. This is the perfect pre-title sequence filled with energy and bringing you straight into the action, ending with Bond brilliantly delivering the classic line, ''Shocking.positively shocking.''Theme Song: Shirley Bassey's 'Goldfinger' has become iconic and one of the most popular songs in the series. It has excellent instrumental work, a certain mysterious quality and Bassey sings it with a burning passion.Plot: Bond begins to investigate gold magnate Auric Goldfinger who is accused of stockpiling gold bullion. He soon discovers Goldfinger's plan named Operation Grandslam, which involves contaminating Fort Knox's gold supply and disrupting the world economy. The story is the ideal mix of the far-fetched and espionage. The main plot sounds quite daft, but it is played out with a realistic tone and kept straightforward so that it never gets too extravagant. The pacing is superb once again, the story moves along at a great speed and it smartly only slows down during the most important scenes.James Bond: Sean Connery is at his most content in the role and it is clear that he is enjoying himself throughout. He tones down the rough edges of Bond and really plays up the smooth charm of the character, which sounds like a retreat but it works perfectly for this film. Connery's charisma is at an all-time high and he makes an engaging screen presence.Bond Girls: Honor Blackman, mostly known for her work on The Avengers, is top notch as the famously title Pussy Galore. She flawlessly plays Galore as no-nonsense and initially cynical, but she has believable chemistry with Connery and they share some really good scenes. Shirley Eaton is very good in her small role as the charming Jill Masterson, the image of her painted in gold is one of the films many memorable moments.Villains: Gert Frobe is truly wonderful as Goldfinger. He has a commanding, almost larger than life presence and gets the message across with his facial expressions alone. Frobe makes Goldfinger someone we want to find out more about and he consistently delivers great line after great line. Harold Sakata set the bar for hulking henchmen as the silent Oddjob. He uses his movements and expressions to his best ability giving his mute character, he is a real physical presence and an intimidating figure.Support: Cec Linder is one of the weaker points as Leiter given Jack Lord's great performance prior, he just looks too old to be convincing and comes off more like Bond's goofy uncle than a CIA spy. Tania Mallet is fairly decent as Tilly Masterson and is convincing as someone who wants revenge.Action: The action scenes move seamlessly from small and gritty to big set-pieces. The Pre-titles and Bond's infiltration of Goldfinger's headquarters are really exciting sequences that are heavy on intensity. Bond's confrontation with Oddjob is excellent as well as suitably brutal and the demise of Goldfinger, though dated and daft, is good fun.Score: John Barry delivers one of his best scores here. The music is memorable throughout and adds a striking quality to many already important scenes. He balances everything out beautifully once again, the creeping intense sounds for the low-key scenes and big bombastic numbers for the action.Production Values: Production wise this is a change from Young's grounded approach into something much more slick and stylish that would remain in future instalments. Hamilton clearly has a good eye for shots and he knows how to approach scenes to make them memorable. We get so many iconic moments and pieces here, Masterson covered in gold paint, Goldfinger's laser ready to cut Bond in half, Oddjob's razor hat and the Aston Martin DB5. Not to mention great lines like ''No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.'' Goldfinger is a film that is packed full of unforgettable imagery and that helps it live long in the memory. The locations are all excellent as usual and setting most of it in the United States gives it a unique edge, whilst Ken Adam is back to design more stunning sets. We also get the first signs of Q branch and the addition of more crazy but cool gadgets, which are surprisingly well-thought out here. Conclusion: For many Goldfinger is the quintessential Bond flick and it is very easy to see why. This is Bond at its most entertaining and it goes all out to thrill the audience in every single aspect. It abandons the low-key approach of the previous films, but it doesn't get too unbelievable and keeps you gripped at all times. The plot is enjoyable and keeps you interested, whilst the acting is very good from almost everyone involved. It also set up many aspects that would be poorly copied later on such as big villains, emphasising gadgets and a slightly more humorous tone, but all of these are at their best here. Memorable is the work that sums up Goldfinger the best and it is the best Bond film purely from an entertainment sense.",Goldfinger

237,Kakueke,Best Bond,10,4 October 2001,"Goldfinger is the best Bond movie:  best villain, henchman, sexually-suggestive-nicknamed villainess converted to angel choirs, and most of all, best film symbol, the golden girl, Jill Masterson (played by Shirley Eaton).  I am happy the best villain is outside Spectre, the same old thing. Goldfinger is his own man, completely in command.  My favorites:  Oddjob and the golf ball, and everyone's -- the laser beam and one-liner.  Bond peaked with this movie, and altho Thunderball was good enough to somewhat sustain the Bond phenomenon, it was slightly second best, and the staleness began.  Sean Connery's personal feelings and situation reflected this, and his holdout coincided with the downhill turn.  Don't get me wrong--Roger Moore, though no Connery, added his personal lighter, humorous touch, and provided a needed change.  But after Thunderball, and to some extent Goldfinger, things somewhat faded and became tiresome.  The point is not of that much relevance to those seeing Bonds for the first time today.  But what I am saying is, when Goldfinger, the third and best Bond, came out, it was still fresh, and that was a good combination.",Goldfinger
238,Mikew3001,One of the best Bond films ever!,10,24 January 2002,"With nearly 20 Bond films in 40 years, it's easy to choose a certain prototype of a perfect James Bond movie - ""Goldfinger"". Anything you imagine from a classic Bond film can be found here - a hard and smooth hero (Sean Connery), lush decorations, fancy clothes, well-looking sixties-girls, a perfect (German) villain (Gert Froebe), a menacing, ugly henchman (Oddjob), a men-killing leather gal (Honor Blackman), some nice places all over the world (the bays of Miami, Fort Knox, English golf sites and the impressing mountains of Switzerland), weird gadgets (Bond's stylish special agent Aston Martin), a brilliant title theme (Shirley Bassey's ""Goldfinger"" - also a prototype of typical sixties' secret agent/spy/crime music), one of John barry's finest scores, nice photography and a good pacing and many action sequences.

239,movieman-200,"James Bond (Sean Connery) meets billionaire gold smuggler, Auric Goldfinger",9,11 June 2005,"Although it comes as number three in chronology of the James Bond franchise, Goldfinger (1964) is the most perfectly realized compendium of gadgetry stunts and Bondian sensibilities. From its various inventive modes of untimely demise (Oddjob's decapitating bowler; the compression of an unwilling participant in a junk yard compactor; the first on screen usage of a laser beam), and its audacious Bond girls to the film's most celebrated sleek and silver Astin Martin (with its oil slicks, bulletproof shell, machine gun-totting headlamps and ejector seat courtesy of Q branch), Goldfinger delivers the cinematic goods in every way that a Bond film should. Both Guy Hamilton's slick direction and Ken Adam's marvelous sets provide the utmost visual impact for the story. On all accounts then, Goldfinger is a 24kt hit.Unfortunately, the same can't be said for MGM/UA's DVD. Visually, the film elements vary greatly in quality. Matte shots are not natural looking at all. There is some horrible color balancing during the Miami sequence. Age related artifacts abound throughout. Digital anomalies crop up throughout the transfer, but on the whole are not obtrusive. Extras include two probing documentaries about the film's success, as well as an audio commentary and a host of promotional junkets that are sure to thrill.",Goldfinger
240,bushtony,Pure solid brilliant gold,10,6 April 2011,"What can be said that has not already been said? Very little.So there's no point in repeated analysis of the plot, characters, action, music, set pieces, etc. It's been done.On a personal level, I don't rate it above Dr No, From Russia With Love or Thunderball these days. However, this might have a lot to do with over-familiarity. As a kid I overdosed massively on this movie. For years, I thought it the best thing I had ever seen. Whenever it played in the local cinema or was screened on TV, I was there. I bought the VHS release and played it until it wore out. I had a LaserDisc version that stayed in the big 12 inch drive almost constantly. By the time of the DVD version I was saturated and then saturated some more. And now, still it remains one of the greatest films ever made – even if the gold doesn't shine quite as radiantly for me as it used to. It's a small thing, an infinitesimal depreciation, and matters very little, because I still love it to death.What you've got here is the fully-formed template for the Bond movies. This is the one that is so entrenched in the public consciousness, that so encapsulated sixties popular movie culture, that so engraved itself into the history of cinema, it is simply the Bond film equivalent of The Beatles. Certain phenomena in the arts transcend critique, because no matter what critique is levelled, it has no meaningful impact, slides off the surface and dissolves into the immaterial dust of the utterly inconsequential. Goldfinger is the epitome of the unassailable monument, the unimpeachable icon, the impregnable example of just how rare, wondrous and downright dashed bloody-well good Bond movies – and movies in general – can be.If you really love and are excited by the unadulterated spine-tingling serotonin glory of movies as pure escapist entertainment, there is no more apt, fitting and deserving object of desire upon which to lavish that love.That said, though, I still prefer Thunderball. But what the hell?",Goldfinger
241,adrongardner,Jackpot,8,13 December 2004,"This is the movie that set the tone for nearly every Bond movie that has followed.

242,martinpersson97,The franchise has reached perfection,10,18 March 2020,"The previous film was an improvment over Dr. No, but Goldfinger takes it to an whole other level.Like the last movie, it jumps straight into the action, and the sense of adventure and fun is ever present - Sean Connery is absolutely phenomenal as his dashing and smooth-talking action hero, with this movie, he has reached his uttermost potential.We are introduced to a new villain, called Goldfinger. Unlike Dr. No or Colonel Klebbs, he does not work for SPECTRE, and he is not that much of a badass, but rather a coward, a big manchild who hates to loose and lets others do the work for him. But that does not get in the way of his ruthlesness - and there are some truly shocking scenes in this movie attesting to his evilness.Aside him is his henchman, Oddjob - a ruthless and mute Korean who becomes one of the most memorable Bond characters of all time, standing as the silent tough-guy in this story.Without going too much into spoilers, this is truly Bond perfected. The action-scenes are amazing, and the Oscar Win for its Sound Effects is undoubtly justified. The acting is fantastic, notably from Connery, as always, and Gert Fröbe - they help give us some of the most memorable characters seen in an adventure movie, and delivers some fantastic quotes.If From Russia With Love was The Empire Strikes Back of the Bond-franchise, this is what it would have been if Return of the Jedi (which was still a fantastic movie in its own right) was even better.There are many great Bond-movies, but I doubt any would stand against this masterpiece, which is both one of the best action-movies and best movies of all time!",Goldfinger

The memorable theme song, the beginning sequence that has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, the Bond villain (Gert Frobe, possibly the best of the Bond villains), the cruel henchman (Oddjob), the gadgets (the tricked out Aston Martin) and the clever Bond witticisms; this is what Bond films are known for.  The movie closely follows the Ian Fleming book but leaves out the more controversial elements: Fleming has Goldfinger give a speech on how the Koreans are a very vicious people (embarrassing as it is to read imagine how it would play in the movie), also Tilly is in the book a lot longer than the movie.  In the book, she constantly rebuffs Bond's advances and when she meets Pussy Galore and her all-girl air force we find out why (thankfully the movie never even hints about that).  So even if there are problems with some aspects of the story (as Roger Ebert has said, why does Goldfinger tell all of the gangsters of his plan and ask them to join him if he is going to kill them anyway?), the movie is such fun that it doesn't really matter.",Goldfinger
248,rjsf96,The Best Entry For Many Decades to Come,10,1 October 2015,"'Goldfinger' starts with a bang, an earth shattering and deafening bang. This Bond outing means business. Gone is any sense of calm, down to earth villains and the plot slowly inching forward. Here we have gadgets galore, double entendres and sophistication marked with a stylish tuxedo.007 is given the task of looking into Auric Goldfinger's dealings and affairs. Goldfinger is smuggling his gold from country to country and if Bond can find a connection, then his agency can come down hard on him. Goldfinger though has bigger plans. To break into the gold depository bank at Fort Knox and make the gold radioactive so that no one can access it for half a decade. The value of his gold will then increase to ten times its original value.'Goldfinger' features the first prologue scene that has nothing to do with the main plot of the film. We as an audience though are more than content. This adrenaline pumping action scene pushes the film forward and ensures that we remain thrilled from beginning to end. It amounts to a minor scene; Bond planting bombs in a heroin factory, yet it is intoxicating because of how quickly it draws us into the film without the use of exposition.'Goldfinger' is notable for its gadgets. They are provided courtesy of Q and are rather fantastical and ingenious. His car alone has bullet proof windows, front mounted machine guns and an ejector seat for the uninvited passenger. Goldfinger never takes its self too seriously and that's refreshing to see.Apart from the heart pounding climax that takes place in Fort Knox, there is another sequence slightly more effective and memorable. This is because it is compromised solely of quick and witty dialogue exchanges. This is the laser beam sequence and it remains tense for several reasons. The look of terror on Bond's face, the increasingly suspenseful music by John Barry and the witticisms that come across unforced and with the right amount of power.I'm not sure how the film makers got away with giving the leading lady the name of Pussy Galore. But it allows for unstoppable laughs whenever Bond whispers her name. She is herself an unstoppable force, determined, independent and loyal to Goldfinger. You buy her eventual love for Bond and she even warns him ""You can turn off the charm, I'm immune"".Sean Connery delivers his best performance in 'Goldfinger'. You can tell how he has matured and settled into the role with ease. Gert Frobe as Goldfinger is not intimidating, but great fun to watch as he laps up every second on screen.'Goldfinger' is a rare example of the perfect Bond film that holds up even for today's standards set for an action film. Stunning sets, gorgeous girls, vicious villains, sublime set pieces and memorable music. The list goes on and on. Most amazingly of all 'Goldfinger' remains entertaining from first frame to last. It is sure to leave you shaken, not stirred.",Goldfinger

250,stp43,The Most Popular Bond Epic,7,18 September 2003,"Warning - possible spoilers.Goldfinger is universally hailed as the best of the James Bond films, the third epic in the decades-spanning series gelling together many of the givens that help make the series as entertaining as it is as well as featuring the most memorable villain of the series.What makes Goldfinger a favorite is the mixture of a memorable villain in Gert Frobe's Auric Goldfinger, the audacity of the villain's plot (raiding Fort Knox, KY), and the ability of James Bond to pierce Goldfinger's inner circle in large part due to the arrogance and confidence of Goldfinger as well as the charm of his pilot.Honor Blackman left ""The Avengers"" to become the most famous Bond girl next to Ursula Andress' Honey Ryder. Her character name of Pussy Galore caused considerable tut-tutting in Britain and the US; ""I must be dreaming,"" uttered by Bond upon meeting her is a feeling no doubt matched by many others upon hearing the name Pussy Galore. Though she is the most popular Bond girl, I'm not all that impressed with Honor Blackman or Pussy Galore; she looks too stiff to be really sexy and Blackman plays the role a bit too harshly until the end.Bond has just succeeded in exploding a terrorist's lair in Spain, as well as escape a revenge killing that leaves the would-be assassin electrocuted and a luscious go-go dancer with a severe headache. On leave in Miami, Bond is contacted by Felix Leiter (Cec Linder, the second of six actors to portray James' close CIA compatriot; the different actors used reflected disagreement with what to do with Leiter, who shifted from the Bond-esquire charmer of Dr. No to the bureaucrat of Goldfinger and Diamonds Are Forever to the tough and charming tropical lurker of Thunderball - Rik Van Nutter is my personal favorite of the five actors to portray Leiter - to David Hedison's engaging mixture in Live and Let Die and License To Kill), who tells James that he is to tail British industrialist Auric Goldfinger.James first meets Goldfinger when he is cheating at cards, and James pulls a brilliant double-cross - one that gets him in trouble and leaves a young woman dead. Sir Miles Meservy is very displeased - ""You haven't exactly covered yourself with glory, have you?"" he snaps at a clearly shaken Bond as he ponders demoting the troublesome Secret Serviceman. Sir Miles, however, knows James' real strengths, and at a dinner meeting with the head of the Bank Of England, James learns just why Auric Goldfinger is considered a security issue to the UK.James then meets Goldfinger again, and this next encounter leaves Goldfinger in the hole yet again - all allowing James to surreptitiously tail the industrialist to his corporation's branch in Switzerland, where he starts piecing together clues to Goldfinger's plans.Someone else, however, has a lethal score to settle with Goldfinger, and when the ensuing car pursuit comes to a crashing end Goldfinger's pursuer is left dead, numerous Goldfinger henchman are killed, and James is unconscious, his reputation as a ladies' man in the cross-hairs of a well-aimed laser beam. This is by far the most suspenseful single scene in the entire Bond epic; killing Bond is easy, but ""Can you afford to take that chance?"" amid the pulse of John Barry's most heart-pounding suspense music cue.The full extent of Goldfinger's scheme then becomes clear in a meeting with branches of American organized crime, who have helped Goldfinger smuggle in the necessary tools to pull off the ultimate bank heist. It is a project toward which Goldfinger has invested his energies since 1949 and in which he intends to leave James Bond holding the bag.The only weakness to the film is that James succeeds only because of the sheer arrogance of Goldfinger; it never occurs to Goldfinger that killing Bond will eliminate the real threat to his plan; that keeping Bond alive will convince the authorities to back off requires more than the usual suspension of disbelief to really work. The other aspect of the film that I didn't like is that Bond plays virtually no role in the actual denouement of the scheme. The first two Bond films had him doing just about everything, and one can understand wanting to tone down his one-man heroics, but here they go too far; they don't strike the right balance until Thunderball.Goldfinger also continues the practice first used in From Russia With Love - the false ending, one of the most overused and annoying dramatic devices ever. True, it works both in FRWL (the hotel fight scene) and here (the Learjet fight scene), but the device itself is grossly flawed, double-crossing the viewer needlessly. It nonetheless adds greatly to one of the best scenes in the film - Goldfinger's surprise switch when his plan suddenly goes up in a hail of gunfire.",Goldfinger
251,TankGuy,Exiciting childhood memories,10,17 August 2013,"I always have and always will love the Bond films, I grew up with them, before I got into any other films, I was crazy about the Bond movies. The first one I watched was MOONRAKER(1979)and I was so completely blown away by it that I just had to see all the others, I couldn't get enough of them,Lately,I began rewatching them again to relive my fond childhood memories and I still got that same adrenaline rush that I had all those years ago. The first film I watched was GOLDFINGER, probably the most iconic and best remembered Bond film, the story goes like this, Agent James Bond(SEAN CONNERY)tracks international billionaire Auric Goldfinger(GERT FROBE)suspected of smuggling large amounts of Gold across the world,however,Bond discovers something more serious,Goldfinger is working with the Chinese who have provided him with an Atomic bomb, which he plans to detonate inside Fort Knox, one of the world's major Gold depository's, thus destroying the economy of the western world and making his own Gold shares more valuable.007 must stop him.Now without a doubt, Goldfinger is a classic, the Bond series just wouldn't be the same without it, but a major factor that has always played a big part in the Bond movies is action, every Bond film features a handful of explosive, fast paced action sequences and Goldfinger is one such example. The film begins with an explosion, followed by a bruising fistfight between Bond and an assassin, which is excellently choreographed and impressively staged. My favourite action scenes of the film are the two car chases featuring Bond's Aston Martin and it's trademark gadgets, watch as Bond races down the road whilst being shot at and chased by Goldfinger's men and check out how he disperses smoke and Oil onto the road causing their cars to crash, the part I loved the most was when one car is sent flying over a cliff and explodes into flames. It's hilarious when Bond ejects the guy several feet in the air using the Aston Martins ejector seat and I couldn't help but laugh at the old lady who fires the Machine Gun at the Aston Martin, spraying the windscreen with bullet holes and causing Bond to crash the car into a wall, another excellent stunt. Another thing that impressed me was that the car's really looked as if they were going at breakneck speeds, just watch as the Aston Martin and the other car skid round corners and charge towards the camera, it's one of the most spectacular car chases I've ever seen. The battle at Fort Knox was also fantastic and brilliantly done, although they could have had more close-ups of the action and focused on it a little more rather than splicing it in with footage of Bond trying to detach himself from the Atomic bomb, but it was awesome anyhow. The fight between Bond and Oddjob was amazing and I liked the final confrontation between Bond and Goldfinger on the plane, I was in agony laughing as Goldfinger got sucked out of the window. The action scenes were top notch and suspenseful and I nearly went flying out of my chair watching them.Other scenes I enjoyed in the film was the part were Bond uses the Aston Martins wheel spikes to slash Tilly Mastersons tyres as she overtakes him on the road, causing he to run into a ditch,you'e got to love Oddjobs hat,especially when he uses it to knock the head off the statue, but the one scene that has always fascinated me since I was a child is the scene in which the good looking American car is crushed into a tiny cube in a compactor, this wowed me as a child and I will always remember this film for that one scene. As with every Bond film, there's plenty of one liners(007 on Mr Solo being crushed in the car, ""He had a pressing engagement"")and we can't forget that forever mocked line(""Do you expect me to talk?"", ""no Mr Bond I expect you to die"").Another major part of every Bond film are the colourful title sequences, they're a thing of beauty and I was truly awestruck by Goldfinger's which features golden girls against a pitch black background with scenes from the film projected onto their bodies, another part of the film that impressed me.The soundtrack and Shirley Bassey's main title music are magnificent and the latter will be forever remembered when film music is mentioned.The acting and characters are also flawless but I won't go into detail, Goldfinger is a good strong, sadistic criminal mastermind and no one could have portrayed him better than Gert Frobe.My favourite character is Oddjob,he's one of the coolest Bond villains,right up there with Jaws and the others.Overall,Goldfinger is a highly enjoyable and fast paced action film. I had a great time watching it again and it still has the power to impress me,I know why people say it's one of the greatest, or the greatest Bond film, they aren't far wrong as in my opinion Goldfinger is up there with the very best, not just the very best Bond films, but the very best films ever made. An action packed, energetic thrill ride, a must see for any Bond or action fan.10/10.",Goldfinger
252,loufalce,The Gold Standard of all the Bonds,10,1 January 2007,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? Absolutely THE best of the Bonds, bar none.Remember seeing this when I was 12 years old. I thought WOW! what a movie.Shorlty after that, the first 2 bonds were re-released_ Dr,. No and From Russia with Love.Naturally, I had to see them after Goldfinger, and these three films remain my favorites of all time.Anyway getting back to Goldfinger. Connery is in top form, there is no wasted time in the film, everything works like a well oiled machine and no matter how many times i've seen it {40 is a good estimate}it still thrills me like the first time I saw it. The Aston Martin with the ejector seat is without a doubt the most famous car in screen history. The laser beam torture sequence had me squirming in my seat, the ""hoods convention"" at Goldfingers ranch set just the right tone for the rest of the film, and, of course the raid on Ft. Knox- absolutely a knock out. Bond always has a great one-liner to fit any ocassion{shocking,positively shocking, thats like listening to the Beatles without earmuffs,etc} and of course the best Bond girl of them all- Pussy Galore. Goldfinger and his mute Korean henchman Oddjob are villains in the classic tradition and not the caracatures the later series entries were. There is a great Golf game, beautiful Swiss locations, and the excellent title song.Hard to believe this film was made some 42 years ago! About the only thing that dates it are some of the 60s vintage cars and some of the outfits. Bond mania caught on big time after the release of Goldfinger, and it is easy to see why.Nothing will ever top this. Like a fine wine, it only gets better with age. Can you say that about the Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan Bonds?",Goldfinger

254,TheSeaLion,Leaves me wanting more,6,11 August 2013,"""Goldfinger"" is the second James Bond film I have ever seen and the first of the Sean Connery Bond films. The first Bond film I had ever seen was the 2012 film ""Skyfall"". While I did not find ""Skyfall"" to be bad, I was not impressed by it, nor did it make me want to watch ""Casino Royale"" or ""Quantum of Solace"". However, after watching ""Goldfinger"", it left me wanting to watch more of the missions of Sean Connery's Bond.It is the perfect film to open someone up to the Bond franchise with the mission, the interesting antagonist, and the crazy plot of the bad guy. It is exactly what ""Get Smart"" and ""Austin Powers"" led me to see the series as.This is exactly what I thought ""Skyfall"" should be. Sean Connery was brilliant with his role and is a better Bond than Daniel Craig in my book. The main antagonist and his plan were interesting and did not even come close to a cliché plot like a lot of spy films do. With this film, I have decided to watch more of the missions of Sean Connery's Bond 007.",Goldfinger
255,glenn-aylett,The best Bond movie of the sixties,10,10 December 2017,"This was Sean Connery's best outing as Bond and still an excellent film to watch more than fifty years later.Unlike the other sixties Bonds, Goldfinger doesn't involve SPECTRE and concerns a megalomaniac gold dealer, Auric Goldfinger, who plans to destroy Fort Knox and wreck the world's economy and make the value of his gold soar in value, with some help from Red China.There's not a dull moment in the whole film, from the start where Bond destroys a heroin factory in Mexico, to the end where he has to kill Goldfinger on a plane. Excellent are the lesser characters, Howard Sakata is brilliant as the mute henchman Oddjob, a martial arts expert who has a lethal bowler hat and a sick smile, and Honor Blackman is on top form as Bond girl, Pussy Galore, who is like a continuation of her character in The Avengers and is the only Bond girl to have been older than 007.My favourite scenes are the car chase in Switzerland, where Bond displays his stunt Aston Martin to full effect, Bond being tortured in Goldfinger's factory( "" do you expect to talk, Goldfinger"", "" no, Mr Bond, I expect you to die) and the fight between Bond and Oddjob inside Fort Knox. Don't forget the magnificent theme tune sung by Shirley Bassey( Goldfingaaahhh!), featuring a young Jimmy Page on session guitar. All in all, Connery's finest Bond and one of the greatest films of all time.",Goldfinger
256,scott-sw,Bond hits his stride.,10,4 January 2008,"Most people know their are formulas for action films. But do people know what movies inspired them? The first one of the bunch was James Bond's third adventure, Goldfinger (in case you are wondering, the others include Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, and Point Break). Face it, this Bond film set the standard for all others. Bond must stop Goldfinger from robbing Fort Knox of its gold bullion. In 007's way are a very deadly laser, a temptuous vixen named Pussy Galore, and Odd Job. First, this is the James Bond when Connery put it in full force. Sure, From Russia with Love is the best down-to-earth Bond, but this one started more of the spy movie clichés: the megalomaniac, the hired assassin, the woman with a very sexual name, and the action sequences. It also gives us one of the most tense Bond moments as he faces a laser that threatens to slice him into two. He also faces a very powerful nemesis, Odd Job who throws an iron hat. The best part, I think, is the way he seduces Pussy Galore and brings her to his side. That is what makes Bond the ultimate male fantasy. Not only can he out think opponents, kill the bad guy and deliver clever lines, he always gets the girl. In all the Bond movies, I rank this one as number two, finishing only behind From Russia with Love. Casino Royale is a close number three. All the others finish in Goldfinger's dust.",Goldfinger
257,Katz5,Third Time is Definitely the Charm,9,6 April 2021,"Most consider Goldfinger, only the third film in the franchise, to be the best of all Bonds. Younger viewers can boast about the superiority of Skyfall all they want - Skyfall is a fine Bond film, no question. But it is no Goldfinger. Everything that made the first two Bond films work so well - memorable villains, Bond ladies, a sly sense of humor, witty dialogue, suspense - is on display here, along with a generous does of action. Even people who have not seen Goldfinger must be familiar with the ""No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!"" line. The film's story moves along at a nice pace, setting up the characters, particularly Goldfinger himself (the golf match is classic). Yes, elements are dated - what do you expect for a movie made in 1964? There is a reason Goldfinger is the only Bond film to appear on many ""greatest adventure films of all time"" lists. Watch and enjoy.",Goldfinger
258,Gambitt,Definitive 007,6,3 July 2002,"While this Bond movie is one of the better and more memorable of the series, I still wouldn't call it a terrific movie.  The problem I have with Goldfinger is that its plot and characters are so blatantly outdated.  Overall, the movie is somewhat racist and of course sexist.  The ladies are gorgeous, but generally easy, petty, surprisingly treacherous and not very good at anything else.  (I suppose this might be better than the newer movies, such as the World is Not Enough, in which the audience is expected to believe that an airhead like Denise Richards is a rocket scientist.)Goldfinger is unbridled male chauvinism at its best and worst.   Having said that, I'll admit that it does have a lot going for it.  Pussy Galore probably ranks among the top-5 bond women of all times.  Bond's Aston Martin looked great then and still looks great now.  Oddjob is possibly the best-known bond Henchman of all (plus he's real good to use in the Goldeneye video game; since he's so short he's hard to shoot).  Finally, this movie definitely does have some of the most infamous lines in all Bond history.I didn't think the plot here was particularly good or plausible, though it's no worse than any other Bond flick.  However, I did not find Goldfinger to be a particularily intimidating villain.  He seemed a little too human and ordinary, and his initial scenes showed him dabbling in fairly low-stakes gambling.  Overall, he was one of the least interesting Bond villains.All in all, Goldfinger now shows its wear and tear over time, but it's still required viewing for anyone who claims to be a Bond fan.",Goldfinger
259,wrestlingsitewebmaster,Goldfinger,10,25 March 2008,"Awesome, just awesome.This film had superb acting, superb, interesting characters and above all had some of the best action sequences in any Bond movie.Goldfinger bought us the most memorable characters in any Bond movie with Pussy Galore, Odd Job, Goldfinger himself and Jill and Tilly Masterson just to name a few. When Bond discovers Jill Masterson covered in gold paint this ranks as one of the best and most shocking parts in a movie of all time.The scene in where Bond is sent to Goldfinger's ranch is supposedly in Kentucky, USA but in reality this was shot at Pinewood Studio's in London, in fact the only actor to travel to the United States was Cec Linder who played Felix Leither and I must add was played exceptionally well by Linder but unfortunately fans of the film don't appear to remember him enough than say David Hedison who played the Leither character in Live and Let Die and Licence to Kill.This Bond film did not mention the organization known as SPECTRE which gave us Ernest Stavro Blofeld, Donald Grant and Dr No just to name a few. Perhaps producers decided audiences at the time were tiring of introducing SPECTRE in every Bond film, but what makes up in this film was Auric Goldfinger played magnificently by Gert Frobe. However his voice was dubbed for the film because Frobe could not speak a word of English.Harold Sakata who played Odd Job was excellent in the role and Sakata was a professional wrestler and went under the name of Tosh Togo.One of the best Bond film EVER made.Grade - A**",Goldfinger
260,Marx_Bros_Fan86,The beginning of the gadgetry,9,15 April 2009,"Goldfinger has some of the most iconic images, lines, and gadgets that have come to define the series, for better or worse. The Bond series goes through a typical cycle. It starts out with a more down to earth action film, and they gradually become more and more outlandish until they cross the line. The producers decide to go back to square one. Goldfinger marked the start of the over-the-top gadgets and villains, but I think it is has a better balance between the outlandish and serious aspects than some of the films that followed it.It's all here, the Aston Martin car equipped with bulletproof glass, spikes on the hubcaps, and a passenger ejector seat. Jill Masterson, the woman painted in gold, is a classic death in the series. We also have Odd Job, the Japanese henchman with a deadly bowler hat. Gert Frobe plays Auric Goldfinger, who straps Bond to a table and nearly kills him with a giant laser. His line ""No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die"" has become a classic rebuttal. Goldfinger was one of the more comical Bond villains, partially due to his appearance, and he had good chemistry with Connery even though Frobe's voice was dubbed. The plot was as ludicrous as ever; Goldfinger plans on detonating a nuclear bomb in Fort Knox, making the U.S. gold supply radioactive, thus increasing his stock. The inside of Fort Knox was like a dungeon, but the real Fort looks nothing like it. A brutal fight with Odd Job and Bond ensues, although it was not as brutal as the fight with Red Grant. Honor Blackman, Goldfinger's pilot, was the first Bond girl whose voice was not dubbed. Her performance stands out as one of the better girls of the Connery era. Connery is great again.My one criticism would be that Goldfinger drags in the middle. I find Bond films often have problems with pacing and length, and James Bond follows Goldfinger's car for a little too long. For its time though, this was the most action packed film in the series and it remains on the top of many people's Bond lists. It was my first Connery Bond film so it is my sentimental favorite.",Goldfinger

263,eamon-hennedy,A Golden Classic.,10,28 April 2004,"I tell you what is wrong with this film. Nothing, not one thing. Ladies and gentlemen, this is as close to cinematic perfection that I have seen. Entertaining to the extreme, featuring some of the most famous scenes in the history of cinema as well as showing how good Bond films can be, Goldfinger is quite possibly the best Bond film ever made. I love Bond films, don't get me wrong and I love all the actors who have played the part over the years, but Goldfinger is a cinematic cocktail of perfection. Setting in stone many of the trademarks we associate with Bond films, Goldfinger has it all; a pre-title sequence that is more or less a mini-Bond adventure, beautiful women, a maniacal and brilliantly over the top villain with equally over the top henchman (he breaks golf balls with his hand), car chase with Bond's car full of helpful gadgets, a cracking theme song and a great music score from John Barry, not to forget, great puns. The film is brilliant throughout and while the Bond films did get bigger and some are equal to Goldfinger, it is arguable if some have bettered it.Sean Connery as James Bond is superb throughout, his delivery of the his dialog superb and his performance assured and confident. Gert Frobe may have been dubbed, but he has screen presence and while Harold Sakata does not say any lines, the same is true of himself, with his fight against Bond in Fort Knox superbly staged. Honor Blackman is just gorgeous throughout and her silky delivery of her lines and the manner of her performance is one of the highlights of the Bond series.Overall this is a great film, it is has it all, action laughs and one liners aplenty. Guy Hamilton's direction is slick throughout and the film moves at such a pace that the 105 minute running time flies by. While whether its impact on the Bond series is a positive or a negative one remains argumentative, but nevertheless this is one of the funnest films committed to celluloid.",Goldfinger

Sean Connery returns as Agent 007 as he is sent out to investigate a mysterious gold lover by the name of Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) and he discovers the mad mans secret plans for the biggest bank job ever in the history of the world, the robbing of Fort Knox.This film is pure Bond, it gets everything right. With 007 you get separate ingredients all Bond films have but not well put together but with this film, even in the first scene, you get the whole Bond flavor. This film is the best 007 film to date with the best villain. Oddjob played by Harold Sakata has given one of the best performances of the evil henchman, being the most famous in the whole series till Jaws came along, and the plot is memorable. But what is a Bond film without a beautiful Bond girl and this film delivers with not just one Bond girl, but three! You have the beautiful Jill Masterson who you see in one of the most famous Bond scenes ever, her corpse painted in pure gold paint. Next you have Tilly Masterson, Jills sister, who sadly gets killed by Oddjobs killer bowler derby hat, and you get the main coarse with Miss. Pussy Galore. And aside from the famous quote "" Bond...James Bond"" you get the one single line that everyone in the whole world will remember after this film. ""You expect me to talk Goldfinger?"" ""No Mr. Bond I expect you to die!"" You'll get caught up in the tense fight between 007 and Oddjob in the vault of Fort Knox with a ticking nuclear time bomb about to go off, and you'll get in depth with the villainous schemes in the Operation Grand Slam scene with Goldfinger and his investors.

265,Umar Mansoor Bajwa,Sean Connery at his Best !,9,9 July 2006,"Ian Fleming's and Albert R. Brocolli's first selection for the James Bond role is appropriately perfect as far as the original novel related Bond is concerned. That is to say that Sean Connery's physiognomy and aquiline facial contours are the perfect representation of what a clever,intelligent, bold, suave, tall and handsome hero has to portray. Being a pioneer James Bond and imbued with the original reflection and demeanor that was required for the particular spy character and surely guide lined by the writer himself, Sean Connery was the perfect choice.It is, however, sad that Connery, after performing just in five bond flicks became tired of the stereotypic role and refused to play anymore. George Lazenby took the torch for only one Bond outing before Connery realized his mistake and agreed to play the same dashing role in ""Diamonds are Forever"". Thereafter, upon his final refusal to play James Bond, Roger Moore appeared on the scene who had been earlier rejected by Brocolli (considered by Fleming) for sporting a too pretty and soft visage to come up to the robustly clever role.Roger Moore, by that time i.e, 1973 had already passed his prime lovely youth while playing Simon Templar in TV series - ""The Saint"" and by that time had established himself to portray the image of a bold suave and urbane detective. His pretty features had also diluted and his appearance became mature with the passage of time. While with Connery, the producers got annoyed for his erratic attitude and signed Moore for a number of Bond movies. Later, Connery regretted a lot to have done away with such a good team, good money and lucrative perky role. He came in legal brawl with Moore to recapture the title role which was appropriately set aside by the court.As far as, Goldfinger is concerned, it is, an improved version of Dr. No. and From Russia with Love having good musical score, as well. Besides, Bond, Goldfinger and OddJob, the deadly steel hat did also carry a lot of suspense adding a new dimension to the heroism of James Bond. Honor Blackman was primarily selected for the role because she boldly accepted the outrageous name of Pussy Galore for the lead feminine role, whereas, other actresses had denied to perform with such a rude name.Last but not the least, Guy Hamilton's direction was good enough to elevate the 3rd Bond movie to a real success story.",Goldfinger
266,CalDexter,The Ultimate Benchmark for the future Bonds.,10,2 June 2007,"Goldfinger is the Ultimate Benchmark in the James Bond series. This was the blueprint in plot, guns, beautiful women, evil foes, evil henchmen, enthralling title song (GOLDFINGAAAAAA!!!!) and World Domination plans.Sean Connery clearly enjoys playing James Bond here for perhaps the last time. He now clearly dominates every scene hes in. Sean Connery IS James Bond (although his hair is starting to look false) he looks ice cool in white Tuxedo in the Pre-Credits sequence walking into a Mexican bar like he owns the place while lighting a cigarette. He puts Rick in Casablanca in the shade on appearance alone.Gert Frobe as Auric Goldfinger is a criminal Mastermind you will never forget. Every scene Frobe is in, despite being charming and charismatic, you never know just how evil and cold blooded his character really is. The title song by Shirley Bassey is memorable, but after listening to it a couple of dozen times over viewing periods you will get sick of it.Harold Sakata along with Richard Kiel is the ultimate Bond Henchman. Crushing golf balls in his hand and chopping statue's heads off with his Razor rimmed gentleman Butler's hat, he is the character you will remember most when you first see this film.

Less gadgets, more spy caper.Goldfinger is a great 007 film, and indeed can fit my classification of epic, but there are some better 007 films. This movie does have it all, however, with a great sinister villain who is as human as the rest, a hot broad Bond Girl in Pussy Galore, and of course, another Felix Leiter... a trend that carries on today.

Ahem.Okay, how about the fact that Goldfinger doesn't kill Bond, but waits for a laser to very slowly cut it's way towards him? Although this creates brilliant tension and provides the series with one of it's greatest pieces of dialogue. I will not bore you by repeating this.What about the fact that Pussy Galore turns against Goldfinger after a quick bit of slap and tickle with Bond? Though she wasn't very keen on Goldie anyway...Oh hell! I give up. There really is very little wrong with this sublime movie. It sticks relatively to the plot of the original book, it has sexy women, it has Oddjob and His Spinning Hat of Menace.

That said, this was a very enjoyable movie, with clever dialogue, memorable villains and unpredictable plot turns.  The picture quality suffered a few times due to age, but the colors were fairly vivid.  What I found most refreshing having seen a few of the more recent Pierce Brosnin Bond films was the lack of frenetic editing and pounding music during the action/fight scenes.

272,TimBoHannon,24 Karat Bond Adventure,8,10 March 2013,"By consensus, ""Goldfinger"" remains the best of the Bond movies. The third James Bond movie took 1964 by storm and influenced action movies for years afterward. It was the fifth Bond that I saw, and it took me awhile to sweep aside the aura and focus on the movie. I liked what I saw then, and I still like it now. I prefer ""From Russia with Love"" and some of the later Bonds, but ""Goldfinger"" should not be discounted as an excellent movie.The movie opens with a fun scene where Bond sabotages a heroin dealer, but he spends the bulk of the movie locking steel with a completely different villain. Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe, voice of Michael Collins) is an obese international businessman whose obsession with gold is so extreme he will ""welcome any enterprise which will increase his stock."" This naturally concerns the Bank of England, since gold was still used in 1964 to set the value of the pound and large scale smuggling could reduce their accuracy.This is where James Bond (Sean Connery) comes in to gather evidence for the bank to use in court proceedings. That soon becomes unimportant as Bond quickly discovers that everybody has been thinking way too small regarding how far Goldfinger's greed will drive him. On Goldfinger's payroll are a pilot named Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman) and a Korean named Oddjob (Olympic weightlifting silver medalist Harold Sakata).Oddjob is the best supporting villain in the series. As a man of no words, he allows his gaze and smile to speak for him. Oddjob possesses massive physical strength and prefers to kill his targets with a chakram doubling as the brim of his ever present bowler hat. Although he is intimidating from his first appearance, it is not until the movie's splendid climax that we see the awesome extent of his physical capabilities. Only Jaws rivals him in the debate for most acclaimed henchman in the entire series, and I think Jaws is overrated.Unfortunately, Oddjob also spawned a bad habit. Starting with ""Diamonds Are Forever"" eight years later, the producers often looked to emulate the style of ""Goldfinger"" in future movies. By the middle of the 1970s, they had already filmed the most memorable of the James Bond novels and had to start writing their own stories. Jaws was the first of four nearly invincible supporting villains, but, unlike Oddjob, they often looked farcical. It is a feat of toughness to absorb a direct hit from a gold bar. Being able to lift up and throw a motorcycle is corny and stupid.""Goldfinger"" is lighter than the first two 007 adventures. Composer John Barry employs relaxing violin measures during a scenic drive through the mountains of Switzerland, contrasting the horn crescendos in the score of ""Dr. No"" and the foreboding notes heard during ""From Russia with Love."" The indoor scenes are more brightly lit than before, and the humor is increased. The running tension between Bond and MI6 equipment manager Q (Desmond Llewelyn) started in ""Goldfinger"" and grew into one of the Bond series most endearing elements.Twenty-three James Bond movies have made the series' hall-of-villainy crowded at the top. Goldfinger belongs in that crowd. The fact that Oddjob works for him boosts his credibility by itself. Mr. Goldfinger sees no need to be loud, unpleasant, or brutal to make his point. Pussy Galore, who along with Octopussy has spawned quite a few questionable jokes through the years, is more useful than Honey Rider and Tatiana Romanova were, but also a slightly inferior character. Shirley Eaton provides some additional beauty as Jill Masterson, the first and greatest golden girl.Connery is splendid as usual in the action scenes, especially the showdown with Oddjob, and some good special effects and a witty script help along the way. Finally, the fun gadgets elevate the overall quality, from Bond's special scuba suit to the great Aston Martin DB5 with modifications.The movie's first 50 minutes stand up to any film in the series. Every chapter, from the ""shocking"" opening moments, the mental jousting of the golf game featuring a delightful bit performance by Gerry Dugan, to the factory spying and the car chase, are as good as any Bond film can hope for. The middle act is short on excitement and runs slightly too long; on the other hand, it is hard to find anything to remove that would make the movie better.Many of the Bond movies' recurring trademarks started in ""Goldfinger."" I have never thought is should be declared best Bond movie for that reason. It also would be wrong to give later movies too much credit because they improved on what ""Goldfinger"" started. In a way, its legacy lives in each of the 20 Bond movies that have followed. In the end, the reason I do not place in my top five Bond movies comes mostly from my personal preferences and not any weaknesses of the movie. As I said, I liked it the first time, and I like it just as much now. High quality movies often do that.",Goldfinger
273,thegulls1,Classic Sean Connery entry...,8,19 February 2020,"I saw this several times at the theatre in my youth--it was really the first high-flying gadget-electronics driven film in the Bond series (although a couple of plainer 'gadgets' saved Bond's life in the previous FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE). This film sparked a rush of imitators & knock-offs
(Dean Martin's Matt Helm & James Coborne's FLINT series). No one quite matched Connery's cold-hearted charm, however. After all, if you read the books, Bond was far from a nice guy--the 00 meant he was a killer, after all.I'd like to comment on 1 weakness & 1 strength in the film:1) Early, Bond catches Goldfinger cheating at cards, & nails him for it, but he was supposed to be doing a surveillance. He also steals his girlfriend. Talk about blowing your cover. Wouldn't look good on a spy resumé.2) In the book, Goldfinger plans on robbing Fort Knox of its gold--absurd, right? In the movie, Goldfinger plots to contaminate that gold with radiation, thus increasing the value of his own holdings---brilliant, eh?The film has a super-villain, OddJob, who is a brilliant addition, a karate expert who also wears a razor-plated frisbee for a bowler hat. Will Bond beat this guy?Anyway, overall, the movie is a classic (even if it's a bit dated) and well worth seeing if it hasn't crossed your path yet.",Goldfinger
274,thescholar22,Goldfinger Review,9,9 June 2015,What can you say about the James Bond classic made in 1964. This was what got people into the James Bond franchise. This time he takes on Goldfinger a rich guy that just loves gold and it's color. Goldfinger also has a manservant Oddjob who has a metal rim on his hat like King Lao from Mortal Kombat. There's also James Bond's new car that also has ejector seats in it too. As well as some scenes that show you how it works. Even this one scene where Bond gets captured and Goldfinger has him tied down and uses a laser to kill him. There's also Pussy Galore a lady pilot that's allied with Goldfinger in a scheme that involves Fort Knox. That's also where I think I'll stop and try not to spoil too much and let you all see it yourself. The movie is a classic and it was amazing seeing all the sets and the 1960's feel as well.,Goldfinger
275,ToldYaSo,The superlative James Bond film,9,20 July 1999,"First of all, I must state for the record, Sean Connery is THE James Bond. Even though the first Bond film I ever saw was ""For Your Eyes Only"" with Roger Moore. I was very young and very much drawn in. I have seen every one of the Bond films and without a doubt, ""Goldfinger"" is the finest the 007 saga has to offer.Before I had begun an appreciation of the Connery films, i.e. before I'd seen them, a good friend and cartooning mentor, Ross Paperman, sorted me out. He helped me see how Connery's Bond was suave and sophisticated but also demonstrated a quality the other Bonds do not portray: fear. Not a panicky soil-your-pants kind of fear, mind you. But Connery's Bond actually has a few anxious, sweat-soaked-brow moments. A perfect example is when Bond is strapped to a table as Goldfinger's captive with a laser beam primed to cut him in half. 007 has to think fast. ""Do you expect me to talk?"" ""No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!"" A famous scene and line from Bond's most enjoyable film.Perhaps what makes the earlier films more enjoyable is that they had fresh, innovative elements that have now become cliché and gimmicky. The new films are often stale and already covered ground and they don't even appear to be trying anymore.But it's more than that. Even watching ""Goldfinger"" today, having seen all the latest in special effects and technology that Hollywood has to offer, it still is riveting and thoroughly entertaining. That is also without the added advantage of being overly nostalgic about ""Goldfinger"". How could I? I hadn't even been born when it first hit theaters, and it was far from my first 007 experience. The story, the characters and the fun of ""Goldfinger"" is timeless and if given a chance could probably rope in a whole new generation of fans. It just doesn't seem likely to happen.Much of the satire from the Austin Powers films is directly derived from the Connery films, especially ""Goldfinger"" and ""Dr. No"", proving their lasting effect on popular culture. As well, John Barry's scores from the Connery films are finding their way into the ears of a new generation through pop music as snippets from his soundtracks are sampled by such artists as Robbie Williams, Mono and Curve, to name a few.But if by some fluke you read this and you haven't seen ""Goldfinger"" yet, do yourself right and acquaint yourself with the real James Bond. You'll probably be hooked by the time you hear Shirley Bassey's voice in the famous opening theme.",Goldfinger
276,MovieJunkie1976,The formula falls together,8,16 December 2014,"***Warning! Spoiler Information Inside***After the wide acceptance of From Russia With Love(1963), Eon released the follow up Goldfinger to great expectation.Bond is tasked by M to determine why considerable sums of gold are leaving Britain's banks. His search leads to the American Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe). Goldfinger it seems loves gold , loves it so much he's intent upon owning it all. Including Fort. Knox.Goldfinger was masterfully directed by bond rookie Guy Hamilton. At this point Bond had been a female attraction (owing to Sean Connery). The franchise at last settles in this movie with the gadgets , girls and guns, taking a decidedly male turn in culture. Bond girls include Honor Blackmon (Avengers), and Shirley Eaton as the famous woman in gold.Four stars(of 5.)",Goldfinger

278,Theflyace,Bond Month #3: Let's have a little fun with Mr. Goldfinger...,9,30 September 2013,"The first Bond movie that I ever had just plain old-fashioned fun while watching. Goldfinger has it all. There's a memorable Bond (Sean Connery at his greatest as 007), a great villain, great Bond girl, and of course a great plot and great action sequences. Words cannot describe how good Goldfinger is, but I'll try it anyway.Instead of getting a taut Cold War thriller that was From Russia with Love, we get a surprisingly intriguing smuggling/monetary inflation story. Bond is ordered to trail a German banker named Mr. Goldfinger (played deliciously by Gert Frobe) Goldfinger's number one obsession is obviously gold, so he seeks to increase his stock by destroying the U.S. gold supply located at Fort Knox with a dirty nuclear bomb.Goldfinger is a great larger-than-life villain, but is very restrained n the sense that he just want more gold, which is the great love of his life. He's not trying to take over the world, which to me is a breath of fresh air. The sidekick, Oddjob, is also very memorable. Harold Sokata became world famous for throwing the steel-brimmed hat and silent but menacing performance every henchman has tried to match since.And then we have the ever awesome, ever popular, ever innuendo inducing Pussy Galore, played by Honor Blackman. Hee-Hee, that name, ha ha never gets old. But thats not the only reason why we remember her. She's driven, sassy, smart, but according to the original book, a lesbian, which is why she says, ""Turn off the charm, I'm immune."" I'm not opposed to this, that's actually very unique, but of course Bond easily (well sort of) gets inside and changes her over. Bad James, bad.And then we have pretty good action sequences. We are introduced to the greatest car of all time, the gadget-laden, sleek super car known as the Astin Martin DB-5 (It's also the first film where Desmond Llewellyn really shines as Q) And we also get a great, if fantastical view and fight inside the vault at Fort Knox, the background provided by legendary production designer Ken Adam.This film is a quintessential Bond film. I do give a lot of credit to director Guy Hamilton for injecting the series with more fun and sly humor in this film (even though he didn't do so hot in the 70s, but I'll get to that later) Heck, this is probably the most iconic Bond film of them all, and for good reason. Goldfinger is a lot of fun to watch, and golden to look at.",Goldfinger
279,badfeelinganger,Perfection. How can you top characters with names like Odd Job and Pussy Galore? The best of the Bond films.,10,7 October 2014,"The iconic James Bond movie, this third entry into the franchise is rightly heralded for offering the perfect blend of action, adventure, gunplay, fisticuffs, gadgetry (that Aston Martin!), romance, derring-do, and just about everything else.It has Shirley Bassey's operatic theme, the Aston Martin and Shirley Eaton, killed with that magnificently macabre gold paint.The one that all other Bond films must live up to, and the only one of the films that surpasses the book upon which it is based.Goldfinger remains the gold standard for the Bond movies. Recent entries can't compare to this lustrous thriller, a throwback to when the term ""thriller"" had meaning.These Bond capers were the prototypes and set the gold standard for dozens of fantasy thrillers that followed. Probably the best of the gadget-filled 007 extravaganzas.Q brings out the Aston Martin for the first time, and Shirley Bassey shatters the speakers with the consummate Bond song.The definitive, quintessential Bond.",Goldfinger
280,The Spectacular Spider-Man,"Effortless cool, Bond was never greater",10,5 October 2008,"Now, we're talking.What Goldfinger does, that so many subsequent Bond movies forget, is not overdo things. It underplays everything. This is a movie of such effortless cool and style that it's sweeps the viewer along with charm. Many Bond movies also jar between action and non-action scenes (The World is Not Enough, for instance). Goldfinger moves through the gears with aplomb.Goldfinger is so stylish that even the pre-credit sequence contains more cool than the entirety of most 007 films. You have the iconic wetsuit/tuxedo scene; Bond lighting a cigarette just as an explosion goes off; the unflinchingly brutality of Bond electrocuting a man then just turning away to make a quip; and finally him slamming the door - even than leads perfectly into the Shirley Bassey theme.Everything is pitch perfect. Goldfinger himself is the ideal combo of vulgar greed and gentlemanly host. A perfect foe for for Bond. Pussy Galore combines the voluptuousness of 60's Bond girls with the spirit of the more modern ones. Connery himself is the epitome of Bond; charismatic, tough, ultra-suave.There are plenty of standout scenes; the laser-beam table is unmatched in the series for sheer, pure tension; the aston martin chase is again one of the best in the series and shows up similar scenes in the likes of Die Another Day as merely visual showcases - this one is genuinely exciting. Bond's fight with Oddjob set the template for numerous, 'How do I stop this guy?' cat-and-mouse fight scenes, especially in Spielberg movies.You might argue than Goldfinger could do with at least one more action set-piece, as it does slow down before the climax whilst Bond is Goldfinger's guest. But it wouldn't really fit into the story. As a Bond film, Goldfinger is practically perfect. Connery even has the best wig.",Goldfinger
281,QKnown,The most over-rated Bond of all!!!!,1,4 January 2000,"Sorry guys, but I just can't see why so many of you agree that this is the best Bond flick. I won't go too far as to say that it's the worst one, because there are a few moments (just a few) that make it ok.   
The pre-credits sequence is cool. The title song is cool. Oddjob is cool.....But that's it!!Auric Goldfinger turns out as a bumbling, non-threatening menace. I mean, after he's been outsmarted by Bond at the card & golf games, he no longer appears as a super villain and his character becomes worn out. And besides from turning Pussy Galore into a heterosexual, what does 007 actually DO in this flick? He destroys the Aston Martin(the only exciting scene in the flick). He gets locked up for half of the movie. Escapes. Gets caught. Gets locked up again. *Yawn* Gets his a$$ kicked by Oddjob until he uses his smarts.And then sits back & lets Leiter deactivate the bomb. Geez! And I know deep down that you GOLDFINGER lovers have to let out an embarassing chuckle when the Fort Knox army gets gassed. Yet this was the one that paved the way for the comic book approach for Bond. That can be considered good or bad. It depends on what can of James Bond fan you are. But FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is, and will always be,  the best of the early 007 adventures.  'Nuff Said!",Goldfinger
282,jbirtel,"Pure, Implausible, Grand-Slam Escapism",9,25 November 2002,"Every other Bond film that follows is a pale attempt to recapture the recipe of 'Goldfinger'. The movie makers had the ingredients for the follow-ups, but it never quite captured the magic. What we got is just more circus stunts, goofy gadgets and less enthusiasm. Connery justifiably left and no one has done it as well since. Connery shows what a great actor can do; with vulnerability, cool assurance and class.'Dr No', 'From Russia With Love' and 'Goldfinger' are THE summation of James Bond. The rest have moments of greatness, but ended up with episodic parts that were better than the whole.The best background music in the entire franchise (notice I didn't say series).9 out of 10. Full of flaws, but why carp!",Goldfinger
283,skiop,OK Bond flick,6,11 June 2006,"Often considered the best Bond film, it's hard to understand why. It's all so very average and can't approach ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" and ""Licence to Kill."" The trio of villains -- leader Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe), pilot Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman) and manservant Oddjob (Harold Sakata) -- amount to little more than petty bank robbers. And Bond (Sean Connery) romps around, sleeping with an unrealistic amount of women for the time frame (let's face the fact that he's not that charming, sexy or alluring).In all fairness, this was the Bond film that marked the transition from thrillers to action comedies. But the over-the-top nature is downplayed by all concerned and the climax has nothing to make it stand out. No volcano, no space station, no hopping between oil trucks. Just a dull, bland blink-and-you-miss-it climax on a plane. Both ""Octopussy"" and ""The Living Daylights"" had better plane climaxes.Performance wise, Sean Connery is a good actor, but not that good of a Bond. Let's face the fact that Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan were all better. The other actors are adequate. The standout is Honor Blackman as the cold-hearted bitch we love to hate. Too bad about the character rape at the end.It's not all bad, though. It certainly has a better pace than the one before it and the one after it, but it certainly gets on one's nerves at times, especially at the horrible laser scene (""No Mister Bond, I except you to die"" -- how pathetic).",Goldfinger
284,uroshnor54,Not the Best Bond but Still Pretty Good,7,19 September 2014,"The best Bond movie is The Spy Who Loved Me, in my opinion. Goldfinger is also pretty good, though. There are quite a few exciting moments, like the car chases and the laser scene. And the corpse of Shirley Eaton covered in gold paint is a memorable image. But some parts could have been far better. The fight between Bond and Oddjob, for instance. It felt pretty subdued rather than thrilling, which it should have been. Oddjob just throws Bond around and doesn't even try to snap his neck (he probably could have succeeded if he tried). Honestly the whole climax of the movie could have been done better. I mean, Goldfinger says there are 41,000 troops stationed around Fort Knox. So where are they? After they get the message that the atomic bomb has been delivered, we see only fifteen at Fort Knox.Also, it doesn't make much sense that when Bond lied about knowing about Operation Grand Slam, Goldfinger didn't even ask him to elaborate a bit on it to find out if he was telling the truth. Still, it's better than what happened in the book, where Goldfinger just decides to make Bond his secretary instead of killing him, even though Bond didn't say anything about Operation Grand Slam. So it's definitely worth seeing but I just don't agree with everyone else that it's the best Bond film. It's not even the best of Sean Connery's Bond films (that would probably be Thunderball).",Goldfinger

Cec Linder played Felix in this one, and did a good job. Honor Blackman was good as Pussy galore. Don't want to give away too much.

286,Dock-Ock,The Midas Touch : Pure Gold,9,24 September 2001,"Goldfinger is one of the most enjoyable, boys own/comic book style adventure movies ever to be made. It has a fantastic script by Paul Diehn and Richard Maibaum, excellent Direction from Guy Hamilton, Fantastic acting by the three leads [Sean Connery, Honour Blackman and Gert Frobe] and some of the most inspired action set pieces to appear on the big screen. In Bond terms it also has a fine score by John Barry, one of the most instantly recognisable Title songs sung by Shirley Bassey, the beautifull Golden Girl, Shirley Eaton and Bonds most Famous henchman : Oddjob, Harold Sakata.By now you probably realise iam a fan. Well. as it goes i find it almost impossible to watch the first two Connery Bonds, because i was brought up on a diet of 70's and 80's escapism, with fun, humour action and thrills in every scene. Well, i didn't have to look much further than Goldfinger than that.The Opening pre Credits sequence sets the scene. Any film in wich its lead actor can strip away a wet suit to reveal a Tuxedo, is obviously having fun with itself. Or to be presise, Guy Hamilton is having fun. With the help of Broccoli, Saltzman, Maibaum and Ken Adam, Guy Hamilton set the blue prints for action movies for, perhaps forever. Sean Connery is very much the Superhero in this outing, and that is after all as we like him. He is having the time of his life with this movie and it shows, this is perhaps his bset performance as Bond. There is also Honour Blackman, very much a role model for Action Heroines for years to come as Pussy Galore. Galores lesbian undertones are toned down from the way they were in the book, but she is sexy and full to bursting with womens Lib. Gert Frobe is fantastic as Goldfinger, very chilling .""No Mr Bond i expect you to Die"" has gone down in cinematic history and it is atestament to the man who dubbed Frobe!The real star of the show is Ken Adam. His sets are fantastic. I have never seen Fort Knox, and i dont want to because i have seen it in Goldfinger. Adam is a genius, as are Peter and Michael Lamont who helped him out with the sets. Add to all this the Aston Martin with Ejector Seat and Revolving Licence Plate and more, A Hawaian henchman who throws his blade laced Bowler hat, a girl killed by suffication due to being painted Gold, and THAT Lazer between the legs. What you have got is pure unadulterated Comic Book fun. Even if you dont like Comic Books, you will love Goldfinger.",Goldfinger

I like the scenes of the swinging sixties (1964) even though I wasn't born at the time and these are now nearly difficult to recreate and I love the film locations like Switzerland and the USA. The arch villain in the film is Mr Goldfinger after the title of the film and novel brilliantly played by a German actor along with a Chinese henchman called Oddjob. The film does have some weaknesses and its a bit heavy on the plot in some places. It is worth saying a word about the man whom created James Bond, Ian Fleming on what is the fact that he had only lived to see two films based on his creation but suffered from a fatal heart attack shortly before the release of this third Bond film. He was just 56 years old. Even so, more than forty years after his death with the year 2008 marking the centenary of his birth, the culture of Fleming's creation continues to remain popular on film but for how much longer can it go on and should they put it aside to gather dust?

Sean Connery will always be the best Bond, and not due to nostalgia. Although this was the 3rd Bond film, it was the first with wide release and abundant viewership, so it was the 1st for most people. The combination of a believable plot, believable gadgets, excellent acting, beautiful women, etc., etc., makes this the best Bond film by anyone's measure. The only flaw that has always bothered me (except when I was 7 :) ), is when the planes fly over and the troops on the ground immediately react, but I guess that could be explained by not having them properly informed about the relationship between a planes height and the time for something released by a plane to reach the ground :) Anyway, I don't think anyone is going to read an IMDB review before watching this, because I think everyone has seen it!

294,unbend_5440,Goldfinger,10,3 April 2004,"I often wonder if Guy Hamilton was just lucky with Goldfinger. He had to fill the shoes of Terence Young as Director, he had to make a movie that was probably twice the budget of the previous two movies, and he had countless other expectations, yet he still managed to make this the most entertaining and popular Bond movie of all time. Now here's my question about him being lucky. How come he couldn't rescue Diamonds Are Forever and Live & Let Die from turning into a mindless parody of this! Hamilton demonstrated unbelievable talent in Goldfinger, so what went wrong with his later movies in this franchise? I'll never understand why Hamilton brought so much magic to Goldfinger, but could never achieve that again. Anyways, I'll save my ranting for my later reviews. This ushered in the era of Camp to Bond. The humor is heightened, and the story has a much lighter tone than the first 2 movies. I'll now write about some of the common elements used in all Bond movies.BOND- This should be the text book example for any actor to play Bond from this point forward. Sean Connery nailed in Goldfinger everything that makes up the character. His sense of humor, his style, his laid back coolness, his aggression and attitude, his charm and charisma. Connery for the first time comes off completely settled into the character. In Goldfinger, Sean Connery IS James Bond. And more so than in any of his other movies, Connery seems to enjoy what he's doing.VILLAIN- Auric Goldfinger may be the smartest villain Bond has ever faced. He's smart because he always makes the most rational decision. Goldfinger doesn't carry a personal vendetta against anyone. He doesn't want to rule the world, just become more powerful than he is. Everything Goldfinger does makes sense if you're a crazy criminal madman. Gert Frobe gets a lot of praise for his performance, which he really shouldn't because all of his lines are dubbed by another actor. While redubbing dialogue doesn't work in most cases, with Goldfinger something goes right. He has an incredibly amusing personality to watch.HENCHMAN- Oddjob is the greatest Henchman this series has ever featured. He never says a line, but he cuts people's heads off with his bowler hat, and he crushes golf balls with his bare hands. I know that sounds dumb, but you have to see it to understand the appeal of Oddjob. Actually, seeing it won't make a difference. I have no idea what the appeal of Oddjob is. He just rules.THE FIGHT- There was a time when fight scenes were realistic. Meaning that if you have a huge monster of a badguy (Oddjob) against a sophisticated british guy, the badguy would dominate the fight and nothing the goodguy could do would inflict any pain on the badguy. Of course Oddjob is stronger than Bond, and the fight scene is filmed that way. In classic Bond fashion, Bond wins using his wits, not his strength.FINAL ACTION SEQUENCE- Give the credit to Ken Adam's brilliant set of Fort Knox. The setting of this final action sequence is the highlight, not so much the action itself. However this was the first time they went all out with dozens of soldiers fighting dozens of soldiers. But with all the guns and action here, the best moment is the final seconds on the Nuke.Final Comments. This is the movie when the gadgets became important. Yes, the Aston Martin is a little over-the-top, but that's what this movie is all about. The theme has powerful vocals and it's a great song. The guy that played Felix Leiter did not have the personality he needed. And some may say that the campyness was too much to handle, but I think it's handled right for the first and last time in Goldfinger. Being a fun and entertaining blockbuster is just what was needed to follow up the previous two movies. It's so easy to see why Goldfinger is the most popular Bond of all time, because it really is one of the very best.",Goldfinger
295,rneil95,The Definitive James Bond Film,9,2 November 2013,"If ""Dr. No"" established the formula, and ""From Russia with Love"" improved it, then ""Goldfinger"" perfected it! This third film in the franchise is often the first one people think of when they think of James Bond. It's got everything you could want from a Bond film, it's got the action, the women, the gadgets, the villain, every finite detail of the formula is perfected here. This time around, the film is directed by Guy Hamilton, who does a fantastic job in retaining the style of the series, even though it's not as serious as ""From Russia with Love."" The film opens with a high-octane bit of action to set the tone for the rest of the film. It's an unrelated mission with no ties to the rest of the plot, but it's great in the way it establishes Bond's character immediately, dropping you right in on the action. It's a great way to set up these films in the pre-credit sequence, which then leads into one of the most well-known Bond title songs, Shirley Bassey's ""Goldfinger,"" and deservedly so. It's one of the coolest openings to a film, establishing everything you need to know about what to expect for the rest of the movie.From there, the film's main plot kicks in, with Bond investigating the criminal activities of a man named Auric Goldfinger (Gert Fröbe), a man plotting to upset the world economy by contaminating the gold supply at Fort Knox. As I've said before, this film has everything you could want from a Bond film. Goldfinger is a brilliantly maniacal villain, and he plays off Connery brilliantly. Honor Blackman's Pussy Galore is one of the most memorable Bond girls, even if her character can come across as sexist. Blackman still does a great job in spite of some of these more uncomfortable scenes, and holds her own against the rest of the cast. We also get the classic MI6 scenes with Bernard Lee's M and Lois Maxwell's Moneypenny, as well as our first proper Q branch scene, with Desmond Llewelyn's Q presenting the assortment of gadgets that Bond would use, most notably the tricked out Aston Martin DB5 that has since become THE car associated with the series, and deservedly so. It's beautiful, and the way Bond makes use of the gadgets are so much fun.This film also has what is probably Sean Connery's best performance as Bond. All the qualities he's established in the prior films are still there, but his suave swagger is perfected here. The standout moment of the film for me is the laser sequence, with the classic lines: ""Do you expect me to talk?"" ""No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!"" Even though this sequence has been parodied to death, it hasn't lost any of its intensity, and that's really down to Connery's performance. It doesn't happen often, but in this moment, Bond shows fear, and that's what elevates this performance. His uncertainty in this situation makes Connery's Bond feel genuine, giving a certain level of humanity to the role. We also get another great fight sequence at the end of the film, this time between Bond and the mute henchman Oddjob (Harold Sakata) in Fort Knox. It's a great fight scene, equaling the fight between Bond and Red Grant in ""From Russia with Love."" It's hard to find things to say about ""Goldfinger"" that haven't already been said. It's the most iconic James Bond film, and with good reason. If you were to introduce someone new to the franchise, someone who wasn't familiar with Bond, this would probably be the film you'd show them. It covers so much ground in terms of defining what Bond is, and does it all so well. The action, the characters, the plot, the memorable gadgets, it's the definitive Bond film in nearly every way.",Goldfinger
296,DMP-2,The movie that made James Bond the best action film series,7,10 December 2000,"To many this film had it all. I agree it is excellent, but not the best film, its the #3. I think Thunderball (1965), The Living Daylights (1987) are better, and The Spy Who Loved Me(1977) falls behind as #4. This film had the series best villains, Auric Goldfinger and Odd Job. Odd Job is almost better than Goldfinger, he set the standard for later Bond films. He created Tee-Hee (Live And Let Die(1973) which created the excellent character of Jaws (The Spy Who Loved Me (1977)& Moonraker (1979). Pussy Galore another excellnt Bond girl and who can forget the girl covered in gold paint, Jill Masterson. And there is also the forgotten Bond girl Tilly Masterson. This is a landmark, it allowed Bond films to be the great films they are today.",Goldfinger
297,rutherfordh-81993,Classic,9,16 October 2020,"Goldfinger is one of the very best Bond films there are, and probably the best of all of Sean Connery's. The classic action and gadgets are all in it, and there is a suitable amount of humour. Sean Connery, Honor Blackman and Gert Frobe are all great. It is fairly truthful to the book, but there are some good differences. Locations such as the USA and Switzerland are both very strong too. Overall, it is one of the best Bond films, and certainly worth watching.",Goldfinger
298,mattymatt30,"The most famous Bond film, but almost deserves the finger",7,15 March 2004,"Goldfinger made the Bond films a worldwide phenomenon, but the film itself is so full of holes it's like swiss cheese. Goldfinger is extremely stylish,with gadgets galore(pun), and the famous tricked-out Aston-Martin, but that doesn't mean its flaws don't count.  SPOILERS AHEAD: Fundamental parts of the plot don't make sense, such as the scene where Goldfinger is explaining his 'Project Grandslam' to the gangsters. Even the dvd commentary says this scene is simply to further the story and to explain Goldfinger's plan to the viewer! Also, the one gangster that wants to be paid in gold and leave, gets shot and crushed in a brand new Lincoln Continental along with the gold.  WHY?! There are so many inaccuracies with this scene that I can't even go into them all.  Perhaps the greatest flawed scene is when the airplanes gas the Fort Knox area.  All the people fall to the ground faster than if they were hit by an atom bomb, even faster than the gangsters died from the gas in a closed room! To even stretch credibility further, if even one person was seen to move in the slightest way by any of Goldfinger's gang, the gig would be up.  Are thousands of soldiers that good at keeping secrets and playing dead?  In closing, the flaws in Goldfinger are too numerous to list. With most films, that would ruin the movie entirely, but Goldfinger has so much else going for it that it just plows ahead, flaws and all. Fun film, campy, not very serious, and not the best Bond film.",Goldfinger
299,happytoms,The legendary Aston Martin and Goldfinger.,10,5 August 2019,"It's the movie where the legendary Aston Martin is introduced with Oddjob and Goldfinger. It's filled with iconic scenes,characters and just has more of everything.James Bond is back and he's on another mission to save the world.
It's the classic James Bond formula, but more refined.
More bad guys, action, one liners, more gadgets, chases, girls, cars exploding for no reason and everything you would except from a Bond movie. It takes place around the world and it's exciting.It's the original time capsule for anyone who wants to go back to the early days to understand Bond better and watch how the movie series began and evolved over time.The story is as cliché as you would expect from a Bond movie, but it's not a bad thing at all and it's very enjoyable even after all these years.
Cliché story, music, effects and the amazing 1960s vibe works extremely well.This feels like the most refined out of the early Bond movies and personally I liked it the most. And would 100% reccomend to anyone familiar or not with the Bond franchise.",Goldfinger
300,Tunica,Great Early James Bond film,8,1 June 1999,"I believe this was the second film in the series, and it was the one whose popularity really sent the James Bond phenomenon into orbit. Admittedly, it doesn't benefit from the technology of 1999. Still, if you bear in mind that it's bells and whistles were extraordinary for 1964, you should be able to adjust your mindset. I might also point out that, because we weren't so tech driven back then, the story still was expected to drive a movie, and the plot of ""Goldfinger"" remains delightful escapist entertainment.",Goldfinger
301,sterlinrivera-2000,My Favorite James Bond Film Ever,10,3 January 2020,"Goldfinger is without a doubt my favorite James Bond film ever, and one of my favorite movies of all time period. It is truly spectacular from start to finish, and remains to be an immortal classic.Goldfinger is about a powerful man known as Auric Goldfinger (Gert Fröbe) hatches a plan to raid Fort Knox and demolish the world economy. James Bond (Sean Connery) must stop his plan and use his brand new Aston Martin car to take out the bad guys.Such an excellent film. It's story is easily the best, straightforward, and clever out of all the Bond films, the pacing was incredibly fast, and this was really the first Bond film to have high scale action. The first two were the beginning, but this is where action kicks in and is outstanding.The acting in this one is also the best. Easily Sean Connery's greatest performance and his best movie ever. Gert Fröbe was awesome as Goldfinger as well. The new Bond girl, Pussy Galore, isn't my favorite Bond girl, but she was still amazing, and Honor Blackman was very suitable for the role.One last thing is this is the film that introduces the Aston Martin car, and it truly makes the film shine with all the cool gadgets it has and the tricks it can do. Probably my favorite gadget that James Bond gets to have.Overall, I love Goldfinger. It always has and always will be my number one favorite Bond film. I don't think anything can beat it.",Goldfinger
302,tonynworah,Pure Vintage Bond,8,21 July 2011,"""Do you expect me to talk?"" ""No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!"" With that classic comeback, Gert Frobe launched himself as one of Bond's most memorable villains, Goldfinger, which was the movie's title name.This was third Sean Connery's third entrance as debonair British Agent James Bond 007, following the runaway successes of the previous entries, Dr.No and From Russia With Love.Returning from a mission in Mexico where he blows up a crate filled with banana flavoured heroin, he makes a transit stop at Miami and receives instructions to place Auric Goldfinger under observation. Typical of Bond, he gets entangled with Goldfinger's woman, Jill Masterton, played by the bombshell sex kitten Shirley Easton and sabotages Goldfinger's crooked card game. Goldfinger's response leaves unpleasant circumstances especially for the delectable Jill whom, in one of the movie's most iconic scenes, Bond finds dead covered with gold paint.Bond is now dispatched to follow Goldfinger and find evidence of his supposed gold smuggling. In the process, he comes across a female sniper who has her own reason for wanting to kill Goldfinger , Goldfinger's killing machine, Oddjob, a Korean with a bowler hat that can cut off the head of a statue, and Goldfinger's lesbian pilot Pussy Galore(Yikes!) played by Avenger girl Honor Blackman.What started as a simple gold smuggling operation evolves to become a daring operation to break into US's Gold bullion depository in Fort Knox.For many Bond fans, the appeal of Goldfinger is almost universal. It was the vintage movie that started the Bond formula. The violent pre credit openings, title credits showing silhouettes or statues of naked women, the gadgets, the grand masterplan to dominate the world.Connery's confidence shows in the movie. Afterall, he had navigated the two previous entries to solid commercial successes. At 34, he was still top form, and his performance was top notch. Gert Frobe who plays the megalomaniac Goldfinger was outstanding in his performance. Almost nazi like in his posturing and his clipped accent, his acting shows why he is regarded as one of the most memorable villains in movie history. From the moment he engages Bond in a game of golf and warns the latter not to interfere with his business, to the scene where he has Bond strapped onto an operation table and tortures him with a laser saw that can cut through solid steel, from the part where he delivers his captivating crime speech to several mob bosses, (""Man has climbed Mount Everest, gone to the bottom of the ocean. He's fired rockets at the Moon, split the atom, achieved miracles in every field of human endeavor... except crime!"")to his revealing the true operation to Bond, Gert Frobe easily stole every scene that he appeared in.His performance was nearly matched by Harold Sakata, who plays Oddjob. Sakata never utters a word, but his physical menace is seen throughout the movie. Never again has a Bond henchman acquired a cult status as Oddjob, with the possible exception of Richard Kiel's Jaws (whose later comic interpretations robbed him of his menace).Naturally there was a bevy of beauties, but none came close to Shirley Easton. Her opening scene with Bond, wearing black underwear and swinging her leg in a bored sexy fashion as she spies on Goldfinger's game was outstanding. I remember how we cheered in delight when Connery introduces himself to Easton in his trademark fashion, ""Bond, James Bond"" accompanied by John Barry's thrilling Bond theme.All the Bond regulars were present, Bernard Lee as ""M"", Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny, and Desmond Llewelyn as Q. Llewelyn who had earlier made his debut in From Russia With Love, had his role expanded and established in Goldfinger. And why not? After all he was the one who handed over one of world's most famous cars to Bond, the Astor Martin a car with enough gadgets to destroy a battalion. His scenes with Connery were simply hilarious and established the trend in the following movies.Guy Hamilton did a masterful directing job here. While the film may not be action packed like the other Bond movies (and even so, the action is tame even by those day's standards), Hamilton kept the movie tightly paced with excitement and breathless suspense. Only the golf scene, may seem to drag a little but the rest of the movie was top notch.Hamilton a much as possible stuck to Ian Fleming's novel however with some noticeable difference. In the novel, Bond killed the Mexican hit-man in the streets with his hand and not by electrocution in the room of a cabaret dancer. Bond's first encounter with Goldfinger was on the request of an old acquaintance from the past, a rich fellow named Dupont who suspects that Goldfinger was cheating him in a game of Canasta. In the movie, it was on the instructions of M. In the book, Bond never saw the death of Jill Masterton but heard of it from her vengeful sister. The most outstanding difference was the operations itself. In the book, Goldfinger's plan was to poison the city's water supply and then proceed to cart away the gold from Fort Knox. However critics scoffed at the sheer physical improbability of removing all the gold bullion within a limited time frame as espoused by Fleming.As a result of the criticism the book faced, Hamilton and his screenwriters ingeniously changed the operation to become more sophisticated, more daring and more diabolical.Hamilton's improvisation while as incredulous as Fleming's was more exciting and heart pounding.Goldfinger is a treasure and pure vintage Bond!",Goldfinger
303,mikavir,The best Bond movie of all time,10,18 July 2019,"Genuine and original James Bond actor Sean Connery in his best 007 movie is doing very well as 007 in this classic film. A villain of movie is one of the best in Bond history. Especially a scene where Goldfinger says Bond: ""I expect you to die, Mr Bond."" A plot is exciting. Operation Fort Knox is an inventive idea from scriptwriters. Oddjob is a memorable henchman with his dangerous hat. Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore succeeds to be the best Bond girl in 60s Bonds.If you want to see a good Bond movie so watch this one.",Goldfinger

305,CosmicDwellings,Fantastical!,9,13 January 2001,"The third Bond movie and one of the best-loved and most respected features in the series. Sean is wonderful as he fits into the role securely in this one along with the series penchant for gadgets (who could forget that ejector seat?) and beautiful women.Great script with a great cast including the lovable Gert Frobe as one of the most memorable 'Bond Baddies'- Auric Goldfinger. The scene with the laser is great 'edge of the seat' stuff. Who could also forget henchman 'Oddjob' with his killer bowler hat!Some of the favourite Bond girls are in this one in the form of Honor Blackman and Shirley Eaton. You can also see a good vengeful performance by Blackpool-born actress Tania Mallet as 'Tilly' and also, in a bit part is the future 'Carry On' star with finely-tuned lines-Margaret Nolan as 'Dink' (she is also the 'Golden Girl' who appears in the opening titles sequence).This film also boasts one of the favourite Bond hit theme songs as chanted by the immortal voice of Shirley Bassey (the first of her three Bond themes).It's all made of great stuff and certainly a blueprint for most of the future Bond movies...Enjoy!",Goldfinger
306,bock_g,The Bond that's way beyond.,7,18 November 2010,"Goldfinger (1964) is one of the most Favorited Bond films amongst fans and critics alike. This film set the standard for the spy-fantasy thrillers and had launched a wave of goofy spy parodies during that decade. I would have to admit, when I watched this for the first time when I was eight, I was jumping out of my couch excited. When I watched this film again yesterday, I felt as though if I were watching a horrible 90's action flick. The film was just so cheesy and over-dependent on gadgets that were out of question and had a ridiculous plot. I would give this film credit for it's clear depiction of it's period setting, the attractive girl who was painted gold, and some memorable one-liners. The film score was barely memorable,(as the title song was just annoying as hell) the main Bond girl looked like a grandma, and the villain seemed like one of those fat security guards that sleeps all day. I understand that the Bond films are a spy-fantasy, but I think there should be a line between the fantasy and reality. The fantasy in this film is clearly the Aston Martin DB5 (As if James Bond gambling, traveling first class, and having fun with hot chicks is not fantasizing enough). There's just a real lack of sophistication in the plot and gadgets unlike the previous film, From Russia With Love (1963). If you want a Bond film with gadgets, hot chicks, and a more decent story line, watch The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). Goldfinger is the most overrated Bond film of all time.",Goldfinger
307,jonny_mcclatch,One of the best Bond films.,9,12 June 2019,"Okay, slightly controversial opinion... this isn't my all time favourite Bond film. I still rate it very highly, it has great locations, great action scenes, great sets and really defines the franchise. Oddjob is definitely the best henchmen, Pussy Galore is a great Bond girl, Goldfinger is a little underwhelming. The main villain is somewhat outshone by his counterparts, his plan makes some sense but at the same time is ridiculously elaborate for a fairly simple goal.The film builds on what the previous two films had mapped out, the gadgets and henchmen become very unique to the Bond franchise. On top of that we have a different style of Bond girl in Shirley Eaton who only makes a short appearance but a very lasting impression as Jill Masterson. It also introduces Bond's car, indirectly enforcing Q's role in the series along with it. This is a definite turning point for Bond, everything became larger in scale after Goldfinger it set a benchmark for everything Bond.",Goldfinger
308,tomasg-69814,First Complete Bond.,9,3 January 2016,"And the formula - at last - fell into place. The 007 crew made things fit like a glove. The era for the JB-movies as the audience have seen them for over 50 years, began. Full, dramatic opening scene. A classic theme performed by a world-wide famous artist, backed up by innovative images behind the opening credits. The gadgets and the cars. Sean Connery in full bloom as James Bond. A handful of beautiful women passing by, on the way to a thrilling grand final. Yes, it's all there. Critics may accuse me for praising this movie a little too much, but I find it as fundamental as I attend to, in comparison to - in first - Connery's other Bond's. And as budget increased huge after this success, none ( I think ) thought that forthcoming movies would disappoint anyone. There were still some movie history to be made in the future.",Goldfinger

311,passenger70,Going for Gold,10,3 November 2020,There is a famous theory that Indiana Jones plays no part in the outcome of Raiders of the Lost Ark and it could equally be argued that Bond plays no part in the outcome of this film. He spends the second half of the film hanging around at Goldfinger's pleasure and it is never really explained why Pussy Galore decides to betray Goldfinger and assist the CIA in foiling his plan. The army could have taken out Oddjob themselves and Bond doesn't even defuse the bomb at the end as an expert pushes him out of the way at the last moment. But what this film really does is set the tone for the Bond series here on out and arguably for popular entertainment itself for the rest of the sixties. It features so many iconic scenes and ideas that it has cemented James Bond as a film icon for all time.,Goldfinger
312,ppilf,"Sean Connery is, and remains, the one and only James Bond",8,30 May 2019,"I still enjoy 'Goldfinger' most of all the James Bond movies (along with 'From Russia with Love') although I'm not a big James Bond movie fan because they can be quite absurd. But I must admit that the combination of Sean Connery, the exciting unique music, the international settings, the gadgets and special effects, and the production quality of the original Broccoli 007 films ranks as one of the biggest hit phenomena in film history to this day. Although their story plots could get a bit far-fetched, the films had a very exciting unique style of intrigue that made them super appealing and exciting to watch. They were 'bigger than life'. And I doubt if anyone will ever fully match Sean Connery's awesome suave screen presence in that role. To me the one who comes closest is Daniel Craig. But, again, Sean Connery is, and remains, the one and only James Bond.",Goldfinger
313,mbruce007,Worth its weight in gold...,8,6 October 2020,"Directed by Guy Hamilton, Goldfinger was the film that started the so-called James Bond phenomenon and catapulted Sean Connery to super-stardom. The film begins with Connery swimming stealthily behind some dark warehouse, with nothing but a dark wetsuit and an artificial duck on his head, for camouflage.After subduing a few guards, Connery makes his way through a trap door to a lab containing a considerable amount of heroin. On his escape, he sophisticatedly changes into a pristine white dinner suit and an explosive charge set by him blows the drug consignment to hell while he soothes himself dragging on a Benson And Hedges.He returns to his hotel room to find some little darling carrying out her ablutions in his bathtub. Following a romantic gesture between them, Bond finds himself rudely interrupted by an assassin and, after a short tussle, Bond electrocutes the assassin in said bathtub, with which Connery delivers that immortal line, ""Shocking, Positively Shocking"".The scene ends abruptly and we are brought into the dazzling black and gold opening titles over which is played the timeless, sexy, jazzy Goldfinger theme by John Barry, with vocals sung by the inimitable Shirley Bassey.After some holidaying pre-amble in Miami, the film finally gets under way when Bond finds his love interest, Jill Masterson, lying dead on a hotel bed covered head to toe in gold paint, an image which would become as iconic as the film itself. The man behind her death turns out to be extortionist, Auric Goldfinger, played by Gert Frobe, who is basically like Santa Clause gone rogue and sans beard. Goldfinger is someone who, as the name suggests, just bloody loves gold.Bond hunts down Goldfinger who it transpires, with the aid of his henchman, is planning to raid Fort Knox, and obliterate the world economy. There are many iconic scenes in this film including great chase sequences in Bond's iconic, gadget-laden Aston Martin DB5, the introduction of a tough female counterpart to Bond in the infamously named Pussy Galore, captain of an all-female flying fleet.Goldfinger is the first film which inspired a collector's market for James Bond memorabilia with the selling of James Bond-branded toys, clothes, games and drinks. The most famous product was imaginably the Corgi Aston Martin DB5 diecast model, which was famously originally painted gold and not the silver of the film's model.",Goldfinger
314,d-apergis,the essence of cool cinema,8,20 December 2009,"Sadly, the hard edge of the first two installments in the series has given way to a less harmful and more popularized texture here, but this is undeniably the essence of cool cinema. Done with flair and style, it goes through the motions with a lively sophistication, presenting each deadly situation with its tongue firmly in cheek. Connery is smooth, Frobe is an amusing villain and Harold Sakata has achieved iconic status as henchman Oddjob. Jill Masterson's ""golden corpse"" is one of the eeriest and most psychedelic depictions of death to ever grace the screen. A classic, although I cannot fail to point out the fact that Bond gets knocked unconscious a worrying three times.",Goldfinger
315,Ken-120,A film that is superior to the original book,9,7 June 2000,"Most people complain on how filmed adaptions are never as good as the original books for the changes they make.  Well, this film is a big exception to that.  In the book, Goldfinger is out to actually steal the gold, which the movie James Bond points out is a kind of operation that cannot be done profitably in the short amount of time he would have before the US military moves to stop him.  Even more absurd, Goldfinger plans to gain access to the vault using a small nuclear bomb to blow open a door with everyone less than a kilometer away.Compare this to the movie, which has Goldfinger planning to contaminate the gold in Fort Knox which can be done within the expected 2 hours he would have after he gasses the personel of the fort.  Furthermore, he gains entry using the powerful industrial laser he has to cut through the door.In short, the plot of the film is much more believable and reasonable. Combine this with the other good elements, like the actors, characters and gadgets that have aged so well, then you have a film is definately one of the best action films of all time.",Goldfinger
316,spinin,Still the best Bond film after all this time,9,24 June 2021,"James Bond (Sean Connery) goes after a suspicious gold-smuggling entrepreneur, Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe). As he encounters several women along the way, he will need all the help from them he can get if he is to stop Goldfinger's ingenious plot to get rich, while destroying the western economy.This is the Bond film where all of the pieces from the first two films come together. Everything that the Bond films would become is done here first. The outrageous villain, his mastermind plot, an unstoppable henchman, the numerous memorable Bond girls on different sides of the battle, the ever growing build up to a huge finale, and Bond at his most suave and pulling out all the stops to prevent his arch-enemy from succeeding.I grew up on Roger Moore films and I love several of them, so this was not my personal favorite right off the bat. It wasn't the first Sean Connery film that I saw, but over time, it has grown on me and at this point I can say that it is the best Bond movie and my favorite as well. It is the type of movie that I could watch all the way through, if I randomly caught it on TV. It is polished, entertaining, well-plotted, and it is remarkably rewatchable. Some of the technology and backscreen projection doesn't look great, and a few moments in the plot involving some of the characters are implausible, but those are small moments in the film and really the only things I can nitpick.I love the character of Goldfinger. He is a likeable villain and larger-than-life, without being completely unbelievable. He enjoys the finer things in life, is smart, and I love how this movie paints him as a cheat. The moments where he cheats at cards and later at a round of golf with Bond, are just such great touches. The entire golf game with him and Bond is so memorable as Bond gets to one-up him with some giddy and brave tactics. He is frequently dismissive of Bond throughout the film, which really strengthens him as a character. And his plot actually makes sense. It is one of the most foolproof villain plots in all of the Bond films, especially compared to so many ridiculous ones.Sean Connery is at his absolute best here. He is on point and present throughout the entire film. He is more charming, more amusing, and more suave than in any other Bond film. He is having as much fun here as in any other movie in the series, except maybe the often ridiculous Diamonds are Forever. A lot of people in the Bond fan community frequently bring up that he spends a lot of the film in captivity and at Goldfinger's will. While that is true, I also think that this is why Connery is good here. You get to see Bond figure his way out throughout the film, much like us, the viewers. He has to use his charm and cleverness rather than just brute force or calculated logic to stop Goldfinger. And I love how the two actually befriend each other. There is a sense of actual friendship in many moments, despite the fact that business for each one will come first. They genuinely seem to enjoy each other's company and the chess match they are both playing.Finally, there are just so many iconic and memorable scenes. The indestructable hat-throwing henchman Oddjob paved the way for so many other henchmen that followed in the Bond series. His final battle with Bond at Fort Knox again pushes Bond against the ropes to the max. There's Pussy Galore, the Bond Girl that Bond needs to win over. The two Masterson sisters, each with a different character, both tied to Goldfinger and both greatly affected by Bond quite tragically. They become the Bond girls that Bond cannot save, casualties along the way, which would also become a frequent staple in the films. The music is so memorable. The film has a great pre-title sequence that culminates with the ""shocking!"" Bond one-liner. And the iconic ""Do you expect me to talk?"", ""No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!"" scene is now legendary.Goldfinger really flows from one memorable scene to the next and is just littered with iconic moments. Simply put, it is fun, with very few flaws, and is so watchable that any flaws that it does have, I see myself dismissing simply because I enjoy the experience of watching it so much.",Goldfinger
317,jackhamel1987,The Iconic Bond,9,7 April 2013,"Goldfinger is simply the most iconic of the James Bond films. This was the first to have the gadgets, the first to have 2-3 Bond girls, the first to have the most insane, over-reaching plot and as such set the ultimate standard for total Bond escapism. It has absolutely everything in it, including some of the most iconic Bond lines, and some fabulous set pieces and multiple world locations. And it has a fabulous title song by Shirley Bassey, instantly recognizable almost anywhere in the world.The British and American governments suspect jeweler and tycoon Auric Goldfinger of illegally smuggling gold through the borders in Europe, which in turn damages the value of the currencies which are cheated. James Bond is brought in to investigate, but following the death of Bond girl Jill Masterson(surely the most iconic Bond girl death), he takes it a bit more personally and sets about trying to unravel Goldfinger's plot, discovering that Goldfinger might in fact have an even more devious and insane plan involving a 'small nuclear device' and a rather famous Fort in America. Along the way, he meets Jill's sister Tilly (another ill-fated Bond girl, extremely loyal henchman Odd-Job, and of course, Pussy Galore (fabulously acted by Honer Blackman). Natually, this leads to the most iconic battle between Bond and the super-villain, and being a Bond film it can only end one way. Of all the James Bond films, this has to be the most iconic, even if it's not the best in terms of plot. ""No, Mr Bond, I expect you to die!"" - An instant classic, that has been parodied so many times over the years, that it's amazing that it still has any power left! Not to mention the wonderfully names ""Pussy Galore"" (God knows how they got away with that one), Odd-Job as the definitive henchman, and the Aston Martin DB5, which is now such a classic that it's one of the few cars that appreciates in value, rather than depreciates. And of course, Gert Frobe as Auric Goldfinger, the first genuine super-villain with a genuinely insane yet ingenious plan. Sean Connery absolutely cemented himself as the definitive Bond in this film, and with this, the role of Bond changed from Detective/spy to more of a super-spy with the class, the wit and the gadgets to confront any situation. You know the situations that Bond is in, simply don't make sense - yet Connery and the film itself handles it all so brilliantly, that somehow insane situations are made to feel very sane and believable. Odd-Job, the least likely henchman, is now the most iconic henchman simply because of that hat! Goldfinger has the most famous line of any Bond villain, and Honer Blackman surely has the best Bond girl name of all. It's such a classic, that nearly every other spy film/franchise since from film, to TV has in some way parodied it. Even Mike Myers ripped this off for Austin Powers. And let's not forget that ejector seat.Though the Bond franchise has tried very, very hard to match the sheer class of this film and the characters in it, no one has ever really managed it. No one ever will. The plot may not be as strong as From Russia with Love, but in my opinion, this is the definitive James Bond film, and should never, ever be missed.",Goldfinger
318,carl170,re: Just Brilliant,10,17 October 2005,"This was the 1960's, and for once just once, and only Once this was England's finest decade in the 20th Century. It was so cool to say that you came from England, at this time.From Twiggy, to the Rolling Stones, from Aston Martin DB5 to the Mini Cooper, from Mini Skirts to the Fab Four(*The Beatles), and from winning the World Cup to finally to James Bond...It was all happening on this tiny Island...This film put England on the world map, or least allowed people to focus on England again. More people did that then they realised. I think it was the Car that did it. The Aston Martin DB5. You read about Cars like this in Comic magazines, but to see them appear on screen....THe DB5 made the comapny of Aston Martin gain worldwide status for the British Car Company.Doctor No made James Bond an International hero. But this film of ""Goldfinger"" elevated him him a worldwide cult...or Hero even!The only car that could match James Bond's one at the time was Batman's...(*from the same decade - on screen of course!) But what made this really was this was a man that you could see believe that could really exist.He dressed immaculately, could fight, was a magnet to all the girls/women that he seemed to meet. Always seemed to ""book"" into SOME finest Hotels. And managed always to stay one step ahead of the bad guys. And was intelligent to go with it.It was also the first time that ""Q"" came into full play. And told the fidgeting Bond to, ""Pay attention 007"" As he was trying to explain a gadget (which he would eventually use in his mission!) I also liked the way that ""M"" put him in his place if he got too cocky.The immortal line of ""Do you expect me to talk Goldfinger"".. No I expect you to die Mr Bond"" replies Goldfinger should be written down as one of the greatest Movie lines in history.And as for the name Pussy Galore...It just gets better, and better Great Spy film..action, action and action.Carl Brown - Ipswich, England",Goldfinger
319,chancey-23,Easily the best Bond film,10,15 July 2012,"Sean Connery is back as James Bond in this early Bond film, the third in the series, and it has remained to this very day the very best of the bunch. What a great film, and it all goes back, perhaps, to the villain of the piece, Auric Goldfinger, easily the best villain Bond goes up against. From start to finish, the film has a quick pace that is defined by the way you see an action scene, then it seems five minutes later there's another one when in fact it's been about twenty. The film's major success, as I mentioned before, is the villain played by Gert Frobe. Auric Goldfinger has got to go down as the best Bond villain of all time. His scheme is genius, his threatening of 007 is thrilling, and his acting proves that when a good actor takes on the role, you can have a successful Bond film. I can't do the film justice in a quick review like this, but I think everyone agrees. Or they should.",Goldfinger
320,MondoMirth,Hat Trick,7,3 January 2020,"Without a doubt the most iconic Bond movie, not saying it's the best, but virgin viewers will more than likely already know Goldfinger and Bonds snarky exchange of words. You can find more complex villains in Bond films later in the series, Goldfinger is more 2D with a personality. Odd Job is adds a menacing presence to Goldfingers spoiled child attitude. The beginning is for sure the slowest part in terms of action and development, bit it picks up as more is snooped out about Goldfinger's plan.",Goldfinger
321,tobybunning,They Really Hit The Gold On This One,10,2 November 2020,"Goldfinger is pure gold from start to finish (pun intended here)Right off the bat you see action from a big explosion set up by Sean Connery's 007 to where after he has followed a dancer back to her room where he gets attacked by a man which concludes with Bond throwing him into a bath and electrocuting him and quoting ""shocking"" which in my own opinion I thought was a really good pun.Goldfinger also comes with 2 of the most famous Bond films antagonists in the shape of the gold obsessed Goldfinger (obviously) and the bowler hat throwing Oddjob. We also have the notorious Bond Girl Pussy Galore just to add to the character list as well I might point out.The plot to this film compared to its predecessors is far more simple to follow as well but don't get me wrong that is no bad thing, After scratching my head about the whole S.P.E.C.T.R.E plots over the past 2 films it has been a nice change. This is also the first film where we are also introduced to the iconic 007 Aston Martin and I have always wanted to know when we were presented with that car for the first time.Also the gadgets that 007 were given actually had of some use not just for the wow factor of the fact that he had the opportunity to use them and never did, he actually had use for them e.g. the gearstick passenger ejector seat or front facing machine guns.Overall Goldfinger is by far yes the most simplest in terms of plots compared to Sean Connery's Bond previous films, but that's a nice change compared to Dr No and From Russ With Love. We have 3 infamous supporting characters ( Goldfinger, Oddjob and Pussy Gallore ). Great action sequences throughout. A smooth talking Bond so hats off to the script writers ( no kills intended ). And we have the legendary Sean Connery as 007 so who can argue this is a solid Bond film.",Goldfinger
322,BrohmaBull007,Best Bond Film,9,17 February 2006,"This is it by far. I remember watching this film when I was 6 years old. This was the first Bond movie I've ever seen and this is what got me into Bond. You cant deny the fact that this movie was well constructed. Connery does his best work as Bond in this film as I would say his first 2 didn't have me going. This film I would say was Connery's breakout Bond film. Gert Frobe does a convincing job as Goldfinger. The battle of wit between Bond and Goldfinger as well as the battle between Oddjob and Bond were great. The romance and the action/adventure add a nice touch to what came out of the book. This is one of the shorter Bond films and I was a little shocked that it was under 2 hours. I would have liked it to be at least 25 more minutes. The plot was rock solid and kept me entertained throughout the film. I thought Pussy Galore alone would make this movie PG-13 but I guess this gets a strong PG. Q telling Connery ""Pay Attention Double 07"" is a classic line. There are other classic lines and moments that make this movie stand out from the rest. This is a classic Bond film that should be ranked near the tops of everyones ""Bond Charts."" Overall great Bond Film.",Goldfinger
323,trekfan2001,Great classic Bond,10,14 June 2003,"Goldfinger is probably the best known of all the Bond films. The scene with Shirley Eaton covered in gold paint is one of the all time classic moments in cinema.However, does Goldfinger live up to all they hype? It most certainly does! This is the Bond movie where all the classic elements come together. The cool gadgets, slightly off-beat villans, over the top story, silly names and plenty of women.*** spoiler alert ***Of course, the most well known gadget in all the Bond films is in ""Goldfinger"". Obviously, I'm referring to the Aston Martin DB5 with machine guns, ejection seat, smoke screen, tracking system and many other cool and deadly items. ;)The story for Goldfinger is also one of the more original Bond stories. Many Bond films fall back on the old formula of a meglomaniac who wants to destroy the world. In this one, the villan (Goldfinger) simply wants to destroy the gold reserve at Fort Knox to cripple the US economy and boost the value of his own gold.*** end spoilers ***Although ""From Russia With Love"" is my favourite Bond movie, I would still have to rate ""Goldfinger"" equally at 10/10",Goldfinger
324,A_Friend_of_Sarah_Connor,The reputation is almost better than the movie (SPOILERS),7,17 August 2004,"Out of the twenty-one official James Bond films, 1964's ""Goldfinger"" is the most well known, most loved and most parodied one. This has to do with numerous factors: a winning portrayal from Sean Connery, a memorable villain and Bond Girl in Auric Goldfinger and Pussy Galore, a ""golden girl"", the laser table scene, Odd Job with his razor brimmed bowler hat, the self-contained opener which is almost a movie by itself, etc. Anyone paying close attention would notice that all these things occur in the first half, and if the film had continued in this way throughout, I might agree with all the positive feedback it gets. But the fact is, at least for me, the second half of the film suffers from pacing problems that nearly sink the whole production.When compared to the previous two outings, ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia With Love"", ""Goldfinger"" is almost a disappointment. Surely anyone hoping the films would continue with their hard edge and low-key stories would be surprised to see that James Bond's third screen adventure pushes the boundaries on every aspect that was so well contained in the first two films to the point that every Bond film after was supposedly bigger than the last and there was competition to see how big you could get. This path eventually made a ""formula"" that every film was supposed to follow, and which the series became famous for. So love it or not, ""Goldfinger really put Bond on the map.So what's all the fuss about? Goldfinger (Gert Frobë) has put into action ""Operation Grand Slam"", a scheme that calls for detonating a dirty bomb in Fort Knox. This would make the gold radioactive and untouchable for 58 years, causing his own stock to raise many folds in value. The sheer simplicity of this plot makes the film extremely easy to follow, so all the audience has to do is sit back and watch the images unfold on screen.As I mentioned earlier, it's the memorable images that stick in the viewer's mind long after the movie's finished, even though the story is fairly tight and does the film more favours than a famous scene or two ever can. The question is: would ""Goldfinger"" be as popular without these scenes? And would a film like ""A View To A Kill"" be better with them? There's no doubt that these aspects, along with a memorable song from Shirley Bassey, a golden score from John Barry, and even a tricked-out Aston Martin DB5 are entertaining and are big reasons why the movie is so endlessly watchable. But ""Goldfinger"" isn't without it's flaws. After being captured by the villain, Bond walks around his stud farm as if he's invincible, doing nothing to try to warn the outside and chumming it up with everybody on site as if they're old college buddies. The paranoia present in the literary character and even in the James Bond of the preceding movies is sadly absent and gives birth to a character that is seemingly untouchable in future films.Not to mention Kentucky isn't exactly the most interesting locale for a bond film to be in, but these scenes are also pretty boring and Guy Hamilton's direction for them does nothing for me. This section also includes a scene where Goldfinger explains his entire plan to a bunch of stereotypically stupid American gangsters, just to kill them off minutes later. It can be argued that Goldfinger was trying to show off his ego and wealth, but that's flimsy at best and the entire ploy makes no sense otherwise.Then we get a distracting show when thousands of soldiers drop to the ground in an exaggerated way that's more laughable than serious, but the film does pick up when the bad guys break into Fort Knox and we get a pretty good finale, even though the fight with Odd Job looks a bit too staged. A few other complaints: the shots of planes ""flying"" are obviously fake, the car chase seems tacked-on and isn't particularly exciting (even though it's the first gadget-laden one), and the already mentioned ""formula"" makes things a bit too light, begging the question of how the series could've turned out if ""Goldfinger"" was never made.Not everything is as unfocused, though. Connery is obviously enjoying himself and even in the worst of scenes, pulls off another winner of a performance. Frobë makes one of the best villains in the Bond canon, and films in general. Even though he was dubbed, he's a commanding presence and never completely goes over-the-top. He's almost perfect casting, along with Harold Sakata as the deadly Odd Job, who while silent for the entire film, gives a threatening edge to the character. Honor Blackman is perfect in the role of Pussy and gives us a much tougher Bond Girl than in films past, while even the Q character gets a more strict and interesting personality.So while I can't argue that's there's fun to be had when watching ""Goldfinger"", the quality of the film is a step down from the superior two films before it, so even though I recommend it, I'd have to say that ""Thunderball"" would probably be a better bet. But so much has been written about this particular movie that no matter what I say can't stop it from being watched over and over again in the future. 7.5/10",Goldfinger
325,asdodge,"The First of the ""Formula"" Films, but still good",8,12 December 2008,"This is where it truly starts. Goldfinger really kicks off both ""Bondmania"" and the whole Bond Machine. while the next picture ""Thuderball,"" is the one that has the massed lines and craze, it was because of the groundwork set by the first three movies, of which ""Goldfinger"" put it all together.So, what is the ""Formulaic"" Bond??? 1. pre-titles sequence (already done in ""From Russia With Love""), but more developed here. 2. The titles themselves hit their stride (though Binder did not work on them in this film or the next, they were done in his style) and become the stereotypical Bond titles. 3. the megalomaniac with the plot to rule the world or create world-wide chaos (whether independently or as part of SPECTRE) 4. The Great Chase- some kind of intense chase involving lots of vehicles and crashes 5. The Bond gadgets- all kinds of cool tools and toys to help the secret agent become a super-agent. 6. The Bond Girls (good and Bad), including the overt use of the ""naughty names"" (""Sylvia Trench"" was subtle, but beginning with ""Pussy Galore,"" the boundaries were pushed. 7. Lots of explosions and the big fight scene (usually at the resolution of the primary plot). 8. Exotic locations (Kentucky may not be, but Switzerland and others certainly are). 9. Bond getting captured and the madman explaining his plans and Bond's subsequent miraculous escape from elaborate death sentences. 10. The exotic henchmen and thugs who beat up Bond then get killed later on. There are more, but these elements all come together for the first time in this movie.The plot revolves around Bond being asked to look into an Auric Goldfinger as some suspect he is illegally smuggling gold. As Bond investigates further and deeper he uncovers a much deeper plan involving a scheme to destroy America's gold reserve.Connery is obviously at ease as Bond in this third go-round, all all the MI6 supporting cast is present (M, Moneypenny, Q as played by Desmond Llewelyn). Outside of the slightly hair-brained plot of the bad guys (though, perhaps more potentially relevant today than then), the movie is scripted and acted well. The only weaknesses are more in the subtle messages leftover from Flemings novel. While some of these may be problems of the era and some may just be misinterpreted, the fact remains that Fleming had a definite attitude against woman, bordering on misogyny, and women are either just eye-candy cuties, not very bright, or bullish near dikes with little feminine qualities until James Bond defeats them (and ""converts"" them. In the novel of the same name, Pussy Galore and her squadron are Lesbians, and the movie tries to hint at it- look at the somewhat mannish demeanors of the sexy-suited flyers.This movie and the next two Connery outings (""Thunderball"" and ""You Only Live twice"") follow this formula to great success and entrench the formula firmly in the films. Lazenby's ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" followed this formula to a lesser degree, but it returns full force in ""Diamonds are Forever."" ""Goldfinger"" sets the mold for all Bond films, as does it well before the formula eventually tires and goes stale by the end of the Roger Moore run. The formula returns in the Brosnan series, but gets lost in chaotic plots and a need to constantly out-do the previous movie's amazing stunts and effects and breaks through the line of ""suspended disbelief"" to purely absurd ridiculousness. The Craig films do not truly follow the formula and profit by it.As the movies grow, the true detective/secret agent/spying business becomes lost in the high-paced action/adventure and the Bond film's move away from the earlier films. It doesn't mean all the movies are bad, but to me, the best are those that avoid the pure formula (""From Russia With Love,"" ""Live and Let Die,"" ""The Man With the Golden Gun,"" ""GoldenEye"" and ""Casino Royale.""Goldfinger is a great movie if you have not watched a lot of the older Bond films, but if you have caught many of the latter Connery then Moore films, it may seem a bit dated as it has the formula, but not the budgets and technology of the later films.",Goldfinger

327,theonewithallthecontacts,Bond becomes Bond in a masterpiece of a movie!,10,1 December 2012,"It's Goldfinger! The fourth Bond film overall, and the third of the EON series! Dr. No and From Russia With Love introduced us to Bond and reinvented cinema as we know it like never before! We had so many people to thank for these two movies. One of them was Terence Young. He directed Bond not only with dedication and professionalism, but with style and seriousness! Could any other Bond director give us the same virtues? Fortunately, the answer was yes. After Young departed from the Bond series, the search for a new director was cast. Guy Hamilton eventually got the gig, and were to direct ""Goldfinger"" which was the sixth novel of Ian Fleming's books! Hamilton had some good movies behind him, but could he take on the job as a Bond director? As said before, yes he could!Goldfinger grossed a lot of money with over 120 million dollars. Almost all critics gave it an overwhelming good response, and was looked as at the movie which changed the cinema forever! It was also the first Bond movie to win an Oscar (it won for best effects, sound effects). Goldfinger is one of the most beloved, probably THE most beloved of the entire series... and for a good reason! As many reviewers before me has said, this movie just has everything: an evil villain, a cool henchman, lots of humor, lots of action, beautiful women and some of the best gadgets Q has to offer! I really can't decide which Bond film is my favorite: From Russia With Love or Goldfinger. From Russia With Love is probably a better film overall, but Goldfinger is probably a better Bond film. Anyway, this movie is so fantastic, that you'll do yourself a favor if you choose to watch it! While Connery's first two Bond movies were very serious, one word continues to describe Goldfinger: entertainment! And I think that's more important in a Bond movie! Plus, this movie has my favorite climax of all the Bond films!This time Bond is sent out to investigate a possible gold smuggler named Auric Goldfinger. At first, Bond is just meant to investigate and follow him, but Bond is once again is lured into a plot that could change the world's economy for many years! Doesn't exactly benefits Bond that Goldfinger has an indestructible henchman called Oddjob, who can kill a person with his bowler hat! There's no SPECTRE or SMERSH, just a bastard named Goldfinger who loves gold and hates losing. I think it fits the story, to be a stand alone film. The story is like the previous Bond films, so well told so the movie never drags. There are tons of action and beautiful women, and Bond utters arguably the best Bond line ever which is ""Shocking... positively shocking."" It's so different than the others, but in a way it's also more entertaining. It's the best BOND movie ever made!Sean Connery marks his third appearance as James Bond, and he is enjoying himself here! Connery is still as charming and smooth as before, and he slightly more Bond in Goldfinger, as we've come to known him! Gert Fröbe is Auric Goldfinger, as the villain of the piece. He's fantastic! He's not physically imposing, but he's such an interesting character, as his villainous nature later reveals. He has my favorite scheme for a Bond villain ever, and he is given many good lines (you know which i'm talking about). Goldfinger is arguably the best Bond villain in the entire series! Honor Blackman is Pussy Galore, and she is also very good. Her character is hinted at being lesbian (as she is in the novel) which is something we don't usually see from a Bond girl. She'd be my nr. 4 on my top 10 Bond girls. Harold ""Tosh Togo"" Sakata is just plain awesome as Oddjob! He doesn't talk but he doesn't need to. Just looking at him you'll know that he is a baddie! That thing with his throwing hat, has just been parodied so much over the years! Shaw is still my favorite Bond henchman, but Oddjob is still a close nr. 2! We also have the second Felix Leiter actor, Cec Linder. I like his performance, but as the first actor since Jack Lord to portray the character, he is kind of a let down! Lord's performance as Leiter was the definitive one! Desmond Llewelyn marks his second appearance as Q, and his briefing has never been better than it is in Goldfinger! Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell is brought back as M and Moneypenny, and you know they're good. All in all, this is a Bond movie that a Bond fan is not allowed to miss! It's just unacceptable if that could happen! Goldfinger sat the standards for all coming Bond villains to come, and changed the cinema forever. However, this also marked the point where Bond movies would try to top each other every single time. I'm not saying Goldfinger is a part of the ordeal, as it was the movie who started it all, but you can't get around the fact that the movie is a bit silly. Oddjob's hat, all the lasers, the car gadgets, etc. But I know it's a Bond movie, and without Goldfinger, we probably wouldn't know Bond as we know him today! Goldfinger is the perfect amount of silly, and the plot is still very well done! And it's all damn good entertainment! I'm gonna go ahead and call it my pic for the best Bond film ever made! This movie is Goldfinger... and it's absolutely friggin' awesome!10/10",Goldfinger
328,big_bellied_geezer,The Standard by which later Bond films will be judged....,10,24 October 2001,"A great piece of escapism that has held up well thru the years as a tightly paced film and a standard by which other Bond films are often judged by. There are so many great scenes in this film that tickle me every time, when Bond outsmarts Goldfinger on the golf course, the Pussy Galore flying circus scenes, the scenes where the Mob bosses are eventually snuffed out, the Lincoln crushing scene because it's so outrageous to have crushed a new car, and the scene where Goldfinger gets pulled thru the plane's broken window to his demise, and many others. The classic theme as sung by the still great Shirley Bassey is a ""10""!!(I saw her perform recently in Atlantic City NJ and she is awesome!..only odd thing is she did every Bond theme she recorded except ""Goldfinger""..not sure why.) I have always enjoyed this film upon repeat viewings thru the years and always looked forward to it's occasional showing on Sunday night on ABC network in the years before video players were a common household item. I have always wondered about one scene in the movie if it's a mistake or not....when Bond and Goldfinger are fighting in the Plane for the gun and the gun goes off, there is a long shot of Bond grabbing hold of one of the plane's seats as Goldfinger is flying toward the broken window..but I swear there is a person lying in the isle on the floor near Bond!?? If this is so, who is it supposed to be? A person who got knocked out when debris started flying? Is it the Asian hostess that spied on Bond when he was on board the last time?

This film sits on a place of high rank in the Bond canon, being highly visual in its first act, with some delicious scenes and villains as it goes along. The gadgets, the girls, the lines, all cultivated in this film, which would go on to serve as a template for the entire series. Humorous, over-the-top, and as silly as it is, the fun factor is undeniable in this one.

That being said the inane plot is handled nicely, with Connery giving one of his best Bonds, Odd Job laminating over the franchise as one of the most memorable villains, as well as Honor Blackman as a tempting Pussy Galore.

What he doesn't know: Goldfinger wants to contaminate all the gold stock in Fort Knox radio to drive up his fortune. Sean Connery is now stepping into the role of British agent 007 for the third time. And he makes it perfect! Connery has found himself in this role and is Bravura! As a villain, German actor Gert Fröbe has now been hired. Frob gives the megalopic gold finger a real face. A real opponent of the old James Bond classics and one of the best. Also here, a right hand of the villain is introduced here: Odd Job. Harold Sakata, a Hawaiian wrestler, plays the first proper bodyguard with technical finesse here.
Although it seems simple to watch a hat as a killing method, it is fun. Honor Blackman plays Pussy Galore. Although she doesn't end up as a bondgirl until later, she was more interested in women than men. Which is also an innovation, middle in the 60s. The combination in the 1964 agent series is fun associated with classic action. That's why Goldfinger is considered one of the best in the series. It promises everything that makes an agent movie: Humor, a classic battle between good and evil, an overmotivated villain with a strong aide and with very many beautiful women!

Honor's brand of feminism was as off-putting in the film as it was off-set. Yet...her hourglass figure and erotic allure almost, and I repeat, almost, made up for that. I wonder how much grief she surely must hav given the teasing cast for addressing her by her 'Bond Girl' noniker, because you had to figure that they probably did, as self-important as she thought herself to be, given that she no doubt loathed the vulgarity of the word.

333,mcfische,"The first great 007 film, but the weakest of the greats",6,4 August 2003,"1964'S ""Goldfinger,"" the third Bond film of the series, was the first truly great Bond film. Many Bond traditions are established in this film, the villain and his henchmen are excellent, and the action is extraordinary. However, as this is the first Bond film to really stand out, it has bugs that would be worked out in later great Bond films. Of what I consider the great Bond films, this is the weakest.First of all, the plot is new and fresh. This is the first film to have the villain not be a member of SPECTRE. Goldfinger's plan would actually damage SPECTRE and the international economy; exploding a nuclear device in Fort Knox. The villain also is obsessed with gold, like Blofeld is with his cat. Goldfinger truly is a great Bond villain. Most movies make the villain seem invincible until the end. Here, Bond succeeds against Goldfinger until the second hour of the film starts. Strapped to a golden table, a laser moving towards his groin, Bond says ""Do you expect me to talk?"" Goldfinger's response; ""No, Mr. Bond. I expect you to die!"" Oddjob, the lethal manservant, is exactly the opposite of the other famous mute servant, Bernado of the Zorro legend.I liked many things about this film. After two films having the part of Q but never calling him that, Desmond Llewelyn in the part of Major Boothroyd finally becomes the Quartermaster of MI6. After the single gadget of ""From Russia With Love"" Bond now gets his usual assortment of gadgets; one or two minor ones and a high-tech car. In this case, he gets two tracking devices and his famous Aston Martin DB5, with the line ""I never joke about my work 007."" We finally get a woman equal to Bond, Pussy Galore. And it's about time. She resists his advances for an entire hour of the movie, she knows judo, is a professional pilot, and is a little cat-like. Tilly Masterson would've been a Bond equal, but she's such a lousy shot that she's hopeless. She's also the only Bond woman that Bond never even kissed as far as I know. Her sister was just a part with no importance. The action in this film is excellent, as is the acting. Sean seems like he took it up a notch here.Dislikes; along with the one woman who does nothing, Bond doesn't completely wreck his car. It's in the next movie. There isn't as much action as would be preferred, but the action they have is good, long, and well-done. Felix Lieter looks too old in this one.All in all, a great and enjoyable film.",Goldfinger

336,dansandini,Bond at His Best,7,5 June 2015,"Of course this is dated, but digitally remastered it really is worth the price of admission. Sean Connery plays James Bond and has some pretty good one liners. As a matter of fact it's the gafaws that keep the entertainment coming. How did they get Bond to say ""Pussy"" so many times without breaking a smile. Note also the impeccable costuming here. Bond's creases are razor sharp, even while in a violent struggle with Pussy et. al. Points also for some striking scenery in the Swiss Alps. Points also for Q providing Bond with a pretty good approximation of what decades later was to become ""Google Maps."" Grab a Martini and re-enjoy this timeless classic. (shaken not stirred, of course.)",Goldfinger
337,lotus49,The Best Bond (which is usually your First Bond),10,20 February 1999,"The first and still the best Bond I have seen. It catches 007 before the genre became purely formulaic. I'm sure contemporary audiences will quickly note the politically incorrect temperament of the film, which makes it all the more enjoyable. Connery as Bond was never better. Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) fills the villains role with typical malicious calculation and sang froide. Oddjob as enforcer is a throw back to the inscrutable Asian bad men of the Republic serials. Shirley Bassey's theme song and the wonderful Bond Aston Martin DB5.. M, Q, Moneypenny and the inimitable Pussy Galore.. the whole thing is a treat.",Goldfinger
338,F0RCE,Everything a Bond film should be!,9,27 March 2001,"""Goldfinger"" is without a doubt my favorite of all the Bond films.It contains a great story and a remarkable cast to act it out.  This film constantly changes its location.  Different locations such as sunny Florida, the Swiss Alps, and even Fort Knox help the film to hold the audiences attention.  This film does not have any dull spots.  The story is constantly unfolding and if you take a trip to the bathroom you will miss something good.The extremely talented and charming Sean Connery reprises his role as Britain's top secret agent.  Connery is easily the best Bond to date.  His presence contributes the portrayal of 007.This film also involves two of the hottest Bond girls in Shirley Eaton and Honor Blackman.  The Bond girls are a trademark of the Bond films and these are two of the best.  They both bring a touch of danger to the screen despite ultimately falling for our hero.Two of the most deadly villians in the history of Bond also appear in this film.  Gert Frobe portrays the evil Auric Goldfinger who will stop at nothing to destroy Bond and take over the world's gold supply.  His sidekick Odd Job, is easily one of the most memorable villians.  He possesses raw strength (he can crush a golf ball in the palm of his hand) as well as a deadly weapon-his hat (which he could easily use to decapitate a human being).In addition to the characters, the story is one of the most exciting ever. Nuclear destruction is the ultimate villian that Bond must defeat.  This is one of the best Bond's ever.  It contains a great deal of action, the always-present sexual inuendos, romance, humor and a great cast.

And for the record, Shirley Eaton is hot as Jill Masterson, while Pussy is sassy! Not to forget, any Bond movie with an Ason Martin DB5 featuring oil slips and weapons would totally kicked Chuck Norris's butt! And the Fort Knox scene including the fight between Oddjob and Bond is super! A recommended movie for all movie buffs and Bond fans.So, is this a good Bond movie? Hell yeah!

From the explosive and exciting (but utterly pointless) teaser sequence, through the epochal theme song; the gold-painted Jill Masterson and the outrageous Pussy Galore; the excellent Goldfinger and his iconic sidekick Oddjob, to the climax of the film in Fort Knox I was glued to the screen.  All these elements were to be repeated in some form or another in later Bond films, usually to diminishing effect.  'Goldfinger' was the first, and the best.

342,wolf-53,classic movie,8,30 March 1999,"Although not quite as good as From Russia With Love, Goldfinger is still a great Bond movie.  It became the guideline for which all following Bond movies are compared to.  Although it is completely unbelievable, you have to take the movie for what it is worth, and that is that it is an action movie.
Sean Connery is once again fantastic as Bond, and Gert Frobe and Harold Sakata are great bad guys.  Although her performance is a little dry, Honor Blackman is still a memorable Bond girl if only for her name, Pussy Galore.A great movie.  9/10",Goldfinger

I am a huge fan of 007 movies.  I have seen all 19 of them and am looking forward to Bond 20, and Goldfinger is for sure in my top 3.  I rated it a 9/10",Goldfinger
344,Orpington,The Blueprint For the Franchise,8,21 July 2003,"Goldfinger was the third Bond film and, on its release in 1964, proved itself to be the first blockbuster of the series, firmly establishing OO7 in the public imagination. Dr No and From Russia with Love had both been successful, but Goldfinger outperformed both at the Box Office, and in the process laid down the guidelines for nearly every Bond film that has followed since.There is undoubtedly much to admire about the film, not least the memorable Shirley Bassey theme song, still one of the best. Guy Hamilton directs with impressive assurance, the locations are excellent and  Sean Connery is once again the epitome of cool as Bond, although he is not as menacing as he was in the first two films. He is, however, still a believable character and finds himself in genuine danger during the film, having to rely on his wits to survive.  Goldfinger is one of the great Bond villains, played with real bonhomie by Gert Frobe, who succeeds in making him a more fleshed-out character than many of the one-dimensional baddies of later films. The wonderfully-named Pussy Galore, meanwhile, is one of the best Bond girls. Honor Blackman plays her as a woman with real spirit and intelligence, and it is a pity she does not get more screen time.Goldfinger also introduced several elements which have since become cliches of the Bond series. For the first time Bond visits Q's workshop to pick up his equipment, and for the first time he receives some fancy gadgets, packaged up in the famous and stylish Aston Martin. The film is also injected with a lot more humour than its predecessors, with OO7 throwing out one-liners more frequently and a somewhat camper tone being introduced to proceedings. As Oddjob, Howard Sakata is the first in a long line of totally silent but lethal henchmen. He is not as good as Red Grant in From Russia with Love (who spoke), but his deadly hat is memorable, and he is a formidable opponent for Bond.Good as it is, however, it could be argued that Goldfinger had a malign influence on many of its successors. Because it was so successful, the Bond producers became convinced that later OO7 releases should follow the same gadget-led, tongue-in-cheek style, but on a grander scale. As a result, Goldfinger began the shift away from the relatively serious, hard-edged tone of the first two films towards the light-hearted visual spectaculars that would come to dominate the franchise in the 1970s. Taken on its own terms, though, Goldfinger certainly ranks as one of the best Bond films, and is much better than the later ones which tried hardest to mimic and outdo it. Personally I like the tougher films in the franchise the best, especially From Russia with Love, but Goldfinger is the most enjoyable Bond film of its kind, and deserves its classic status.",Goldfinger
345,gwilym49,Probably the best of the bond films.,9,18 March 2001,"For plot structure, characterisation, tension, and defamiliarisation, this is probably the best of the Bond genre. From the opening Miami beach scene with its horrific death by paint murder we move through various European countries with a natty fully gadgeted sports car (equipped with ejector seat!) back full circle to the United States with its nail-biting climax. On the way we are treated to the usual car chase scenes (with use of the ejector seat!) and a personally threatening scene with a laser beam. As well as  Bond, the British Secret service, and Goldfinger himself, the US armed forces and the Mafia become involved!An action- packed treat well worth seeing again.",Goldfinger

347,The_Eighth_Passenger,Where Bond started to get silly.,7,14 January 2010,"Another year, another Bond film. They sure did churn them out back in the sixties...Considered by many to be the quintessential Bond movie, Goldfinger sees much of the groundwork set for what will become standard and eventually cliché in later pictures. Bond is tasked to observe billionaire gold lover and crime boss Auric Goldfinger (Gert Fröbe) to confirm suspicions MI6 and the CIA have that he is planning 'something big'. On his way he fights, shags and escapes in the ways you'd expect and of course he even finds time to sit down and have a drink with the enemy.After the great From Russia With Love, Goldfinger has a lot to live up to. As far as I'm concerned it's a definite drop in quality but that isn't to say it is without merit. Connery has started winking at the audience instead of concentrating on his performance and the part doesn't feel as well written as the last two films. Guy Hamilton takes over as director and he does an admirable job. The sweeping helicopter shot over Miami beach to the hotel where we meet Bond after the pre-title sequence is impressive in its' ambition and grandeur and is a perfect example of how Goldfinger is trying to be a 'bigger' film than its predecessors. It is also worth noting that this is the first Bond film and Sean Connery's only not to involve S.P.E.C.T.R.E. and/or Ernst Stavro Blofeld. I think this plays a huge factor in its popularity with the general public as it feels very much like its own contained story, whereas other early Bond films, individual stories they may be, always make reference to each other and have a feeling of Bond getting higher up the chain of command towards Blofeld.Goldfinger's plan too is much grander than we have previously seen, with an elaborate plan to break into Fort Knox involving far too many variables. This is also the first Bond film where the villain inexplicably keeps 007 alive for seemingly no other reason than to explain to the audience through boasting dialogue what is going on and to eventually let Bond foil his plan. It is handled reasonably well here but it is ultimately rather poor writing. Auric Goldfinger himself does not suffer from bad writing, his dialogue is generally of a high quality and often brilliant. He and Bond share possibly the most famous hero/villain exchange from the franchise; ""Do you expect me to talk?"" ""No, Mr Bond, I expect you to die!"" Honour Blackman as Pussy Galore is the first non-attractive Bond girl and her voice and line delivery annoy me beyond belief. Her casting will forever remain a mystery to me. Felix Leiter makes his second appearance in the series, this time played by Cec Linder. Unfortunately his character goes from being a worthy ally to Bond to being a kind of 'gee-shucks' sidekick without much useful to do. Goldfinger's man servant Odd Job serves as the main henchman of the film and again is a perfect example of the silly factor being upped as his primary means of attack is throwing a bowler hat (!)With all this said it may seem like I dislike Goldfinger but that is not the case at all, it is a great Bond adventure with much to recommend it. It is thoroughly entertaining, very well paced and even though it is responsible for much of 'the formula' it manages to not be too groan-inducing. It also has one of the best pieces of music from the series as the Fort Knox break in is taking place. It has no sense of mystery or intrigue though and is definitely geared more towards being an action film than a thriller. To quote John Cork in 'James Bond: The Legacy', ""This is no longer the detective thriller/Saturday afternoon serial world of Dr No, or the darkly mysterious one of From Russia With Love. It is a world of heightened absurdity, where a man can crush a golf ball with his bare hand, and a lesbian changes her sexual preference after a (literal) roll in the hay with 007.""I recommend Goldfinger highly to casual Bond fans as it contains a great main villain and some good action, it is probably the most well-known and 'classic' of the series and I can see why so many consider it the ultimate Bond film. I love all the films in the series (except Diamonds Are Forever) and Goldfinger is no exception but I feel it's place as the 'ultimate' is somewhat unfair to the half a dozen or so other films which far surpass it in quality and intrigue.",Goldfinger
348,davew-5,Why do people think this is good?,3,18 August 2000,"OK, it has some good aspects:  the laser scene, the campy villain, Oddjob.  But I have three big objections to this movie:1. Bond doesn't DO anything.  Hardly ever does he manage to overcome his adversaries either by strength or by quick-thinking.2. The golf-course scene is booooooring.  I can't think of any other sequence in the whole Bond series which is so dull.3. All Bond movies need good, exotic locations.  Most of this movie takes place in Kentucky.All in all, this is probably my least favorite of all the Bonds. Even the worst of the Roger Moore movies had more going on.",Goldfinger

351,a2d_music,the best Bond? No. But still damn good!,7,23 November 1999,"No one can question this movie's impact on the series or the genre.  It blew the doors open, in fact, for a previously somewhat taboo genre of film that was looked at in the same light as ""True Crime"" and other pulp 'zines.But for all that, it is still not the perfection of the Bond series.  The difficulty is balancing the series on an equalized playing field.  'Dr. No' cannot be compared, on a simple level, with 'For Your Eyes Only,' for example.  The series evolved, the character (in the films, at least) evolved, etc.  As such, it is hard to call any Bond film the BEST.With all that in mind, we are simply left with personal preferences.  Connery is at his peak as Bond, and the villain Goldfinger is the beginning of the true Bondian ""supervillain"".Because it is the first such extension, it can't help but be lacking - the form was not yet perfected.

356,gala0008,Simply the Best,10,13 March 2006,"Sean Connery is beyond a shadow of a doubt the finest James Bond of the series and Goldfinger is (in my opinion and many others) the best Bond movie ever done. This being the third film of the series, Connery is more comfortable in the role as Bond and delivers his best performance yet.I especially like Goldfinger because Bond spends almost half the film in captivity yet he still keeps it interesting. Unlike Moore who often relied on heavy shooting scenes (I realize there was a battle in this one but it wasn't that one scene that made the movie) and Pierce Brosnan who needs an explosion ever 5 minutes to keep the audience's attention, Connery uses his superior acting talents to produce better results.The theme music was also among the best and I particularly enjoy all of Goldfinger's scenes due to the ironic humor and spoiled, yet evil, nature. But one of my favorite things about this movie is the villain Odd Job. He is by far one of my favorite bond villains (tied with Jaws) because of his quiet and deadly manner that still makes you laugh. And for those of you who haven't figured it out, he's the inspiration for the Austin Powers villain Random Task.All in all if you haven't seen this movie and you're a fan of James Bond series you absolutely must see the film.",Goldfinger

There's a lengthy sequence where the character Felix Leiter (Cec Linder) trails a vehicle, accompanied by magnificent orchestration, to its destination. To have Bond offscreen for so long would be unthinkable in later movies. Also, Gert Fröbe's performance as Goldfinger is masterly, and brings to mind a number of self-obsessed businessman I have met with in real life.Trying to identify why the movie is so enjoyable is not so easy. On many levels it is ridiculous, with a loophole-ridden plot dependent on multiple coincidences, unbelievable characters, a non-extant backstory, bad science and a casual disregard for avoiding racial or sexual stereotypes. Watch it in the right spirit, however, and it is an excellent Saturday afternoon thriller, with plenty of action, a music score to die for and its leading foot clearly in fantasy.

Scene silliness : At his ranch, Goldfinger holds a meeting with (over-acting) gang bosses who want paying for equipment that they have supplied him, and explains his whole plot them. He then gasses them all (but one). Why waste the time explaining the plot, when he must be a very busy man on the eve of his big day?

The one surviving gang boss is chauffeured away by Odd Job with his gold ingot payment in the boot. Down the road, Odd Job shoots him. But instead of driving back to the ranch, Odd Job drives on to a breakers yard where the car is crushed into a cube, which Odd Job then drives back to the ranch in a pick-up truck. Here Goldfinger makes the comment that gold now needs to be extricated from the cube. What was the point of crushing the car? The body was still in it anyway.

The teaser involves James Bond in Cuba and has him blow up an installation.  Immediately after that he is in a bar and then a room kissing a dancing girl from the bar.  A thug comes up from behind and attempts to club him but he sees him in the girl's eyes and spins her around (she is setting him up) so she gets knocked out.  A brawl ensues followed by the thug taking a dunk in the bathtub.  As the thug reaches for 007's gun, hanging in its holster nearby, Bond throws a fan into the tub and electrocutes him.  He says, ""Shocking."" and leaves. The plot of the movie starts in Miami Beach at a large, beachfront hotel full of beautiful women.  Bond spies on Auric Goldfinger, a suspicious man who always cheats to win, if needed.  Bond breaks into Goldfinger's hotel window where a beautiful blonde, Jill Masterson, is supplying by radio link and binoculars Goldfinger's opponent's hand of cards in a game of gin at the poolside below.  Bond interrupts and makes Goldfinger lose $10,000 to his opponent under the threat of reporting him to the authorities.      Bond and the girl make love and the next day he finds her dead, covered with gold paint, from ""skin suffocation"".  When I was a kid and saw this on T.V. I thought this was very cool and artistic.  He meets with M and Q makes his first appearance in this movie.  He is given an Astin Martin for use. It is equipped with a passenger ejector seat, smoke screen, bullet proof armor, a bullet proof rear window shield, machine guns, and rear oil slick capability along with a radar screen for homing device tracking.  He is also given two homing devices and a Nazi gold bar collectors' item to tempt Goldfinger with.      He goes to Goldfinger's golf club in England and plays golf with him, betting the gold bar.  He catches Goldfinger cheating and wins 5000 pounds. Goldfinger reminds him that this is the second time he has foiled him and has his henchman, Odd Job, a Korean heavyweight, throw his bowler hat to chop the head off a statue to warn him.  He writes Bond a check and leaves in his Rolls Royce which Bond follows, he has planted a homing device on it, to the airport.  The car is loaded on a plane and Bond follows him to the Geneva area of Switzerland.  Tilly Masterson, the dead girl's sister, appears to snipe at Bond with a rifle while he is watching Goldfinger. Later, Bond spies on Goldfinger's headquarters which are called something like Auric Industries.  There he learns that gold is smuggled by the villain in his Rolls Royce and the name of a plan called Operation Grand Slam. Later, he runs into Tilly who really was shooting at Goldfinger but is a bad shot.  They are chased on foot after they trip a security wire and a car chase follows in which he wrecks two cars with his vehicle armaments. They are caught and the girl is killed by Odd Job's bowler and Bond is brought to face the villain.  He is tied, spread eagled, to a bold plate and a laser is allowed to progress towards his crotch and to cut his body in half as he is taunted by Goldfinger who says this is the third and last time Bond will try to foil him.  The dialog and tension is great.  He gets out of death by mentioning Operation Grand Slam and worrying Goldfinger about what knowledge he may have about this plan.  He is tranquilized and wakes up in Goldfinger's private jet flying over the Atlantic and meets his personal pilot and chief pilot trainer, Pussy Galore (one of the more suggestive female lead names).      They land at Goldfinger's horse breeding stables in Kentucky.  Bond is locked in a cell.  Goldfinger has a meeting with head mafia people from throughout the US.  They had helped him smuggle materials and a nuclear bomb into the country.  He reveals his plan to set off the bomb in Fort Knox to contaminate a large part of the world's gold and drive up the value of the gold he is hoarding.  However, after his speech he kills them with powerful nerve gas because he owes them money, apparently. Bond lures the guard into his cell and escapes.  He also learns the details of Operation Grand Slam and is caught by Pussy.  He romances her, they have sex in a stable, and he convinces her to replace the deadly nerve gas in her fleet of female piloted planes with harmless gas.  They fly over Fort Knox and spray it and the soldiers play dead.  Goldfinger breaks into Fort Knox with dynamite and his laser which is in a phony army ambulance. The bomb timer is set but the army attacks and a battle ensues.  Bond has got to stop the timer on the bomb.  He fights Odd Job who is kicking his butt.  He electrocutes Odd Job while he is reaching for his bowler which is embedded in steel bars, Bond had thrown it and missed, with a loose electric cable.  He cannot figure out the bomb but an American expert stops it with 007 seconds remaining.  Bond gets on an American jet for the White House to meet the President.  However, Goldfinger is on the plane, the crew had been knocked out.  Bond gets into a fight with him but Goldfinger shoots a hole in a window with his golden gun and is sucked out to his death.  His golden gun had me confused for a while, when I was a kid, with the other Bond movie, The Man with the Golden Gun.  Pussy and Bond cannot recover the plane's altitude and they bail before it crashes.  Bond and Pussy make out after he stops her from signaling a rescue helicopter. The plot was exciting with many twists and turns and I give it a 10 of 10.  The villain was played by a famous German actor and I would give him a perfect score except that his accent, when filming, was so heavy they had to dub over his voice and the dub job was not the greatest so I give him a 9 of 10.  Special effects for the time were great but now they are kind of simple so I give them an 8 of 10.  The Goldfinger song is my second favorite after the instrumental theme from On Her Majesty's Secret Service and I give it a 10 of 10.  The locales, including America, were great and I give them a 9 of 10.  They could have shown the beautiful Alps of Switzerland just a little bit more.  Goldfinger's empire was terrific and Sean Connery was at his best in this Bond movie.  The female lead was Honor Blackmon who was lured from her British t.v. show, the Avengers, to be in this movie.  Diana Rigg replaced her on the t.v. show and later she was in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, a later Bond movie, where she actually married James Bond. Overall, I give the movie a 9 out of 10 because it is a little dated and slow paced in parts but also very very exciting with one of the best plots of the Bond movies.  I really like this one.",Goldfinger
369,JMitnik,One of the best...,9,28 March 2010,"This is one of the best Bond Movies. It has everything...The Music as usual is great. The theme song in this movie is Goldfinger, and deserves to be on the top 3 of best Bond themes.The story is better than ever. James Bond getting tortured, his ""love"" getting brutally killed, he being captured and almost killed himself. Not to forget the characters. I adored characters such as Oddjob, Pussy Galore, and the grandma with the gun. I mean, what do you want more...? The action is also extremely good. With that, I especially mean the end sequence where everybody fights each other. Very cool. And the coolest of all... is the showdown between Bond and Oddjob. That was just epic! Furthermore, this one is great and entertaining. Don't miss out on this one!",Goldfinger
370,clockworkorange13,Did I watch the same movie?,5,1 September 2019,"All I can say after watching Goldfinger was ""wow"", and I mean that in a bad way. It was like watching a student film version of a James Bond movie. Its technically sloppy all around, and it seems like the director had no clue what he was doing, especially in the 2nd half. I mean seriously, Bond is a prisoner through much of the movie but yet he is basically allowed to roam free around Goldfinger's compound like he's a visiting relative. This movie was practically incoherent, like it was randomly thrown together in the spur of the moment.",Goldfinger
371,ThomasHayden,Everything he touches turns to excitement !,10,20 September 2005,"This is the Bond movie which originally established what Bond fans call ""the formula"": that is, a fast-paced,exhilarating( though slightly unbelievable) action story, completed with lots of beautiful women , sexual innuendo and witty one-liners. Though From Russia With Love was a realistic and suspenseful thriller, the producers took a new direction with Goldfinger. From this movie on, Bond films were set in a kind of fictionalized "" real world"" where the most incredible gadgets and far-fetched , action-packed story lines seemed completely normal for the characters involved. Realism was gone, but it is trough all these elements that the Bond series achieved the enormous popular success which has made it the most enduring series in cinema history.Goldfinger features all of the elements described above, but what makes it an unforgettable and distinctive entry is the way they are put together. There are the usual lovelies, but they are in the story for a reason. There is a power-driven, psychotic villain, but he is charismatic as well. Of course, he has a mute and ( almost) invincible henchman, who enjoys killing people in a particularly bizarre ( though lethal) way. And the villain's devilish scheme is, to the very least, brilliant( even Bond has to concede it).An especial mention should go to Maibaum and Dehn's screenplay, which proves that there was talent involved in the writing department of EON productions. Though the storyline is , in fact, rather thin,( Bond initially follows a trail, then he leaves it, only to find out what the villain is up to thanks to hearing these words "" Operation Grand Slam"") the individual sequences and set pieces are so cool that they easily conceal some plot holes.And a dry sense of humor permeates the film. The golf match scene is superb,but the film's highlight is the final confrontation between Bond and Goldfinger's deathly servant, Oddjob. But there is plenty of memorable images here, too. The girl painted in gold, and the figure of the hit-man reflected on Bond'd lover eye in the teaser are worth noting.It goes without a saying that the cast is terrific this time. Even the main girl has personality and thinks by herself, instead of instantly falling into the clutches of 007.This is just a general review. Goldfinger has much more to offer. Buy the DVD and enjoy.",Goldfinger
372,tiagogilbatista,Guy Hamilton lacks Terrence Young's vision,5,27 January 2007,"Having discovered the Bond films later than most people and having an admiration of Sean Connery I must be critical of the third movie, Golffinger. Unlike the first two movies directed by Terrence Young,this Guy Hamilton's film lacks the glamor and art work of the previous films. It focus mainly on Bonds fixation with women(who are used and abused in most scenes) and has a few clichés about Bond's taste for class, which prove ridiculous because the Bond doesn't have to demonstrate explicitly his class, making the director's effort pointless. The story is interesting but it takes away Bond's charisma making him as a simple pawn who is lucky. Resumedly: Guy Hamilton can a make an entertaining film but lacks the vision and dept of Terrence Young",Goldfinger
373,bozotang,The best James Bond,9,15 December 1999,"Looked at this gem again last week. No doubt in my mind this is the best James Bond movie of the lot.

374,tmm_8705,The Most Iconic of the Bond Films.,10,7 August 2015,"If you only heard of James Bond through the prism of pop culture, you likely heard of the many things that are associated with this installment. Bond strapped to a table with a laser moving up his groin. Oddjob, the henchmen who wears a steal rimmed bowler hat that can decapitate a statue's head. The leading lady named Pussy Galore. Bond's Aston Martin DB5 sported with gadgets. The villain Goldfinger, who plots to break into the U.S. Gold Bullion Depository in Fort Knox. Everything that ultimately made the series what it is, it's all here.It carries a lot of what the first two films introduced, now mostly refined. This time the pre-title sequence is entirely separate from the main story, as if it were a short film giving audiences an idea of what's in store. The main title sequence now features the song of the film, this time sung by Shirley Bassey. The dynamic between Bond and Q is now defined with banter, as Bond is presented his gadget laden car. These kind of refinements are what would establish the Bond formula that would from this point be used in Bond films in various ways, for better or worse.This installment is based off of the seventh novel written by Ian Fleming. As an adaptation, it stays relatively true to the source material. However, vital alterations were made for the film and I can say that they were largely an improvement. In the original novel, Auric Goldfinger actually plots to rob all the gold bullion from Fort Knox, which would have been very improbable, even for a Bond adventure. The film finds a more clever solution, which I'll leave unspoiled. Other changes worked in the same nature or were simple novel to film translations in telling the story.Guy Hamilton directs this installment. Where the previous director Terence Young treated the first two films more as spy thrillers, Hamilton aims for a more comic book flavor with a breezier tone and emphasis on humor, whether through visual gags or interaction between characters. This is another factor that would play a big role into how future Bond films would proceed, some succeeding while others going too far.Sean Connery is as comfortable as ever in the role of Bond. He plays Bond much more smarmy for a lot of the film, but that's mainly to get under the skin of the villain's boisterous nature. Gert Fröbe is truly fantastic as the villain Auric Goldfinger. What's remarkable is that he was dubbed by a voice actor, because he didn't speak very much English. On set he would actually speak German, but mouth the words close to English as much as possible. Despite being dubbed, he still carries a lot of the performance through his body language and the voice actor Michael Collins does a great job of matching that performance. His character is aided by the henchmen Oddjob, who's possibly the most iconic of all the henchmen that Bond had to face. A simple gag has him crush a golf ball with his bare hand, setting him up as a tough opponent for Bond to fight later in the film. Honor Blackman plays the Bond lady Pussy Galore, who's known not only for the silly and suggestive name but for also for initially not being easily swayed by Bond's charms, telling him ""you can turn off the charm, I'm immune.""GOLDIFNGER is often cited among the best of the Bond films, if not the best. While it's certainly iconic, it also known for weaknesses like Bond being mostly held captive for the second half of the film. The argument being that he comes off as someone that doesn't effect the plot so much. That may be true, but then again that same argument is being made about how Indiana Jones wouldn't have changed the outcome of the plot in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. It's an oddity in stories about heroes, but I suppose what ultimately matters is if the film's adventure is fun and engaging. This one definitely is.",Goldfinger
375,simon-thome2,The Goldfinger Phenomenon,8,26 October 2004,"This third James Bond movie is definitely a classic, a general classic. Directed in 1964 by Guy Hamilton and produced by Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Brocolli ""Goldfinger"" became the first 007 flick providing the ultimate potential of a box-office hit. It smashed all records in reference to sales figures, marketing, popularity and cult status at this time. There are innumerable marketing articles which not only retained their value but increased it multiplicatively. For instance this time ago, in 1964/65, the 007 patent-leather shoes were sold in particular stores, nowadays the shoebox only is 400$ worth. In addition to the movie itself another legend was established, the Aston Martin DB5, then the first legendary Bond car. A miniature factory in Great Britain manufactured a limited edition of this legendary car coated with 14 carat gold plating. This demonstrates the incredible Bond hype in England, in US and all over Europe cause none of those marketing strategies were known in this form before. During the planing days of the movie the Aston Martin DB5 was in fact a not sold prototype which later converted to be one of the most elegant and idolized cars in the world. To outline this movie only as a huge box-office hit would be too improper. The plot is not overpowering but nonetheless gripping. The secret agent with his tailor-made suit and this sweet little inferiority complex chases a gold-addicted villain who eliminates two hot blondes just because Bond apparently tarnishes his golden ego by winding Goldfinger up at an unfair played golf match and ending his winning streak at gambling. Further it might be grueling to figure out why ""Goldfinger"" became such a well-known classic and why it set standards especially in the spy movie genre but summed it was, in my opinion, the first real ""Bond"" and is even today in a world overloaded with movies which dispose of a budget of over 100. mill $, one of my favorite movies.",Goldfinger

Sure,Goldfinger is the movie that perfected the Bond formula. It's the movie that made James Bond an event. But it isn't necessarily the best because of it. Sure it has many iconic stuff and scenes. ""No,Mr.Bond I expect you to die!"" Pussy Galore,the car,the very first time Bond uttered the ""Martini,shaken not stirred"" line. I'll give you all that. But in my opinion,From Russia With Love wipes the floor with Goldfinger. It has a terrific plot and I find everything about the movie to be superb. it has that essence of espionage that Goldfinger doesn't have that much. So,is this movie in the top 5 Bond movies? Yes,definitely-it is the most iconic Bond movie. But is it the best? No.In my opinion it is not.",Goldfinger
377,glenxxvi,bond three is number one,9,15 June 2007,"i have seen all 21 of the James bond films loads of times and after going through them over and over again i have come to the conclusion that this one is the best. i first saw this in about 1990 when aged 9 and i thought it was the best film i had ever seen. (at the time) i had taped it when it came on TV and i liked it so much i had to watch it over and over again, after i first saw it i watched it once a day for about a week. i had seen about two or three other bond films before and although i liked them this one was far better. i made it my business to see all the other bonds, not realising that there were 16 at the time but when i got round to seeing them all, although they were good in their own way they couldn't come close to this (except for about two that i can think of). up to this point each bond film was better than the last, it's a pity this didn't continue to be the case because although thunderball is alright it doesn't come up to the standards of this one. goldfinger wins because, when you compare it to other bond films it stands head and shoulders above them, although a couple of other bond films aren't far behind. although some things seem far-fetched (oddjob crushing the golf ball etc) it doesn't matter. it is entertaining and fast paced, especially for a film over 40 years old, it still holds up well today. as far as bonds go to this day goldfinger has never been bettered and may never be.",Goldfinger
378,jstachler,The best Bond film made,10,1 December 2003,"Although it is not perfect, ""Goldfinger"" works perfectly on nearly every level. It is what a Bond film should be: exciting and fun, with fantastic characters and sets. Sean Connery is at his most confident and relaxed. One senses with his performance that he was still having fun in the role (probably for the last time). This is one of the few times that the script is better than the novel. The story is streamlined into a more coherent and fast-paced narrative. For screenwriting enthusiasts, this script provides a perfect example of a three act screenplay with strong plot points. Entertaining dialogue as well, including some of the best trademark one-liners of the series (""Shocking.""). Memorable characters are well-cast and portrayed on the right note, particularly Gert Frobe as Auric Goldfinger, who casually dismisses Bond's concern of killing thousands with, ""American motorists kill that many every two years."" The friendly mutual loathing between Bond and Goldfinger carries the film within minutes of the first reel. Other memorable characters include Odd Job and Pussy Galore, who combine to keep Bond in check and attempt to ensure Goldfinger's success. The Aston Martin DB5 stole the show. Ingenious gadget modifications include oil slick, machine guns behind the headlights, and passenger ejector seat which provides a once-in-a-life-time ride. The Fort Knox set by Ken Adam glitters, as does the score by John Barry and title song performed by Shirley Bassey. The image of the golden girl, a beautiful female completely painted gold as a gruesome means of murder, remains one of the most recognizable and memorable depictions in the history of cinema. The main imperfection in this film is with the special effects, particularly the shots of small private jets in flight. With less than two hours running time, this film hasn't an ounce of fat on it. It is no wonder this film is widely regarded as the peak in the series, with a legacy the producers have struggled to match since.",Goldfinger

The film set the standard formula that every Bond after would follow.If your a James Bond fan, there's no doubt you've already seen this movie a million times, but if you are new to 007 or if you tire of the new over the top Bond adventures, then I suggest you rent Goldfinger on DVD10 stars",Goldfinger

We don't watch James Bond for the science though. There is a reason Sean Connery is, and always will be, the best James Bond. He's not just a pretty face like Brosnan and Moore. He can actually act unlike Dalton. He isn't just a gun toting lunatic like Craig. In all fairness, all the James Bonds (including Lazenby but not Dalton) did well in at least one movie. (Connery also did one of the worst Bond movies, Thunderball.) Goldfinger is the best of the series for one reason: he does spy things. The later movies tend to focus around the neat things his car can do. Goldfinger has plenty of action for its time, and one of the best bad guys ever, but there is actual deep plot here.

Many important film sagas were trilogies and the ""James Bond"" series risked to be limited to this small number that three is. But ""Goldfinger"" changed it all. It was not an ending, it was a continuation, and a quite, quite good one: seductive women (also with double-entendre names), bizarre henchmen (quite an... odd job), memorable music, a silver-coloured Aston Martin DB5 coupé filled with gadgets first shown in Q's weird laboratory, a pre-title ""mini-adventure"" introducing 007 to the audience, an implied communist plot behind a megalomaniac villain's evil plan: it has been described as the stereotypical ""Bond"" film, well, it has also been the first one to feature all of this...",Goldfinger
382,David007,"Definitely NOT the best Bond movie, but rather good indeed!",7,10 September 1998,"Certainly the most famous Bond movie in the entire series, GOLDFINGER is also often regarded as the best 007 movie ever. To me, it's one of the worst. Of course, Sean Connery is great (although I prefer Roger Moore), Guy Hamilton's direction is fine, the production design is impressive and John Barry's music is efficient; there are excellent scenes (the precredits sequence, playing golf, spying the factory, the laser beam, the fight with Oddjob)...I'm not saying GOLDFINGER is a bad movie, it's even a good one (as a Bond fan, I give it about 7.5 ou of 10) but it has many flaws, especially about pace: it's rather fast in the beginning, then slows down in the middle, and is fast again in the end. Pussy Galore is not very attractive and a little bit too old. And Goldfinger himself appears caricatural. And the raid on Fort Knox is not believable. But, on the whole, it works. The plot is logical and interesting. And most important, GOLDFINGER displays the famous formula that will be used in every subsequent Bond movie.",Goldfinger

384,nathaniel-04908,A mixed bag that I'm somewhat surprised is as loved as it is.,5,11 August 2020,"In 1964 the third James Bond film Goldfinger was released. Goldfinger is directed by Guy Hamilton and based off of a book of the same name by Ian Fleming. It was a smashing success at the time and is still considered to be among the best Bond films. This is not without reason, for the is a lot to love in Goldfinger, but the worst of the franchise is on display right along with the best of it.
Easily the best part of Goldfinger is the titular villain. I consider him to be the quintessential Bond foe. Smothering people with gold paint, a dramatic lair with an industrial laser, menacing speeches, and an excellent plan, what's not to love? Even his lead henchman Oddjob is memorable and fun. It's not all perfect though, there are a lot of things that don't make sense. Partway through the film he calls a bunch of people to his lair, tells them his entire plan (with Bond snooping of course), and then asks them if they want in. All except for one agree. The one outlier is promptly dispatched of, but he gasses the others as well. This begs the question: if he just wanted them dead, why lay out his plan to them? Of course, the real reason is so that Bond can overhear, but it's frustrating to watch. And why would he have the one woman who he knows singlehandedly foiled his entire plan fly his getaway plane unsupervised?
Goldfinger is also Q's film debut, and they really go all out with the awesome gadgetry. Hidden trackers and similar items are used to great effect, and any scene with the Aston Martin in it is bound to be awesome. In many ways, this film is as responsible as Dr. No for the James Bond we know and love today.
Where Goldfinger fails the most is in its main supporting character, Pussy Galore. It frankly baffles me that she is known as one of the best Bond girls, because for as weak as their characters often are, Goldfinger is probably the only real example of actual sexism. For the first time in a Bond film that a lady doesn't want to sleep with him, he quite literally forces himself on her, and as a result she is so charmed by him that she switches sides, stops Goldfinger's entire plan, and then hooks up with Bond. Whereas in other Bond films the female characters are just poorly written, in this one it's downright disgusting. While I think that the accusations of sexism in the Bond films are often unfair, in this particular film it is incredibly egregious.
Goldfinger is, to me, the most disappointing Bond film. It has one of the best villains with one of the best plots, and many of the action scenes are top notch. It is one of the most memorable Bond films, and there is so much to love, but there is equally as much to hate. The story is relatively easy to poke holes in, and the sexism is nearly unbearable. Goldfinger is a mixed bag if I've ever seen one.",Goldfinger
385,Ian Fleming,One of the Definitive Bond Films!,9,28 February 2002,"Goldfinger signaled that Bond was a true success, theaters stayed open 24 hours a day to show it! Now if that is not an incentive to see it i dont know what is. It does have a few weak spots that only gives it a bronze on my bond list. The villain is not that believable, but he does have a truly fantastic sheme. Another flaw is celic Linder as Felix Leiter. He is too old and well old fashioned to be bonds friend. Finally is that Connery lost some of that hard edge that was present in the first two outings and was thus overshadowed by an awsome story and cast. However, the Aston Martin, Pussy Galore, Oddjob, and the enormous other successful attributes in this film are always more than evident. What a great movie this is!!",Goldfinger
386,perryman-65758,No woman can resist Bond cue eyeroll,4,21 October 2021,"After watching the first 2 amazing films that were quite grounded. This is definitely in full fledged bond cheese mode with big car chases action set peices and silly plot holes and laser beams. I actually don't understand all of the high scores.This whole thing is based on women being attracted to bond. What cologne is he wearing? Its just ridiculous. None of them can resist.What I will say that is the way he treats and uses women like playthings in the film really gives him a deplorable edge which is refreshing to see a film not be shackled down as much by politically correct madness.However the whole film more or less relies on women being attracted to him to for plot progress to be made.Also pussy galore who is a pretty good villain, she is smart and organised and what is this? A woman who doesn't just fall to bonds knees as soon as he speaks...... until she betrays goldfinger and is literally the only reason his plan fails because...... 1. Plot convenice 2. She wants to bang bond...... nevermind what I said.Also why would you tell your plan to a bunch of mafia bosses only so that he can kill them. Oh that's right it is just so that bond can listen in and write down the details.Also pussy didn't shoot bond on the plane because she was warned and seemed to know about cabin decompression. Bond warns goldfinger about it, who is a fairly smart guy. But he just keeps the gun in his and and proceeds to ""accidentally"" shoot the cabins hence getting himself killed for plot convenience.",Goldfinger

Bond is at his best, Auric Goldfinger is a pretty original villain, and Oddjob steals the show with his uncanny hat throwing skills. Terrific entertainment.***** out of *****",Goldfinger
388,mclaughlinconnor338,"Not the worst Bond, but maybe the most disappointing",5,8 September 2013,"Goldfinger is probably the most popular and most beloved Bond movie of the entire series but for some reason it did not do much for me. Do not get me wrong, it was by no means horrible; it was a certainly a decent and watchable flick, but I can't help but feel disappointed by it.The acting is solid enough, with Connery giving a very confident and convincing portrayal of 007, and his usual supporting cast at MI6 doing decent jobs as well. Gert Frobe was also quite good as goldfinger. In addition there are some great one-liners, a memorable henchman in Oddjob, the introduction of the fully equipped Aston Martin, a great pre-credits sequence with the explosion and fight at the Caribbean party, and the theme song, performed by Shirley Bassey is one of the best in the entire movie series. Certainly Goldfinger has some of the greatest moments in Bond history, so where does it go wrong?While Goldfinger essentially invented the now standard ""fun"" Bond blueprint that everyone knows and loves (the crazed villain, the cheesy one liners, the tricked out car, the gadgets, the epic battle at the end, Bond bedding girls left and right throughout the picture, etc.), it all feels strangely pedestrian when compared to the later pictures that nailed the crowd-pleaser style of Bond movie. Goldfinger's biggest crime is that it is just rather dull and uninteresting most of the time. Instead of taking the viewer to marvel at some of the most beautiful locations in the world, most of this movie takes place in Kentucky (although Geneva was cool). The fight scenes are mostly clumsy, except for the one in the beginning. Instead of saving the day, Bond basically just sits in jail most of the time and lets other people do the work for him (he did not even defuse the bomb at Fort Knox). Goldfinger is a transition between the earlier Fleming inspired movies, and the later more outrageous ones without having the benefits of either. There is no sense of danger or suspense in the entire movie; mainly because Auric Goldfinger was one of the lamest, and most nonthreatening villains in Bond history, and add to the fact that his motives were vague and unclear, it is easy not to care about the plot of the movie or its outcome. At the same time it lacks the balls of the later flicks that had over the top ninja battles in Volcanoes, or Bond fighting a seven- foot behemoth while falling out of a plane with no parachute. Goldfinger had a mildly exciting car chase, and the likewise somewhat stimulating finale on the jet. There really is not much more to say. Goldfinger is a decent, but highly disappointing Bond flick. I personally found Dr. No to be far more interesting and suspenseful than anything in this movie, and also From Russia With Love ,and You Only Live Twice, and Thunderball, and Live and Let Die, and The Spy Who Loved Me, and Moonraker, and For Your Eyes Only, and Octopussy (yes even that one, at least it was more fun and had better action, even if it did have a similar plot) and even Goldeneye (though I thought it was kind of weak too).",Goldfinger

391,jgwinz,Best 007 movie I've seen,9,25 August 2006,"How can it get any better? James Bond meets Goldfinger (who's out to contaminate the US's gold supply & thereby raise the value of HIS gold)) & Oddjob the hard way. After Bond & Goldfinger's ""girl"", Jill Masterson hook up for an evening of ""fun, James Bond style"" (Bond to Felix on the phone ""No, I can't make it...something big's come up"") he winds up being hit on the head with a bottle Dom Perignon '53, (which is not to be served above the temp of 38 degrees), & Jill winds up dead...& painted gold! From that point on, 007 finds himself in more than a scrape or two with Goldfinger & Oddjob (and glamorous Pussy Galore)as he tries to stop ""Operation Grandslam"", but in the end, he saves the day & gets the girl. Of all Bond movies I've seen (& I've seem most of them), this one just hits it. It has funny moments, tense moments, great scenery (Switzerland), cool gadgets, etc. Watch & enjoy!",Goldfinger
392,delamericano,Best Bond ever!,10,15 February 2007,"Even if you are not a Bond-Fan, this is a must-see for all film-freaks. Sean Connery shows once more that he is the one and only true Bond. Even if some of the other Bond actors are good ones too (Especially Pierce Brosnan, and the new 007 Daniel Craig), Connery is the only one who combines the charme and wit of an authentic Womanizer with the harshness of a killer in her Majesty's secret service. Connery is Bond, James Bond(despite he is one of the greatest actors as well). The plot is (how in most Bond movies) told very fast: The movie begins with an action scene in Columbia. After the credits, Bond receives (as usual) his assignment at the headquarter of the British secret service. For this he has to make the acquaintanceship of Goldfinger (Bad German Gerd Fröbe, in another great performance). The rest is told really fast: A lot of action, sexy girls (like Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore, probably a name most feminists wouldn't use for the female in a motion picture) and black humour. The point why this Bond is the Best is not the plot (Who cares about the plot in a Bond movie anyway... I mean, he always wins... Doesn't matter how mean the villains and how sexy the girls are). No, the real reason why this one is the Best, is the fact that this movie has everything what you expect when you go in a Bond movie: a lot of action, sexy girls, Cold war atmosphere, a sleazy but charismatic villain (like in most Bond movie it is either a German, a Chinese or a Russian guy... this time it's a German with a Chinese pal), very eccentric ways how this bad boys die, a grim sense of humour, nice cars, Q's gimmicks, Wodka-Martini and at last but not least a Sean Connery at his best. If you don't like this Bond, you won't like the other ones!",Goldfinger
393,Dble07jamesbond,The best of the series,10,22 July 2002,"I myself being quite possibly one of the largest James Bond fanatics this planet has come to known, would recommend this movie tenfold in comparison to the many other wonderful entries in this never-dying series. Sean Connery stars as the ultimate James Bond in this 1964 classic of the usual ego-galactic maniac wishing to take over the world.  I might recognize that some entries in the James Bond series have not been any milestones in the movie business, but I can guarantee that the finesse of Goldfinger set a precedent in this genre of action film.      To begin with, we have the perfect character.  Sean Connery played the image of the cinematic Bond the best.  [Timothy Dalton was the closest we got to the original Ian Fleming literary character].  In the beginning ""teaser"", we see the character of James Bond completely--with no strings attached.  He is tough, rough, and after he does his duty--ever so smoothly pulls off a wetsuit to reveal a 1,000$+ suit.  As he goes into the local bar he sits himself down ever so slightly, checks his watch, and feels the explosion next door that he created.  As everyone screams and panics--we see James Bond.  Sean Connery's expression is timeless at this part when we see him so easily light his cigarette and press on as if it didn't phase him in the least.  Afterwards, he returns to his room where he meets a girl, passionately kisses her, only to fight a man who snuck up behind him.  As the fight continues, he electrocutes the man and simply states the classic ""shocking....positively shocking"".  Now what more do you have to hear about James Bond?  There is humor, lust, fighting, and gadgets all in this 7 odd minute teaser.  This beginning sets the stage for a movie we know will be entertaining.      As the movie progresses we are introduced to the best Bond villain: Auric Goldfinger, whom is brilliantly portrayed by the German actor Gert Frobe.  Bond has a run in with, in my opinion, the best looking Bond girl to date: Shirley Eaton, who plays one of Goldfinger's accomplices.  It is a shame that this beauty had to leave so early in the film at the hand of the mysterious henchman, Oddjob, we first see as a shadow in the film.  When we finally see Oddjob, we get the impression that he is practically harmless; a mute servant whose height is laughable in the presence of Bond's power. However, after we see a lethal toss of his bowler hat, which cuts off the head on a statue--we see that Oddjob has a little aid with him; not to mention the fact we learn he is quite strong, after he crushes Bond's golf ball with his bare hands.  The characters of Oddjob and Goldfinger both make for an excellent pairing of evil in the movie, unparalleled in any of the other Bond pictures.      Pussy Galore, who is introduced as the main Bond girl of the film also has a wonderful part--and certainly meets the expectations of what a Bond beauty is.  Her chemistry with Sean is superb, and you can certainly see the lust of this fling in Bond's ""romantic"" life. Goldfinger has it all--from the best villain of the series, to one of the best girl's of the series, to certainly the best car of the series--which must not be forgotten.  The Aston Martin DB5 is truly the essential Bond car (given to by Q, who has one of the funniest confrontations with Bond in the series).  Beautiful in appearance, deadly in action.  Watch in the sequence when Bond is speeding through the factory of Goldfinger.  The camerawork when it follows the car is superb.  I still get chills watching and listening to the engine of that beauty. If you want to watch sheer entertainment, watch Goldfinger.  If you want to see a great advance in the action film, watch Goldfinger.  And if you want to see the best movie of the 19 James Bond films, watch Goldfinger. You will not be disappointed, and you will be on the edge of your seat from the point Bond steps out of the water in the beginning, to the hair-raising climax in Fort Knox.  10 stars for Goldfinger (coming from one of the largest James Bond know-it-all's in the world)  :)",Goldfinger
394,T-eschberger,Completely overrated.,4,1 January 2009,"I respect Goldfinger for what it did for film and I respect thats its also the most important Bond film as far as formula goes, but I just cant help but feel completely confused by its popularity.Connery is pretty much the only highlight of the film. Goldfinger lacks the suspense and intrigue Dr. No and From Russia With Love had as well as the well staged action. The plot of Goldfinger, while good on paper, is executed without any type of suspense or build up. Everything just sort of ""happens"". Goldfinger himself is also highly overrated as a villain. Even the most cartoonish of villains like Scaramanga and Drax feel more threatening than Goldfinger. Another overrated aspect in my eyes is Pussy Galore. Whats so great about her? She does next to nothing the whole film and she is regard as one of, if not the best Bond girl. I guess its just the name.All in all I find Goldfinger completely un-remarkable. It lacks the suspense and well executed plot of the previous two films and the sheer fun later films had.5/10",Goldfinger
395,pbierre-196-478482,A genius musical score & soundtrack,10,4 February 2015,"The year is 1964, and Goldfinger sets an entirely new bar for musical soundtrack. John Barry was the major composer. Let's start with the theme song, sung by Shirley Bassey, which made the pop charts on its own strength -- the unconventional chord progression helps build the mystique of the nemesis Goldfinger. In the movie, we've already opened with Bond fighting his way out of some Mexican standoff by throwing a lamp into his adversary's bathtub -- ""shocking, simply shocking"". Then the title hit Goldfinger. Then cut Miami Beach....a splash of a diver into the pool at the Founainbleu kicks off John Barry's jazzy 3/4 tempo instrumental, which is dripping with sexual libido....we're in Bond's hang. Barry's soundtrack perfectly sets the mood...Bond's mood...every bikini-clad chick hanging by the pool a potential pleasure. Obviously this is a masterpiece of 60s cinema...acting, storytelling, sets....but the score takes everything else to a new level, communicating mood with extraordinary timing and control.A particularly brilliant transition occurs during the Fort Knox counter-assault, when the U.S. Army, who were alerted to the plot, come to life and begin the counterassault. Barry signals the shift of fortune, again brilliantly, with his upbeat cadence, its military-sounding precision with piccolos pacing the assault over the next 5 minutes. The music tells the emotional side of the story.John Barry did receive an Oscar nomination for the musical score, and Norm Wanstall won an Oscar for the best sound effects and special effects.When I think of movie scores & musical soundtracks, Goldfinger defines the highest art. The catchiness of Bond theme is as fresh today as it was 50 years ago when first heard.",Goldfinger
396,danielstefulic-71531,"""I must be dreaming...""",10,8 March 2017,"The third is a charm, as it proves ""Goldfinger"", the great third installment of James Bond franchise!With Guy Hamilton hopping in as a director and John Barry accompanying him in making the movie, they made no mistake!James Bond (Sean Connery) is sent to investigate the gold smuggling led by Auric Goldfinger (Gert Fröbe). What simply is supposed to be a gold smuggling, it's much more dastardly and a really great villain scheme, Operation Grand Slam! Bond not only has to fight Goldfinger but his deadly and memorable henchman Oddjob (Harold Sakata). Bond gets to meet the girl who'd be measured as a equal, Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman)!James Bond goes across Mexico, Miami, United Kingdom, Switzerland all the way to Fort Knox, Kentucky to prevent Goldfinger from his deadly scheme! Is Goldfinger the villain that's so memorable that doesn't hesitate to kill Bond?The pre-title sequence is solid at its' best, but that reflection in the girl's eye is a bit ridiculous in my opinion. But wait... there's the first theme song sang beautifully by Shirley Bassey! Desmond Llewelyn has been finally credited as Q in this movie, showing his basement and introducing us to the iconic Aston Martin DB5.Shirley Eaton and Tania Mallet portray Jill and Tilly Masterson as two of Bond Girls, but the ultimate Bond girl is Pussy Galore, who's tough, knows Judo and doesn't succumb to Bond's charm until the end of the movie! Gert Fröbe is so amazing as Auric Goldfinger and his scheme is brilliant even by today's standards. Would you believe it that he was dubbed by Michael Collins? Harold Sakata is awesome in his role as a mute Oddjob, who's also able to defy the pain when James throws a gold bar at his chest. We have Felix Leiter back again, but this time recast with Cec Linder, who does his work pretty well and helps James to prevent Goldfinger's scheme.Goldfinger is indeed a great film, introducing us to the gadgets, humor, one liners and many other things Bond fans desire. Sean Connery's performance is really great!5 out of 5 stars!",Goldfinger
397,Ant-Roy,the best Bond... James Bond,9,30 June 1999,"Goldfinger is, in spite of the huge sums of money spent on the few last ones, the best Bond ever, and will certainly, if the directors keep on the ""Action-Fun-Humor"" way, stay it. First, it is useless to say it another time, but there will never be another actor as great as Sean in this part, because he had everything to be Bond. In fact, he is Bond. Pierce is surely great (better than George, Timothy or, hum, what's his name, Roger ""I am an actor, look how I play with my eyebrow"" Moore), but he can only see Sean's ankle. Then, the story of Goldfinger is great, and the famous gadgets are quite simple but terribly efficient for the fun of the spectator. The ugly is (with Walken (but it was with Roger) and Pryce) the best bad guy ever seen in a Bond movie, and look at his partner and his hat. Great ! Then, this is maybe the cleverest Bond movie, as it is playing with several aspects the recent directors are forgetting. It is not innocent to end with Bond, alone in Fort Knox. And in 1964, wasn't it courageous to present a female fantasy (and, well, Honor Blackman has everything to be it) as a lesbian, named Pussy ? The action is, as always, here (see the scene on the golf course, i love it), the bondgirls are, hum, quite nice, Sean is here, and so is the humor. What could we ask for more ?",Goldfinger
398,Mott-2,The ultimate 007 adventure.,9,5 January 1999,"This is the movie everyone should think of when they think about James Bond. It's a quintessential '60s period piece that defined the character of 007, and the spy film genre. ""Goldfinger"" shows a Bond that is fully fleshed out by Sean Connery in his third outing as the indestructible agent--touches of humor, anger and bemusement all rise to the surface in this performance; his James Bond is a credible, multi-faceted person. Other high watermarks featured here are the superb title theme (sung by Shirley Bassey) and soundtrack (composed by John Barry), and the wonderfully drawn villains Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) and Oddjob (Harold Sakata)--both of whom inspire legions of evildoers and their henchmen to this day. Also, this is the movie where Bond got to fully explore the gadgetry of his incredible Aston Martin DB5, which became yet another archetype of the secret agent flick.",Goldfinger
399,stevejolival,Best of all Bonds,10,28 November 2003,"3 things make this movie great...First, Shirley Bassey's title song is the best opening song of any of the Bond movies (and she's the only singer to sing on 2 different 007 films) (Nancy Sinatra's You Only Live Twice is a close second.)  Bassey's music also appears during the closing credits.Second, Honor Blackman is one of the best Bond girls ever...blond, blue-eyed, what a beauty!Third, during the scene where the 5 fantastic shapely blonds in their tight jump suits fly their planes over Fort Knox to gas the soldiers, listen closely for that great Goldfinger theme with the piccolo up-and-down staccato and great bass line.",Goldfinger
400,villeneuveg_27,Best Bond film of all,10,16 December 2003,"This was the film that made the world fall in love with James Bond. It has a tight plot, a hero so cool that ice is warmer than him, a villain who loves being a villain, an indestructible henchman and an appeal that most other Bond films can only live up to, but never better.Auric Goldfinger is in love with gold, and is suspected of smuggling the stuff with his Rolls Royce. The British Government assign Bond to follow and gain evidence on Goldfinger, and if possible to stop him. Sounds simple enough, but this being a Bond film it's never simple. Goldfinger has several attractive women (birds really) to keep Bond entertained and also has Oddjob to dispose of any threat to Goldfinger himself.Goldfinger has more moments in it that are legend than most of the other Bond films put together. The (at the time) jaw-dropping Aston Martin, Oddjob's steel-rimmed hat, the pre-title scene where Bond blows up a drug empire and then gets into a fight to the death before electrocuting his attacker: ''Shocking. Positively shocking.'' And of course the scene where Goldfinger is about to take away Bond's ability to procreate: ''No, Mr. Bond. I expect you to die!!''Connery is in top form, suave and witty and looking as if he was born to play the role, he is also the only actor to play Bond that when he gets tough it looks real. Gert Frobe is great as Goldfinger and gets most of the best lines in the film. Goldfinger is also one of the shortest Bonds, so ordinary people won't get bored easily.A real classic, and should be on anyone who is a film lover's Top 100 list.",Goldfinger
401,IForgotOneSixThousandthOfThePie,Amazing Bond movie,8,3 January 2016,"This masterpiece is one of the best Bond movies.After a really bad Bond movie,this one exceeded the greatness of even the really great Dr. No before it.One of the best Bond villains(and henchmen) and an amazing plot that's more focused than From Russia With Love.This is,not surprisingly,one of the most famous Bond films.Great acting and a great Bond can go a long way.Eon Productions has made better Bond movies,but this one was still amazing and would probably be in my Top 10(if I were to write that down).The cast and crew did a wonderful job on Goldfinger,very few Bond movies are better than it!A masterpiece of a Bond movie!",Goldfinger
402,professor_blah_blahson,Incredible,10,28 August 2005,"Many things make this one of the greatest Bond films. One is the use of the Aston Martin DB5. Another is that it is the first use of Q, who is one of the greatest characters in the series. Also, it is the first one where Bond uses ingenious gadgets which would fill the minds of people aged 5 to 500 for generations to come.The plot is much better than that of some of the earlier Bond films, with SPECTRE (SPecial Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion) having been abandoned for a villain essentially attempting a giant bank robbery. It also features some of the first truly larger-than-life (for the time, anyway) inventions, such as Goldfinger's Industrial Laser (which is used to torture Bond after capture by Goldfinger's guards). The characters are some of the most original to have emerged from the series, such as Oddjob (Goldfinger's Korean butler).Whatever your taste in films is, there will be something in Goldfinger which you will like, so I would absolutely recommend it to everyone and anyone.",Goldfinger

James Bond ( Sean Connery) in disguise wearing a strap on plastic seagull on his head.It's a Roger Moore Bond movie nine years before Roger Moore! I love the ludicrous Bond movies such as Goldfinger and Octopussy - two of my favorites. Octopussy has Roger Moore riding a plastic crocodile and Goldfinger has Sean Connery wearing a strap on plastic seagull hat!Thunderball, a year later, continued the ludicrous fun with Connery's Bond riding a jet pack and fighting cross dressing assassins.It's a shame that in 2006, the franchise died and became something utterly bland with the advent of the Craig era.",Goldfinger

There are quite a few great Bond movies, but none of them clearly beat out the others. Anyways, this movie has it all.

The dialogues are intelligent, funny and not as much over the top as they are in today's Bond movies, the action was spectacular for those times, the Aston Martin DB7 of course is the most famous Bond gadget ever and can still be bought as models (I don't believe that is possible with any stupid satellites or Moonraker space stations or whatsoever).Sorry, just writing this, because I just could not accept the comment that came up on the start page saying: not as good as the first two.... ridiculous!",Goldfinger

The great James Bond one liners, the gadgets, the girls, the guns. What more can you ask for in a film? I think this particular James Bond film stands the test of time and will go down in history for future generations to come as one of the greats. I think Golfinger has a very special quality about it.

That's the reason behind the phenomenal success of these movies over the last 40 years and soon to be 20 films. 'Goldfinger' is the best example of this.  It's two hours of great lines, car chases, silly names, great baddies, classic scenes, gadgets and cartoon violence - Goldfinger set the tone for all we expect from Bond movies.

The movie itself was quite lacklustre, with no intensity and there were three main aspects in particular that made the movie a disappointment.The first was that Bond was under capture by Goldfinger for the majority of the movie, so he didn't have the freedom to go about his usual 007 business. The second flaw of the movie was that there was no real Bond girl. Pussy Galore ended up with this role, but she only assisted Bond towards the latter stages. The final aspect of the movie that I didn't enjoy was the fact that Bond didn't stop the bomb from exploding; he needed the assistance of the US soldiers to do it for him. This should never occur as James Bond is always the one to save the day. Overall, this movie was quite poor despite the vast majority of people who suggest otherwise.",Goldfinger

Sean Connery's performance is one of his best in the series and Gert Fröbe's performance is equally impressive that not a lot of people realise that he was dubbed. Auric Goldfinger is the ultimate Bond villain - He is ruthless but very very clever. Goldfinger is also memorable among 007 fans because it is the first film in the series that features the character ""Q"".John Barry's score is absolutely fantastic. His soundtrack has some wonderful tracks such as ""Dawn Raid On Fort Knox"". Shirley Bassey does a great job with the title song and the lyrics are brilliant.The famous Austin Martin DB5 with all its gadgets is a highlight of the movie. Other highlights are the golf game between Bond and Goldfinger, and the world-famous laser scene.James Bond: Do You Expect Me To Talk?

You need to rate this film at 10 to compensate all the other people who have bad taste in films. Cheers Del Boy,Goldfinger
421,jeff6342,Best movie ever made.,10,27 February 2008,"I first saw the film when I was 15 y/o. It made a big impression and I wasn't satisfied until I had seen the other Bond films. All the Sean Connery films were great, my least favorite being You Only Live Twice. Goldfinger had everything: beautiful women, great locations, terrific cars, a few airplanes. What else could you want? I've probably seen it no less than 30 times and I'll watch it again whenever it comes on. The Bond series deserves respect for the number of sequels it spawned; most films can't produce more than one or two sequels until the films become terrible such as Jaws, for instance. I've tried watching the Pierce Brosnan versions but I have never been able to sit through one.",Goldfinger
422,jgraley,Third Bond movie establishes the franchise,8,1 January 2015,"Goldfinger begins in the same spy-movie structure as Dr No and From Russia with Love, but with a little darkish humour and exaggerated reality - characteristics that define the franchise thereafter. Bond disregards his orders and enters into his own game of intellectual one-upmanship with Goldfinger, leaving a now-conventional trail of destruction behind him.This is Sean Connery's peak performance as Bond - he begins to lose involvement after this movie. Gert Fröbe displays pleasing range as the insane antagonist, contrasting Harold Sakata's bone dry henchman.John Barry's music and the general sound of the film ooze metallic-ness and gold-ness, and this theme pays off nicely in the end game.This is the movie people think of when they say that the Sean Connery movies were the best, and I recommend it to anyone who has only seen more recent ones and is ambivalent about the whole series.8 out of 10",Goldfinger

424,bmarkrabwin,gold finger,10,26 September 2006,"there is no question: gold finger is,without any doubt in my mind,and always will be the 'finest' film of the entire James bond series. many times the greatness of an impending movie is eagerly announced by the thrilling opening score,and in this case,that is certainly 'legendary'.not for nothing did 'cubby' broccoli select the great Shirley Bassey to do not just this one, (gold finger) but the opening songs to three separate bond films. theme to 'gold finger',in my estimation,is also the greatest of the bond opening themes. kudos to the great Shirley Bassey for this classic,powerful rendition.the swinging sixties 'jazzy' opening to this superlative movie also sets one up for what you just know is going to be a thrilling ride.the panoramic 'sweep' of Miami beach and the fabulous, 'fountainbleu'hotel,one of the worlds most beautiful hotels at that time, suggest terrific movie fare ahead,and this film 'never' disappoints.this is the 'third' outing for the greatest James bond that ever will be,Sean Connery, and we have had three others,all good,mind you, but none of the latter can touch him or his unique,suave manner that delineated the image of bond in the movies, immediately,since doctor no..there is 'no' improving on Mr. Connery! another sign that this film is the best in the series are the unforgettable characters and character development,which is explored and enhanced all during the film. the character, 'q',also,for the first time,is examined in earnest, and the beginnings of the tremendous,sometimes friendly,sometimes antagonistic interplay between he and James bond are first honed to maximum future effect in this movie.then there is the Aston martin db5, which, by itself, would be enough to solidly place this in the greatest lists. this was,is,and always will be 'the ' car in a bond film. speaking as a 'then, child of 8 years old,words totally fail me to describe the feeling i got when first seeing this classic on the big screen,those (hard to believe) 42 long years ago.it has stood the test of time with me, and i still get a chill and that 'spark' of nostalgia when hearing much of the fabled dialog which proliferates throughout the movie.yes...to my mind, and to many other James bond devotees,this is certainly the greatest of the James bond series,by far,and i haven't even mentioned pussy galore,Oddjob or the most classic part of the film, the laser beam scene with gold finger about to do away with our favorite secret agent,and the incredibly memorable dialog that leads up to it! gold finger delights the senses in so many ways,and thrills in so many ways to such an extent that (and i have known this for 42 years,now) they will never be able to combine elements,characters,plot, great music and skill enough in the future to ever supplant this great masterpiece of a film from being what it is, and always will be, the absolute greatest James bond film of all ! -- Brad Savage film historian --",Goldfinger
425,fernandom06,Best James Bond Movie!,8,28 April 2003,"Many of the infamous scenes associated with James Bond originate from this movie such as the gadget-filled car, the ""laser"" on the table scene, invading Fort Knox for its gold, and the Korean ""bowler hat"" killer. Sean Connery also delivers some of the best one-liners ever and the entire movie's dialogue is filled with clever little anecdotes.",Goldfinger
426,snash93,Awesome Bond film!,10,27 June 2010,"The third issue of the James Bond series, Goldfinger, hit the cinemas with a huge expectation following the success of its predecessors From Russia with Love and Dr.No and it didn't disappoint. Goldfinger was the first of four Bond movies Guy Hamilton directed and with a budget of $3million and the gross revenue being $124.9million, it is safe to say that it was the crown jewel of his career and of the James Bond franchise.The film has a rather basic storyline of how Goldfinger plans to raid Fort Knox and become the richest man in the world and Bond sets out to thwart him. Though the storyline may have been nothing special but the film's use of iconography and presentation that made it outshine other Bond issues. Unlike the more recent Bond films such as Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace etc, Goldfinger has that James Bond feel to it. What I mean by this is that the newer Bond issues lack the conventions, which made it successful and unique for example there isn't as much use of gadgets in newer Bond films. I mean you have a beautiful Aston Martin DB5 and not only has it got the speed, but those gadgets within it which Bond can utilise when he is in a chase scene, that can help make it epic and breathtaking. This was shown very well in this film as Bond can shoot from using in his car, track villains down, and one particular gadget, the ejector seat, which simple but effective and amusing. There is something else which also stands out in this film and which is decreased in the newer Bond films and that is clichés. For me I think it is a huge mistake of not utilising clichés in up coming Bond films, as you look in modern times, we can watch so many films of the action/adventure genre, who now also use the similar conventions such as the gadgets, the fast cars etc, that you would want a film which is unique on its own. This is where I feel clichés are really important and how it shows this film having that James Bond feel than of Quantum of Solace for example. One real famous cliché, which is used in this film, is when Sean Connery's character says ""The names Bond. James Bond"". The use of clichés in this film like the one I just quoted can show the iconic status of James Bond. The acting in Goldfinger was absolutely superb especially of Sean Connery and Gert Frobe, who both had unique characters and were the perfect match in the antagonist and protagonist. This film displayed Auric Goldfinger as a real legitimate threat and as a sadistic psychopath. There is a famous scene which shows this aspect of his character where a laser beam is about cut Bond in half, James says ""Do you expect me to talk, Goldfinger?"" to which Goldfinger replies ""No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!"". In the following moments we see Bond worried and I feel this can allow us to recognise Auric Goldfinger as a powerful enemy and as an equal to Bond. The fact that we see James Bond anxious is very rare in the franchise as he has a very strong screen presence and there is an expectation of him being the powerful, authoritative figure. With this expectation, the franchise shows itself as a fairytale and the film also displays this. The character of Bond shows to be a resilient hero that defeats the bad guy and saves the world. But the earlier Bond character, which was acted by Sean Connery, Roger Moore, showed wit and humour which so dearly lacks now. Now that we distinguished the traits and personality of the good character and the bad character, what else does every evil, manipulative villain need in the James Bond franchise? For those who haven't guessed it, there is one word, which I'm looking and that's henchman. Henchmen's play a huge part in the Bond film chain (Stamper, Tee Hee and Gobinda to name a few) as they are presented as the unstoppable force that 007 has to fight. The main henchman in this film is Oddjob who is played by Harold Sakata and to be quite honest with you, he is my favourite henchman throughout the whole series. The reason being is that he is silent, manservant of Goldfinger but is a ruthless killer and ends up having an epic battle with James Bond, who has to use his intelligence and resiliency to defeat the Korean born wrecking machine. As always every Bond film needs Bond girls! Now first of all I would like us to consider the fact that Goldfinger was made in 1964, so naturally back then, the female gender was seen as the inferior sex however that did not stop the persistent use of sexual innuendo but it isn't as explicit as it used in the more recent Bond movies. The main Bond girl in this film goes by the name of Pussy Galore (note the strong use of innuendo in the name!), but she isn't the stereotypical Bond girl that gets taken in by 007. When we see her first meet James Bond, there is a clear indication that she will not be seduced and she is playing hard to get. With this we can make the clear assumption that she is not the stereotypical female, and to emphasise this further, in the film her profession is a pilot and she also has learnt judo, thus revealing the masculine nature in the character, evidently summing up why she isn't easily taken in by Bond. Eventually however, she falls for him and again it's mainly about Bond's character, his wit, his bravery, and his intelligence. Having such characteristics is sure to woo even the likes of Galore.",Goldfinger
427,LarryDimmick,The Best Bond Film,10,19 November 2003,"This is an excellent entry in the Bond Franchise and is quite possibly the best of the bunch.  It is only really rivaled by From Russia With Love and On Her Majesty's Secret Service. This is the first time we really see the ""Bond Formula"" in action: cool car, outrageous villain, girl with sexual innuendo name etc. We had seen these in previously in the last two films, but never all in the same one, this just brings it all together. This is a quintessential action film and a must-see for anyone with a passing interest in the bond series",Goldfinger
428,donalsinnott,Not That Great,5,16 May 2015,"I watched this again for the first time in years today and it was a bit of a let down. It doesn't deserve its rating. The film has some great elements. Elements that were truly groundbreaking at the time. The set design is spectacular. The soundtrack is brilliant. And the film on the whole is fun, entertaining and full of endless charm.However it gets let down by the story and the characters, The plot is rarely coherent. The characters are weak. They do illogical things that are completely at odds with who they are supposed to be. The manner in which Goldfinger treats Bond is completely ridiculous. And before you all disregard this review through rose-tinted spectacles you should know that I loved this film and everything about 007 when I was 10. I'm 23 now and I wanted to love this film again, but it just features gaping holes that are hard to ignore. By all means watch it, it'll entertain you, But its by no means a flawless cinematic great.",Goldfinger
429,drh90,"Watch Sean Connery work his magic! If you've ever watched a Bond movie, and this is not it--then, put Goldfinger on your must see list.",8,13 August 2014,"Goldfinger. Some call it the best of Bond movies. I'm not sure about that statement, but the action and suspense, and the Bond intrigue alone make it worth the watching. If you're new to Bond movies and you've only seen the latest three in the series—Skyfall, Quantum of Solace, and Casino Royale, you must go back to the building of the Bond character and all that goes with it to understand the James Bond persona. This movie's main genre is a spy, action, thriller, yet after twenty-three Bond movies, I believe that Bond movies alone is a legitimate sub-genre. The Goldfinger movie is classic Bond and a must see. The film begins with the classic, rich, and identifiable Golden Girl song alongside gold-laden dancing Bond girls. Then, within the first thirty minutes the viewer finds Bond interacting with M, his boss and the head of the British Secret Service, and Q, the wizard of all Bond gadgetry. Moneypenny, M's secretary, exchanges some brief, cloaked, flirtatious remarks with Bond. In addition, the Aston Martin is introduced. And, not the least, Bond beds a woman who ends up dead and painted in gold! Thus begins the larger story as Bond works to find out how the psychopath, Auric Goldfinger, sends his gold overseas, illegally. Bond then ultimately discovers that Fort Knox is in danger as the mighty Goldfinger plans to infiltrate this well guarded facility to become the wealthiest gold baron in the world. How he plans to do this and how Bond and crew foil his plan must be seen by watching the film. No spoilers here. Some classic Bond lines appear in this third film in the series that will be used over and over to build the Bond character. When asked what drink he wants, Bond says ""a martini, shaken, not stirred."" More than once when he is asked his name he says, ""Bond, James Bond."" And when Bond asks Goldfinger's personal pilot her name, she openly says Pussy Galore. This use of a double entendre for the names of Bond girls becomes a staple in Bond films. This film moves from Miami Beach to Switzerland to Baltimore and finally Kentucky as Bond chases Goldfinger. (The camera shows off the scenery in Miami and Switzerland as is to be expected in a Bond movie.) Bond is often imprisoned during this long chase. All the while his friends in the CIA are monitoring his moves as much as possible. Bond repeatedly gets out of life threatening situations and somehow avoids the wrath of Oddjob (Goldfinger's manservant) and his slicing hat! Looking back over fifty years of Bond movies, some scenes may seem predictable, yet the formula used for this series must have something going for it as the next Bond movie is currently in the works in 2014! It's hard to find any series that has survived this long. Sean Connery as James Bond, Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore, Gert Frobe as Auric Goldfinger, and Shirly Eaton as Jill Masterson give superb performances as they were nominated for many awards. In the film, Jill Masterson was painted in gold and died of skin suffocation after she betrayed Goldfinger and gave her loyalties to Bond. Her gold, nude body lying on a bed is an iconic movie image. As Goldfinger is watched for the very first time you will see much more in this film to build your Bond IQ. Enjoy!",Goldfinger
430,bennydewachter,"Very, very disappointing",1,6 July 2013,"I saw this movie for a second time yesterday (Friday 5th July 2013) and boy was I again disappointed! Nothing in this movie makes sense. This goes for subplots as well as for the plot in its entirety. I could give a thousand of examples, but just don't where to start. Everything really. Take the 1st appearance of Goldfinger. Seconds after appearing, he is busy cheating with the cards. But, while doing so, he is *very* obviously wearing a headphone so that even to a really uninformed playing partner, his cheating would have to be *very, very* obvious. Yet, in the movie, he gets away with is. A second example (whatever comes to the mind, a 1000 examples are possible, I am sure). Later on, Bond get stupidly caught, and finds himself tight to a table. With a laser gun advancing dangerously towards his vital parts, he does some ""quick thinking"" and says to Goldfinger: ""Can you take that risk?"". Meaning: can Goldfinger, the bad guy, take the risk that his so-called ""Grand Slam""-operation would perhaps be known to a ""back-up"" agent of Bond, because that back-up agent would presumably know as much of this plan as Bond does, that is: nothing at all? Well, Goldfinger, for no good reason at all, decides he can't take that risk. The logical thing to do would have been to ask - for instance - to tell him just *a little bit* more about that plan, even just 1 or 2 words like ""contamination"" or ""Ford Knox"", but no, this so-called brilliant criminal isn't even smart enough to figure that out and decides that Bond is more worth to him alive than dead. And so on and so on ... A *tremendously* overrated movie. For me: 1/10 (even if the late Robert Egbert, whom I usually respect a lot in his ratings and reviews, gives it 4 stars).",Goldfinger
431,pamaajali,I'm Not Sure Why The Reviews Are So Good,2,12 December 2020,"I am not sure why this is regarded as such a good movie. The acting is generally not that great, the story itself is absolutely ridiculous and barely strung together, and the characters themselves are almost laughable. But most importantly, none of the events in the movie seem to flow together in anyway, things just sort of happen one after the other.I suppose this is one of those movies that was/is really important to those who saw it at or near its initial release. However, I find it almost sad that this is in the same family as Dr. No, a film I genuinely enjoyed. As far as I am concerned this is not only a terrible James Bond movie, but just a terrible movie in general.",Goldfinger
432,ajzagelow,Stands the test of time,9,11 November 2019,"Even though this movie is over 50 years old with some special effects that look primitive by today's standards it is still one of the greatest spy movies of all time. Sean Connery is as young and fit as we've ever seen as 007 and Auric Goldfinger is introduced as a classic Bond villain, ""...no Mr. Bond I expect you to die."" Also,
in this movie the viewer gets their first introduction to Bonds Aston Martin DB5, his trademark auto of choice.",Goldfinger
433,DorkfencerX,The Ideal bond film,10,12 January 2006,"Widely proclaimed a THE best Bond movie ever made, This milestone to action films best captures the wit, danger, and secrecy of the bond world. Sean Connery portrays the role of 007 (bond, James bond) flawlessly capturing the exact nuance and style of Ian Fleming's original Secret Agent. Never missing a beat yet rolling with every punch, This godly hero is the perfect secret agent. If there were 1 Bond movie to see, this is the one.perhaps the most notable classic feature Is the Q-gadgets. The ingenious and slightly anal Q (lewllen Desmond) provides Bond with a fantastic tool for his every need. Ranging from tracking-beacon shoes to a super Aston-Martin (with ejector seats, no less) 007 squeezes though many a hard place thanks to his old friend. The other side comes well equipped with lasers, nerve gas, and even a decapitating bowler hat! Action packed scenes are well placed, neither dull or overpowering to the storyline. However, If you only watch movies for guns and explosions, you might be a tad disappointed. Unlike the later films, this is focused on the stealth and subtle but meaningful action. It emphasizes that James bond is a SPY not an all-destroying super weapon of the British government. A well placed false identity or smokescreen is more appreciated than a panzer and a 50-megaton rocket.The Evil ""Evil genius"" goldfinger has an ingenious plan, Not impossibly outrageous as A space colony and doomsday weapons, but not a petty theft. Oh I could gush for hours, but I won't give anything away.So, be you a new viewer or a die-hard Bond fan (I being the latter) This the must-have for any secret agent. Being coined and parodied for decades, this classic should be missing from any collector. You may have trouble finding in stores, but don't let that stop you from seeing THE greatest bond of all time. Like Wal-mart, The net is always open. and e-bay is almost certain to have a spare copy, or any other classic movie dealer. I hope I could help you, make sure you get YOUR goldfingers on this icon of films.",Goldfinger
