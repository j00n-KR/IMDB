0,Leofwine_draca,Too bland,4,3 July 2021,"Another boring Hollywood young adult movie, this time with an Australian feel to it. Once again there's an apocalypse with future humanity hiding out in underground bunkers while giant insects and creatures rampage above ground. Our good looking but ultimately hollow hero goes above ground for a week and has to survive. Seasoned actors like Michael Rooker and Jessica Henwick can bring nothing to two-dimensional roles, while the monsters only occasionally recall the charm of a vintage Harryhausen. A cute dog is present here but that's about all it has going for it.",Love and Monsters
1,SnoopyStyle,fun middle,6,25 October 2020,"Cold-blooded creatures and insects have mutated and grown to monstrous sizes wiping out most of humanity. Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien) has been living in an underground bunker community for the last seven years. He's lonely after getting separated from his girlfriend Aimee (Jessica Henwick). He freezes in stressful situations and is not wanted in any confrontations with the monsters. He decides to head off on his own to Aimee's seaside community. Along the way, he befriended a dog named Boy, and two survivalists Clyde Dutton (Michael Rooker) and Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt).Dylan O'Brien is a charismatic enjoyable lead. The section with Rooker and Greenblatt is a fun winning adventure. That is the best of the movie. The rest is somewhat average at best. It starts with a questionable premise. There is a convoluted info dump leading to a questionable premise in the bunker. There are a few undercooked ingredients in the stew. Once he gets outside and joins others, it can literally breath fresh air. It leads to another problem in the movie. The middle works so well that the last act falls a bit flat. It's a letdown to finish the movie and then there is a ham-fisted suggestion for a sequel. It's a sour note to end on. Overall, Dylan is great, the middle is great, and the rest needs work.",Love and Monsters
2,Prismark10,Love and Monsters,6,22 December 2020,"There are elements of Tremors, A Quiet Place and Zombieland in Love and Monsters.After some missiles were launched in an attempt to shoot down an asteroid. Insects mutated to giant size creatures and started to attack humans. Cities were destroyed and humans moved into various colonies to survive.Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien) is the good natured but geeky cook living in an underground bunker for the last seven years. Where others have paired up, he his on his own. His parents died when the creatures attacked and he also got separated from his girlfriend Aimee (Jessica Henwick.)When Joel reconnects with Aimee by radio he decides to seek her out but she lives in a seaside community 80 miles away and it is a treacherous journey to get there as the creatures still roam. The problem for Joel is that he freezes in the face of danger and he also seems not to have considered whether pretty Aimee had someone else in the intervening years.The chances are low that Joel will be successful in his quest. The people in his bunker advise against him leaving. On his journey Joel befriends a dog and meets two survivalists Clyde Dutton (Michael Rooker) and a young girl Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt.) Clyde gives Joel some survival tips which gains him some confidence.The movie is a humorous underdog story told with some charm. O'Brien is likeable as the flawed hero. The third act involving an Australian sea captain with plans to rescue Aimee's community was a tacked on misfire.",Love and Monsters
3,nogodnomasters,Fool's Errand,8,1 November 2020,"Bad news: Asteroid Agatha 616 is headed at Earth. Good News: Rockets are deployed to destroy the asteroid and succeed. Bad news: The fallout causes mutation in insects and cold blooded animals. Humans live underground in colonies. Our story focuses on Joel (Dylan O'Brien ) who freezes at the sight of a monster, even after seven years. He has been separated from his only teen love Aimee (Jessica Henwick) who is at another colony 85 dangerous surface miles away. Joel decides he wants to see her and starts out on a trek.The story is mostly comedy. Joel meets Michael Rooker and young Ariana Greenblatt on the surface who are seasoned surface survivors who teach him the ropes.

4,kosmasp,No humans land,9,19 April 2021,"I am not sure if anyone is enjoying my riffs or how much sense some of the funny things I come up with as summary lines are making - or even if some consider them funny at all. Having said all that, the movie is funny. But even that can be judged differently by differnt individuals. The CGI work is really well done and the story is well thought of.Of course every fun moment or any moment in general happening here can be taken and dissected. Even if it has so many wink wink moments - as in knowing what we expect and try to surprise us while also delivering on what we want to see. The story is predictable - but that does not stop this from being really entertaining from start to finish. Great actors round the whole thing up - actaully my first thought concerning a summary line was ""Maze Runner meets Iron Fist"" - ok so it may have been a stretch, especially because there is not really so much hand to hand combat here ... but would be relying more on the actors involved. Enjoyable to say the least! I wouldn't mind a sequel as well.",Love and Monsters
5,paul_haakonsen,What a surprise of a movie...,8,22 October 2020,"Right, well I had virtually no idea what I was getting into when I sat down to watch the 2020 movie ""Monster Problems"" (aka ""Love and Monsters""). But I must admit that I was genuinely interested in the movie given the presentation of the poster.And now that I have seen the movie, I must just say: wow!""Monster Problems"" was definitely a wonderful surprise of an entertaining and enjoyable movie. It turned out to be one of the more memorable and entertaining of movies that I have seen in 2020 - and I watch a lot of movies.The storyline told in ""Monster Problems"" was pretty straight forward, but it was at the same time a very interesting storyline that definitely appealed to me in many ways, especially since I have always enjoyed a good creature feature. And with the sheer size of the creatures in ""Monster Problems"", then I was in for quite the treat.Sure, you can say that the main plot was somewhat sappy and a bit on the simplistic side, perhaps appealing more to a younger romantically hazed audience. But the combination of the sappy romance, mixed with the action, suspense and monstrous creatures actually made for quite an enjoyable cocktail.Visually then I was without a doubt impressed with how ""Monster Problems"" turned out. The creature designs were just spectacular and they looked very realistic in the way they moved, behaved and appeared. So the CGI team definitely delivered some nice eye candy with this movie.The acting in the movie was good, and was definitely impressed with the performance of lead actor Dylan O'Brien. I was not familiar with him, but he was really great in this movie. I think it was a shame that Jessica Henwick and Michael Rooker weren't given more screen time, because they brought a lot of good things to the movie with their performances and their characters. And the dog Dodge (playing Boy), well he was just spectacular, what a well-trained dog, and it had such great on-camera presence.I can warmly recommend that you take the time and effort to sit down and watch ""Monster Problems"", because this movie was great. I was genuinely surprised and entertained with what writers Brian Duffield and Matthew Robinson managed to deliver.My rating of ""Monster Problems"" is a sure eight out of ten stars. This movie deserves a sequel, no question about it.",Love and Monsters
6,BandSAboutMovies,A great movie!,8,5 November 2020,"Of all the films that I've watched over quarantine, Love and Monsters is the one that deserved to play in a theater.Directed by Michael Matthews from a script by Brian Duffield (who wrote The Babysitter and wrote and directed Spontaneous) and Matthew Robinson (Monster Trucks), this movie creates an interesting world from the first frame, a place where an asteroid almost hits the Earth, but nuclear weapons destroy it. However, the fallout transforms any cold-blooded animal into a mutated monster and within days, most of the human race is dead.This all takes place seven years before this movie, on the night that Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien) is separated from his girlfriend Aimee (Jessica Henwick). After reconnecting with her via the radio, he decides to leave behind the bunker where he's spent his life and cross the dangerous world left behind to find her.Joel has no survival skills at all, mostly acting as the cook for his group. Once he gets to the outside, he's quickly saved and taught what he needs to know by Clyde Dutton (Michael Rooker) and Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt). Then, he's on his way, seeking true love, which he learns the meaning of once he gets to Aimee's settlement.If you have older kids who aren't frightened by big monsters, this is a great movie. I'll give you a small spoiler and let you know that Boy the dog survives, if you worry about that like I do.Originally titled Monster Problems, this has moments of true beauty amongst the monster mayhem, such as when the Mav1s robot plays music for our hero and luminescent jellyfish float through the air.I would more than recommend this movie and hope for a sequel. It was an absolute blast and a real escape from the issues of the world, as all good movies are.",Love and Monsters
7,neil-476,Highly enjoyable,9,20 April 2021,"The after-effects of blasting to bits an otherwise Earth-destroying asteroid have, unfortunately, turned creepy-crawlies into giant carniverous monsters, leaving small groups of surviving humans hiding away in fear. Seven years later, scaredycat Joel is the only singleton in his colony, so he decides to defy his group's (accurate) assessment of his cowardice, and go looking for girlfriend Aimee, last seen 7 years ago but known to have survived in a colony some distance away.This is a straightforward monster movie with humour. It's fairly family friendly - no explicit violence to humans, minimal bad language, and a great deal of fun. It's exciting, the monsters are good, and Joel (played well by Dylan O'Brien) is a likeable protagonist.It's not much of a stretch to see the seeds of this film in Zombieland, but it is noticeably gentler. I really liked it.",Love and Monsters
8,bombersflyup,A worthwhile adventure.,8,19 October 2020,"Love and Monsters is a flimsy lighter version of ""The Mist,"" done the right way.Over a longer period and through one perspective. It's well written, with realistic characterization and heart within the CGI surroundings. Well acted as well, Dylan O'Brien worthy of any leading role. Being family friendly perhaps holds it back a little, but the best film I've seen of 2020 thus far.",Love and Monsters
9,trashgang,family movie,7,19 April 2021,"What a surprise to see Dylan O'Brien back. And I must say he did well playing what he does best, being a loser.The title does say what it's all about. Falling in love as an adolescent but then a meteor crashed on earth and hell breaks out. Of course being seperated he goes after 7 years for a search of his love.Doing so monster come across his road. Sometimes funny and sometimes it's messy. Luckily it isn't a flick were all things fall together like a Disney flick.On part of the effects it's a really top notch and the story is okay too and funny in some parts, espescially with the 8 year old girl.It's one to see with the whole familyGore 0/5

10,deloudelouvain,Entertaining with good CGI's.,7,21 November 2020,"I get the high ratings this movie received as it's a well made and it's an entertaining movie. It's a light apocalyptic adventure movie, nothing to take too serious but certainly interesting to watch. The CGI's are well done and are the best part of the movie, it keeps your attention. To me it would have been even better with more different monsters. The plot is simple but effective. The cast is unknown to me but they all did a good job. It's a movie for everybody, that is if you're not too picky when it comes to realistic stories because this is all fantasy and will never happen, at least not in our lifetime. Good movie for this genre.",Love and Monsters
11,siderite,"Zombieland meets Daybreak, but without the comedy",7,5 April 2021,"Nice and inexperienced guy in a world of insectoid monsters decides to go look for his girlfriend who he hasn't seen for seven years. Everybody tells him it's an insane idea, but he does it anyway. And instead of dying in the first 5 minutes and the movie ending, he actually gets to the girl and in the process discovers himself and the strength within. Who would have expected that?It's a typical hero journey, the effects are not overused, but good quality when they are. It doesn't do much in terms of story, just a guy lucky to survive in a world that is not as monstrous as everybody thought. Perhaps if it were more monstrous then the movie would have been rated R or labeled ""horror"" and people like my wife would had automatically dismissed it, so win win, I guess.It's not a great movie, but it's good fun, so if you need something light, give it a try.",Love and Monsters
12,FeastMode,teen romance without intrigue,4,17 May 2021,"This isn't a bad movie, it just didn't do much for me. I barely laughed at any of the comedic parts. The tone was a little too happy. The protagonist was not the awkward but charming character he was trying to be, something justin long does well. And there are a bunch of high school drama cliches that i predicted a mile ahead. The monsters looked cool but were barely on screen. And the action wasn't good enough to add value (1 viewing, 5/16/2021)",Love and Monsters
13,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Now the flies swat us.,7,27 April 2021,"Set in a post-apocalyptic future in which cold-blooded creatures have mutated into giant monsters, 'Love And Monsters (2020)' tells the story of a young, bunker-confined man who decides to face his fears and make an eighty-mile journey across the dangerous surface to find his high-school sweetheart and sweep her off her feet. It's a light-hearted, mostly predictable affair with an affable lead and several enjoyable set-pieces. It's nothing special, per se, but it works well and is undeniably entertaining. It has some solid visual effects (as well as rather strong visual design, in general) and maintains a fairly consistent pacing throughout. It's not really all that deep - although its story does touch on a couple of interesting themes - but it doesn't need to be. It's a fun time. 7/10.",Love and Monsters
14,Cineanalyst,Drawing Out the Apocalypse,7,7 August 2021,"Talk about bad timing, ""Love and Monsters"" was slated for release in April 2020, but then the pandemic struck, and the picture like many people hid in their metaphorical bunkers. At first, the release date was pushed back to 2021, but then again Paramount had the stupid idea to release a movie that's message calls for people to leave their bunkers and breathe in the fresh air despite risk to their lives--released right as the United States and much of the rest of the world was heading into a COVID winter that would see as of then the highest death tolls yet and as even some national leaders in particular weren't taking any of that seriously, making political hay of it, and may've also happened to be up for re-election. I'm happy I waited to see this one, as that message is a bit easier to swallow now (although it remains rather Darwinist regardless). Not because their aren't still mutating monsters out there, whether kaiju insects, amphibians, crustaceans or what have you, or Alpha-to-Delta and so on variants, but because, yeah, most people aren't comfortable remaining in a bunker for years on end, the medicine has arrived, and the characters in ""Love and Monsters"" take precautions--trying to avoid especially dangerous situations, taking their medicine to ward off the poison, and wearing the crossbow or grenade version of personal protective equipment.Studio malpractice aside, there's no way, of course, the filmmakers would've known any of this when they made ""Love and Monsters."" So, it's otherwise merely a silly giant-monsters movie with Oscar-nominated CGI and that's sometimes amusing and follows a standard, sex-driven (he's the only one in his bunker suffering celibacy) quest narrative. It also makes fun of generic apocalyptic asteroid or meteor or comet movies, so take that ""Greenland"" (2020), I guess. And, there's a bit of AI tech in there somewhere, too, for no apparent narrative reason.Some art remains in this apocalyptic wasteland, as our hero also provides its meta-narrative construction. He draws the kaiju and provides captions for them in his book and will later transmit this information via sound recording and radio--much as he does for us, the spectator, with voiceover narration. This is what endears this variation of ""A Boy and His Dog"" (1975) to the proceeding's actually most appealing characters, ""The Walking Dead,"" zombie-apocalypse veteran Michael Rooker's Clyde and his child survivalist associate Minnow. Per usual, they're right. It's all more enjoyable than the stupid ""love"" part of the title.",Love and Monsters
15,cricketbat,More heart than I expected,7,27 April 2021,"Love and Monsters is a strangely lighthearted post-apocalyptic story. And while the premise makes it sound like a low-budget TV movie, I was quite impressed with the visual effects and the overall production quality. Dylan O'Brien is a highly relatable protagonist, and this quirky creature flick had more heart than I expected. I think more people should know about this film.",Love and Monsters
16,A_Different_Drummer,OBRIEN OBRIEN OBRIEN,7,31 December 2020,"These hi-concept voice-over end of the world affairs do not always work, but the script here is smart enough to consistently play to basic human emotions and Obrien seems to have enough charm in the tank to power a battleship.",Love and Monsters
17,westsideschl,Hooks: Guy; Girl; Dog,4,24 February 2021,"Fairly good CGI of monster insects turning the tables on humans to make them the munchies. Not very believable that only insects & invertebrates get to supersize (also not structurally possible per even high school science).
Cause: The usual asteroid episode encounter w/Earth. Teen hook of teen goes on perilous journey (accompanied by dog of course) to see girlfriend. Left open a sequel monster mash. High school drama class level acting & dialogue.

18,The-Sarkologist,A Delightful Adventure,8,30 May 2021,"The thing about this film was that it felt way too polished to be your typical straight to Netflix film, and it turned out that it was never supposed to be a straight to streaming film. Unfortunately, well, a certain world wide pandemic sort of got in the way of this film appearing in the cinemas, and because there really wasn't time to wait, it just ended up being released that way. Mind you, I almost complete wrote it off as being some poor attempt at copying some other film, and I guess I'm glad that I gave it ago because it turned out to be pretty good.Mind you, there was a lot of similarities between this film and Zombie Land, though some people have suggested that this film is a little more family orientated. I guess the similarities lie in that both films are set in a post apocalyptic landscape, and both films are quite light hearted where a rather geeky individual happens to be the leading character.So, we have Joel Dawson, who is the narrator, the hero, and also a bit of a dweeb. Because he isn't all that good at killing monsters, he basically has cooking duties, and is also the unfortunate one that hasn't paired up with the group that he is sheltering with. However, he ends up connecting with his girlfriend from before the disaster so he decides to do a silly thing and make the four day trek across country to find her. As you can probably guess from the title, and the trailer, the world is now full of monsters.I don't consider this to be one of the laugh out loud type of films, not like Zombieland, though it certainly does have it's fair share of quirks. For instance, I really liked the dog, particularly since everybody started referring to it as boy. Actually, the doq was a really cool addition to the film, especially since it was pretty much as quirky as some of the characters. However, as I suggested, it isn't as out there as Zombieland was (like, the whole Bill Murray scene is an example of how Zombieland is pretty crazy).Still, I quite liked the film, especially since as the title suggests, it is also about love, and how love basically makes you do some pretty stupid things, such as traveling across a monster infested wasteland looking for your long lost love, even though your long lost love may not necessarily love you anymore. I guess it is also something about taking some form of responsibility, and how our decisions can define our characters, especially if we do something that is pretty dangerous, such as crossing a monster infested realm. However, as I indicated, this is actually a pretty cool film, and it is certainly one that I would have ended up watching if it was in the cinemas.",Love and Monsters
19,ops-52535,its a jolly good...,7,16 October 2020,"Kind of almost familyfriendly scifi action, postapocalyptic story about the superbugs overtaking planet earth, dividing two lifes appart, leaving them seperated for 7 years, till the hamradio starts queking and our main hears that beloved voice of hers, and then the journey towards love and sunsets by the beach start, having to conquer super maggots, crabs and leaches from fairfield to point reyes, though vaccaville wouldve been easier..its an adventure, its not badly made technically but the story and some of acting are cringeworthy, and the plotspeed slow, but if you can endure one presidents 2 hours massmeetings, than you may be able to stand this out too.its full of colour, visual and sound effects, it has some superman riddles over it but its an okay enough watch to start your weekend with. a 7 from the grumpy old man.",Love and Monsters
20,cruise01,"Great feel good monster post apocalyptic film that delivers action, humor, and a growing up kind of story.",10,23 October 2020,5 out of 5 stars.Love and Monster is a fantasy post apocalyptic adventure film about Joel (Dylan O'Brien) who is surviving with a colony underground from a monster apocalypse. Which the film does give a brief introduction about how the monsters originated and mutated. Without giving away details. His girlfriend Aimee (Jessica Henwick) is in another colony 40 miles away. Which Joel plans to get up from underground to go on a journey to reunite with her. He comes across a dog. And two others Clyde (Michael Rooker) and Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt). Learning survival tips. And how to face his fears.It is an adventure coming of age kind of story. Its a bit fantasy. Action. Sci fi. And a little bit of a love story without getting too sappy into that genre. It is sure as a lot of fun. The script delivered making Joel as a lovable character who is a bit of a runt in his colony. Where he sticks out as the least productive person. While everyone is mastered in surviving and fighting monsters. Seeing him come up from underneath and clueless on where to go is a lot of fun. The direction plays a little like zombieland mixed with a little bit of a road apocalypse film like Mad max but in a family friendly version of it.The film does have some exciting action sequences with them escaping from monsters and fighting back. The visual effects are great. The music score was good. The film does have a climatic battle on the beach with a giant like crab of a monster.Dylan O'Brien did great playing the character. Adding emotional depth to his journey in reuniting with his love. After feeling isolated from losing his family. And being separated from Aimee. Michael Rooker and Ariana Greenblatt did good too. Jessica Henwick was also great playing in a brief role.It is a fun family adventure apocalypse film that delivers heart. Action. Adventure and a bit of humor.,Love and Monsters
21,eddie_baggins,A colourful and fun monster filled adventure,7,25 April 2021,"You would have been hard pressed to find many people early in 2020 saying how much they were looking forward to the sophomore feature from director Michael Matthews Love and Monsters, a mid-budget offering that was filmed in the picturesque surrounds of Australian's sunshine state Queensland, but in a year that has seen many high-profile offerings depart the release schedule in hope of clearer climates of late 2021, this unassuming and fun offering is easily one of the nicest little surprises of the year film wise.Starring one time next big thing Dylan O'Brien, who is still working his way back from a potentially life threatening injury he sustained whilst filming the last Maze Runner film, Monsters is a film that is familiar in many ways but inventive enough to keep things fresh and exciting, as O'Brien's softly spoken Joel sets out to reconnect with the love of his life Aimee in the dangerous surrounds of a threat filled apocalypse where giant snails or flesh hungry frogs await your every move.Always a naturally charismatic and likable on screen presence, O'Brien is perfectly suited to make us care for Joel with his character and the film itself feeling like a family friendly version of hit zombie comedy Zombieland as Joel's neurotic tendencies and awkward nature feeling very Jesse Eisenberg like and the film's voice over filled and colourfully over the top antics not dissimilar to the stylings and energy of the two walking dead filled hits.It's hugely impressive what Matthews manages to do with his creative world off what is no doubt a low-end budget for such a production and he and his creative team work some visual wonders into the final product that moulds together some scenic Australian surrounds with some great CGI/practical effects that are on par with much higher budgeted offerings that could learn a thing or too by Monsters innovative creativity.There's no doubt that Monsters won't leave anything of a lasting nature for viewers to remember too much more of once the credits roll and the films supporting cast that includes the always fun to be around Michael Rooker and rising stars Jessica Henwick and Ariana Greenblatt don't get much to do with limited screen time but that's not enough to stop this colorful adventure from being a fun and enjoyable ride.Final Say -A surprisingly pleasant cinematic treat, Love and Monsters may not appear on paper to be anything special but its creativity, craftsmanship and sense of fun will quickly win you over with hopes this may not be the last time we see Joel, his trusty pooch Boy and fellow offsiders on the big stage.3 1/2 underground cows out of 5.",Love and Monsters

I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I sat down to watch this movie. It turned out to be a lot of fun. Post-apocalyptic comedies are quickly becoming one of my favorite genres. ""Love and Monsters"" fits right in with the best of them. The movie is suspenseful and very funny. It looks great and has very good music. The cast is top-notch with standout performances by Dylan O'Brien and Michael Rooker. This might be Rooker's best work. ""Love and Monsters"" totally hit the spot.

24,arfdawg-1,Mediocre and Inexpensively Made.,2,18 October 2020,It's just not a very good movie. The storyline is boring. You barely see any of the so called monsters.

25,southdavid,Freaks and Geeks,7,27 April 2021,"I'm pleasantly surprised about the films score on IMDB at time of writing, quite a respectable 7.0, as I'd imagine it would be much more divisive than it is. Personally, I thought it was pretty reasonable and though it could easily have settled for being like any of the many big creature movies that populate the SYFY channel during the day, it doesn't, due to the performances and a few more savvy ideas in the story.The fallout from missiles sent to destroy a world ending meteor has mutated the reptiles and insects of Earth to massive sizes, who, in turn, have killed most of the population. Those that have survived live underground in bunkers, one of whom is Joel (Dylan O'Brien) whose paralysing fears make him unsuitable for raiding/hunting parties. He has other skills make him a valued member of his community, but the lack of romantic options leads him to decide to trek across 85 miles of the surface to the bunker where his former girlfriend lives.There is lots to admire about the film. The effects are really good, both the up-close views of the creatures we see and also the wide shots, that show long term damage of the war between the humans and the goliaths. Indeed, the film was Oscar nominated for its visual effects this year. The performances are pretty solid too, some of the characters are a little cliché but the casting, for example, with Michael Rooker and Arian Greenblatt as a de facto father and daughter, who live on the surface is excellent. The story has some novel twists that you might not otherwise have expected. A lesser story would have painted Joel as more of a loser and made his bunker eager to see the back of him, the relationship between Joel and Aimee - played by Jessica Henwick - might have turned out differently or the temptation to have Rooker return might have been succumbed too.It's good, but not great though, for me. It does drift a bit, in the middle, including a weird detour for a spell at the motel and though I liked the resolution, it does feel a bit tacked on, to provide some closure for Joel. That said, it was entertaining enough to keep me engaged and off my phone for its run time.",Love and Monsters

27,Vartiainen,Playful survival adventure,6,5 September 2021,"So the apocalypse has come and most of humanity is dead. It happens. The survivors are hiding in bunkers underground. One of them happens to be Joel (Dylan O'Brien), who was separated from his girlfriend when the mutated monsters attacked. Now he's finally had enough and sets out to reach her bunker, despite the monsters still very much roaming the earth.Love and Monsters is basically Zombieland if it took itself a tad more seriously. It's still somewhat goofy in tone, but not so much that you'd classify it as comedy. It's close, though.I also like how it has a clear identity. The VFX utilized for the monsters are topnotch and the designs for them are very imaginative. You can clearly see which animal any given monster was before mutating, but at the same time they're their own unique creations. Visually a very memorable film overall.The story is also nicely self-contained and interesting. This film could easily have a sequel, but it doesn't bait you with one.All that being said, I did find the characters to be a bit dull. O'Brien has that next door neighbour vibe to him, which makes him forgettable as an actor. Which is not a great quality for the lead. Likewise all the other actors were perfectly serviceable, but none of them really stood out. Well, perhaps Michael Rooker and Ariana Greenblatt as a pair of survivors Joel meets on his journey, but then again they were written to have an impact.Love and Monsters is a fine film to watch if you're looking for something adventurous with just the little bit of an edge. It's also a very good film if you're looking for cool VFXs.",Love and Monsters

But the humor never goes to deep in like parody mode. Dylan O' Brien is amusing and quite humorous has Joel, kind of spoofing his Maze Runner character. Jessica Henwick is also good.

29,kevin_robbins,I'd strongly recommend seeing this as the production value is very good,8,21 May 2021,"Love and Monsters (2020) is a movie my daughter and I recently watched together on our flight to Florida (it was playing on the plane). The storyline takes place in a world that has been taken over by monsters and pockets of survivors exist. Everyone has a role within each group of survivors. The cook at one camp discovers his girlfriend from when the world was normal is still alive and sets out in a adventure to join her against the advice of group. Can he make it across the land of monsters to his girlfriend? This movie is directed by Michael Matthews (Five Fingers for Marseilles) and stars Dylan OBrien (Teen Wolf), Michael Rooker (Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer), Jessica Henwick (Game of Thrones) and Dan Ewing (Chasing Coments). This storyline was pretty entertaining and did a great job of not taking itself too seriously. The script is very well written and there's some great lines and conversations. Michael Rooker and the little girl were easily my favorite two characters. The monsters were very well done and I enjoyed the special effects. The ending was also realistic instead of the natural happy ending. Loved the setup for more films, which my daughter and I will surely catch. Overall I'd strongly recommend seeing this as the production value is very good. I'd score this a solid 7.5/10.",Love and Monsters

31,alindsay-al,A Surprisingly Fun Film,7,15 April 2021,"After a much delayed release the film Love and Monsters made its way to Netflix yesterday and I watched it today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young man in the apocalypse as he tries to travel for 7 days to find his Girlfriend, in a world that has become infested with monsters.Main Character
Dylan O'Brien plays the lead here and he does a really good job. He is just such a likeable character and one that is easy to root for, it makes the audience really want to see him succeed in his quest. He is funny and charming and just a really good lead character for this film.Supporting Characters
Jessica Henwick plays his girlfriend and when she is on screen she gives a good performance. Obviously, due to the narrative we don't spend too much time with her but when we do you really see the chemistry that her and O'Brien have and it raises up this pretty simple quest for love story. Michael Rooker is here as a survivor and he is great, he is just the perfect person to play his role and the scenes with him are some of the best of the film, it's just a bit of shame they didn't do more with him and Ariana Greenblatt's characters as they were highlights of the film for sure. I mean there is even a cool dog called Boy that joins them on their journey and plenty of time is given to show the bond between him and O'Brien and it is done really well.Story
The story is interesting, I like the lore and backstory as to how the world went to hell and led to monsters being everywhere. There is also no denying that it is fun seeing O'Brien having to travel outside for the first time where he is pretty useless at just about everything. But, I would say this works for the first two acts and then falls flat in its last act. It's like the writers wrote the film chronologically and weren't exactly sure how the film should end so they ended up with this strange last act of the film that doesn't quite mesh with the other elements put on screen.Script
The script is actually pretty good, this film is pretty funny and had me laughing quite a lot which considering it isn't a straight up comedy deserves some big credit. Also the film has some nice amount of heart, not all of it works but it is handled well enough. But as I said above I just can't get over the writing for the last act and how it feels very different to the other parts of the film and not in a particularly positive way.Style
The style of the film looks great, the visuals are really good with the world being shown to be very luscious and beautiful despite all the bad that has happened. Also the creature designs all hold up and the CGI for them is all of a good quality. But the pacing for the film at times is a little off and yes I am mostly talking about the last 20/30 mins. Which makes the film drag and maybe something more creative and keeping with the first two acts would have been better received by me.Overall
Overall, Love and Monsters was a big surprise for me and I ended up thinking that this is a good film. If you have 2 hours then I would say give this film a chance and with a pretty open ended ending there is chance for a new franchise to be made here.",Love and Monsters
32,henry8-3,Love and Monsters,6,26 April 2021,"On a post apocalyptic world now crawling with giant and venomous insects, O'Brien lives underground with a group of survivors. He is though a complete coward and incapable of contributing much - he looks after the cow and makes soup. He decided to leave the camp and make for another across deadly open land where his girlfriend from 7 years before is based.A strange film this as it taps into a sort of Spielbergian boys own adventure not seen for some time. O'Brien is fairly good company, the comedy light but amusing, the creature effects are not a sensation, but good enough and the plot follows a predictable but jolly line as he heads across land to try to find his girl. It all gets a bit neat and Disneyesque tying everything up nicely at the end, but overall a fun romp. Nice dog!",Love and Monsters

The storyline was so so unique which was refreshing, and the graphics were phenomenal.I feel like anyone can enjoy this, whatever their preferred genre is... There were moments of tension and a few jumpscares for the horror fans; giant bugs and lizards for the sci-fi fans; humour for the comedy fans; and the entire basis for the movie is about Joel travelling through what can only be described as Hell on Earth to find his love for the romance fans... ALL whilst being suitable to watch with the family (in my opinion, though some may argue it is not child-friendly).",Love and Monsters

This movie nails it and I mean on every aspect, acting, story, effects, direction, cinematography, and of course a great ending!!

A sequel is definitely in order here not sure if this will be another casualty of this virus .I hope not cause its exactly what we need right now....HOPE!!!!!!!

37,Pairic,Great Post-Apocalypse Pastiche,8,16 April 2021,"Love and Monsters: A comedy but also a pastiche of the Post-Apocalypse movie genre. Killer asteroid, broken into bits by missiles but chemicals from missiles come back into atmosphere. Insects and cold-blood animals mutate into monsters. People get literally eaten alive by a swarm of termites. Anyway 95% of the human population is killed off. Joel was 17 on Doomsday and was separated from his girlfriend Aimee, 7 years later he's in a bunker the only single among couples but he has contacted Aimee over a radio. A giant ant attacks the bunker and though only one occupant is devoured Joel heads off overland to find his girlfriend. He really isn't survivor material but meets up with a friendly dog who saves him from a Toad Monster. Later he teams up with Clyde, a survivalist and a young girl, Minnow, an ace shot with a crossbow. A quest film with flashbacks to how the Apocalypse unfolded. Some great monsters, the toad, a boulder snail, a giant crab among others. Homage is paid to film and TV portrays of such creatures, in particular a scene of fighting the crab reminds me of Journey To The Centre Of The Earth (1959). An enjoyable romp.

Summary:Trying to be concise on this review, the movie surprisingly opens up well given all the bases it is trying to cover. A humorous cartoon drawing showing the world going to pot, the new Armageddon takes little time to get things going and drop you into the world of despair and big creatures. This pace continues, with little hesitation as Joel and his furry buddy go from point to point in their quest to find love and survive the horrors of the new world. Those horrors are really cool too see, mutated insects and amphibians with a true macabre design that has hints of human qualities, hybridization of other creatures, and the natural instincts of the creatures themselves. It works, and paints a horrifying set of monsters that if they existed would mean much trouble for the human race. The CGI to paint these creatures, and the world itself, is impressive for this movie, bringing the post-apocalyptic world to new realms of high definition details of despair.
Now amidst impressive CGI work that will snare you into its trap, the movie also brings about some other gimmicks to help cast that net wider and catch more groups. The writing is quirky, a combination of a self-depreciating monologue, some insult humor, and slapstick/fall down comedy that all mingles well. Other styles get thrown in here or there to help liven things up and it tries to keep the mood of the film as high as it can be given the material. Yet, there are emotional moments that will help bring most back into the film, in an attempt to bring you closer to the characters, or help gain some suspense in hopes you won't see your favorite character reduced to bloody remains. Add some music to help add edges to further liven things up, again a nice selection of components to help round out the movie. Though the part that kept me pulled into the movie the most was the dog. Yes, another display of impressive animal training, the dog kept me into the movie, with most of the suspense coming in the form of will the dog survive. I can't tell you the answer, but I loved the cute puppy in every shot and I think many will as well.Then comes the dislikes section of this predictable tale, the usual manners of a cool concept being pulled into a short time span resulting in some limited portrayals. For one thing the action scenes are rather boring, again most of the suspense geared towards the dog, as intense bouts of running from artificial creatures with loud sounds filled much of the film. Even those with combat scenes are rather limited, only a step above the SyFy channel original movies in terms of plot, build up and excitement. Thus, the action part needs a tune up for this reviewer, injecting close calls, good character involvement, and some major upgrades in suspense. . But you may not care about the action, you are drama lover who wants good characters well again those moments are kind of strewn. Joel's story is well done, but many of the other characters, as well as the relationships between them, is not as well developed as it could be. The compressed time frame has much to blame for this, as well as a potential budget for creature development, but I was rather bored with the rest of the characters. Sure some words of wisdom were shared, a few moments of hugging, and a few orchestra laden realizations have their moments. Yet, the rest is sort of background noise, who after their gimmicks are lost to the background for most of the movie. Given the casting they pulled in, I had hoped for more to help tell this tale. Again this is due to time, but perhaps planning this out, and not having a pandemic as well, could have helped strengthen the resolve.The VERDICT:Love and Monster is trying to impress a wide variety of people with their writing and CGI involvement and the promise of emotional, young love. On parts they succeed given all the circumstances with a well-designed world, gorgeous and creative creatures, and some well-timed comedy. Yet for the other parts, they manage to scratch the surface, promising more than they deliver in the run time provided to them. Love and Monsters almost needed a plan, and the money to support it, to make a planned series where emotional build up could have had time and we could have gotten more investment with our characters. This film almost felt like a good TV pilot or mini-series, and had they done that approach , many of the limitations would have greatly improved. Still, the movie breaks the mediocre movies I've seen at home, and I would give it a shot if you find the time for it. Otherwise, pray that blockbusters return to the theaters soon to help break the mundane films we've been getting.My scores are:Adventure/Comedy: 7.5

44,mhorg2018,As Bad as a Quiet Place,1,26 April 2021,"This might have worked as a short. As a full movie - it's as dumb as A Quiet Place. Just a really silly movie, with such a contrived story, as to be ridiculous. The best characters are Michael Rooker - who, playing a character he's played before, isn't stretched, and the kid whose with him. What happened to the dog? He just disappears without a note to it. The monsters are fairly generic, looking like they were lifted from anime. The whole oh my girlfriend is living 85 miles away! Was silly.

The movie feels very refreshing in its subject matter and execution. It's got charm, style and a charasmatic, engaging leading man.

50,Prashast_Singh,An action-adventure released at the right time.,10,19 April 2021,"This is easily one of the most apt films to watch these days. Although Love and Monsters is set in a post-apocalyptic world, relating to it and the characters' emotions becomes much easier given the ongoing global crisis. And that is why I believe this is just the right time to watch it, along with some beverages and a tub of popcorn.Dylan O'Brien: what a talented actor he is! He might not have the looks of a battle-hardened action hero but surely captures the heart of one with his fantastic performance and dialogue delivery. His expressions in a scene where he hides from a particular monster were just so spot-on that I forgot I was watching a movie! Jessica Henwick, Ariana Greenblatt and Michael Rooker have comparatively shorter screen presence than O'Brien, but are impressive whenever seen.The film is an exciting action-adventure with lots of heart and humor to make it a fun watch with the family, despite the PG-13 rating due to its violent action and occasional but not excessive profanity. The special effects, for which it has even earned an Oscar nomination, are splendid and feel nothing like computer generated, to start with. That's some fantastic work for a film like this. The action sequences are a big draw, and are executed with finesse. The story has a lot of important life lessons to offer, and while the humor is served in plenty, the drama is also present in just a good amount to balance the overall tone.Love and Monsters ends up feeling pretty realistic due to the human themes resonating and moving viewers from time to time. It's overall a pretty inspiring story of a man on a mission. I could identify with the protagonist Joel and wondered if I too could go that far for a loved one in reality, but the film answered that and many other questions so well that I don't even have to doubt I would. This was a really fun film, and by the time the credits started rolling, I was already wanting a sequel. If that alone doesn't prove how much I liked it, I don't know what else would.",Love and Monsters

58,kjproulx,An Absolute Joy to Watch,8,18 October 2020,"Films like this are very rare these days. The number of times a studio greenlights an original idea that has the feel of something that would've been in theatres over a decade or two ago is slim to none. Love and Monsters, although meant for the big screen, has just become available to watch at home and I feel that this gem of an adventure will go way under the radar. With a fun concept from start to finish and a real emotional core throughout, I had an absolute blast watching this film. Here's why Love and Monsters deserves your time.After attempting to save the planet, the human race accidentally created an apocalypse. Many years later, separated from his girlfriend, family, and now surviving with a group of warriors, Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien) ventures out to find the love of his life. With the world now infested with giant, mutated insects, the journey will not be easy. The premise itself feels almost too familiar to fully enjoy, but the visuals make it feel unique and the fun tone and uplifting performance by O'Brien made it all worth it. I've also been a fan of his performances for some time now, so I may be a little biased in that regard.Love and Monsters takes the concept of characters being dropped into the apocalypse and spins it on its head. Just when you think it's about to get predictable, it pulls a little fast one and keeps you on your feet. Sure, some of the voiceovers can be a bit much and even a little distracting, but again, Dylan O'Brien is just a very likable actor and he sells pretty much any material he's ever given. At its core, this is a family adventure film, but it's also PG-13, so there is an emotional depth that gives it a layer I wasn't expecting. Yes, it's a little too tame sometimes, but I felt that gave it more charm.More than anything, I'm impressed that director Michael Matthews hadn't worked on anything of this scale before. His work here is miles ahead of many Hollywood directors coming out of the indie realm and I really hope he continues to get more work. It would be unfair if the improbable box office for this movie hurts his future chances. It's not that I absolutely loved this film or anything, but Matthews' touch was very apparent and the movie felt like it had a personality. That's something most Hollywood movies lack these days.In the end, as I said, this isn't anywhere near a perfect film, but it's the most fun I've had watching a new release in many months. If you're looking for something to immerse yourself in a world that's both unique and entertaining, Love and Monsters could very well be the film you need right now. I was invested in the character of Joel Dawson from beginning to end and the emotional core of the movie really worked for me. I watched this film with a giant grin on my face and right now, that's really all I can ask for, especially when the movie itself is well-made. Though it has faults throughout, I absolutely recommend checking out Love and Monsters, now available to stream on some services.",Love and Monsters
59,Neptune165,He killed a giant centipede with two sticks?!!,4,5 February 2021,"This movie was so kiddish I couldn't enjoy it. A horror movie with this exact same premise would be dope. Predictable dialog and plot. Banal at best. yet somehow still surviving"" formula. I am just through with all these plot lines where the characters make bold decisions based upon the shallowest stupid reasons. No guy without any skill set nor knowledge is going to survive all these predators in this horrible world...time and again. By the end of the movie he acts like he's an ultimate survivor but really the whole movie was convenient for him. Found a dog who's really smart except when it comes to red dress. The dog manages to save him from a frog monster. Of course the frog doesn't attack the dog. He falls into a hole with bugs that would kill him but of course he gets help from strangers who conveniently is in the neighborhood. They give him a grenade in which he conveniently uses to kill a monster who jumps in right in the exact moment the bomb explodes. He finally makes it to his girlfriend who conveniently finds him in a forest. But she doesn't like him anymore because it's been so long until he defeats a crab who chooses to be nice to them after he frees him from electric shocks that control the crab. The dog conveniently jumps in the action too after being separated from Dylan. He manages to go to the girl to save her life after Dylan tells him to even tho the dog never met the girl.

63,SoumikBanerjee25,"Barring Joel, Other Characters Had Little to Nothing Attention!",6,27 May 2021,"""Love & Monsters""; can only be considered as a viable post-apocalyptic feature. Not anything 'Groundbreaking' per se. However; A handful of Frightful Monsters, Likeable Leads, and a slew of Moral Lessons more or less makes it a passable endeavor! Nonetheless, one could still argue about its unscathed potential that's been greatly disregarded!Barring its Emotion heavy essence; the primary issue lies deep within its underlying structure; the very foundation of Script Concatenation. Successional events that materialize, they feel disjointed and loosely knit!We jump from Point A to Point B then subsequently to Point C in a rather tumultuous fashion!Camera Work, CGI, Set Design do deserve a round of applause though; but the same cannot be said about its erratic & incoherent Screenplay. Which oftentimes decides to come to a halt for no apparent reason!Performances are decent and at the same time pretty effective; Therefore, I do not have any problems with the ensemble whatsoever. That being said, I still got another major complaint over its slipshod writing in regards to such diverse group of characters.Let us take the example of 'Aimee'; Joel's romantic interest! What should we exactly feel about her? I mean yes, we sure empathize with Joel and his personal 'Motivation' for setting out on a perilous journey against the odds and in the midst of all those deadly critters. But does that particular relationship merit any consideration? The way I see it, shaping Aimee's personality in such divisive way made things even worse!And don't get me started with those so-called bad guys and other supporting characters. It was a lost cause, because no matter how pivotal you initially thought them to be; the writers had other ideas! As you could clearly see most of their roles were short lived and left to fend for themselves!In plain language, they faced premeditated ignorance & repugnance from the makers themselves. That's a Shame!",Love and Monsters
64,0w0,Surprisingly not that bad...,7,21 October 2020,"I thought that this was going to be just another awful 'monsters movie' like 'Monster Trucks (2016)' or 'Ghostbusters (2016)', but I was actually pleasantly surprised when it wasn't terrible in the end... sure, it's not a 8/10 or higher movie, but do I regret watching it? No, not at all. Would I watch it again? No, most likely not... but it's a perfectly fine way to spend 100minutes of your time... I would have liked to have seen more monsters and more action scenes, but I totally understand that that would have driven the $30million budget even higher and would have resulted in an only mildly improved film (could possibly have been an 8/10 film then, but no higher)... But overall it's a perfectly fine monster movie and can be enjoyed by the entire family. Would recommend watching once.",Love and Monsters

Terrible plot, i mean, who really wants to see a guy kept on the floor by a bunch of slim plastic pipes. There's also a female medical doctor show with weak needs. They show her after work in the pool burping",Love and Monsters
66,CANpatbuck3664,"Hilarious and Unexpectedly Poignant, Love and Monsters was a Huge Surprise For Me",9,25 January 2021,"In this version of Earth, everyday animals have mutated into giant beasts. Monsters have been done time and time again so poor design or bad CGI could have easily tripped up Love and Monsters but I think the creature work is solid and the action with them is capably done. None of the effects ever seemed shoddy or below par and despite the environment being very much your average post-apocalypse dystopia, these designs added some flavour and the action suitably raised the stakes and got you to care for our main character Joel.Speaking of our protagonist, in the lead, we have Dylan O'Brien who's most remembered work is his inclusion in the Maze Runner trilogy. He's always been likeable, I never though he'd be the next big thing but he gets the job done in whatever he's in. This was something completely different, he showcases some great comedic timing and his performance wasn't just workmanlike, it was pitch perfect. He still looks enough like a normal guy that you can appreciate him being a wimp and parodying the action star persona. He's the only person on screen a lot of the time but the movie does feature solid work from Michael Rooker, Jessica Henwick and Ariana Greenblatt. They all have funny moments and add to Joel's journey whether he's fighting a giant frog or reconnecting with his long lost girlfriend.The main attraction for me in this movie was the finely tuned comedic narration coming from Joel and the jokes that pepper the movie throughout. Joel is aware of how pathetic he is and despite him being a hopeless romantic, he otherwise has a good grasp on the situation. He pokes fun at himself and how bleak things are continuously but these self-depreciating moments help humanize him. Joel is that secretly snarky friend we all have who has some wise crack to cover up his own inadequacy even though its obvious how helpless he really is. I was cackling throughout Love and Monsters and I have to congratulate the writers for doing such a stand-up job.I don't have a lot of notes for Love and Monsters or much to complain about. I don't like to nitpick but I make an effort to take the bad with the good, even with movies I adore. While the ending is still satisfying and has enough of a punch to justify the time you've invested, there are moments where it borders on being corny or too conventional. The rest of the movie has such a wild creative spark (I echo the comparisons that critics made to Zombieland) and while I was hoping it would keep it up, I can forgive a couple of off notes when the rest feels like a finely constructed symphony.When Love and Monsters wrapped up, I realized that I didn't just like it, I loved it. I haven't laughed this much or this hard in a movie for at least a couple of years, I thought it was an adaptation of a book instead of an original script. If it were a YA adaptation, it would have been the best one I've seen since Harry Potter franchise. But other than the ending being really good instead of great, every part of Love and Monsters is fun, charming and fantastic overall. I wholeheartedly recommend Love and Monsters, its surprisingly family friendly for a post apocalyptic adventure and other than little kids (who may be scared), I think everyone else at least has the potential to get something out of it. If there's a possibility for a sequel (on a side note, who knows about profitability anymore? With how the theatre distribution model has been affected is any movie making money?) I would love to see it. If you get a chance, check this movie out!",Love and Monsters

68,ronakkotian,A fun and relaxing watch,6,10 May 2021,"I didn't expect much going into this film. It seemed like a generic and cheesy film, which at times it was, but there is a surprising amount of fun to be had with Love and Monsters.Love and Monsters follows Joel Dawson, a man living in a monster apocalypse, who leaves his underground bunker to reunite with the girl he loves.The film has a great premise and I liked the overall self-aware tone the film had going for it. It went for a Zombieland type of humour which did create some funny moments even though there were times where the jokes weren't all that funny. There is a great sense of adventure with this film and the different people and creatures Joel encounters over his journey was fun and added to his eventual arc by the end. The CGI for the monsters themselves was actually very good. The design of the monsters were interesting and director Michael Matthews did a good job building tension during those scenes with the monsters. The third act does get messy. There had to something to make the finale exciting and complete Joel's character arc and the film introduces a few villainous characters that I found very underdeveloped and quickly thrown together. For a film that has a great idea for its world like this, I just wish there was more Love and Monsters did with its concept. It had neat ideas for its apocalyptic world but I wish it expanded on those ideas further.The performances are great. Dylan O'Brien suits the role very well and does a pretty good job with it. He's made to seem like a very likeable person and you want to root for him during his quest. Michael Rooker and Ariana Greenblatt were great and fun to watch. Jessica Henwick was also good.Love and Monsters is not an exceptional film but it's a fun and relaxing way to spend 1 hour 40 minutes.",Love and Monsters
69,Stanlee107,Adventure time,6,27 October 2020,This is a family film with the occasional cursing. It is like Jurassic Park but not quite as good.

71,johannes2000-1,"A bit one-dimensional, but otherwise entertaining and fun.",7,22 April 2021,"There is much to like in this movie: the premise is original, there's lots of action with spectacular and creative monsters thanks to top notch CGI, and there is of course Dylan O'Brien, more or less reprising his Teen Wolf characterization of an endearing, clumsy hero-in-spite-of himself. O'Brien keeps amazing me with the different personalities that he very convincingly can produce, like in American Assassin or in the episode of Amazing Stories, where I almost had to look twice to even recognize the Stiles Stilinski that I've come to love.On the other hand, the story that was made out of the premise is pretty one-dimensional: for three-quarter of the movie we just watch O'Brien running through meadows, swamps and forests, avoiding or fighting all kind of monsters. It's only when he reaches the other colony, that something of a real intrigue evolves. And I didn't care much for the voice-over, it's functional in the first 10 minutes to explain how we got to where the movie starts from, but during the rest of the movie I found it mostly annoying, thanks to all the wise-cracking and supposed jokes. Unnecessary, since the movie and O'Brien in itself were funny enough.I would say: not really leaving any lasting impression, but great entertainment for a rainy afternoon.",Love and Monsters
72,trinaboice,"Perfect blend of humor, action, and the feels",10,26 October 2020,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Directed by Michael Matthews, this fun comedy Paramount Pictures is a non-stop adventure that is actually playing in theaters now, as well as on Amazon. It's super funny and family-friendly for all ages. Surprisingly, 2020 has given us several new movies for the Halloween season, but this one is the best by far, in my opinion. It's not really a Halloween movie, but there are some monsters.I was thoroughly entertained by this hero's journey movie. Plus, it offers tips that might actually be helpful if things continue to go wrong in 2021. ha ha
I know a movie is good when I can't wait to watch it again and that's how I felt after watching this movie!TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Lots of kissing and couples cuddling.
Some profanity, sometimes by a little girl.
People in perilous situations.
There are lots of dangerous creatures, but young kids probably won't be too scared. They're mostly giant, mutated insects.
Some violence.
People get drunk.THEMES:
Couples, relationships, love
Courage
Friendship, unity

ApocalypseTHINGS I LIKED:
Dylan O'Brien does a great job as the protagonist in the story who is a ""noble warrior floating on the wings of love"" as Michael Rooker's character describes him. He has perfect comedic timing, can do action, and brings on the feels. He's charming and inspiring and extremely effective in this role. Throw in a dog for his companion and you really want to root for him. There is satisfying character growth. He got his start in Teen Wolf but I didn't see him until The Internship and then his breakaway role in The Maze Runner.
The exposition at the beginning of the movie is pithy and helpful to understand the conditions of the new, dystopian world. There's a lot of exposition, but it didn't bother me too much since we need the information to better understand certain scenes.
You get to see a lot of fun and creative monsters.
The protagonist/narrator says a lot of amusing things.
The conversation with Mav1s was entertaining and touching. Melanie Zanetti voiced Mav1s and Kala. Cool magical sky jellies.
If you love Guardians of the Galaxy (Theatrical) as I do, you'll get a kick out of seeing Michael Rooker, who played Yondu. He's perfect in his role and is so likeable.
Ariana Greenblatt was pretty doggone adorable.
Great musical score by Marco Beltrami and Marcus Trumpp.
There is a little bit of back and forth in time, but viewers won't be confused.
I laughed at Joel's reaction when he first saw the Australian stud-muffin.
Some beautiful cinematography by Lachlan Milne.
The adventure is non-stop and super entertaining.
Great CGI and practical effects.
For a minute or so, I thought one of the Hemsworth brothers was in the movie. ha haTHINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
There was a part of the story that was completely left as a missed opportunity. The dog named ""Boy"" always held on to a red dress. I thought for sure Joel would find the owner of the dress and that she would be his true love, like Tom Hanks in the movie Cast Away That would have been sweet, right? Instead, we never learn anything about the owner of that red dress, so it's just assumed she was eaten by monsters.
There are some missing details, but none of them are super important.You can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",Love and Monsters
73,sbweightman,A fun adventure through an insect filled apocalypse,8,25 April 2021,"A light hearted take on the apocalypse with giant insects where a loveable loser goes on a journey for love. Quirky and silly with a few weird moments but it's mostly run of the mill with its plot and characters. Good special effects and acting, the emotional scenes make it drag a bit in the middle and the ending feels a bit rushed, but other than that, it's good harmless fun.",Love and Monsters
74,PyroSikTh,There's More to Love Than Just Romance,7,15 April 2021,"In the world of Love and Monsters the apocalypse has come. A massive asteroid was set for a collision course with Earth, but thankfully we had the foresight to deal with it before it got too close. What we didn't foresee was the radiation from sending so many nukes into space, and so it rained back down on us and started mutating the more insignificant creatures amongst us. Ants became top predators, Spiders and Crabs became towering behemoths, Frogs filled up entire swimming pools, and Leeches started burrowing underground. Humanity was no longer at the top of the food chain, and was forced to retreat into underground colonies. Enter Joel who has a problem with freezing in fear in near-death situations, relegating him as resident chef of his colony, and more to the point, the only single person. Thankfully for him his girlfriend from before is still alive in another colony across the country, so Joel decides to cross the hellscape above to get back to her. Except what he finds on the surface isn't a hellscape at all, but a thriving ecosystem full of loveable characters.As the title suggests, Love and Monsters isn't just about the post-apocalyptic world jam-packed full of monsters. It's also about love. Being aimed at a somewhat younger audience, Love and Monsters obviously makes the primary focus of Joel's quest to get back to his girlfriend, but in doing so he finds other forms of love. His first friend is a dog called Boy, who is the goodest boy of good boys. Boy loves his owner so much that he carries her dress around with everywhere, even though she's long gone. Then they bump into Clyde and Minnow, a father/daughter pair who found companionship in each other when their loved ones died. And then Joel stumbles across the last MAV1S robot still with charge in, who comforts him with images of his mother and some music. When he finally reaches Aimee, he finds that the love he seeks is nowhere to be found. It's been seven years and she's a different person, who's had her own loves and losses. When reflecting on what to do form this point he discovers all the notes of endearment his old colony gave him to say goodbye, and realises that he had love and a family all along, back where he started.Love and Monsters is unlike most post-apocalyptic movies, ditching the brown and grey bleakness for vibrant colours and vistas, giving us random encounters full of helpful and generous characters instead of the dregs of humanity, and giving us a message about love and break-ups that is far more wholesome than young adult romance stories would otherwise portray them as. This isn't a movie about the downfall of humanity, but about the persevering humanity against it all, about rebuilding society through kindness and generosity. Unlike most post-apocalyptic movies, Love and Monsters is packed full of positive emotions. There are human antagonists in this film too, but they highlight an interesting dichotomy between the humans and monsters, that neither are inherently good or evil, but a little bit of both.The visual effects in this movie are surprisingly good. The monster designs are imaginative and yet somewhat rooted in reality. Most of the truly huge monsters have already died out due to their unsustainable size, while the smaller ones have adapted to their environments. Mutated frogs have evolved little eyestalks to conceal their positions, mutated snails have taken up lodgings in hollowed-out boulders instead of shells, burrowing leeches have created traps for their prey, siren centipedes have found new ways to lure their prey by emitting a high-pitched sound while they wait just under the surface. But the way these creatures are rendered is also incredibly detailed. Every single one is packed full of intricate patterns and textures, from the multiple lines of different sized teeth in the mouths of the leeches, to the barnacles and sad-looking eyes of huge crabs. The way they're blended into their environment, which is usually bright and sunny to boot, is almost flawless, ensuring they have weight in the scene and feel real enough to reach out and touch them.Acting isn't too bad either, with Dylan O'Brien giving us a serviceable fearful nerd turned secret badass trope in a way that doesn't entirely feel as tropey. He's still a reasonably interesting character with motivations and tragedies. Jessica Henwick is also pretty good as Aimee, and they put her martial arts training to good use too. Then there's Michael Rooker as Clyde and Ariana Greenblatt as Minnow who both seem to have a lot of fun as their characters, and steal every scene they're in. I'd love to see a spin-off or sequel focussing on these two and their father/daughter relationship. But honestly the absolute stars of the show are Hero and Dodge, the two dogs that played Boy. I have honestly never seen a canine character so well fleshed-out with his own personality. Their trainers clearly put so much work into them to ensure Boy came out bursting with emotions and character. Every glance at Joel is so intrinsically communicative that you can read his mind and tell what he's feeling. And that adorable unsureness about who to follow when Joel separates from Clyde and Minnow is so heartbreakingly perfect.Love and Monsters probably isn't going to win any awards, but goddamn does it exceed expectations. The story has it's cliché moments, but tries to avoid them as much as possible, and instead of giving us a bleak outlook on the apocalypse, it gives us one full of love, hope, and wholesomeness. This is a great feelgood movie that finds its good feels from unorthodox sources. Right from the opening sketchbook animation and quirky, matter-of-fact monologue to Joel's final words about leaving the dims of the underground and finding life anew on the surface is a breath of fresh air as we reach the end of our own bleak apocalypse. I give Love and Monsters a genuinely enjoyable 7/10, pushing so close to an 8 it may well get promoted as time goes on and looks favourably on it. Go watch Love and Monsters.",Love and Monsters

The movie Is dumb, It has no realism or sense of excitment or urgency. Action scenes are as all the rest. 'Childish, bad acting, boring to watch, empty and hollow In its way to tell a story. We have these huge bugs that dies with sn arrogant to the head or a bullet. In real life bugs still live after heads gets chopped off. Its so common In todays monster movies that all it takes is one arrow. The movie is not funny or comedic either, the childish love obsession story Is just so badly written. You dont care about If they live or die. So the movie fails with the funny part, snd the drama part? The monsters then? Is it worth your time? No.They could have had these huge bugs and made them way scarier and relentless. A much darker movie like the road, then having these mutant bugs as something to truly fear. The concept of such monster movie Is great. Instead we get to watch this cartoonish Cgi movie where centipedes die just breathing on them. I would give love and monsters a zero If it was possible. Because I turned it off towards the ending, I think. I dont care. Completely Lost interest. Why Is it so hard to make monster movies like they did In the 80s? Are directors that lazy today.

I'm assuming that development happened off screen.However, at the same time, considering how much the piece of clothing meant to him (it's his last way of staying connected with his previous owner), I wish he'd still had it - as reassurance...Basically, we needed more dog.

80,DeBBss,A pretty decent film,6,19 April 2021,"Love and Monsters is an above average movie in my opinion. I really liked the plot, even though it had some minor issues. The monsters in Love and Monsters were very well done. The CGI was good enough to make these creatures look realistic. The monster designs were also very good and creative. The film is also very vibrant; it pops with saturated colors, and some scene were just plain beautiful, like the jelly fish scene. What holds the film back were the cliched characters, the comedy, and the screenplay.Joel isn't a very interesting character. He's supposed to be this quirky, awkward kid, but the character became one-dimensional because he never seemed to do anything else but crack unfunny jokes.I've already said I liked the plot, but I didn't like the screenplay. The script could've done a better job at developing the supporting characters and making a more emotional plot. Overall, it's not a bad film.

Well I guess its ocmic book mutant rulebook day, where only so many transform or survive or didnt get eaten by the other ""monsters"".Things couldnt get worse forthe dwindling number of people remaining, except that out of everyone to survive, the story focuses on one of the biggest losers to somehow escape certain death. Wtf first of all. This guy is timid, unsure of himself, beyond beta male, not too bright, lacking common sense or any survival instinct. And the movie goes ON with his pathetic self, trying to get to the one that got away in the dumbest stereotypical fashion movies can do: by crossing miles of giant insect infested lands. Sure. There were almost as many sighs at the idiocy in the film as when I first saw the Blair Witch Project all those many years ago. Anyone like this would have surely died. But NO...no, the movie basically is yet another in a long line of tales made to lull the mediocre into being calm and ok with their useless selves. Theres little to truly edify anyone in such a tale.

Director: Michael Mathews
Starring: Dylan O'Brien, Jessica Henwick, Michael Rooker, Dan Ewing, Ariana Greenblatt etc
Overall rating 95/100Love and monsters is about a monster infested world that has wiped out 95% of the population, where a man called Joel (Dylan O'brien) learns that his former girlfriend is only 85miles away, he decides to make the dangerous journey to see her, and learns more about himself and becomes the hero along the way. What a pleasant surprise Love and Monsters was, it was absolutely fantastic, lets get started.My first few positives would be the fun opening, creative idea, character background and humour, as well as clearly and effectively setting up the story world. I think a film needs to get you interested and to watch more from the opening, and this is exactly what Love and monsters did, its opening sequence was fun it had good character background for the main character setting up his character arc effectively. It was a creative idea with a fresh enough twist on the monster movie with mutated animals being a cool and fun idea to play around with. I thought the movie also set up the story world of the movie very effectively, the movie had such a creative and fun story world that was explained in depth throughout the whole movie getting you even more invested in the movie and was very cleverly set up in this fun opening sequence of the film. I also found the movies humour was excellent, there was plenty of laugh out loud moments this was largely to the fun and excellent main performance from Dylan O'Brien as well as his fantastic comedic chemistry with the other actors involved within the movie.My next few positives would be the fun characters with interesting character traits, with great chemistry with each other the great cinematography and set pieces as well as the fantastic CGI/creature designs. I really loved the different characters and their fun personalities within this movie, every character had a fun and important role to play in each others development and felt needed within the movie which Is very rarely the case with the whole cast, I also loved the main characters personality traits he had different positives and negatives to himself that he needed to change and work on throughout the movie and the movie touched on this really well with incorporating it and linking it with past events in his life giving him a lot more character depth and sympathy from the audience. I also thought the whole cast had fantastic chemistry with each other, Dylan worked excellently with whoever was on the screen, the characters relationships with each other felt authentic and not forced and the comedic chemistry with a lot of the characters was excellent which is also praise to the script as well. I also thought the movie had excellent set pieces, they really added to the story world excellently, they were excellently crafted and detailed and incorporated the monsters and their different habitats excellently and was a really great element to the film. Finally I also thought that the cinematography and CGI was fantastic. For a film with a budget of only thirty million which is pretty low for this genre, Love and monsters had excellent cinematography. The CGI looked stronger than some of the bigger budgeted blockbusters and the creature designs were creative and fantastic so hats off to the creative team behind this.My next few positives would be the building of tension, Jumpscares, the movies heart-warming charm and character depth as well as the fun set up. The movie actually did a fantastic job at building tension and executing really good Jumpscares, the sound design was excellent and the creatures and the situations the characters were placed in genuinely had me on the edge of my seat, this was due to the movie really making you connect with the characters the detailed and scary design of the creatures and having the element of surprise with its well-executed Jumpscares. I also thought the movie balanced its more darker moments with a nice heart-warming charm and character depth, I was really surprised at how much depth they gave to Dylan O'Brien's character, his relationship with his parents and the little things he kept with them and them being the reasons for his flaws after seeing them die was actually fairly moving giving the movie a great amount of emotional weight that I wasn't expecting, because of this the movie had this heart-warming charm with its characters and how they developed with each other and the dog was obviously a big cause for the charm as well the film did a good job with incorporating the dog into the plot effectively and developing their relationship with each other. Finally, I thought the movie had en excellent set up for the rest of the movie. It effectively set up the story world and development of the main character in his bunker established the importance of his relationship with his ex well and added a clear motivational goal that got me excited for what was to come.My next few positives would be the great script, character development and development to the plot. The introduction to the new characters as well as how well constructed the plot was. I thought the script for the movie was excellent, the dialogue was great, it was well constructed and managed to convey great messages and themes to people watching. I also really liked the development to the plot and characters, the plot didn't follow a generic structure it made you think it would sometimes but then did something different to develop and change the plot, moving it into a different direction which I loved, I did also love the character development the main character showed real growth as the movie progressed, he found himself, rose above his flaws and became a better person and somebody the other characters could look up to which I loved. I also really liked the new characters introduced and how well constructed the plot was. I thought the performances from Michael Rooker and Ariana Greenblatt were fantastic and they were introduced perfectly, they not only served as great mentors to Dylan o'Briens character and gave him some great character development but I loved how their friendship developed and its something I would want to see more in a sequel, the plot in general was well constructed it hit all the necessary beats effectively with twists and turns plenty of conflict for the characters and resolution to that conflict as well as fantastic arcs for the characters as well.My only couple of slight negatives would be the slightly generic character types and the pacing issues in places. I thought that limiting Dylan O'Brien's character to being classed a 'wimp' or incapable of doing things was overplayed and fairly generic for the character, yes it led to a lot of development but I think that the main character should of become more active in terms of going against his fears earlier on in the film. I also found that there was just a few pacing issues, there was some parts of the film where I thought the plot dragged slightly or they were hitting similar and unneeded story beats but this was only on a few occasions but happened often enough for me to spot it.My final few positives would be the performances, action, villains and uplifting ending. I thought that the performances from the whole cast was excellent, especially Dylan O'Brien. He was charismatic, full of charm. His comedic delivery was excellent and he actually gave a lot of depth to his character which was fantastic. I also thought the action was very entertaining. The film always had you on edge and was well choreographed, it raised the stakes and the tension well and looked surprisingly realistic once again crediting the excellent CGI. I also thought the movie did a great job with the villains, having them teased throughout and then not revealed until slightly later on for me completely worked, as the first half of the movie was all based on the main characters journey, the villains had a nice twists you instantly disliked them and the action scenes on the beach were excellent and once again raised the stakes well. And finally, I loved the uplifting ending, the monologue was moving it ended the character arcs nicely and it gave the movie a lot of heart and a good message, whilst also cleverly setting up a potential sequel which I would love to see.Overall, I was truly surprised at how fantastic Love and monsters was, it had a mixture of everything. Charm, humour, emotion as well as genuinely fairly tense and scary moments as well. With great performances, loads of creativity and a well thought out and fun journey from beginning to end.",Love and Monsters

85,januszlvii,Above Average,7,14 September 2021,"Love and Monsters is an above average movie. While it is not The Godfather it is not Paradise Hills either. What makes the movie work is two things: Number one the dog ""Boy."" He is very important to the protagonist. Joel Dawson ( Dylan. O'Brien). Number two is the character growth of Joel. He is disrespected by the people he lives with in the pod where he lives after 95% of the population lives is killed. Only by going out to find the woman he loves Aimee ( Jessica Henwick) and after finding her saves her and the people in her pod by a corrupt former Australian Naval Officer named Dan and his friends who want to feed them to a monster Crab. He sees chains on the crab and realizes the crab is actually a prisoner and instead of killing the crab shoots the chains off of it. The crab realizing that Joel helped him leaves everyone alone and eats the bad guys instead. Spoilers ahead: Joel learned that the safest place from monsters is in the mountains and leaves Aimee
to help those in his pod. Of course, Aimee has to look for him in the mountains. He gains the respect of those in his pod because he went away and returned ( very few can last a week outside) and is showing the way to the mountains You do not know if he ends up with Aimee or will giant spiders who live there get him. The unnecessary ambiguous ending knocks one star off for me. I give it 7/10 stars.",Love and Monsters

88,Mcduff3601,A fun family movie,7,28 May 2021,"This could be viewed as a shallow movie with little character development and quick resolution. But if you watch it keeping in mind it's meant for younger kids to enjoy, it works.There are some entertaining battles, you do see an outline or shadow of someone getting eaten but that is about as gory as this movie gets. There is another scene were a bug gets blowed up but overall its more of the fun bugs are gross kind of feel to it vs a gritty end of the world feel.The love story is meh, they could have changed that to something else, like a family member or bff. Overall this was a surprisingly entertaining movie but it is forgettable and most likely one I will never bother to watch again. So watch, enjoy but don't expect great things.",Love and Monsters
89,Brooklynsmagicmike,Honestly it definitely exceeded my expectations.,9,15 May 2021,"Wasn't really sure what to expect from this movie because from the trailer it more of looked like a movie for teenagers. So I figured it might be bit corny or just not enjoyable for my age range. But upon conclusion I was begging for sequel because I liked it honestly so much.First the acting from all parties was good and especially from the lead actor Dylan O'brien. The movie also contained great mix of emotion, action, humor, and romance. On top of all that the visuals were amazing and sound effects as well. The only reason why I diddn't give it a 10 out of 10 was due to the slow beginning. But once this movie gets going from there its non-stop thrill ride.Would definitely recommend this movie to everyone and it definitely has alot of rewatchability.",Love and Monsters
90,patches89,"YOU STOLE FOOD, DIDNT YOU!!",7,9 May 2021,This is a fun little post apocalyptic film that didnt rely on zombies or vampires but just monsters.

Great monsters, nice special effects

Dylan O'Brian is not a capable enough actor to pull off a movie where he is the focus, often alone. Thin line between sympathetic, naïve and nerdy and outright stupid, whiny, annoying and completely incapable of this journey without help of multiple deus ex machina.Writing.....atrocious
Logic...what's that?Character development. We do not see the main character backstory or see him initially contacting his girlfriend so do not have a good understanding or empathy on why he would do the journey in the first place.I guess put this in the Jimanji category, if you like Jimanji(I didn't) you may like this.",Love and Monsters

97,carlos37andre,"Really, really good",8,3 June 2021,"I went to this movie, sort of expecting another one of those typical ""post-apocalyptic teenage movies"", and sure, there is some of that here, mainly with the ""Love"" side of the title, but even with that, the movie surprised me a lot.The concept might be the best thing, even tho the ""reason"" for the animals to become giants is a bit... lazy, that aside, I found the concept fascinating, and I honestly, hadn't seen anything like it anywhere else. It's pretty scary, and from the jump, in an oddly fun way, we are set up in a pretty frightening but intriguing world, that afterwards, becomes a lot sadder when you realize what most of those characters had gone through. So, yeah, I found the world, and the story fascinating, and I thought they actually did a pretty good job on setting up stuff, and that paying off afterwards. Of course, there are a lot of mysteries still hanging in the air, like, what's up with the previous owner of Boy? Is she dead? Is there really a huge colony on the mountains? What's up in the rest of the world? I think you got the point, but still, the script is well written and I think it explores a bunch of the world and it's a nice and round tour to this world.After seen the movie I keep remembering and sort of comparing it to ""Chaos Walking"", I've seen it recently, and I also thought it had a great concept, but instead, they don't exactly explore the world around it that much, and at the end you feel like you could have gotten more, and maybe even should have, but here they have a great mix of having a focal point and exploring ""the"" journey (to a certain extend), but alongside it you are able to learn a lot about the world, and you feel as if you are really having a big picture view everywhere you go with Joel, the same probably can't be said for Chaos Walking, even tho I liked the movie overall, this one is much better imo and it reaches way more of its potential than the other.Dylan O'Brien is pretty good, he's really charismatic, and I liked him since Maze Runner, so it's awesome to see him again in another good lead of an apocalyptic story. You feel for him, you feel his evolution through the story, and his development is, kind of awesome and super well-crafted imo. The journey of realizing that he had the right people around him all the time, but also finding the courage he needed through this journey to save and probably give a better life to the ones he loves is pretty cool. His relationship with Boy is great as well.My biggest issue with the movie tho, might be the romantical part, like, from the jump I knew this thing wouldn't end well, and like, sure, I get it, and it was obvious that she would have had found someone during this 7 year, buuut, why the hell the kiss at the end tho? That was sort of a detriment to the whole point made earlier, and I get it, post-apocalyptic world, people are horny af probably, but idk, it felt sort of pointless to make a huge thing out of ""oh Joel, I found someone else and he died"" just to kiss him 15 minutes afterwards. That's probably the only part I felt could have been handled way better.Besides that, I loved his relationship with Clyde and Minnow, it's super cute, I liked that he discovers that, some of the animals are just... not a threat at all and there is probably a possibility of co-existing with them, and overall I just liked the little things they set up through the film, and brought back afterwards, like the poisoned fruit, the eyes stuff. Oh, well, I just hopped they trusted the audience a bit more and stopped, cutting back to a voice over or an actual flashback of something we... just heard or saw, we know guys, we are actually smart enough. Still the set ups are pretty good, even with that.Also, give me a sequel with more Michael Rooker in it, please. And also the girl, Arian Greenblatt is actually pretty awesome in this, I thought she was really good, did a great job for a young actor, and had great chemistry with Michael Rooker, you really bought that they were probably on that journey for a while already.So, to sum up, Love and Monsters is a really good movie, with an awesome, exciting and new concept, that keeps you engaged from the jump, with a good and charismatic lead you care for and roots for the entire time, with a lot of complex characters along the way, and a light of hope at the end of the tunnel, and well, a good learning experience about appreciating what you haver around you (oddly enough). The romance doesn't land as well as they probably hoped for, but still, I get why is there. All in all, it's a really good movie, worth checking out.",Love and Monsters
98,ramisaakter,This is really good,7,5 May 2021,"I didn't have or keep high expectations but It was really enjoyable. Watching this during quarantine, somehow makes me feel better. Most surprising thing about this movie is an apocalypse movie without zombies. It didn't bore me at all, I was my edge of my seat whole time to see if Joel can ever be able to find his love Aimee. This is something new, something interesting. While all apocalypse movie focuses on survival techniques, killing zombies or monsters but main focus is to find his lost love whom he lost seven years ago. It is beyond expectations.

It took me a long time to watch watch movies like Jumanji, etc. I in fact I did not even like Jumanji. Thought it was too childish and boring. Because of that, I had low expectations from this film. But this movie is good. I didn't expect to like this film but I somehow ended up liking it. It's a pretty cool movie and deserves much more recognition than nonsensical films like Jumanji. Set in a post apocalyptic world, this film has a very cool plot with a very interesting set up in the start of the film that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. The dialogues are nice and the acting of the lead is pretty good too, unlike Jumanji, where you get to see too much of overacting. The lead is pretty likeable and interesting. There's a decent dose of comedy and emotions too. The CGI is amazing and the cinematography is just beautiful. Apart from being a visual treat, the technical aspects too have been taken care of pretty nicely. The monster action scenes keep you hooked and entertained. They're very well choreographed.

106,arabnikita,Fun and entertaining,7,12 May 2021,"When Love and Monsters first came out, I brushed it off as some teenage comedy nonsense. I mean who gives such a title to a post apocalyptic film? Many months laster, Sir_tone told me that this is a movie that grabs your attention within the first 10 minutes and it did just that. What's more, as it unfolded, I began to see a number of similarities to Zombieland in terms of narration, style and overall easy-goingness. One major difference is that instead of zombies, it had giant insects.I know it sounds kind of silly but the narrator does explain how these insects came to appear and considering that there are 200 million insects for every human, its no wonder they eliminated all life. After spending 7 years in an underground bunker and being fed up with that existence, our hero decides that he will travel 85 miles to meet the girl that he loved before the apocalypse. Yeah, yeah I know how it sounds but trust me, it's not like this. As a matter if fact, love will be the last thing on his mind because the new world doesn't allow for such luxuries.On his journey, he will meet people, fight of giant insects and discover a thing or two about life. I found Love and Monsters to be engaging the entire time because of it's light-hearted nature, entertaining narration and pleasant characters. The production team did a good job with the sick looking insects as well as the overall atmosphere. Despite being a post apocalyptic movie, there isn't much violence and the film preserves that easy-going feel the entire time. Don't judge the film by it's title and just give it a go if you are looking for a quick and entertaining movie.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movie and Tv show reviews.",Love and Monsters

I really enjoyed the combination of romantic comedy and sci-fi/horror. It was well written, the acting was on point, and the film direction was very good. I really enjoyed the world-building in this film. The atmosphere and monsters were done very well. The post-apocalyptic world in this film is much different than in others where it's dark and murky. This film was bright and colorful and really showed that after 95% of humanity was gone, the environment took over un-restricted. Planes buried in mountains covered in vines, buildings overgrown with plants and trees, etc....It just looked really really good. Also....bonus points for having the cutest dog I have ever seen in my entire life!

The premise for the monsters is daft, the characterisation is paper-thin, the humans are under-directed, the dialogue is pure exposition or say-what-you-see, and the plot is an absolutely basic quest to find lost love in a world of monsters.But that's exactly what's being promised, and it delivers on that. Dylan O'Brien turns in a competent enough performance as everyman Joel, although it does beg the question of why the competent and heart-breakingly beautiful Jessica Henwick would be with him. Because the plot requires it, is the answer.The pacing of the three acts are well judged, from Joel the Loser, to Joel the Learner, to Joel the Leader. And it's all good clean-language family appropriate stuff, with some mild peril, and a good doggo.

In fact, I think this is a refreshing one among a whole list of movies like 'Resident Evil' and more, franchises that might be good enough to conquer the genre, but sometimes cliché enough to bore at some point.That's the glow with movies like 'Zombieland' and 'Love and Monsters', its comedy relieves the audience and make the plot look a lot more relatable for us, the audience that doesn't know karate and will surely die in the first day of the end of the world... Joel is not your everyday badass superhero of an apocalyptic movie, and we love him for that, surely Dylan O'Brien was born to play him.'Love and Monsters' manages to, beside attaching us to him, to feel Joel's fears and live his flaws, we get to question ourselves in a nearly philosophical odyssey, settle or don't to settle even in the end of the world...we even actually get to cry.The film has that ""feeling"" that much sci-fi action movies lack and only approach by killing the sidekick or anyone else, and that's really worthy, so I'm really looking forward to a sequel or a TV show.

It's got some stunning visuals.
Dylan O'Brien is a fun dude.
It's a great story.
It's definitely entertaining.
Doggies are A+ always.
It's surprisingly unpredictable.
It is mildly funny.
Monsters are pretty dang cool.
It held my attention from start to finish.CONS:
The characters are pretty underdeveloped, it wasn't until much later on that I even liked Dylan O'Brien's character.
The attempts at comedy often felt awkward and fall flat.
The writing is not fantastic, hence the underdeveloped characters AND underdeveloped relationships between characters.
Due to the poor writing the dialogue seems a bit clunky and unnatural. Performances are just OKAY.In terms of grading scale, it's a B-. Worth a watch.",Love and Monsters

But sadly there wasn't many, there was a couple and they each looked really cool but didn't actually have much purpose in being in the movie, each one could have been replace by anything else...literally anything. The romantic side of the movie isn't that enjoyable it's pretty stupid actually and kind of takes you out of the whole world and vine of the movie. The visuals are great though. Some of the humour is good, a bit overused throughout...but good. The characters are kind of bland, I really had no interest in any of them besides the dog, cause the dog had the most emotion out of all the characters.

131,stermix501,slow and unrealistic,2,8 November 2020,"When a movie starts with an lengthy introduction explaining many things that happenned that you missed already, then you know there is nothing left to watch. I expected much better from Dylan O Brien. Maybe the character's writing was not good in the first place or maybe they should have chosen a younger actor.The plot is not great either. Monsters that decimated the entire planet's population and armies, consist half of them of insects that can die with one arrow and the other half of friendly monsters with cute eyes.The chemistry between the two leads is not there, there is no major surprise despite supposed twists. It feels like a 10 times unecessarily long mediocre episode of Love, Death and Robots.I should give it a 4 or 5, but I found myself missing The Horse Girl which was a solid 4-5.

This movie qualifies all.It was a surprise to see Dylan and Jessica pair up, although they have less screen time, they both are good. Michael Rooker and young Ariana are a delightful pair to watch. Although I wish they tagged along longer. But probably the highlight of this whole movie is Boy, the dog. He shines in every frame he is in. It was wise choice on writers part to have the protagonist and dog tag along. We don't see much of that these days.The action is cool. Sometimes the story comes to a halt but it's okay.

137,tmpsvita,Not new but kinda surprising,7,6 November 2020,"Love and monsters is not new, we have seen tons of movie like this one but here there's something that it's not that easy to find in this type of movie and that is an, even far, perception of depth. Not so much in the story, that's is actually pretty coomon, but in the leading character that is played by O'brien in a very empathetic and raw way that you really care about him and you really believe in his efforts and his spirit. And that's not nothing.
I was even surprised by the pace that's not only fast, noisy, chunky it's also capable of find slow moments that help the movie to don't rush and think about which is the right way to continue the story step by step.
Sad so the action scenes are nice, pretty smooth, clear and enjoyable and the cgi does its job.

140,Harry_Gleeson,Cliche but Entertaining,6,27 July 2021,"Pros:The Visuals - The standout from the film for me, apart from the dog, was the amazing VFX work. The world is simple but beautiful, the monsters are formed from everyday creatures but look very menacing and well thought through. There's no wonder it got nominated for an Oscar for the Visual Effects category.The Characters - Dylan O'Brien was a pleasant surprise as lead character, Joel. He brought good humour and tension. And the dog, boy, who is his companion is amazing. Very likeable.Mix of Genre's - I thought the film balanced well a variety of different genres including Horror/Thriller, Action/Adventure and Romance. Nicely doneCons:Predictable and Overacted - Various scenes were extremely cliche and exaggerated from the writing. And like most of these films, you can just tell where it's going. Which for me is a little annoying.Nothing Special - It's a film that, although it's well done, has been done before many times. Nothing truly groundbreaking.Overall, Love and Monsters was a decent film that had its good and bad moments. The visuals were superb but poor writing and cliche plot points meant it was nothing out of the blue. But an enjoyable adventure film.Quote - 'We're Monster killers' - JoelRating - 2.5/5.",Love and Monsters

He takes the journey to go to his girlfriend fighting mutated cold blooded animals and insects. The mutants are great, very well done. What this movie almost brings down is the childish script and jokes, the main character, the teenage boy, is constantly denigrated for no reason, even a little girl he meets on his journey insults him only for a couple of poor executed jokes.

Youngster Ariana Greenblatt brings the heart and humour to her role as Minnow.This is fun and funny, action filled and unlike most films, it is kind of how any normal person would cope.

150,shawnmikedryer,Great 2020 film,10,18 January 2021,"Such a refreshing cinematic experience given the turmoil each of us has faced this past year. Dylan O'Brian is a vastly underrated actor at this point and the man may have a franchise on his hands. Michael Rooker has recently taken up the most infectiously interesting roles and really appears to have great things in store for the sci-fi genre.Joel Dawson starts his day like any other day ending with his girl friend, but this night they witness a gigantic asteroid careen to Earth causing catastrophic chemical fallout. The fallout quickly spreads resulting in every cold-blooded animal mutating into larger more dangerous creatures immediately making human survival above ground unfeasible and nearly impossible. Joel and his girlfriend Aimee are separated when the evacuations are in progress, in the escape both Joel and Aimee lose both of their parents forcing the two into separate factions underground or elsewhere to survive this monsterpocalypse. Seven years pass and the two still separated, the thought that Aimee may still be out there and alive is really what keeps Joel going and the pure driving force of his being. Joel is lonely and this feeling only compounds by the day as his fellow colony members are survived by each significant other. Messing around with the radio as Joel is known to do he finally gets in touch with Aimee only to learn she is doing fine and residing in a coastal colony of her own creation some 80 miles away. Falling for her again as if it was pre destined, Joel rides these emotions when he decides to set out on land to reach his lost love, monster-infested world be damned. If the very beginning of his journey he meets a enigmatic middle-aged man and a very young girl, the two save Joel on more than one occasion while showing Joel more love and comradely than he's ever experienced since the incident. Also providing Joel with vital knowledge and know-how on surviving in this new apocalyptic world and also helping him develop a sort of survival guide. With this vital new awareness, Joel very may well now have the juice to reach his goals.",Love and Monsters
151,nodlimax,Reminds me a lot of Fallout,7,17 April 2021,"The basic premise is:
World apocalypse => most humans die => a few humans survive in bunkers => Survivor in one of the bunkers leaves due to some kind of mission and goes on an adventureFirst of all I enjoyed the movie for the most part. The outside world looks and feels natural and the environment seems to have been adjusted around the monsters. You can still see that the changes have been relatively recent (7 year time frame) but they very visible and also pretty reasonable.I like the side characters for the most part and especially the dog. The main character on the other as a bit hit and miss. I can enjoy his success and also chuckle about the failures. Still the whole love story aspect is just pure cringe and the outcome is very predictable. And unfortunately they play around a bit to much with the MC plot armor for my taste.Finally, do I believe that this scenario would happen? Not really. Even though the monsters shown in the movie are threatening and you want to see the characters succeed I do not believe that well equipped modern militaries would lose to a bunch of oversized lizards and insects.So this is a movie that can be watched and enjoyed at least once.

154,Joejoesan,"Percy Jackson, love and monsters",8,20 October 2020,"Love and Monsters is a movie that I enjoyed very much. It's similar to - I guess - Percy Jackson (young adult with monsters) and I liked the characters and the story.This post-apocalypse film takes place 7 years after the world ended and radiation created these giant bugs. Dylan O'Brien (The Maze Runner) plays Joël, a young man who has to travel 85 miles through savage land to visit his girlfriend who might be in trouble. Not being a hero (but he can cook and draw!) he's lucky to meet a guy named Clyde (Michael Rooker as a non-villain) and a young girl named Minnow. They both teach him how to survive this nasty world. He also finds a dog named Boy that will accompany him on his journey. Just in time he reaches the colony of his girlfriend...Of course, Love and Monsters is no Oscar material but the acting is good (Dylan is charming and I love Michael Rooker), the deserted world looks cool and the monsters are not scary, but fun. The dog looks fake sometimes, though. Storywise there are also some nice little surprises (the robot!). The movie even ends with a possibility for a sequel and I wouldn't mind that.A charming tale!

It's not a bad movie but really nothing special at all. Not worth paying any amount of money to see in theaters or rent.

160,MovieWarfare,Dylan O'Brien delivers in a Monster Apocalypse movie,7,18 October 2020,"Love and Monsters is a movie where I just watched it because it had ""Monsters"" in the title. I love monster movies and since new movies coming out are rare, I gave it a watch. The premise is simple ""Seven years after the Monsterpocalypse, Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien), along with the rest of humanity, has been living underground ever since giant creatures took control of the land. After reconnecting over the radio with his high school girlfriend, Aimee, who is now 80 miles away at a coastal colony, Joel begins to fall for her again. As Joel realizes that there's nothing left for him underground, he decides to venture out to Aimee, despite all the dangerous monsters that stand in his way"". So was this movie a ""monster"" good time or a large-bore?Firstly, the characters are all great. Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien) is a very frightened and nervous individual but gradually grows more confident as the movie progress which is done convincingly. Later on, in the movie Joel meets two survivors on the surface, Clyde (Michael Rooker) and Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt), who eventually teach Joel the ropes on surviving. Clyde is the cool teacher and Minnow is the very loveable sidekick. The best addition to this movie is the pet dog ""Boy"" who goes with our main character Joel on his journey. ""Boy"" adds an extra layer to this movie by giving Joel, and the audience, someone to care about on the journey and leads to some intense moments. The director, Michael Matthews, made a great choice in including a companion for Joel as the movie wouldn't have hit the same notes if it was just him. Also, dog companions are great anyway. There are some other characters like Aimee (Jessica Henwick), Joel's goal, and they are all pretty good as well.I do have to give a lot of praise to Dylan O'Brien as he is very charming and charismatic despite playing a kind of nerdy loser type character. He makes Joel seem very relatable and successfully makes us root for him. There are also some surprisingly emotional moments sprinkled in this movie and Dylan's performance is very good, to say the least in making us feel for him. There also some comedic moments and quips from our main character that for the most part land and none of it takes us out from the emotional core of the movie.Let's talk about the monsters, they are great. They all have freaky designs but still, look reminiscent of the animals that they mutated from. The movie only has a few monster moments that appear but it works. Every moment where a monster appears is intense and suspenseful. There is also a great world-building and rules set in the movie that I particularly enjoyed. Not all monsters are the same as each monster have different ways to be dealt with and some monsters who are not as aggressive which was interesting.If I had to give a flaw to the movie then it has to be the predictability and the cliches in the movie. The story isn't anything amazing and you can probably guess all the twist in this movie since it uses so many cliches that you would expect. Right from the first 10 minutes of the movie you can probably guess one of the twists near the end since it feels that incredibly cliche. The third act of this movie is not as good as the first two acts which were focused on the loneliness and struggle of our main character. The last act feels like a completely different movie with its over the top nature that is mostly dumb action rather than intense or suspenseful like the previous action set pieces.Overall, Love and Monster don't do much new but that's okay. In the end, the movie knows what it wants to be which is the growth of Joel on his journey with some monsters and it does that good. The movie has a lot of heart and sincerity that isn't in a lot of movies nowadays. The movie is carried by a great performance from Dylan O'Brien and I hope to see more of him in the future. I had a surprisingly good time with this movie and I believe you will as well.",Love and Monsters

Something that Jurassic does, so it lacks real tension.Strangely the dialogue seems adult-like whilst the monster side of things seem aimed at younger children.

And luckily it was true, although momentarily it made a super romantic like this super disappointing, but the situation changed! On the other hand, what does it say when a film like this gets tears in your eyes .., about success? Certainly at least for some.For others, this is light entertainment, but for myself this sank, of course also as light entertainment, but also as a rather emotional film.Not to mention the visuals and everything else, Netflix into a movie. Everything in the movie was beautiful. Filming locations, cgi and, in my opinion, high-quality acting performances.The biggest minus comes from the lack of 4k and HDR. No wonder this was published like that! At least here in Finland ..!?!?, Because other people of the same level do work in their own system ....",Love and Monsters

177,mmevanille-53097,Endearing,9,27 October 2020,"This is one of the best recent adventure films. It avoids many clichés that inhabit the genre, with small twists which made watching it a pleasure.Even though the action scenes were sort of predictable, it didn't deter away from getting absorbed into Joel's story and caring what happened to him and the other characters. It had some small lessons in it too, which added to the story.Its a little too adult for young children in my opinion. Young teens though would enjoy it.",Love and Monsters

So I watched it all and didn't cut it short because it did have some quality to it and I remembered Dylan from the Maze movies and liked him. I would have like to have some dialogue parts of the movie to move a little faster because you don't want to get bogged down in cinema. Nevertheless it had it's appeal.",Love and Monsters

Anyway this movie is a ""comedy""/""love"" story and not as boorish as zombieland monologues from #JesseEisenberg where listening to him is the grand master of boring.Movie graphics are good and the monsters are believable. The characters are generic and very good and the dog is cool. It is a simple storyline with a simple message love is greater than 2 people. The cast picked was a great choice, it is a great adventure for younger children, there is no profanities and the most is a kiss is has saucy as it gets.

The events depicted in the movie, take place 7 years after the events that caused the insects to grow, BUT it would appear Joel has learned absolutely nothing about how to survive.
Just imagine your playing a really tough RPG game, set on extra hard and the companion your given, is the level 1 village idiot, (That's Joel).

195,cristinalinderman,A fun-loving comedic film.,8,18 October 2020,"* There is no end credit scene *The director Michael Matthews and crew brought a fun-loving comedic film. The story is by Brian Duffield and he has written a few movies I loved and now he has done it again. The story sets in a world filled with monsters and Joel makes a dangerous journey to be with the one he loves. The movie is a light charming adventure and having the lead character as the narrator makes everything feel more chipper. Also, the addition of the dog made it more enjoyable and he had so many great moments. As it is already mentioned in the title it is all about love while the monsters are the wall keeping them from it and this film shows how something impossible can be possible. It doesn't take it literally as a simple love, it is way bigger than that it directs on how to take risks to live the life you will love. I'm really eager for a sequel because this film needs one so desperately and hopefully next time they focus more on the monsters.The composers Marco Beltrami and Marcus Trumpp gave this film the humor and the post-apocalyptic atmosphere with their music. It isn't something to grasp and yet it's just as simple to make this film work.The cast was incredible, Dylan O'Brien was hilarious as the narrator and his acting skills were spot on. Jessica Henwick was fantastic as well and I hope for a sequel for her to get more screen time. The storyline of them was perfectly executed there was no better way to unfold their story, loved how realistic it was. Now Michael Rooker and Ariana Greenblatt were a badass-fun duo one of the best things this movie had. They were the backbone, without them the film could have gone into another route and of course, the dog also dominated every scene.",Love and Monsters

If you consider the number of years the guy's already lived without the girl and all of sudden he feels he can't live without her, and had to go on an impossible journey, that's crazy.

210,Tron79,adventure gaming at its best,8,16 October 2020,"As I started watching this movie, I thought this is the same basic plot as 90% of the computer adventure games I played in my teenage years (many years ago). The premise of those adventures centered on embarking on a perilous quest to save the princess (or girlfriend). In this case, the perilous quest involved avoiding huge mutated insects that have taken over the world. Our hero had plenty of room to grow along his journey, since he started out as the least likely to survive two minutes on the surface let alone 7 days.I decided to rent this movie because ""the girlfriend"" was played by Jessica Henwick. Henwick starred as one of the ""Sand Snakes"" in Game of Thrones. She was also the only bright spot for me in the ""Iron Fist"" series.Some of the best moments are when our hero meets up with a man and an 8 year old girl who teach him ""the rules of survival"". His dog ""Boy"" was also totally awesome.I enjoyed going along for the ride in this movie. It gave me 108 minutes of escapism where I didn't have to worry about politics or anything in our real world. It had an excellent third act, and if I was in a theater I may have applauded some. I only gave 8 stars because it was total escapism, and it really didn't have much to say about the world, other than perhaps suggesting that lockdowns may not be the way to go in our current pandemic. But I don't think they were thinking that deeply.",Love and Monsters

Ok, so it's PG13, but I seriously didn't mind this at all, the amount of action, gore, violence and fast pace of this movie was great. The main character is likeable, and Michael Rooker was a great get! It was clear to me, being an Aussie, that this movie was filmed in Australia, the scenery and landscape is unmistakable and fit perfectly with the overall themes and the look of the world. But what I liked above the monsters, entertaining interactions, interesting cast, and pace was lack of pretension. The plot can get weak at times, it's hard to believe that a frightened to death lead character who is suffering from PTSD and freezes at the sight of any monster can somehow decide to travel 85 miles above ground after having lived in a bomb shelter for forever just to find a girl he hasn't seen in 7 years!?! There was little to no backstory, say for a couple of flashbacks, to allow the viewer to invest in their respective story pre COVID... Errr I mean, Apocalypse... but the blistering pace and interesting supporting cast sort of made up for that, or at least it made me care more about the journey rather than the reasons...",Love and Monsters

The story is very well written & doesn't take itself too seriously. The basis felt like 'Zombieland' crossed with 'The 100' & this film had lessons (like Zombieland had Rules) & in The 100 they needed to know if the ground was survivable. In this, after 7 years of living underground, going outside is a massive task. The adventure is just a whole lot of fun, Dylan does an incredible job especially with his comedic timing which I didn't know he had. The scenes with Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt)) & Clyde (Michael Rooker) who he meets on the way are great additions & add so much to the film. Boy (the dog) is such a hero & worth watching just for him! Overall I think this film is a whole lot of fun with a ton of heart & about living, growing & not being afraid of what might happen. Just live a day at a time.",Love and Monsters

What a great message. It really hit home.Anyway, I can't remember any specific flaws to the movie. It was fun, it had its moments of emotion and it had it's moments of suspense.

224,TheLegendOfThe42,Surprisingly entertaining and well-made!,7,19 October 2020,"Ignore all the picky nay-sayers on this one, I say. Now, I'm not exactly the fan of family-friendly feel-good movies or any such thing, but I do love me some imaginative and well-done movies, no matter what genre.""Love and Monsters"" is at least very entertaining, at best even a very inspiring and unique movie in these times. Is the plot original? Not really. The premise? Nah. But I hope you know the secret: you don't have to reinvent the wheel to make a good and entertaining movie. Take a nice script and a great director, take out all the identity politics that you might feel tempted to throw in, and trust that it'll be fine. And fine it is indeed. The world building is nothing short of impressive here, just visually. This film is an example of how you can create an absolutely convincing world without tentpole budgets, and it's done by creative decisions all the way. Just like in ""Dredd"", you will find that some nice establishing shots are enough to create immersion. However, that doesn't mean that the more complex creature shots aren't pretty good as well. Compliments to the filmmakers for making the budget count - there wasn't a single shot that took me out of the movie, not one.As for the acting, there wasn't a single actor that was bad. Everyone was decent at least, but some were outstanding - like Michael Rooker and Ariana Greenblatt. Their screentime is limited, but they're pretty much the best characters in the movie. I would love to see a spin-off with those two, to be honest, and I haven't felt like that in a long time. Dylan O'Brien does a great job as well, and with some dialogue tweaks it would have been even better. But who am I to complain? Well done, indeed!If anything, I would have given the whole script one or two more drafts to sort out some of the dialogue, but yeah, that's probaly just me.So, if you want to see some nice post-apocalyptic love story with a wholesome twist, some amazing dog acting performances and a really nice score, coupled with some visuals that are actually almost too good for this budget, then dive right into it.

Despite how the world is during the movie, there's a lot of goofy, quirky moments I found highly enjoyable. Although I would've liked the plot to be a bit farther from the obvious, it still didn't bother me too much and from enjoying the movie. Joel is very likeable and you easily get fond of seeing him, but he's not as two-dimensional as you'd think.Love and Monsters is, hands down, one of the most charming movies I've seen in a while. It's not the best movie there ever was, but it manages to do something so few films fail in - it keeps you interested all the way through and afterwards you have that rare satisfaction of just seeing a well-done & well-written movie. Maybe discarding the PG-13 could've made this one better for a more mature audience, but I'd say the overall enjoyment is still pretty high level.",Love and Monsters

It has a plain, simple plot (and don't try to put it through the ""credibility test"", because it will fail miserably), predictable and cliched. There's not a lot of character development either. It has some humor (not very good), and some heartwarming moments (kinda...). Overall it's entertaining (considering it's intended for kids and teens), but forgettable.",Love and Monsters

Maybe if aliens were the enemies it be ok but given that monsters were the enemy, I expect a little carnage. And every time he defeated a monster they play victory music?! Seriously?! Like it's home alone?! But all in all it was aight but lil lame for my taste.",Love and Monsters

242,jwcstorage,"SPOILERS: Bad, REALLY predictable, kinda dumb",2,21 October 2020,"This feels like babies first apocalypse movie.
EVERYTHING is a trope in this, but not in any kind of fun ""lets play with this trope"" way.If you're a YA, this movie might be passable, but only one where this is their first introduction to 'media'. NOTHING PRIOR!!! Including anything as technologically advanced as cave paintings. Might be too many tropes in those cave paintings.The plot is essentially: Young guy runs away from 'home' for 'love', and once he gets there, he realizes that young love was not what was important, but the journey here, the friends he's made along the way, and the 'family' back home that still love him.This movie feels like they copied Zombieland, removed the jokes, removed any clever bits, realized they had only 32% of a script left, photocopied a few pages to fill in the blanks and kind of slapped this together.The effects are fine. They dont look straight from a TV show, or from a DC movie.
Thats really the only positive I can add.Acting was weak. Story was bad. Love interest part was pointless. Main character should have been killed LONG ago in this world, as should the other colony.Re-watch Zombieland. Your night will be better for it.",Love and Monsters
243,napchier,Had something of a Spielburg feel to it.,10,24 July 2021,"Oh I LOVED this! Here's a lovely little review I found among these reviews on IMDB for this, which summed it up perfectly ""A great mockumentary depicting every day life in Australia!"" Anyway, it feels like a movie straight out of my childhood, 80s early 90s - I mean this in a good way of course. I wish I saw it in the cinema (don't think it made it thanks to Covid). Made me cry twice! The monsters are great, though the last one is a bit meh (despite it being meaningful in other ways) - that's a minor gripe though. 10/10 might be over the top, but it touched a lot of buttons for me.",Love and Monsters
244,stellansson,Are teens this stupid?,2,15 April 2021,"I managed to suffer 15 minutes of this garbage.

245,TMAuthor,A Great Escapist Watch,7,1 November 2021,"No, not a 10, or a 9...maybe an 8 if I stretch my rating scale a bit, but entertaining and funny. Building on the new sub-genre of ""rules for the apocalypse"" the story moves quickly, warmly and humorously as we follow our hero on his quest for idealized love. Dylan O'Brien gives the lead role the right mix of self deprecating humor, naive nobility and determination. Supporting actors vary in terms of their performances, but the key ones are done well and THE DOG is terrific. The cgi is okay, if a little inconsistent. Some creatures are incredibly well done whereas there's two that are much less convincing. It helps that they're featured in scenes of comic relief.You won't finish this thinking you've watched cinematic excellence, but if you allow yourself to buy in to the premise and look away from one or two stretches of questionable motivation, it's a very fun watch.",Love and Monsters

It will make you laugh (a lot), feel scared, and maybe even cry. Ariana Greenblatt is sooooo talented. I hope she sticks with acting cause she blew me away.

""What if a monster gets the dog??"" ""What does the dog eat??"" ""Who picks up the poop"" ""is the dog micro chipped?""

254,ratpackaustin,Very unexpected and very good,9,8 February 2021,"I hadn't heard of this movie until accidentally stumbling across it on my fire stick cinema app. I thought it was going to be an average movie with poor special effects and acting. I was extremely surprised and delighted to find that the acting and VFX were phenomenal. The movie is simple and slightly unoriginal, but executed to perfection and gives a small twist to the apocalypse genre. Dylan O'Brien is becoming one of my favorite actors and should be proud to have this movie under his belt",Love and Monsters

Great writing, likeable characters, solid world building and no agenda apart from that of hope and a spirit of adventure.The movie handled the emotional and comedy elements very well. In the movie, the journey of the character and his spiritual and emotional development in this journey are very well explained to the audience.The film does have some exciting action sequences with them escaping from monsters and fighting back. The visual effects are great. The music score was good. The film does have a climatic battle on the beach with a giant like crab of a monster.Dylan O'Brien did great playing the character. Adding emotional depth to his journey in reuniting with his love. After feeling isolated from losing his family. And being separated from Aimee. Michael Rooker and Ariana Greenblatt did good too. Jessica Henwick was also great playing in a brief role.",Love and Monsters

The story is entertaining, but like, because the movie as a whole is so enjoyable, you'll wish is was longer.. to see more of the new world and whatnot, to see more Clyde and Minnow <<< That could've been a whole movie on it's own - great side characters, I wish they were in the whole movie.",Love and Monsters

And failsI don't think even the film makers knew who their target audience for this film is, falling as it does between adult horror/comedy and teen thriller.

I was so surprised how great it was. Great writing, acting, directing. It was such a treat I told others and watched it over again just 2 days later. Loved the dog actor and the lead the most.

It reminded me of Rampage which was also a good movie.However, I was disappointed with the story. It was just too predictable and the main lead got away with anything and everything. I would've love to see more twists and turns and also more unpredictable scenes. In addition, the main character seemed too weak to be the main character. The little girl had more of a stronger presence in the movie than the main character. Disappointed with the execution of this movie.It's a good movie for kids but adults will find this movie extremely predictable.",Love and Monsters
272,ItsCN,Great fun,7,22 October 2020,"It was a great movie, I accept it.. it really made me laugh a lot and entertained me a lot too but there was a basic mistake, and that is when the chemical from the nuclear weapons created such enormous mutations in insects then how come humans are still the same? I mean if those chemicals affected the insect they should've affected humans and animals too right? I mean after all we are on the same land, breathe same air, eat almost veg/non-veg, so it should've affected humans too, Right? Other than that, movie was a lot of fun.",Love and Monsters

274,nennejoh,Amazing acting,9,4 November 2020,"One of the best things about this movie is the characterization, man they did a great job. I mangaged to care about every single character in this movie, and that is so rare nowadays. It was belivable in the sense that the characters were all so human, the dialoge was great and so was the acting. I first saw Dylan O'briens acting in Teen Wolf, and since then I've wanted to see him get to use his talent. He was good in maze runner, and in american assasin, but here he SHINES. Every single muscle in his face just sells thw preformance to me, he is there, in a world of monsters. And that dog was really cute too. Only thing I wish it would've been longer and that we get to see more of minnow and the survivalist guy. It's not a mind blowing concept or something I will remember for the rest of my life, but it is a good friday night movie to watch with friends or family. I need a sequel.",Love and Monsters

284,Weirdo-Magnet,Good fun,8,21 November 2020,"First of all. People complaining that is a kids movie, saying it's for 5 year old, saying I'm an adult so didn't enjoy it. Where is your sense of fun? Adventure? Why has the child in you had to disappear because society tells you to grow up? You can be mature and still have a bit of fun and let the child out every so often
Anyways, this movie was good fun. Not the best plot, but it's an adventure. The monsters are a bonus and in my opinion are well designed. The main character is ok, but the dog steals the show. The end scene was a bit over the top but it reminded me of the old monster movies like Clash of the titans and Sinbad. This brought back lots of childhood memories for me.

Especially Ariana Greenblatt and Michael Rooker performed very well.The plot was maybe simple, but really gave me a nostalgic vibe. The kind of family movies we don't see that much anymore.

He loved it just as much as me.Does it have similarities to other apocalypse movies? Yes. It's the way it is executed that sets it apart.

301,ruidanielbarrossss,Great Apocalyptic Feel-Good Movie.,8,16 October 2020,"""Monster Problems"" has action, fantasy, comedy, survival and even love. It is a film for the whole family, but it manages to be quite tense, especially in action scenes involving monsters.The characters are excellent. Dylan O'Brien proves once again that he can be a one-man show, Michael Rooker is great as ""Michael Rooker survival samurai""; and the dog is just fantastic. Other secondary characters also do not fail.The design of the creatures is perfect; and adorably scary. And the main theme of the film, which basically tells the story of a person leaving the suffocating comfort of his hiding place to find something that makes him happy, in the midst of a pandemic of monsters, I think it is something that will touch the sensitivity of many people that now live the dramas of self-isolation.It's the best post-apocalyptic film I've seen in a long time, a pleasant surprise that came out of nowhere, and I recommend it to everyone, even the cynics.I give this movie 8 stars out of 10.",Love and Monsters
302,pachomar84,Surprisilingly good! If you liked Zombieland you will dig it,9,17 April 2021,"Honestly I watched this on Netflix with the lowest excpectations. Unknown actor names, a dumb movie name and the premise sounded like a another cheap apocalypse movie we see so much. The characters are kinda cliche sure, but the movie is amazing. From how it shows bits of how the apocalypse started, to the amazing journey of the MC (and of course, his dog. Man! Best dog mate since ""I'm legend""). It has Zomieland vibes all over it, from the MC personality, to the companions he meets on the trip. The main arc of the love-inspired trip ends kind of like you would excpect it, but the visuals of the monsters are incredibly well done (this movie didn't had a low budget in cgi, thats for sure). I'm totally hoping for a sequel, but seeing how many years it took Zombieland to get one this might never happen, but hey, we can always hope.",Love and Monsters
303,Cr0wgrrl,Fun and lighthearted kaiju action movie,8,22 January 2021,"There's nothing deep in this movie, but it's solidly fun to watch. Dylan O'Brien is a lot of fun as a hapless adventurer who must learn how to survive in a post-apocalyptic world full of kaiju-sized bugs. I appreciated that the movie decided to take a modern view on the traditional ""damsel-in-distress"" trope and actually added some needed drama and insight into what could otherwise have been much more stereotypical and flat. Michael Rooker is, as always, a delight to watch. I'm sad I couldn't see this on the big screen (curse you Covid-19).",Love and Monsters
304,mikeferguson,Nothin' but fun!,10,25 November 2020,"Wait for it to be $10 or less if you must...it will wait for you and still deliver its full measure of movie magic; but if you can safely swing the $20 purchase price currently being asked, I'd say pony up, because the makers of such a special presentation certainly have earned the right to earn their money back on this one, and in these weird days a risk deserves a reward, yes? This is a fun movie that will withstand many watchings, and will be a treasured part of your collection for many years to come...consider it an investment in joy that will pay dividends for as long as you remain able to find the Play button.
Remember: the secret is in the eyes! (That will be explained once you've seen the movie...otherwise it probably just sounds very much like a non sequitur!)

305,imdb-20212,Mister Magoo Meets the Apocalypse,4,27 March 2021,"The main character is pretty unlikable - I get that they were shooting for a more humorous narrative, but did they have to make him so weak and pathetic in the process?There's the whole character arc element going on, where we see him develop during his journey, but honestly, he should have died many times over and was only saved by some pretty ridiculous deus ex machina interventions.I was rooting for the monsters by this point. The kid just didn't have the chops to survive, and in any truly Darwinian sense, he shouldn't have. I shudder to think of the future of the human race descending from this pathetic gene pool.Rated just a 4 because I was so annoyed at the main conceit of this weakling, who freezes up when faced with danger, deciding he's going to make this trek. Unbelievable. But then he does, and the movie is basically just him ""Mr. Magooing"" his way along - alternately getting into danger by his own idiocy, and also saved miraculously in silly ways.I think the real hero's journey is if you're able to finish watching this movie.",Love and Monsters
306,mbnn,A lot of fun and pretty good!,8,17 October 2020,"This movie was something completely unexpected, good acting, great VFX and a pretty decent story line. Loved it and it's pretty ok for the entire family to watch.",Love and Monsters
307,glenn_gallagher,I hope the Apocalypse is this fun !!!,8,16 October 2020,Really enjoyable movie and not as predictable as you'd think. I was surprised how funny and original 'Love and Monsters' was considering the overdone genre but it is an adventure worth taking. If you're looking for a decent weekend flick then I strongly recommend you give it a go.,Love and Monsters
308,erica-785-692529,Pleasantly surprised,10,24 October 2020,"I loved this movie! I was expecting something very stupid, while not Oscar worthy it was nice escape from politics and covid. Very cute and worth the watch!",Love and Monsters
309,david-fernandez,"Like an old school 1980s ""light"" action adventure movie DONE RIGHT !",10,17 April 2021,"I was a bit cynical before I started watching Love and Monsters but it was at No.1 in my country so I gave it a shot and I'm really glad I did.It's got this 1980s feel good 'vibe' about it, like those 1980s kids movies and TV shows that Spielberg did back then. The CGI is great and the 'dad joke' humor is all there but some moments were quite moving.",Love and Monsters
310,soulfx-1,Zombieland with Insects,7,24 April 2021,"If you've seen Zombieland - you've seen this movie.The narration, the guide, the setting and the characters all mirror much of what you've seen in the original Zombieland. The difference is that instead of zombies, it's mutant insects that somehow got radiated by fallout from nuclear missiles that were shot into space.Ignoring the nonsensical origin story, it follows the tropes of action movies - loser boy falls in love with girl, seeks to meet her again, makes friends along the way who help train him, hero uses training to survive and meet girl and defeat evil villains. Happily ever after.",Love and Monsters
311,ericfield-53542,"Loved, Love And Monsters!",8,4 February 2021,I didn't expect much from this movie. I read a couple reviews and it sounded promising. It was actually really good. It's not going to win any awards but not every movie is made for that reason. The story was good and the acting was really good. I never found myself hating the actors for being so dumb. Which happens in the end of the world type movies. I'd actually really like to see a sequel. As long as they stick to what made this movie good. If you like action adventure with some humor and nothing you have to follow too hard then this is definitely a movie to watch. ✌🏽,Love and Monsters
312,Gabriel4416,At last something original,9,25 October 2020,"Of course there is hardly a way to make a movie about the post apocalyptic world and the struggle of those who survived absolutely original but still this movie stands out from the boring CGI focused shallow stuff by managing to find a balance between being a light hearted nearly comedy like flick and a thrilling sci-fi action horror.
It's got a likable underdog type hero with a great character development arc and some other life like, interesting characters including a really cute doggo.
I actually consider it a far better recent attempt to make a good humanity fighting to get its world back genre than any of the new Terminator movies.",Love and Monsters
313,kunalverma-98631,Emotional and fun ride,10,19 October 2020,"First of is there anything that dylan can't do. He is such a great actor. Movie was hell of a ride from the beginning. Fun , emotional, humor, action....it has all the elements to be called a great movie.",Love and Monsters
314,browndaniel-36205,Awesome delivery,9,12 November 2020,I have watched this movie more than 5 times... Freaking love it,Love and Monsters
315,Sickpuppy365,I love love and monsters,7,17 October 2020,"Everyone involved in the making of this movie should be proud. Yes the plot is simple and it's been done many times in this genre and several others, like for instance The road, or The book of Eli or 28 days later... But in this case more like Zombieland if it was rated PG-13.
Dylan O'Brien plays Joel, a character much akin to Jesse Eisenberg's ""Columbus"", a kind of neurotic and unwilling protagonist out of his depth, who is rescued by Michael Rooker (playing Woody Harrelson's ""Tallahassee"") the grizzled survivalist with the adorable Minnow (Arianna Greenblatt playing Abigail Breslin's ""Little Rock"") in tow, whilst on a quest to find his love interest Aimee (the lovely Jessica Henwick playing Emma Stone's ""Wichita"")... Confusing?
Not really. It's a post-apocalyptic road trip monster filled action love story movie that is a romp and a riot.
It's not often you get to see a movie where even it's weakest link is still holding strong... The dialogue is witty, the scenery is beautiful but appropriate, CGI game is strong most of the time, and cinematography crisp & clear, no lightening cuts and shaky camera. All the cast brought their A-game.
Hero and Dodge lent so much emotion to their joint portrayal of ""Boy"" the dog, they both must be very good boys... and Mavis the robot could almost pass the Turing test.
You may have to suspend belief a bit in a couple scenes... But just remember you are watching a movie with giant frogs and snails and it shouldn't be too difficult. For me it's a 7 but a strong one.",Love and Monsters
316,leoocampo,Could have been great.,5,7 March 2021,"Love and Monsters tries really hard to be Zombieland. But, it's Zombieland shoe-horned into a PG-13 rating, and custom-tailored for tweens. There are some decent chuckles to be had among the films overt attempts at building up inside jokes for call-backs, and there was a core to the plot that could have held up a much more substantial script than this flimsy one, even though it itself is a pretty old trope at this point. Among the other redeeming qualities is a pretty enjoyable performance by Michael Rooker, who manages to convey more depth of character with less screen time than any of the other cast members who had far more opportunity. I'm truly mind-boggled at the glowing reviews and ratings this film has gotten, because it's flaws seem quite obvious. Perhaps I'm just not the intended audience for this one...",Love and Monsters
317,fimdb-69588,Good entertainment even if low budget and cheesy at times,7,25 December 2020,"If you are expecting high budget CGI monsters, don't bother. The monsters are Jim Henson-ish. One of them is very Tremors-ish. The robot is about as low budget as you can get. However, make no mistake. The cheesy monsters bring a comic flair to this film which is right on point and intentional.I got this film just to see Dylan O'Brien in his most recent film. I rented it cheaply from a convenience store DVD vending machine. I definitely got my money's worth. As usual, Dylan O'Brien shines as the lead character. His character is played with subtle but effective humor. He does a good job of stealing the heart of all the characters in the movie as well as you as the viewer.Loved the dog. Loved the little girl and her adoptive father. I will no doubt watch this film again if I ever see it available for free on TV or one of the streaming services I subscribe to.",Love and Monsters
318,richardbarton-62945,Better than expected,7,26 April 2021,"It's a bit of a teen romance film , unrequited love meets monster apocalypse.Characters are likeable, story line is simple. It was an enjoyable film to watch, it's never going to win awards but fun nonetheless.",Love and Monsters
319,momster64,Nice!,9,12 January 2021,"As people have said, the plot is a direct rehash of Zombieland; young male protagonist with 4th wall commentary, Michael Rooker doing his best Woody Harrelson impersonation, the trek to someplace safe, numbered list of survival rules, the ""does she or doesn't she"" love me female interest, yadda yadda..
That all could have spelled disaster, but it was done really well, good writing and dialogue, good acting, if Covid-Palooza had not happened, I hope this would have been in the theater rather than on my tiny tablet. Great movie!",Love and Monsters
320,clairelou2008,Fantastic movie,9,21 April 2021,What a brilliant movie! Absolutely worth a watch! Loved it from start to finish. Ignore the bad reviews. Would watch this again and again!,Love and Monsters
321,markwha,"For a PG-13 apocalyptic sci-if, it's about as good as it gets",6,19 April 2021,"You can almost always tell a lot about how a film will play out given its genre and rating so it shouldn't come as a surprise that the plot was a little thin, quite predictable and shamelessly cliche. Usually I'll skip on films like this, but today I decided to give it a go and while I wasn't blown off my feet, I certainly wasn't disappointed either.It was well shot, well acted, well cast and Bertrami's scores were on point as they always are. These will never be enough blood and gore along with shocking, suspenseful moments in a PG13 sci-fi and forget about sex scenes but this film does a good job of checking the rest of the boxes. Certainly well worth a watch!",Love and Monsters
322,getting2me,great movie,9,28 October 2020,"If you like Zombieland, this movie should be right up your alley. Joel, the main character, is a very likeable guy and he has a great dog. And then throw in Michael Rooker and Minnow....you got the makings of a good movie. It was much much better than I was thinking when I went into it. It was very entertaining. The FX on the monsters were really well done. The plot and story are great. Now this is the kind of movie that I would love to see them make a sequel. And once you watch you'll know why.",Love and Monsters
323,garyhbradley,Good fun,8,14 August 2021,"Simple plot, teenage post apocalyptic love / survival / story. Dylan O'Brien is great, as usual but little Ariana Greenblatt is brilliant. Enough said! Just good fun.",Love and Monsters

But lo and behold, this movie was none of these things. It was visually impressive, engaging, and just all around a good movie. The trailer doesn't do it justice.
I'm hoping this is the first in more to come, as Netflix has been dropping the ball quite continuously in recent years. This movie has heart.",Love and Monsters

327,john_sprocket,Good fun. Almost great.,7,24 October 2020,"This movie tries its hardest to avoid the true love cliche, it really does. But in the end, there it is. This movie was so close to being something fresh and original and great. But it was still just a little trite. Perhaps some studio exec got hold of it, I don't know.It was still fun. I still liked the characters.",Love and Monsters
328,ThaliaDavies,This Is the Kind Of Apocalyptic Movie We Need Right Now,9,16 April 2021,"The storyline is a bit flimsy and yes they took liberties with the infamous ""End Of Zee World"" video for the opening scene. That all said this is fun, a few moments of Edge of you seat, the Heart of Wall-E and a couple of Twists. As wholesome as the end of the world gets without feeling like the Brady Bunch.",Love and Monsters

This came out in the shambles that was 2020 and got completely overlooked much like every other piece of media that year. But don't sleep on it.It takes inspiration from some great films from the post-apocalyptic genre. From Zombieland to Monsters, it never feels like a ripoff of them but rather a loving homage to the films that inspired it. It never takes itself too seriously but it never takes that turn into cheese or becomes overly predictable.This is a good time. Highly recommended.",Love and Monsters
331,emanueljicmon,"So so, teenage drama",5,23 October 2021,"The movie was ok, nice effects but the non romantic story kinda was fast forwarded and the whole movie became about a teenage trying to find his girlfriend from high school and him running from monsters in an endless forest.",Love and Monsters

336,kcquail,A good movie,7,17 April 2021,Nothing crazy here. Just a pure entertaining adventure movie. Exciting with a bit of humour and emotion. Overall I was entertained. It wasn't anything special but it did it's job. A solid movie.,Love and Monsters
337,sverre-797-353313,A good way to spend an evening,8,24 October 2020,"There is a lot wrong with the dialogue. It makes me wish I had set up a web site called ""Things they SHOULD have said"".
But all in all, it's pretty good, and it ends well, without any major mistakes.
Maybe except the huge things that moves faster underground than most things do under water. I mean, laws of nature? The hunt would be so energy consuming it would burn more calories than it would catch. If it was even possible to do for any thinkable creature, (that's why I don't like Dune).
But that's normal Hollywood (etc...) errors. Just make us scared, a stressed people is a good people... really?
But it's very entertaining and the actors do a great job. Graphix are awesome, not perfect, but awesome.
Some good giggles. Some emotional moments.
Well worth it for a 55 year old fantasy nerd :-)
I feel it could have been more like a Disney movie, less fright and more love, but that's me.

A coming of age story set after the end of civilization as we know it. There is humor, action and the right amount of peril to thrill, but not terrify. Even my husband said he was pleasantly surprised by how much he enjoyed it.

Compare it to skull Island where you can understand that everything is out to get you. Don't forget in this world 95% of the world's population has been wiped out by 'the event'...that puts it up there with the world of I Am Legend, which was clearly very dangerous.It lost some of the energy of the opening act quite quickly.Although there was some really touching moments (the dog dress and robot) it never really lit the fuse for me.I would still recommend a watch, but I couldn't rate it a 7, which in my book earns a Blue Ray purchase and rewatch.Thank you kindly.",Love and Monsters

What it lacks in its very simple story it makes up for with its snappy script, pretty funny, exciting set pieces, a great central performance from Dylan O'Brien (ably supported by the likes the always reliable Michael Rooker) and a real heart at its center. It won't change your world but it will certainly provide entertainment for your whole family. More of the likes of this from Netflix would be great. So much fun. Oh and it's got a lovely dog too. What more do you want?",Love and Monsters

Hearkens back to the good old days of adventure films and a bit of coming of age films as well. The protagonist Joel is controlled by his fear and it takes his love of a girl to strike out on a quest to find her in a world where mutated (from tiny to huge) cold-blooded creatures and insects have taken over the world. There are a few Deus Ex Machina events thrown in there, and it is pretty predictable but that's OK - none of it feels out of place. Nothing to complain about as far as production values (sound, camera work, score, lighting, etc). An enjoyable family movie for sure.",Love and Monsters

Simple story that waste no runtime to set the premise early on, and it's all that's needed to make it work.
The characters all do their job well, even if Michael Rooker is a bit underused.
O'Brien does an excellent job as always, he might have played the same role before, but I can't complain when it works so well in the story.Overall well worth a buy. Highly recommended to anyone loving fantasy movies, with a HEART.",Love and Monsters

369,eltechshops,Worth watching if the popcorns are done,7,24 August 2021,"I am gonna be honest I had low expectations for this movie but it was an enjoyable experience. The main character is not someone born to be a supehero in a "" post apocalyptic"" world. No . He is you and me ( no offence ) . Risking his life for love and in meantime searching for his confidence is what makes this movie an adventure of everything a person needs. If you happen to like dogs , this movie is also for you !There are some scenes which feel rushed and with that fail to make you experience emotions as the adventure goes. Certain choices are questionable but the movie still takes me to a happy place. For some this movie might be a good motive to escape our own comfort zone.What I especially like in this movie is its consistency with monsters and analysing things as the movie progresses so by the end we all evolve in some way.6.9/10

372,dylanrenner4,"Good, but what a terrible ending",7,15 February 2021,"This movie was good and it was fun to watch. I enjoyed spending the time to watch and laugh throughout the movie. The storyline and concept from the beginning is a little janky but you just role with it and believe it. Dylan O'Brien did a great job as always, I liked seeing him play this kind of dorky helpless character. But then to see his character arc grow into a strong and confident dude was really cool to see. I will say that the concept was good and literally until the last 30 minutes of the movie, I was loving it. As Aidan Bargman said ""They did a poor job wrapping it up."" The ending just seemed a bit rushed and forced. I think they could have come up with a better way to end the whole deal but it's whatever. The movie was shot right before covid, maybe even a bit during it, kinda unfortunate that it wasn't released in theaters. It was a fun movie to watch and I'd watch it again for sure. Just dang, that ending was just stupid.",Love and Monsters

380,lornak-18008,7.5 Stars Rounded Up! Enjoyable.,8,27 September 2021,"I enjoyed this apocalyptic movie and loved the main character- actually he's the reason I decided to watch. (He was a breakout star from Teen Wolf the series and he wasn't even a wolf.) His character is pretty scared of everything to the point that he's not allowed to leave his group's underground bunker to scavenge for food. The reason for the bunker is the monsters that roam the earth. They were changed by rocket chemical debris falling after a huge asteroid is broken up by said rockets. Admittedly, that was pretty farfetched, but hey it's a movie so I just went with it. He had a girlfriend 7 years before when the world changed and even though they got split up he decides to leave the bunker and go find her. Thus begins his quest and quite the adventure. He meets people along the way and there's so much action that happens that even the most jaded movie critic would probably enjoy it.Speaking of jaded critics-I read a lot of reviews after I watched and some of the reviews calling it bad are clearly written by people that didn't watch the whole thing. I saw so much erroneous info that if they had continued with the movie, they would have been proven wrong in some cases. Some people called it a movie for children. If that's what they really think, well then I think I'd have had nightmares after watching if I was a child. I think it's more for ages 13 and up, due to all the violence-depending on maturity level. There's humor as well and actually it's closer to a comedy/drama. I had a great time watching.",Love and Monsters

It sounded wacky, so I watched it - but it was a warm surprise - a story that everyday human can connect to, and that makes a good story for me - something that aims for your human emotions, and not your pockets or frustrations. If anyone from the production crew reads this by a 1 in a million chance: thank you kindly. True art, not just breasts, bicepses, killing and effects. Also: Boy <3",Love and Monsters

Interesting premise, pretty good creature cgi, a main character that becomes much more fleshed out as the movie progresses than he was at the beginning of the movie, lovely side characters and some pretty cool scenery. Straightforward plot with a few surprises and twists along the way, some cliches too. The acting and the screenplay were decent, nothing groundbreaking, but the movie is definitely worth a watch if you're bored!",Love and Monsters
386,tvedukr,"Its a fun thriller to watch, better than monster hunter",7,9 April 2021,"It takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where all of mankind has perished and Earth has been invaded by giant monsters. Love and Monsters isn't a completely original idea, but a clever script and Dylan O'Brien's charisma make for a fantastic adventure comedy.O'Brien plays Joel Dawson in Love and Monsters, a 24-year-old who has been living in a bunker underground with a group of fellow survivors since the 'Monsterpocalypse' seven years ago. When he hears his high school girlfriend Aimee (Jessica Henwick) on the radio, he decides on the spur of the moment to drive the 85 miles to her colony and reunite with his love. The problem is that Joel lacks both combat skills and killer instincts. That doesn't stop him, and happily, he meets a dog named Boy who keeps him safe, as well as a pair of survivors named Clyde (Michael Rooker) and Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt) who teach him how to stay alive.Joel is fighting monsters on the surface of the Earth, but he's still worried about whether he made the right decision to abandon his colony and meet Aimee, and it's unclear whether he'll survive the monsters - or his love.It's not often that you get to see a film in which even the weakest connection holds up. The dialogue is witty, the scenery is lovely yet fitting, the CGI game is good for the most part, and the cinematography is crisp and simple, with no lightning cuts or shaky camera.The entire cast was on point. Hero and Dog portrayed as ""Boy"" with such emotion, they were kind of long lost friends. Mavis the robot could almost pass the Turing exam. In a couple of scenes, you may have to suspend your disbelief a little. However, keep in mind that you're watching a film with giant frogs and snails, so it shouldn't be too difficult.",Love and Monsters
387,vaivhav,Like a modern refreshing version of Tremors,8,17 October 2020,Reminded me of the Tremor series from when I was a kid. But a very refreshing and modern take on the genre.

Turns out it was just a little adventure down a line of ""what if"" and exceptionally well done and just peeking in to someone's life for a little while well they go on a life changing adventure.When it was over all I wanted to do was watch more, so great job, can't wait for a sequel or series spin off.",Love and Monsters

I really wanted to dislike this film just because it looks like a big CGI fest from the trailer. To my surprise, Love and Monsters is more than that.
It is a journey about (in my point of view) overcoming a tragedy that defines you.Love is mostly just in the title, this is more of an emotional ride than a teen romantic comedy stuck in the apocalypse. Go watch it. ""You better.""",Love and Monsters

As soon as I saw that Dylan O'Brien was the lead I decided I'd give it a go, and it wasn't a mistake. O'Brien is in his wheelhouse here, playing on the likeable beta male sidekick role that made him a breakout in teen wolf. He brings humour and heart to a project that could have easily been a generic and forgettable affair, aided with some great supporting stints from the likes of Rooker and Greenblatt, however brief they might be.
Funny, warm and utterly charming. It's a family friendly Zombieland, without the expletives, the gore and...well, the Zombies. Well worth a watch if you're bored/down and in need of a good cheering up.",Love and Monsters

A fun and extremely well crafted monster movie with great (sometimes spectacular) CGI, great acting, and a stellar script. Perhaps the single best decision the creative minds behind this movie made was not making ""Boy"" the dog a CGI character.
Every single detail has been carefully considered from the storyline, character relationships, to the gorgeous Australian landscapes.
Simply put, this movie is about Love and Monsters, but taking the journey with Joel and Boy offers the viewer so much more.

However, the plot was very interesting and Dylan O'Brien is naturally a funny person so he is perfect for the role. Boy is also the perfect sidekick! I especially liked the first half of the movie when Joel heads out on his adventure and learn all the different life lessons etc. Although, I would prefer if they cut out the kissing scene in the end since it felt kind of cringey and cliché. Also, I for some reason find the title a bit trashy.. Other than that, I enjoyed the whole movie and had a very good time watching it!",Love and Monsters

412,malcolmwrites,Love and Monsters and Mediocrity,6,21 April 2021,"What can I say about Love and Monsters? It's got the comic-booky cheekiness of Zombieland, the trauma-filled travels of The Road, and the horrific, aliens-are-now-in-charge vibe of District 9. Plus, it's got a dog. There are some entertaining moments, a touch (but only a touch) of originality, and some fun times with mutated bugs.But the cliches are as abundant as the bugs: lots of near-misses, close calls, narrow escapes, blatant foreshadowing, a grungy guy (Michael Rooker) and a precocious girl (Ariana Greenblatt) shoehorned in, and a hero (Dylan O'Brien) who survives only by virtue of the fact that he has top billing. (Probably not the best casting choice, by the way. Joel, the main character, is supposed to be an emotionally traumatized milquetoast, but the actor is clearly a healthy, vigorous, athletic young man. A note to casting directors: why not a chubby kid? Or a scrawny kid. Or a kid with special physical or mental needs? Or a girl in search of her female soulmate? There are times when a healthy, young, square-jawed, White, heteronormative protagonist in the prime of his life is spot-on necessary and times when he just doesn't manage to sell the story.) The fact that the motivating love interest (Jessica Henwick) functions primarily as a prop to spur the hero on doesn't help.Which is to say that the film has its strong points and its weak ones. In the hands of a less inside-the-box writer and director, it could have been the next Daybreak. As it is, the movie's producers play it relatively safe, leaving us with a rather vanilla-fied end product with lots of twists and turns but with every one of them more predictable than the one before.I'll call this one 6 out of 10. Plus an extra half point for effort. I liked it okay, but I wouldn't watch it again, and I certainly wouldn't hail it as an exemplar of the genre.My advice to potential viewers? Sure. Go ahead and check it out. You'll have fun. Once in a while, you'll roll your eyes. You might glance over at your phone from time to time to see what else is happening in the world. But for close to seventy-five percent of the time, you'll have your eyes on the film. Its positives outweigh its negatives. Barely.",Love and Monsters

420,standsomething2,Great move. Teen Wolf fans should def give it a go.,8,28 November 2020,"This is a fantastic movie. It's got a lot to like. Humor, action, drama, creative monster creatures that would result from a mutating of all the cold blooded creatures on the planet, plot twists, the works. It's just an all around fun, feel good movie. Dylan O'Brien is awesome, as always, in the authenticity and likability he brings to the role. The thing that struck me about it, is that, for Teen Wolf fans, this movie is basically what would happen if Stiles Stilinski had to travel through a land of monsters trying to kill him in order to reach the girl he loves haha. O'Brien is basically playing Stiles, IN that setting, except his name is Joel. Name is different, but the personality and way he acts is on point Stiles haha And as expected, O'Brien kills it in that kind of role. He was one of the best things on Teen Wolf, and he's one of the best things about this movie. So if you were a fan of O'Brien as Stiles on Teen Wolf, I cannot see how you wouldn't like this movie. But even if you're not familiar with his work on Teen Wolf, you should definitely check this movie out.it doesn't disappoint. Definitely give it a watch.",Love and Monsters
421,curtismenne,A boy and his dog survive a world of monsters!,10,24 October 2020,"One of my now all time favorite films! It does a great job of keeping a consistent entertaining pace without dragging on drama or romance thankfully. It's action scenes are brief but fun while inspiring a sense of wonder with it's fun monsters. They crafted a world I want so desperately to learn more about! The creature design wasn't very fantastical and that is actually quite good as they are supposed to be mutated versions of Earth's flora and fauna. The movie is visually a treat to look at with some beautiful locales used for the movie that give you a true sense of exploration like any good adventure film should. I found the story to be quite heartwarming and not because of the romantic nature of the main story but the more important side story, a boy and his dog surviving the apocalypse.

436,nadijaherdwina,Would love to see a sequel!,9,25 April 2021,"At first, I have low expectations judging by the title. I'm not really into a monster movie, and the title is just too bland, unexciting. It turned out that it was a great movie that kept me excited once it started.It has cool monsters and the CGI was outstanding. Some parts of the storyline are predictable, but it still has a good twist. The acting was excellent, especially by Boy, the dog. He deserves an Oscar!I also adore Joel's character development, from an ordinary fearful man and ended up being a wise monster killer. I'm glad he decided to go back and help his colony.I'd love to see a sequel!",Love and Monsters

439,thehopefully,Overrated,4,18 April 2021,"I had high expectations, but unfortunately they were not met. Don't get me wrong, the visuals were one of the best I have seen. It still amazes me how realistically the monsters looked. The story line, however, isn't that good. Everything went so superfast. After seven years Joel wants to visit his 'girlfriend', which means he has to leave the bunker he has stayed in for years. Obviously, this will be a challenge because he is afraid of everything. While he is on his way he has to fight some monsters, and that's it basically. When he finally arrives he faces a bad guy, a typical storyline really.Spending more than 30 billion wasn't worth it in my opinion.",Love and Monsters

This movie initially impressed me with its minor details.Towards the end, aside from the promised, I did cherish several moments in the movie.The climax as such, was very different and much better than the usualCan't say the movie guarantees take aways for y'all, but I even the felt the whining of the dog.SPOILERS AHEAD1. Loved to have felt the attachment of the dog to its initial master
2. The genuine confusion it has while parting ways with the travellers/survivors.3. The girl having deeper commitments in life

No. Was it well made, directed and produced? Eh. Was it thoughtful or intriguing? Not really. But it had in spades what so many movies don't have anymore, fun. It was just an enjoyable, light, big hearted movie that you can watch over and over again. For what it was, it was genuinely refreshing in the slog of other Hulu and Netflix movies with a capable cast.",Love and Monsters

444,jstlucas,"Didn't expect much, was very glad it was way better than I expected.",8,9 November 2020,"Ok, I wanted to watch a cheesy movie while my wife was putting together a jigsaw puzzle. ""oh, this has monsters"" so it can't be too bad, maybe it'll be ok to watch. Well, the monsters were done well, the story is ok, and Joel (who has a tendency to freeze helplessly) is helped along by a couple of surface dwellers who teach him some of the tricks to stay alive. And he picks up a dog along the way. I'd recommend this to folks for an escape movie.",Love and Monsters
445,AGuyNamedJake,A Decent Family-Friendly Adventure Film With A Good Message for 2020,7,23 October 2020,"The most unexpected thing about ""Love and Monsters"" is how charmingly enjoyable it is throughout. Whether it's the well-fleshed out characters (the dog being the clear standout with probably the best arc in the whole movie), the fun monster slayings, or the amusing happenstance luck of the self-deprecating protagonist, there's not much left to hate in this otherwise simple movie.OBLIGATORY PLOT RECAP: A catastrophe mutates and enlarges all the bugs on Earth who then wipe out 95% of the human population. Seven years into the apocalypse, a hopelessly love-struck dork named Joel sets out across a dangerous Earth to reunite with the girl from his past.THE GOODEST STUFF: The pacing is tight, meaning there isn't a single scene that doesn't drive the story forward or develop the characters in some way. Nobody feels wasted, and the script gives you a real good sense of what each person is like, even if they're playing to somewhat of a stereotype (like the smart-mouthed 8-year-old survivalist girl whose all the amounts of plucky we've seen before, and yet still a scene-stealer.)And can I say how refreshing it is to see a post-apocalyptic movie like this where every human isn't a murdering bastard who is just out for his or herself? The humans in this movie are actually helpful to each other, you know, in the way that most humans are in emergency situations. Imagine that!Surprisingly, the movie pulls off several tonal shifts that are quick and well-executed. You'll be laughing one moment, terrified the next, and then almost in tears after certain flashbacks bare a character's soul in an unexpectedly touching way. It's the best kind of rollercoaster ride because it hits all the right emotional beats, even if, in the end, it does feel kind of small.Which is probably my biggest complaint...THE WORSTEST STUFF: ""Love and Monsters"" feels like it has a much bigger world to explore than the 80+ miles of terrain our hero journeys across. I mean, it's not like a ton more exposition is necessary, but the story alludes to other survivors out there and hints at an ending that we don't really get to see. Its story is essentially a VERY small piece of what looks like a much bigger puzzle. It's not enough to ruin the movie by any means, but the ""smallness"" is enhanced by a couple of hasty editing choices and a third act that feels a bit tacked-on when there is more interesting stuff to explore.CONCLUSION: ""Love and Monsters"" is sincere in its sweetness without being sickeningly so. It's got a great sense of humor, an extremely likable cast, and a fresh take on the post-apocalypse genre. It's the perfect feel-good movie for 2020 with a clear message that may or may not have been intentional: enough hiding; it's time to get out there and live your life.",Love and Monsters
446,tamingatche91,Gripping and Fun,8,20 April 2021,I came into this kinda blind. I knew nothing about the movie when I found it and just watched the 30 second snippet that Netflix shows you when you highlight a movie or show. It looked good so I gave it a go.This movie was so good and though it wasn't perfect you won't regret watching it. It's a love story at its core. Dylan O'Brien plays Joel. An awkward 20-something guy who's been living with a group of survivors in a colony. He's not brave and he owns that but he's always trying to prove himself anyway. Dylan was brilliant as Joel. His character growth is satisfying to watch but I won't say much more.The sidecast are all expertly acted but you don't really bond with the supporting characters and that's okay because this movie is about Joel's adventure. The people he meets add to the movie but don't outshine the main focus.My biggest gripe was the incredibly last minute with very little build up villain. I don't think we needed a human villain when there are literal monsters to fight. The movie starts by saying that the big ones were all wiped out but I felt having one be the big bad would have been better than what we got. Missed oppertunity.All in all 8/10. A fantastic journey.,Love and Monsters

450,simoneblue,Great Movie!!,8,11 November 2020,"With any monster movie, there are many tropes consistent with the genre. A real sign of a good monster movie is one that surpasses the norm, as well as keeps the tropes entertaining. This movie does just that. The plot is interesting, the scenarios are funny and exciting, and somehow this movie sends important messages and emotional scenes without and clunkiness in the storyline. It is by no means a classic, but I would absolutely watch it again. It is a great movie. There is only one question I want answered: WHERE THE HECK IS BOY'S DRESS?! This is something I desperately need to know!!!",Love and Monsters
451,mrwhoopsturtle,Fun movie in a Pandemic,9,10 January 2021,"Far from perfect but definitely a good starting point for future sequels. Elements of Zombieland, Mad Max and others movies. Main character is a little bit of a total wimp (see 2020 political correctness) but you know his heart is where it should be and you are definitely TEAM Dylan O'Brien. Great stuff from Michael Rooker (as always) and sets up for some really fun sequels. Yes there is even an actor from the Mad Max series in it to make it awesome for an old movie buff like me. There is still LOVE for Apocalypse movies in the 2020-21 pandemic.",Love and Monsters

I'd prefer the usual culprit - the alien bacteria or virus..I imagine a scene in the beginning of the movie, where hero and his girlfriend are watching a documentary about insects actually being meters big already in Earth's history eons ago. That would make the plot more convincing, as we all can agree some bugs look hideous.Teenagers won't mind, as movie is quick and entertaining enough.",Love and Monsters

459,Neindude,"Humorless, non-stop yammering... The dog was good though",3,18 October 2020,"The protagonist just won't shut up. Cringeworthy dialogue delivery. All attempts at humor fail, unoriginal story, boring. You can tell you've seen characters like that in other movies, except the dog.CGI was just good enough but the monsters were terribly underused. The events build up the tension, but they are quickly resolved without any effort, so no real moment of rejoice throughout the movie. They even tried to spice up the story by introducing a villain in the last half hour. Nothing special happens though.Better see something else, unless you are easily amused by generic teen-ish acting, bland characters and a plain story with couple of nice moments here and there. The dog was the only likeable character.",Love and Monsters

All the time the third rate version of Jesse Eisenberg yammers endlessly with no charm or redeeming qualities.After an idiotic idea to cross the wasteland facing certain death to meet his girlfriend, we meet Michael Rooker pretendsingto be Woody Harrelson.And you shut it off, realizing that you don't want to waste any more of your life on this.",Love and Monsters

464,dashx-84958,"A great start that felt Creative and refined, but ended cartoonish and lazy and predictable , worst yet: Nothing bad ever happens)",6,27 October 2020,"I hate when I can see shortcuts in movies, things that happened in a movie because the budget couldn't justify doing something else. That's often how I feel while watching Monster Problems.It starts out really great, we have this awkward wimpy main character growing through an adventure to become a role model to others.But many parts of the films ending just feel thoughtless and unrealistic or lower budget compared to prior scenes.There are alot of great characters in this but it just made me want to see more of them, I feel like this would have done better as a series than a movie. There was alot of content to explore and it feels cut short.It would have been much more fun to watch this instead of the borefest that is the walking dead series. This is a super creative story and the art and style, concepts, sound, character designs was fantastic, but the ""progression just felt like it had great moments, but it was a ""too good to be true"" feel to it.I guess that's the part where it feels like it was make believe or perhaps made for children because nothing bad ever happens in a world where it seems like it does everyday but we didn't get to see it.The beginning was great realistic, believable, but it ended like a fairy tale, a journey without a feeling of any struggle sort of like wow you made it and nothing happened except you had a few moments but never failed, when before it seemed like you failed everything.",Love and Monsters

I watched it with my nephew who at first balked and it pulled him in. The special effects are well-done and pretty solid. The story moves at a good clip and the characters are relatable and you like them. Just regular people just trying to survive.

And that has to mean something in an entertainment business where everything today is about target groups, special effects, diversity and political correctness. It's nice to watch a movie from time to time that just wants to achieve one thing - to entertain. Here is where this one delivers. It hasn't the most elaborate plot and isn't very innovative either, but it cares for its characters and does them justice.

If the fallout from rockets effected the DNA of all animals, why didn't humans and animals like ""Boy"" (the dog) change? And Aimee what the hell!.. You didn't even look at his face properly.

The character what he plays!) The plot armor was way too powerful around him...With his abilities no way to survive more than 2 days in this kind of environment (aiming at -100%, dexterity is below average...plus big psychological issues makes him unable to fight..)

481,pettyperez,5 Stars for Dylan O'Brien and the Dog,5,1 May 2021,"""Love and Monsters"" has some good special effects, a little bit of thrill and a few genuinely funny jokes. And that's about it.Overall it felt too childish as Joel, the protagonist, is supposedly 24 years old, but it seems that his head got stuck in his 17 year old self due to the apocalypse. I like the funny/clumsy kind of character, but they overdid it to the point where as a viewer I just rolled my eyes and thought ""get a grip"" during some scenes.Dylan O'Brien did a really good job with such a poorly written character. His performance and the dog were worth watching the movie.",Love and Monsters

I really hope they make a sequel!",Love and Monsters
483,Anatolie,"Funny, intersting and relax movie with great actors and cute dog.",7,10 November 2020,"""Love and Monsters"" - a film that I liked surprisingly. I really liked the world of the apocalypse, all the monsters turned out to be very interesting and quite frightening (it's a pity that there was no huge spider, I would have looked). The graphics and visuals of the monsters were good too. All the characters turned out to be charismatic, except for the villain, who seemed clichéd and silly to me. In addition, the amazing actors Michael Rooker (Clyde) and Ariana Greenblatt (Minnow) were very cool here, and Dylan O'Brien (Joel) surprised me, he played his role very well, I really liked him. The film is very funny, sometimes even sad. For what you can blame this film, it is a bit banal and predictable plot, but it does not interfere with watching the movie. If you just want to relax in the evening and watch a movie, this will do, I advise you to watch it once.",Love and Monsters

But this movie did not know what it wanted to be. Comedy? Looked like it, but then tried to be serious towards the second part. Romantic? Not much romance going on. Adventure/action? There were parts when this was completely missing. Family movie with monsters? Yeah, sounds about right.I was annoyed with Joel for about 55 mins, which is a long time for the main protagonist. He was just...awful :D Minnow and the other guy appeared for a very short time in my opinion, not enough was explained about the world, the ending was too much of a cliche.But overall,I kinda liked it,as something to have on the TV when I could not choose anything else.

498,Dr_Kalai,Okish movie for 12 yr old kids,5,17 October 2020,This movie is aimed at kids and teens. I'm neither. But the story is boring and predictable. Some of the monsters looked realistic whereas few are bad CGIs. The story rides on the lead character's supposedly innocent and charismatic looks. But the lead character is only innocent. The finale is the dumbest thing I've seen in a while. And I'm pretty sure now the movie's world population will drop from 5% to 0.5%.,Love and Monsters

It's really unique and has a lot of laughs and Dylan O Brian is Incredible as per usual. Ever since I saw him in the Maze runner series he's just gotten better and better he truly is a gifted and versatile actor! This movie is a MUST WATCH 10/10!

Like your old uncle telling an unlaughable joke and you feel embarassed.On the horror side, the dangers to be outside, implied by all the charachters is never really felt.Instead, you follow.a boy on a kind of field trip. Nice landscape but somewhat boring.Most of scenes are just cliches :
Unskilled character becoming the jack of all trades : doneThe lost love that doesn""t love you anymore but in the end, yes indeed : checkThe mentor who ignroes you but finally teaches you how to survive : checkThe handsome guy who is finally a villain : checkThe monsters have to be gooey with lots of legs or tentacles : doneetc....etc...Actually, I would say this is more an afetrnoon telefilm for 8-12 yeras old.So, not a bad film but not a good one too.",Love and Monsters

503,jalalanajjar,"10/10 for the dog ""Boy""",10,16 October 2020,"If they killed the dog in this movie I would've given it 1/10, the hero is the dog..
The story could've been better, but it's not bad.. they could've expanded it more and gave more time for the journey with the kid and the man who taught him things, it should've been like a year journey where he becomes really a bad ass, and the plot with the yacht captain was dull, very interesting premise and could've been much much better.. loveable characters I'd love if this was a series maybe?
anyways very entertaining but lacks a bit of darkness which should go with every apocalypse movie.
That being said, there is something else about this movie that makes it relatable for the time we live in, as we are becoming more and more afraid to go out, we spend our time cooking and around electronics.. the message here is to go out and enjoy our beautiful world.. make friends (not online) and be more out there and gain skills that we don't know we had in us.",Love and Monsters

515,rroncevic,To the naysayers...,10,5 January 2021,"Truly a great movie! Hits you on every emotional level, aside from thriller or horror in the sense I never jumped out of my seat or was truly scared.I have seen a few negative reviews and one such said this was a boring movie. I would hate to be in that reviewers life, as I'm not sure what could excite them.Another reviewer mentioned that this is a teenager movie... VERY VERY VERY MINOR SPOILER ALERT COMING. As a hater of spoilers I don't actually find this as one. I'm that guy who doesn't even read movie descriptions or watch trailers, as they so often have hidden spoilers (sometimes quite large, as seeing an arm dressed in pink polka dots shooting somebody. That's when I'm pissed off the moment I see a person dressed in pink polka dots).As for my VERY MINOR SPOILERThere is not one damn teenager in this movie. The main characters are in there mid 20's and the rest are clearly above, aside from a baby, which is seen amongst the first scenes, and a girl no more than 10 years of age I'd guess. My thoughts on that reviewer is that they find monsters and such childish.This was a very clever way to bring monsters into a movie, my own opinion.CGI was actually great (especially considering they didn't have a huge budget) and I'm not a fan of the CGI in many motion pictures.It's a movie that will actually give you insight on how you may want to live your life.Face your fears and see the world... or even face the world and see your fears.Shame on these 1 star reviewers. I rate 10's too often because I can see the good in a lot of movies. You'll probably never see me rate a 1. For this movie to have as great of imagery and acting (even if only one actor stole the show, which is not the case in my eyes) it's already above 3 stars to me.Sorry for my rant, but I can't stand people who literally cannot appreciate a single aspect of something, whether movie or otherwise.

519,pausebreak,Thank you for an awesome experience!,8,24 January 2021,"Haven't reviewed a movie in a long time (from what I remember), but I am here to thank the people behind this for a wonderful time my family and I had. I kept putting off watching this movie since we already missed it last Halloween and I wasn't in a hurry to check out a mildly interesting title. But I'm glad we finally watched it last weekend and all throughout we just kept saying ""this seems like a good movie."" And it is! Only somewhat negative comment would be the appearance of creatures that are a bit out of place, but considering the premise (and the ride that this movie is!), it's easy to forgive.Highly enjoyable family movie. My youngest kid even said he liked the characters for not being stupid (as far as ""horror"" movies go). It's really refreshing, and the lesson in the end isn't something you've heard a thousand times. (Maybe less than a hundred at most!) ;) I can't compare this with any other film, but at least for the flavor, I'd put this up there with the MIB movies and maybe Ghostbusters.

525,lquinlan-17636,"A fun, light hearted movie",8,4 September 2021,"Listen, if you are looking for a horror movie, seek out another movie immediately. This is a PG-13 movie leaning more towards PG. It's a fun, not really scary movie that younger kids can watch. It's one of those coming of age movies where the main character finds his true potential in a post apocalyptic world where amphibians, crustaceans & insects turn into much larger (and some of them nice) versions of what we know now. Love is the first word in the movie title for a reason and I actually really like the world that's created- think more Labrynth/Princess Bride forrest than Zombieland. The worlds in the aforementioned are probably scarier than what they show in Love & Monsters. It's a fun fluff movie that I really actually enjoyed more than I expected. If you liked Warm Bodies, you may like this too. I will definitely watch this again. It's a fun movie.Also, Michael Rooker and a young girl pop up in this.

The starting idea is very good but it would need some improvements and changes here and there to make this ""road movie"" a little less obvious. Honorable mention goes to special effects supervisors Matt Sloan and Steve Boyle who have accomplished an optical job making it the Oscar-nominated film in the aforementioned category.",Love and Monsters

The film touches on aspects of romance/love, aspects of adventuring, and aspects of surviving in a somewhat apocalyptic world.

Good story and something slightly different for a change.My only question was, if the entire world went into hiding, why weren't the so many monsters when he traveled to go find Aimee? Seems like the whole world purposely went into hiding coz the amount of monsters he encountered didn't seem like much. Lol.",Love and Monsters
549,brandondaniels-89236,Hmm..I like it but..,7,26 September 2021,Movie has flaws. Story is really meh but continues to engage through the journey itself. The Monsters in this movie are very interesting easily the best part of the movie. Some designs are just plain simple and others are very elaborate. Some actors are great and other are just annoying. Michael Rooker is easily the best part of this movie with his little sidekick. It's odd that I'm more interested in the side characters then the protagonist. The Dog feels even more interesting then him.. Though most characters develop over the story so he becomes more tolerable. Of the concepts in the movie I wish they would of focused little bit more on the side of the Robots like Mavis. Movie has almost two hours you coulda told their side of the story little more that isn't shown. It just seems odd they have such high technology in the movie without it being more explored. Overall it's in the middle without any spoilers. Worth a watch if it's available.,Love and Monsters

I figured it would just be another movie heavily reliant on CG with no plot or character development. As it turned out the movie has quite relatable and endearing characters, the special effects and action are pretty fun and there is enough of a story to carry this film. I would seriously consider checking out this movie if you are on the fence, it's not going to win any awards and there probably won't be a sequel but it is a dam good watch.

Highly recommend it as a family movie.",Love and Monsters
556,willx-robinson,Awesome feel-good film where the lead is never more than a normal guy,10,10 September 2021,"A rare gem, inline with my all-time favourite 'Stardust' - both of which follow a general nobody on a Fool's Errand for true love, although through very differing circumstances...Dylan O'Brien is amazing as the lead who's lost everything and gained next-to nothing. He's loved by his colony despite being a nobody since he makes great minestrone.It's refreshing that he's never made out to be more than he is - just a guy trying to survive - and even when he's called upon to be the hero he's still the same guy, just using what he's learned on the journey.It's always great seeing Michael Rooker playing a good guy, and he does it flawlessly - the old mentor teaching the new guy what he knows, it's just a shame we don't see more of him as he's incredibly likeable.Ariana Greenblatt is awesome as Minnow, the child who's lost everyone she knows and partners along with Rooker, first thinking O'Brien is useless but growing to respect and care about him.Boy (the dog who's lost his owner) is on par with O'Brien, not stealing the show, but playing the faithful companion with utmost diligence (mostly).All in all, the writing is top notch, the effects are mostly impeccable (only failing in the odd scene where CGI meets close-ups), it's well worth the watch, and I highly recommend it as an awesome feel-good film!",Love and Monsters

But nowadays my litmus test for a good sci fi romance is the ability for the movie to make me cry. That didn't happen with this one.",Love and Monsters

568,steve-case,An unexpected delight,9,20 September 2021,"I was expecting some kind of silly monster horror comedy. Nope, this was a post apocalyptic coming-of-age story.

570,aniketdabetwar,All time favorite,10,21 October 2020,It's my all time favorite movie. It's so good. They have depicted monsters in a very good way and all the characters have played their roles perfectly. And of course Dylan O'Brian is the best of all of them.,Love and Monsters
571,landminer,Feel good post apocalypse adventure,8,5 June 2021,This is a light hearted post apocalyptic adventure movie. Takes on a different (to some extent an even more interesting) route than the usual humans turning into zombies movies.The only thing that I found a bit off was the lack of potential in the monsters to wipe off 95% of the world. I mean they were scary and dangerous but not really something the military shouldn't be able to handle. Then was the fact that the protagonist was able to survive from these monsters without any prior experience with them.Still the movie has enough going on most of the time to be engaging. It's a post apocalyptic fantasy and kinda feel good movie that's worth a watch.,Love and Monsters

575,catamella,Just what I needed,8,24 April 2021,"This is the kind of movie I had been waiting for.

I loved it :)",Love and Monsters
576,dalyaurku,Meh,5,2 May 2021,"I guess they didn't think about the story too much, they just loved the idea and made it a movie. I can't suggest this movie to my family and friends because everything is so predictable, and the dialogs weren't good.",Love and Monsters

A usual storyline in an unusual world that gives a wonderful message in the end. It conveys that love remains intact in a world where humanity is still clinging for its survival. Its not about the love between two protogonists but his love for all the things like dog, strangers in a bunker and all that's left in it.

584,Nadia5852x,"Watch this movie for enjoyment, not the plot.",7,14 April 2021,"This movie came today on Netflix in the Netherlands and I've watched immeditaly.I am going to put this rating in sections.Story: 7
It is about a boy who is living 7 years in a bunker and he is going to walk 85 miles to get to his girlfriend. It is a funny story with a simple plot. I love the main character because he has a character development and ofcourse Dylan O'Brien is a very good actor.Sound: 8
Most of the time it was very tensive because everytime something dangerous is going to happen, it gets silent and then when the action is coming, the music gets very tense. It feels like you have to run too.Characters: 7
Dylan has a good main character. The character has a background and something to look forward to. For others I personally think they deserve better writing but it is fine.Enjoyment: 7
It is a good movie and I do recommend this to others but it is not my favorite and also not the best movie I've seen. It is a fun, exciting and intresting movie.Overall I give this movie a 7/10.",Love and Monsters

But I was pleasantly surprised by a overall enjoyable movie with fantastic special effects.One of the reasons I couldn´t rate it higher is because there is just so much more that could have been done with the story. Don´t get me wrong I am not judging the movie for what it isn´t. It´s just that in relation to the amazing effects and interesting characters-monsters and fantastic setting the story is a fairly mundane, straight forward affair.Here´s to hoping that a sequel will be green lit.",Love and Monsters

This was an end of the world story as anticipated but what I didn't expect was how funny, weird and brilliantly different the story would be. The beginning starts off as more of a comedy and then you become invested in the characters journey. It was really enjoyable to watch, the monsters are so unique and the dog is just beautiful. A must watch.",Love and Monsters

595,ghettopato,Really enjoyable,9,17 October 2020,"You won't find anything here that you don't see in other movies of the genre, most of the movie is a remix of already established tropes. But it is a great remix thereof. The actor of the main character especially does a really great job to portray the sometimes absurd story in the most believable way possible. This movie is a lot of fun to watch and a perfect homage to the 1975 film 'A Boy and His Dog'.",Love and Monsters

The lead was annoying and whiny and didn't deserve to survive five minutes in that post apocalyptic hellscape. I did feel bad for the giant crab though. All in all a tired and trope ridden monster movie.",Love and Monsters
599,rolyboya,Sunday afternoon delight.,7,24 April 2021,"Not bad!Love and Monsters isn't your typical apocalypse movies with zombies. It's a rather wholesome film that's great to watch on a Sunday afternoon when you just want to relax on the couch.There's just one thing that bothered me, and it's a major thing.Spoilers below -The ending was awful! He kissed her goodbye and went back to his colony without a single obstacle, fight, or encounter? And where is everyone supposed to go when they leave their colonies?!There is no way of making a smooth transition from this movie to a sequel.",Love and Monsters
600,jossanlindgren,Enjoyed it alot! Hoping for a sequel,9,17 April 2021,"I feel like second movie would be great. We didn't see as many monsters as I'd hoped.

602,josheelkumar,As good as it gets,8,16 October 2020,"This movie was very fun to watch, after so long time I felt I was watching something good.
While I'm a fan of many of the headlining actors, the premise sounded a little goofy and I worried it would be a bit B-movie-esque. It was actually very well done and so much fun from start to finish. O'Brien does a wonderful job making Joel both believable and relatable. His character Joel indeed begins as a loveable, pathetic, little hedgehog and it's a fun ride watching him come of age and find himself. The premise behind the monsters is neat, the romance was well done, all in all, it was just an incredible movie.",Love and Monsters
603,antoniabawden,Similar plot to kipo and the wonderful beasts,7,25 April 2021,"The film has the same premise as an animated show called kipo and the wonderful beasts. I was surprised that it was so similar in that there are mutated animals, and the lead leaves a bunker to find a loved one while on the way to finding two strangers and a pet.So I'm starting to think it's a cliche for post Apocalypse films. This was a good film for a Sunday evening with the family, is a very cute dog and likeable characters. Otherwise the film may be forgettable as it follows similar plots to other movies.",Love and Monsters
604,martin-krh,Quite entertaining.,7,26 April 2021,"I enjoyed this movie that somehow reminded me of Zombieland, just not quite as good. It's a fun film with some well made monsters and has simple plot so take it for what it is; good entertainment.",Love and Monsters

606,sabbyd-91084,you watched this bc dylan was in it,7,21 August 2021,I reckon this was like a solid 6.5. It was actually quite humorous I was chuckling a bit but mostly because of how weird some of tolerable it was. This is for dylan o'brien fans- i kind of went in assuming it was action (it was categorised as sci-fi under netflix ??) it's a great mindless-kinda movie for if you want something w drive and a decent sense of humour (my kind of humour exclusively contained scenes w the creepy mav1s robot). Points for including an aussie... but not as many as you just lost for making him evil (classic),Love and Monsters
607,jdprdise-95368,Best movie of the year!,9,24 October 2020,"I didn't have very high expectations but this movie was amazing. No politics involved just a straight feel good, fun story! Cannot wait for the 2nd one to come out. This is the movie I needed right now.",Love and Monsters

The director of this movie truly reminded Hollywood of the important responsibility of taking care of each other like family, including their actors and all the supporting people in films to not let them go too far.It's a great reminder that can be used in response to the negligent acts of people in authority like directors abusing their ethical duty to protect the ones that entrust their lives to them.Sometimes the unintentional results of a rogue actor/actress trying to prove themself can hurt themselves and those with them as well. Kudo's to Dir. Michal Matthews for carrying everyone to the finish line and also while teaching a valuable lesson to a very good and dedicated young man.And Kudos to Dylan O'Brien for stepping up to do the right thing for his fellow actors and supporting people for his role. He is doing a hell of a job of acting! I see great things from him in the future!Watch and decide for yourself. Great movie! Great Morals. Good Job!",Love and Monsters

I then read some reviews on here of people ripping into it but I always like to decide for myself.After watching it I can honestly say ""Some people have forgotten how to have fun"".We live in such a jaded world where some people cannot just sit back and enjoy a fun adventure movie anymore.Is the movie cliche? Yes!
Is it predictable? Yes!
Do you see enough of the monsters? Yes actually (some people have said otherwise, I don't know what film they were watching)But is the film fun? Yes it is!Its not going to win any awards but the film takes you along on Joel's fun and sometimes tense journey with a pooch called Boy (as well as some other characters along the way).Stop being so jaded people, learn to have some fun again. Watch Love and Monsters.",Love and Monsters
614,olavhg,"Funny and adventures with great SFX, but not amazing",6,24 May 2021,"This movie is a kids movie. The plot, the ending and how the movie is built is like a kids movie. That said, it was very enjoyable. The movie had a cool concept and great special effects.I say this is a kids movie, but there are some scenes kids shouldn't see. If they wanted to make a movie for older audiences they should have made it darker and less funny. If they wanted to make a more lighthearted movie they should have made it without the gore scene in the begining. It seemed like they really didn't know who to make the movie for. It was a bit to gullible for my taste, but it is a bit to gory for a ten-twelve year old.The movie is worth a watch regardless of who you are. Like I said, it's not amazing, but I enjoyed myself while watching it.",Love and Monsters
615,reyizain,A Perfectly Good Watch For All The Family,8,18 October 2020,"This film will not change film history, it will not be remembered for having a stunning plot or being clever in some other way acceptable to the penalizing critics BUT it's fun and a great escape. It provides the right balance of hope, comedy, action, romance and 'buddiness' for the whole family to get something out of it. We thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend that you skip the over critical reviews and just make up your own mind. Would I have done certain things different? Yes, but so what? The film is a perfectly good watch for all the family!",Love and Monsters

617,bladedk-17904,Suprisingly good,8,15 April 2021,"Love and monsters is actually a really solid movie.It reminds me of Zombieland, just with giant insect monsters instead of zombies and not quite as good imo.Yes, theres a lot of things that doesn't really make sense, but it's enjoyable.It's a fun comedy adventure, with great CGI, that i could see become a small franchise.Dylan does a good job, and so does all the other actors.Characters are all interesting enough. Most of the movie is about Joel alone, but this leaves open a lot of character development for the rest of the cast in (hopefully) future sequels. The best character was Boy, of course.Would highly recommend if you like these types of movies!",Love and Monsters
618,frostyde,Romance isnt dead,10,14 April 2021,"I really liked this film.A coming of age romance set in a monster dystopia.The monsters arent bad!The CGI and imagination that went into the monsters of this was superb. I enjoy the creativity that the designers employed when creating these monsters. Although some of them maybe rip offs of our household Harry Potter and Lord of the Ring favourites; perhaps some Spiderwick Chronicles for good measure. These monsters are by no means less of a favorite in this film as they are rendered beautifully.Coming of age?The story is a solid coming of age romance. Following the journey of one teen boy turned young adult as he is thrown into a world to make his way to of course, romantically sweep a girl off their feet. The story works and is cute enough for you and your girlfriend to watch.",Love and Monsters

Falling firmly into a plot that if managed badly could've been so utterly painful, this film handles a classic theme so well and ,despite ringing each trope bell as it passes, managed to feel fresh and alive!

624,sainapradhan,Good Formulaic Apocalypse Adventure.,8,1 December 2020,"There's something intrinsically good about these kinds of movies that it almost always works. If done right, movies like these are entertaining, easy to watch, somehow nostalgic and formulaic in a way that it doesn't make it boring but easy to digest and fun. This movie is one of those movies.
The plot is done a million times honestly, Dylan O'Brien reminds of Thomas from Maze Runner and I liked him in this movie too. All in all, this was fun and a great movie to watch with family, friends or alone when your day has sucked and you want something fun to watch. I've said 'fun' a lot of times by now but that's honestly one of the only words I could use to describe this movie. The CG is not bad but it's not great either. The acting is fairly decent. Bonus points for the dog, Boy. Obviously, the climax was cheesy and a very Disney-esque reveal but I liked the callback aspect of it. The world-building was good and the premise was something that has obviously been done before. I had not watched the trailer, so at first I thought it was going to be an alien apocalypse movie. But giant mutated cold-blooded animals. Nice. it was pretty wholesome if I could say so myself. There's an apocalypse, a wide-eyed cowardly protagonist, likeable tag-along side characters, an adorable dog, love at the heart of the movie and a fairly decent soundtrack. So watch it. You will not be disappointed.",Love and Monsters
625,fschafe,Feel Good Movie,10,4 September 2021,"I am not a fan of horror movies, and I only watched this movie cause I read that there were not many monsters in it.What a lovely movie it is!

This is a Maze-Runner meets Jumanji meets Zombieland type of film. Also the dog. My god. He is not only a good Boy, but he's also a better actor than those who we see as main leads in a lot of netflix productions. Although the story is quite resolved in the end, I feel like a sequel would be a nice addition, just to clear up some plots like who is the actual owner of Boy and is she a potential love interest for our boy? What happens when they reach the mountains? Definitely an enjoyable and satisfying film.",Love and Monsters
627,danieljjclifford,Decent Effects with a semi-engaging plot.,6,18 April 2021,"Has been said before, but if you do not overly analyse the plot holes, this serves as a very solid once off film. The cast are fine. The acting is passable, but the monsters shine. The effects are brilliant.One thing that annoyed me was, when the dog runs off. Our main hero just casually accepts this. Moves on. And goes on his way. Never really tries to go after him, or is sad. The dog is literally his best friend for 3/4 of the movie.",Love and Monsters

It's what great entertainment is all about.This is steeped with Director Michael Matthews having dove deep into the script and made each character come alive in the actors.

634,zantertaylor,A happy ride 😁,8,22 October 2020,"This is one of the best movies I've seen all year.
Hints of Star Ship Troopers and a Zombie Land vibe, come together to make a disaster movie not so doom and gloom.
I can see a grabbing hole that could have been filled and put the icing on the cake it involves a certain red dress and a dog and the potential of a new love interest, but as in life just like the movies you can't have it all.
The cast all do great jobs Michael Rooker and the wee girl have a Big Daddy and Hit Girl type relationship which works really well.
The CGI monsters aren't going to blow anyone's mind but they're enjoyable. The movie's a fun ride with plenty of frills and emotion, one scene in particular strikes such a balance of beauty, emotion and sadness all backed by the song ""Stand by me"".
You feel for the main character as he goes on his journey and grows as the film progresses nothing's rushed and he doesn't go from zero to hero montage style in 5mins.
Some times all it takes is a little luck a grenade and 5 secs 😁.",Love and Monsters
635,jgalvez2002,This was a surprisingly good movie!,9,17 April 2021,"I usually have low expectations for Netflix movies especially Young Adult movies but this was one had great visual effects, which I can see has been nominated for an Oscar. But what drew me to keep watching was Dylan O'Brien's performance. I can tell he learned alot from his mother's acting technique and really carried the movie. It's a really good feel-good movie, entertaining and humorous bits. Nice job!",Love and Monsters
636,virgonoshaka,An unexpected delight,9,21 October 2020,"This movie felt like a really good surprise, the quest is simple and very well structured, making it agreably easy and fun to tag along as this young dude makes his way through a hostile world, meeting interesting and challenging people.
The character arc of the protagonist is very enjoyable, although the runtime is under 1h40.
The not Marvel grade digital effects give ""Monster Problems"" a B-Movie quality that makes it kind of even cooler, because it shows that the production had its heart in the right place and spent the money on quality actors, light, sound and of course story.
I give this movie a very well deserved 9 stars for the excellent unexpected surprise it delivers as a whole.",Love and Monsters

638,Rupucii,Fresh and adventurous view on a post-apocalyptic environment,7,17 October 2020,"Apocalyptic films are nothing new, but the view of ""Love and Monsters"" on this genre is a little more lighthearted and with a bit of humor. Directed by Michael Matthews, the film is based in a post-apocalyptic world where most of humanity has died and the world has been overtaken by giant creatures.This film reminded me a little bit of The Maze Runner, and not just because Dylan O'Brien is in the main role, but also that the main character knows little about an quite dangerous environment in which he is, that he is fearful and, it must be said, he is running everywhere. It seems that these running fragments were even filmed in a rather similar manner. ""Love and Monster"" isn't with a very fresh concept, but the script and the charm of Dylan O'Brien make it a rather fun adventure comedy.Sometimes the environment was rather peaceful, even too peaceful, given that there should have been all sorts of creatures around everywhere. But in the end, this was comedy and the overall script was pretty good. So I will say that the film certainly deserves at least 7.Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien) is 24 years old and lives in an underground bunker with the group of survivors for the past seven years. When he restores contacts with his high-school girlfriend Aimee (Jessica Henwick) over the radio, he makes a spontaneous decision to go to her colony, located 85 miles (~137 km) away, to meet his love again. It would be easy if Joel understood anything from survival outside the bunker, but it certainly doesn't stop him from going. And then the adventure begins.During Joel's journey, the environment is displayed in great expanses, many forests and mountains. Urban environments have been well overgrown (I think a bit too much for seven years). At the same time, the various creatures he encounters along the way have also been shown fairly well.When it comes to acting, it seemed mostly good, especially where Joel spoke to the dog he met as with a real person and expressed himself in a monologue, as well as in a conversation with Mavis (""MAV1S""), where his emotions were very well represented. The music didn't stand out anywhere, though I liked the moment where Mavis played her final piece of music.In general, I would suggest that you do not go into the little details and don't think so much about those dangers of apocalypse, but simply enjoy it. The film shows this all from a different point of view and the main thing you have to remember is that it's an adventure comedy anyway. Enjoy!",Love and Monsters
639,mulstayrob24,Came out of left field,9,7 October 2021,"This was great. Went in with low expectations and was completely surprised by how well made this film is. People giving really low ratings were probably looking for another apocalyptic bloodbath or something. These folks made a hart warming story in a post apocalyptic landscape that doesn't involve zombies, so good on them. Great little action scenes, short but meaningful relationship building between characters, the dog is amazing, and it gives you some twists with a dash of humor. I really hope they make a sequel.",Love and Monsters

Surely a true masterpiece like Shawshank Redemption or Inception should be getting that kind of rating.. not a film that's mediocre like this. I feel like they were trying to go for a Zombieland vibe, but Zombieland is on a completely other level with great humour and character development, this film has awful humour and doesn't make you feel any emotion towards the characters, the only character I was rooting for was the dog! Basically it's just an easy watch, ok for a Sunday afternoon or just as something to sling on when you can't find anything decent to put on. I'm not saying it's awful, I'm just saying it's not great, it's nothing special, it's just... ok.",Love and Monsters

647,felixthecatsmeow,Bright colours and right on time,8,17 April 2021,"I reckon I like this so much because life has been so drab for the last year and a half. I reckon it's probably because there's been nothing new and fresh. Probably as well because it's main message is that you leave where you've been hiding and there is a wide, bright, good and bad world out there.Sit on your hands and nothing changes. Pain and loss is horrible and it changes you. I am terrified of change. The last few months especially though have taught me the power of change. I reckon if you're cold in winter, it's that much warmer in summer. If the autumn makes you wet through then the dry earth is another degree of special.This film is beautiful colours, identifiable characters, right and wrong. And right and wrong in shades of grey.It's a good journey and it is definitely of it's time. Whether it will age I'm not sure but pretty happy watching it now.

A beautiful, meaningful script laced with moments of true hilarity and filled with rich, interesting characters. A director that gets wonderful, nuanced performances from the excellent actors, and who makes perfect shot choices (with the help of a very talented cinematographer). An editor who puts it seamlessly together, heightening the action and adding lots of extra humor with brilliant timing and great cutaways. And the special effects... I have not seen a better monster movie for effects. Unbelievable. To top it off, the sound is clear and crisp, could not have been improved upon. This is one finely crafted film, and to top it off, it left me feeling so happy. Such sweet, universal messages of love and courage. A true delight.",Love and Monsters

I went into it with little to no expectations and was shocked by just how good I found it. Enough to be added to my list of favorites for sure. The main character - thank god - is actually likeable, unlike so many protagonists before. The romance, despite being integral to the plot, isn't forced or overwhelming. The characters actually respond to traumatic events accordingly instead of brushing it all off like nothing happened (perhaps it could have been done a little better but at the end of the day it's a rather light movie). And perhaps most importantly - it's chock full of super cool monsters, with an adorable canine companion as the cherry on top. Definitely check this out if you get the chance! Warning though: it might be a bit more emotional than you expect (I teared up a bit at one scene, LOL).",Love and Monsters

So amazing, so much depth and all characters are well thought out. No dull moments, and dylan o'brien's character is very easy to relate to. Weirdly empowering, and very satisfying ending.

673,John-Derat,Good movie. Solid 8/10,8,12 July 2021,"I definitely enjoyed the movie, I found a few moments a bit cliché, and which are always present in PG-13 movies. The plot armor was also a bit mind-boggling at times, but I think it was still a good movie.I like the protagonist, he's not a Will Smith or some survival expert, he's a relatable young guy who stupidly goes on a quest for love, without even really thinking about it. But what makes it good is that he realizes this at the end, ""Why did I do this?"", he realizes it was so dumb, but even if it was indeed stupid, he doesn't regret doing it. It allowed him to find himself, be who he wanted to be.I really liked the moments of panic, they were pretty realistic. Like when Joel has plenty of leeches on him, how he panics a bit at first, then when he realizes they're all over him, he just goes full panic mode, I think it was funny, neat, and realistic. The ""fight"" scene where he fights the giant centipede is also great, how he freezes, gets knocked back, while centipede traps the dog, getting ready to kill him, it was so intense. Then we see a flashback of Joel's family and how they died, which instantly gives purpose to that monster, instead of being just dumb CGI monster which gives the no reasons for the audience to care about, it turns into the embodiment of Joel's pain, that centipede isn't the insect which killed his family, but it might as well be, because it's the same situation all over again, except this time, instead of his family, it's his dog. Very well done. The other scene against the queen sand gobbler or whatever it's called, was also very nice. How Joel and the dog are hiding in a tree trunk, and Joel had to force the dog's mouth closed, it was stressing and a bit hard to watch, a good scene overall. And for the final monster, which was the crab, at first i wasn't impressed at all, but it's only at the end where it managed to make the audience actually care about this encounter. Joel almost blows up the crab, but then, he sees it's eyes, just like how Winnow said you can see if a monster is good or bad by seeing their eyes, like with the giant snail, again, good scene which was well done.Now, for the characters, I think they're neat. Unlike in most apocalypse movies or shows where they always kill each other, here, they're all supportive of each other. Adversity brings cooperation! Anyway, my favorite characters are probably Joel, and Merle (the guy with the cowboy hat), they're very interesting. Merle is brutally honest, but he doesn't want Joel to die, he gives him advice, and for Joel, his humor is pretty good, his arc is also good. I also love how at the end, when Joel turns the map around, he sees all the messages his friends back the bunker left for him, it was so heartwarming.The soundtracks in this movie were not really special in any way, but how they used it was very well done, how they stopped the music at the right moment and stuff was nice.Anyway, this was my disorganized and dumb review. Pretty good movie!",Love and Monsters

699,nicholashartmann,A rough start and a good end! A good 6.7/10 in my eyes.,7,22 April 2021,"I write this review of Love and Monsters (2020) comparing it to the great movies I have seen, Shawshank Redemption, Avengers: Endgame, The Lord of the Rings trilogy, etc. If indeed I were to compare it to other movies in this genre, the score I would give would probably be closer to an 8/10, it is indeed one of the better ones.The Plot:
I must say I do feel a bit disappointed by the first act of this movie. It feels quite rushed as they did not really give the plot introduction enough time to unfold. Maybe I'm just used to long movies though...In hindsight however comes the realization that the twist towards the end of the movie, which starts off the third act, really does prolong the runtime of this movie and therefore that might have been the decision to cut the first act a bit short.As lackluster as I believe the beginning of this movie to be, the ending is quite the opposite. Though to be expected around half way through the movie, it still offers a fulfilling feeling and gives a satisfying ending to it.The plot twist that starts off the third act is utterly unexpected and, as mentioned earlier, prolongs the movie beyond where I thought it would end.At this point I must give some props to the director of this movie, Michael Matthews, as he does use seemingly random objects found throughout the movies world and ties them neatly into the story at a later time.The FX:
The VFX in this movie are quite solid. They are noticable at times, yet quite realistic throughout the most of the movie. The emotions of certain animals are conveyed well in their eyes, which is where the VFX do truly shine.Sound effects are used sparingly. The surround speakers of my 5.1 sound system were only sparingly used. The subwoofer, or low end, was used to emphasize certain actions. I would rate it's use as adaquate, not too much, nor too little.Who is this movie meant for?Well, it is definately a heartwarming family film. You've got your standard drama and tension moments, yet nothing to serious. I would reccomend this movie to an audience of above 12 years of age.PS: Please excuse my english, I am not a native speaker.",Love and Monsters

For the comedy part, most of the humor come from Dylan O'Brian's excellent performance. All main characters are likable and the dog character Boy is so freaking cute. This movie is very suitable for family to watch and for people trying to forget some parts of the reality such as politics. Not so much for forgetting the coronavirus though but I'm craving for fun movies with decent scale of production, and this movie satisfies that craving, at least for now.",Love and Monsters
706,andreapeco,Horrible nonsense plot,6,20 June 2021,"With the budget of this movie would seem legit to expect more, but whether the monsters and cgi are really good the movie as a whole fails simply because of the ""romantic"" plot. The whole plot is garbage, (please someone explain to me how the dog reaches him into a sealed protected costal colony), emotions are scripted. Psychologically nobody would not be angry at the girl who deceive him for seven years and doesn't tell him not to go on a mortal journey when she was still mourning another boyfriend she had, not waiting like him 7 years.

708,alxndrperras,Entertaining nonetheless...,4,22 April 2021,"So basically, Love and Monsters is using this classical (repetitive) formula in witch the main character is at first funny, naive, clumsy, scared of everything and then suddenly turn into a brave and courageous hero as he makes is way to point A to B (as seen with Barry Allen in Justice League, Columbus in Zombieland, Spencer as Doctor Bravestone in Jumanji or Hughie Campbell in The Boys). The CGI are boring but at least you can count on a acting performance just good enough to make it pass over. It's kind of disappointing that they made a teenage movie out of this idea. It would have been interesting to have a Fallout more alike universe transpose in a serie because I feel like they got cut short at the end. Let's say that this movie isn't good but isn't bad either ... if you take in consideration that this movie was made specifically for teenagers.PS : Btw, this movie is not even close from a 7, so don't tell me it's a 8, a 9 or a 10 for god sake.",Love and Monsters

Don't compare it to other apocalypse and zombie or monster movies because it is kinda different. It is also not predictable as you think, you are gonna be surprised especially in the last half hour ,it will go in a different direction in a very good way. Also it does carry a message and it is not just a pointless fun movie. It is suitable for kids and for family watch, it will be really good if you watch with your family in this quarantine, it will cheer you up and it is really suitable for this time in a good way. I really hope you give it a shot because you won't regret it. And of course who doesn't enjoy watching a movie with Dylan O'Brien in it.",Love and Monsters

But nothing can do that, not even Dylan O'Brien, who by the way absolutely gave an amazing performance. It's just that this movie brings nothing more to the dystopian genre, it's a journey movie like other journey movies, it should have been called Dystopia: The Cliche.

During a time when a lit of movies just feel like remakes I feel it had a freshness about it. I love how the monsters were created and how the world had become.

It's riddled with clichés and extremely predictable. It is definitely not in the same league as ""Zombieland"" (which I liked very much) even though it tries very hard to be that kind of movie. The acting is ok and the CGI is fine. It's a family adventure movie and alright for that category but it is no cinematic masterpiece. I personally didn't like it at all but I'm trying to be fair here and my boyfriend really enjoyed the movie.Bottom line: If you have a Netflix subscription, watch it if you don't have anything better to do, but if not, don't go out of your way to see this.",Love and Monsters

762,tylervanbuskirk,Was Not Disappointed,8,19 December 2020,"This was honestly a surprise. I chose this over Tenet to watch last night and I'm very happy I did. Dylan O'Brien is incredible, as well as Michael Rooker. Everyone else is very good, too. It's a coming of age story, thriller, and action movie all rolled into one. I guess it's also a romance but it's more about teaching a lesson rather than having this unrealistic meet cute at the end. But I'll give you my flaws.
1. Narration. The narrating is not necessary in this movie, imo. It kinda feels like it was made up in post production because they didn't think the audience would get it. Here's the thing. We don't need to know why the animals mutated. They could have newspaper headlines hint at the asteroid and the missile radiation and that's it. The Quiet Place didn't rely on narration, why should this?
2. The relationship between Joel and his colony is extremely under developed. Like it didn't feel like Joel was needed or wanted there. So by the end they try to cash in this family dynamic that was never set up. It would make more sense if Joel just went to Minow and Michael Rooker.
3. I applaud the way they handled Joel and Amiee's relationship at the end. The problem is the entire section with the yacht captain and the giant crab was completely pointless. The only good part was the callback to the eyes of creatures. Tbh, I think Amiee should've gone away and Joel goes back to his colony to bring them to Minow and Michael Rooker, and on the way they can encounter a monster and Joel can teach his crew how some are docile. It just felt very out of left field.
All and all, very good movie. Great characters and great story.",Love and Monsters

766,kim-473,Not scary. Not funny. Not even sure I know if it tries to be,3,17 April 2021,"This is one of the strangest movies I ever watched.A mixture of elements pointing in every direction. Comedy, horror, thriller, action, drama, love story. Mixing those elements successfully went well in Pirates of the Carribbean.It doesn't work in this movie.The plot is thin, the acting has this unreal sitcom vibe over it. There aren't any funny lines or situations.You really can't engage with the characters so you don't care if they make it or get eaten.The movie has a little bit of Disney-like childish innocence and cuteness mixed with a voice-overing anti hero like It's raining Meat Balls(2) combined with impressive but not really scary Men in Black-monsters topped with the good old orchestral violins when something good happens. There are elements of Wall-E, Lassie and Fantastic Beasts.It's like the director and writer just thought if we mix it all together this has to be good.Unfortunately you cannot just count on that. Maybe the movie can act as a lesson in that for future movie makers.",Love and Monsters
767,johneberhardt-19841,A pleasant surprise,8,2 May 2021,"I almost turned it off early on as it really looked this was going to be a dud when they started off making the Joel character a total embarrassment to his colony. But the script does let him man up and Joel ends up growing into a nice character after all. Although having the Michael Rooker character train him, making the older man with the most experience the main mentor, would have made this marginally better (but maybe then it would be too much like zombieland?). The dog is a nice touch and the monsters are served up in small doses so you don't get overwhelmed and it allows the story to grow at a nice pace.",Love and Monsters

It would've been better for the storytelling, explore the surface, build the emotion for the characters.Storywise now it felt flat, felt nothing for the other characters except dog and main. Then it ended so quickly and dissatisfying too.Worth a watch at least. Great CGI.",Love and Monsters
769,clercy,Heartwarming and exiting,10,12 November 2020,Dylan O'brien played an amazing part in this movie. It is thrilling to watch the film even tough you are following the story of a nobody on a quest for love the movie has a lot of exiting parts filled with action. I urge everyone to watch it and enjoy the story. I would like to see a sequel to Joel (Dylan's part) his story and I think this movie has a lot of potential to turn into a franchise (if done correctly). Keep up the good work to al the movie makers out there.,Love and Monsters
770,joaomaravilha,Simple and easy story,7,8 May 2021,Honestly little could fail without being the CGI that turned out to be good.

It has such a good and inspirational story. I think that the main actor Dylan O'Brien as we saw as a hero in the series of movies ""The Maze Runner"", just ads a better perspective to this movie. I think that this movie is going to get a lot of positive reviews, if it hasn't already. And that should convince them to make a part 2. Where we could see their journey into the mountains.
They could make the movie easily 2+ hours long because the end was in my opinion a bit to short.Thanks for a great movie and I hope I'll be able to see part 2!",Love and Monsters

The budget is on the lower end so the cgi isn't amazing and the story is a little flat but with a sequel they could dive deeper into this world. I mostly enjoyed the fact that the main character isn't a superhero but a random teen stumbling his way through the movie. All in all a fun adventure movie!,Love and Monsters

There were some small mistakes in the movie, ,, for example the red cloth that gets referenced at the start of the movie, and only once more 2/3 into the movie. Also I would have loved to see a bigger time spent.with Minnow and Clyde. Overall a great movie, but it could have easily been a 10.",Love and Monsters
781,atulkumar-06134,"The Adventure part was really good, But the whole Aimee part was really boring,",7,25 April 2021,"Following our protagonist through the dangerous wilderness was really good, I enjoyed it a lot, The movie disappoints you with not showing more of the protagonist's clan, whole Aimee plot was a good excuse to kick start the journey, but it really lacks the weight and depth, I felt nothing for this girl,
I feel more happy to see Boy coming back but this was disappointing too, Because i was really hoping for our main protagonist to go look for him instead of Boy coming to him,
I mean Boy was the reason why he learned to stood up and have confidence, but then he just left him in the jungle, for this boring subplot of Aimee,
i am looking for a sequel but more monsters and adventures, and Love doesn't only mean to find a Girlfriend or boyfriend,",Love and Monsters

799,eliseallan,Dylan + Kelpie - how could you not enjoy it?,8,17 October 2020,"Fun light-hearted film. The whole cast is great. Dylan strikes the right mix with his character who is just an ordinary dude who perchance survived the monster apocalypse. His character is sensitive, wistful and a bit overwhelmed by the predicament he finds himself in. Jessica Henwick is also great, and not just your ordinary damsel in distress. This is really a coming of age film. It's heartfelt and endearing with a good dose of humour. The set design is kitsch and kooky and the monsters are really just fun/gross (not overly dark and scary). I'm a Queenslander so loved seeing the Gold Coast hinterland and beaches used to great effect. Oh and of course multiple scenes of Dylan and the gorgeous kelpie character bonding was a pretty good vibe. I would highly recommend.",Love and Monsters

Movie theaters are closed, if you were to watch it in one pre covid you would've payed even more. Plus this way for $25 you get to watch it over and over ;) I loved how it wasn't constant gore and action there were nice moments to enjoy and some good comedy in there. Dylan's awesome, he has such good range in his facial expressions and definitely uses that to his advantage. I've never seen an actor do that as well as he does. Loved the dog and the little girl, she added good humor and was adorable, wish there was more scenes with her and clyde! also the dogs original owner? i will never stop wondering who she was she seemed cool. gave it a 9 only because i'd like alil more romance but that's just the girl in me.

Don't get me wrong, I love monsters movies, but often I don't like teen movies. This is not the case, and I don't saying this is a teen movie. It is in some way but it is so realistic and serious in his stuff. Highly recommended. Years in no seeing such a good monster hunt film.",Love and Monsters
820,hazzaburf,All around fun,7,23 November 2020,"In Love and monsters we are greeted with the loveable and goofy character Joel Dawson, a character who is so beautifully played by Dylan O'Brien who brings his normal fun satire to the film. The satirical reliefs that O'Brien's character provides gives a well rounded range of themes within the film. Overall the film's story is easy to follow but still lacks a few needed aspects. In hindsight the film could have included more fleshed out backstories to some of the characters, in some instances characters like cap are not explained with enough depth. I would have liked to have seen these types of characters with a little more insight.",Love and Monsters

Needless to say I was blown away. I had the most satisfying feeling of discovering a movie that far surpassed my admittedly low expectations. Action and light hearted comedy with a touch of drama surrounding the noble quest of looking for love no matter the odds.In general terms, I give this an 8.

825,trevorwilson-72333,We Need More,9,9 January 2021,"I have seen a lot of critic reviews not in favor of this movie. On the contrary I believe that this movie is a breath of fresh air with the apocalyptic side of the film. The creatures are scary yet intriguing and it's nice to not see the typical zombie. O'Brien is an actor that has a very good grasp on humor and intensity as seen in his other movies and supporting roles. He has a lot of room for character development in this movie and he is the perfect actor to bring his character to his full potential. Not to mention the open ended conclusion to the movie and the relationship arcs between characters. This movie deserves a trilogy, we have yet to see the real emotion that O'Brien and Michael Rooker can bring to the table. I give this movie 9/10 only because I think we deserve to see more.",Love and Monsters

I'm not really hopeful those days and i never really smile.I really think the people who made this movie had a good time, and for once i think most characters were likeable, unlike every movie of the genre in which everyone is rude except for the hero.Anyway, if you too are having a hard time nowadays, because of ... you know, well maybe this movie can give you a bit of hope :)Ps: Dylan O Brien if you see this somehow do you wanna go out after ... you know ? we could go eat garlic bread or something idk you tell me.",Love and Monsters

830,joegodding,'Love and Monsters' has huge potential for a sequel.,10,9 February 2021,"I'll say it as simply as I can, 'Love & Monsters' is fantastic! From the interesting and well thought out characters & the incredible monsters each with their own personalities, to the caliber of cast and cgi that this film has displayed, we are instantly transported into a world of imagination, inspiration and wonder. A world so close to home yet not quite as we know it, you can't help but retain this feeling of intrigue throughout. Plus with a storyline full of twists, turns and sideswipes, coupled with the ups and downs of a complicated post apocalyptic romance, 'Love and Monsters' is quite easily one of the most interesting and exciting films to have hit the screens in recent years & has huge potential for a sequel! It is in of itself a brilliant and well rounded film that's stands very firmly by itself, but it also presents us with such a fantastic lead on to another film! There is a lot of room for creativity in both the character evolution and the new creatures that could appear in a sequel or prequel. I would very much like to see this film continue to grow and move forward towards some sort of extended world in which, let's face it, we've all thought about and believed we could survive it too. Much like 'Zombieland' this film is focused more on the positive side of the apocalypse whilst still providing a hearty amount of ""That was tense"" action and adventure! All in all I think more from this universe would not be something people are going to want to miss.",Love and Monsters
831,ahyat-99473,Overrated film,1,23 April 2021,This is the most overrated film ever. They made the main character to look so dumb and useless.,Love and Monsters
832,paris_giovanni,Fun and way better than expected,8,18 November 2020,"Went in thinking Love and Monsters would just be another hack and slash monster movie. Was pleasantly surprised to find a post-apocalyptic road show with some depth.
The special effects are overall very well done but the environmental sfx are pretty awesome and don't hit you over the head.
The acting is very good and I see all the mains doing a lot more work.
Biggest flaw I saw was with the love story. There is no way that 2 healthy, unattached young-adults don't have sex after saving each other's lives. If they have a sequel maybe they will deal with that.
I highly recommend this movie.",Love and Monsters
833,raymondreiz,Give Us A sequel or a Video game Plz !,9,8 April 2021,"A simple story but told in a meaningful manor, the characters are great, one which we can relate and feel attach to. Joel the average guy and passionate and slowly learning, his development is inspiring to watch. Clyde the veteran that we all hope to meet and give us advice, Aimee kind and taking care of the folks but still tough enough to take care business.It show people are still good and that we can survive Together. This turn out to be a better film than i expect.And also the details about the monsters are very realistic and cleverly crafted. All these monster are beast before mutated. You can avoid or survive or hunt them if you study them.

Still, I believe that this proposal would work better in a series format. However, it is not weak and forgettable, as Netflix's ""Bright"", which I also believe would work best in a series format. It is a good film, with excellent visual effects, soundtrack, makeup and costumes, as well as a great message to be conveyed, especially in the days. The only thing that really bothered me was that the film sometimes forgot issues that it inserted in the script and have little time time for a big universe to be explored.

839,ljtirazona-58708,Surprisingly Good!,9,15 April 2021,"This movie, while not breaking any new cinematic ground, is a very well-executed instance of the Hero's Journey template.Going in, I didn't have much expectations from this movie.I found the plot to be very predictable - within the first 20 minutes, I was able to predict the remaining major plot points of the movie.However, as the movie went on, it started to draw me in. It's a combination of action, adventure, and light horror, all wrapped in a plot that is primarily driven by the romantic longing of the hero.It wasn't as predictable as I though it would be, though. While the plot is overall formulaic, there were some twists that added to the great execution of the formula.Dylan O'brien's lead character is very likeable, and all the various relationships he develops over the course of the movie is the heart and soul of the movie.The ending was great - it resolved a lot of plot points, but was open enough to leave me wanting to know more stories from that universe. A sequel can pick up directly where this movie ends!A 'must-watch' for me. If the team gets back together for a sequel, I'm all in!",Love and Monsters

841,fluffywolfme,Glad I finished watching it.,7,15 April 2021,"The movie starts with the main character telling what happened to the world from an authoritative perspective which didn't make sense and I almost stopped watching thinking this wasn't going to be for me.Luckily I got it in my head that, essentially the main character has no idea what exactly happened and just narrated whatever he believed to be the case. (Because the facts he spits out are nonsensical, the thing about the rockets that is).I think the start would've been better if the lines had portrayed that he didn't really know what happened by putting in a maybe here and a probably there, instead of implying that the main character is straight telling actual facts.Anyway those beginning of the movie facts aren't at all important to the movie, and it is fine if no one really knows what caused 'things to go bad'.The movie is really about a little big adventure of a random normal guy, who chasing dreams yet finding truths.",Love and Monsters

858,heidihoh0,Great show that really needs a sequel!,8,14 May 2021,"This was a surprisingly fun, quirky movie with some really great heartfelt moments for the main character played by Dylan Obrien. He is such a great actor and he really makes you care about his character. The CGI was great and the monsters were well done. Big giant bugs and critters of the like tend to look pretty cheesy in most movies but they did a good job of making them look real enough that they were more on the creepy scary side, rather than the cheesy stupid side. There are also some other supporting actors who were awesome and made the movie so much more interesting. By the end of the movie I was invested in all the characters and really want to know what happens next for them. This movie deserves a sequel, or better yet, a TV series. I would absolutely have to binge watch a Love and Monsters TV show!I really enjoyed this movie! I would have given it 10 stars if it weren't for the sexual content and bad language. I used family friendly filtering that made it watchable for my entire family. The filtering cut out all of the inappropriate and unnecessary garbage that didn't need to be there in the first place to make it a good movie!",Love and Monsters

I couldn't be more wrong. I loved it 😍❤♥I was really worried for the protagonist when he found himself in bad situations, like the frog and the sand-gobblers, ""really scary, if you imagine yourself in the same set-up"".They found the perfect balance between action, adventure and drama, which, in my opinion worked really great. I WATCHED IT 4 TIMES IN THE PAST MONTH. Actors and crew did a very good job, Dylan mostly - I am a big fan of Teen Wolf to say less.""Being afraid doesn't have to mean you shouldn't live the way you want, but being careful when in rough situations.""",Love and Monsters

874,razorei-korianti,Such a pleasant surprise,8,18 January 2021,"This movie was so much better than I expected it to be. Dylan OBRIEN was excellent.
The only negatives I might have: couple of plot holes, dog was underutilized.
Biggest issue was the length I wanted a longer movie to be honest. I feel like there is a good 20mins worth of story and action either left out, or simply never filmed.
Overall, excellent film. If the trailer is interesting and you accept it for the feelgood movie it is, you will not be disappointed.",Love and Monsters
875,flavim,I second the sequel sentiments!,10,13 May 2021,"This is such a fun world and I'd love to see more of it! With the same characters learning to live in their new world. Finding new allies with some of the ""monsters"" and new (or eternal) struggles with the worst parts of humanity and nature. Man vs. Man. Man vs. Nature. It's a fertile world and I'd really enjoy seeing more of it.And on a side note, this is the exact kind of space I love to watch Dylan O'Brien acting in: action packed but also fun and witty. Dramatic and heroic but also humble and clever. More
of this please!",Love and Monsters

885,mitsukai79,Love and Monsters is definitely worth it,10,17 October 2020,Love and Monsters is set seven years after the monster apocalypse with 95% of the world's population gone. It follows Joel Dawson who leaves his colony to travel approximately 85 miles to get to his high school sweetheart's colony. Along the way he meets an Australian kelpie named Boy who helps him along the journey. He also meets eight year old Minnow and her guardian Clyde. Both of them are wise to the current world and offer Joel some important rules to live by. The movie offers some much needed entertainment for everyone you can watch again and again. It is definitely a must see movie. I've seen some bad reviews and I'm left wondering if we saw the same movie or not. The one I saw was awesome and left me with a sense of absolute delight. You'll laugh and smile throughout the movie.,Love and Monsters

895,andrewraymond87,Surprisingly Good,7,19 October 2020,"I was expecting a low budget B movie for teens, but got something very promising! I thought it was well rounded out. It reminded me a lot of Zombieland but less edgy, more heartfelt. I gave it a 7 because I thought it was definitely worth a watch and I'll be on the lookout for a sequel. That said, it was a little bland for what it was. It contained all the right ingredients but would have greatly benefited from a little more spice. It's not really an issue, I'm just saying I think they definitely had the right idea and could see this team pushing a sequel or another film to the next level. Strong hidden gem potential, great work.Good CGI, semi-original story, good pacing, thought the acting was fine, there were exciting moments, tense ones too, as well as light-hearted and emotional scenes. Very well rounded. Recommend to people who liked Zombieland or the original Jumanji",Love and Monsters
896,graycelou017,My favorite movie,10,27 May 2021,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It's original, heart warming and so entertaining. I hope they make a sequel about Joel and his adventures.",Love and Monsters

898,Aniketos,Surprisingly great flick!,10,15 June 2021,"I didn't expect to see such an amazing movie! The actors did a really great job and the directing was impeccable. Even though the plot wasn't particularly innovative, it was exciting and entertaining from start to finish. The character development was plausible and sometimes quite surprising. The FX and action sequences were also on a high level. The film outshines many big-budget productions. I would definitely watch a sequel if it's just as well-made.",Love and Monsters
899,hallowelt,Loveable feel good movie,9,10 June 2021,"""Love And Monsters"" is a romantic post-apocalyptic road movie with an unfortunate name. But as with eg. ""Cowboys and Aliens"" there is a really good and entertaining film behind the stupid and uncreative title.The budding romance between two teenagers is suddenly interrupted by an apocalypse. Meteorites bomb the earth and the defense with missiles backfires somehow. The result is quite drastic mutations in flora and fauna. All sorts of bizarre monsters emerge, which force the few surviving people on earth to flee into underground bunkers. A few years after the disaster, Joel, our protagonist, learned on the radio that his childhood sweetheart survived in another bunker just a few days' journey away. Wildly determined to finally see her again, the rather fearful and clumsy hero sets off on a dangerous journey.The basic tone is humorous and the film doesn't take itself seriously, which is a bit reminiscent of the style of ""Zombieland"", only the tenor is less cynical and more cordial and lovable. In general, the film is kitschy but always in a very positive and never ridiculous or embarrassing way. Overall, you just have a good time accompanying our hero on his way and experiencing all the bizarre situations he gets into, and you will take all the strange friends he meets into your heart (like a clever four-legged friend or a somewhat out of place but loveable android). The CGI effects work very well overall. This applies to both the monsters and the atmospheric post-apocalyptic world, which spreads the flair of a video game a la ""The Last Of Us"". That makes the scenario in the film less realistic, but nice and comic, so that the CGI monsters never seem out of place. The story, which is very typical of road movies, is not the most innovative, but offers enough variety and variation to be entertaining throughout the film. Love and Monsters is therefore the perfect feel-good film for a Sunday afternoon.",Love and Monsters
900,gewd,Funny and entertaining,7,26 December 2020,"I certainly see why people are comparing this movie to Zombieland, even though there are no swarms of monsters. I needed a light weight entertainment after watching Tenet, and this movie certainly delivers entertainment.It's a love story in a survival world, developed on top of funny (and BS) backstory, how the world as we know it, ended by mutated giant bugs.",Love and Monsters
901,ct-12281,"Better than ""Tenet""",9,2 January 2021,"I may make ""Better than 'Tenet' "" my username, because that pretty much applies to all movies made in 2020. ""Love and Monsters"" is better because it knows what it is. It doesn't try to be all things to sci-fi, or monster movies, or anything else. It's about love, and it's about monsters.The dog is magnificent; everyone should be lucky enough to have a pet companion like that. Dylan O'Brien is a perfect Everyman/unlikely hero. And, unlike nearly every movie made in the past five years, it's not mean-spirited. There's an undercurrent of humor and optimism that infuses the whole movie.Watching ""Love and Monsters"" was time well-spent. A sequel would be great, just to see the performers again, but isn't necessary.",Love and Monsters
902,youturtletube,"Awful, welcome to the new age.",1,24 April 2021,"Thanks to Netflix for killing original ideas and redoing the same movies. There is not one original character in this, all the gags, all of the plot is the same stuff, that's been there before. Netflix likes to play safe these days, they steal from what worked before. Minnow might just be the worst character I have seen lately, joined with a really not good acting performance makes you feel like you can hear the director in the background giving advise. I tried to watch this, Netflix really gives us little these days, but even with that low standard, this was bad, really bad.",Love and Monsters
903,sjandric,Is this real but not bad,6,19 April 2021,"Ok watching the first 5 min you know what kind of film you are getting into but they made the monsters seem way more badass then they are. The first monster was a big ant that got killed in a cool way with the crossbow and sure the ant was a little scary but whatever. The next monster seen is a big ole fat frog that is slow and only has a long tongue that could suck you in. Dylan O'Brien runs away from it like it he isn't even going to break a sweat. The next one is a boobytrap he walked right into full of weird wormy things that a single grenade just put to rest. The third monster did it in for me when they were talking about the ""chumbler"" thing and were worried till they showed the thing move and it might as well been going in reverse that thing was so slow. And how about the fourth monster being monster a nice monsters?!? Like really, I'm 40 mins through this movie and the fact that the US Military couldn't take out these monsters like it is a Tuesday lunch then where the heck are my tax dollars going my god !!!",Love and Monsters

There's no way I'm not going to like this movie!As another reviewer said, it is a bit like Zombieland (minus the zombies), and I did find it a little predictable (though it's rare that a movie or show surprises me), but I really liked it!

937,destinyloulou,Boring,4,26 April 2021,"Why does this film have so many high star reviews? Do we not have standards anymore? The acting wasn't great, it was basic I might even say boring. I always finish films and barely stop them while watching them but I even concidered not finishing this one. It got better near the end. The best thing about this film was probably the dog and I normally don't even really like dogs. Although it did not really make sense how well groomed the dog looked.",Love and Monsters

941,mtpurdon,Which are You ?,7,25 December 2020,"I think there are two types of reviewers here. Those that favor the movie are those who can relate to the fear of road-rage against them. Then there are those who give this movie low marks because this movie it is hard for them to watch because they feel guilty, remembering and knowing they are of the type that reacts with road-rage anger while on the streets.",Love and Monsters
