0,TheLittleSongbird,I have yet to see a film this decade that touched me as much as The Notebook did,10,3 September 2010,"I didn't see the movie or read the book until fairly recently, and to be honest I wasn't expecting to love either. The book I fell in love with immediately, it was beautifully written and honest with one of the most heartfelt endings I have yet to read in a book. The film is every bit as good. I have seen movies that have moved me massively(ie. The Elephant Man), however The Notebook for me is the only one this decade that completely touched me. It is wonderful to look at, has a lovely soundtrack, a touching story and a great script. The direction also makes sure that the film hits all the emotional buttons, which it does. Even the happy moments made me cry tears. The acting is great not only from Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams(who are great together as well) but from Joan Allen, Gena Rowlands, James Marsden and the old pro James Garner. In conclusion, very touching and a must watch whether you like the genre or not. 10/10 Bethany Cox",The Notebook
1,bkoganbing,Noah And Allie Bridging The Years,10,15 August 2008,"James Garner and Gena Rowlands and Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdam pay the same pair of lovers during the World War II years and up to the present day. All four of them and the cast assembled by director Nick Cassavetes present a wonderful romantic film that will bridge the generations.We meet Noah and Allie in their old age at first. We see their story later unfold, but we learn that while they may have lived happily it was not ever after as old phrase goes. Old age is a time of memories and if you're lucky enough to find your soulmate they will be shared memories. And that's half the enjoyment of memories, someone to remember the shared experience with.But when one of the partners develops Alzheimer's it's devastating for the one who doesn't have it to watch the other deteriorate. And that's what's happening with Garner as he visits Rowlands in a nursing home.On this visit he's prepared though. Garner has brought a notebook in which he's written down their story. The nurse introduces him as a stranger who takes her outside and proceeds to read their story as though this happened to two other people in an attempt to reach Rowlands.And in flashback we see their story and as Gosling and McAdams we see the ups and downs of a poor boy/rich girl romance. That makes up the bulk of the film. Gosling and McAdams are most definitely each other's soulmates, but her parents do their best to keep them apart and both get involved with other people, Jamie Anne Allman and James Marsden.The sad message is that even for the most right of couples, there's no such thing as happily FOREVER after at least on this Earth. I've had several two aunts with Alzheimer's disease and I could relate to what Garner was going through with Rowlands. And I have aunt right now who is 89 and in my last conversation with her I could see her memory going and how that must be affecting my uncle who is the same age.The four leads and the rest of the cast are just perfect in their parts. Director Nick Cassavetes is of course directing his mother here and you know they were completely in sync. I cannot believe The Notebook got no Oscar nominations at all, it's a travesty how it was overlooked by the Academy. It did get several awards and nominations from other venues, but not from the Academy.The Notebook is a perfect romantic story and the nature of it will appeal to all the generations we have living on the planet.",The Notebook
2,SnoopyStyle,well made traditional romance,7,14 June 2014,"In a nursing home, Duke (James Garner) reads a romantic story to an old lady (Gena Rowlands) with dementia. The story starts at a carnival in 1940. Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) meets young heiress Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams) spending the summer in Seabrook. Noah won't take no for an answer. She eventually let her guard down and spends the summer with the lumber yard worker. Her parents do not approve but let the summer fling go on. Near the end of the summer, they visit an abandoned house called The Windsor Plantation. They are interrupted by Fin (Kevin Connolly) who tells them that her parents had sent out the police for them. He wants to let her go, they fight, and break up. While attending Sarah Lawrence College, Allie's mother (Joan Allen) kept all of Noah's letters. Noah goes to enlist to fight in WWII and Allie volunteers as a nurse. She meets wounded soldier wealthy Lon Hammond Jr (James Marsden). Noah decides to rebuild the plantation house hoping that Allie will return to him.Nicholas Sparks has made a living writing these melodramatic romances. This one has slightly more depth. First there is the power of the Rowlands Garner pairing to give it weight. Their performances keep this grounded and show what real acting is. They are so good that even cheesy dialog sounds great. But what makes this movie stand out is the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. These are two charismatic personalities and they put a lot of energy into their characters. Gosling has the mischievous cool while McAdams has the adorable spirit. I love that they fight harder than most sappy love story. The fighting generates so much passion. Rowlands' son Nick Cassavetes is directing and he does a good job. The fact that James Marsden isn't playing a douche allowed more believable chemistry between Lon and Allie. I like that the choices aren't laid out as good and evil. I don't particularly like that Noah saw Allie and Lon together. It's too coincidental. It's one of many things in this that is too written. Why 365 letters? Couldn't he write one more? It's another cheesy poetic turns that Sparks like so much. Overall, this is a traditional romance done very well staring two very photogenic big personalities.",The Notebook
3,Horst_In_Translation,The ending makes more than up for occasional weaknesses from the previous 90 minutes,8,2 January 2017,"""The Notebook"" is an American 2-hour movie from 2004, so this one is also already way over a decade old now. It is considered to be a defining movie of the 21st century when it comes to romance, heart-throb and cheering for the characters to become a couple. Lead actors Gosling and McAdams were a couple themselves back then and their performances in this movie made it possibly hard to believe that they split up sooner than later. Many still remember that kiss at the MTV Movie Awards as something truly special that no other awards show from that year had to offer. But first things first: The director is Nick Cassavetes and he is the son of Gena Rowlands who plays a major supporting character here. Another major supporting character is played by the late James Garner. He received an SAG Award nomination for his portrayal and this may have been the closest he ever got to becoming an Oscar nominee, at the tender age of 75 and after almost 50 years in the industry already. The four actors I just mentioned are probably what you can consider the core of the film, the heart and soul. Connolly adds some solid scenes in the first half, Schaff in the second half. These 120 minutes are certainly the most known work for Cassavetes as well as for the two writers Leven and Sardi, even if one of them received an Oscar nomination for the Oscar-winning ""Shine"".So yeah, this film here is really really famous to this day. It was not as much as a box office success as you may think, but still made roughly 50 million more than it cost. I'd imagine it to be a huge magnet for couples, but apparently many of the guys refused to join their girlfriends and it is definitely a movie that is appreciated more by females than by males, possibly because the concept of eternal love and mastering all the hurdles on the path to happiness is a plot subject that female audiences appreciate more with their approach to romance. Anyway, I quite enjoyed the watch here. I do believe the first 90 minutes of the film had occasional struggles in terms of coherent and realistic story-telling, but there were also scenes that made more than up for it, for example the meeting high up in the air when he asks her for a date facing somewhat playfully the danger of suicide. This was one of my favorite scenes from the Gosling/McAdams moments. The short inclusion of war was a bit random as it was too much of an important subject to be rushed in, even if something crucial happens there and it's fine I guess as the story is about love and not politics or war. And besides, it helped putting the film into perspective in terms of what time we were at what point in the movies. There were other good and not so good scenes and it probably depends on your personal preference which ones you like more and which ones will do nothing for you. For McAdams, it has been a pretty good year recently as she managed her first Oscar nomination and Gosling seems on course to winning his first Golden Globe this year, which means the protagonists in this film are far from forgotten.And this especially includes the previously mentioned James Garner, who left us a very touching portrayal of an old man struggling with his place in life now that his beloved wife seems to forget him because of dementia/Alzheimer's. These moments when she remembers him are still what he has that connects the two (apart from the children of course) and what makes his life worth living in the face of his own health problems. I personally do not think that the plot twist about who the old people are is what the movie is about because it can be understood and predicted quickly anyway. It is much more about who they have become and the glorious and happy moments take place in the years that we do not see on screen. What we see is just how they got together / are together. So yeah, the last 20 minutes or so have to be among the most touching stuff you will see from the 21st century. Garner shines and Rowlands plays her part very well too. And the story will certainly make your eyes wet. Nicholas Sparks at his best (apart from A Walk to Remember possibly, one of my favorite films of all time). What can I say? You have to experience it yourself to feel the pain, but also to feel the positive moments that make love the best thing in the world. I also believe that these final moments of the film show us how good the flashbacks were and that they did leave a mark for sure, even if you may not have felt it as strongly while watching these scenes from the 1940s and 1950s for example. You may not be amazed by what you see there, but it's essential to really appreciate the ending. Overall, I think this was a film that is good throughout the entirety and turns great at the end, which makes it one of 2004's best. Of course, I connected especially strongly with the film as I find Alzheimer one of the saddest things ever, but still it was an extremely rewarding watch and it's impossible to not feel anything while seeing it. I highly recommend to see it (if there's still people out there who haven't). And make sure you have your girl next to you and lots of tissues.",The Notebook
4,Prismark10,Then and now,6,27 September 2013,"The Notebook is set in two time frames. There is the present day setting in a nursing home where James Garner is telling a romance story to Gena Rowlands who is a dementia patient.The story he tells from a notebook is about a young country boy (Ryan Gosling) having a romance with a socialite played by Rachel McAdams. The social divide keeps them apart before World War 2 intervenes.The past and present then mesh as we realise the fate of the characters. It is well acted, well have you ever seen James Garner give a duff performance?For Ryan Gosling who may be one of the most edgiest actors in Hollywood at the moment, he plays probably his most normal character yet.The initial flashbacks are a bit corny but once it gets going it has a charm of its own.",The Notebook
5,claudio_carvalho,Beautiful and Sensitive Romance,8,29 April 2014,"In a nursing home, the resident Duke (James Garner) reads a romance for an old woman (Gena Rowlands) that has senile dementia with memory losses. In the late 30's, the wealthy seventeen years-old Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams) is spending summer vacation in Seabrook. The local worker Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) meets Allie at a carnival and they soon fall in love with each other. One day, Noah brings Allie to an ancient house that he dreams on buying and restoring and they make love. But Allie's parents do not approve their romance since Noah belongs to another social class and they travel to New York with her. Noah writes 365 letters to Allie, but her mother Anne Hamilton (Joan Allen) does not deliver them to her daughter.Three years later, the United States joins the World War II and Noah and his best friend Fin (Kevin Connolly) enlist to the army and Allie works as a nurse of the army. She meets the injured soldier Lon Hammond (James Marsden) in the hospital. After the war, they meet each other and Lon, who is wealthy and handsome, proposes Allie. Meanwhile Noah buys and restores the old house and many people want to buy it. When Allie accidentally sees the photo of Noah and his house in a newspaper, she feels divided between her first love and her commitment with Lon. Meanwhile Duke stops reading to the old lady since his children are visiting him in the nursing home. ""The Notebook"" is a beautiful and sensitive romance with a love story that is not shallow and makes you think of how fast time goes by. The screenplay and lines are wonderful and the director Nick Cassavetes succeeds in making a movie that makes you feel different emotions, from heartwarming to heartbreaking feelings. The magnificent cast is composed by top-notch actors and actress and the cinematography and location are superb. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Diário de Uma Paixão"" (""Journal of a Passion"")",The Notebook
6,kosmasp,Romance never dies,10,21 July 2009,"If it is depicted as it is in this movie, anyway. A movie, that makes you fall in love with Rachel McAdams (or maybe her male counterpart, depending on your orientation), a movie that actually convinces in it's romantic roots, which sadly can't be said about many movies. Then again, this is based on a novel, which I unfortunately haven't read yet and which could mean the difference.The complex storyline has us staying with two characters (James Garner and Gena Rowlands are genuinely fantastic and the center piece/gravitas of the movie), while we listen to a story that is being told. While that means, we have a few characters that we have to follow and different stories that we have to stay on focus with, we never lose touch with any of them. Which is a great achievement of the book (I guess), but also of the director and the cast. Although it just has it's 5th anniversary, I consider it a classic (and I don't use that term often)",The Notebook
7,gavin6942,One of Those Love Stories That Will Go Down in History,7,29 August 2007,"Noah Calhoun sees Allie Hamilton across the fairgrounds and falls instantly. He persuades her to date him, and before long a summer romance blossoms. But can a love survive class differences, a world war, an evil mother and years of time? If you believe in love -- true love -- this is a film you have to see.I watched this movie for the wrong reasons with the wrong person, and liked it anyway. The wrong reason was because of the persistent rumor that you could not watch this movie without crying. Especially if you cried during ""A Walk to Remember"". Well, I streamed tears pretty heavily during AWTR, much to the amusement of my girlfriend at the time. But I did not cry at all during ""The Notebook"". Though the person I watched it with was a bit moist in the eyes. That person was my good friend Kenn, which I think made the film less sentimental because he's not exactly the person I ideally wish to cuddle up with.I loved Ryan Gosling in this film, especially with the righteous beard. I'm not so sure about the casting of Rachel McAdams, though. I'm quite certain her character was supposed to be as air-headed and annoying as she is, but I just didn't find her likable or attractive. Gosling could have done so much better. (But I'm a Mandy Moore fan, so I'm a little biased.) The basic elements of love are here: don't listen to your parents, don't worry about money. Follow your heart. True loves conquers all. It's not a new story in any way. Sure ,you don't find many films with guys who climb moving ferris wheels, but the basics are here. The other plot, of a woman who lost her memory, is very emotional, but not very riveting for me. I just didn't really care about her (which is probably another reason I didn't cry). But yeah, even ""The Incredible Hulk"" has a love story, so it's not like this is unique.When it comes down to it, if you need a romance movie and you want some sadness and heartbreak and a good cry, I guess you'll want to watch this. Don't be expected to be blown away like others would tell you. Critically speaking, it's not a dynamo. But emotionally, if you're the sort who loves a timeless story of true love, this ranks up there with ""The Princess Bride"" (though it's not nearly as funny).",The Notebook
8,jboothmillard,The Notebook,6,1 October 2008,"I heard a lot about this film from the leading stars, I had a vague idea of what to expect, besides the film plot, but I knew it might be a bit of a cheesy and tear-jerking film, but that's what it makes it good. The story sees old Duke (James Garner) staying in the nursing home with Allie Calhoun (Gena Rowlands), and reading a story, from a notebook naturally, about two characters named Noah Calhoun (Half Nelson's Ryan Gosling) and Allie Hamilton (Mean Girls' Rachel McAdams). Noah was instantly besotted by Allie, but it took a while for her develop true feelings for him, but they were inseparable when she did, sure they had their disagreements, but they were crazy for each other. Unfortunately one argument becomes too much and they separate, Noah writes to Allie everyday, but her disapproving mother Anne (The Bourne Supremacy's Joan Allen) obviously stopped her getting the letters, so he gives up writing on #365 with a fair well letter. Allie has found a new love interest with Lon Hammond Jr. (X-Men's James Marsden), who the parents like a lot, and Noah meanwhile is rebuilding the old house that would have been the ""dream house"", not only to live in, but because he promised Allie he's finish it. Allie is to be married to Lon, but she feels like she can't go through with it until she checks up on Noah, after seeing his face in the newspaper, and he is very happy to see her. She spends a few hours there, including a boat trip across the near lake, and obviously the subject of writing to her comes up, and when she knows the truth, they kiss, and (surprisingly) she loses her virginity. They do have another argument, about the marriage, and she feels she has to go back, and you wonder if she'll come back, and thank goodness she did. Oh, and by the way, they got married and had kids, Duke and Allie are obviously them older, but the love disappeared when Allie developed memory loss, caused by dementia and Alzheimer's, and it's really sad when she does remember it, but her memory goes again, only returning in the end again, when they die together. Also starring Kevin Connolly as Fin, Home Alone 3's David Thornton as John Hamilton and Sam Shepard as Frank Calhoun. Gosling and McAdams are pretty convincing, the support from Allen is good too, it is just a good old fashioned weepy melodrama. Good!",The Notebook

The young couple is quickly separated by Allie's upper-class parents who insist that Noah isn't right for her. Several years pass, and, when they meet again, their passion is rekindled, forcing Allie to choose between her soul mate and class order. This beautiful tale has a particularly special meaning to an older gentleman (James Garner) who regularly reads the timeless love story to his aging companion (Gena Rowlands),"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.""The Notebook"" is a pretty and predictable love story. Mr. Gosling and Ms. McAdams never seemed (to me) like they would age into characters like those essayed by Mr. Garner and Ms. Rowlands. Many times, the younger lovers appear to be modeling, rather than playing, their roles. The older couple is more enjoyable. Garner's performance, and narration, is particularly strong. James Marsden (as Lon Hammond) and Joan Allen (as Anne Hamilton) have interesting, underdeveloped roles. (Ms. Allen may been channeling Ellen Burstyn's ""Lois Farrow"").The ""teenage"", and later, undressing scenes are very funny. And, some of the characters' implausible actions (the 365 letters, for example) could be explained as embellishments and/or enhancements made by Rowlands' character, in her ""The Story of Our Lives"" account. It is interesting that the lead characters write, at different times, a prolific amount of material to be read at a later time. With the exceptions of Robert Fraisse's photography and Gosling's dirty undershirt, the film applies too much gloss.****** The Notebook (5/20/04) Nick Cassavetes ~ Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, James Garner, Gena Rowlands",The Notebook

11,sunwarrior13,Good Enough To Rise Above Melodrama,10,28 September 2012,"The Notebook is a romantic drama film directed by Nick Cassavetes, based on the romance novel of the same title by Nicholas Sparks. It stars Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as a young couple who fall in love during the early 1940's. Their story is narrated from the present day by an elderly man played by James Garner, telling the tale to a fellow nursing home resident, played by Gena Rowlands.The film's story revolves around Noah Calhoun's regular visits to a female patron of an area nursing home. Rather than bore her with the inanities of everyday life, Calhoun reads from an old, faded notebook containing the sweeping account of a young couple whose love affair was tragically put to a halt after their separation in the midst of World War II. Seven years later, the couple was reunited, and, despite having taken radically different paths, they found themselves unable to resist the call of a second chance.Bland and sentimental, the movie is old-fashioned filmmaking aimed at an old-fashioned viewers.But nevertheless,It's hard not to admire its unabashed sentimentality.It is definitely too clumsily manipulative put tears into the viewer and good enough to rise above its melodramatic clichés.",The Notebook

On a daily basis he visits Allie who has sadly gone senile, regaling her with a romantic tale from a well worn notebook.I'm choosing not to write too much on this smashing romantic film because personally I feel that first time viewers are better served not knowing too much about it. It's not a cop out or any form of laziness, it's that the impact of the piece will be far heightened without prior knowledge of the films basic plot structures. What I will write, though, is that the film is adapted by Jeremy Leven and Jan Sardi from the hugely popular novel by Nicholas Sparks, it's unashamedly sentimental and its intention is to pull your heart strings and to tap those tear ducts.Very well acted by Ryan Gosling, Rachael McAdams {superb in fact}, James Garner, Gena Rowlands, Joan Allen and Sam Shepard, gorgeously photographed by Robert Fraisse {I swear a swan lake sequence is heavenly in its execution}, and directed with almost an uncanny awareness of the required pace by Nick Cassavetes, technically the picture stands tall and proud. Really though, it's the story {and the story within the story} that lifts it to the higher echelons of romantic films past and present, I'm not doubting that you need to be in the right frame of mind for such a sentimental picture, but for anyone who has been in love, is in love, or just wants to find love, The Notebook is an essential viewing, so don't let the naysayers tell you any different. 9/10",The Notebook

It must have been 90 degrees and 200% humidity in the shade! The temperature made me do it!Nick Cassavettes' style of direction is completely opposite of his father's, the otherwise innovative and genial late John Cassavettes. In electing to film this light weight book, he chose a possible easy crowd pleaser, or an excellent way to get me out of the sun into the air conditioning of the movie theater.The story is one cliché after another. The worst of the film is Ryan Gosling, an actor that must have a good agent behind him because if he had to rely on his acting abilities, he'd starve to death. Rachel McAdams is irritating as Allie, the rich Southern girl at the center of the story.Gena Rowland's Alzheimer's is cinematic! Being confined to a nursing home, she is groomed lovingly; her gorgeous shade of blonde, is maintained by the attentive staff! Talk about a reality check! This film stretches one's imagination big time.How about David Thornton, as Allie's father. Was young Nick Cassavettes aware that he comes on the screen as the worst possible non-Southern stereotype in the movies throughout the ages? I always have to think twice about comments in this forum calling for an Oscar consideration so early in the year. Come next February, let's hope the colleagues of these ""stars"" will forget about them and of this unfortunate silly film.Don't say you weren't warned.

Surely, some editing would have improved the overall impact of the love story.It's the rich girl/poor man kind of tale with physical attraction being the glue that holds them together at the beginning until their love deepens and it seems inevitable that theirs will be a lifelong bond. Then the girl's wealthy parents disapprove of the affair heading toward the altar and scheme a way of separating them by sending the girl off to New York and leaving her love behind in the mid-west. His numerous letters to her are kept from her and gradually she comes to believe that their love has died out and is wooed by another, wealthier young man (JAMES MARSDEN) who is serious about cementing their relationship.But the love story is framed by a flashback technique that has the man, Noah (JAMES GARNER) telling the story to an elderly lady in a nursing home (GENA ROWLANDS) who encourages him to tell it, telling him she likes ""this kind of story"", before she realizes, at the end, that the tale is about her own relationship with him. She is a woman in the early stages of Alzheimer's and at one point suddenly turns on him and says, ""Who are you?""It's an unabashed tear-jerker, the kind I thought they didn't make any more, and it's a well crafted one with shimmering color photography of outdoor locales and extremely well acted by a more than competent cast that gets every nuance out of the complex characters.RYAN GOSLING as the young Noah is outstanding, perfectly capturing the enormous feelings he has for the girl, and RACHEL McADAMS is wonderfully sweet and sassy as the girl who has to decide which man she will spend the rest of her life with.For anyone wondering if they still made tear-jerkers in this jaded and cynical age of hard-edged films, this one fills the bill.

18,zardoz-13,A Beautiful Tearjerker!!!,9,11 April 2015,"""The Notebook"" qualifies as one of the better Nicholas Sparks' romantic dramas. Ryan Gosling plays the young Noah Calhoun, and James Garner plays the elderly Noah. The love of Noah's life Allie is played by Rachel McAdams during her younger years and Gena Rowlands in her later years. Tragically, Allie suffers from dementia and winds up living in a nursing home. Noah enters the same nursing home so he can be with Allie, and he reads to her every day. She loves the story that he reads to her and constantly wonders how it is going to end, never realizing that Noah is her actual husband. Allie has bouts of memory loss, but Noah never forsakes her. As good as Gosling and McAdams are as the carefree, reckless lovers, Garner and Rowland anchor this amazing love story. Director Nick Cassavetes shifts back and forth between the young lovers and the elderly lovers. The only problem with this otherwise memorable film is that he slips up and reveals the identity of the Garner character too early while the younger Allie is trying to decide if she wants to marry for wealth or for love. This is a genuinely touching romance. Nobody gives a bad performance, and there is nothing trite about it. The last scene is guaranteed to make women cry.",The Notebook
19,Boba_Fett1138,Very professional and well made movie. Cast & crew overcome the movie its clichés.,7,11 July 2006,"""The Notebook"" is better than just your average romantic movie for a couple of reasons.The first and foremost reason for me was the look of it. It had an obvious high budget (at least for its genre) that was well spent. The did a good job at recreating the '40's, with lots of nice looking sets, cars and costumes. The cinematography was beautiful and made the settings of the movie really come forward into the story.As for the story itself it wasn't really anything new and was filled with the typical clichés you could expect from a movie about a boy and a girl falling in love, of which one is from the 'upper-class' and the big city and the other of the 'lower-class' and from a small town. Take away the movie its good actors and budget and you'll have your average romantic movie. The story certainly is not strong and thick enough to carry the entire movie on its own. Sure, the movie does have its original moments, especially in its non-linear storytelling but it on its own is not good or powerful enough to make the movie really any interesting.The cast consists out of some really impressive names, mainly the supporting cast. Actors such as James Garner, Sam Shepard and Joan Allen help to make the movie an extra respectable one and they add a certain bit of extra. Really great in this movie was James Marsden. Lots of people criticize him for his part in the X-Men movies, in which he is quite boring but when you watch him in this movie and others you'll notice that he is actually nothing less than a greatly talented actor. The leading actors Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling are obviously not just mainly cast for their acting skills but more because of their 'natural' style and look. Every guy should be able to identify himself with Noah and every girl should be able to identify herself with Allie. They deliver their lines in a very natural way and the help to make the story more believable than it in fact really is.Still I feel that the romance in this movie is flawed. It never becomes obvious what it is that makes Allie so great and perfect for Noah and vice versa and why their love is so much more special and powerful than anyone else's. It never gets fully obvious or explained in the movie, at least not to my satisfaction.But for most part the professional cast & crew overcome the movie its clichés and weaknesses, until the ending. The ending was completely unnecessary, over-the-top and just mainly totally unlikely and unbelievable. You can say that it sort of ruined the movie its romantic and powerful feeling for me. I would had seriously rated this movie a 8 out of 10, right until the last couple of minutes. The movie should had ended earlier on and abandoned this crazy, unlikely, over-sentimental ending.Still I feel that due to its professionalism involved, I'm talking about both cast & crew, this movie is still way better than just another cliché filled romantic 'chick-flick'. Even if you aren't into these sort of movies (like myself), this movie is worth seeing and worth your time. It's beautifully made and really no bore to watch, despite the obvious moments and stereotypical clichés. See this movie for the whole package, not just the story.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Notebook
20,phd_travel,Passionate and sweeping,10,12 June 2013,"Once every generation there is a romantic movie that just works. In the 80s it was ""Somewhere in Time"". In the 2000s it was ""the Notebook"". There is an epic sweep of time and passion that feels real. The leads are convincing and moving. Rachel McAdams is a luminous expressive actress and every emotion of joy and sadness is shown on her face. Ryan Gosling's understated passion is a perfect counterpoint to Rachel's performance and the chemistry between them is undeniable. He is right for the underdog part. The niceness of the characters is refreshing. Supporting cast is well chosen from Joan Allen to James Marsden. The older characters are good played by James Garner and Gena Rowlands although they look nothing like the younger ones.The music used and score are appropriate for the time. The filming on location in South Carolina is beautiful and evocative adding much to the charm of the movie.It isn't a perfect movie - some of the dialog isn't well written. Although the past and present story lines are what makes this story unique, some of the flashing back and forth is distracting and the dementia is a little overwhelming. The class difference thing is a bit clichéd. But in the end it doesn't matter. It's not just the ultimate chick flick date night movie. It works as a whole and remains the most poignant and deeply felt of the Nicholas Sparks stories.",The Notebook
21,StevePulaski,The cinematic romance that tests reality and fantasy,8,23 October 2011,"Maybe I'm just too cynical for the subject matter, but I didn't shed a tear during The Notebook. I watched what is said to be ""one of the saddest films ever made"" dry-eyed. And I'm an emotional person. I've cried probably to more films than you, the person reading this right now. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing to get very emotional during a film. I think that shows a sign of good filmmaking.I personally have a strict rule where if I cry during a film I must give it some sort of a positive review. That means the film actually made me feel for its fictitious characters and their story and struggle. Therefore it is a film not to be missed. Whether I cry tears of joy, happiness, sadness, calamity, or frustration, the film will get some sort of positive review.And now I'm faced with The Notebook, apparently one of the saddest films in existence and I didn't get emotional once. Something must be wrong. The film stars young actors Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as two, and I use this term effectively, star-crossed lovers who meet in South Carolina during the summer.Gosling is Noah, while McAdams is Allie. This is the forties so when a guy likes a girl he really likes a girl. Noah and Allie meet at a carnival, and soon enough, thinks sparkle and they become in young love. Noah is a local boy, while Allie derives from a rich family who is said to have ""more money than God."" They fight a lot, and sometimes can be extremely physically and emotional abusive. But what love is perfect? The story is told by an elderly man talking to an elderly woman in a nursing home. This is where the film's first major problem comes in - you can see the ""twist"" coming a mile away. I won't spoil it, but it seriously goes without saying. The elderly man is played by James Garner, who comes with a strange presence, and Gena Rowlands as the elderly woman.The man continues to tell the story of the lovers, who eventually part ways and then reunite years later. The first half of the film is well-written, extremely well acted, and comes with enriching photography. Then the film just becomes a little cliché and somewhat unbelievable as it wraps up.It doesn't state this blatantly, but The Notebook is a strong romantic-fantasy. Perhaps one of a teenage girl's imagination. Things happen in the film that stretch the line of reality very, very far. The chemistry is believable, but the story is only about half. I don't believe a girl I know would stick by a man so emotionally abusive to a woman. Not to mention in the world we live in today.This cinematic romance is cute, but nonetheless predictable. I mentioned Allie comes from a rich family, and boy does she occupy every characteristic of it. From the controlling mother, to the ""everything she wants but a man"" personality, she truly is the carbon copy of a rich female. Noah, on the other hand, is your typical local boy with his mind on working and girls.The Notebook is cute, yet I think more shallow then people see. I believe the idea of it, to a female, overshadows how far-fetched it truly is. It's every woman's dream - to find a man who is so willing to be with this woman he devotes half his life to doing things for and about her. The problem is something that is hard to explain. As a cinematic romance fantasy it works. As a realistic love story it doesn't.Romances have come a long way. It's strange, but as a male I really do appreciate them. I think I like the ""invisible guy gets the dream girl"" type films more than the true cinematic romances. But that doesn't mean I can't appreciate these types of films. The Notebook is truly a good film, but many women should be aware this is about as far-fetched as a love story can be from the twist to the very end.Starring: Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, James Garner, Gena Rowlands, Sam Shepard, James Marsden, and Joan Allen. Directed by: Nick Cassavetes.",The Notebook
22,Smells_Like_Cheese,"You're joking, right?",4,9 February 2005,"""Titanic"" was more romantic than this, and that's not saying much. JJO999, YOU BETRAYED ME!!! Everyone, and I mean everyone, ""Oh, my god, this movie is so romantic"", ""This is one of the best movies of the year."" Please! Movie making wise, yeah, it was done well. I'm more than willing to give that credit. But this was seriously the most romantic movie? Not really. The ending was a little sweet, but not like ""OH MY GOD""*SOB!!!* kind of sweet. I'm sorry, maybe I'm just a cold hearted romantic. To tell the truth, I didn't want to really see this movie, but like I said, everyone told me that it was great. So, I was expecting great. The story was just too predictable and long. But for hopeless romantics, I can see them falling for a sappy story.4/10",The Notebook
23,KineticSeoul,Beginning for Nicholas Sparks,7,24 February 2011,"Sometimes I like to watch a romantic film by myself which is one of my guilty pleasure and ""The Notebook"" is basically the epitome of a romance movie. I first saw it I thought it was okay but isn't anything that special, after a second viewing I can tell this is a heartfelt movie. Which maybe sort of brings homage to the movies back in the old days where young teens or couples go to watch a romantic movie. On the downside this film is formulaic and goes in a pretty narrow direction. Sometimes it feels like it's moving along too slowly and the development of the relationships seem a tad bit too quick, with some more development in some areas would have made the plot movie more in a fluid manner. The dialogue is a bit too cheesy at times and the story when it comes to the love aspect of it, isn't all that original...Even when this movie first came out. It's just the character direction could have been more explored, it seemed like the some scenes got cut out because of the length of the film. Even if Noah is a bit of a awkward name Ryan Gosling played this role really well and Rachel McAdams did a good enough job of acting like a girl during the time period the movie takes place. Although it's a mix of her true personality into it as well, although some part of the movie where she was playing a 17 yr old I found ridiculous. And there were few scenes that somewhat tugged on my heartstrings while watching it, although it was probably because of the music and the atmosphere of the scenes. The poor guy falling for a rich girl has been done before numerous times, this film has it's own charm to some degree. And like I said it isn't a clever romance movie and generic at times but it's a touching and heartfelt love story. If your somewhat like to watch romantic movies or movie for couple's, this movie is worth seeing. I also say the scene with one of Noah's quote ""Would you stop thinking about what everyone wants? Stop thinking about what I want, what he wants, what your parents want. What do YOU want? What do you WANT?"" and other dialogues during that scene left a big impact. It was simply some very good dialogue in a romance film. Which is why I am giving this movie a higher score than I thought I would over a hour and thirty minutes into it. It's a simple love story but well done.7.8/10",The Notebook
24,sddavis63,It's All About Love,7,31 May 2008,"The best thing about ""The Notebook"" is probably its simplicity. There's nothing complicated about it. It's all about the love shared by two very different people who have built a life together in spite of their differences, and who face their declining years together, with all the challenges those declining years bring. It's sweet, it's romantic, it's emotional (and, yes, at times it gets a bit too sappy) - it's probably the epitome of what we think of when we speak about a ""chick flick."" And it's very good. The premise is - as I said - surprisingly simple. Allie (Gena Rowlands) is confined to a nursing home because of dementia. She can't remember anything - not even her family. Her husband Noah (James Garner) is fiercely devoted to her, reading everyday from a notebook, in which Allie penned the story of their love, a story that just every now and then drags her back to reality. We move back and forth from the present day (in the nursing home) to the story of their early love. In their earlier days, Allie and Noah (played by Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling) overcame lots of challenges and pretty long odds to be together. In their declining years, they have many things to overcome to stay together.It's a pleasant movie - sometimes sad, sometimes hopeful, and always passionate in a loving sense. McAdams and Gosling portrayed the young love brilliantly, but the most powerful scene (in my opinion) belonged to Garner, when - after a brief few minutes when Allie had snapped back to reality and they had shared a dance - is suddenly horrified by the fact that she lost everything in an instant and had to be restrained and drugged to be brought under control. It was the look on his face in that scene that stood out for me. The ending of the movie is both sad and happy, and completely appropriate to the story. In the end, the power of love triumphed in spite of all the odds against it. 7/10",The Notebook
25,Buddy-51,mawkish romance,5,12 September 2005,"""The Notebook"" is a trite, hackneyed tale of a poor little rich girl who falls in love with a boy from the wrong side of the tracks. It's South Carolina in the 1940's, and Allie Hamilton is a highly educated, ambitious young lady living under the watchful eyes of her snooty, upper crust parents who have pretty much mapped out her whole life for her. Enter Noah Calhoun, a poor working class boy with a devil-may-care spirit and a zest for living whom Allie falls instantly in love with while she and her parents are staying in town one summer. One look at their daughter's pawing this strapping young man from the lower social orders and the parents are hightailing it back to Charleston with the wayward Allie in tow, bringing an end to a flaming summer romance that somehow manages to live on through a subsequent world war (involving the least emotional war buddy death scene in movie history), Allie's engagement to a wealthy veteran, her eventual Alzheimer's, and Noah's disturbingly scraggly beard (he's too depressed to shave, you see).Even though Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling are appealing as the two young lovers, very little about ""The Notebook"" feels either original or genuine. It seems, in fact, to have been cobbled together from other, considerably more impressive tales of unrequited love in which wealth and class play a key role in keeping the lovers apart. The sad truth is that most of what happens to the pair smacks of dime-novel sentimentality and phoniness. For instance, after a night of powerhouse lovemaking between the newly reunited lovers, Allie wakes up to find herself alone with only a note from Noah telling her to follow the arrows to a surprise. And, lo and behold, what do we see but a long line of arrows lying on the floor leading from the bedroom to a sitting room down the hall. Now, is it really conceivable that Noah sat up all night with a scissors cutting out perfectly formed paper arrows, or is this just one of those scenes that could happen only in the movies? And why does Allie's mother keep all those letters from Noah - 365 of them in one year! - that she carefully hid from her daughter, only to turn them over to Allie years later all tightly wrapped up in a neat little bundle? And I won't even go into the final scene of the movie, which is the worst case of expediency over credibility that I've seen in a movie in a long long time.Based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks, the film, written by Jan Sardi and Jeremy Levin, and directed by Nick Cassavetes, has been structured as one giant flashback, in which a now aged Noah (James Garner) is reciting the tale to Allie (Gena Rowlands), who is suffering from what the doctor calls ""senile dementia"" and so doesn't realize that the story is about them. This approach brings a certain added poignancy to the film - or at least it would were it not undercut by the sappiness of Garner's voice-over narration and that far too heavy-handed conclusion. Joan Allen gives her usual dependable performance as Allie's mother, although her character's 180 degree turnabout at the end seems more a matter of convenience than a carefully though-out metamorphosis within her character. At least the movie doesn't turn Allie's fiancé into an unreasonable and hateful villain. The writers do, at least, deserve some credit for that.In a final note, the film isn't even careful with its period details. For instance, there's a shot (supposedly during war time or immediately thereafter) of characters leaving a movie theater with ""On the Town"" splashed across the marquee. The problem is that the film wasn't even released until 1949!",The Notebook
26,Robert_duder,A Timeless Love Story,9,18 February 2005,"The Notebook seemed to do well and people seemed to enjoy it. I didn't realize it was as good as it turned out to be or I would have seen it much earlier. The Notebook is a beautiful, touching, love story, well acted and wonderfully directed by relative director newcomer Nick Cassavetes.The Notebook takes place during the depression era and throughout the forties. We are introduced to young, hard working, quiet, free spirited Noah. During a chance encounter and the carnival Noah falls in love with a rich débutante named Allie who is visiting the area for the summer with her wealthy parents. His charm and persistence eventually wins her over and the two fall deeply in love and have a passionate summer romance. A misunderstanding forces the young lovers apart for many years and Allie eventually falls in love with another man who is more to her social standards but the passion is not the same. Noah who goes to war, returns and builds his dream home as he always said he would. Once again fate brings the young lovers together and Allie is forced to choose between her first love and the man everyone believes she belongs with. All this is told through an elderly man reading to a woman suffering from senility.First of all, The Notebook is breathtaking. It captures the era is such a way that it draws you in and makes you fall in love with everything about it. It's the most romantic scenery set amongst less than romantic situations such as the depression and war. The story is paced perfectly and we genuinely feel this incomparable love between the two young lovers. That's the most important thing to establish for this story. The twist to the story, to me, was never much of a twist and in fact you'll pretty much know what's going on from the moment it starts but that really only adds to the romantic tone of this film. Canadian Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are steamy together and both play their roles perfectly. You feel each character's emotions and spirit and you feel for both of them. The supporting cast including the amazing James Garner and Gena Rowlands are amazing in their small but so important roles. Anyone looking for a romantic film must see this one!! I admit I didn't overly enjoy the final ending, I think it was a cop out and could have been handled different but it's still a beautiful amazing movie. Possibly the best romance movie I have ever seen. A must see!! 9/10",The Notebook
27,ElMaruecan82,When love transcends reality to become a lasting one... or to remain even longer...,8,11 December 2020,"I saw ""The Notebook"" two weeks ago but my 'record' with the film dates back for a little longer.It was 15 years ago when a banal chat with my buddy ended with the surprising reveal that his all-time favorite movie was a romance named ""The Notebook. Mine was ""The Godfather"", which he loved as well, but there was something oddly touching in that soft spot for a film you wouldn't expect a big burly guy to count among the lovers. And so for many years, my knowledge about ""The Notebook"" was limited to three elements: it starred Gena Rowlands, my all-time favorite actress, it featured a passionate kiss under a rainy sky and it was my friend's favorite film.After finally watching it and relieved with the anticipation of any other emotional climax, I don't think it's anywhere in my personal Top 20 but like Ebert said about Siskel's favorite film ""Saturday Night Fever"": ""we all have movies like that, titles that transcend ordinary categories of good and bad, and penetrate straight to our hearts."" Basically, the film penetrated my friend's heart more than it did to mine and we just don't control our emotions. Had he watched it a few years later, it probably wouldn't have the same effect. That's it, our sentimental weaknesses are due to nostalgic values rather than inner qualities. After all, I do have the same feeling for a movie like ""Young Guns"" though I agree the greatest Western ever it ain't.But it's still fitting that the uncontrollability of feelings is one of the film's central themes. And directed by Nick Cassavetes and adapted from Nicholas Sparks' novel, ""The Notebook"" is both a sparkling romance and a passionately romantic movie and that's not the same thing: a romance focuses on the reality of the relationship, a romantic film makes reality the true obstacle. And as soon as Noah (Ryan Gosling) crosses the path of Allie (Rachel MacAdams) we realize that reality has no bearing whatsoever on him: hanging on a ferris wheel to get a date, laying on the road to contemplate the dark night, the young poet of love would even trade his own personality to be whatever Allie desires. Naturally, it doesn't take long for her to become his reality.But then the harsher reality makes an intrusion when they meet the parents: while Noah's father (Sam Shepard) appreciates Allie, her parents don't disapprove of the romance but disregard it as a summer fling. The mother (Joan Allen) informs Noah that Allie will leave for New York and from that things escalate rapidly to a breakup too melodramatic to be truly sincere. But fate doesn't give them time to take their words back, war pushes Noah further from Allie and the mother pulls a ""Color Purple"" by hiding all Noah's letters. Later we learn that she had lived a similar romance before and didn't want her daughter to do a mistake out of a romantic impulse, especially when you have Lon, a tall, dark, incredibly rich and handsome war veteran who's just proposed her. He's played by James Marsden.That the film doesn't portray him as a villain is the right move because the real antagonists are all the obstacles that keep popping up in the sinuous road between the two hearts. And at that part of the review, I have to mention the 'subplot' which is the reading of that very story in modern times: Duke, a man played by James Garner, retells the story to an older and distinguished woman (Rowlands). We quickly understand that they're the older version of Allie and Noah and Duke's devotion is inspiring: asked to get back home by his family, he retorts; ""this is my sweetheart here"". The act he pulls everyday wishing for only five minutes of remembrance is worth the effort, wasn't he the same fiery romantic fellow who wrote 365 letters to his sweetheart?You got it ""The Notebook"" is romantic, it's perhaps the most assumedly romantic film of the last years, it has passion, furor, arguments, sensuality, sex, hell, it even has hesitations. For once I was happy to see a character struggling and incapable to make the right choices, I was glad that the first sex scene wasn't exactly an apotheosis. Ryan Gosling is strangely hypnotic as the eternal dreamer crazy enough to build his dream house and refusing to sell it even for twice its value. And Rachel MacAdams is the perfect counterpart as the spoiled brat who can both jump to his arms or hit him on the shoulders because he's only telling the truth. Both form a wonderful pair and the performances of Garner and Rowlands allow us to consider that the passing of ages can dilute the zest of passion but never at the expenses of true complicity.The film features many great-looking shots showing the bucolic and postcard-like beauty of the South: rivers, lakes, forest, majestic house with obsolete charm. And in one of these natural spots of beauty, you have that passionate kiss under the rain, certainly one of the most romantic movie moments ever. Directed by Rowland's son, Cassavetes brings the best out of his mother without overexploiting the emotions as his father did. This restraint pays off in making the emotional breakdown extremely powerful with Garner's tearful reaction. Watching a man cry always gets me anyway.But maybe I wish the film could have stopped right after we saw Duke holding the notebook. I'm not sure the film needed these last five minutes where it lingered on the whole hospital ambiance. Sometimes, it's better to let the audience figure out what would happen next and the last scene, as powerful as it was, was too on-the-nose for me, maybe it was the one drop too many, romantically speaking.After watching the film, I called my friend... but that's another story.",The Notebook
28,MOscarbradley,Dire,2,15 June 2006,"Ryan Gosling is far too good an actor for this mawkish rubbish about young love and old love and eternal love. I knew things were bad when I started admiring the ducks on the lake. Gosling is the boy from the wrong side of the tracks who has a summer romance with rich girl Rachel McAdams, (who has the kind of face you are unlikely to remember from one movie to the next). They lose each other and just as predictably find each other again and all the time nice old codger James Garner tells the story of their 'great' love to Gena Rowlands who has senile dementia. No brownie points for filling in the gaps.Rowlands is sensational considering she doesn't have anything to do but look vacant and Joan Allen is simply brilliant as McAdams' rich bitch of a mother. The fact that Allen is one of the best actresses in America helps. She can rise above the most mediocre of material and this is truly mediocre; appallingly scripted, indifferently directed and if a few members of the cast are giving it more than it's worth, they can still hardly be said to be redeeming the material.",The Notebook
29,MLDinTN,Entertaining tale of true love,10,20 June 2005,"This was a very underrated film because I never even heard of it till I saw it on cable. It's about a story of true love. Nick and Ally get together while her family is on vacation. Her parents don't approve of Nick, mainly because he isn't rich like them. They go back home and Ally's mom aides in keeping the two apart. So years pass, and they finally see each other again. Each is involved with someone else but not yet married. It doesn't take long for them to start up an affair. Destiny brings the two together as how it should be. Neither were as happy in their other relationships as they were together.This movie was better than most because it was told wonderfully and didn't have a lot of bad dialog or unbelievable plot twists. I don't rate many films a 10.FINAL VERDICT: I recommend this for anyone looking for a romantic film and even if you aren't, I'd still check it out. It's that good.",The Notebook
30,g-bodyl,Perhaps the Greatest Love Story of Our Generation!,9,17 October 2014,"As a guy, I generally try to stay away from Nicholas Sparks movies because they seem too schmaltzy and tripe for my taste. I do have a sweet spot for romance, but just not in these kind of films. Then I was forced to watch this film, The Notebook. I'm glad I did because this is the greatest love story of my generation perhaps only rivaling Titanic (please don't judge me.) This period piece also features memorable characters whom truly draw you in and I also mention this has one of the greatest film endings in cinema history and one that made the film even more remarkable. There are some clichés to be had, but in the end the film is just a simple love story.This film starts off in modern day at a nursing home with this elderly man named Duke reading a romance story to a female patient. This story is about how a working class man named Noah who falls in love with a girl named Allie, a girl from the elite class. Despite their social differences, they spend every day together. But they end up separating anyhow because of their different statuses. But seven years later, fate has them meeting up again but this time under different scenarios.This film is well-acted by everyone. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams make a magnificent pair together on-screen and this movie is responsible for their stardom. There are good supporting turns by Sam Shepard as Noah's supportive father and Joan Allen as Allie's cold, stern mother. But we cannot miss the performances of the great James Garner as Duke and Gena Rowland as the female patient.Overall, Nick Cassevete directed a magnificent romance film and from what I heard, the best book-to-screen adaptation of Nicholas Sparks. This film is also realistic as it effectively shows what history was like and how social interactions changed over the past seventy years. I may have to check out more Sparks films, but I'm sure they are not even close to living up to the Notebook. And yes, I nearly cried at certain points. I rate this film 9/10.",The Notebook
31,CuriosityKilledShawn,Who doesn't like a love story?,8,31 January 2005,"I must stress to you my belief in that the 'romantic comedy' is pretty much the worst creation of mankind. Some may argue that religion or the atom bomb are more destructive but the romcom (ugh!) is consistent proof that the public are idiots willing to fork over cash multiple times for the same old, same old crap. We very rarely get a sincere romance film, they kinda died out in the forties and have struggled for breath since.I liked A Walk to Remember a lot and felt obliged to check this out (because it's from a book by the same writer). That obligation turned out to be quite rewarding as this sober, mature film was everything zillion dollar attempts to make us cry (I'm subtly referencing Pearl Harbor) were not. It's all about character and the guts and imagination to tell a good story.Noah is a simple 17-year-old lumberyard worker. He's cocky, arrogant but very good-natured and he quickly attaches himself to Allie, a girl from the city, from Old Money and a fussy family who condemn her relationship with Noah. This is all told in flashback as old Noah (James Garner) reads from his book of youthful memories. Yes, this part is nothing original but the conviction by the cast make it astonishingly real and believable. The performances all round (but especially from Gosling and Rachel McAdams) give The Notebook a strong edge over most attempts at romance. You can literally feel their urge for each other and are involved with them all the way. 'Will she or won't she' plot lines have been done to agonising death so credit must be given Nick Cassavetes (who you'll probably best remember as Castor Troy's bald pal from Face/Off) for pulling it off so eloquently.I strongly recommend that you give The Notebook a try. Even if your a hardened 300-pound muscle-man who's afraid to love it's still worth it. But I must warn you, if your the kind of person who breaks down in uncontrollable crying at the end of Bicentennial Man (err...) you must know that The Notebook ends very similarly. So if your lip quivers easily, watch it alone.The DVD is in gorgeous-looking 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen that perfectly shows off the wonderful cinematography and warm color pallet of the film. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is most unsophisticated but considering the nature of the film, that is to be expected. Extras include, 2 Commentaries by director Nick Cassavetes and writer Nicholas Sparks, 12 Deleted Scenes, featurettes on Cassavetes and Sparks, 'Locating The Notebook' Featurette, Casting Noah and Allie Featurette, Rachel McAdams Screen Test and the Trailer.",The Notebook

33,F Gwynplaine MacIntyre,Milk of amnesia,3,13 December 2004,"SPOILERS THROUGHOUT. 'The Notebook' is the 17,329,587th movie about a woman choosing between a reliable steady guy who sincerely loves her and a macho jerk. It's also the 17,329,587th movie in which (big surprise!) she chooses the macho jerk, and we're supposed to applaud that decision. This movie's one slight twist in the moss-encrusted formula is a flashback framing device, which supposedly makes it more difficult for us in the present to guess which choice she made in the 1950s.Gena Rowlands (who pronounces it 'jenna') plays a woman with Alzheimer's Movie disease, which is different from real-life Alzheimer's disease because it only makes her forget things in the service of the plot line. Real-life Alzheimer's patients, tragically, forget their toilet-training and stuff like that. Gena Rowlands is all glammed-up here, remembering everything except minor details like which man she married. When the script calls for her to have a convenient resurgence of memory, here it comes bang on schedule. When the script calls for an equally convenient loss of the same memory, there it goes.Due to the flashback structure, the major roles are split between young actors (playing the leads in the 1940s and '50s) and senior-citizen actors as the same characters in the present. Gena Rowlands shares her role with the much younger Rachel McAdams as Allie Hamilton. Unfortunately, Ms McAdams has two very prominent birthmarks which have no counterparts on Ms Rowlands ... making Allie Hamilton the world's only woman whose body has FEWER spots as she gets older.There is anachronistic dialogue in the flashback scenes. The 1940s sequences are production-designed within an inch of their lives, but they don't look like the actual 1940s. Everything is too bright, too colourful, with no sense of wartime shortages or rationing. As usual in Hollywood movies, we get the past as Hollywood *wants* it to be, not the past as it actually was. I cringed during one scene in an upscale nightclub in the southern United States in the 1940s, in which an African-American bandleader grins his approval while black and white couples share the dance floor. There may have been a few lower-class roadhouses in the Jim Crow south where the races mingled, but it did *not* happen in upper-class establishments like the one shown here!Noah Calhoun, the macho jerk, not only places himself in danger but also endangers everybody else (first on a ferris wheel, then by grabbing the brake of a bus while it's in motion), and we're meant to admire this guy. Later, in the 1950s, he sports an incredibly ridiculous sensitive-guy beard that's right out of the 1980s or later. Any white man who wore a beard like this in the southern United States in the 1950s would have been carried out of town on a rail.Sam Shepard does his usual posturing and preening. James Garner plays the older version of one of the two rivals for Allie's affection, and we're not supposed to know whether she chose irresponsible jerk Noah or steady reliable Lon. Sorry, but movie heroines always make that choice the same way, so the suspense level is zero.I will give director Nick Cassavetes some credit: he's actually interested in telling a story about human interaction, unlike his father John Cassavetes who specialised in pretentious acting-school exercises in which nothing ever happened. Unfortunately, the story in 'The Notebook' is a very predictable one. This movie is soppy, sloppy, floppy and choppy. I'll rate it 3 points out of 10.",The Notebook
34,vincentlynch-moonoi,"Boy, was I wrong",7,15 April 2013,"I really didn't expect to like this movie. I didn't particularly like the cast, particularly Ryan Gosling and James Garner. And I sort of expected it to be a juvenile tale of young love.Well, it is a tale of young love, but told in a very mature manner...and in a way that shows that all endings are not happy...yet in their own way can be fulfilling. And that alone earned it some extra stars in my eyes.As time has gone by, I've begun to realize that I have to re-examine Ryan Gosling. He's not an actor I want to like, and I'm not enamored with several of the films he's selected, but every time I've watched one of his films, I've been impressed. And as much here, as anywhere.I was also not very familiar with Rachel McAdams...but wow! She's tremendous as the young seventeen year old girl! I never cared much for James Garner...oh, an occasional role here and there. In this film he was charming, and perfect for the role as the story teller. But...I did have a little difficulty seeing him as the old Ryan Gosling...physically I can see no resemblance whatsoever. That was distracting.I have never seen Gena Rowlands (as the old lady) more beautiful and poignant. Joan Allen is, in my view, a much underrated actress, and I wish we saw much more of her. More and more I see James Marsden as a dependable ""sleeper"" of an actor whom I respect. The one real casting error, from my perspective, was David Thornton, whom I just can't see as the father of the young lady.A remarkably good and sensitive film. Highly recommended, and I bet it's found a spot on many a home's DVD shelf.",The Notebook
35,ironhorse_iv,"If you're a bird, I'm a bird. I like flying with the Notebook. It's a good movie.",8,29 June 2014,"Come fly with the Notebook. Directed by Nick Cassavetes and based on the novel of the same name by Nicholas Sparks. The movie is about Duke (James Garner) an elderly man, trying to re-spark the memory of his dementia suffering love one, (Gena Rowlands) by using a notebook about a young couple love affair during one summer in 1940. It's here, the movie flashback from present day to 1940, where we're introduce to worker man, Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) and heiress Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams) trying to work out, their own relationship. While, it's not a healthy relationship like the novel. The chemistry between them are pretty good, when you get to see them as being a lovely couple. The movie still has more arguing and fighting then love scenes. It's a bit overwhelming, but without conflict, it would be a really boring chick flick. It kinda hurt the film, but kinda doesn't in a way. First off, both people really put each other in danger. The first bad sign was when Noah climbed up on that Ferris Wheel and threatened to kill himself by letting go if she didn't go out with him. Sure, it seems cute in the movie, but imagine if a guy did that in real life. You would be calling 911, thinking he's a psychopath. Honestly, he almost get her run over by a car by lying in the street. That's a sign of unstable, ladies. I have to give props to Ryan Gosling for making these scenes, more charming like a crazy lover, than crazy stalker. Also, Allie is no Southern Peach here, too. She's abandon him multiples times, beat him with slapping him in the face or punching his chest and cheats on her current boyfriend, Lon (James Marsden). At less, the movie doesn't make them too unlikeable. The relationship here, is way more realistic than the unrealistic cheese in the novel. The supporting cast is alright, but they're so clichés characters like the mother (Joan Allen). It's so generic, to have a mother that doesn't want her to date this guy in these films. At less, I have to say, Joseph Stalin mustache, Allie's dad (David Thornton) was pretty cool. Also, James Marsden has to be the most typecast actor for the role of woman cheats on her current boyfriend for a much hotter guy. This guy doesn't get a break! The writing is pretty clichés archetypical story of the Boy Meets Girl. Examples of this, are with establish scenes like kissing the rain, romantic boat rides, and others. Honestly, the things trying to pull them apart is ridiculous unrealistic and could had been solved. It felt really dumb. Like why Noah couldn't go to New York? He's alright with going to a new city with his friend, Fin. (Kevin Connolly), but not with Allie? Also, how on earth, Allie's mother, able to gather all her mail, if Noah wrote that much letters. You would thought, for one whole year, Allie might beat her mother to the mailbox, at less once. Also, it's not uncommon to people to call other people back in those days. The only thing that could make sense, is World War 2, but they really pan over it, quickly. It's ends as fast as it started in the film. Honestly, if they kept the WW2 part, going longer. It would make a way better pull apart conflict. Instead, the movie really misused that. The twist in the end, wasn't really much of a twist as the movie kinda hints at it, 2/4 in. The cinematography is pretty good for the film. Still, the director hits you over the head with a bird metaphor. It's everywhere, here. Enough with the birds! The movie really does look like it takes place in the 1940s, but like any movie in the places, there are some historic inaccuracies. I do love the references to 'Leaves of Grass' by Whit Whitman. It's themes of faith and fate in the poem, """"Song of Myself,"" are two topics serve to foreshadow future revelations in later parts of the film. Glad, it's not a throw-away line as it brought up multiples time in the film. Noah's love for poetry, music, and the outdoors all play important roles in The Notebook, not only adding interest to a number of scenes but also deepening Noah as a character. The biggest different between the book and the film is the fact, that Allie didn't write a notebook at all. It's seem like Noah wrote the notebook, but it's not really mention. The best thing that made this movie really good is the theme of love conquer all, when Alzheimer is a setback. This part, made the movie so watchable. While, the ending is bittersweet. It was a better way to end the movie, then the novel. The movie being PG-13, didn't really hurt the film. It does show that you can still show a great sex scene without one shot of nudity. The violence is pretty tame, as the WW2 years are passed over, quickly. I can say, this movie works better than a lot of modern young adult novels. Overall: The Notebook isn't anything new, if you follow chick flick movies, or know anything about romantic novels. The one thing that made this movie really good is the struggle of remembering love ones. That is the backbone of the story. It's the reason, why this movie works.",The Notebook
36,paulclaassen,"Overrated and insanely annoying, this was one of the most unromantic 'love stories' I've ever seen...",2,22 April 2019,"Hailed as one of the great love stories, I finally decided to give it a go. Not even 20 minutes into the movie I was tempted to hit EJECT. I should have. The film became more and more annoying as it progressed. Noah (Gosling) and Allie (McAdams)'s meeting was anything but romantic. Noah was the most forward, cocky, obnoxious, persistent character I've seen in a while. Oh, and I think the intention was for him to be charming...(??!!).The love birds were fighting all the time and they were the most incompatible lovers I've seen on screen. There were simply no chemistry between them. The falling in love set-up as well as the meeting of the family scenes were so similar to 'Titanic'. In fact, the film would eventually become nothing more than a 'Titanic' meets 'Pearl Harbor' film - only much, much more boring with nothing interesting happening except for the couple fighting all the time. Yawn.There was simply NOTHING romantic about their relationship. They did and said the most preposterous things! I mean, honestly! I also didn't find anything in the film justified. Everything simply happened for the sake of creating an epic, somber, tragic love story. I mean, did Noah honestly expect Allie to sit around waiting for him for years and years?? And how is it romantic when they have sex during a moment of lust while she is engaged to be married to another man whom she proclaims to love?This was the most unromantic, most annoying love story I've seen in a while. Credit where credit is due, though. The cinematography was really great. Joan Allen was very good as Allie's mom (although she was very similar to Maggie Smith as Rose's mom in 'Titanic'). Oh, and notice how Allie's ward in the Care Centre is called the Rose Ward!!Next! (I'd rather watch Titanic again...)",The Notebook
37,Floated2,"When things settle in, they click",8,14 July 2017,"The Notebook has been considered for many one of the more best selling Nicholas Sparks adaptation films within the last decade and one of the more polarizing romance films. Opening back in 2004, the film was not as much of a hit back then but quickly became to be a bigger film as the years have passed. The first half of the film is quite shaky as we see the introductions of the characters, and the story settling in. We watch it, knowing it must get better and as the second half approaches (about an hour in- once we see Ryan Goslin's character Noah with a beard), the film picks up a lot of momentum and becomes very entertaining and quite a thrilling watch. We can see why this movie has been praised by film goers through the years, though it does have its clichés although they do not get too much in the way of the story. Although predictable (as are most love stories), what works about the Notebook is the ending and the way the film is told within it's storytelling.This film has been described by many as ""The Titanic"" of the 2000's, and that may be accurate as far as best selling/romance love adaptation book stories. Overall depending on your expectations, this film may not be as cheesy or lovey as one would expect. The chemistry and performances of the leads, along with the storytelling is what set this film apart from other films of the genre.",The Notebook
38,filipemanuelneto,"Another ultra-romantic movie with a forbidden love story. The good acting make it interesting, but almost everything else is quite ordinary.",4,13 September 2019,"This is the typical dramatic novel that comes out of the mind of Nicholas Sparks, the young teen's favorite author. The story tells the romance between Noah, a young poor man, and Allie, the daughter of wealthy parents who do not approve of this dating and decide to marry her with someone with more money. Their love story began in 1940 and continued through time, coming to us through the mouth of an old man, who reads an old diary to an equally old lady, who is already suffering from dementia.Usually, sugary and melodramatic novels are not to my liking but this movie has been reasonably digestible, largely due to the satisfactory performance of the main cast. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams were able to create a good chemistry together, and that went into the scenes where they are together. There are some dialogues between them that are so sugary that they seem to have been taken from a Brazilian soap opera, but the actors commitment is genuine. Gena Rowlands gave life to an elderly Allie quite well, but it was even better to see the performance of charismatic James Garner as old Noah.Nick Cassavetes has done a satisfactory job as director, keeping a good pace and achieving a serious, elegant and balanced end product. The soundtrack is quite good, taking good advantage of the rhythms in vogue in the Forties and Fifties. Photography and filming is regular, denoting careful post-production and editing work.Although this movie sometimes exaggerates in romance and sugar, and it pisses me off a little, its usually a satisfying movie, that gives us an interesting, though very common, love story, very similar to a million of forbidden love affairs already told in soap operas, leaflet novels, cheap literature and B-movies.",The Notebook
39,leplatypus,Sparks is on fire (DVD),7,25 November 2005,"This my second unintentional adaptation of this writer. After the wonderful ""Walk to remember"", it is a confirmation of his talent for true love story...The key of the movie is so true that every body will recognize its simplicity of genius: Lovers write the story of the passion to leave a testimony against the time and their loss of memory (a bit like my motivation behind my IMDb reviews...) If the idea is brilliant, remain for a movie to find the best actors and a real chemistry between them. For that, the cast is excellent. The young couple is unknown people (but future breakout...) whereas the old couple is Hollywood stars. It is one of few movies where i can find the same intensity & passion in same characters played by different people. And if there are ""clichés"" or ""deja-vu"" situations, they appear close to truth...So, as in ""Walk to remember"", you just follow those incredible characters in their so simple and so moving story. When the guy asks what the girl does for herself, for freedom, well, this is for me like he has touched the very sense of life...As the locations and the reconstitution of the 40's are opulent, there's absolutely nothing wrong in this movie.So, make you a moment of freedom: watch this movie, go read a Sparks' novel and write the story of your love for your soul-mate....",The Notebook

41,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Romance executed at its finest: Beautiful images, beautiful story",8,10 March 2009,"There is no brighter gem in movies than a love story told right. That is ""The Notebook."" Romance is central to hundreds of thousands of films, but few are told as well as this film tells it. Between Nicholas Sparks' heart-wrenching story, director Nick Cassevetes' attention to setting and mood and the acting brilliance and universally good looks of Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, a bigger emotional punch is hard to come by.The film is a period romance taking place in the late 1930s and 40s about a teenage couple that meet and fall in love over a summer. It is told to us by Duke (James Gardner) as he reads it from a notebook to an old woman living in an elderly care facility. Noah (Gosling) and Allie (McAdams) are from two different backgrounds: Noah is a working class guy living by his means and Allie's parents are loaded. Despite their undeniably chemistry they split ways after the summer. Although their lives take off in different directions, you can tell they're destined to come back into each other's lives.A good love story draws you in to the main relationship, connects to you emotionally some way. ""The Notebook"" does this in numerous ways. The first is, well, the attractiveness of Gosling and McAdams. They are beautiful human creatures and their chemistry is impeccable both physically and in terms of their acting. They also have a believable romance, which the entire film hinges on. They actually act like young people in love do. Anyone who has been in love will identify with their relationship: the constant affection, the silliness -- even the fighting. It's incredibly honest and though the script isn't immaculate, all those other elements cover up the rough patches of dialogue, which the usual cheesy romance never accomplishes.Cassevetes plays a crucial role adding beauty to the film. Working with French cinematographer Robert Fraisse, each scene has distinct colors, beginning with the rich red of the opening sequence that more or less tells you everything you need to know about the film without more than a line of dialogue. The way the love scenes are lit and the way the outdoors scenes are full of life bring out the tenderness and the youthful energy of Noah and Allie's romance and their re-connection.Romance is about execution, finding a way to avoid clichés or create an emotional pull so strong that clichés seem to evaporate seconds after they happen. Despite its reputation as the chick flick of all chick flicks, just try not feeling invested in what's going on and caring about what happens to the characters. It's hard.",The Notebook
42,lisafordeay,Based off a novel of the same name The Notebook is one of my new favourite movies to watch,10,4 August 2013,"The Notebook is based off a Nicholas Sparks novel(so technically this is going to be a tearjearker as some of his novels get turned into movies like A Walk To Remember,Dear John,The Lucky One,and The Last Song with Miley Cyrus and her real life boyfriend/fiancé ex Liam Hemsworth).The story of The Notebook is about an elderly couple both played tremendously well by James Garner( and no his not related to Jennifer Garner btw)and Gena Rowlands who live in a Nursing Home together as Rowlands' charcther has Dementia,and Garner's charcther has heart problems. Every day he reads his wife a story about this young couple called Noah and Allie(both played by Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams) who are sorta like Romeo and Juliet. They fall in love at first sight when Noah met her at a carnival and wanted Allie to go out on a date with him and she wouldn't but she then accepted,Allie's parents are stuck up millionaires who thinks Noah is trash and not perfect for their daughter(especially her mother who is a real pain in the butt),and of course both Allie and Noah break up for a while only for faith to bring them back together again.A year or a few months later and Allie is now engaged to some pilot played by an unrecognizable James Marsden(from Enchanted and 27 Dresses)who was injured when he met Allie working at the Hospital where she is qualified as a nurse.So what does Noah and Allie's story have in common with James and Gene's charcthers????WARNING THIS IS A SPOILER DO NOT READ ON ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT THIS TO GET RUINED.It is later revealed that the elderly couple are actually Noah and Allie (as Allie had a notebook that she wrote before her dementia got worse) and she wanted Noah to read it to her. Sadly the two passed away side by side together showing the audience how loyal they were together.Bottom line: When I first saw this on TV I thought I wasn't going to like it so when I got this for a bargain in Golden Discs for 6 Euro,I had to get my hands on it because I'm a sucker for a good romantic drama and my favourite romantic drama of all time has to be(actually I have two; Titanic and A Walk To Remember because they both got incredible stories and the cast was brilliant in both films).Here its the same: The cast was brilliant especially James Garner,Gene Rowlands,Rachel McAdams,and Ryan Gosling,the story was so beautifully well told,even the setting was great as its set in 1940s America during the War. The music was depressing as hell,but hey it has to have depressing music since after all this is a tearjearker(so you have been warned,if you are up for a great love story since Titanic then look no further with this film).Overall: The Notebook is a heartbreaking love story about a low class boy and a high up girl who are thrown together by chance and fall in love with each other.Bottom line I have nothing bad to say about it other than the depressing music but for that its a 10/10.",The Notebook
43,Polaris_DiB,Character issues...,7,10 February 2006,"I think, for me, this movie can illustrate some of the difficulties in creating a romance drama that is very effective. This movie is a finely crafted and beautiful work of art. The story and the film-making are keen on providing a sense of profound happiness and energy into the concept of love, one that is both healing and outgoing.However, some various problems arose for me with the exposition of the characters. I was simply not attracted to either of the characters. They got together too quickly, too loudly, and from there I couldn't really feel love for them even though I could feel their love for each other. Does this fall into personal taste, or does this fall into shortcomings of the story? Well let's take a look, for a moment, at how they got together, that scene with the ferris wheel. It was loud, it was out there, and it was pretty obnoxious, honestly. Does it connect with us, the viewers, at a level where Noah's actions are reflections of what we secretly desire to do, to climb and to jump and to yell and to make sure she promises to notice us at all costs? Or is it simply brash and contrived, a character that is so outgoing that he represents anybody who is impulsive, albeit completely honest about his feelings and completely persistent in his emotions? Or Allie, is she honestly someone that guys would fall in love with, the person we can imagine as ""The One?"" Of course at this point somebody will probably think I'm reading too much into them, or I'm just not accepting the movie for what it is, or anything along that line, but in the nature of film criticism I want to ask, what is the purpose of movies like these? As an entertainment medium, it connects us with the idea of ""love"", the one, the search for that precise person that the two characters find in each other that loves each other and can love forever, something that is needed especially since the world gets so cynical now.So why am I just completely not in love with those characters? It's a good movie. What I liked especially were the opening shots and that entire scene involving the swans and the rain, which were indeed very romantic. The story was very touching. I just didn't like the characters. I think the real dilemma is that they had too much dialog. Sometimes they spoke when honestly they should have been a bit quieter; and I'm not talking about the first sex scene. That scene was actually one of the movie's strongest moments, one that was more honest about the anxieties for those two young lovers and the implications of what they were doing. I'm talking about moments in the film where all the characters needed to do was share a look, and instead they shared some dialog and it brought me away from the idea that they were truly connected on a deeper level.--PolarisDiB",The Notebook
44,meeza,Chic Flick is the subject of this Notebook,8,25 April 2005,"Go inside your bedroom, now move over to the cabinet, open the last drawer, and reach for that handkerchief. Why you ask? Because it's going to come in handy when you watch the romantic tearjerker ""The Notebook"". So are you ready to take notes? Here we go: ""The Notebook"" is the poster film of chic flicks for 2004. Ryan Gosling as Noah and Rachel Mcadams as Allie star as young lovers who must overcome obstacles to survive their romance: poor boy/rich girl dilemma, boy has cool dad and girl has overprotective mom, boy goes to war/girl goes to pray. Yea, we have seen these formulaic concepts before, but take note of this, they are presented by Director Nick Cassavetes as more of an instrumental plight then a serendipity fluffy ingredient. The story is told by older Noah to the older Allie, who suffers from a degenerate Alzheimer's condition, in hopes of getting her to remember their unforgettable love. That's it, reach for that handkerchief. James Garner did garner a S.A.G. Best Supporting Actor nom for his heartwarming performance as the older Noah. Gena Rowlands as the older Allie was no match for Garner but it was sporadically tender. However, she crawled up the wrong allie when it came to match Garner's magnanimity. Cassavates, who is Rowland's real life son, did execute a credible job with the festooning and amour of ""The Notebook"". Several scenes were of cinematography perfection by Robert Fraisse. His ""Fraisse"" frames were breathtaking. However, what binded me the most of ""The Notebook"" was the emotional breakthrough performance of Rachel Mcadams. I wonder if there is more talent in ""The Mcadams Family"". OK guys! Final Notes! If you request a movie to get your gals all romantic & horny then ""The Notebook"" gets straight lays, I mean straight A's, in that department. **** Good",The Notebook
45,CubsandCulture,A mixed bag-parts of it are aggressively ill-conceived.,7,21 August 2020,"The period romantic melodrama sections of this film really work. Gosling and McAdams are well matched. The script finds some unique story beats-the traffic light scene, the restoration of the house etc.-while conforming to a star cross lovers story. The love triangle doesn't feel forced and Marsden is a good foil for Gosling. I liked the direction and the over visual vibe of the film. I didn't particularly care for the framing device.The decision to tell the story in flashback as a way of jogging the memory of dementia patient is ill-conceived. It introduces the possibility-which doesn't belong in this sort of story-that Noah is gaslighting Allie. I am aware that we are meant to take the flashbacks to have been written by Allie but we never actually see *that*. We only see the implication. Noah is shown to be grossly manipulated in the meeting scene-he threatens to kill himself if he doesn't get a date!-that this is not idle speculation. Moreover, the love triangle being about class-poor boy rich girl!-doesn't link up to dementia storyline all that well.This film would be better if a 1/3 of it was removed.",The Notebook

Even being familiar with the story I still found myself all caught up in Noah and Allie's star crossed lovers romance.

I think this might be one of the few adaptions where I actually like the movie better than the book too. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are perfect and give the characters such life, creating everlasting magic together. I can't imagine anyone else in those roles, and the chemistry, its no wonder that carried off screen for a time. Yup I fell a little in love with Ryan Gosling again myself.As a whole this is old fashioned storytelling.

I loved the chemistry between both Garner and Rowlands and between Gosling and McAdams. Their on screen love really does win the viewer over. The movie brings you into their story and all the complexities of it and makes you care about what happens to them in the end.

So last evening we watched her DVD of THE NOTEBOOK. It stars Rachel McAdams and Sam Shepard.

Problems arise when the girl's parents feel the boyfriend is not the best choice for her. So she finds another boyfriend. But her first lover doesn't give up... and then... I did not hate the film. Actually, even though it's mostly predictable and it's typical of millions of other chick flicks like it, I did appreciate the way it was structured. It's a story set in the 1940s that's told in flashback from a 2004 hospital as an elderly man (James Garner) reads the story to an old woman suffering from Alzheimer's (Gena Rowlands). The revelation here was not unpredictable either from the get go, but the film itself doesn't make a mystery out of it by the midway point anyway.

50,aharmas,In an intimate epic with a tender heart,10,18 March 2007,"As another proof that some of the recent award recipients have nothing to do with quality, here comes an assured and delicate piece of film-making that will probably not be honoured in the fair manner it deserves in next year's awards' frenzy. Just the other night, I had the pleasured to see an accomplished film for the second time: ""Inside Man"", and my jaw dropped when I realized that it was mysteriously absent in any ""best of"" celebrations. Regardless of what happens in about one year, audiences should not deny themselves the transcendental experience from seeing a movie that recognizes the beauty inside families and how their relationships are a mixture of inner and external pressures; only to all boil down to one word: Love.As the title indicates, most of the storyline originates from a very peculiar name, and how it seems to affect the main protagonist. As the plot unfolds, we become involved in a sophisticated, almost flawless, and touching, without being maudlin masterpiece. With stunning camera work, a spiritual and moving score, and astounding performances by the entire cast, we learn to identify the universal values that this marvelous film highlights.What is truly miraculous in the film is how its director weaves a story from the incongruities between two cultures that couldn't be any more different from each other, and yet, they are mirror reflections of each other. We all cry, feel happiness and disappointment. As our characters grow and change, we feel their sense of wonder, joy, and grief. Seeing them celebrate breaks down any resistance we might have to whatever foreign quality this movie might be. It's exotic, inviting, showing us that we share more than we think. In ""The Namesake"", a Russian name becomes essential to some of the tribulations of a Hindu American young man. It anchors the love that originates between a mother and her children. As Ashima adjusts to her new surroundings, she manages to hold on her traditions, as she learns to cope with the changes that she can't stop. In the end, she delivers one of the most inspirational speeches in movie history, and we can't do nothing but witness a superb dramatic performance come full circle. Many in Hollywood might feel a tinge of envy as her is an actress that charms us in spite of apparently not trying very hard. Her character is lovely, strong, and sometimes reads like a collection of the best moments in every female great role in the last century. She embodies the best of Scarlett O'Hara, the pain and frustration of Sophie in ""Sophie's Choice"", some of the regal qualities of Helen Mirren in ""The Queen"", and she can even sing and makes us laugh, all when a screenplay that addresses the lives of one regular family in New York.""The Namesake"" deserves every single of the kudos people decide to give it. It's a brilliant film, based on an outstanding piece of fiction, and that one that never struggles to be anything else but faithful to its source material, and whose heart never stops beating, with a real and magnificent heart.Run and enjoy some of the best moments of your life.",The Notebook
51,aidanratesmovies,Absolutely Beautiful,10,12 June 2020,"Incredibly beautiful, detailed, and stunningly emotional- The Notebook may have some formulaic issues, but is able to overcome them and prove itself to be a very unique and brilliant picture. The film is full of very lively and fantastic performances, most notably Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams who are absolutely perfect in their roles. Their chemistry on screen is amazing, and the even more surprising part of it is that they had a hard time getting along at first, both as characters and in real life. The cinematography in the film is often brilliant, and at its best, absolutely gorgeous. The direction is also quite good, surprising for this type of film, and goes to show where good direction could lead you in a film that can feel so much weaker without it. Luckily, the film is strongly lead, both directionally and through the actors on the screen, to make for a truly impactful and unforgettable love story that i'm sure will be cherished for years to come. The music in the film is very good as well, as well as the atmosphere in the film, and the feel in the film overall is continually impressive. At it's worse, the film can be a bit predictable and formulaic- containing a few tropes that you have seen in countless romantic films before. However, it doesn't impact the film too much, and for the most part it still remains an endlessly entertaining and beautiful time. In the end, The Notebook is a surprisingly special film- that is nearly perfect except when it decides to play it too safe. It's direction is impressive, as well as its lead performances from Gosling and McAdams, and its overall cinematography and feel is endlessly beautiful.

I'm glad to say that knowing what's coming, helped a little bit and I had tissues to hand just in case.It's a charming story of love and the problems that arise from it. It doesn't end well for everybody, but it's the kind of love we're all looking for. I want to get caught in the rain and snog the face of my forever love. WHERE'S MY MOVIE ROMANCE GODAMMIT??? But I digress.The actors all do a great job and Ryan is incredibly cute at the beginning, how could she even think of turning him down, but then there's James M later on and it would be a tough call to decide between the two.

55,triple8,magnificent,9,22 October 2005,"SPOILERS ALL THROUGH: The Notebook may leave one speechless after watching it. This movie was one of the best love stories I've ever seen. I was so moved by it, I watched it a second time shortly after seeing it for the first time. The Notebook was absolutely outstanding and without a doubt one of the best love stories I've ever watched.The acting was of the highest caliber, the photography was gloriously stunning, and the story was so bittersweet and touching, it was almost to much so. For love story purists this movie's poignancy will envelop you. If one does not have a high tolerance for these types of films they should probably stay away.This movie has been compared to Love Story but I Happened to have enjoyed The Notebook a lot more. The main negative is it is almost to bittersweet. It is draining and exhausting to watch but the film maintained an old style quality that makes it seem like this should have come out many years ago. It is unique and an instant classic. These days, a movie like this just doesn't come around to often. Judging from both the critical and viewer acclaim this film has received, maybe more of these types of films should come around.There is nothing I can say to do justice to the performers who went above and beyond mere excellence. If I could only pick one performer to give an award to, however, it would have to be James Garner. Was he even nominated? His performance was pure, powerful and flawless. It Was as Oscar worthy as anyone's I've ever seen and I think this movie should have been nominated as well as all of the four main Performers.The Notebook is sweet and nostalgic. It's also powerful, luminescent, graceful and visually lovely. It also contains one of the most powerful endings I have ever seen, and that's no exaggeration. Again-if one is not a fan of this genre they should stay away but for fans of romantic dramas, this one is a must see. The Notebook is an utterly magnificent film.",The Notebook
56,Seraphion,Really enjoyed this romance movie,8,31 August 2014,"The story weaves on while leaving breadcrumbs here and there, weaving back and forth between the old couple with the notebook, and the young couple's improbable love. The movie depicts one of so many Utopian conditions which broken hearted lovers would really prefer over their own sad endings. I really like Ryan Gosling's acting here. He can really maintain the calm character overall yet able to let go bursts of emotions. Rachel McAdams' performance provided the movie with the character in conflict well enough. But for me, I prefer that the character Allie can be played by other actresses who have more beautiful face than her. What's mentionable is that Gena Rowlands and James Garner, playing the older versions, can give acting performances which can balance what Gosling and McAdams have done and retained their characters. I like how this movie is even completed nicely even more with performance by Joan Allen, James Marsden, Sam Shepard, and Kevin Connolly",The Notebook
57,rosscinema,Sentimental love story works because of it's actors,7,30 November 2004,"I bash Hollywood all the time as they continually churn out formula films over and over again but every once in a while they make a sweet love story that for some reason or another works well. This clearly works and I think it's due to the performances of it's actors that obviously had good faith in the material. Story starts out in a nursing home where we see Noah ""Duke"" Calhoun (James Garner) who everyday reads to his wife Allie (Gena Rowlands) from his notebook about the story of how they met and fell in love. Allie is suffering from Alzheimer's and doesn't know that the story that is being read to her is actually her life but Duke hopes that it will start a spark where she will briefly remember their great romance.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Duke reads their story as it starts in the 1940's in North Carolina when as a young man (Ryan Gosling) he works in the saw mill but one night he meets a very pretty rich girl (Rachel McAdams) and begs her to go out with him. She does and they start dating until they both eventually fall head over heels in love but Allie's mother Anne (Joan Allen) wants her daughter to end her romance as she deems him lower class. Allie goes to school and doesn't hear from Noah but then the war breaks out and it takes a few years before they meet up again. By this time she's engaged but with their meeting they restart their torrid romance and must now ponder whether to get married or stay for good with Noah.This film is directed by Nick Cassavetes who is slowly learning how to be as terrific a director that his father was and with each film project he seems to be choosing material that is vastly different from each other. Here he tackles a sweet and sentimental love story and he does the right thing by staying close to the novel by Nicholas Sparks and assembling a great cast with his own mother in a pivotal role. Garner hasn't been in a role this good in eons and he's nothing short of moving here and I think this is the first time that he's actually cried in a performance. I was also deeply impressed by McAdams who I feel is a real emerging star and I do hope other well written roles come her way because she shows that she's ready. This film takes it's time telling it's story and it does tend to wander at certain points but this is a genuinely sweet and romantic film that is made with real care by it's young director and it's acted extremely well by the talented cast.",The Notebook
58,Galina_movie_fan,Here I am with a soaking handkerchief,8,4 May 2005,"""The Notebook"" (2004) has something absolutely amazing - the best on-screen chemistry between two young lovers who are crazy about each other, whose love is so real, so overwhelming, so tender and passionate that you actually forget that they are acting. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are sensational. Since I saw Ryan in his controversial ""The Believer"" (2001), I always wait for his next film. I believe that he's got a great future. McAdams was radiant- just to think that the first movie I saw her in was Rob Schneider's ""Hot Chick"" (yes, I rented it). Her work in ""The Notebook"" made me think that for many young (and not so young) artists the biggest problem is not the lack of talent but the chance to find the right material and the right director who can make the best of their abilities. I like the movie. I believe it deserves its tears. It really made me think of Woody Allen's words, ""If you want to make God laugh, tell him about your plans"". Even if the plans are as simple as to live happily ever after. 8/10",The Notebook

Do you think critics become too battle weary to see things with the wistful hope of improbable optimism? I'd forotten how young Rachel MacAdams and Ryan Gosling were when they made this movie. These two young Canadians won our hearts as they perfectly inhabited their characters. Their young love was filled with enthusiasm and life, yet, James Garner and Gena Rowlands beautifully displayed love, long lived. I love the writing, the performances, the locations and the music, that haunts us, even after the last scene fades. I'm a romantic that still dreams of endings such as this.

61,bobsgrock,A touching story.,7,19 February 2008,"The best part about The Notebook, just like Message in a Bottle and A Walk to Remember, is the story taken from a Nicholas Sparks novel. Sparks is so good at taking simple love stories and expanding them to mean so much to us that they become true tear-jerkers. While I didn't cry during this film, I was truly touched by the story of two people trying to come together with every obstacle imaginable trying to stop them. Ryan Gosling is strong as the head romantic man and Rachel McAdams is so beautiful and charming and lovable as Allie, it is hard to look at anything but her in every scene she is in. However, in my opinion, the young lovers' scenes don't compare to the power and emotion of those with James Garner and Gina Rowlands, playing the older Noah and Allie. As Allie got older, she began to lose her memory and now Noah is trying to help her remember who he is and what they used to have. The scene where she goes to a frightened rage because she doesn't know where she is is truly moving. Still, the best part is the last scene, where they die on the same bed together holding each other's hands. That is the perfect picture of true love. They had differences and complications, but they loved each other; it was that simple. It may not pack the emotional wallop some are looking for, but it is still a well-worthy film to see and one of the best love stories in modern film-making.",The Notebook
62,napierslogs,Love for the characters provides real emotion to the romantic drama,8,31 May 2011,"A love story for the ages; a weepy romantic drama; a timeless love story. All the exhausted clichés apply, but ""The Notebook"" manages to turn them into something substantial—emotionally at least, if not intellectually. Everything in this movie is beautiful and it's easy to get wrapped up into the story.Noah (Ryan Gosling) loves Allie (Rachel McAdams). That's basically the entire story, but conflicts arise when Allie's parents insist he's not good enough for her, and Noah has to spend the rest of his life winning her back. I love both Noah and Allie. Allie, because she's the type of girl that every girl can realistically see themselves as; she's emotional, but smart and passionate, and adorable in every way. And Noah, because he has this boyish charm that he never loses. Gosling has this incredible ability to play men at any and every point in their lives.Because the characters are just so captivating, the story is able to invoke emotion. You'll fall in love when they do, you'll be heart-broken when they are, and you'll cry when they do. ""The Notebook"" is beautifully shot, beautifully told, and most importantly, beautifully acted. And it's for those reasons that it is able to rise above the rather tired and painfully predictable plot. You won't even notice that because you'll be crying and falling in love.",The Notebook
63,film-critic,This movie brought to you by big business Kleenex!,3,16 February 2005,"I am of the utmost belief that Kleenex was a sponsor of this film. It has been a very long time since Hollywood released a ""true"" tearjerker film, and I know that Kleenex couldn't help but try to get a piece of the action. I know that my wife went through at least ten Kleenex by the time this film was over and she had read the book. Imagine what it would be like for those that didn't see this film coming. I honestly feel they could go through a whole box. Ironically, and corporately minded, I went through no Kleenex as I watched this film, but instead found my mind wandering and trying at any opportunity to search for any chemistry between our lovebird characters. From Garner and Rowlands to Gosling and McAdams, there was this sensation that they were nothing more than actors playing their part instead of the feeling of true love erupting from the screen. Adding to this mess was a mixed bag of story lines that seemed as if Cassavetes was trying to make straight lines out of circles. While this wasn't a horrible film by any means, The Notebook was perfect and its flaws cut very deep into this sad story.While I think Sparks' characters in his book are probably much better than in this story, I still wish he would have pushed harder for better actors or a bit more story. There definitely seemed to be a lacking on both of these ends that hurt the overall feel of the film. James Garner is old, and that was about the only thing that he had going for him. Rowlands I can give some credit towards, but strangely I couldn't see these two working together. Garner's passion towards Rowlands seems scripted, while there definitely wasn't anything between Rowlands and Garner. It felt as if Garner was working too hard while Rowlands just didn't place any effort. The Kleenex effect only occurred between these two characters, in my opinion, because they were old, and that seems to strike a chord with all of us. Perhaps it is the grandparent effect or the fear of getting to that point in our lives, I felt that tears were shed near the end of the film because of their age, not their acting ability. The same can be said for McAdams and Gosling. McAdams did a decent job with the material given, but the slipping accent of Ryan Gosling was inexcusable and disturbing. Gosling was completely miscast in this film. I don't know if he was Cassavetes first choice for the role, but he just didn't capture the emotions that were deeply rooted in this film. He read lines, gave some expression, but that was all. I saw Ryan Gosling playing the character and not Noah on screen. His eyes are what hurt him the most. They just didn't seem to fit with what the character was trying to convey. Each time the camera moved to his eyes, the film lost more credibility. To build a great film that this could have been you need to staple it with strong players, sadly, this did not happen with The Notebook. Feathers trying to be paperweights instead hold down this story.Then we have the story. Sparks has a great imagination, and this story seemed like it would make a great story to tell on the written page, but not in film. There were too many loose ends that were not covered or given enough respect for me in this film. Allie's parents are one of them. Allie's dad was hysterical looking as I kept hoping that I would see him whip out some Dapper Dan somewhere in the film. Allie's Mom, Joan Allen, is not given enough time to defend herself and her climactic moment at the end seems a bit forced and boring than emotional. We don't have enough information on her or this other character to really care about her big scene, instead it feels just like ""filler"". There should have been more with Sam Shepard, who conveniently did not make it till the end of the film. It felt as if he was written away because nobody knew what to do with him. The same can be said of James Marsden's character who arrives, conquers, and leaves with no emotional response. With many of these moments I felt we were given the short, short, short version instead of the emotional powerhouse this could have been. The final scene that I found myself laughing at immensely was the entire ""Noah going to war"" bit. The emotional scene during this brief interlude was completely forced and implausible. I needed more during this moment to have my heart wretched out of me, and not just a scene to tie up any loose ends. Cassavetes could handle this film, I think he just chose to throw too many elements into the fire that he could not fully develop, which hurt him in the long run.Overall, this film could have reached new levels, but instead cheapened itself to cater to those with low emotional control (the weepy) and lovers. Everyone in love has their own story to tell that would probably make another person tear up, but that is what makes it your own. Cassavetes did not build a strong film with The Notebook, but instead used common clichéd Hollywood techniques to give the audience what they were hoping for, shallow characters that will make you cry. Well, if you are looking for a film that literally cuts the drama and gives you the tears, this would be the film for you. To everyone else, I say skip it. There are better dramas that will burst your tear ducts longer than this one! Grade: ** out of *****",The Notebook
64,dglink,"""Iris"" Redux",6,24 July 2004,"One might categorize ""The Notebook"" as the ultimate ""chick flick"" since there is little in the story to appeal to male viewers.  Not much takes place that has not happened in dozens of other films.  A young man and a young woman meet, they fall in love, they face obstacles, they part, they... Well, if you have been to the movies sometime in the past 100 years, you can fill in the rest.  However, the movie does have a framing device that bears a striking resemblance to the recent bio film about writer Iris Murdoch, ""Iris.""  In the earlier film, however, the story balance was tilted towards the older characters, while in ""The Notebook,"" the younger players hold center stage.  The downbeat nature of ""Iris"" was bearable because of the towering performances of Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent.  Unfortunately, ""The Notebook"" is less distinguished.  While the older pair, Gena Rowlands and James Garner, are seasoned pros and do an able job, particularly Garner, the cast in the earlier scenes are just O.K., although paddling through a Disneyesque lake filled with thousands of white geese and keeping a straight face must require a great deal of acting discipline.  At times the entire film is as cloying as that treacly rippling-water scene despite desperate attempts to be moving and touching.  While ""Iris"" rose above its depressing subject matter with unforgettable performances that could break the heart of the most hardened stoic, ""The Notebook"" fails to evoke a single tear and turns a similar story into a sappy sentimental ""date film.""",The Notebook
65,Stampsfightclub,a realistic and dramatic portrayal of love,8,27 August 2008,"In an adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' novel, Ryan Gosling (Half Nelson) stars as Noah, a young man who falls in love with rich girl Allie, and the two embark on life together.Described by critics as one of the most romantic films in years, Nick Cassavetes romantic drama justifies the plaudits with a wonderful directed film about love and relationships, with heart-warming moments along with dramatic and humorous encounters.The story of the young couple is very sweet, if somewhat corny. Though with imperfections and complications along the way, the plot drives itself away from the norm, to deliver a sweet and realistic approach to relationships.The direction helps achieve a good realistic approach but also dives into a fantasy genre to, none more so than the rowing into the swan lake scene. This particular scene is really romantic and the direction and slow approach makes it feel like a complete romantic fantasy and will instantly make you smile, whatever age or gender you are.The acting by Gosling and McAdams (Mean girls) is a beautiful on screen partnership, which will make you really associate with their characters, but the pairing of Garner (Murphy's romance) and Rowlands (a woman under the influence) is one of the main reasons to watch this film. Very soft and sentimental in their respective roles, the pair create a sadness but an excitement within their difficult environment, and the ending, though I didn't cry, is praised for its sentimental value, which is very understandable.Too many current films are romantic comedies which run on clichés, but the Notebook focuses strongly upon the dramatic side of relationships, and is made as memorable as Titanic, with heart wrenching moments.The plot is extremely slow moving, to capture the mood of the character's personalities, so if you're up for fast paced action as well as romance, put Titanic on. But if you are in the mood for a very dramatic realistic approach to relationships with a few clichés thrown in, then this is for you.",The Notebook

67,gregsrants,"Touching and poignant, this movie has a heart",8,14 June 2004,"The Notebook is a chick flick.  I just wanted to get that out of the way rather early in the review.  So anyone who is thinking of seeing The Chronicles of Riddick and then sneaking in to see the Cassavetes new tear jerker, you should be told before hand that you are not the target audience for both films.  The Notebook is a surprising, emotional powerhouse of a film that had the theatre in tears in the simple telling of how two people met, fell in love and lasted until the end.  Set in the 1940's, the story is about two young opposites as read from a notebook to an elderly woman who's memory is victim to Alzheimers.  The film chronicles Allie Nelson (Rachel McAdams), a high-class, well-off teenage female who meets and soon falls in love for the wooing of Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling), a blue collar worker that makes forty cents an hour dragging and pulling bark off logs.  The two young-ins couldn't be more opposite and couldn't be more in love.  But love, as we learn can take time to reveal its destiny and the two are forced to deal with such obstacles and protective parents, war and eventually their biggest enemy, time.  Sob.I was not surprised to find that writer Nicholas Sparks has penned two other hanky flagging films in the past few years.  A Walk To Remember and Message in a Bottle were both fluff, but fluff that can induce one to take a few extra swallows to get rid of the lump in your throat.  The Notebook stays true to this course.  The endings (I say it plural cause there was a fade away that could have been an ending only for one more tear jerking act to play out upon fade up), were heart tugging and had I had access to hammer, wood and nails, I would have started to build an Ark and get to of every animal on board quick for there was not a dry eye in the screening.
Like any movie that tries to evoke an emotional response from its audience, we have to buy into the characters and their situations and it is here that The Notebook rises above Spark's other writing efforts.  Gosling and McAdams have true chemistry together and sparks fly from the time the two lie on the road to watch the street lights change color right to the ending that I can not bring myself to reveal in this review.  Their affection for each other is so real that a simple glance by Noah or a dimpled smile by Allie can relay to the audience more than any written word could express.  
Brilliantly shot by Director Nick Cassavetes with the help of memorable visuals by cinematographer Robert Fraisse, the film takes us to a time of enchantment where hundreds of ducks can accompany a romantic boat ride or where a reading on the dock at sunset can fill one with nostalgia. 
This was Cassavetes next film after the misguided John Q with Denzel Washington in 2001, and like Q, Cassavetes throws a lot against the wall in this film in hopes that most of it sticks.  We are given scenes of war in Europe, an engagement, the re-building of a house, the death of a father and the revealing of secrets by a parent.  All this kind of makes you feel as if you were standing in front of a Schwarzenegger machine gun getting hit with just about every possible scenario or experience that two people could ever encounter.  But thanks to the great acting and the shifting from the young teenage characters to their elder selves, it allows us breaks every once and while to catch our breathes and savor the love that these two had for each other.I couldn't help but think at the conclusion of the film that if this were a movie set in present day with a Jennifer Lopez type character in the lead female role, how awfully contrived and manipulating this movie would be viewed and I suppose this is the same realization the studio had to release the film amongst the summer blockbusters.   For all its small shortcomings, The Notebook is a refreshing bit of air in a summer of Ogres and talking cats.  James Garner gives a touching performance as the elder man who reads the notebook to Gena Rowlands (Cassavetes mother in the factual world), and when his heart is broken at a relapse of her memory, we cry alongside his anguish.  So I have to give a strong recommendation to The Notebook with just one word of advice.  That is to take lots of tissue or at the very least, buy a big bag of popcorn to hide your face from your date so she doesn't see you have a soft side.www.gregsrants.com",The Notebook
68,Danusha_Goska,Didn't Love It or Hate It; Just Wish It Had Lived Up to Its Potential,7,13 September 2006,"""The Notebook"" is one of those love it or hate it movies.""The Notebook""'s champions insist it is one of the greatest love stories of all time. ""The Notebook""'s detractors savage it as a manipulative, mawkish soap opera.I didn't love it or hate it. I saw a lot of good in it, but it didn't really move me, and given how much it had going for it, I wish it had lived up to its potential. In fact I find it kind of sad that so many loved this mediocre movie so much. That just shows what a huge appetite there is for non-violent, family friendly movies that celebrate old fashioned values like committed love.The best thing about the movie, for me, was Gena Rowlands' performance as an Alzheimer's sufferer. Gena Rowlands is one of those truly magical performers who bottle lightening, and firelight, in their performances. She is exciting and seductive.I worked with Alzheimer's sufferers for years, and Rowlands' exacting and yet poignant performance took my breath away. I would have to guess that Rowlands' studied Alzheimer's sufferers and crafted her performance from meticulous and compassionate observations.It was also great to see a movie that spent so much time with a female character, and actress, over forty.James Garner's -- entirely unnecessary -- removal of his shirt was challenging to watch. I remember Garner from films like ""The Americanization of Emily"" where he was ripely sexy.That was a long time ago, though, and Garner looks his age, and the movie doesn't spare us what time has done to him. His lips are blistered; his teeth have black spots; his body is spongey and thick.But I came to be grateful for that. There's something to be said for a movie that doesn't shy from viewing an old man's body.Garner is all the more impressive in that body. He still possesses and exercises the cocky command of his youth. In his love scenes with Rowlands, he gives his all, and his all is awesome to observe.The sets, lighting, and costumes are all lush.Ryan Gosling, who tears up in fifty percent of his scenes, is very sweet and dear, and Rachel MacAdams comes across as spunky.For all that -- this movie never came together for me. It was just too much of a Hallmark card, of a Thomas Kinkade painting. Everyone, without exception, is nice; everything glows; nothing is too challenging and no one is too smart. In fact, it's all just a wee bit afraid of being too intelligent, too challenging.The movie hearkens back to another era: the 1940s, in which much of the plot is set. Too, the tear-jerking, five handkerchief plot, with its unlikely twists, hearkens back to older unlikely tear jerkers like ""Random Harvest."" The thing is, though, those older films were not afraid of intelligence, or of the darker side of life. Yes, they were movies that an entire family could sit down and watch together, but they, often through subtle suggestion, evoked life's complexities. Even Frank Capra did this; suicide was a repeated theme in his most upbeat movies, including ""It's a Wonderful Life."" And Capra was not afraid of some very dark characterizations.Ultimately, ""The Notebook"" fails its brilliant cast, and its audience, ravenously hungry, in this age of teen - boy - exploding - monster movies, for dialogue-, story-, and character-driven movies that celebrate women of all ages, and timeless virtues.In spite of its failures, though, one could do worse than pop some corn and settle in for a couple of hours with ""The Notebook.""",The Notebook
69,russem31,True romance.,8,17 September 2006,"""The Notebook"" (2004) is a wonderfully romantic film directed adeptly by Nick Cassavetes. While the script is somewhat predictable (I mean who can't figure out the elder couple played by James Garner and Gena Rowlands is really the younger couple as told when they were younger in the 1940s). But it is the acting from the aforementioned veteran actors and the younger couple themselves - Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams - which really make this picture work. It's a pleasure to watch these four interplay throughout the film - thereby making the predictability okay in my book. On top of that, the cinematography is exceptional and mesmerizing. All in all, a wonderful 8 out of 10.",The Notebook
70,jpschapira,Now is the time to say it: All you need is love,9,31 March 2005,"I was, when I saw it some weeks ago, and still am amazed with this movie. I'm talking about one of the best romantic movies I've ever seen. The romantic movies that combine that passionate loved with drama and a perfect chemistry between the leads.My God! Rachel McAdams looked gorgeous in this picture; that's one thing that had to be said. Her performance was also great, for the kind of character she was playing (I'm saying this because of the other characters she has played; superficial sometimes). She can actually act, and this role is going to give her the opportunity to grow, although it was not recognized. I'm not saying it was overlooked, but it was impossible. Ryan Gosling got the performance of his life as Noah. He has chosen interesting roles in the past, but didn't have the chance to shine. Every move he makes here is perfect; his performance is flawless (although, as McAdams, impossible to be recognized). His way of talking remind me of Sylvester Stallone, when he played Rocky in the first film of the anthology; a little bit rough and dumb, but the perfect sum for a person in love. Anyway, the movie depended on the chemistry between the two young actors, and they didn't disappoint at all.The pros, Garner and Rowlands, have the same chemistry Gosling and McAdams have, only that they are older. Garner has been recognized with the Screen Actors Guild, for his whole career, and with his performance as Duke, he closes a cycle of an entire career. Rowlands seems pleased to be working with his son; who must admire her for everything she has done. Her work is remarkable, as Nick's. I heard Cassavetes directed this film because he wanted to. He hasn't got a great career as a director, but he knows what he's doing. He knows how to create the environment, for the whole movie, and for each frame in it. I saw him watching the actors from close, in each scene. He wants to watch everything; direct but also make the actors feel comfortable and sure of what they are doing. It shows.""The Notebook"" is actually a novel. And if it wasn't because of Nicholas Sparks' hands and inspiration (when he wrote his first novel), this film wouldn't exist. How romantic a story can be when it starts with the paragraph that says more or less like this: ""I'm a common man. There are no monuments dedicated to me and soon my name will be forgotten; but in one way, I have succeeded as any other being in this world: I have loved another person with all my heart"". The answer you'll find it watching ""The notebook"". The movie has many beautiful and moving scenes; sometimes, you know what is going to happen although you don't want that to happen. But those are the scenes you will see, and enjoy as I did.I don't know if this has been said, but I had to put it. The rain is falling down, and Allie (McAdams), says angrily to Noah (Gosling): ""Why did you end it? Why was it over?"". ""It was not over"", he answers with tears in his eyes. ""And it still isn't over"".And it will never be.",The Notebook
71,Atreyu_II,"Great book, ""so-so"" film",7,28 December 2007,"As a fan of Nicholas Sparks's romantic novels and being ""The Notebook"" one of my favorites, I had to see this movie. Now here comes the time to share my feelings about it. In my opinion, this is a reasonable, emotional and romantic movie, but the book is slightly superior. Without getting into the differences between the book and the movie, at least I've got to tell that I personally find the book deeper, more sentimental, more intense, more beautiful, more emotional and certainly more romantic.The book is one of the deepest and most beautiful love stories of all time and touched me like few romances did. Apart ""The Notebook"", only ""Message in a Bottle"" had the same impact on me - another one of the best books by Nicholas Sparks.Back to the movie ""The Notebook"", it isn't bad but it's inevitable to compare it with the book. Anyone who saw the movie and is familiar with the book, knows that the book is more complete (the same happens with ""Message in a Bottle""). As a movie, ""The Notebook"" seems somehow like a forced adaptation in many parts.About the actors, both Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are good in the roles of Noah Calhoun and Allie Hamilton, but I'm not sure if they are the best choice for these roles. I don't know who would I cast for Noah, but for Allie I'm sure that Jennifer Love Hewitt or Sarah Michelle Gellar would make a perfect Allie (any of them).In my opinion, the best thing about this movie is probably its beautiful landscapes and backgrounds, especially that enormous lake/swamp where Noah and Allie are crossing by boat and the lake scene with ducks flying at the beginning (by the sunrise or sunset time).",The Notebook
72,AngelHonesty,What a story,8,30 October 2021,"A true heart wrenched. Most love stories skip over certain aspects that are brought on in the notebook, and I think it makes it so hard to watch because of how real this can be. Rachel McAdam's acting was amazing as she carried the film on her shoulders. She shined so brightly as she took on the role of Ally. The film fell short with Ryan Gosling. Yes he was beautiful and he knew how to have a fun time, but he was so serious and intense half the time with those droopy sad eyes, that just made you forget he was there.The filming of the notebook and the cinematography was amazing. The director did such a good job at drawing in the viewer and making you fall in love with the love story. But unfortunately, the writer wanted something deeper than just the average love story, the movie is bittersweet and will have most in tears if not you'll defiantly leave feeling a little depressed after viewing this film.",The Notebook
73,barryrd,Lifelong love a powerful symbol of good,6,22 October 2010,"Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are great in this romantic film about a love that lasts a lifetime, crossing a huge divide between two families. From the very start, Ryan Gosling, who plays the role of Noah, falls head over heels for the girl who becomes the love of his life, Allie, played by Rachel McAdams. The two go their separate ways when their summer love affair comes to an end, with the intervention of her parents, who are unable to accept the fact that their daughter has fallen for someone who only earns 40 cents an hour in a lumber job, at the dawn of World War II. The broken-down house that Noah dreams of building into a home becomes a driving force and with some help from his father, Sam Shepherd, and a lot of work, the dream becomes a reality. The ever-competent Joan Allen, Allie's mother, hides the letters that Noah writes while he is overseas during the war, effectively snuffing out the romance, but only for a while. They reconnect seven years later and find themselves drawn again to each other. Despite her engagement to a man she cares deeply for, Allie finds herself in a bind and is forced to decide between the two. Her mother confesses to a similar relationship that she was involved in and abandoned her first love for a secure future but she does return the hidden letters. In a parallel story, an older couple played by two veteran actors - James Garner and Gena Rowlands, whose talents shines in this film, show the tenacity of their love as they reach old age. As an aside, the director of the movie is Nick Cassevetes, son of Gena Rowlands and John Cassevetes. He has made a very beautiful and sentimental movie that shows the power of true love. As with many love affairs, adversity makes the bond of love even stronger. A great love story is always a powerful symbol of good in our universe.",The Notebook
74,esteban1747,To be remembered for ever,9,14 March 2012,"It is a plot full of freshness, very alive, real, passionate and sentimental. An unforgettable film, with good performances of its cast and a brilliant narrative. All the time the spectator is anxious to see what will happen, the development of a relation almost lost, of a love flying between two opponents. The sincerity and the real love are the winners at the end of this novel. The film shows once again the false values of some rich, but also how those opulent people can succumb to the real love of the poor ones. Ryan Gosling was superb in the role of young Noah, his way of looking well expressed his desires and his human feelings. Rachel McAdams played also at the same level, she was young Allie, naive, beautiful and with plenty of energy for love. Experienced Joan Allen gave a nice performance as Allie's mother, while Gena Rowland and James Garner were as usual very effective and complemented very well the whole story of this film. Nick Cassavetes directed a film to be remembered for ever, a film which gives guidance of how to make good materials full of fragrance and dreams without the need to include violence in its scenes.",The Notebook
75,nicholas.rhodes,THE EPITOMY OF ROMANCE !!,10,19 September 2004,"I discovered quite by chance that this is currently running in my local cinema and was originally attracted to it by its plot ! I was not disappointed, it was an excellent all-rounder. I am assuming the director had prior knowledge of the films ""You're the Cream in my Coffee"", ""Blue Moon"" and ""Splendor in the Grass"" as this film would appear to include elements and themes from all of those.Picture quality and soundtrack are amazing. I was especially touched by the beautiful photography, the attention paid to lighting effects, the use of slow-motion bird flight, the setting sun. Each scene seems to have been filmed with thoughtfulness and artistic beauty in mind.Although the film clocks in at over two hours, I could not find one boring or slow moment ! Incredible, as I usually prefer shorter films. Of course we can guess from the beginning the correlation between the older couple and the young one, like in ""BLue Moon"" but this film is far more emotional because the idea of illness 'Alzheimer""s"" is introduced. All the actors give a magnificent performance and, as amply stated elsewhere, a large box of Kleenex is necessary to accompany you to the film.It is no use narrating the story, but suffice it to say that this is a HIGHLY ROMANTIC film, on a par with the great classics but not quite as sad as some. Although the sexual scenes are not explicit, they are nevertheless erotic without going over the top ! So beautifully is the whole thing filmed that its purchase on DVD is a must ! This is a film for those who are obsessed by passionate deep love and romance. Some viewers may well be able to relate to what happens between Noah and Allie ! It is not a film for lovers of violent or action-packed thrillers ! The violence is present, but in the strength of the love and chemistry between the principal actors. If you are a true romantic at heart you should NOT MISS this film !!!",The Notebook
76,bopdog,"Mostly enjoyable, but also too formulaic and overly sentimental",6,13 July 2004,"Overall, nice little movie. But it is also a bit 'tricked out.' That is, it is a bit manipulative and overly sentimental. I LIKE romantic movies, generally, and even some intensely emotional ones. I even cluck-cluck when film critics attack anything with strong emotions, or too-real humanity, mentally scolding them for their shallow self-anointed mantel of the too-cool.Point is, I usually defend the 'sentiments' of humanity in movies! But here, I was (and to my great surprise) put off a bit by some of the formulaic vibe of the movie. It was kind of corny, and silly, and inauthentic. Again, though, it was nonetheless watchable. I gave it a 6 out of 10, and would have posted a 6.5 if I could have.James Garner is magnificent in everything. Gena Rowlands is good, and good here. The guy, Ryan Gosling, may be a great human being, but his screen persona is too creepy for me (recall his total creep-out role in 'Murder by Numbers'). The chick was good--- Somebody Mc-Something. Don't know her name or work yet, but assume she will continue with a good career, and then everyone will know her.",The Notebook
77,PersianPlaya408,"Notebook is good, not your average chick-flick",9,8 August 2005,"This love story about a couple who meet and reunite after world war 2 is well written, directed and acted. This is one of those "" chick flicks"", however its probably the best one I've seen in a while. I enjoyed this film because the story appealed to me, characters were very interesting, script was well written and director kept it interesting, and actors did a good job of playing their roles. I am starting to actually like Gosling after seeing him in United States of Leland and now this. This film was entertaining and a great one for the couples to watch. Rachel McAdams is up and coming and i look forward to her doing good work like this film 9/10",The Notebook
78,moviesleuth2,"Hate to admit it, but I love this movie",8,23 July 2010,"Let me be upfront and say that I am a guy. This is not my kind of movie. I don't do sudsy melodramas, which this most definitely is. I don't like chick flicks either, which this also is. I don't care if this is a well made movie. Doesn't matter. End of story.Okay, fine. I liked this movie. A lot. It may be one of the most manipulative good movies out there, but if it works, who cares? This is plain and simply a wonderful movie.Based on the Nicholas Sparks' novel of the same name, ""The Notebook"" tells two stories. One is of a summer fling between mill worker Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) and rich girl Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams). The other is of an elderly man named Duke (James Garner) who is reading this story to a present day Allie (Gena Rowlands, mother of director Nick Cassevetes). But how are these two stories connected.The answer is of course fairly obvious, and the movie wisely doesn't try to hide that fact. The film's real focus is the romance between Noah and Allie, and everything that comes between them.The film works because of the strong performances and the equally strong direction. To say that Ryan Gosling is an unconventional leading man in this kind of a film is an understatement. Gosling burst onto the film scene in a riveting performance as a Jewish neo-nazi in ""The Believer,"" and went on to play two other creeps and killers before landing this role. Gosling stays true to form and does not approach the role in a conventional way. He's not a model and doesn't pretend to be, but his subtle free spirit energy works, and makes him quite literally impossible not to like. Rachel McAdams is equal to him. She's a rich girl that spurns off his random advances, but Noah doesn't stop, and when she finally humors him, she realizes that, gosh darn it, she actually likes the guy.Gosling and McAdams are supported by a strong cast of noted character actors. James Garner couldn't possibly be more endearing, willing to give up everything to be with Allie, who is slipping further and further into dementia. Likewise, Gena Rowlands is terrific as the elderly Allie, who is revisiting this story for the first time. Joan Allen is wonderfully wicked as Allie's conservative mother, who is trying to keep Allie from seeing Noah. It's a clichéd role, but Allen imbues it with so much life that the character becomes just as three-dimensional as everyone else. James Marsden is surprisingly good as Allie's new lover, rich boy Lon Hammond. Unlike many romantic complications, he's actually likable (in fact, one could make the argument that he's more likable than Noah at times). Marsden's range is quite limited, but this is his best performance. Sam Shepard is also on hand in a small role as Noah's father, but it's a good performance nonetheless.Nick Cassevetes has done the impossible: he's made a weeper that will appeal to those who don't prefer to watch movies with a tissue at hand. He does this by taking the melodrama as far as it can go without going overboard, and by establishing a nostalgic tone for the film. Watching the movie is like watching old home movies and revisiting fond memories of the past. The film is photographed by Robert Fraisse, who gives each beautiful shot its dreamy tone.Sometimes guys must be dragged by their girlfriends to see romance movies. Although they may put up a fight to see this one, they will probably like it as much as I did (whether they will admit it is open to question).",The Notebook
79,rossrobinson,Brings Tears To Your Eyes,10,29 June 2004,"I absolutely loved this movie, it brought tears to me and my girlfriend at the end of the movie. This movie is about Romance and other things, The movie is showing us who to pick to have a relationship with and making sure that it's the right one for you. I never sort of got interested in seeing the Notebook because i thought it was going to be a similar tale to Bridget Jone's Diary which i have never ever seen before. My girlfriend wanted to see the Notebook, so i had to go and see it, we sat down and watched the movie i thought it turned out to become a fantastic movie, i enjoyed every moment in the movie and i cried at the end when the couple died together in that care home. I give this movie out of 10. For you guys who sort of felt the same way about it being another similar bridget jones diary film, then take my advice, go out on a date with your bird, have a meal and then go to the cinemas, sit back and relax and enjoy watching The Notebook because it gets you in that Romantic mood.",The Notebook
80,thejcowboy22,A lifetime of Love! Personal connections throughout this movie.,6,18 January 2019,"For years I've lived with my second Wife and as time goes on I've truly learned the real hidden meaning of love . It's something you can't describe in words but the effects are there. As a youth my judgement was clouded with looks and lust. How much does love at first sight really work. I tried that once and was awestruck by this girl who worked in a store across the way. I wanted her in the worst way . There she was a vision of loveliness in tight jeans and those gorgeous eyes. I walked over to the store where she worked the counter. Each step closer was like an eternity as my legs felt like lead weights pushing forward. I reached the counter and there she was . I was so nervous and petrified. If she says yes what do i do? What if she says no? Anyway I boldly introduced myself and she was insensitive to my presence. I said some stupid things, ""Do you work here? Alot of weather we're having lately."" I was rambling out of nerves as she was getting perturb. I cut to the chase and said my peace. ""Will you go out with me? A mediate response of no came out and I was crushed . My response was ""Why?"" I wouldn't take no for an answer. I started to panic as things went from bad to worse as I said, ""I must have you and we are meant to be together."" She said, ""Get lost smuckie!"" Over a three year period I tried many attempts to sway her. Each attempt ended in predictable failure. The movie the Notebook struck a cord for me in many ways and conjured up old memories of lost loves and Ill health. First the comparison to the part of lost loves. We start at a retirement facility where we see an elderly bespectacled distinguished man named Duke (James Garner) who asks the aid if it's a good day to read to this elderly woman (Gena Rowlands) . A picturesque sunny day is the setting as Duke sits down and opens his notebook as he reads the story of two young people in the late 1930's. We don't know the relationship between the two retirees at first. As Duke reads; the film flashes back in time. Noah (Ryan Gosling) a tall,lanky fellow who works the lumber mill in a sleepy seaside town somewhere in the Carolina's sees the vision of his dreams on the street. This vision is the young and lively Allie Calhoun (Rachel McAdams). Noah pursues her as he climbs the Ferris wheel at a carnival and wants to date her. Allie finally caves in and the two bond quickly. All is not right in the social corners as Allie comes from a wealthy family and Noah is just a poor lumber worker. Joan Allen plays the snobbish mother of Allie and explains that Noah can't possibly give her the life she's accustomed to. Periodically the movie shifts back to the present day on the nursing home lawn where the Gray haired woman wants to know more. Duke reads on as Ally and Noah break up over a war of words. Allie goes off to school in New York as Noah deep down wants to rekindle the relationship as he sets out to write one love letter a day for 365 straight without a response from Ally. A distraught Noah has bigger issues as fate would have it. Noah and World War II sidetrack our story. War ends and Allie meets another man who is wealthy. Noah has a significant widow for company but he still has Allie on his mind. Noah purchases a dilapidated old mansion and fixes it up sparkling new. This house renovation brings the two lovers back together again. The scene on the lake with the ducks reminds me of the night I proposed marriage to my wife. Now the connection on ill health. We learn that the gray haired woman has the beginning s of Dementia, Alzheimer disease and has sporadic memory issues . Some heart wrenching scenes with Garner and Rowlands as her memory comes back but fades quickly. I remember the old days of a young dashing confident James Garner playing the gambler Bret Maverick on my old black and white TV. Nothing stopped in his way but today we see an older version of Garner popping pills and telling his friends ""I keep trying to die but they won't let me."" But in this film we see a caring, sensitive, vulnerable man in the autumn of his years reading the love story of yesteryear from his notebook to his Woman. I think back to my own personal experiences with my Mother-In-Law and her mental deterioration. From the initial phone calls from her office as to why she isn't doing her paper work to wetting herself or opening a car door while in motion. Then lashing out violently hitting my cousin and smacking my daughter for no apparent reason. Then finally lost, not knowing what to do next. The success and following of this film touched many viewers. From Love at first sight to the realities of mortality. But sustainable love between two people and a life time of affection for each other is the real hook in this romantic journey. After films end I'm wiping the tears from my face.",The Notebook

82,ruby_fff,"Reminiscence of romantic young loves - a thorough dramatic tear-jerker for the hopelessly, or hopefully, romantic",7,14 September 2004,"So it's quite melodramatic and probably familiar heart-tugging, sentimental plots - but you expect no less from a tear-jerker romance. The trailer of ""The Notebook"" sure beckons the romantics, young and old (since we see Gena Rowlands and James Garner included). It's worth it just watching the intense chemistry firing up, hot and cool, between the two central leads, Ryan Gosling as Noah and Rachel McAdams as Allie - it's a godsend pairing of these two young actors in their blossoming twenties, both from Ontario, Canada. Gosling is a stunner in his brave portrayal of Danny in ""The Believer"" 2001 (controversial subjects in a substantial film, indeed, from w-d Henry Bean). McAdams delivered a wickedly fun Regina George opposite Lindsay Lohan in director Mark S. Waters' ""Mean Girls"" 2004, screenplay by Tina Fey of SNL fame.There's subtle but steady supporting roles from Joan Allen playing the stern opposing mom (with a secret) to Allie, and Sam Shepard as the supportive enduring dad to Noah. The skilful cinematography by Robert Fraisse (responsible for director Jean-Jacques Annaud's ""The Lover"" aka L'Amant 1992) complemented director Nick Cassavetes and the production design efforts. Yes, that swan swarm scene is a true love sight incarnate, seven years or not. Chance and coincidences, in love and war, together or apart, are part and parcel to the plot. I enjoyed the chance of naturally washing my eyes through and through. It's a winning love story, soap or not.Two other movies also based on Nicholas Sparks' novels: ""A Walk to Remember"" 2002 directed by Adam Shankman, another tear-jerker about romantic young loves with an endearing performance from Mandy Moore as Jamie, Peter Coyote as dad Reverend Sullivan, and Shane West as Landon, who pursued Jamie and became a changed young man for the better. ""Message In A Bottle"" 1999 directed by Luis Mandoki, with Kevin Costner and Robin Wright Penn, and Paul Newman as Costner's dad - another lovelorn (tear-jerker) romance, this time more for grown-ups. For a heart-warming and delightful romance with touches of Italian flavor, bread or pie, mother and daughter, an ideal son-in-law, I recommend w-d Melissa Martin's ""The Bread, My Sweet"" 2001, aka Wedding for Bella (DVD title). Scott Baio is Dominic the brainy businessman-brother-baker next door, Kristin Minter is Lucca the long 'lost & found' daughter, and Rosemary Prinz is Bella the life-loving wife & mother in a charming, moving little film.",The Notebook

I am glad that I did go, because the story was an excellent one and the acting above all was great by Alli and Noah, both as youngsters and as oldsters. James Garner (although older and chubbier) and Gena Rowlands were an excellent addition to this film. Gena Rowland's should be proud of her son for great direction.

84,PeachHamBeach,"Wow, I was surprised!!!",10,14 April 2006,"Back when THE NOTEBOOK was just a book written by author Nicholas Sparks (I almost always get him confused with Nicholas Evans)I heard critics saying things. They weren't really mean. They weren't even snarky. They were kind of playfully saying that Sparks and his work were ""unabashedly sentimental"". I tuned into the movie starring Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, James Garner and Gena Rowlands last night, expecting a mediocre, and very sentimental romantic drama full of hearts and flowers and moosh.Boy I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this film!!! It was very romantic, full of sentiment and sweetness, but it wasn't full of fake mooshy slobbery sentiment. It felt real. Even the end, which I won't reveal, in all its heavy emotion and absolution, felt real, not overly sentimental. I'm certain some felt it was trying to paint a picture of flawless, perfect love, but in fact, their love and relationship was flawed and in need of nurturing just like anyone elses'.The performances of Gosling and McAdams as the young 1940s couple were terrific, but the heart and soul of the film are Garner and Rowlands as a present day pair of friends in a nursing home for people with Altzheimers. All the heartbreak of this affliction and how it destroys memories was compelling. The real meaning of love and commitment in married life and how you stay with your mate through good times and horrible times was beautifully realized here, as one party reads to another from a sacred story notebook in hopes of resurrecting precious memories, even if the disease snatches them back over and over.I plan to read the book soon.

But I kept watching (there wasn't much else on) and I think the acting really elevated this to something meaningful. Gena Rowlands, as Allie, the elderly, southern belle with dementia, is a real standout in her role: one minute sharp and wise, the next minute not recognising her own children. It's a really meaty role and Rowlands really runs with it. Rachel McAdams, also, throws everything into her role as the younger Allie, who must choose between two lovers -- whether to follow her heart or her head. It's a role that, under a lesser actor, could have been really pedestrian. But McAdams reacts and acts, rather than just reciting the lines and looking pretty. The scenes are sharply edited and the music isn't too overwhelming. The scenery is gorgeous and the costumes beautiful. Apart from the raunchy love scene, it's quite an old fashioned movie. Overall, it's good entertainment, and I even found myself bringing out the tissues at the end.",The Notebook

Must....not....cry....*snif*....*snif*,8,3 October 2007,"Everyone has been in love at least once in their lives, so why on earth is it difficult to craft a respectable love story? Over the years, it becomes harder and harder to find a good film about love and all its consequences. Even Titanic, the ultimate chick flick, is a disaster for multiple reasons. The romantic drama is a genre with a bad reputation because the genre always gets riddled with movies full of clichés, predictability, bad acting, bad dialogue, and the inability to tug at your emotions. For every Beauty and the Beast, you have three terrible romantic movies. For every Ghost, Sleepless in Seattle, Princess Bride, you have dozens of monstrosities. Enter The Notebook. The Notebook is a successful adaptation of a best-selling book by Nicholas Sparks, who is also responsible for A Walk to Remember and Message in a Bottle (the man apparently knows how to appeal to the females). Becoming strongly notorious for bringing out the lovey-dovey in every couple and even more notorious for emotionally destroying females everywhere, The Notebook easily stands as one of the greatest romantic films within the past decade. Becoming everything Titanic wishes it was, this movie is coupled with excellent acting, good dialogue, nicely woven plots, good direction, and good cinematography. Equipped with a good score, nice jazz songs, and a satisfactory ending, this movie will reach out for your heart and will force you to hold a box of tissues throughout the two hours. The surprise success comes with very good reason, for it is a movie that all of those losing faith in love should watch. We all know how difficult love is, especially nowadays in this seemingly cruel and twisted world. It is actually two stories in one. The first is an elderly man named Duke reading a book to this seemingly depressed elderly woman by the name of Allie who looks like she just wants to spend the rest of her life away from everyone else. The story Duke is reading is about a couple (Noah and Allie) whom have to separate after a perfect summer because of differing futures, the parents of the girl, and their social class differences. Both of them move on, but neither of the two ever wants to move past their love for each other; even when they are seen with other people living different lives. The ultimate test occurs when one of the two is actually about to marry. The Notebook switches between the story and what is going on with Duke and Allie. What keeps this movie fresh and different from the others is that it's actually two stories in one, and both are equally heartbreaking and touching. While it could have benefited from releasing more details about certain elements in the movie, the screenplay was excellent and moved at a respectable pace; all thanks to Jan Sardi and Jeremy Laden. Directing and acting are the two strongest portions of the movie. Nick Cassavetes (Alpha Dog, John Q) does a wonderful job progressing the story without being too slow, or too fast. He focuses less on the physical aspects of the relationships and more on the dialogue, more on the emotional aspects, which is a rarity and ends up portraying a much more realistic couple. Complimenting the directing is the cinematography, which shows some beautiful scenery, most notably a scene at a lake full of elegant birds. Rachel MacAdams and Ryan Gosling seem pretty much meant for each other. Their passion towards each other, and their anger towards the cruelty of the environment around them is nearly flawless; every line is delivered well and never crosses into cheesy. The supporting cast is also delightful, most particularly James Garner as the very friendly and patient Duke. Many themes of love are explored here: which includes never forgetting your first love, how love can and will prevail through all obstacles, and how love brings out the best and the worst in you. From the mental and physical breakdown of Noah in the later years to the bitterness that follows the mysterious Allie, love can build you up and tear you apart in a matter of seconds. A major rarity shown in The Notebook is that love is imperfect, and that is shown through the constant arguing between the main characters in the story. Finally, The Notebook isn't as predictable as other romantic flicks, even though they did drop far too many clues and the ending is revealed before it can come and shock you. Nonetheless, the movie ends in a very bittersweet note, so save plenty of tissue paper for the final scene. Bottom Line: Instant classic romantic movie, because they are so hard to find. When you find a movie that can make you smile, cry, waste tissue paper, and hold your loved one for moments longer afterwards, you've found a good movie. The Notebook has very few flaws, it is indeed a very good movie. The love amongst the main characters is far from cheesy and clichéd. This along with Eternal Sunshine (excellent 2004 romantic drama, totally recommend) stands as the perfect 1-2 romantic drama punch of the decade; they are the best love stories in recent years. A package of good acting, good writing, good directing, and good musical score makes this a must-own if you love these kinds of movies. Breathing some life into the dying genre, The Notebook succeeds as a total tear-jerker; whether you are a male or a female, whether you are single or taken, and whether you have a heart or not.",The Notebook
91,theshadow908,One of the better chick flicks.,6,25 June 2006,"The Notebook tells the same old girly movie story. A poor boy falls in love with a rich girl, who doesn't really like him at first, but they develop a relationship and become inseparable. When she has to go off to school and he goes off to war, they lose touch, and she ends up engaged to another man. After reading about her first love in the newspaper, she goes to see him, wondering how he's doing. They discover that there's still something there, and they fall in love all over again. This is just another chick flick, but it is one of the better ones.The problem I have with chick flicks is that they're always so depressing. One of the main characters is always dying, or ill in some way. Something always ends up going wrong in the end, and it's done purposely to make teenage girls cry. This movie is different. There's no terminally ill characters, and the main characters end up happy. However, this movie does have the same old formula of rich girl/poor boy. That's a story I'm starting to get really tired of.The acting is pretty good. I had no complaints about how cheesy the acting was, which is also new for me. As a guy, I only watched this movie because Rachel McAdams is hot, but she did do a really good job.Overall, it's still got its corny moments, but it's the best chick flick there is.6.5/10",The Notebook

However, it is easy to pick up early on that the old man telling the story is the husband of the woman is having memory lapses repeatably.The story is rather corny to some extent. Its a love than can't be contained by social standards and norms. That is apparent during the love story with the servants of African descent. But having any servants shows prestige. The man is from a construction family. They aren't the elites, but many construction workers make rather good money with enough experience.Anyway, the ending is fitting for the couple, but it isn't all to surprising considering the condition the film shows both of them to be in. And lets not forget, both of them broke hearts and family relations to be together. They certainly caused pain for their love. But, overall its average. I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't thrilled.

The story is beautiful and I guess this is the kind of love we all wish to happen in our lives, but aside from that wish ( which may affect our rating) I don't see this film as anything more moving or extraordinary than hundreds of others...I admit that the era of 30's and 40's is really done good. James Marchal was good in his role as well as Ryan and the main girl, but, although everything is pretty much OK, the film did not move me in any particular way - and some films do move me or make me cry.Six from me.

The thing that makes The Notebook so much better than the average romance film is there was so much care put into the production.  The cinematography is the best since Seabiscuit!  The music is good and used judiciously.  The editing is non-intrusive, which is a rare thing these days.  The acting is fine all around, especially by Rachael McAdams.  It's too bad Hollywood does not put this much attention to detail in more of their movies.

98,yris2002,The power of love: a good and well built romantic movie,7,3 September 2009,"After a disappointing ""love"" experience this movie came unexpectedly as a positive injection of sound love and hope to me. I really liked it and felt deeply moved by it, I almost needed it. The story in itself is nothing new, nor original (though I wonder whether there is still something new to be said in the field of love). What stands out is the way, in terms of simplicity and naturalness, which which the romantic story gets to the viewer. No melodrama, no pathetic script, sentimentalist excess is carefully avoided: this is just a simple, moving love-story, plainly narrated through the pages of a diary. It is so easy for the viewer to get involved, both with the juvenile passion, and then with the mature affection, between Noah and Allie, whose story simply testifies that attraction cannot be the only engine of love, and that without mutual, constant and loyal dedication and respect even the most powerful chemistry is doomed to fall miserably. The young actors playing the boy and girl are magnetically well paired, we can feel, sense the passion exploding from their bodies and souls, in the same way as James Garner and Gena Rowlands can communicate high sentiment in a superb way. Also Sam Shepard, as Noah's father, hits the sign, and proves how talented actors, used to more demanding roles, can offer highly professional performances also in lower-level movies and contribute to make a difference. So congratulations to movies like Notebook, which, although not being masterpieces, obviously (but they do not aim at being so considered) have that magic capability to let you go to bed with a soothing and delightful sense of trust, hope, or simply with the momentary illusion (but how much do we need it, sometimes!) that there are still sincere, honest and loyal men outside. And judging from the number of users' comments, both positive and negative, I infer that people are still attracted by romantic movies: in the end, all we need is love?!",The Notebook
99,chron,Unabashedly Romantic and Sentimental. It's Storytelling at its Best,10,26 February 2005,"This story plays out as Duke, played by James Garner, reads a story about two young people in the 1940s who fall in love and endure life. The movie moves between present-day and the 1940s. It is structurally very similar to ""Fried Green Tomatoes"", which is also one of my all time favorite movies.Unlike ""Fried Green Tomatoes"", this focuses on young love as it grows and endures through wars and parental dissent. Sure, the core is the ""Romeo and Juilet"" theme, but the way is plays out and the exceptional charisma that the actors bring to the screen make it feel fresh and not entirely predictable. This is a deeply romantic movie. If you are cynical at all about romance, timeless love and dedication to another person, you may find yourself rolling your eyes a bit. I am not that cynical about the emotional ties that bind us and I was thoroughly taken in by the story.This is such a gentle movie. The characters are very human and very likable. All of the actors turn in engrossing and compelling performances.Technically, this movie is exceptional, too. The scenes during the opening credits is absolutely breathtaking. The editing is very good. The story is compelling from the opening credits to the closing credits.My wife and I don't always share the same perspective on movies, but we agreed on this one. We both loved it immensely. I am certain this will become part of our permanent collection.",The Notebook
100,Greatornot,Pretty good but not earth shattering,7,14 March 2010,"I enjoyed this film but certainly it was not magnificent. The film was for the most part a basic love story. Wonderful acting performances, wonderful vintage feel to the film with costume,settings and general atmosphere. The setting for a good film was ripe. I felt the film did become too predictable and overly sugary. This was cliché to say the least. The movie got me gripped from the get go, which I suppose is a good thing. The film just seemed too flat at certain junctures.Yes , there were some tearful moments, but there were also moments of yawning. I do believe Noah and Allie truly did have that once in a lifetime connection that culminated in a fine story. I also believe that the writers were too safe with this script. Tastefulness is always fine, but sometimes a film can be too tasteful , and this was the case with this film. Other than some cute wooing antics, that boys will be boys will succumb , there was not much in the way of risk. This film was too vanilla. In summation, It was a good film, but never reached that higher plateau, which is quite sad. Worth a watch anyway.",The Notebook
101,davidtraversa-1,What - a - piece - of - garbage.,3,13 June 2011,"My gym teacher lent me this movie this morning saying: ""I saw it twenty times and I cry my eyes out every time I see it..."", ""I saw it the last time with a girl friend of mine and we both were crying buckets... we had so much fun!!"" -- Well..., not very good for a start. I'll see her the day after tomorrow so I wanted to see this movie and get the experience over as soon as possible. I couldn't. Its sooo booooringggg!!! The eternal first love (contradicted by parents opposed to rich girl marrying poor boy). The funny thing is this: Her family, from the South, plenty of money and manners (and prejudices) was supposed to raise this girl with a silver spoon in her mouth. Well, I don't know what Hollywood intends nowadays by a refined, well mannered girl from such a social group, but let me tell you that this girl looks and acts like a Pizza Parlor waitress (and please, Pizza Parlor waitresses forgive me for the comparison, since I'm sure many of you have the looks and manners of Lady Di).Oh, Grace Kelly, where are you?!! The guy instead, being a low brow worker, has the class that his love object lacks to the nth degree. Her husband in the story should have played the main character, having the physique du rol appropriated or at least more appropriated than (sorry, don't remember their names) the main character. If I'm not wrong the movie starts in the 50s or thereabouts ¿since when at that time women walked down the street in their shortest miniskirt?? Come on..., a bit of research, you don't need to do too much work to check these facts... After 30 minutes or so the watching became unbearable for me and, feeling bad about next Wednesday having to face my teacher with such a heavy disappointment when returning her CD: (""Did you like it?""...). I just couldn't go on with this movie and started skipping scene after scene to the bitter end (well, actually quite a relief for me) when the credits appeared. What - a - piece - of - garbage. Do you want to be swept off your feet with this kind of story? Three jewels: ""Splendor in the Grass"" (1961), ""Les parapluies de Cherbourg"" (1964), ""I girasoli"" (1970).

102,badajoz-1,Nice film,8,5 May 2009,"A film that if you look too closely at you can find probably lots of things not to like, but James Garner and Gena Rowlands along with Rachel McAdam keep it going along very smoothly. Underplayed by the director and writer, the schmaltz is kept under control, even though you can guess the end and the plot from early on. It is meant to be a love story with lots of ups and downs, and the ride is worthwhile. The story is told by an old couple looking back (in flashbacks) to an old love affair. Plenty of clichés, but the parents trying to keep the young lovers - one rich one poor - apart are not over the top, plot twists are just about believable, and the acting envelopes you, except for the really cynical and those who want their bagel and cheese (eg let's have the whole family feel good, and not neglected!). What really saves this film and promotes it above the dross and cliché of others is the firm portrayal of Alzheimers' - Gena Rowlands only remembers herself in short passages, and when she regresses you see the impact on those around, especially her lover.

Science fiction needs intelligent storytelling, war films require moving/agonizing drama. And of course, love stories need good chemistry between whoever's supposed to be in love. I thought this one had it in spades, with all concerned. It did get slightly melodramatic at the end, but nothing that anyone who enjoyed ""Somewhere in Time"" (another movie that many love story fans are fond of) couldn't handle... in fact, the former was quite a bit more sappy or melodramatic, and in my opinion this one leans toward realism more than the average. I just saw it ""cold"" on a cable channel without knowing anything about it, and was basically riveted to the screen the entire time.

Romance is not really my cup of tea, but I watched this with some friends once and did manage to cry a little. The story takes a while to get going, but once it's all set then it is worth following. The romance is tacked on for the majority of the picture, but the truth at the end of the film makes the moment sweet and touching.

It was a spellbinding romance well-acted by Gosling and McAdams, backed up by Rowlands and Garner, two veteran actors. It was engaging, sweet, and even tear-jerking at times. It had a lot of heart, more heart than most romantic films in the 21st century do. Than the story went sour, the ending was contrived and almost felt laughable. The ending spoiled the film for me. Yet Cassavetes stages it well and the performances are vibrant from all four of the leads especially Rowlands in a very personal performance.

This movie is considered one of the best of the year, but i can't agree. Despite the fact that the script is very good, the development of the story, the idea of the power of love...The election of the main young pair splits it all, I cannot find any kind of chemistry between them, they never seem (specially she) comfortable in their parts, which make the young's story (the most important) very annoying and hard to watch. On the other hand, the old's story is much better, good acting and directing, and, as it goes after, and the fact that it is VERY well ended, it leaves you a good feeling, but I have found most of the two hours before quite boring; which has caused me to put it not as good mark as other people has done.",The Notebook

The Notebook was on my watchlist for quite some time and due to its poster was misled into believing that this was a rainy themed romance. But alas, this movie turned out to be a nightmare. There's just one scene in the rain which is the best part about this film. There's literally nothing else in this film, no other scene that's worth watching at all.This film is so overtly clichéd and contrived and the screenplay so jarring, that you may struggle to complete it. Yes it's a very tedious film to get through. While Rachel McAdams looks pretty and her acting seems good here and there, it's the script's fault that her character may seem annoying at times. However, Ryan Gosling was just disappointing. He's a decent actor who gave a really good performance in La La Land, but in this film his acting fails to impress.The movie turned to be a massive let down. With such high ratings for it, I at least expected it to be decent at best, but was left feeling very disappointed. How can anyone love such a 21st century film with such clichéd story where everything feels so contrived is something that I fail to understand. The film fails to evoke any real emotions in anyone who watches it, which is why this movie is for me, The worst Romance movie ever.2/10 from me. 1 extra just for the scene in the rain lol.This movie has nothing else to offer.

112,lyubitelfilmov,About life and dreams or Two hours of emotional and touching love,9,3 October 2020,"Melodrama. Screen adaptation of the novel ""Notebook"" by American writer Nicholas Sparks. Russian localizers decided to translate the title (as well as the book by the way) ""Diary of Memory"", for which I am even grateful to them, because this name more accurately conveys the essence of this wonderful and touching picture. I will say right away that I have not read the book, but I am going to fix it as soon as life circumstances allow. And I watched the picture itself on the recommendation of a friend - which I did not regret a bit. However, I was sure at the level of intuition that I would like this picture. Intuition did not disappoint me again, and here is my brief opinion - two hours of emotional and touching love. I did not notice any flaws in the picture, although an experienced eye was looking for them, but this time I failed, so I intend to draw your attention to the expressive merits of this soulful and touching melodrama.
So, here they are:
1. Love story - the picture tells the story of an elderly gentleman, who, being in a nursing home, takes care of an elderly lady in every possible way, reading that story of incredible love that has passed a series of tests. Here you can find the difference in the social strata of lovers, the parental question, a long separation, a happy reunion. Every persistence of the elderly boyfriend flatters the lady, and she begins to remember something. I simply have no right to tell you the whole story, because it will be the purest disrespect for those viewers who have not yet watched this picture. Well, those who watched - they all know very well themselves, and they are revising this wonderful picture, because it deserves it. The film raises questions of love, perseverance, devotion to ideals, dreams, care and many more, to which each viewer himself can give an answer. I already have the best love story, but this one deeply sunk into my soul, I can't argue with that.
2. Music - I will not say that it ""blows up the brain"", nevertheless, the music from the picture ""Me Before You"" is much better, but in terms of the atmosphere - it does an excellent job, that's for sure. It conveys the spirit of the era and the very mood of this wonderful picture.
3. Humor - it is practically not here, I counted only two funny moments - but they caused an enthusiastic reaction in me, which I will not be able to forget for a long time.
4. Thoughts - here and selfless devotion to a loving person, and the meaning of life. Here I have collected all the thoughts that visited me when viewing. We will all die, it is impossible to argue with that. But how will we live through the time allotted to us? Each person must decide for himself. Selfless faith, in God, in man, in a dream. Romantics have changed this world, romantics have pushed the boundaries of human knowledge, romantics have conquered this world, and they continue to do so. Romantics changed the world, although they were far from using it. Selfless belief in a miracle, or God, makes people stubbornly pursue their goal, overcoming all obstacles. Perseverance, it can perform a real miracle. Loyalty - loyalty to people - is what deserves attention, even though our age is not as long as we would like. What will each of us leave behind after we die? Each of us has our own path, which we must go through to the end. The main character believed in all of this, and this moved him throughout his life. What drives us?
5. A touching ending - I knew about the ending, but it still knocked out emotions. The film ends on a truly high note, an emotional note that simply cannot be forgotten!
6. Emotions - I thought I could handle it, I thought that the story with ""Hachiko"", ""Moulin Rouge"", "" The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Last Christmas"" will not repeat itself. but I was wrong. Right up to the curtain, the picture was able to knock out my tears, equally sad and happy tears from the ending of this story. Consider me a ""snot lover"" and a ""little girl"", I don't care. Let's see how you react to the ending.
A little about the main characters:
1. Noah Calhoun performed by Ryan Gosling - a poor worker who fell in love with a girl of a different social status. A little eccentric, falling in love - he loses his head, committing the most insane acts. A real romantic who has not lost faith in his dream. Their feelings have to go through a series of tests. It turns out Ryan knows how to play romantic characters, he did not know this, for which I can only praise him. Well done!
2. Ellie Hamilton, played by Rachel McAdams, is from a wealthy southern family who fell in love with a poor guy. Their crazy and beautiful romance is mesmerizing. Not without sharp corners that only enhance their feelings. Rachel made me happy, still young, still naive, but already so sensual and romantic. Clever girl!
By the way, the erotic scenes were a success. They are shot beautifully and with passion, without slipping into vulgarity or outright vulgarity. All directors of melodramas and romantic comedies - take note and take an example!
Will I be reviewing it? An interesting question, which I cannot give an exact answer, because I said that I would not revise two melodramas, but I eventually revised both. Let's wait and see, ladies and gentlemen!
The picture is not a masterpiece, but it definitely deserves a solid ""five""!
Well, at the end I would like to paraphrase the famous phrase of Zhenya Lukashin from The Irony of Fate:
""I have a feeling that during these two hours I have lived a whole life ...""
As a result, we have an excellent emotional and touching melodrama, with an excellent script, great atmosphere, suitable music, lots of thoughts to think about and great acting work.",The Notebook

114,ThomasColquith,A Middling Romantic Yarn,5,10 October 2021,"I finally watched ""The Notebook"" just now, 17 years after its release. I heard it was good, but more of a chick flick obviously. I call it just ok. The lead actors don't really convince me of their great love; their ranges seem limited. The script seems to be full of previously seen cliches such as ""make me a dove"" (Forrest Gump), fixing up the old house (It's a Wonderful Life), the disapproving family (Inventing the Abbotts), etc. Of course there is nothing really new under the sun and there are only some many types of stories to tell, but the great films and works of art find some manner in which to excel and break new ground, whether that is through exemplary acting, music, language, frame composition and hue, sets and costumes, etc. Unfortunately, ""The Notebook"" excels at none of those things and is just a middling romantic yarn, offering nothing very new or memorable. That's not to say it's bad or not worth watching, especially if you enjoy this genre, but for most this film will probably fall flat with you, at least until the end; the characters do not really resonate or engage the audience. In summary, ""The Notebook"" is often a struggle for male viewers as it is full of female fantasies, predilections, and tropisms, the details of which I will not get into here. Suffice to say, 5/10.",The Notebook

It is definitely a chick flick, but I found it to be well acted and a compelling story.  I thought the actor who played Lon, however, looked more like James Garner than Ryan Gosling did...and I guess it was a little unbelievable that the girl would pick him, looking as bedraggled as he did, over the good look rich guy...but maybe that's just me :)  When the older James Garner was looking at the photo albums, I almost laughed because it was quite a transformation...Gosling looks nothing like Garner.

It could easily considered as one of the best romantic films ever made, and personally I found it to be very inspiring from beginning to end.While most modern movies usually don't inspire me to read the book in which many of them are based, ""The Notebook"" was good enough to awaken my interest for the source material, and I have to say that Nick Cassevetes did a great job capturing perfectly well the mood and essence of the original novel.I found ""The Notebook"" to be an excellent film and I honestly wish there were more movies like this. Nowadays, almost every movie seems to be filled with an overload of CGI or some superhero/fantasy stuff (While I have to admit some fantasy and superhero films can be incredibly good, I 'm starting to become tired of the over-saturation of both genres)",The Notebook
117,Gunn,One of the Best Love Stories Ever!,10,19 May 2010,"This film is so brilliant in every aspect and ranks at the Top of any list of great love story movies. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are superb in the role of two star-crossed lovers who experience all the joys and heartbreaks of unconditional love as do James Garner and Gena Rowlands as lovers in their twilight years. The rest of the cast is also top notch including Joan Allen, as a controlling, but penitent mother and Sam Shepard as a down-to-earth, caring father. The story is simple but it rings so true that it moves one's heart and tear ducts. The cinematography is stunning, the direction well-paced, the music score not to sugary, bland or predictable, but just right to add to the perfection of this film. All the chemistry is there on the screen and it just draws you in to the story almost immediately. Normally, I prefer unconventional love stories like ""Marty"" or ""The African Queen"", but this one strikes a perfect chord for me and I highly recommend it.",The Notebook
118,gk303007,Good execution if not perfect,7,11 May 2020,"Movies based on the theme of amnesia give wide range to execute and come up with a worth effort if executed precisely. Some other examples directly or indirectly related to it are Memento and A Moment to Remember both of which had actually impressed me beyond imagination.This movie is also on same concept where a partner starts forgetting things and at the end, the story had to be reiterated everyday by her better half so that she can keep him always in her memories. Also, two parallel story running was a great effort and it did work. However, saying so and with all the good observations, i still felt a lag to quiver my heart as the story started unravelling its crux. And that was something which i missed. At the end, i was just ok with a sad ending rather involved with the characters and feel like what they felt.",The Notebook
119,daniellawson-14-787057,So overrated; for hopeless romantics only,4,4 July 2020,"POSITIVES:1) The performances are good, especially James Garner who adds necessary class and gravitas to the film
2) The film is well put together, in the sense that the cinematography, costume design and production design are all pretty good
3) The second half is much better than the terrible first halfNEGATIVES:1) Ryan Gosling literally gets Rachel McAdams to go out with him by threatening to commit suicide (?!?!) and then stalking her around the town?!?!
2) The dialogue made me wanna be sick, it's like nails on a chalkboard: ""if you're a bird then I'm a bird"" ""it wasn't over.... it's still not over!"" URGH
3) The film is littered with gender issues and race relations issues
4) The plot is so cliche and frankly feels like a poor Titanic impression. For example, the working class man falls in love with the upper class woman (like in Titanic) and the story is told in flashback revolving around the woman now being old (like in Titanic).
5) The score is so over the top and is constantly hitting you over the head with the swelling strings. They may as well have had someone holding up a sign saying ""you should feel emotional now""",The Notebook

In fact it was one of the best movies I've seen all year. The acting was great, the music was beautiful, and the plot was wonderful. My favorite part of the movie was when Allie and Noah first met at the carnival. That part was funny and cute. I also liked the part when Allie went to visit Noah in his house after they haven't seen each other in years.

Jame Garner gives a remarkable performance as Duke the aging husband.  Ryan Gosling gives a convincing performance as the younger version of Noah Calhoun, a lumberjack who falls in love with a wealthy girl.  Sam Shepard too gives a stunning portrayal of Noah's father, Frank Calhoun,  in this cinematic treat.  It is filmed in photographic perfection with color and scenery that is totally in keeping with the story itself.  One becomes engrossed with the passionate relationship of Noah and Allie.  The essence of total dedication to one's spouse is the thematic conclusion.  I can recommend this picture to anyone with a dramatic sense of humanity.  Even the music is adapted well to the screen.  The casting is remarkable.  It is a must see movie.  Don't let it slip by.",The Notebook
123,iguth,Ryan Gosling's second best,10,27 April 2019,"The Notebook to me is the second best romance film of all time beaten out only by Ryan Gosling's 2016 masterpiece La La Land. The Notebook is sweet, romantic, and is a story within a story. The external plot of Duke in the nursing home is sweet and it allows you to sympathize with older couples as well as people who suffer from dementia. The beginning of the story is nice and Ryan does a beautiful job bringing emotion to Noah. Rachel McAdams also pulls off a convincing Allie that goes through a lot of character development. Noah spends the whole movie infatuated with Allie and it works. Allie however has the more interesting arc as her character starts as a prim rich girl who moves into a radical, fun loving, passionate, risky girl for the time period. She then is forced to go back to her roots only to end up back in his arms. The whole movie is filled to the brink with iconic and beautiful scenes that are constructed specifically to make your heart melt. Its ups are high and its lows are way down low but I think that that just adds to the experience.",The Notebook
124,noizyme,Very sweet tear-jerking movie about love's past & future,8,15 February 2005,"This movie starts out innocent enough, and the entire thing couldn't have been any sweeter than it was. The story was magnificent and timeless, straight to the point and unforgettable.The story takes place in present day and has a constant look back on the story of one couple's desire to be together through loss and senility. Even though they are apart throughout large groups of their lives, they still seem to find each other in the most perfect display of a humanistic romance. The notebook that is written tells the entire story to both of them as Allie, the girlfriend, struggles to piece together everything. To continue explaining the story would almost ruin it because of the way the film is laid out, but you need to understand every step.This movie reminded me of such films as Forrest Gump, About Schmidt, & Playing By Heart. There are so many of these great stories out there on DVD that to come across another one almost makes you wish there were more hours in a day. Everything was perfect in this film, from the direction to the music pieces that were played to the scenery in every period in which these two met and dated in.I gave it an 8/10 for its appeal to all ages and the universal message, which is almost a comfort to put aside all of the current world problems to enjoy a great story like this. Buy it today because you'll want to keep that DVD for a very long time.",The Notebook
125,QueenMakeda84,"Love, Love, Love This Movie",10,3 August 2005,"This movie was beyond beautiful. The entire plot was just magical, sweet, and tender. I own the movie and it has become one of my favorite films. I enjoy the great love the characters have for each other. I work in a nursing home, so seeing that kind of affection from old school folks really does exist. It's warm to see that kind of love outlast some of the turmoil and cruelty life throws your way. It's so hurtful to watch the person you love and adore not remember you little by little. They forget the life you've shared. Alternately, Allie's depression and turmoil that she's forgetting the one thing that's been a constant in her life. The older characters played their parts to a T. You sensed the deep love and loyalty he had to his wife's well-being.Ryan and Rachel were adorable together. I can't imagine anyone else in their parts, but I'm sure it could be doable with other actors. These two just had great chemistry like a real relationship. When I say that, I mean, you could see yourself in a relationship like their's. It reminded me a lot of my own relationship with a significant other. Two people come into each other's lives and profoundly affect the other so that nothing can really break that bond. Not years of separation or misunderstanding. That love really does exist, and this movie visualized it for us.I liked the singularity of Noah's character. He has one parent, one best friend, and one girlfriend. His world is very closed, and Ryan hit upon that well. As Allie, Rachel played her as a likable young girl. Not some spoiled rich chick with no understanding of life. Rachel understood Allie's confusion to play by the rules, but it was different in that she truly loved him. It wasn't some arbitrary set-up by elitist parents. Lon was very deserving of her love. James Marsden has really grown as an actor as well by being in this movie. I look forward to greater things (no more ""Disturbing Behavior"" films please :D). Beautiful cinematography. Beautiful acting. Beautiful music. It was a love story that was on par with ""Love Story"" and other greats. Truly recommend.",The Notebook

127,TheFilmGuy1,Cheesy But Saved By Its Lead Performances,7,16 August 2014,"The Notebook is a well known film. If you say ""romance film"", the first movie that pops into peoples minds is generally The Notebook. I would say they do because of two main reasons. The first reason being that it's written by Nicolas Sparks, the writer of tons of cheesy romance books, making it have some really cheesy elements to it, but I also believe that it's chemistry between its leads helps save this from falling flat. (Which is ironic because apparently Gosling hated McAdams when they were shooting and they didn't get along)As I said, the film is quite cheesy. It uses many clichés that romance movies use, the biggest probably being the ""rich girl loves poor boy whom her parents disapprove of"" cliché. There's also a lot of unrealistically cheesy stuff with the whole Alzheimer's's thing, making it just seem ridiculous. You can tell a lot of things are written to be overly romantic or tug on your heart strings without much regard as to what makes sense. That's not to say there aren't good romantic things here. Sometimes love and romance can be cheesy in real life, that's just the way it is, so you kind of have to accept things to a certain degree. Moments such as the kiss in the rain or love scene really work, but I think that's all because of the chemistry between Gosling and McAdams. This really is a film saved by its performances. Moments that would seem awkward or cheesy if done with other actors seem more believable between Gosling and McAdams, totally boosting the quality of this film. Gosling comes across as a really love struck guy who you feel for, and McAdams pulls off that beautiful and fun but slightly naive and unsure girl role perfectly. I honestly think this movie would be another stupid film to appeal to unrealistic female fantasies if it wasn't for these performances.Overall, I think this film is well known in the romance genre for a reason. It's got cheesy moments but stuff that works. I do believe, however, that it's way more easily enjoyed by people who are currently in love or in a relationship or whatever, because if you haven't experienced it, you just won't feel the feelings that Gosling and McAdams wonderfully express in their best moments. If you're single and lonely... you will hate this film big time.",The Notebook

Also i love Rachel McAdam's so.
I don't even know what to say about this movie because so much of it is feeling. It just makes you FEEL, and its rather hard to describe that.
My only criticism would be the casting of the old folks, i think they did a poor job on that. But the rest of this movie is so good that it supersedes that in a BIG way.",The Notebook
130,AZINDN,"First Love, Last Love, and Lasting Love",9,24 October 2005,"The Notebook is a story in a story format that opens with Duke (James Garner) and his friend, (Gena Rowland) who are residents in a nursing home. Duke reads to the woman who demonstrates advanced senile dementia and his story serves to recollect and intrigue from her fuzzy memory. The story he reads of Noah (Ryan Gosling) and Allie (Rachael McAdams) is set in the pre-WWII rural south where he is a blue collar mill worker earning 41 cents an hour, and she is the lively daughter of wealthy parents who want her to make a good match. Noah and his father (Sam Shepard) are wealthy in other ways with their love of poetry which is integral to their relationship, while Allie is defined by the pressures for young women of patrician upbringing of the era.Gosling and McAdams as the young lovers are vibrant, endearing, and explosive on screen as first love blossoms to overtake the plans of Allie's parents for her education at Sarah Lawrence College. While Noah's father supports his choice, Allie's parents are not delighted with their daughter. It is a familiar story of poor boy loves rich girl, pampered girl wants to please her family, and her family wants the best for their child and will go to whatever gets the daughter married to the rich nice guy (James Marsden). Noah and Allie fight, love, and are fated to be separated by the classism of her parents, the war, and her willingness to go along with the expectations of southern society, or so the audience is lead to believe. Noah rebuilds his dream house, rows on the lake, and pines.Young lovers are contrasted by the devotion of Duke to the woman, and their relationship is the downside of the story as bodies and memories failing, the senior couple have their own problems -- his health and her inability to remember. Visited by grown children and grandchildren, Duke is revealed as Noah, and the woman is Allie. Although loving and supportive of their parents, the children want their father to leave the nursing facility and return to them because they recognize the hopelessness of their mother's inability to recollect her husband, her children and grandchildren, and their long marriage. But, Noah is committed to his sweetheart and stays by her side hoping for a miracle that will bring her memory back. So, he reads to her their story each day and waits for brief moments of lucidity to manifest.The film is a wonderful example of exquisite cinematography, storytelling, superior casting, and picturesque location that unites in a rare film of charm and sentiment without deteriorating into maudlin emotionalism. With disposable marriages the norm for contemporary society, The Notebook presents the fading notion of loyalty, devotion, and commitment for a lifetime. It is a gentle film with old fashion values and as characterized by Gosling and McAdams, Noah and Allie experience the joys and heartbreak that long lived romantic love creates till death do part.",The Notebook

132,jaddison383,Give yourself in to the emotion and you'll do just fine...,6,19 March 2008,"Regarded by many as one of the greatest chick flicks ever made (many would say the best love story), 'The Notebook' has become very widely-viewed and popular. It has many flaws. The acting of the younger lovers is not too great, and the sappiness can be exhausting at times. On top of all that, the film goes on far too long.BUT... If you can allow yourself to look past all of that, what you will find is a genuinely touching love story. Indeed, you probably have a heart of stone if some scenes don't honestly move you. Trust me, I'm not one for dumb cheesy Hollywood romances, but the older pair of this film is lovely. Gena Rowlands deserved a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her smaller role.The best way to watch 'The Notebook' is by forgetting inhibitions and letting yourself become absorbed in the emotion of the story. Give in to the sappiness and 'The Notebook' works just fine. 6/10 stars! Jay Addison",The Notebook

Later, the story in this book said that there is always such a summer love, such as shooting star, leaving the most brilliant spark in the night sky. Summer is really a season suitable for love. However, the best love does not happen in summer. It wanders through the seasons and never stops. Only the short-lived joy that ended early will blame the season angrily.That summer was wonderful.

134,cwade22,Very painful reminder for me.,10,28 February 2021,"Im 34, as i type, never had a girlfriend. My first kiss took her own life. Not sure why. Every case of ""love"" was unrequited, or the girl lived far away or bad timing and she was with somebody else. I gave up on it. It's too painful to try. Im not where i want to be in life, right now. I dont know where to look. People from that generation had simple lives. Not many distractions like today. They're lucky. Many grandparents were like these 2. Doesnt matter what race or whatever, very similar to a lot of people. I think of my grandfather who was married to my grandmother for 65 years until she died unexpectedly in hip surgery. He'll be 95 in april.I watch this film, Pearl Harbor, I see men who are legendary and just better than me. I'll never be like them. I dont know what's missing. Will i ever have the ""love"" Allie and Noah had? I dont know. At 34, it doesnt even seem close. But people die virgins, they die as children from cancer, some die in war having never dated a girl. Still, I feel like i'm different when i watch movies like this. It's very painful to watch. I was crying so hard!I've only watched this film 3 times in my life, as i type. 2004, when it was in cinema, 12 years ago, randomly on tv, and Today. I even have the DVD! It's UNOPENED! Wrapping still on it. I can't watch this film. It was on, and i felt it harmless, so i set the channel. And BAM! Im crying so hard! I dont cry very much. Movies that make me cry: Forrest Gump, The Butterfly Effect, Benjamin Button, LIFE(1999 same director as this film) and THE NOTEBOOK! Those films always make me cry! I think Life, Forrest Gump and the Notebook make me cry the hardest!It's easy for me to fall in love with Rachel Mcadams. She was so beautiful and great acting. In 2004, The girl i loved was Lucy Hale. Lucy was in my church Youth Group. I didnt know who she was. Just that she was cute and very nice to me. I had a crush on her. She seemed to think i was a cool older boy type(only 2 years older than her) and seemed interested in me. But wow! My mom was still driving me and i was 17! How can i even think of dating Lucy Hale when my mom still drives me?! Lol. Every time that summer 2004, my mom would drop me off, lucy was at the entrance seeing it and probably thinking i wasnt so cool. But i also just spent 14 months at Fork Union Military Academy and was awkward with girls. Still, lucy was the girl i thought about when i watched this in 2004! Lol. I think She moved from memphis to Los Angeles shortly after that summer. So, i hadnt seen her until jan 2010, randomly at whole foods where she gave me a hug and asked how i was. I last saw her dec 2017, i looked in her eyes, talking to her at baggage claim, and her eyes seemed the same as 2004. She's a nice girl. But the sadness i feel when watching this film isn't about My heavy feelings for her in 2004. It's the concept of love and how it seems daunting/fleeting/hopeless. I dont love Lucy hale. That night after watching, i DID cry really hard in my bedroom thinking of Lucy. She was a nice girl, still is, great actor, too. But i dont know if i'll ever find love at all, let alone like the kind i saw in this film.I rated this film 10 stars because it's not just a love story, it's a great concept and WOW! It's something to maybe hope for. Look forward to. Even when the mom told her story, i cried a little in the pasta i made. Gross. Life is crazy. For me, it's best that i dont even think about love or watch movies like this. I can't do it. I'm not strong enough to fight for it like they did. Like noah did. Wow! He was so addicted to her that he kept fighting for those few minutes every year or month or whatever when ""ALLIE""
Would come back and remember him. What a sweet thing to look forward to and fight for! Wow! Maybe One day Chris Wade will also find love. Lol. Also! WOW! Rachel McAdams has a beautiful naked body.

135,Keemshave,Great first half.,7,16 February 2021,"The notebook is a film that had so much potential to be an all-time great. The first half was fun, heart-warming, and captivating. Seeing two characters fall in love, reflected through the great chemistry between Gosling and McAdams, was absorbing to watch.However, the second half of this film fell a bit flat for me. Allie decides to choose Noah over her fiancé, and the decision did not seem earned. It is entirely understandable that she would come to this decision because of her close connection to Noah, but the sequence of events in this part of the movie did not make it seem as believable as it could have been. There is perhaps only one scene that expresses a reason for Allie to go back to him. They both love having fun together in the first half of the film, and Noah is a happy-go-lucky type of guy, despite his financial situation. It is suggested that because of this fact, Allie's character chooses to love him, and seeing him in a different state of mind in the latter part of the film, even with Allie in his presence, leads me to believe that if this were a true situation, Allie would not have chosen Noah.The Notebook provides plenty of entertainment and a lovely first half, even with this glaring problem I have with the second half of the film.

137,bjones,Zing go the strings,9,25 July 2004,"Zing go the stringsFirst I'd like to thank Hollywood for finally telling a story that shows just how much I love my wife, Beverly, of 32 years. This goes as much to explaining the unexplainable as any I've ever seen. I'll skip the story description as many have described it, many without great accuracy. Save to say that it's a love story of young lovers from opposing classes, caught up in world events that help alter their lives. I'll stick to the meat of movie making here and what this has done.It is apparent that audiences definitely get drawn into the story wholesale. As I left the theater the lobby was full of weeping females, some of which could be heard in the darkness throughout the film. What I really liked here was this great performance by the utterly charming Rachel McAdams as Allie. I saw her not long ago in an almost vapid part in ""Mean Girls"" but here she shines. The girl clearly has talent and I hope now to see more of her. I really fell into her story and it was great fun to watch her on screen. She stole the screen in every scene she was in with her sheer radiance. Of the younger cast she was most watchable on screen followed closely by Kevin Connolly. Of the more experience cast both James Garner as the older Noah and Gena Rowlands as the ailing Allie were stunning in their very believable portrayal of an older couple. I treasure both performances. Maybe James will finally get an Oscar nod.The screenplay was a bit heavy if one reflected long but it's more pleasurable to buy a little suspension of disbelief and just enjoy it. The locations, scenery, costumes and sets were terrific, I loved it all - with the exception of the hoard of domestic geese foisted off as migratory (there's only so much I can swallow). That scene with them on the lake will be one that lives in my memory for a long time to come. The musical program was good too, not to heavy and just noticeable enough.What I just could not swallow was the presentation of the Noah Calhoun character by Ryan Gosling. His acting was good, maybe even great. But his presentation got in the way of my enjoying it. With all the trouble to make a period piece, how can Hollywood ignore a central character? He looked like someone straight out of 1985, not 1945. He was way to shaggy haired, especially for the staid post-war South, and a beard, a waxed chest... give me a break! James Marsden was far more authentic looking for the time period but even his hair had too long a trim on the sides. I guess it's a move to try and woo the female attendees of today but it just stank authenticity wise to me.I'll just stick to watching the captivating McAdams.",The Notebook

McAdams and Gosling at the outset of their career as leads have excellent chemistry as the young lovers, and Garner and Rowlands are a couple of solid old pros in the framing story.

In the book Noah and Allie meet each other as teenagers in the 30's until they take a break from each other for 14 years and then reunite when Allie is engaged to Lon Hammond Jr and Lon Hammond lets Allie be with Noah cause he understood the love between them. Now in this movie Noah and Allie's relationship is both romantic and sometimes complicated. Despite their differences they were crazy for each other. Now the movie officially takes place during the 40's and that was during the time of segregation and Noah had an African American friend. Also when Noah and Allie were making love in Allies house, Allies parents come home and find them and Allies parents tell her to stay away from Noah and Noah had no choice but to leave Allie for a while. After that happened he goes off into war during World War 2 and he writes letters to Allie every day, but Allies mother hides the love letters from Noah and Allie meets Lon Hammond Jr and becomes engaged to him which is the worst mistake she makes. Then after the war Noah sees Allie again and they both have dinner together and go on a boat ride together until it starts to rain. Then they realize how much they've missed each other and make love in the house that Noah refurbished after it had been around since the early days of America. Then Allie realizes that she had to go back to Lon Hammond but Noah opposes this and asks Allie what her decision is and Allie decides to go back to Lon Hammond. When she goes back to him she tells him about Noah and their love for each other. At first Lon Hammond is angry about this but then decides to let Allie be with Noah. After this happens Noah and Allie get married and have beautiful children together and they also have grandchildren. Now they were living in a nursing home together cause Allie had Alzheimer's which is sad cause it happens to a lot of old people each year and one of the best ways to prevent Alzheimer's is to drink green tea. Every now and again though the Allie that Noah fell in love with and married comes around until the Alzheimer's Allie comes back and she loses her memory. Later that night which was their last night on Earth Noah crawls into bed with the sick Allie for he was dying as well since he had heart attacks before and to his very eyes the real Allie comes around one last time and this made Noah feel grateful. Then they both lie in bed and their souls descend into heaven. Indeed this is a very powerful and beautiful love story and one of the best love stories ever. Both sad and beautiful here.",The Notebook
143,justbob1982,Don't call it a 'chick flick',6,19 September 2015,"Version I saw: UK DVD releaseActors: 6/10Plot/script: 5/10Photography/visual style: 6/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 6/10I don't believe in 'chick flicks'. I find the term incredibly patronising to women. I believe that a good movie can appeal to anyone, and a bad film should not be just excused.On the face of it, though, The Notebook is exactly the kind of film to which people might apply the label. It's a period romance, based on a book by the formulaic author Nicholas Sparks. Ryan Gosling is the main character Noah, a laconic salt-of-the-earth manual labourer type, and Rachel McAdams is the girl from the upper classes of the American south, with whom he falls in love. The story, set in the 1930s and 40s, also has a framing device in the modern day, featuring the two of them as pensioners in a retirement home, played by Gena Rowlands and James Garner.The performances are all decent or better, although McAdams was a tad too smiley for me, slightly undermining the worst of her misfortunes. In particular, Gosling is very good at the strong but silent character, internalizing his emotions so he seems dumb to the other characters, while still making his feelings clear to the audience.The whole is far from perfect - the filming is capable but largely mediocre, the portrayal of dementia is fundamentally different to that experienced by real elderly people, and when it comes down to it, it is all so clichéd that it ends up totally predictable, sapping some of the drama - but one must be wary of being over-critical. Despite what I said above, I found myself looking for reasons not to like The Notebook, because it felt like the kind of film I should not like, as a bloke.There is actually a fair amount to like. As I said, the acting is all solid, McAdams and Gosling make a nice couple I can root for, and the clichés are at least arranged and assembled in a seamless way with good narrative flow. There are even a couple of really nice photographic touches: the opening sequence has lovely art direction, and there are some World War II scenes that are handsomely mounted. The setting also provides a welcome opportunity for some great swing jazz.The fact is that I enjoyed it, in an unchallenging, easy-watching kind of way. What's wrong with that?",The Notebook
144,irishm,"Sticky, saccharine dreck",2,28 December 2013,"I'm glad I'm not the only one who hated this one. The DVD was loaned to me by someone who watches all types of movies from the silent era to present day and whose opinion I respect. I had heard good things about it from others as well and yet I procrastinated about watching it for three months. It was as if some little voice was saying ""don't do it don't do it"" I wish I had kept listening to that little voice. The night before I was to see the DVD's owner again and did not want to lie about having watched it, I put it on. The good news is that I thoroughly cleaned the kitchen that night I couldn't bear to sit there and engage with it after the first few minutes, but I did allow it to run its course while I busied myself with useful pursuits. If I had randomly selected this film on my own, I would not have finished it.Where do I start? Well, for one thing, it's predictable. I am one of those people who can NEVER see what's coming in a plot, and for me to call this whole thing within the first 7 minutes or so is pretty damning. ""Oh, lemme guess, the old couple is the young couple and she's got dementia and he reads her their own story"". Yep. And towards the end, guess what I did? I called it again. ""Oh, lemme guess, they both die together."" Yep, right again.Maybe part of the reason I was so deeply offended is that I have married friends who are going through the dementia nightmare right now, and it's not like this at all. Gena Rowlands without a hair out of place, fully made up? C'mon. Flashing in and out of lucidity like she was on a light switch? Bull. It ain't like that in real life, folks, and to have it portrayed so cutesie-wootsie on screen is a poke in the eye to people who are really dealing with this illness. The only 'real' thing I saw was when Rowlands' character flipped out on James Garner; his reaction was the truest, most honest thing on the screen during the entire two hours.The young actors were both terrible. I've never seen either of them in anything else and I hope I never do. The script was vapid, simplistic, and contrived. It seems hell-bent on trying to FORCE viewers to feel, rather than ALLOWING them to feel. I have a soft spot for good old James Garner and I consider him the one and only light in this entire mess. Oh and I liked all the swans. One star is for Garner and the other is for the swans.",The Notebook
145,Minerva_Meybridge,Ruined by Miscasting,5,23 September 2008,"The story was mediocre. Don't rush out and buy it on DVD unless you're a guy who is totally hot for Rachel McAdams, who is stand-out beautiful in the film. What bothered me was the the obvious miscasting. James Garner plays an old Ryan Gosling and Gina Rowlands an old Rachel McAdams. Come on! What was director Nick Cassavetes thinking? I know exactly what; find his mother, Gina Rowlands a role. Had he gone with make-up for Ryan and Rachel, it would have been a far, far better. It just struck me as unbelievable, especially Garner's pairing with Gosling. They look about as much alike as Queen Elizabeth and President George. The problem was, though, that while in a book, the true identities of the ancients can be masked, seeing them, make-up or not, would have given the plot away on film. I had no problem accepting the old woman in Titanic as a rundown version of Kate Winslet. But this was too much of a stretch. Remember Saving Private Ryan, how good a job they did making Matt Damon not only look old, but make him look like an old Tom Hanks? Another fouled movie was Norma Jean and Marilyn, where Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino both play Marilyn Monroe, which drew a big, ""Huh?"" from me.I also found the present-day aspects of this film way too depressing. I get the undying husbandly love and all, but to go from alluring to Alzheimer's in one fell swoop was just unnecessarily cruel. In book form it's one thing. We can conceive of people growing old, their minds wandering off into oblivion, but the fantasy seemed to have gotten mixed in with reality TV. And their deciding to die together all at once without any medical aids stretched all credibility.One last comment about the outfit Rachel McAdams wore when she revisited Noah, a white dress with red trim, red hat, red earrings, red gloves. Two thumbs up for costume designer, Karyn Wagner! She had Rachel dressed to the nines, which, by the way, was not my rating for this film.",The Notebook

I just don't, it's not me ever. Yet this film got me. This movie was so wonderfully executed, its story so involving, that it just had me sucked in.It feels like you've watched a 15 hour film (not in a bad way) by the end, because you get a feeling of knowing these characters so very well and caring for them so much.

148,danjakubik,A very romantic and visually stunning film,9,20 January 2010,"Director Nick Cassavetes, famous son of the admired film director John Cassavetes, has created an impressive film. The story is based on a first time novelist's best selling book. Though there are some weaknesses in the story, the film is filled with artistic visual delights from beginning to end. It's a love story of the American South told in flashback. By a quarter of the way into the film, I was hooked, and being familiar with this particular storytelling technique, made a successful prediction, one that connects the present with the past, in the film. This did not lessen my enjoyment of the film. As a romantic, this film was definitely ""pushing the right buttons"" for me.Cassavetes could be accused of pushing the romantic look a little too far in this film. I'm a natural born romantic, so the look of the film had me captivated from the first few minutes. Cinematography and art direction are outstanding to create a very convincing romantic look for the film.About half way into the film, I predicted this would become a new favorite film of mine.

149,AmyJenson1995,"If you're a bird, I'm a bird",10,22 February 2016,"As I'm a romantic person, I have seen a lot of romantic dramas and The Notebook has a very special resonance within me.There are so many romantic movies in the market which feel redundant and not particularly bringing memorable souvenirs. But the Notebook is one of those films which is touching your deep soul because its story reflects what true, real love is and it can trump everything.The Notebook tells the story of Noah and Ellie, two sweet souls who comes from entirely different worlds. He is a poor blue collar worker who lives in a small South Carolina town. She is a rich heiress from Charleston. They were never meant to be a couple but they fall in love and founded an amazing family despite the odds and their social ranks differences. Their story is told through an old man in an hospice in our nowadays era who is reading his own notebook to a fellow female resident struggling with dementia. It turns out that the old man is Noah, the female resident is Ellie and he is actually recounting their own love story so she could remember how much in love they are. They have 3 children and two grandchildren.It's not the first time the theme of two people crazily loving each other despite their social ranks is used to make a movie but I felt transported by the grace of the actors and the feel good sensation transpiring from this sweet couple Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are forming. I could feel they shared some complicity even if I found out they were not very friendly to each other during the shooting but at the end they made it work.There is no wonder this movie achieved a huge success and if you have the romantic fiber as I do, you will certainly cry especially at the end.",The Notebook

151,cwrdlylyn,"THE NOTEBOOK: Above-Average Romantic Drama, But It Becomes Trite When It Tries Too Hard...",7,23 March 2006,"THE NOTEBOOK Normally I avoid any movie that is overly romantic or seems especially geared towards females... no offense to those that enjoy them but for me they usually come off as annoyingly trite. However, the hoopla that revolved around THE NOTEBOOK made me curious to see what all the buzz, hype, and admiration was about.THE NOTEBOOK tells the love story of Allie and Noah... two people from opposite sides of the tracks who fall deeply in love over one summer. The story is bookended with older versions of the characters, played by James Garner and Gena Rowlands, sharing the story of their love... however, in her old age Allie has lost her memory. Noah, known as Duke when he's older, tells her their love story every day in the hopes of bringing the love of his life back to him. The idea of bookending the film with the older versions of the characters gives the film a unique approach... but in the end, for me, it just got in the way of what is a truly great love story.THE NOTEBOOK is only truly alive when it focuses on the story of their young love, played wonderfully by Ryan Gosling and the always magnetic Rachel McAdams. Though their courtship and trials are often clichéd, the romantics are elevated by the wonderful performances of these great actors. The scene in which they first fall in love walking down the streets after seeing a movie is truly wonderful.Romantics work best for me when they are played in a very honest, and believable way. As soon as contrivances and over-sentimentality creeps into the picture I become disinterested or overwhelmed. The story of their young love is grand and perhaps not completely realistic... but the performances are so honest that it manages to keep the film grounded.Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling have a dynamic chemistry together whether they are fighting, playing, joking around, or making love. Every emotion and every up-and-down of their relationship is beautifully realized. McAdams continues to impress me (has anyone seen anything besides a great, engaging performance come from her... cuz I haven't) and Gosling was great as the male lead (it helps that he's not traditionally good looking or overtly ""charming"" and ""suave""). The supporting work from Joan Allen is very strong as well as Allie's overprotective, oppressive mother. Her scene with Allie in the car at the end is wonderfully played.However, despite valiant efforts from the great Gena Rowlands and James Garner... the bookends ultimately cap off the picture on a bad note. I won't give away the full ending, but something about it was just wrong. The editing and cuts in one scene especially felt incredibly awkward and out of place. And the whole situation in the end really felt far too contrived and emotionally manipulative for the audience.I'm someone who shuts down emotionally as soon as a film feels like it's trying to make me cry as opposed to just letting me go along on a genuine emotional ride. This is what ultimately hurts the movie. The manipulative aspect of the bookended structure.Still, the film is better then your average romantic drama. It has enough genuine moments to give the film some merit (all provided in the flashback portions, which thankfully make up most of the film). I can appreciate the heights that THE NOTEBOOK aspired to reach, and it truly does in some moments. But Nick Cassavettes, the film's director, should be carefully of reaching too far... b/c he makes that mistake a few times in this good, but not perfect film.... B- ...",The Notebook

The kiss on the lake in the pouring rain is one of the greatest movies kisses of all time. You can skip this film entirely, and just google the kiss. I bet it is on youtube.

To the doubters love like that can be real, I've got a friend who's mom started getting sick about a decade ago, his dad still cares for her and takes her out for a walk most days even though she today is almost totally blind.

159,mfisher452,A love story wrapped in a dementia gimmick,5,28 March 2005,"If you're a teenage girl who's just a sucker for a love story no matter how soppy, or anyone who checks his/her brain at the door of a theater showing one, read no further. You won't like this review.I understand this is an adaptation of a novel. If it's true to the book, I'm not sure I want to read it. Maybe this is a trend in Hollywood movie marketing: A triple package, a movie that will 1) appeal to the all-important 18-35-year-old female viewer with a passionate love story; 2) also try to boost attendance among movie-going geezerdom and their aging Baby Boomer children by wrapping the love story in a dementia gimmick; and 3) cram an R movie into a PG-13 rating so teenagers can see it without their (ugh!) parents.The main plot line is a fairly pedestrian, fairly predictable love story: Poor boy from Seabrook, NC (Ryan Gosling) meets spirited, strong-willed rich girl (Rachel McAdams) from the city, poor boy loses rich girl, poor boy makes good, formerly poor boy gets rich girl. There is nothing in particular to distinguish the story except the gimmick, which is that the story is told in flashback; it is read from a NOTEBOOK (get it?) written by Allie, the woman in the love story, but it is sixty years later; now she is played by Gena Rowlands and she has moderate to severe dementia, presumably Alzheimer's disease (there are many causes of dementia, but most lay people don't know that; to most of the clueless general public, dementia and Alzheimer's disease are synonymous, aren't they?). Her husband Noah (now played by James Garner), who so adores his wife that he lives in her nursing home although he doesn't need to, reads the notebook to her over a period of days. It is hinted that this is only the latest of many such readings, but she doesn't remember any of it, you see, so each reading is like the first; neither does she recognize any of her family more than occasionally. While this is, in fact, a worthy subject for a book or a film, the depiction of this woman's dementia is ludicrously bogus. The way she behaves isn't true to life, it's arranged to suit the plot. No one with dementia acts the way she does. I wonder if the novel treated the woman's dementia with this much absurd inaccuracy. (Judging by his screen credits, Nicholas Sparks's stock in trade is treacly love stories.) There are (at the very least) two other scenes that also suggest that the producer didn't bother to hire a technical adviser for the medical parts of this movie: Toward the end of the film, the James Garner character is wheeled out of the nursing home on a stretcher, obviously toward a waiting ambulance to take him to the hospital, and the doctor or paramedic is saying there is ""no pulse and no blood pressure."" And NO ONE is doing CPR or performing ACLS (advanced cardiac life support) on him. Anyone who watches ""ER"" knows that's a major goof. He is shown having been discharged from the hospital a few days later looking not particularly worse for his near-death experience. A few days later, in one of the movie's final scenes, the Gena Rowlands character becomes agitated and combative, which is the only scene that seems remotely realistic---until the ""doctor"" rushes in with his trusty all-purpose movie syringe ALREADY UNCAPPED, and without prepping the skin or anything, gives her ""two cc's"" of something. In a situation like that, a doctor or nurse would invariably give a certain number of ""milligrams"" of a drug. Furthermore, she was not nearly combative enough to be given anything before you would try restraint and reassurance. And then comes the climactic scene that blows the movie right out of the real world into some kind of alternative romance-novel universe: He comes to her room that night; she asks him, ""Can memories take us away together?"", he says yes and crawls into bed with her, and they both die that night. Not a dry eye in the house, right? Go look up ""mawkish.""Garner and Rowlands are durable talents who turn in great performances every time, but don't really have much to do in this film; much more screen time is given to the young actors, whose work is serviceable, especially McAdams as a fiery redhead, but they aren't really called on to endow their characters with any particular depth. The director is Nick Cassavetes, Rowlands's real-life son. Anyone who has seen his father John's idiosyncratic masterpieces will recognize that either Nick is not the talent his father was or has not yet really come into his own as a director.",The Notebook
160,MagicStarfire,"Beautiful, Beautiful Love Story",10,14 March 2006,"Films seldom make me cry, but this one sure did.This has to be one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen on film.The photography is also quite beautiful with the lakes and the moonlight on the water and the birds flying.I wish men really did love women this much, but I've never seen any evidence that they do. Nonetheless the characters, and their story grabbed me from the start.The film opens with an older man, James Garner, reading a story to an older woman, the still beautiful, Gena Rowlands, at a nursing home.We then move back into the 1940's and meet Noah and Allie, the young couple in the story, who first encounter one another at a carnival. Noah is instantly and completely smitten with Allie, but she takes a bit more convincing regarding him.Eventually, however, they are both wildly in love with one another - but there are complications. Allie comes from upper crust people, Noah does not.It seems they are destined to be parted. Allie meets another wonderful young man, Lon, while she does some nursing during WWII, while Noah loses himself in the renovation of a beautiful, old, ruined plantation house. I fell in love with that house almost as much as I did with the characters and the story.Will they cross one another's paths again, and what might be the consequences if they do? The answer to this plays out in a highly interesting way and ties in with the two older people we meet at the beginning of the film, in an unexpected and heartbreaking way.Allie is fetchingly played by the very pretty Rachel McAdams, and Noah is portrayed quite sensitively by Ryan Gosling. Ryan Gosling, whom I had never seen before, as far as I know, reminded me quite a lot of Adrian Brody - another fine actor who is excellent at playing sensitive types.This is an exceptional film of depth and beauty.10 stars out of 10 stars.",The Notebook

163,clivy,A film with the potential to be a real heartbreaker let down by sentiment and melodrama,7,22 September 2008,"Channel 4 here in the UK heavily promoted UK ""The Notebook"" over the weekend, and I was attracted by the trailer into watching it last night. The cinematography was excellent, especially the scenes of the geese on the river. The movie wonderfully captured a sense of place: I smiled at the scenes of the riverbanks and Spanish moss, and I could feel the warmth of the summer nights. I've never spent much time in South Carolina, but I spent several years living in North Central Florida, and the film does justice to the beauty of the Southern wilderness. However, the script lets down the love story. ""The Notebook"" has the potential to be a shattering film about the power of love. The flashbacks to Ally and Noah's youth, aside from the cinematography, are nothing special. They tell a story told many times before in other films and books: rich girl meets poor boy, boy loses girl, boy meets girl again, girl must choose on the eve of her wedding whether to marry for security and love or just love. It's the framing story that delivers a punch: what happens when a couple who have overcome great obstacles to be together face a terrible obstacle that can not be defeated, that destroys them not just by attacking their bodies, as old age does, but by obliterating one partner's memory and mind? The film reveals how Duke dedicates himself to his wife, living in the same residential home, reading to her from the notebook she compiled, sparking whatever residential memories remain of their life together. The contemporary scenes show the pain of their children, who Ally greets as strangers, and the torture of Duke as he continually tries to help his wife emerge from her perpetual cloud of forgetting, even for a few moments.If the film ended with Duke's witnessing Ally's confusion and terror as she struggles against him, believing him once again to be a stranger, it would be heartbreaking. Unfortunately ""The Notebook"" is diminished by melodrama and sentimentality. I'm not a medical expert but I have seen documentaries about Alzheimer's and I've read several books by Oliver Sacks: they state, as the doctor in ""the Notebook"" does, that once brain cells die, once memory begins to deteriorate, there's not much hope of it ever returning. Duke battles against the disease, as did Ally herself when she wrote the stories of their lives that he reads to her. I cried when he read his beloved Whitman to her: ""Nothing is ever really lost, or can be lost"". Whitman's lines are a tribute to Ally and Duke's lonely struggle: No birth, identity, form--no object of the world. Nor life, nor force, nor any visible thing; Appearance must not foil, nor shifted sphere confuse thy brain The body, sluggish, aged, cold--the embers left from earlier fires, The light in the eye grown dim, shall duly flame againBut the film's portrayal of dementia is more like the Keeper in Babylon 5: a force that suppresses a person's mind, that can be subdued for a few moments so that the personality can emerge intact and free for a precious short time. Indeed Ally asks how much time they have and Duke replies that the last time it was for 5 minutes.""The notebook"" would be much more powerful if it showed a flicker of recognition on Ally's face, a scene that shows she understands what Duke means to her: not an inner teenager peeping out of a aged body to yell yoo hoo before curfew kicks back in. It would also be much powerful if it resisted the maudlin ending. I could believe that Ally would remember Duke reading to her, that she would miss him, that even she was again her old self for a few moments. But their dying hand in hand and the CGI geese were slush.There's a heartbreaking story within ""The Notebook"" but the laspses into sentiment and melodrama make it another four handkerchief weepie, perfect for a Sunday afternoon matinée. A pity, because the real love story is glossed over: Duke and Ally's struggle to preserve their love in the face of oblivion.",The Notebook

I thought it was just a heartwarming love story between two young individuals of different socio-economic background. It taught me that love wins in the end. However, I did not know what consent and romanticised sexual harassment/ emotional blackmail were. The male lead does not take 'no' for an answer, and even threathens to kill himself. But people would say that it is just fiction to justify such behaviours. Well, there is nothing else I can say.",The Notebook
165,matej-trkanjec-133-920386,Love never dies,9,29 December 2011,"There are not a lot of movies that can awake powerful emotions within me, but this one certainly did it. From the very beginning I had a good feeling about it (just one scene with James Garner and I was bought). First of all, this movie has a marvelous tale. The way it develops is just magical. The shift from the past to the present et vice versa is done so well that not once have I regretted it. I was so consumed by the story that I simply didn't want this movie to end. The acting is superb! Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams were brilliant in their roles. The aging of their characters for teenagers to grown persons, I had a feeling, was done without a bit of difficulty at their end. The characters they played simply fitted them in every way. But, I must say that Garner has, as had Gosling, magnificently played his role. The emotions. That is the most powerful asset of this movie. Happiness, sadness, love... It's all there. The movie touches one not because of the scene itself but because of everything one sees before the scene. The movie made me remember my love, and it made me cry. The only reason I gave it 9/10 is the predictability. Somewhere at the middle of the movie I just knew how it would end, but I did not expect the ending itself. Watch this with your girlfriend/wife/husband/boyfriend and remember that true love never dies.",The Notebook
166,moviefan2003va,Good,8,13 September 2004,This is a good movie. It is predictable but is better than something you will see on Lifetime network. The pairing of Gosling and McAdams is simply chemistry in a bottle. This makes the movie something more than it should be. I'm glad to see directors/writers/producers who understand that you just can't say two people are in love but that you need to give them dialogue and a foundation for their love. This is where the movie Pearl Harbor failed and this movie succeeds. The movie is bookended by veteran actors Garner and Rowlands who are superb.These are clearly breakout roles for McAdams who also had success in Mean Girls and especially for Gosling.8/10,The Notebook

The writer, director and producer should all be held liable....a law suit should be filed against them for ALL the pain and suffering they have caused me and no doubt many others!I failed to remember all the tears that came running down my face before, but I was quickly reminded this time again. This movie is very emotional. To the Writer, producer and director....thank you for such a lovely movie.... I'm just mad because Now I have to pay for an appointment with a therapist so I can stop sobbing.In summary It really is a great movie but very emotional so get ready for the waterfalls coming from your eyes...by the way see it with a girl, then you can get to first base by comforting her while she is crying!",The Notebook
168,vladymirror,behind every love there is a story (forget the great),6,20 January 2006,"The reason I saw The Notebook was because I really liked Rachel McAdams in Wedding Crashers. She is a doll, isn't she? Rachel was so good in Wedding Crashers so I wanted to see her in another movie.To tell you the truth I'm not quite sure about this one. The Notebook is definitely not a great movie  that's for sure. I haven't read the book but I got the feeling that the director was picking from different passages of the book in order to give us maximum information in a very limited time. I am referring to the second act with all the many short stories  the war, house, new boyfriend and girlfriend, and so on and so on. The acting was also not that good. Rachel in a way was OK but Ryan Gosling acted too boyish for this role. There wasn't a good chemistry between the 2 leads. The whole cast with the exception of the old Noah wasn't convincing. Not to mention the ending was so very contrived.However this is a love story and as such some fantasies are allowed. From a bird's view this is a film about the time old question: should one follow the heart or should one follow the head? Which body organ is more reliable when making decisions? Choosing between what's good for the soul or what's good for the body. Passion or reason. Ideal versus money. Tough question I know. But what I know is that the movie also won't give you a convincing answer. I guess there isn't one.There are other good love stories out there that are much better than The notebook. One that comes to mind from the new ones is The Constant Gardener. The Notebook is a romantic melodrama that has its moments I guess. If it so happens that you might even cry, take a look at yourself in the mirror, take your time and think what's wrong withyou.6 stars out of 10",The Notebook

If you don't cry at the end, some questions are gonna be raised. Suddenly, you're not sensitive, and the relationship drops a rung on the sex ladder.This 2 hour long movie depicts a love story read by an aged husband to his wife who has a disease (something like alzheimers) and she forgets things easily. He reads to her their love story, and every time he does, she remembers just a little bit more about the relationship they have.Not my kind of movie, but I gave it a 7 out of 10, because it was good nonetheless. I'm just not a crying for every movie kind of guy, I felt sincerity for the ending, and my eyes were on the verge of watering, but it just didn't work for me.

I have looked in every bookstore that I come across for a great love story, but I can't find one. I want to know where I can find ""the notebook"". It's an amazing tale about life and love. It's got moments that make you laugh, cry and just be happy for who you are.Secondly, I'm so proud that i'm Canadian, and the fact that we have many talented actors, such as Mike Myers, Jim Carrey, Keanu Reeves...oh ya, Rachael McAdams and Ryan Gosling.I've seen Ryan Gosling in ""Murder by Numbers"" with Sandra Bullock, and although he was hott in that movie, he kind of had a devilish look to him, but when I saw him in ""The Notebook"" he was like a saint, love his smile by the way.This movie is great, love Gina Rowlands and James Garner too, both were great. Wonderful story, fantastic writing, the acting was very incredible.

Its handling of a gentle subject matter the range of emotions the actors use is outstanding. James Gardner surprises us near the end of the movie with so much depth that you truly suspend all disbelief and feel as if you are secretly peeking into someone's room during a private conversation.The movie may be hard to watch for some and will pull at your heartstrings at every opportunity while not forgetting to make you laugh at other moments.As with any movie, there is always place for tweaks but this is about as perfect as a movie gets.

172,Scorching,The best among the Sparks adapted movies,7,24 January 2005,If you have previously watched films that were based on a Nicholas Sparks' novel than you can pretty much get the tone of this movie. It really has the same framework on this one. People have been saying that thus novel by far was the best from Sparks and there was a good chance that it would translate in to a good film. Well among the three movies I got to say that this movie is indeed the best one as it had the best story. The characters too were far more complex and developed.I thought the acting of the veteran actors was stronger than their younger counterparts. Even if they only had a limited screen time and were doing very little they were very effective especially at the latter part of the film. The young ones did a good job especially from Gosling. Unfortunately for McAdams I had only seen Mean Girls a few short weeks ago and it was a little hard for me to see her doing two completely different roles.Definitely a good tearjerker of a film & I was expecting a lot considering the rave reviews of those who have seen it before me. It did just enough for my expectations to be met.,The Notebook
173,dixxjamm,"interesting, touching and ...crappy",4,10 April 2006,"Mixed feelings about this one. Saw it on HBO,cuz I would never pay a cinema ticket for a movie with R.McAdams again after Red Eye.The dialog had its moments and the filming was pretty nice.Story was somewhat corny, but it was suppose to be primarily romantic, so it didn't bother me much.Where the movie really kinda falls apart is that it almost never puts emphasis on the complexity of the human emotions.It is almost like the director was going: ""Ok,ok,this is where the audience feels romantic and identifies with everything,let's not complicate things any further and stick to that.Too bad, because the movie might have had potential.For ex., there is a scene where Noah and Mrs ""Born with a silver spoon in my mouth"" have a final argument and discussion outside the parents house.I liked the dialog and the acting, only the whole thing stops where it was getting interesting.Some more ""I hate you""-s,""Go to hell"" and some more hysteria would have been more realistic and maybe some long shots insisting on the characters emotions would have created a more complete picture. The same pattern of ""stop here,it will get hazy and confuse the audience"" is followed throughout the movie, culminating with a final scene between Allie and Lon where he is behaving with the utmost nobility and selfishness and the scene ends....right there.My point is, the characters are...well...incomplete and to some extent unrealistic and one-sided. Too bad, because the subject was treated decently otherwise and had some interesting issues.It deserved a 5 or 6 from me actually, but R.McAdams, as always, manages to wake the subjective beast in me.Will somebody stop casting this woman, please !!!!!!",The Notebook

Then a lot of people were talking and talking about it. So I gave it a chance and watched it and thought it was really good. I'm recommending for everybody to watch it. It is a heartwarming tearjerker, but I had no tears, I just felt the emotion.Rachael McAdams is Hollywood's ""Next Big Thing"". I saw her in ""Mean Girls"" and then ""Red Eye"", now after seeing her in this, I know she can act. She's pretty hot and I know she'll be doing more movies.

It's narration was good from the standpoint of James Garner who is a fine actor in his own! Rachel Mcadams' character was good also. She basically stole the show. I was trying to keep up with the story of it and couldn't follow much of the characters. The ending of it, however, was much of a surprise.

It is a necessary date night/Valentines Day/anniversary movie to remind us all that true love can yet be imperfect and in fact does exist. When I saw this in theaters, I was crying very hard. At the time, I was NOT a person who cried during movies (that is completely opposite now). Its not just about the way it makes you cry though, it teaches anyone a deep lesson about how even the greatest love has flaws and that it has to be worked on every single day, and is always worth it in the end. I can't imagine that this movie will ever be outdone in this century, and I firmly believe that it is the new Gone With The Wind...minus the extra 2 hours. This is the one and only time I think I will ever say that the movie is better than the book.

178,katydid4819,A True Love Story From Beginning To End,7,4 July 2004,"You don't find many movies like The Notebook. Sure, there are many loves stories, too many, actually. They all follow the same formula and you know the ending from the time the lights go down. The Notebook is also a love story; it's a formulaic movie that you already know the end of. What makes it different is that it's the story of one couples relationship from start to finish. 	Allie (Rachel McAdams) and Noah (Ryan Gosling) meet at a carnival the summer that Allie is seventeen. She's high society spending the summer in Seabrook. He doesn't have a dime to his name. It's the classic tale of love, the rich girl and the boy her parents don't approve of. Despite, they fall in love. Fast-forward twenty years, Allie's about to marry to a man of money. But that wouldn't be fitting in this story of true love, would it?	The movie is based off the novel by Nicholas Sparks (A Walk To Remember, Message In A Bottle). Like his previous two book-into-movie adaptations, the focus is on the story and not the characters. These stories do not specialize in developing well-rounded characters. To enjoy The Notebook, you have to suspend reality in this aspect. Noah appears to the audience as the perfect boy, who's just too nice, too sweet. His character is always staring at Allie with sad, puppy dog eyes, even after twenty-five years. But, if you accept that this is the character, Ryan Gosling's performance is good. It's strong and believable. Rachel McAdams who's previous film this year was Mean Girls, takes a complete turn form that and gives the best performance of the movie. This may be because her character is the written better than anyone else's. 	The true achievement of The Notebook is in the portrayal of first love, the summer romance. McAdams and Gosling have a great chemistry that is not just a physical attraction but, even in their quarrels, they still radiate a deep friendship that helps underline the point of The Notebook. Fortunately, the portion of the movie with McAdams and Gosling is more than the part with the older versions of themselves (James Garner and Joan Allen). Garner is reading from the notebook to Allen. She is stricken with Alzheimers and he's convinced that if he reads the story to her enough, his Allie will remember. It's touching and sweet but not as accurately done as the former. From mistakes in the medical aspects of it, to the leap of faith the last scene makes, it comes up more scattered than the rest. 	It's not an amazing movie but from the material it's based on, it could have been much worse. The excellent performances by the whole cast and the heart that is shown make it a decent film. It's not one that will stand the test of time as an amazing love story but it's worth seeing. Though it's a tearjerker, it's also hopeful in the best way.",The Notebook
179,IanIndependent,Touching,7,28 August 2020,"This is a well made film with genuine poignancy. The story is well told without being over melodramatic, the characters are realistic and portrayed by the main actors very well. Rachel McAdams comes across very natural and Joan Allen plays a key role really well although the small side story about her characters past is not needed. I think it's there to explain Allie's mothers harsh actions but to be honest a some mothers would do anything to make sure their daughter didn't make a mistake. This is also a film were Ryan Gosling is well cast. I find Gosling is either good or not really good. This is because he always plays Ryan Gosling. So, if you want the keep it under control, cool, silent type he's right. Anything else and you are left wanting. He is not really good in showing emotion which you think would make this a film not best suited to the actor. However, because McAdams is is so full on lively and emotional his laid back approach plays well as the other side of the same coin.I could have done without the really implausible very end and there were a couple of moments ie Allie's mothers revelation already stated that a a bit too much or too saccharine.Definitely a film to watch if you are after a bit of romance well acted and presented.",The Notebook

If one grew up in the south in the 1950s there would be a certain speech, and dignity that I felt not one of the main characters brought across. If they were going to use these actors, they should have put it in a different location, which, also, would have changes a lot more.

182,flickernatic,Titanic minus the icebergs - drowning in its own slush!,2,11 August 2008,"One of the many problems with this movie is the implausibility and predictability of the story (maybe that's two of the many problems!). Girl takes up with guy from the wrong side of the tracks. They are separated by her parents and by war; she takes up with a worthy suitor; but she eventually returns to his arms. Kind of Titanic minus the ship, the icebergs and most of what made that movie so good. They live happily ever after until she winds up with dementia in the Arnold Schwarzenneger Home for Retired Very Wealthy Californian Gentlefolk and forgets everything, including him. He jogs her intermittently back into the present by reading from a mysterious book which is (hey, we would never have guessed that!) their story. They dance, just like they used to, and indulge in heart-shredding exchanges of the 'I will always lurve you' variety. There is a point about 10 minutes from the end when you think (with relief) that the movie is over. It certainly would have been a good place to stop; there's nothing more to add to the story. But no. The director has to go on and rub in the schmaltz just in case we thought the movie might display some subtlety. The guy wangles his way past the night attendant at the Home and into his demented partner's bed where they expire together. A perfect ending - for them, perhaps, but not for us.

The Notebook is one of the best romance films I've seen. It tells the story in flashback of Noah and Allie. They both come from very different backgrounds but that doesn't stop them falling in love. Of course Allie being from a rich upper class family,her parents discourage the relationship between her and Noah. They portray a love that every girl would love to have. It seems that no matter what paths they both go down they are always drawn back to each other. Noah never stopped loving Allie and vice a versa. I love it when they are both on the boat together feeding the ducks, it really is a beautiful scene. In the film you see Noah as now an older man reading to a woman who is now the older Allie,so it is showing that their love never died and they stick by each other til the end. I really think people enjoy this film because it really portrays true love and the true meaning of finding that one person you're destined to be with. Have the tissues ready!",The Notebook
184,MeloDee,Pretty good for a romance film.,7,14 August 2006,"I'm definitely not an expert on romance movies, because I tend to generally avoid the romance genre- in both films and books. To avoid cheesiness, predictability, ""syrup"" and endless stereotypes I've always found it more tasteful to combine romance with another genre. That way, you avoid a story's unrealistic obsession with the two main characters. That's not to say that I hate the romance genre altogether- there are some exceptions and times when a story seems to be built at least half-realistically and can actually move me.In this case, although I'd put on my ""skeptic glasses"" I at the same time had a lot more expectation than I usually would because I'd heard so many great things about the film.At first, when I see Noah, I think ""What's the matter with this guy?"" and was about to write him off as a caricature, but his character made me laugh and with a little hesitation I accepted him as actually being realistic. I related to Allie's reaction to him maybe a little more than most because I would've treated him exactly the same way! Through the beginning of the film they kiss...a lot. Again my skeptical goggles are on, and I'm starting to suspect that this is another cheesy romance based on lust carefully- or perhaps, not so carefully- disguised as love, and patiently wait for the characters to mature. On the other hand, I think, they are teenagers, and just because they're horny doesn't mean they don't know what love is. Additionally, I would expect a bit more than that from the intelligent and sometimes sassy Allie and the bat crazy but pretty down to earth Noah. (No, seriously, he's crazy).Anyway, the movie continues on. I don't know if I'm particularly enthralled by the plot, but the actor's and actress's performances are flawless as far as I can see. Especially Ryan Gosling's. The way he looked at Rachel McAdams was a perfect combination of awe and longing, and it made us really believe that what we were seeing was real.Back to the plot: Some of the morals in the story are questionable, but when I say things like that I always battle with question in my mind of whether or not the actions of the characters are always meant to teach us a lesson, or whether or not some of the time they're simply there to display reality. Yes, there are times when Allie could've been more sensible, but really, how many of us haven't been insensible from time to time? As for whether or not true love could've sprang from Allie and Noah's ""summer romance"" is questionable as well. Perhaps even the intervention of Allie's mother in their relationship wasn't as detestable as some might immediately begin to think. I loved this movie in that it didn't take advantage of pathetic stereotypes and create supporting characters just MADE to be hated. It didn't have the ""tunnel vision"" that some romances have, where they almost force you to root for only the two lovebirds by making everyone else a total jerk. Instead everyone had some depth in them, and even though we didn't ""vouch"" for them all the time, we could understand and relate to them.Either way, sometimes they say ""the end justifies the means"" and the ending of the movie was what really touched me. No, I'm not going to spoil it for you, and no, I didn't shed any tears- I very, very rarely do over movies- but this really made me think somehow.This wasn't ""the best romance ever made"" for me- or even really close to it- but it was an enjoyable enough film to watch and it had some pretty emotional moments to it. It even had a little comedy in it (though I must warn that I tend to laugh a lot at films). Again, I must repeat, the performances of Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams were flawless and actually very amazing, and that was the main enjoyment for me.",The Notebook

In any case, there's no denying that The Notebook is a compelling motion picture, and a very emotional kind of experience. It's what many would call a ""tear-jerker"" (an accurate description, considering how emotional the film is) but, at least in this case, calling it that it not a bad thing at all.The film tells the story of Noah (James Garner as an adult, and Ryan Gosling as the younger version) and Allie. (Gene Rowlands in modern times, and Rachel McAdams during her younger years.) It's the year 2000, and Allie is suffering of dementia, something that is affecting her memory. With hopes of making her better, Noah is reading her from an old notebook, which recounts their story together; how they met, how they fell in love, and how they eventually ended up together. They met in America just before WWII; Noah was a working class teenager, while Allie belonged to a wealthy family. As most will be able to guess, their differences in terms of social classes became an issue, especially when Allie's mother (Joan Allen) found about their relationship. This lead to their break up, but fortunately for the both of them, destiny made them find each other again after the war, and just before Allie married an equally wealthy and undeniably charming soldier. (James Marsden.) If there's a reason why The Notebook worked so great for me, it's because it's so damned emotional. The story is predictable, as well the twists and turns the scriptwriters keep throwing at the audience, but the movie is presented in such a manner that it's not hard to feel for the characters and want them to end up together. Technically, it's brilliant - pre-WWII America is presented very accurately, and the film provides with such beautiful photography that it's hard not to fall in love with it. It's a beautiful-looking film, and as it's usually the case, it tells the story of two equally pretty people who just can't seem to be together. Their romance is pretty straightforward stuff - I actually thought at times it was too dramatic and that it resembled a cheap soap opera a little too much - but what made the story so compelling was the contrast between their early life and the situation in the 21st century. It may be due to my fears or to how I feel towards the topic, but the fact that Allie couldn't recognize Noah and that he just kept reading at her and loving her... OK, let's just say it's pretty powerful stuff.If there's a genre that depends a lot on performances, it's the romantic drama; if your leads don't have any chemistry between each other, if they can't sell the romance to the audience, then your movie is pretty much screwed. Fortunately, that's not the case in here. Rachel McAdams is beautiful and compelling; she turns Allie into a charming, likable kind of character, the kind of girl you just want to be happy. Ryan Gosling is equally good, although I felt at times his interpretation of Noah lacked a little characterization, a little charm. In any case, he does have chemistry which McAdams, making every encounter between them bloom with passion. As the older versions of this characters, James Garner and Jena Rowlands are really good too although, at least for me, it was hard to believe those two were the same people who appear in the flashbacks. They just don't look alike or even feel alike.Something that bothered me a little and that many critics have mentioned about the film, is that it feels a little restrained. Considering hat subject matter, and the fact that it's a very dramatic, slow-moving, emotional and occasionally sad, I don't think many teenagers would want to watch the movie. So why then the PG-13 rating? Every time Noah and Allie were involved in a sex scenes, tricky camera-work was used to make sure no nudity was shown, and the actors even are positioned in such a way that it looks forced and awkward, only to make sure, again, that they don't show any skin. If you're going to have a film that contains quite a bit of sexuality and that doesn't appeal to many underage viewers, it doesn't make any sense to restrain it. Many members of the audience won't even notice this, but it definitely bothered me.As most of my readers may have already noticed, The Notebook is flawed, but a movie doesn't have to be a flawless masterpiece in order to be enjoyable. The Notebook is a romantic drama, and in order to succeed, it only has to do a couple of things: provide with solid romantic moments, have a believable leading couple and, if possible, make its viewers cry. I can say that this film achieved all three objectives, and that if you don't cry while watching it, especially during the last few scenes, you just don't have a soul. OK, so the filmmakers might be cheating - sometimes it's almost as if Nick Cassavettes and his team were trying to throw pepper-spray at the audience in order to make them cry - but the film is presented in such an elegant, compelling fashion, that you won't notice any of its flaws until well after the end credits.",The Notebook

I expect/hope to see her in quite a few more movies.

He's separated from her but writes her a letter each day for a year. The letters are bound in a notebook and story is read in the present day by an elderly man (James Garner) ""Noah"" telling the tale to a fellow nursing home resident (Gena Rowlands) ""Allie"" who suffers from dementia and can't remember anyone.

The older couple was very believable too.  James Garner and Gena Rowlands portrayed them so well.  By far this is the best movie of 2004.  I loved the way the story unfolded. Another thing I liked about the movie was that there were fresh new faces- Ryan Goslin and Rachel McAdams.  Rachel in particular was very beautiful.

They were definitely not afraid to go down and dirty! Cinematography was great. The mellow capture of certain scenes was breathtaking, but Atonement still has my vote.Now the fun begins! The movie offers excruciatingly painful editing. It seemed as if... whoa, like where did this come from. Definitely, editing had me a little dizzied.The actions of the characters were a little dumb.

But what elevates this movie from others in the genre is the performances by Ryan Gosling and Rachel Mcadams . You truly believe they are in love. That's why the part of the movie set during the 1940s works. What doesn't work is the modern day story set in a hospital. It just feels distracting , butting in the middle. All the time you're just itching to get back to the story in 1940s. It also leads to a long drawn ending where you wish they had ended the movie long before.The notebook maybe overly sentimental and manipulative for some.

201,marlyly,"Beautiful love story, but by no means perfect",6,4 October 2008,"After putting off watching this film for many years, I finally bought the DVD earlier this year and decided to lose my 'the Notebook virginity' and take the plunge - now I have seen this film way more many times than I care to count, and am still loving every moment of it.The story revolves around Allie Hamilton, a fun loving, hard-working, 17 year old girl from a very rich family, who, during a summer holiday at Seabrook, falls deeply in love with Noah Calhoun, a poor boy who loves her back with all his heart. But summer romances cannot last forever and eventually Allie's mother, Anne Hamilton, decides to interfere, telling her daughter that she was not born and brought up to waste her life on trash like Noah. The family leave the next day and return to the city, and although Noah writes to Allie everyday for the next day, not one of the 365 letters reached Allie because her mum, Anne, would hide them away. Eventually, believing all is over between her and Noah, Allie falls in love with the rich, intelligent and successful Lon Hammond Jr, and agrees to marry him, but her destiny was inter wined with Noah's, and it won't let her escape that easy.The film is a romance, but whilst that category often induces terms such as 'cheesy, soppy, predictable, clichéd' etc, 'the Notebook' breaks every one of them and gives a refreshing and different account of a story told too many times over for many, many years. The script is incredibly well written (except for a few awkward parts) considering it's genre, and the parts acted brilliant by all involved. Stand out performance must go to Rachel McAdams and Joan Allen (as Allie and her mother), although Ryan Gosling, James Marsden, David Thornton and Starletta DuPois probably all deserve a mention too.(slight spoilers in this paragraph) One of my main faults with this film is that the Noah we see in the present time (the old Noah) is a completely different person to the Noah we see in the story. There are no similarities between the two characters, except for their undying love for Allie, and although I understand that this may be to prevent the first time viewers from guessing the ending, it also takes away from the film by making it seem far less genuine.I do love this film, but it is by no means one of the greatest films ever made. It is a beautiful tale of love, and the film grows on you and continues to surprise you on subsequent viewings 9which really is the mark of a good film), but being in the genre of romance it is rather limited, and although a very heart-warming and sad story, it will not be one to change the face of the film industry for years to come, but instead will be a film that many will enjoy, though no one could claim it to be the greatest film ever to be made.",The Notebook

It was further hurt by the fact that I was forced into watching it by my girlfirend, and at that I was forced to watch it late at night when I wanted to go to bed. Also, she fell asleep 10 minutes in to the movie, but I already felt I had to watch the entire thing. That being said, the movie was not entirely unpleasant. I can't really pick out anything that I loved about the movie (although I did feel James Garner gave a very good performance), I didn't necisarily find anything wrong with the movie either.

204,Dick-42,"An Ordinary Story of Young Love, and a Heartbreaking Story of Mature Love",9,13 October 2005,"Other reviewers have been fascinated by a fairly standard Hollywood story of a youthful courtship. It's good (I'd say a 7 on the scale of 10), but not the real story of the movie.An elderly man (whom I can relate to because I'm writing this on my 81st birthday) has an interest in a co-resident of his nursing home, an old woman who seems ""out of it,"" but who responds somewhat to the story he reads to her each day -- of the young lovers. (That story, of course, is told in flashbacks, and constitutes maybe 90 percent of the movie. I can relate to it, too, because the lovers are just about the ages of my wife, of 60 years, and me.) However, a second story also develops between the contemporary elderly people, that to me is the heart of the movie. My wife called it a tear jerker. I agreed, though I hadn't shed any tears. Nevertheless, unlike most movies that are forgettable, this one remains vivid, and doesn't lose its punch with time. When I thought about it the next day, I was, indeed, moved emotionally. It's a beautiful story, and if you don't get it, I'm sorry. You need to be alert to catch the point -- or ""punch line"" -- as the ""Notebook"" is shown in a close-up near the end.A beautiful, and marvelous movie! It loses just a point in the ratings because of unnecessary, though implied, sex -- not characteristic of movies of the 40s. (The CODE, you know.)",The Notebook

206,FilmSchoolWriter,An absolutely beautiful tear jerker.,9,17 December 2005,"""The Notebook"" isn't a movie for everyone. Face it, it's a love story geared towards young people so I don't expect everyone to love it as much as I do. But if you are the sort of person who loves a tear-jerking romantic movie, rent ""The Notebook"".The acting in ""The Notebook"" is surprisingly good and is probably the main reason that ""The Notebook"" is not just another romantic chick flick that you watch and then forget. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams have some of the best on screen chemistry that I have ever seen, only beaten by Audrey Hepburn and Richard Peck's chemistry from ""Roman Holiday"". And even then it's a close call. They show the passion, love and lust that their characters have for each other with perfect accuracy. Their emotions are transmitted straight back to you and you don't forget them in a hurry. James Garner is stunning as an older Noah, his devotion to an Allie who doesn't even remember him is touching and his reactions to her are perfect. None of the leads are cursed with delivering excessively cheesy lines. And if there are any cheesy lines, they are beautifully disguised as authentic emotions.I loved ""The Notebook"" and really, really recommend it. For anyone who enjoyed ""Moulin Rouge!"" or ""Titanic"", you are pretty much guaranteed to enjoy ""The Notebook"". And even if you didn't like either of those movies, you will still enjoy ""The Notebook"" -- I promise.",The Notebook

The story was beautiful and I can not think of one way I would change it. This is not simply a movie about two people falling in love and living happily ever after. It is a movie that gives you a view of how two people in love can find their way back together after a cruel separation. If you have not seen this movie in the theater, I encourage you to rent it when it comes out on DVD. I know it's a love story, and you may be figuring that it may not be worth your time, but I can assure you that there is nothing typical about it.

210,ilikepuppies,Directed by you and I.,5,14 January 2006,"What portion of the ultimate makeup of a Hollywood product is driven directly by the viewer? An interesting topic for debate, and this film has a lot to say within the context of that debate.One can easily see what happened here. The end is so obviously incompatible with the rest of the story it jars. We suddenly have this business about love's miracles and God. The book this film was based on has no death, a detail which test audiences will subconsciously sniff out nearly every time. And I believe that's what happened here.Try to quickly think of a modern film drama with no instance of death within. It's not that easy a task. That's because as the lineage of film progresses, more and more is demanded by the viewer to qualify a movie as engaging drama. Death lends a tone of seriousness that is nearly prerequisite these days. This tacked on variation of the original ending was clearly (at least partially) created in our own imaginations, that of the viewer.So what we end up with is a film that is ostensibly about love, inwardly about memories that ends with an incongruous statement about God, via beautiful death. The love element is provided by our book's author (Sparks), the memory slant by the filmmakers and the ending thanks to you and I.A side note: The overly sugared down tone of the film has been criticized as too safe and wholesome, but it works effectively for me considering that these memories are from the minds of the elderly and presented as an elderly person might wish.",The Notebook

Look, all you guys out there that raved about this film are a sorry excuse for the male gender. Now it's your turn to have her sit through a movie. Go ahead and torment her with films like ""Roger Dodger"", ""Zomibe"", ""Cobra"", ""Die Hard"", ""Slumber Party Massacre"",""Nightmare On Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors"", or ""Vice Academy.""

217,JimmyZappa,Notebook Delivers,9,18 January 2009,"Where a lot of romance movies fail, this one delivers. I think the reason why this is so is because of two simple things: 1. The character chemistry interaction usually seems superfluous and fake.2. The reason why THAT is so is because we don't experience growth between those characters through interaction.Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are perfect candidates for this movie. McAdams is not only beautiful, she doesn't act like an airhead like you find in most romantic movies (think Disney channel sappy romance). As childish as she acts in the beginning, we realize she's young and wants to experience all the things teenagers do: fun, excitement, and love. As a guy, I didn't roll my eyes when I saw her whine or crushed. I felt for her. I sympathized with her. I don't see her portrayal of Ally as some throwaway stock character, I see the Ally character as a human being. A fictional character literally brought to life. Once you get that sense of authenticity, it's not game over. It's one base covered.Ryan Gosling's character, Noah, is the second base covered. He's a charming, wild, crazy, yet likable person. For anyone who's been in love or at least knows what it feels like, we can understand why he does the things he does with McAdam's character in the beginning. It's a little stalker-ish, admittedly, but for a movie it works. Like any romance novel, he's a rugged good looking character whose really in love. But like McAdams, Gosling's physical and verbal expressions feel authentic. He's not the typical guy who hates the girl at first then falls in love, nor is he just there for a few minutes and then suddenly there for the traditional happy ending. On that note, he's not cheesy. I think that's important to note. It's real easy to be cheesy in these type of movies, but it doesn't happen here. The dialogue is another factor to this. It hits the appropriate notes and doesn't add any to make it seem artificially mushy to get cheap ""aws"" and earn rolled eyes. It talks about the most important thing in life and all the conflicts that try to separate it, but fail. These conflicts are from Ally's mother who doesn't want her to see Noah, Ally's later fiancée, and even Ally herself. Luckily, all these are explained in the movie. They are not throw away plot devices and that was a major plus for me.My personal favorite scenes were the ones dealing with the letters, especially when Ally gets then back from her mother, and the older Ally finally remembering who Noah is. If I had to gripe, I would liked to have seen Ally's desire to paint emphasized a bit more (plus ""sneak"" into the story better) and see the young couple have a final sendoff for the viewers before we see the remainder of their lives in photos.We are taken to small destinations like the fair, the old house that gets rebuilt, and a very brief walk through World War II. But the destinations are really only background and filler, only enhancing the mood when the story feels appropriate. The scene where the 20 something year old Noah and Ally rekindle old ties in the lake then fall in love all over again when it starts to rain is a perfect example of that.All in all, what carries the story on its shoulders is the side story: the older Noah and Ally. Halfway through the movie, we finally realize its the older versions of the characters in the main story. Noah tells Ally, apparently every day, the story of how they met and came to live with each other even in an elderly home. Unfortunately, Ally suffers from dementia and doesn't remember him. She forgets but we remember. That's the most powerful element in the story.By the end, we don't feel like we just wasted our time and money. At least I didn't anyway. In my opinion, this is what movies like Titanic should've been like. We see two different stories about how true love can come to anyone, no matter the circumstances. A lot of it centers on Ally and for good reason, old Noah is telling it to her to get her to remember. Both stories go happily hand in hand with each other. The authentic portrayals, appropriate direction, and wonderful writing made a perfect romance film that both guys and girls can enjoy (that is if the guys can tolerate a love story).",The Notebook

Hands down the worst casting in the movie. Gosling seemed like he *might* be able to act in a movie with a title like, say, ""Hey, Dude, Wha's Up"", but that's about it. The guy has the energy of a turnip. At one point, I thought he might possibly be a step away from being stoned.Gosling's character's on screen relationship with Rachel McAdams appeared to be relatively chemistry-free. But that might also have been due to the lame script. Some of the lines were hard to take seriously. Still, it would have been nice if Gosling, in particular, had tried. The movie reminded of a Hallmark Hall of Fame production, but with poorer production values. And the film seemed to be about the '30s and '40s as imagined by someone contemporary. Hence, there is no hesitancy about a woman sleeping with someone she barely knows (and to whom she is not married), blacks and whites cheerfully intermingle everywhere--this contemporization of a much earlier era was distracting. Also, I never understood why Allie falls for Noah in the first place. Noah is an immature doof--endangering himself and others on the ferris wheel, talking to Allie later on like a would-be stalker, and then, when they do go out, lying in the middle of the street. And when Allie tells Noah she doesn't want to lie in the middle of the intersection, Noah pulls the manipulative old, ""Your problem is you just don't let your self have any fun."" Maybe her problem, Noah, is that she has common sense and you don't? According to the young lovers, all they do is fight. And they have nothing in common. But hey, as the movie shows us, they're physically attracted to each other. And that is enough to produce a great and enduring love. Now there's a wonderful message to send the teenage girls who must be watching this film.And finally, the movie shows Allie's fiancé, Lon, as a wonderful guy. Mature, hard-working, with a string of virtues already mentioned by another IMDb poster. And Allie is in love with him. I cannot fathom why she would be more attracted to Noah, with whom she argues and has nothing in common (except sexual attraction, evidently).I did think James Garner did a decent job with the script he was given. But it was all too little too late.",The Notebook

222,what3v3r,Of Halcyon Days and Love-Lorn Emotions ! Brilliant !,10,11 July 2005,"No matter how indifferent and self-absorbed you are , you will be moved ! Truly Sensational ! If you have been wanting to break down and cry and let it all out for a long time , this movie is tailor made for you. The movie at some point of time, will most certainly let you relate to events within your life. A simple love story, superbly portrayed with an impeccable soundtrack in the backdrop of some breathtaking sceneries will suck you towards itself in an almost maudlin experience. Sometimes you could just feel all that love populating the story. Personally, the unforgettable experience that this movie is probably wont fade itself to oblivion for quite some years to come. If you wanna rent a DVD for Valentines, look no further. Ryan Gosling plays Noah , the young love-struck go-getter while Rachel McAdams plays his love interest, young Ali. The pleasant soundtrack and the wonderful cinematography leaves you in one of those halcyon days of peace and tranquility. You will go totally immersed in the movie as the two go crazy in love with each other , not able to keep their hands of one another. Just when you expect the typical love story to unfold, it hits you with a wonderful twist leaving you guessing all over again. One wonderful aspect of this movie was the absence of the usual stereotypical clichés of movies in this genre. Gosling brings an almost incredible innocence to the role of Noah. Even with the beard, the innocence doesn't hide itself. Rachel on the other hand brings a lil bit of ""Mean Girls"" into this movie, only for the good of it, which helps in keeping with her character in the movie. Joan Allen also puts in a pretty decent performance while she contributes to the movies emotional allure.The final sequence of events although believed to be the climax of the movie, isn't quite. The movie all over is the climax. From the moment it immerses you into itself it is a climax. I could re-run the entire movie in my mind after having watched it once. 10 on 10 ....my first 10 for this genre !",The Notebook

Yes, even tho people are denying existence of cold-heart, it does exist, indeed. However, this movie, at least for a one moment, returns the faith of the kindness to me, and I am thankful. The Notebook sets story of two young in love, fighting against those who do not believe in the bond between the poor and the rich; 'He's a good boy, but he's not for you.'Based on the book by Nicholas, they actually adopted movie at their best. Movie does what no other romantic movie of now-days does : It returns faith to our hearts; faith of the kindness that truly exist in each and every human being, even tho that kindness is lost deep because of the coldness and cruelness of the world. It could be said that this movie has a elements of fantasy, classic fairytale; yet it's not. It is possible for the love to win everything if it's real - it is truly the greatest weapon among all.I've said a lot, but nothing about the movie itself. Well, movie is, if not the best, in top 3 romantic movies ever made. Plot, acting, dialog, chemistry ... It stars with beautiful view upon the sunset and the lake; it truly starts magnificently. 'Do you want to dance with me ?' - so honest and respectful, so innocent and naive, yet so honorable. I could've never think of myself that kind a approach to the girl I'd sometimes like. Movie really brings an truthful picture of love, kindness, struggles, rewards, hate, naivety and honesty, and the rating does not do the justice to this movie.

The acting was tremendous - James Garner should get an Oscar for his performance. The idea of a patient in a nursing home reading a story to another was brilliant. Jame Garner role as the narrator made the movie. He made the love story between Noah & Allie even more believable. His performance during the scene when the doctor was sedating Gena is nothing short of heart pulling. It took every once of energy from me. Even my 15 year old daughter was misty eyed.

The plot is very nice and a classic plot in my opinion, the actors did a very good job of portraying their characters (especially Ryan Gosling playing Noah Calhon), and the writers wrote a very good script.Anyone who is a fan of romantic movies has to see this movie and I will guarantee that if you like romance movies, you will love this film.",The Notebook

There is not a person that hasn't felt drawn back toward a first love, nor is there a person who doesn't wish for and look for a love that will last a lifetime - someone to be passionate with, to laugh with, to argue with, to be with when things are difficult and to grow old with.This movie is a tribute to a love that surpasses all other loves.

230,jormatuominen,Romeo and Juliet get a second chance,8,1 December 2015,"First of all, this film is not a guide to romantic love, just as Saving Private Ryan was not a guide as to how to conduct a World War. Both films are originally based on a true story, but the charm of these stories is their exceptional nature. I guess we need miracles. Eternal first love is not just bliss in this film. Director Nick Cassavetes and his Romeo and Juliet, Canadian actors Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams do depict the pain, heartbreak and misery that the stubborn lover cause each other and to others around them. The film really gets going when the former teen lovers of 1940 return from World War II, now adults. America has changed morally, their relationship is no longer quite as unimaginable and unrealistic as it used to be. For the viewer, the tension really builds up - something is bound to happen, and You will find yourself on the edge of your seat, biting your nails. The films is really well dramatized from the novel, the casting is perfect and Nick Cassavetes shows himself to be a masterful director. As a curiosity, she does direct her own mother Gena Rowlands here as well. The Notebook works on many levels. Even an old guy like me had to shed some tears here. However, the teen affair part of the film was a bit long and there were too many I love yous to merit more than 8 out of 10. Gosling and McAdams are great physical actors and pledge their love in electrifying fashion, there just was too much of a good thing here. This is an experience that will haunt you for some time.",The Notebook

During the opening credits the rower on the lake in the twilight to the fantastic piano main title by Aaron Zigman while the camera slowly pans in on Gena Rowlands, standing in a window of a mansion watching the birds approach, brings tears to my eyes.Unfortunately, in my opinion, the ""young"" leads come across as being rather bland and uninteresting whereas Rowlands and Garner as the mature couple are magnificent and more than make up for any weak moments. Joan Allen in a co-starring role as Allie's mother is great as well, especially as she ""becomes human"" and reveals a deep secret about her own youth towards the end of the movie.Well worth watching for the beautiful story line and the fantastic performances of Rowlands, always a treat, and Garner.

But after dodging my wife's request to watch with her after she rented it a week ago, I finally yielded so I can move on with my life and ended up being somewhat impressed.""The Notebook"" is really a two-sided story regarding an elderly man (James Garner) in home that reads a love story to another elderly woman on a daily basis. The love story itself is about two love birds in the beginning of adulthood and troubled by various obstacles in life like her overbearing parents and his lack of ""successfull"" lifestyle. Noah (James Gossling) plays a free-spirited, blue collared lumber yard worker that is smitten by Allie, (nicely played by Rachel McAdams) a rich, southern belle with strict parents looking to break out of her mold. Yes, it's somewhat a ""Dirty Dancing"", bad boy/good girl tug-of-war relationship, but the movie delves deep into their lives and you soon forget the typical clichéd baseline.The acting is pretty good, and quite exceptional for Rachel McAdams whose has played career draining, teen queen roles in the likes of ""Mean Girls"" and another Rob Schnieder flop ""Hot Chick."" Seriously, she must have one of the best agents in the business to pull for a deep role that required acting, and pulled it off. Gossling does a somewhat notable job as the nomad lover and of course James Garner is James Garner. The story of Gossling and McAdams, coupled with the relationship between Garner and the other elderly woman is what really puts this movie together. The ending is pretty predictable along with most of the plot, but in the end it all pays off.If you're not a romance fan and totally dismiss movies like this I don't blame you. But, at least give it a chance when you're totally burnt out of other movies or if your significant other is jonesing for a chick flick, pick this one up.",The Notebook

I have watched this movie so many times, and I believe I will watch it more and more. Because this movie is based on real-life situations, I value it more than other romantic movies. This movie shows how from a tiny spark, two people can fall into such a great and everlasting love, that even after some tragedies that love would last between them. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who does not believe that true love exists!",The Notebook
234,retroguy02,An unabashedly romantic and unadulterated love story that gets it right,8,19 August 2011,"Classic love stories that lack grit or are ""grounded in reality"" are rather rare to come by in mainstream Hollywood in the 21st century. The Notebook is a throwback to the days when ""serious"" love stories were passionate, optimistic affairs devoid of any realist pretences, and this sincerity is by far the movie's biggest draw.The plot is narrated in flashback by an elderly man at a senior home to an amnesiac lady friend (who happens to be his childhood sweetheart), and the story isn't terribly original – wealthy teenage girl falls in love with a modest but charming local boy during a summer vacation in rural South Carolina, her parents force her to move away, the boy and the girl carry on with their lives until they cross paths years later as adults and rekindle an old flame. The straightforward plot works because this is a movie that knows exactly what it is – a classy sweep-you-off- your-feet romance about two people, and a very solid one at that.The lead actors are attractive and look the part, while the cast in general fills out its shoes adequately – there isn't any standout that leaves a long-lasting impression, but the same could be said for the characters they're given to work with. The much-needed chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams is there (heck, they hit off a real-life romance once they met on the set, I can only imagine what it must have been like) and their passionate make-out scenes probably justify watching this movie for most folks.The movie sometimes does feel a bit out of touch with the era it's supposed to be set in if you think about it – after all, I'd expect more than a few disapproving looks if someone publicly made out with his girlfriend before marriage in front of his family and friends back in the 1940s – but it's only a minor gripe. This is also a very beautifully shot film, evoking all the right nostalgia of the classic Hollywood era – making out in the rain, canoeing in a scenic river with swans all around, drives around the lush countryside and, of course, losing virginity in a dilapidated farmhouse (that last example might be a bit tongue-in-cheek). The rich, striking cinematography of the outdoors is also thoroughly soothing and contributes wonderfully to the lovestruck, tipsy mood of the film.The Notebook is an honest-to-goodness romantic drama that won't disappoint if you're in the mood for watching an all-out love story. And do watch all the way through – the last scene is quite a tearjerker.",The Notebook
235,clarinets,Beautiful love story,9,1 July 2004,"At first I was slightly hesitant to see this film because I had seen ""Message in a Bottle"" (also based on a Nicholas Sparks novel), and I thoroughly disliked it.However, I was in the mood for something romantic and decided to see it.  I was instantly absorbed in the story.The story begins with an elderly woman being visited by a man who starts reading to her.  The story is about two lovers, Noah and Allie, who meet during the summer and fall in love.  When they are separated, Noah writes to Allie every day, but the letters are intercepted by Allie's mother, who disapproves of Noah because of social status.  Noah gives up after a year and tries to move on with his life.  Later on, however, circumstances cause them to meet again and re-kindle their romance.This movie is a very good story about the staying power of true love, despite the obstacles which may try to tear it apart.  Noah and Allie work very hard to make their relationship work, and make choices to be true to their love, despite what others speculate about it.The ending is truly beautiful, if a bit unreal, but the whole romance is very watchable.  There was not a dry eye in the theatre when the movie was over.",The Notebook
236,gordonm888,"Some flaws but best film ever at depicting ""love until death do us part""",8,18 December 2011,"Let me confess: I am a guy, a husband of 23 years, reviewing a chick flick. And I've watched this film twice and read a large fraction of the viewer's comments, trying to think about and reconcile the two polar-opposite views of this film that viewers seem to have. So here is what I think.1. The Notebook is the most touching and most accessible film ever made at depicting a romantic love that endures even through the gruesome trials of extreme old age -until ""death do us part."" If you don't get it, or don't think this is the way relationships are then I suspect it is because this is not the way relationships have been for you personally so far. But this type of love does truly exist -just as heroism truly exists. There are thousands of movies about heroism,even though many of us never experience ""action heroes"" in real life. There are very few movies about an ""unselfish love"" and how it persists beyond the courting and newlywed phases of life.And,as a depiction of an enduring unselfish love, The Notebook is a very successful and powerful movie. In fact I cannot think of any popular film that is as good as the Notebook in this regard. It has moments of brilliant film-making -such as the beautiful turning-point scene on the river, and the way that Allie (Rachel McAdams) laughs after the lying-in-the-road scene when she admits ""that was fun!"", and the moment when James Garner says ""As long as my wife is here, this is my home."" But lets not argue individual scenes because here is the bottom-line: As my wife and watched the last 20 minutes, I had to hold my wife in both arms as she cried loudly and her body shook. Eventually, at the ending scene, I started crying myself. I'm sorry, no matter how clunky one or two scenes may be, any movie that can elicit that strong of a reaction from some of its audience is a very well done movie. 2. Yep, I agree with the criticism of some of the scenes and acting: I thought the scenes with the Ferris Wheel and Noah and Ally lying on the road showed Noah as having an unattractive recklessness. Also, I wish Ryan Gosling had shown a bit more range, more of the softer, sensitive side of a man in scenes in which Noah and Allie were together. Gosling's acting depicts young love only as an overwhelming urgency to be together, but otherwise depicts little tenderness and is weak on ""chemistry."" Many viewers said that they did not like the constant arguing between Allie and Noah, and I agree that some of the arguing seemed a bit...theatrical. But here's another truth: people in love do argue. Showing the arguments goes against the grain of most romantic films but I think it helps to make the Noah-Allie relationship more realistic - because it is not a phony ""immaculate relationship."" And, there are many spot-on scenes that compensate -such as when Allie's mom takes her daughter to view the man she almost married earlier in life. The scenes with James Garner are almost all superb. The several scenes with the ""widow from the next town"" also rang true. And, the various looks on Rachel McAdams' face as she breaks the news to Lon near the end of the film were realistic and convincing. So, altogether, this is not a flawless film - not a Godfather or Schindler's List - but it is enormously successful at doing what it intended to do and enormously satisfying. And if you, as a viewer, ""just don't get it"" may I suggest that you wait 30 years or until you have a bit more living under your belt - and then, please, view it again. If you do that, I suspect that you will cry -and that if you listen closely, you will hear the crying of the million and one viewers that came before you. I know, I hear a million now.",The Notebook
237,FilmLover-4,Great movie,9,1 July 2004,"This film is a strong romance and love story.Superb filmmaking, and the acting, especially Rachel McAdams, who was captivating, is of a high caliber.It would have been nice if the mild nudity had been left out, and if the intense love-making scenes were more left to the imagination, though I admit that the scenes showed the intensity of their attraction.Everyone has a story to tell, and this was a great story of a lifelong romance started the summer after high school.*** Not for anyone under 16 or maybe even 18.Parents should be wary of having children see this film, especially without talking about it afterwards.  While the love story was powerful and it turned out well for the main characters, intense teen love can also lead to tragic mistakes that impact a lifetime.  There is a certain lack of morality in the main characters (though they may have never been taught the morality), especially considering the time period of the story.I return to the delight in the movie -- Rachel McAdams performance.

238,summerloud,"Charming, if a little generic and naive romance flick",5,4 July 2017,"The notebook is a charming romance movie that easily transports you back into the 40ies to tell its pretty implausible story of a woman torn between two men.That being said, I do not understand Ryan Gosling's acting at all, especially not in a romance flick.Like in the movie Drive, his character keeps the same constant look of detached, dreamy, slightly silly, perpetual slight amusement on his face all the time - whether he meets the love of his life, or his best friend dies - it doesn't seem to make any difference to him.I simply don't understand whats the point of that. In a romance movie, the actors should try their best to convey believable emotions, not try to hide them at all cost? While in Drive, this sort of acting made some sort of sense within the generally weird framework of that movie, it just seems completely out of place in a romance movie, and is especially noticeable here because of its contrast to the lively, hearty performance of Heather Wahlquist as Sara.In the end, this did not really completely ruin the movie for me, but I still found it distracting and detrimental to the overall charm of an otherwise above-average romance movie.Still, the high rating on IMDb would have irritated me either way, but I guess the tear-jerking end served to push that up.5/10",The Notebook

I was quite pleasantly surprised, and must admit that the end of the movie left me in tears.I've read other reviews and have seen the words sappy, sentimental, manipulative, and shallow, and that some of the situations are hopelessly unrealistic. And yes, all that is true, but done in such a beautiful and sincere way that it didn't bother me that much.

But as I watched the film, I realized there was more to the story. I don't want to get into it too much, but needless to say, I was very happy by the end. Also, it has to be noted that Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams have tremendous chemistry on screen. Also, Gena Rowlands and James Garner give moving performances in their respective roles. Although I found one of the plot twists quite easy to identify, it was developed in a very interesting way, which didn't ruin it for the viewer.

After risking his life to ask her out (by hanging off a ride), the two fall madly in love. But disapproving parents, love rivals and a world war, all help make their love live as much a roller coaster as the amusement park they met in. Playing the loved up couple are Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, who help bring to the story the passion and worry that seems to fill the script. However some scenes feel so sickly sweet that diabetics should think twice, as director Nick Cassavetes goes for broke while trying to convince us of their love. Anchoring the film to the present day is James Garner and Gena Rowlands, as an old couple reading the story that unfolds. Garner is more Rocking Chair that Rockford File, and his scenes with Rowlands leads to a climax that even the most unobservant viewer would have guessed on page 1.

I'm a little tired of the rich parents forbidding these romances in movies like this, but beyond that the story is quite good.

Right at the beginning it reminds you of all of the dozen movies that have been written that just added to the overall cheesiness that they make you sit through, trying to make it seem as if they are really telling you something new. The acting wasn't bad, it was better than most in this genre of film and once again you see James Marsden as the other guy that's only there as a matter of convenience. Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling held their own, but the real problem that I have with this is just that it is so gosh darn irritatingly sappy. So to conclude this review, I wouldn't really recommend this film, sure it's good if you are a prepubescent girl who still has some silly ideal about how love is supposed to be (and mind you films like this only reinforce the rarity of ""true love"") the sad fact is in the real world things just don't work out that way.5/10",The Notebook

I am getting a bit tired of this rich girl loves poor boy storyline, but this one worked out nicely. As everyone says it is about a sugary sweet romance turned sour. I really bought their love. The performances and writing were just as great, I kept forgetting I was watching a movie. Just the most adorable way to fall in love (a way many women can only dream about).The one thing I really just did not like about this movie was when it would cut to old Ally and Noah in the nursing room. I mean, yes, this story is about forever love, but is it really necessary to constantly go back to them. he main story is about when they were young and in love. I think that a simple 5-10 minute beginning of them and a 5-10 minute ending of them would have been much better.What I'm trying to say is that rather or not you enjoy sugary love stories, you should at least give this one a try.",The Notebook

This movie is a roller coaster of emotions, contains some comedy, but the majority is having you extremely sad, near tears, then extremely happy, near tears again.
So do i recommend this movie? Yes of course, it is one of those movies that everyone, well everyone who is into the genre of the film, should go and watch. Not something you want to miss out. Cant say anything bad about this movie. I give it a very high rating. Worth every penny.",The Notebook
248,selenedm999,unabashed sentiment--contains possible spoilers,8,4 February 2007,"I waited a long time to see this movie, because I'm not much for sentiment, in fact I can pretty much do without it. If I were to list my favourite movies for you, you wouldn't find a ""real"" romance in the bunch (Pulp Fiction, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Taxi Driver, etc.). However, what draws most movie buffs, and I'm no exception, is a deep love of narrative, interesting characters, and masterful writing. The Notebook delivers all of these, and much more.The Notebook is the simple story of two lovers (Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdam) who meet in the late 1930s (the actual year isn't given), then break up, and meet again seven years later. It's offset by the narrative structure of a man reading to a woman with senile dementia (played by James Garner and Gena Rowlands). Although the star-crossed lovers are sympathetic because they're young and beautiful, I found it was the older couple who really drove the story. Even now, with so many big-name actors reaching their ""Golden Years,"" it's still rare to see actors who look their age, acting age-appropriate parts. While second to the younger couple, Garner and Rowlands turn in two of the loveliest performances I've seen in years--tender and compelling, and over-the-top sentimental, yet still sadly, wonderfully human.Be sure to keep a big box of tissues handy for this one, but it's well worth it.",The Notebook
249,knows_film,Movies like this make me sick,1,13 March 2006,"This is one of those exploitation pieces geared at your heart strings. For the entire film this movie's plot tugs at the viewers heartstrings. It'd be moving if it wasn't so obvious! Without being too negative, I'll say that Rachel McAdams is a stand out! And the fact that she didn't get nominated for an Oscar let alone win is a complete tell. That for me completely rings home the tune that art is subjective and how can you compare it. Not that you cant criticize it. Which I'm about to do.The Notebook is crap.A film about a notebook was always going to be a gamble. And I must say it didn't pay off. But how could it? A two hour film about a notebook? Seriously what next. A 3 hour film about a phone book? But can I just reiterate that Rachel McAdams is the most attractive looking thing I've seen on film since Katharine Ross in The Graduate. But seriously tho, the make up people need to paint some eye brows on her. What a weird looking thing, reminds me of some kind of DNA gene botch up albino monster!",The Notebook

In comparison to the novel, this film was such a disappointment. In my opinion, a travesty.My wife and I agreed (and that is a fairly rare event in our appraisal of films!) that the casting of all the leading roles, without exception (except Noah's father, who didn't even figure in the novel!), was inappropriate and unsympathetic, and that the special qualities that made this short and economically written book so touching and memorable were lost in the film version. Even the house shown in the film was not all evocative of the one Noah had restored. Above all the descriptions and mood created around Noah on the river at sunrise, and the magical trip leading to the 'bird lake', such powerful images in the book, and of his poetry, were played down to a minimal level.It was as if the task of adaptation to screen was handed to someone who kept only the title and bare outline of the story and then proceeded to create a different, and vastly inferior and less powerful work.What a shame The Notebook has not enjoyed a truly sympathetic or sensitive adaptation like The Bridges of Madison County, Enchanted April or even the recent Ladies in Lavender. The power of the novel deserved this. Perhaps a European director (or Clint Eastwood) would have done it more justice.A missed opportunity.",The Notebook
253,17268,More movies like this could cure what ails the box office.,10,17 December 2005,"If Hollywood would make and effectively market more movies like ""The Notebook,"" they could end the box office slump and draw a much wider audience back to the movies.The movie should appeal to ADULTS who like good writing, acting, direction, and production values. I doubt that the budget for ""The Notebook"" was very large, but every penny that was spent shows on the screen--and this is a period (largely 1940's) picture. Having just seen the incredibly overrated ""The Aviator"" which had all kinds of errors in continuity--for example, the scandal magazines like ""Confidential"" weren't published until a decade later than the screenplay claims--I appreciated the accuracy of sets, costumes, etc., in ""The Notebook.""The pace of the movie is leisurely but not plodding. I suspect that a lot of viewers won't be terribly surprised at the twist that comes about three-quarters through the movie, but the film is so well-acted, written, and directed that no one will feel cheated.Special mention must be made about James Garner and Gena Rowlands, the mother of director Nick Cassvetes. Rowlands has long been a brilliant actress, and she just keeps getting better. Thanks in part to TV movies as well as theatrical releases, she continues to enjoy a productive career. With any luck, maybe she will get that standout role that will bring her a long-deserved Oscar.As for Garner, he has been underrated and unappreciated for decades. At least as far back as ""The Americanization of Emily"" and his TV series ""The Rockford Files,"" Garner has been turning out quality work, much like a much handsomer Spencer Tracy. He and Rowlands bring out the best in each other--their scenes together are heartbreaking.The rest of the cast in excellent. In particular, Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams deserve to have long careers; and Joan Allen again shows why she should have more work.Finally, anyone who has had a parent, relative, or friend in a nursing home will find ""The Notebook"" packs an extra wallop.",The Notebook

I got lucky to get a sneak-peek of this one. The film is just stunning. At some times, touching and deeply moving, other times fun and sensual,""The Notebook"" has something that made Hollywood great Romances classics during the 30's and the 40's: strong leads and a fine chemistry between them.McAdams and Gosling are superb. Their performances are so true, living and real that you actually believe they did have a crush on each other at the set! Keep watching for these guys, they are going to be huge stars.The screenplay is great: fancy, well-constructed, solid, it captures the spirit of the book. Unfortunately, Cassavettes' clumsy and choppy directing skills keep the film from reaching Greatness Heights. You can feel the guy is on a rush. Geez, the film could have been 15 minutes longer!Still, a very fine film. McAdams' and Gosling's master work makes the ride worth it.8/10.",The Notebook

Also, the film shows the depressing state of a nursing home, even one as perfect as in the film. The opening scene that shows patients lining up for their morning meds made me especially angry - people treated like prisoners, their only ""crime"" - growing old.

They fall in love but of course they cannot be together right away. It takes years before they will actually be together. Well only a stone-hearted person will not be moved by this great little movie. There's no action, there's no special effects.

This movie makes up for our regrets in love to some extent, telling us this truth: When we work hard to love each other and fulfill our promises, why can't we be together?

262,trix_n_min,Achingly Touching,10,13 May 2008,"The Notebook would have to be the most beautiful, touching romance film to be released in modern times. I was a skeptic at first, feeling it could not possibly be that good, but it is. It is unusual for a movie released after 1980 to make it in to my top ten films of all time, but this film has slotted right on in to the top of my list. What is so special about this film? Everything. The casting is perfect, I couldn't imagine any other girl being able to play Allie and do a performance as realistic and adorable as Rachel McAdams. Most women in romance films are extremely irritating and annoying, yet even in her indecisiveness in the film Allie is still totally lovable, and you can understand Noah's infatuation with her. Noah, likewise, is perfectly cast, not the typical smooth, suave lead male - he also is realistic and highly appealing. The older actors playing Noah and Allie are also sensational, they make the film so much more special with their achingly beautiful scenes. The romance in this film is perfectly crafted, not overdone, just exactly right. It is powerful and passionate, and something everyone can relate to in regards to your first love. There is a scene where Allie's boyfriend proposes to her, and she accepts, and the voice-over says that in the moment Allie said yes, ""Noah's face came into her mind."" It just is such a sad, nostalgic moment that I cry every time at this line. The film is also humorous in parts, and the conflicts are perfectly acted. I really think it is having the couple as elderly people looking back on the past that really makes the film that much more special than other romances. The only teeny tiny problem I had with this film was in the way Noah and Allie first meet. The ""love-at-first-sight"" that Noah shows, to me, is silly and pretty unrealistic as he hasn't even spoken to her. But when they get together, everything is beautiful and really easy to relate to. The notion of time in this film also sets it apart - years pass, and it just makes their reunion that much sweeter. And the final scene? Devastatingly beautiful, could not be any sweeter or more touching. I also love the use of I'll Be Seeing You, the song played a few times in the movie. It is so appropriate and so, so touching. Absolutely gorgeous movie, one of the best I've ever seen and extremely hard to contend with. If you haven't seen it, do it. It is not just a girly romance - men also love this film. Definite 10 out of 10. Perfect.",The Notebook
263,smit815,My Nomination for Academy Award,10,17 July 2004,"This may be the best movie I  have seen in 30 years. The things I liked about it1. Gena Rowlands and James Garner were masterful. They exuded true chemistry, and they were able to bring out the emotion of the story without being maudling and without being manipulative. I believe that they are shoo-ins for nominations for academy awards. He modeled tenderness and love in a way that I hope husbands of aging wives will learn from.2. I liked the fact that Lon was not one dimensional. He loved Allie enough to let her go.3. I liked the way that Allie's mother was able to show her that she understood the difficult choice Allie had to make between Noah and Lon. She admitted her mistake about not being honest with Allie when she presented the letters.Questions left unanswered:1. Did Noah work in the lumber mill for the rest of his life? I doubt he could have provided like he did in such a job. Would liked to have known his occupation.2. What happened to Noah's mother?One thing I did not like.1. I appreciated that there was no nudity (no, I am not an old fogey). But can we not understand that characters in movies are having sexual encounters with having to feel like voyeurs. When Rhett grabbed Scarlet and carried her up the stairs we knew what was going on without full graphics.

Unconditional love, sacrifice, freedom, pain, tears, happiness, passion and moving moments, all of that is shaped in 123 minutes and at the end you wish there was more. Ofc, don't judge me to fast, I believe in love, but this kind of story is pretty unrealistic and in my head is more like some science-fiction movie created specially for some romantic souls. This fact don't reduce art factor of this creation, but in contrary tells how powerful can be and effect on you, if you ever shared such emotions with someone or maybe, didn't, but wanted to express them.All that I say above is just invitation to enjoy in one really beautiful movie that will not change your world, but for sure will touch you deeply.

266,lucky_star_1,"'The Notebook' is, quite simply, a truly beautiful love story. More convincing than 'Titanic's' romance",8,8 June 2007,"Three quarters of the movie shows the relationship between young lovers Noah and Allie, played truthfully by Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, who generate sizzling chemistry and share a romance ten times more beautiful, believable and fulfilling than Jack and Rose in 'Titanic'. When drawing comparisons, you always sensed that the tragedy of the ship sinking would tear Jack and Rose apart forever, whereas in this movie, every moment Noah and Allie are not together, you long for them to be and know deep down they will be again. Also unlike Titanic, The Notebook focuses solely on their unconditional and passionate love and isn't overshadowing any other story going on in it. This makes you root for the lovers to be together even more.Even though you hate to admit it, you end up not completely hating the two main obstacles in the way of them continuing their relationship. Firstly, there is Allie's mother, Anne, played with a strong sincerity by Joan Allen. At the beginning, her ranting about the 'unsuited' couple makes you assume she genuinely just looks down on Noah because he's not good enough, however by the end of the movie, the audience learns there is more to her objection than she initially shows. Secondly, there is Allie's fiancée Lon, whom she has met 7 years after her break-up with Noah. Now because he is played so sympathetically by handsome actor James Marsden, when Allie is left to make her decision between the two guys, you end up feeling sorry for him because he seems genuinely in love with her despite knowing she spent a weekend with Noah. Nevertheless, you never get the sense of him being her soul-mate, at all. In spite of his love for her, he just always strikes you as the guy who the girl's parents approve of and is very wealthy. Whereas in the first half of the movie, you're desperate for her to stay with Noah because they learn a lot from each other, can be free when together and she continues to love him despite parental objections. Moreover, considering Allie's unfaithfulness when she visits Noah, she's lucky that Lon expresses any sort of loving feeling for her at all after he finds out.James Marsden didn't get a lot of screen time but still made a decent subtle impact when he had the chance, although like I pointed out before, Lon's love for Allie doesn't compare to Noah's and Noah does so many things throughout the movie to prove the depth of his feelings. Sam Shepard brings some comic relief into the role of Noah's father and David Thornton has a very limited role as Allie's father but still impresses and doesn't play the character with straightforward hatred towards Noah. A special mention goes to Gena Rowlands (the director's mother) and James Garner who star as the older Allie and Noah, and generally act in the scenes where you need to reach for the tissues the most. My only concern is that neither one, James in particular, struck me as an older version of Rachel and Ryan! But their heartbreaking portrayals overshadowed this problem.And last of all, the best thing about this movie is the undeniable chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. I mean seriously, they weren't even dating until the year after they made the movie, but their moments together felt so natural that I actually believed it was the actors falling in love, not just the characters. Ryan does a complete turnaround from his sinister brilliance in 'Murder by Numbers' and is flawless playing the devoted guy who wins the girl's heart. You would seriously think he'd played romantic leads beforehand, he is such a gentleman in this movie and very sexy, so it's not hard to believe that a lot of girls along with Allie fell in love with him watching him in this movie. Rachel brings a stunning beauty to the screen and like Ryan, pulls off changing from a sweet lovelorn teenager to an older, more serious person. Memorable scenes are the ones showing Noah and Allie dating through the summer and they can't keep away from each other, and of course the scene in the rain set seven years later.To sum up, there is amazing acting from everyone, stunning cinematography, a heartbreaking developing story and two very gorgeous leads playing an unforgettable movie couple - perhaps the best couple ever screened. I was impressed, and hopefully you will be too! A can't stop watching the DVD it is that amazing!",The Notebook

I've read complaints in other reviews that the movie is too perfect, too idealized, too sugary - too beautiful! - and that maybe the director should shake his head and get back to reality. I agree on one point; that the ending is tied-up as perfectly as a little bow.But to all you detractors out there, I say so what.  So what? Something in our hearts always longs for the best, the happiest, the most wonderful. And that place is always out there, seemingly unreachable, as far away as the moon over the water on a cloudless night.  But then too, on quiet nights, some of us have peered up at that moon, and been swept by its embrace.

Not only that, but when Allie was engaged she actually went and had sex with Noah. That, to me, would seem like it would make her fiancé angry, but he didn't even care. The ending was disappointing, especially in comparison to the novel's, even though I didn't enjoy the novel either. It's one of the most overrated romances I have ever seen.

We don't know whether Alie chooses Noah or her lover until the final scene, and the development of the story is more interesting than normal love stories.

On the one hand it had good reviews (on the whole) and responses from people who had seen it. On the other hand it had been castigated by others as shallow and manipulative.Having seen the film, I think I can understand the contrasting responses.On the one hand I would have to agree that the movie is fairly shallow and manipulative, but it is done with such panache that it carries you along.The film is framed by an old man reading to a woman with alzheimers the story of a young man from the lumber works and a young woman from a rich family falling in love, being separated and then meeting again years later when she is engaged to marry another. The relationship of the two older characters is explored as the story from the notebook progresses.With the ""notebook"" story, the film-makers and actors make it easy to understand why Ally fell in love with Noah. They are not as successful in capturing the contrary aspect (other than her beauty, which was not sufficient to explain the degree of obsession shown).What is well established is the dilemma she faces when she discovers that Noah still loves her but she also loves her fiancé.This is a movie that I recommend seeing with someone you love - but probably only once, because further watching may bring some of the flaws into clearer view.",The Notebook

The story teller, Duke (James Garner) reading from ""The Notebook"" to Mrs. Calhoun in the retirement home, played by Director Nick Cassavetes' mother, Gena Rowlands who has memory problems.As complicated as it sounds watching it is easy. The cuts from the past to present are well done. We all understand at different points in the movie that Mrs. Calhoun is married to Duke but does not remember him, especially in the scene when their children come to visit and their mother does not know who they are leaving them hurt and wishing for their father to return home because he is missed; how will she know he is not there or feel abandoned if she doesn't even know who he is? We get to see how they fell in love, how they almost lost each other and how their love would never die; and Duke (aka Noah) believes this with all his heart. In the final scenes we learn that the ""Notebook"" of their love story is written by Allie herself. She wrote it upon learning she would start to forget, she wrote it for Noah to read to her so she would remember; and she does. Every once and a while Allie comes back, remembers all, and she and Noah are in love again, but it is only temporary, sometimes only a few minutes, and she not only forgets but becomes frighten of Noah, breaking his heart, literally. Noah has had a few heart attacks. The scene when she remembers and then forgets is heart breaking.

All i can say is that, if you're a love movie person, it's the movie for you. And if you're not, it's still the movie for you, to make you realise not all love movies are the same.",The Notebook
277,bpolhemus,"My ""Review"" Will Go Completely Against The Grain",2,16 February 2005,"This is a formulaic ""chick flick"" with the interesting twist that it doesn't focus SOLELY on the ""passion"" of young love but does show that love can endure. I appreciate that as far as it goes.However, as the father of a teenage girl (now 15) trying to rear her with values in this valueless world of ""sex, lies and DVD,"" I must protest.Above all, young women (at least) AND young men with any integrity whatsoever did NOT behave this way in the 1930s and 40s. Such unbridled passion leading immediately to sexual gratification occurred seldom. Usually it was the young woman who, by virtue of cultivated modesty and a sense of personal worth, refused to put herself in such a predicament.Certainly ""stuff happens,"" but this was NOT a typical story. The idea that a young woman, regardless of her depth of emotion, would immediately throw herself into bed with her Summer romance--not to mention one she had not seen for years--is just not reality.Could it happen? Yes. Would it have happened? HIGHLY unlikely. In those days, a woman had far, far too much to lose in such a scandal.This was a matter of taking modern sensibility--where ""love"" equals ""sexual passion""--and projecting it into the past, ignoring all the mores and sensibilities of that era. I repeat: It Is Just Not Realistic that a ""mature romance"" would result from such a shameful act.So, it's only a movie, right? Well, my daughter viewed this with her older, married sister, and was so taken with the story. This is the way that young girls are gulled into believing this dark lie: That ""love means giving yourself to 'him' when the opportunity presents itself.""Meanwhile we have our present-day dilemma, of illicit sexual relations between children with no thought of consequence, risking unwanted pregnancy, abortion, emotional trauma and low self-worth, all because these things are depicted as ""part of romance"". It is NOT reality, and it is reckless.This illustrates all too clearly the widening gulf between ""Real America"" and Hollywood--and why Hollywood has done so much over the last generation to help destroy traditional values and land us in the mess we're in today.In 1999, 79% of all births to women aged 15 to 19 were to unmarried women, compared with about 14% in the 1940s and 1950s (SOURCE: Nonmarital Childbearing in the United States, 1940-1999. National Vital Statistics Reports, 2000). Think of that: Even with contraception AND ABORTION available today, the RATE of unmarried teenage pregnancy coming to full term is more than FIVE TIMES what it was in the time period depicted in this movie.What do you think that irresponsible film-making of this kind has contributed to that problem?If you are the parent of a teenager: What messages are you sending to your sons and daughters by your support of films such as these?",The Notebook
278,zoheb-haider,A movie worth experiencing for every person who believes he/she know what live is all about!!!,9,28 April 2014,"A classic tale of love between a small time but very honest and straightforward guy who falls in love with a rich maiden. The first thing that stood out about this movie is the casting which was simply brilliant. Ryan Gosling plays the character of a town boy with perfection and his character portrayal made him look more sophisticated than some of the richest folks around him in the movie storyline. A girl who has literally been in an invisible golden cage all her life falls for the charm of what reality and its exuberance is all about, experiences what its like to be free from all worldly affairs. And as if this wasn't enough, the story has been rounded off with the most stomach crunching tales of selfless love with the two souls literally dying in each other's arms. A source of inspiration for many movies. OK, the best scene in this movie the where the two love birds lay down in the middle of a street crossing, depicting the freedom that people often miss to even notice by being busy in their day to day lives, a freedom which only comes by being completely drowned in a crazy eternal feeling called love!",The Notebook
279,jlwalker19-1,Most romantic movie ever seen,10,16 December 2005,"I have a macho friend who wouldn't be caught dead sitting through a chick flick such as ""Message in a Bottle."" However, this friend of mine told me that ""The Notebook"" was a movie he watched without any great expectations, yet when it was over he said it was the best movie he had seen in years.My reaction was a little more typical. I cried more than once, but the most at the end. Lucky I was watching it on cable, so I wouldn't have to cry so much in public. But it wasn't such a bad cry. It was just having been blown away by this movie. I am not sure I can articulate clearly just how good this movie is. Yes, someone can always find flaws in movies if they want to get picky enough. But in the end, did the movie touch your heart? This one did for me in a way none other ever has.This movie sets the standard on what romantic love is all about. Is it extremely difficult, with many arguments, separations, misunderstandings, and problems? Of course it is. And that is played out realistically here. Yet in the end, the good outweighs the bad by a landslide. Spontaneous fun, kisses and hugs, lying in each other's embrace, gazing into each other's eyes, slow dancing to no music, being in a boat or by the water, allowed to be yourself yet being together as one, never giving up, never stopping the flow of unconditional love, overcoming all obstacles. That kind of love is a miracle.If you are reading through reviews of this movie, and have never seen the movie or read the book, just stop reading reviews, and see the movie. Forget the spoilers, the movie is better watched just fresh. Then, if you are not emotionally moved by this movie, you are either brain dead or something is really wrong with you.Not trying to repeat too much of what others have said, but Rachel McAdams is not only cute and ravenously beautiful, but the whole movie is beautiful. Why it did not win the Oscar for best Cinematography is beyond me. But then I don't understand why it didn't result in several Oscar nominations and winners. Starting with Rachel McAdams, who to me made this movie as great as it is. However, that is not to undermine the other three main actors who were so perfectly cast in their roles. This is the love story for the ages. I didn't feel like I was watching actors. It felt like I was there, like I was any one of the four main characters. I was riveted to the screen.I am a fan of old movies. Casablanca and the like. Which is a great romantic movie. However, The Notebook outdoes even that great classic in its portrayal of romantic love. I had become jaded over the years to believe that great movies were in the past. How refreshing to come across a masterpiece, and one made so recently! One last compliment. My hat is off to you, Nick Cassavetes, as no masterpiece of a movie becomes so without a fine director. Now I'll have to go and read the book.",The Notebook
280,lbabe29,"Impressive acting cannot save this horribly cliché, cheesy and predicable film.",5,15 June 2010,"Firstly let me say i'm a lover of romantic films (Titanic is one of my favorites) and when i go into a romantic film i expect cheesy lines and clichés...but i just could not ""get"" this film, i found it laughably cheesy...roll your eyes, ""i cant believe they just said that"" cheesy.The film begins with an old couple and through a story telling session we begin to learn of the romance between rich, beautiful Allie (McAdams) and the poorer, handsome Noah (Gosling).The main problem i had with this pairing was how unlikely the whole thing seemed, Noah meets Allie and without even a sentence uttered between them, in only minutes of meeting... he threatens to kill himself if she does not go out with him, there he is hanging off a fair ground ride, putting himself in danger all for a girl he only met literally 2 minutes ago....REALLY? it just felt too unrealistic for a film obviously trying for a realistic romance.Mcadams and Gosling have strong chemistry, they are very talented actors and i was impressed with both of them..but something about their romance just did not work for me, good acting can only take you so far...i never felt connected to these characters, i never felt involved but i don't for one minute blame this on the actors.Second MAJOR issue: The old couple storyline, not only is it MASSIVELY predicable meaning the so called ""omg"" twist as to who this old couple is becomes just another eye roller...but its horribly cliché, cheesy and badly acted....i often think i might have enjoyed this film had it only focused on the young allie/noah story (at least the acting was top-notch). these old couple scenes are filled with one cringe-worthy line after another.The ending was also another massive fail, it tried to be sweet/romantic but came of as predicable and corny...it almost felt like the ending to one of those made for TV movies.All in all despite very worthy acting from its leads this film was just TOO cheesy for me to takeMy advice: go watch Titanic, it has the same rich girl/poor boy concept thats MUCH more believable, it has an old lady flashback storyline but again thats done so much better...its just an overall more romantic film....and the cheesy lines work.",The Notebook

All in all, a good movie to spend a evening watching, especially if you are in the mood for a good cry!!Ryan Gosling is amazing; for someone who's not conventionally good looking, and sports a beard through the latter half of the movie, he charmed me totallyThe female lead is also good, but less memorableJames Marsden,as the spurned lover, is also good",The Notebook
283,SilensMortea,Unlike anything else,10,11 July 2010,"I've heard so much about this film, and had always planned on seeing it. I was bored one day and decided to put it in.This movie is the one and only movie to ever make me full-out cry. I cannot and will not watch this film with anyone else as I just can't control myself. I know it's coming; I know what and where, but it tugs at my heartstrings so badly there is no way I can resist. Sure, other movies have made me tear up (the other version of The Little Mermaid, where she dies at the end, the end of AI, parts of Legends of the Fall...)but with this one, I found myself fully weeping as if it were happening to me.I'm a sucker for love stories, and people who love each other. I myself have had nothing but bad luck with my love life, and have searched long and hard for ""the one"". Not able to find it, 3 marriages later, I like to watch love movies and wish I could find someone with that kind of love and dedication for me. It becomes a very personal matter, so it hits me pretty hard when cheating or reunions or whatever come up.I found the story of their meeting and separating very realistic and heartbreaking. Everything that happened to them seemed extreme to me, and I wanted to take the characters and just help them out. Get together! Love each other! Don't go away! You know what I mean...The ""twist"", if it was truly meant to be one, wasn't a twist at all to me, but that doesn't change the emotional impact that comes with it. It's such a depressing and sad story, it stayed in my head so long I always want to watch it- but then again I want it to be fresh, because if you lose the feeling you lose the entire essence of the movie itself. So I stay away, and just remember it.If you are a fan of truly deep love stories, love stories to put all other love stories to shame, then definitely pick this one up. Not a good idea to watch in front of others if you're a crier, or ashamed of it.",The Notebook
284,harve_p,"Less Budget, More Captive version of Titanic",10,1 November 2004,"Makes you cry! That's the impression I got after watching this movie. At least 50 from 80 people in the cinema watching this movie cried as soon as the credit title showed up. As the matter in fact, the story is so simple. No surprises in its plot line. The acting is normally good (but they built a strong chemistry). It's Hallmark way of beauty pictures provided to the audience. And I can tell it's a low budget movie. But yet, the film captivates much strongly than the big budget ""Titanic"".It's the heart that would make this film different. This is the kind of film that touches your heart and emotion deeply in a strange way. I can't describe why I give this movie 10 out of 10, but somehow I feel that I must give it. Maybe it's love. Unending, unselfish love that's maintained during 2 hours of this movie. Atmosphere building consistency and simplicity, they are the best logical reasons I could find to express why I think this movie is so damn good.",The Notebook
285,lvscott,Barely misses The Mark,7,5 September 2004,"OK, I normally will not comment about so called ""Chick Flicks"" but I feel this one here had great potentional, even Academy award potentional, but falls short because of 2 factors, The cons;1. Ryan Gosling; a poor choice here to play Noah. First he gives a dull non inspired performance here. His ""Younger Noah"" does not match up with the older one AT ALL!! Simply stated he has no spark and no reason to be seen as "" a special guy"" that could invoke a ""special love"" His performance leaves me wondering; ""why does Allie fall for this guy?""He really does not seem to be in love, well not in ""Great Love""Colin Farrell would have been my choice here to play NoahGosling seems better suited for a love interest on a soap opera, and he is the main reason this film misses the mark to greatness..2. The film felt and flowed like 2 separate films, with the first half of ""The Romance"" making no real sense. There is no character development and we know little to nothing about Noah AS A PERSON; which as per the above is mainly due to Ryan Gosling's boring and dull performance portraying Noah. Where is his passion? He really does seem like a typical red neck future drunk loser and this disconnects from the older Noah.We are supposed to understand why Allie would fall for this guy beyond the simple ""he is from the wrong side of the tracks"" scenario. I understood why Noah could fall for Allie, but not the other way around!!Many people are from ""the wrong side of the tracks"", SO WHAT? WHATS MAKES ANY ONE OF THEM STAND OUT, err CHARACTER, PASSION, UNIQUENESS? Gosling beings none of these to this lead and he almost ruins this film for me.Pros;1. The story of the older man reading to the older Woman who is suffering from Advanced Dementia is touching and original, especially when we find out why. Both Gardner and Rowlands are great here in these roles and this made the film in my opinion watchable and interesting.2. James Gardner, Gena Rowlands, and Rachel McAdams.The first 2 mentioned here are simply very good in their perspective roles. Where I was very surprised was the performance by Rachel McAdams. She really carried her part of the film. I have read where people here say ""she and Gosling really had good chemistry"" well she has good chemistry with James Marsden as well. Its not because of the male leads in my opinion, its because McAdams really shines here, and I had a lowered expectation of her going in to this film; ""Hey, isn't this the girl from The Hot Chick and mean girls playing a serious lead? Common she cant act.. haha I was wrong!!!McAdams is the scene stealer every time and she out acts Gosling about 10 to 1. She gives you the sense of the passion thats supposed to be here Between Noah and Allie when Gosling fails at it, She carries him in this film and Mardsen. although Mardsen does give an acceptable acting job.Her portrayal of the 17 year old Allie is wide eyed, spunky, and right on the mark. Her portrayal of the 24 year old Allie is mature, tamed and right where it should be, again hitting the mark.It seems to me McAdams has a nice future in film and it goes to show you that some actors when giving the chance CAN REALLY ACT,(Nicole Kidman comes to mind finally getting good roles and shining in them) while others given the chance STILL SUCK!! (Gosling, well as a romantic lead err, SUCKS!!)The premise for this film is original, and 3 out of the 4 leads act very well. This film is not as ""Diabetic unfriendly"" as some people would have you believe, but is not sugar free either. What bothers me is we don't have enough character development, again with Gosling's portrayal be first and foremost lacking.If we were able to change that, then this film would be an academy award nominee, A good film in spite of its flaws but not a great film. Remember people, because a film makes you cry don't make the film great. I've seen people cry watching Soap Operas and Hot Dog eating contests as well!! scores as follows;1. a take a date to flick  2. originality= 7 (10 for the premise) 3. acting = 8 (would be 10 but Gosling takes away allot) 4. Kleenex needed? YES BRING A BOX!! (and save it for the very end)finally; Academy award nomination potentional?Supporting actor=Gardner=Maybe excellent acting Supporting actress Rowlands=Maybe= excellent Lead Actress= McAdams;I'd say yes if she had a good leading man(Like Colin Farrell) to have worked with. Simply put, she just really carries Gosling too much, all the chemistry is from her, for this reason, she won't get a nod which is too bad, This lady has the potentional to be a top actress.Movie=NO Director=good job but no. Other awards, possibly (cinematography is excellent, set design and costume)Rasberry ward for worse actor? YES FOR GOSLING!!over all 7 out of 10, Recommended highly for the 3rd date to 5th date scenario, but not a first date scenario!!",The Notebook

Yep, every teenager's dream. Now as I turned older, watching this movie again is just torturing.The story is unrealistic, the characters are completely boring and lack of anything special to remember. It feels like just a bunch of normal people who are thrown into a overly dramatized world. This is like watching a movie that some dude become president of the US when he wakes up one morning - perhaps entertaining at the time when you have very little real life experience.We need to stop making movies like this and make more movies that either have more characteristic people and believable storyline or a movie that is about normal people and their realistic drama in life.",The Notebook

Afterward, we met in the ladies room for comments and further blubbering. Their reaction was that the movie depicted a love that few have experienced and that evoked deep emotions of either celebration or personal regret. Having said that, my reaction was the same as far as that goes. I have one disappointment, which is my usual disappointment where modern-day movies are concerned. Writers and directors take women from other times and places and bestow upon them a crudeness found in the latter part of the 20th century and first part of the 21st. A well brought up young lady from Charleston (she establishes that she is a virgin) would not unbuckle a boys belt and remove his pants, certainly not on a first meeting. She would not kiss him on a public street. She would not leap into his arms in front of other men.She may do that in private, but never in public. I do wish the industry would realize that the present day luedness found in young women is not found historically in the better classes.

289,jeffthemartin,A smart movie inhabited by real people,8,19 May 2005,"""The Notebook"" can easily appear to be a typical Hollywood movie, but it's a smart movie inhabited by real people, and that is why it is worth watching.The story is the typical formula ""boy meets girl, and at first they're happy, but then stuff happens, and there's a big surprise ending."" Even the fact that the story is told, in large part, from the perspective of an old man isn't very original. What makes this a smart movie is that it assumes we know the formula, and it doesn't try to hide from it. It faces the challenge head-on, as if to say, ""we are going to do such a good job of telling this typical Hollywood story that you won't care that it's been told a million times before."" Most strikingly, the film recognizes that even though the story contains A BIG REVELATION, most people are going to figure it out half way through the movie, so there's no point in going to ridiculous lengths to hide it.While the story is typical, the actors and characters are not. Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling, as the romantic leads, play their parts with utter sincerity and believability. The characters are likable, not because they're hilarious, or perfect, but because they are normal goofy people, with their share of likability and good looks, balanced by imperfections. Their relationships to each other and to their families are just like real life--they fight, and they make out, all in the same day. The parents are not just parents--they are real people, with the same range of emotions and personality traits as any other person.For me (a 25-year-old, recently married male) all this added up to me identifying very strongly with the characters in this film, while not being distracted by clichés.",The Notebook

This wasn't your average tale of love though - but I won't spoil your viewing experience.I really enjoyed it and think that others will definitely think others will too. It will make you yearn for a burning love or it will make you think of that one who got away or maybe the love that slipped away. Either way, it will melt the toughest heart in the room.

The main problem is the plot. I'm usually not too good at foreseeing a plot, or at least I try to ignore it, but that was just impossible with this one. It is so obvious what's about to happen, both scene by scene by also the main plot itself.

Death involved. And I feel like that genuinely is the standout moment that made people fall in love with this movie and cry. The build is extremely trope-filled and Goslings characters behaviour would literally be harassment in real life unless he was as attractive as he is. Also extremely childish and immature but I'm guessing the pre-romance movie critique world was happy to ignore that. Their relationship is extremely toxic with the dude constantly negging her (where did you think those pick-up artist got the idea from). I'm going to label this as spoiler but really is it?

293,alombardy,Overly drawn out mushy love story gives us a decent ending (but it's not worth it),5,1 June 2014,"I'm not sure what this movie was trying to do.Let's start with the length; it's far too long at over two hours. For about 100 of those 120 minutes, however, I was thinking of coming on here and absolutely trashing it. It employs every stereotype, every romantic cliché, every predictable situation and outcome, and every setup and resolution you've seen a million times before. And yet the last fifteen minutes is actually a fairly satisfying conclusion. I don't think it's quite strong enough to save the movie - you have to go through far too much of Ryan Gosling infuriatingly mumbling for that to be the case, but in honesty it was the only highlight of the picture for me.That said I don't want to criticise the actors too much. I think Gosling and Rachel McAdams do a fairly good job of what is a trite script - McAdams is best in brat mode (a la Mean Girls) in the first half hour or so of the movie - and while Gosling's acting range seems to go from being mildly amused to gormlessly distracted, it's only because he's written as such a dull goofball. About 5 minutes in I was sure that after an hour of this film I'd get sick of the Southern accents, but in fairness, they pull them off pretty well - admittedly this may have been because I was so distracted by the other problems (or, maybe, caught up in the romance....haha) but they proved me wrong on that count at least.As I said, this movie seems to struggle with its own identity - at times I wanted to laugh, especially in the scenes where McAdams' character is brutally attacking Gosling's (they fight, it's what they do, apparently) but I was fairly sure they weren't going for the Rom-Com angle, and it didn't appear to be intentionally funny. So it was supposed to be a drama? Well, the climax aside (which, as I said, did pull at the heartstrings a little) I really could not get involved in these people enough to feel anything. Not at the famous kiss in the rain, nor at the dramatic reunion at the end. Again, I think this is down to the writing and direction - the actors are doing the best with what they have - but there was potential here. Without giving too much away, the action cuts back and forth between modern day and the 1940s, and again it's derivative, but that's not a problem as long as its done well. But it's not. The pacing is agonisingly slow. It doesn't help also that there is absolutely no subtlety to it - yes, that's fine if it's another Romantic drama, it's expected, just do it well, but they were clearly trying to do something a bit different, and it just doesn't work when everything is spelled out to you and treats the audience like children.So it's a 5, and it would have been a 3 but for the efforts of the actors and that last fifteen minutes. Now I know a lot of people like this movie, and if you're really into romantic dramas you'll probably get something out of it, but for me, there are just too many problems to allow a good ending to let this movie off.",The Notebook

297,cybertigger1,Not your usual chick-flick,8,28 August 2006,"I think a lady friend of mine wanted to rent this a few months ago and I passed on it. Then I saw part of it at a relative's house and the same day rented it and watched it with the same lady friend! I thought the performances were all very natural and believable. Nothing was forced or overly dramatic, and there was a lot of humor. My favorite scene is probably when Allie is a nurse and first meets Lon who is wrapped in a body cast. He asks her for a date and says ""Before you say no, I'll have you know I'm an excellent dancer and my intentions are entirely dishonorable."" Lon is such a likable and confident guy that you can understand why it's a tough choice for Allie ... despite what Noah claims, it really isn't about the money and the security for her. Lon is every bit as great a guy as Noah is, he's just different.Even though they're very different films, this movie kind of reminded me of ""Murphy's Romance"" (which also featured James Garner). Both movies have a kind of easygoing quality to them while still packing an emotional punch. The Notebook definitely has a more ""epic"" quality to it, though.Would have rated it a 9 but I did have a little issue with the casting. I didn't think the woman who played Allie in her 80's looked anything like Allie would have looked at that age. She did do a good job though. James Garner didn't really look much like an older Noah either, but, well, he's James Garner.Other than that, a very good film.EDIT:You know, after reviewing the negative comments about the film, I have to admit I can't disagree with many of them. This film really was flawed in a lot of ways, but somehow it still worked. But the more I think about it, the more I want to downgrade my rating. I now think I'd put it at a 6.5.",The Notebook

Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are so perfect in their roles that their romance is not just limited to the screen, the audience can feel the chemistry between them.The relation between Allie and Noah is very beautifully showcased. Their romance, silly fights, their conversations, serious fights, etc all are depicted very naturally. The initial phase of their relation is beautiful and pure. They are mad for each other and are kissing for most of the time(and even got awards for it). Slowly as the conflict arises we cant help but feel for these poor couple. Every part of the story keeps us engaging and has a suspense element to it.The only complaint I have is with the length. Had it been less lengthy it would have had more impact. Rachel McAdams has shown that she is a fantastic actor. I ve become a fan of her after watching this movie. James Marsden's part, though short has an important role to play in the story. The conflict that Allie faces intensifies as we move closer to the climax. The ending of the movie is very heart touching and very original. I wish I had a love story like that.On the whole The Notebook is not just a movie but a very heart warming experience.",The Notebook

But, there wasn't any sappiness to it, which was nice. I loved the way they intertwined the past and the present, so you aren't left with any suspense...i hate leaving a movie wondering what will happen next, even if it all fiction!!! The cast did a wonderful job, especially the actress who played Allie. And, i really don't have much left to say, since I do not want to spoil anything...just go see the movie, its a wonderful love story that will make you teary eyed, which we all need every now and then!You definitely feel like you are in the movie, right along with the characters for the whole two hours!",The Notebook

Noah, starring as Ryan Gosling, and Allie, starring as Rachel McAdams's love scenes are very romantic. Their separation is so pitiful and makes me be anxious about what would happen after this.Allie gets a new boyfriend after she separates from Noah. This guy is very good man and they become engaged to each other. But Allie sees Noah again by chance. They still love each other, so Allie starts wavering between two men. I got annoyed at her indecisive attitude. Moreover, she takes it out on Noah and her mother. It is James, her fiancé, that the sorriest person.At the end, Allie and Noah get married but she has dementia. She cannot remember Noah and her children. I think there was no need for making she have dementia.",The Notebook

Their performances pulls us into their passion, their love.This is balanced out with Gena Rowlands and James Garner playing the roles of the older couple as the older Allie and the Duke later on in years of their relationship. As the story is told about their life, seeing their love for one another develop, seeing their passionate love grow for one another is wonderful to share in this cinematic experience, more than once.Another film comes to mind is ""The Family Man"" where Nicolas Cage and Tea Leoni are great together with their love for each other but in a different context.",The Notebook

304,shamontielvaughn,Worth all of the hype,10,22 July 2012,"Yes, it was worth all of the hype. I'd heard of this movie, but I'd never seen it. Even when my mother bought it and said it was because of all of the stuff she'd heard about it, I still didn't want to see it. I didn't know anybody in the film (although someone told me a guy who asked her out looked like Ryan Gosling. I looked him up and thought, ""Yeah, he's really cute""). It just wasn't on my radar. I even added it to Netflix and five minutes later removed it. So guess what got me to see the movie? The constant mentions of ""The Notebook"" in ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians."" Then I finally decided to see why in the world this movie was supposed to be so great and oh boy WAS IT EVER! It's a girl's girl kind of movie. Yes, it was borderline creepy for Gosling's character Noah to hang from a Ferris Wheel and be so disrespectful to her date, completely ignoring him while he asked Rachel McAdams' character Allie out. You've heard this plot before. Poor boy meets rich girl. Rich girl isn't interested in poor boy. Poor boy chases rich girl. They fall in love. The parents don't approve. The couple tries to stay together regardless of parents. Girl meets new rich boy. Girl falls in love with rich boy. But what happens when poor boy and rich girl unite by accident?Nothing about this movie is unique, but the actors playing the roles are what sold it. I watched the movie three times in a row and paused during certain scenes just so I could squeal and watch them again. When it wasn't overly romantic, it was funny (the water yelling scene cracked me up, the house selling scenes were even better). The only drawback was Allie slapping and pushing Noah around. I could've gone without that, and he seemed to think it was perfectly normal. If it had been the other way around, women would be screaming about how abusive Noah is. That's the only part I don't like in girl's girl kind of movies. Sometimes there needs to be a brave guy to step in and say, ""Take that out of the script."" Other than that, loved it.",The Notebook

309,jcorpuz@ucsd.edu,SImple but wonderful,10,15 February 2005,"This movie seems to be postcard perfect, a lesson straight out of the director's guide to romantic movies. Boy meets girl at a carnival, love from the other side of the tracks, a date by the water, etc. And yet the wonderful thing about this movie is that it takes what seems like a story you've heard already (at least in bits and pieces) and still moves you deeply. It really speaks about love in a way that most romantic movies miss by speaking in cliché or over shoot by adding in numerous complications to dramatize things. There have been other great movies to comment on love in recent years (Eternal Sunshine, Lost In Translation jump to mind) but this movie fills a need that those other movies miss: the need for a straight, sweep you off your feet romance. Too bad there can't be movies like this every year...",The Notebook
310,voxhumana,Will long outlive the critics who scorned it,8,30 April 2009,"Now by all rights, this film should have been awful.On paper the plot seems fairly trite, there are so many clichéd and terribly two-dimensional characters (eg Allie's father, Lon), some extremely predictable moments such as the confiscation and subsequent return of the letters by Allie's mother (on a side note - why do people always save these letters rather than just putting them in the trash?) and some very heavy handed attempts at creating suspense (gee... is Duke meant to be Noah or Lon? Like you didn't already know.)Consequently, when the Notebook was released it was absolutely savaged by film critics for all of the above reasons. It was also condemned for trivialising Alzheimer's Disease, for being ""poorly directed"" (a common theme in many of the reviews) and for any number of other faults.OK then, so if this film is just so awful, why does it have an 8.0 rating here on IMDb? Why does just about every female in the western world own it on DVD, (not to mention the many men - like myself - who have observed its uncanny ability to get girls ""in the mood""?) My answer: it is quite simply the perfect love story, told perfectly and (despite what the critics said) delivered at a perfect pace. It is intensely passionate yet quite unhurried, just like the best examples of another activity that I'll leave to your imagination.It is timeless, and it gives substance to the dream that love can endure above all (a dream which - face it - we all buy into to some extent, even if we will never publicly admit it).Like ""The Shawshank Redemption"", this is a film which has survived critical scorn and has earned its elevated stature in the public arena the hard way.The simple fact is that people just keep buying it on DVD, people keep shedding tears to it, and critics everywhere are secretly retyping their original reviews (while fervently hoping no-one digs up what they wrote the first time).And for the record, I'm a ""man's man"" who watches lots of sport and rides a motorcycle. But that scene where Allie realises that the story is actually all about her had me weeping as much as that time when I was 5 years old and Bambi's mother died.This is a beautiful, heart-rending yet sublimely uplifting story, told with the utmost delicacy and gentle sweetness. The critics be damned.",The Notebook
311,Haynoosh,A Classic With A Lot Of Class,9,23 June 2010,"There are some films that can't be classified as artistic or commercial... The moment they open they become a classic, such is Nick Kassavetes's Notebook.Maybe it is because of the era it depicts, late thirties of the twentieth century, maybe it is the theme of first love which usually is at first sight, but while watching the film I really forgot that it was made in our times, so believable, so authentic was the ambiance. It seemed that the film had already passed the test of time.Another reason is maybe the naiveness (in the good sense of the word) ,the honesty, the pureness of the characters, both at their old age and while young.In our days , with the sexual revolution and postmodernist approach to life ,where there are no hinders getting in the way of couples, when first comes the sex , before developing an emotional attachment , which sweeps away the mystery and the innocence, it seems that love, like it used to be , exists only in novels and films,the classic ones of course.Films like this make us realize the compromise we have made in our hectic journey towards progress , it is not just the memory of the characters which shakes , ours does too. If the past relationships were doomed by convention ,ours are doomed by this anarchistic liberty which like a strong flow of water makes the flower wither before it blossoms. Films like this evoke a sense of nostalgia for ""the good old days"" , despite of the horrible war and losses , from which the film quickly passes.Casting Ryan Gosling is one of the smartest choices made in a film . His performance stands out the most,after all it is his character that initiates their encounter and pours fuel to the whole faculty of their love.It is his perseverance, his incurable romanticism in believing in what he wants, however impossible it might seem , and Gosling's understated but sensitive and elegant portrayal of Noah,that contributes to the realization of his dream, their dream.Equally impressive are Rachel McAdams , Gena Rowlands and James Garner in their interpretations , which engage us in their story and convince us through the pages of their Notebook , that we need our memories to define who we are , and in spite of everything we've been through, there are pages definitely worth living , reading and remembering.",The Notebook

But that's about the only way it doesn't disappoint. It has just about every ""first love"" movie cliché you can possibly think of, and has nothing new to add to them.Unlike Jack & Rose in Titanic, you have absolutely no empathy for the characters, and there seems to be no good reason for their lives to have crossed. The two main characters keep swapping personality traits throughout the film. First one is weak, the other strong. The next scene it's the other way around.

314,bendy392,"If you're a bird, I'll give you the bird.",1,15 October 2014,"You know that movie that everyone swoons over and you're like the only person who can't stand it and can't understand why so many like it? *sighs* Yeah, this is it. The Notebook—Nicholas Sparks' most notorious story, which reached out to many people and couples. This movie is talked about by almost every single couple I know. And honestlyI don't get why so many people like this movie. I thought this was HORRIBLE!Alright, here's the story. In the 1940's, Noah, played by Ryan Gosling and Allie, played by Rachel McAdams fall in love over the summer, but there's one little problem: The guy's poor and the girl is rich. Yeah, sound familiar (Titanic, Dirty Dancing)? Oh, don't worry; there'll be other clichés along the way. The girl's parents aren't okay with this and the two are separated. World War II happens and the two eventually reconcile after seven years, but things have changed. Allie is now engaged to another guy, who is actually really supportive. So now that Allie has found Noah again, she is now torn between her old flame and her fiancé.So what's the problem? The romance is SO manipulative. For example, how does Noah get Allie's attention at the beginning? He hangs off a Ferris wheel and asks her to date him or he'll let go. Yeah! Suicide! That was the answer to everything! That's right, men! If you want to get the girl of your dreams to go out with you, just threaten to kill yourself in front of her! Yeah, you might die, but hey! Doesn't backfire! And the dialogue between them is SO damn corny and SO cheesy and SO clichéd, it makes me wonder, why should I care about these two after seeing a setup that has been overdone countless other times? And even after he threatens to commit suicide in front of her, they see each other again and they strike up a conversation. Cos that's how women would react, right? She's not at all freaked out by this?! And another thing about it is that they talk and—I'm not kidding here—They're together in literally the next scene as a couple. Just like that. Yeah, it's that rushed.And wouldn't you know it? The fights between these are so forced and half the time, they don't even make sense! After the fight from her parents, he breaks up with her and she's like ""get out of here! I don't want to see you again! I hate you!"" no, wait come back!"". What?!? Does she have multiple personality disorder?! And the second fight near the end is forced. It's written in just to make the movie seem more ""dramatic"" or a way of saying ""ooh, they're so hurt"". And the line ""I'm not afraid to hurt your feelings"". Did a guy who says that he loves her so much really just say that? ""Oh, well he's just saying that because he's not afraid to tell her when she's being unfair"". Okay, fine. But can you word that a little better?! To me, it sounds like he doesn't care about how she feels! And keep in mind; this is when she is forced to decide who she'll stay with. The fiancée is at least calm towards this and states that he'll never force her into this! The rich guy, who the movie wants you to be against, is the more believable choice!Ugh. I'm sorry, but this movie really ticked me off to see how forced and manipulative the romance is and yet it surprises me to see that so many people really love this movie and how emotionally invested they are in it. Never once did this grip me. I couldn't care less about these people except for the rich guy Allie's engaged to. I couldn't care about the couple, I couldn't care about her problems, I couldn't care about anything!Romance is written in a way for us to relate and hope that the main characters should come out okay in the end after so many hardships. It should be about a real couple, who go through relatable and realistic problems, which act as obstacles. Just show a couple trying to fight their way through hard times and not use these clichés over and over again. Either way, I know a lot of people like this, but as for me, this was god-awful and I will try to stay away from it as much as Allie should have stayed away from Noah to begin with.",The Notebook

The entire idea of getting old & looking at the past, is rather touching. The acting is definitely good & so is the script. It does portray the younger generation of today & the need to have faith in the people they love. It's a semi-rebellion that many parents & families face today with their children in relation to marriages.

They're kind of flat, she like painting (she says and it's barely a things), she's rich while he's pour, hard working boy. And they fell in love. That's the stuff.I didn't like it very much because of this, it's just a story we see from outside, and for what we see we've got to trust mainly what is said, we can't rely on what we see because we don't see very much, above all for the flashback parts. It may be a form of storytelling but it made me feel excluded, not part of the story, because I didn't feel to know the characters. And I must be honest, I don't blame just the screenplay, I think is also a choice of the director, and the actors are totally underused.Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie, but is like a story about someone you've heard: it's interesting, you listen to it, but once it's finished your life go on, leaving few traces behind, totally not leaving a mark.I watched and I kind of enjoyed, I didn't like the choices that were made, but I don't think are ""wrong"" choices, it's a good movie after all.

This is a simple love story, a pair of first lovers experienced all kinds of joys and sorrows and finally broke through. Romantic and beautiful.
However, what makes people feel different is that the whole story is interspersed in the memories of old age. The old man reads this past story to his wife who has lost his memory.
They have been together for a lifetime and have sons and granddaughters. He still had to accompany her in the last time, waiting for a miracle.
He said, because she is my baby.
At the end of the story, she finally remembered him. Although only a short time.
She cried and embraced him and told him I love you.In the midnight ward, he walked quietly to her bed and called her gently.
She opened her eyes and looked at him, calling his name. Noah, do you believe that our love will work wonders?
He said, I believe, so I will bring you back to my side.
The tears in her eyes were crystal clear. Will our love take us away?
Our love is infinite.
He lay down beside her, holding her hand tightly.
He says. I will always protect you.The two gray-haired old men held hands together and left.If the ending of the fairy tale is so beautiful, why is there so much sentimentality?
Seeing that there is still no trace of change in love even when it reaches the end of life, it is actually full of tragic color.
Such an ancient love made people cry.The reason why fairy tales are beautiful is because they are out of reach.She likes to wear red, so passionate colors, just like her character.
He was a happy and carefree man before, and she became silent and decadent after losing her.
He promised to rebuild a manor for her, and there was a room facing the stream for her to paint.
He wrote 365 letters, all of which were detained by her mother.
He experienced a war and she fell in love again.
She saw the bearded man and the manor behind him in the newspaper, and couldn't help flying to find him.
They quarreled in the heavy rain and finally realized that they still love each other.This is an ordinary love story. Everyone will experience love, but not everyone will have the love that is firm to each other.

All she says is that she loved/loves this bumpkin yet she still truly loves Allie's father. So this is the same lady that pulled her daughter away and hid letters for a year? Is she telling her daughter to go with Noah or not?? And if she is, shouldn't she had done that after she saw 365 letters??? That must mean something if a guy writes your daughter 365 letters.FINALLY, the whole way the story was told from the nursing home and the ""Notebook.""

331,jecika,Overrated,3,15 November 2008,"Before I watched this movie, I was looking for a nice drama to watch and since everyone was telling me that this is such a great and wonderful and warm and fuzzy and emotional film, I gave it a shot. During those two hours I was just waiting for something great to happen. I thought the movie was going to be remarkable, exceptional and all that, but I am very disappointed. I think this movie is just a cliché after a cliché. The guy is poor and she is rich and her parents won't let her be with him - what a classic. Of course she is all nice and doesn't know how to have fun in a way only he knows - doing irrational things which are supposed to make the characters feel as if that's the only right way to enjoy their ""love"" - lying in the middle of the road (I don't think so). And that is supposed to be fun. After 2 minutes, I knew that the old man and the old lady are actually Noah and Allie... There are no quotes to remember, nothing interesting and unexpected. Of course, I guess we all knew she will come back to him in the end, because she loves him - dirty, dumb guy with whom she fights all the time. It is obvious that she is only physically attracted to him, she acts like a really stupid girl. I have to admit that her fiancé is a little too perfect, kind of phony. I gave this movie 3 stars, because it isn't all that bad. It did make me feel tender in the end, but only a bit, nothing spectacular. I just don't understand how people keep falling for these things over and over again. It certainly does not deserve a 10. And I apologize if I didn't spell everything right, because English is not my native language...",The Notebook
332,josemedeirosforsenate13,A wonderful heart warming love story that you can grow old with!,10,3 April 2010,"The Notebook is such a wonderful and heart warming love story that I have to comment on it. I some how missed this movie in the theaters, but was fortunate to find it while browsing the video's at my local Blockbuster. It was Rachael McAdams' beauty that caught my eye, and made me want to watch this movie, but as soon as I started to watch this film, I was reminded of one of my past loves that I met, and had lost and only wished that It was I in this film as Noah kissing the very beautiful Rachael McCadams. Rachael plays a young teenager named Allie, who spends the summer with her family in a small town, and meets a young local boy who she eventually falls in love with, but is forbidden to see by her mother who wants her to marry a man who is wealthy and has a high social standing in society. Ryan Gosling who plays Noah, writes to her every day while Allie goes off to college, but Allie never writes back to Noah, and she believes that he has never written her, and he must have been using her.Finally they both move on with their lives until Noah decides to sell his home that he had promised Allie that he would some day buy, and restore. Allie by chance reads about Noah's home for sale in the newspaper, and realizes that she still has feelings for him, and although she is engaged to be married to a dashing and handsome soldier who comes from a wealthy family, has doubts and wonders why Noah never wrote her or ever tried to find her. This story also has an interesting twist when the older Noah who is played by James Gardner is reading a story to a an older woman who has Alzheimers that is in a nursing home.Each actor in this film gives a great performance, but the passion between Noah and Allie makes you feel just how much your first love will always be special to you no matter how much time has passed since you both have been with each other, or any other relationship that you each may have had in life's many twists and ironies.The Notebook is a modern day classic love story that you can watch with your children over and over again.Jose F.

They told me that it was wonderful and that I must see it. So, I decided to check it out. This movie was predictable from the start. You can predict what is going to happen at the end of the movie as well as climax. It was the same thing that you would see in other love movies. So what makes this movie so special? I don't know. The only thing that saved this movie was the fantastic acting. The older versions of the kids really had great chemistry together. They were truly great. Almost all the scenes were great because of the acting. I would recommend it, but not as my first choice of a romantic film to see. It is not the best romantic film but is one worth checking out.",The Notebook
334,sweet_cuppin_cakes,"Behind every selfish love is a stupid, boring story.",3,8 February 2005,"The Notebook is a film that epitomizes many people's hatred of chick flicks. It's a simple, prototypical story that you've heard a million times before.Poor Boy meets Rich Girl. Poor Boy does something crazy to get Rich Girl's attention. Poor Boy continues doing crazy things, and convinces Rich Girl that there's more to life than being rich and doing rich guy stuff. Rich Girl starts doing crazy things; crazier than even Poor Boy would do.Poor Boy and Rich Girl fall deliriously in love with each other over the course of two months, when Rich Girl's parents try to interfere with the young couple's love. (In The Notebook, Rich Girl's father has his villainy exacerbated by the presence of facial hair, a la Star Trek.) Rich Girl is torn away from Poor Boy. They lose touch, because someone has chosen to conceal Poor Boy's efforts to contact Rich Girl.Poor Boy goes to war, and his buddy (who has received all of two minutes of screen time earlier in the movie) meets a tragic and sudden demise.Meanwhile, Rich Girl forgets about Poor Boy and gets engaged to Rich Boy. Poor Boy comes home, his dad dies, and he goes nuts and bums around for a living.Rich Girl becomes suddenly aware of Poor Boy again, and goes to visit him. A playful frolic in the rain leads to a steamy extramarital affair (poorly lit, of course... this IS PG-13, after all).Rich Girl's mom decides to let Rich Girl know the truth about Poor Boy's attempts to communicate with her. Rich Girl decides to go with Poor Boy, ditching her fiancé. Everyone still thinks she's the greatest thing since chocolate covered gummy bears. Love predictably conquers all, and Rich Girl and Poor Boy grow old and die in each other's arms.Utterly clichéd.All of this is centered around Poor Boy's obsessive and maladaptive golden years. Rich Girl has succumbed to Alzheimer's, and doesn't remember a thing about her life until Poor Boy reads her the agonizing story of their lives together. She then comes to for about five minutes, then goes nuts because a strange man is caressing her and referring to her with terms of endearment. Poor Boy's children and grandchildren are at home, and they miss him. They have their wits about them, and they need him. Poor Boy insists that Rich Girl needs him, but she isn't even aware of who he is until late every night. He's just another stranger until that time. Why wouldn't he stay at home with the people who love and miss him, and visit Rich Girl every week or so? On the day that we are so greatly blessed to witness, she wakes up in the middle of the night with all knowledge of her life thus far, then goes to sleep with her husband Poor Boy, and never wakes up.It's depressing, immoral, predictable, and a hulking bore, yet it is promoted by most everyone as being a great and wholesome love story.Don't listen to the people who recommend this. Eat glass before you watch this movie. It'll be easier on your stomach.3/10",The Notebook
335,nhmphuong,lovely story!,8,30 March 2005,"What can I say about the movie??? It's just a love story of two 17 kids named Noah and Allie. The notebook seems nothing special so farThe love story is romantic, very romantic indeed, just like many other beautiful love stories. Two kids are crazy about each other but ""as usual"", it doesn't work out when they are young. A couple of years later, when they grow older, they meet one another again and the spirit as well as the chemistry between the two still exist so strongly. Then, nothing could prevent them from being together.The plot is admittedly predictable. However, Until now, I can't fathom why I don't feel the movie any disturbed. Probably because that kind of romance is rare in this modern world. In the end, old Noah and Allie die (together), to me, that is the best ending of the movie. A relaxing piece of romance for the weekend! 8 out of 10.",The Notebook

In movies, usually the things that are changed are scenes and little twists but in this film they have changed the behavior of the characters, from awesome gentle people to social idiots. The way they have changed the behavior of the characters was a huge disappointment. The movie wasn't even close to what the book was portraying, the main theme to ending, everything is changed.

Basically if you enjoy escapism through romance and a happy ending is a must, then this is the movie for you. If you are cynical as far as love and romance is concerned then forget it. The litmus test is ... if you like 'Love Story' you'll enjoy this. The acting is good and the story develops slowly but surely but the subject of the story is purely romance and if you have no interest in this then basically this film is boring.",The Notebook

Finally I decided to watch it through, I'd heard all the stories and all the jokes about how sad ""The Notebook"" is and everyone is bawling always by the end. I've been told I have to watch this film I just have to. I didn't shed a tear and usually I have a few it's not like I never cry in movies this one just was so cliche that it was so predictable so you knew what was going to happen. The movie was built on cliches the girl choosing between the steady stable man or the risky choice. The film was so slow paced and simple it's just like any other Nicholas Sparks movie - they are literally all the same. Also how did they end up dying at the same time? Was Noah even sick? It's very poetic and all but COME ON! and how Allie would remember some things out on and off always at the right moment.

It uses incredibly tired and cheap ploys to get the audience's sympathy. Its only slightly redeeming quality is the pairing of Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams.

So I rented Five Easy Pieces and The Notebook, both of which I had not seen. The strange thing is, that in both films, the lovers played the Chopin Prelude for Piano for their loved ones. How often does this happen, thats why I mentioned the Five Easy Pieces.The story was wonderful, no-one can forget their first love, no matter who you are with, and no matter how much time has passed.

344,down-emily,"a bit overrated, isn't it?",7,2 January 2009,"Whilst I found this movie nice and somewhat inspiring, I had to face it, it was nothing new or innovating. But I guess that wasn't the aim of the movie itself. It was meant to be a heart-warming romance drama and it was just that. The problem is that if you make this kind of movie where you have two parallel stories going on, you have to be able to make them blend. Now, I think here the direction didn't do such a splendid job, since I felt the stories were cut and didn't connect. Also, the acting was a bit wooden when it came to some characters. Rachel McAdams...is as usual a cute, interesting presence; nevertheless, in some scenes she tries to hard to act either like the victim or the American femme fatale and it doesn't work for her. Ryan Gosling however, really shows some acting props with this movie, because he basically keeps this movie going. I have to hand it to him; this is a chick flick but he turned it into a real adaptation. If it wasn't for him, this film would probably collapse at one point from the sappy pressure points. His cool demeanor mixed with a flaring angst really convinced me he was not only in love with her, but was also trying to treasure that love. The chemistry between the two is OK, not perfect, but it works for the early 20th century. I find it interesting that two completely different people get to have this kind of connection. The guy who wrote the actual book, Nicholas Sparks...OK, now this writer gets on my nerves sometimes because all his books are about these kind of things. Don't get me wrong, the man writes nicely, but overusing the same themes tends to put off some readers. Returning to the movie, I found the symbol of the notebook a nice touch and the tender relationship between the elderly couple really great. That was a lot more convincing than the youthful version of them. I'm giving it a seven because it did have a lot of potential, but that was lost sometimes in some unimportant scenes, or worse, skipped completely. People who love romantic movies and especially tear-jerkers should see this one since it will satisfy their expectations.",The Notebook

346,ostergaardof4,The ultimate romance -- beats Titanic in the face.,9,3 July 2010,"I can proudly admit that American Beauty makes me cry almost every time I watch it. At the plastic bag. Yep. It's a new definition of – something. Je ne c'est crois. But everyone cries at triumphant/tragic love stories. Everyone cries when they see The Notebook. I don't wanna admit that! But it's true. It got me. The damn melodrama got me. It is really, really good.Maybe it's because I watched Married Life so many times I fell in love with Rachel McAdams (young Allie). Maybe it's all the amazing costumes from anywhere between 1920 to 1965 that never cease to make me drool. Maybe I was in a moment of weakness and in the overwrought string orchestra got under my eyes. It's not though. What sets this movie apart, and ultimately puts it at the top of its class, is the all encompassing melodrama of the plot. Seriously, what I said about Bill and Ted being the pinnacle of stoner comedy? This is the be all end all of romantic melodrama. James Cameron, eat your heart out, Titanic only comes kinda close. I'm yet to read the novel Nicholas Sparks wrote that this movie is based on, so I don't know if the book is this tight, but the plot has all the stops pulled. He does not stop with their meeting(See Serendipity). Or their marriage (Sense and Sensibility), or even their first kid (The Young Victoria). It stops at the end. Sparks does not shy from his heroes, Noah and Allie, having rough patches and fights and other relationships. He doesn't preserve one in pristine good looks (see Titanic and Love in the Time of Cholera). Sparks and Carravetes declare that bad stuff happens and that a love preached about in romantic comedies can not only prevail, but champions over things and even knows the perfect time to quit. I live in contempt of movies that preach ""great love"" and then never show it to me. As much as I will watch Pride and Prejudice over and over, I feel cheated. No such loss of pain and loss of gain here.So, plot. Each set piece eats the heels of the one before in sparky timing (sorry, I had to. I dedicate this review to my friend Faith, and she would appreciate a good pun). If ever there seems peace between the characters we can always flash forward in time to see the couple old and her gone with dementia. The heart strings get a-tugged lickety split. What's even better is we aren't told this right away, in fact we don't know factually she is Allie until she ""meets"" her children, and don't hear Noah's name until the third or fourth false ending, but if you haven't got that figured out within 15 minutes you have never interacted with Story. Normally I'd call the director out on this sort of easy tension, but here, there are so many tiny scenes building the characters that even I, the eternal cynic, thought Allie might choose The Guy Who Plays Cyclops. The Guy Who Plays Cyclops is a totally likable guy. She even loves him. Narrator tells us so. (I could go off on a tangent here about meta narratives – turns out our narrator is Allie herself writing the title notebook so Noah can read it to her over and over until she remembers, and Noah is the one telling the story and so we don't know if she really did or if she is just writing that to make everyone feel better about her difficulty in choice between the two handsome men, but! This is a plot movie, it does not call for analysis. And I'm afraid analyzing it would ruin this warm feeling it gave me...)I could yell about the intrusive music, or the sap upon sap, but I can't. It's not just the writing. The acting is great. I mean, they aren't finding new ways to express pain or joy, not really, but McAdams and Ryan Gosling (Young Noah) manage the gamut of emotions demanded by a life (short of the tragic loss of a child or something. Noah comes close with his best friend getting shot in the war, but it's not that sort of drama). Now, Gena Rowlands and James Garner, they find new ways to express those emotions. And damn are they good. Also good about these characters is their roundness. Noah is not John Cusack or Tom Hanks or any Strong Romantic Lead. He's a lumberjack who reads Walt Whitman – more like Will Hunting, but without succumbing to cliché. Allie is a little closer to ruin. She's a manic pixie dream girl to be sure, but somehow stays fresh as a real person. She grows up, chooses things grown ups choose. She's not a stunted Natalie Portman in Garden State or Kirsten Dunst in Elizabethtown. Sparks gives each a dream, a fear, and each a parent or two for developmental purposes. Most surprising is the lack of Noah's mom. Normally a writer would jump on that, exploit it, it's not even mentioned. I am now going to read this book and if it's in the book I'm going to be disappointed, but here, its spare and touching in a way that mentioning would have just gummed into soap opera. This, and many other details are all that harnesses The Notebook from being just another tearjerker with new actors. It is a fully functional romance unafraid of where the love it preaches may wander – in sickness and in health. Finally.",The Notebook
347,dupamiaza,Things that bug me,7,28 December 2018,"The movie is nice to watch. I think it deserves a 7 because it is relaxing and moving.
There were some things that bugged me and I would like to state them:
1. In the movie, I felt that Ryan Gosling looked at least 3 years younger than Rachel McAdams, which contradicts the plot.
2. I didn't like the acting of McAdams. Gosling, on the other hand, is great. But she is superficial and I can't feel any chemistry coming from ""Allie"" towards ""Noah"", although ""Noah"" looks very in love with Allie.
3. It is unrealistic in many aspects. How did Gosling pay his mortgage if he wasn't working? Did the scriptwriter just kill Noah's father just so Noah and Allie would be free to fool around in the whole house? Why was Allie so submissive to her parents? ... and much more.
If the movie had a better leading female and was more realistic, it would have deserved a better score. It is a good movie, but the holes in the plot and McAdams's acting and the fact that she look older than her lover really bugged me.",The Notebook
348,mikenason,A little bit short of Amazing.,8,19 May 2007,"This movie kind of reminds me of Romeo & Juliet. It pretty much has the same plot. The typical couple where Allie is on summer vacation and meets her love, Noah. Allie's parents don't approve of her love because he's poor and whatnot. It seems as if Noah and Allie have an unconditional love for one another. Until one night Noah and Allie get into a fight because she didn't tell him that she was moving to New York for College. They say they want to break up but they know that it's just another fight and they will reconcile until both find out that Allie is moving back home the very next day. Noah writes her every day for a year, but Allie never gets the letters due to her mother keeping it from her. Allie goes onto become a Nurse where Noah goes into the army, when Noah comes back he finds that his father sold the house and got him a loan so he can purchase his dream house which he promised Allie that he would re-build. Allie meets a wounded soldier who asks her out on a date, they fall in love and he ends up asking her to marry him. One day Allie sees in the newspaper that Noah and Her ""dream house"" has been re-built and she decides to visit him. Both Noah and Allie reconcile and now Allie has to decide who she wants to be with. The thing that I didn't like about this movie was this whole movie was a story being told my Old Noah to Old Allie at a retirement home. Near the end we want to know who Allie chose, Noah or Lon and this is when the viewer (us) finds out that the old man telling the story all along was Noah and the old lady was Allie. This was HORRIBLE in my opinion because it shows no footage of WHAT Allie did and HOW she ended up making her decision. It just showed her saying she loves her soon to be husband and next thing we know she shows up at Noah's house with her suitcase. Then the last 10 minutes of the movie is Old Noah and Old Allie dancing and Old Allie who now has some mental disorders ends up having some panic attack, it was just a mess of an ending. Anyway the way it ends is Old Noah and Old Allie die in the bed together, credits roll. This movie was a 10 the whole way until the awful ending, which in conclusion I give an 8.

And while it is a romantic drama, let me dispel the stereotype by classifying that I am a straight male, mid-thirties, who was absolutely taken in by this movie.This is as good as romantic dramas get.  It is passionate, it is deep, and the story is captivating.  I would liken the romance of this movie to be on the same level of Titanic and Pearl Harbor, yet the plot may fall closer to Sweet Home Alabama (although not as much a comedy).  For the guys who didn't like any of those movies, you may want to skip this one as well. But for the rest of us with a soft sentimental side, this is a must-see. While it didn't actually bring me to tears (as many of the reviews suggest) it will be a movie that I will purchase when it is released for buying.One quick note:  Many of the reviews on IMDB have suggested that the character was suffering from Alzheimer's.

It will make any guy cry foreshure or at least will make your fellings and perspective of life change. Another good thing of this movie, besides the beautiful love story, is that it places the scene in times were social differences create huge abysses between human race. It did not matter if you're smart, good looking, creative or hard worker, if you came from a poor family, with little education, you had little change of living a love story with the person you'd consider, at least for that moment, THE ONE.

But anyway, the book was really inspiring. I cannot believe this movie had a high rating when it the book was much better than the movie. Plus, the book shows much more emphasis on how the two actually loved each other. The movie was just too dull for me compared to the book. My advice is, read the book first than watch this movie if you haven't. The book is the most touching love story I have read.some corrections that I want to say: this movie sort of showed two young lovers who just ran away, and just got lucky with their relationship. It actually makes the movie look bad!!!! first of all, it should have showed how much deeper their love is than making out and stuff that made themselves attracted to each other. If their love is that shallow, it just shows some madly in love teenagers who would break up eventually. Plus, there were a lot of scenes that was totally different from the book. when they make book movies, they must show what the person is thinking even though they can't exactly blurt it out, since it is a film. well, it will be more difficult to do this, but they have to find a way, because everything comes out differently when it is just acting.",The Notebook

Guy tries to reveal secret, but something prevents him from doing so. Girl then learns of this secret & breaks up with guy. In the end, guy wins back girl"". Ugh.........please put a bullet in my head! The Notebook is NOT one of those ""original romantic movie"".I'm very impressed with the storyline here.

Good, now that the machismo-infused bashing and criticism is out of my system, THIS MOVIE WAS WICKED! I had actually won this movie in a VALENTINE'S DAY contest of all things, this year (2005), and my girlfriend and I watched it a few days later. We actually did cry during the ending (which you may seem coming, but it doesn't really save your tear ducts any work, just kinda warms them up). The cinematography and matteur-en-scene/character proxemics are definitely the high points - Cassevetes has done well in his romantic endeavour. Gosling is surprising. At first, he seemed to have a Ralph Fiennes in ""Maid in Manhattan"" creepy-romantic vibe, but his character is simply earnest to the point of disarming, it's revealed. Anyway, this movie was durn good. If you want to remove the splinters from your eyes, watch this.

359,blondeems-452-74374,"Beautiful, romantic love story",10,19 August 2012,"The Notebook is one of my all time favourite movies, for lots of reasons. I'm a sucker for anything romantic, and the beautiful love story of Noah and Allie is one I will remember always.I first watched this movie with my elderly Grandma, who had been happily married to my Grandfather for fifty years. My Grandmother caught Polio when she was in her twenties, and for almost fifty years my Grandfather cared for her, loved her, worshipped her, until it was out of his hands and she passed away. But when we watched the movie together my Grandma turned to me, crying, and said softly ""I'm so glad they made a movie that shows old people can still be in love"". This is so true. Many people write off old people as slow, boring, and at deaths door. I hope this movie changed some opinions. My Grandma and I cried buckets, long after the credits rolled.Noah is the type of man every woman dreams of, almost too good to be true. The love that he had for Allie was just beautiful, after watching this I set my standards pretty high and luckily found my Noah. The two leads had so much chemistry together it was outstanding (and they went on to date for years in real life after the movie).The lake scene was by far my favourite scene. Like Allie said ""it's like a dream"".",The Notebook
360,groktalo,"Overly sentimental, but not boring",4,28 January 2013,"Having seen the relatively high score by both the public at large and the critics, as far as a romance movie goes, I had had pretty high expectations. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. It is clear from the very beginning that the intention of the movie was to get viewers' eyes well up with tears in response to over-the-top sentimentality. At the end of the movie, I felt neither entertained nor in any way enlightened. It seems that 'The Notebook' is trying to tell us that the true love happens only once in a lifetime and we can all guess what the rest of the message is. Granted, the love story is presented without too many clichés, in the very beginning at least. In sum, if you are into overly sentimental romantic dramas, this is a movie for you. Otherwise, it's not terrible to watch, but far from great.",The Notebook

Unsophisticated and emotional, yet permanently keeping you wanting to see more, every time the old lady is asking ""And what happened next?"" I think the beauty of this movie can't thoroughly be expressed in words. The recurring image of the lake filled with swans is perhaps defining for the magic of this film. As the story unfolds, the beauty of the scenery mingles with the beauty of the feelings and of the characters. The film makes one start caring for the two from the very first moment we see Noah and Allie in the park and wraps us up with melancholy as the past and present scenes alternate. The acting is at its best and moves a string of emotion in one's heart at most of the times. Allie's exuberance and passion, the quiet yet burning look in Noah's eyes, the old lady's lost and fearful look, old Noah's endless devotion and hope.If you haven't seen this movie, I think you should give it a try and expect more than from a typical romantic story. Romantic or not, I believe this film will wake up emotions in anyone's heart.",The Notebook

The framing device used to tell the story is quite appropriately like Princess Bride's, considering the condition of Gena Rowland's character. I haven't come across a film that uses Alzheimer's so effectively to further its plot and mimic the character of the couple's relationship. It seemed obvious to me who the old couple was from the start, but the final scenes still swept me away. In fact, many scenes were contrived or hokey but given the context they didn't bother me. There were some holes in the plot regarding the young couple's time apart, but the performances of everyone in the film are so fantastic that they can be overlooked. Garner and Rowlands have exceptional chemistry in their scenes, and it was nice to see such a rich opportunity for mature actors to exhibit their talent.",The Notebook

It showed a romance that's really perfect that love will really, really conquer all, just like what Noah said, ""It's not easy we have to work for it."" One thing that I always look for in a great movie is the plot. This plot with its twist and turns, curves and bends are really like a roller coaster that you wouldn't know what would happen. I love how they used time to tell the tale. It was also quite refreshing to see a story finished 'till the end. The actors and actresses were really fantastic.

So I finally caught it on cable and was blown away. It's a beautifully constructed story, set in a South that doesn't exist any more, but with enduring themes that aren't dependent on a particular era. The part that really impressed me, aside from the rock-solid performances of James Garner and Gena Rowlands (and the others) is the way her illness is handled, and the way that feisty love plays out to the very end. My mother was not able to communicate verbally after brain bleeds, and for 2 1/2 years I talked, she listened, she nodded, squeezed my hand, and we figured out how to speak to each other. Even so, I don't think she knew who I was, or if I was even there, in the last year of her life. Just as Gena Rowlands came to see the staff as her family and caregivers, my mother did with the staff at her nursing home. But I could feel for James Garner's character, knowing she was there, and might give a flash of recognition. That dedication and love that lasted to the end was what can still call up tears as I think about certain scenes.",The Notebook

As Allie and Noah, the beautiful Rachel Adams and handsome Ryan Gosling do it justice. The cinematography is well done with two scenes involving birds that are outstanding, if a little over-the-top. I found the picture entertaining and wasn't disappointed by the performances. I was glad to see that Ms Adams can act as well as look gorgeous. Ms Rowlands accurate portrayal of the devastation of Alzheimer's disease is especially poignant with the recent death Ronald Reagan.

The whole movie holds you in captivity and suspense, watching time move forward in another's life while wondering where it all meets up to in the end. Each actor/actress IS the character, and the film is directed and filmed perfectly. As things begin to reveal themselves, you feel the frustrations of the characters while at the same time admiring their courage and strength, and you hope beyond hope that things play out 'properly'.

There is nothing interesting about the plot whatsoever, and the ending of the film made itself apparent right from the start. Expecting warm characters, good acting and a fun storyline, I was extremely disappointed. Instead of portraying the experience of falling in love as being the truly magical thing it is, this movie makes it seem dry, tasteless and liable to put people to sleep.Thankfully I watched the film on DVD, so I had the fast-forward button readily available for the boring, wide sweeping 'romantic' scenes.

The love in that film is the love everybody dreams of and the heartbreak is something nobody would want to encounter.I haven't actually mentioned much about the story line of the film for two reasons, one is i just wanted to express how much i liked this film and how much it touched me but also because i knew nothing about the film when i bought it and i think thats the best way when watching a new film.I can't wait to see it again, recommended to everyone, especially if you need a good cry.

Ryan Gosling was wrong for this part for a number of reasons, the part needed a good actor. He had about three emotions in the movie, ""smile"", ""loving anger"", and ""lonley"". That's all. The role should be contended for best actor at the Academy Awards, but they had to give it to someone based on looks, it's ridiculous. James Garner and Gene Rowlands were just pathetically fake.

In Seabrook Island, South Carolina, local country boy Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) is smitten with seventeen-year-old heiress Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams) after seeing her at a carnival, and they share an idyllic summer love affair. Noah takes Allie to an abandoned house, which he explains that he intends to buy for them. Later that evening, she asks him to make love to her, but they are interrupted by Noah's friend Fin (Kevin Connolly) with the news that Allie's parents have the police out looking for her. When Allie and Noah return to her parents' mansion, they ban her from seeing Noah, whom they called ""trash, trash, trash"". The two break up and the next morning, Allie's mother announces that the family is returning home to Charleston. Noah and Allie have no choice but to move on with their lives; Noah and Fin enlist to fight in World War II and Fin is killed in battle. Allie becomes a volunteer in a hospital for wounded soldiers, where she meets an officer named Lon Hammond, Jr. (James Marsden), a young lawyer who is handsome, sophisticated, charming and comes from old Southern money. The two eventually become engaged, to the delight of Allie's parents, but Allie sees Noah's face when Lon asks her to marry him. In the present, it is made clear that the elderly woman is in fact Allie, who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and cannot remember any of the events of the film so far. Duke, the man who is reading to her, is her husband, but Allie cannot recognize him. Back in the forties, the day after Allie arrived in Seabrook, she and Noah renew their relationship. Allie's mother appears on Noah's doorstep, telling Allie that a jealous Lon has followed her to Seabrook. In the present, Duke asks Allie whom she chose. Becoming lucid, she remembers that the story Duke was reading is the story of how they met. Young Allie appears at Noah's doorstep, having left Lon at the hotel and chosen Noah. Elderly Allie suddenly remembers her past; after finding out about her illness, she herself wrote their story in the notebook with instructions for Noah to ""read this to me, and I'll come back to you"". But soon Allie relapses, losing her memories of Noah. She panics, not understanding who he is, and has to be sedated.The best thing about this movie was the depth of the plot and the actors playing their characters so well. The soundtrack was very subtle but it was appropriate. There's lots of fade in and fade out like the memory suppresses or the moment is over. It was filmed entirely in Charleston South Carolina. the scenery gave it a romantic summer feel. Even after they broke up the high angles of the water and trees were very pretty. The only drawback was Allie slapping and pushing Noah around. I could've gone without that, that's a Gosling trait I've noticed. Everything was very convincing, the place and time they were in, every ones mannerisms. The narrative definitely made the entire movie.At the heart of this film the couple represents the love story that is being told by James Garner's character. He reads from a book, the story of the two lovers as they go through everything life has to offer. Gena Rowlands plays the lady that he is reading to, and she gets as wrapped up in the story as we do, as he progresses from chapter to chapter in the novel he is reading. Garner was perfect for this role, and shows his narrating skills as he explains how the two of them live. Gosling always gives such a real acting job you know he must fall in love with all he female cast members. The supporting cast was good, and James Marsden deserves a mention for managing to pull of a hard role as the ""rich man"" well. Another plus point about this movie was the great script, and you did not see too many ""clichés"" which is always a good sign in a Romance movie. The story is so genuine and Ryan Gosling as Noah and Rachel McAdams as Allie prove their golden status in future acting (Gosling definitely more than McAdams) The story has a great feel to it because of the settingThe scene of the rain on the lake where Gosling says how he wrote 365 letters and nobody can resist the last scene where they die holding each other's hands. I never cried in this movie. But the most heartbreaking and touching part was when Rachel McAdam's when she relapses into dementia and has to be sedated. James Garner was so in love with her already and it was like in the earlier scenes when they were falling in love. When he lost her he sat there crying and it was really touching and showed his acting capabilities.Watching this movie makes you feel many things. Sadness is one thing experienced by this great love story. However what made me sad after watching this movie is just how our life just passes by and eventually reaches an end. At the end of this movie the old couple have a lot of trouble with sickness and dementia , its just like they're waiting to die and the view of the lake at the end just gets u thinking that they were once young, in love having fun and looking for great things ahead in their lives. When they die its like all their love, all their life would just be forgotten and the sad part is this would eventually happen to all of us.",The Notebook
390,woodyteegra-1,Fantastic,10,23 September 2004,"It's my film of the year so far. Forget about the clichés, the seagulls, Allie the elder's tasteful turnout etc, this is a first class love story. The mix of the present and the past was exceptional, Noah and Allie present and past was acted very convincingly. An exploration of senile dementia and the test to see if real love can break the barriers that medicine can't. Can a teenage summer romance last a lifetime? I thought the scene where Noah's girlfriend comes to visit was very well done, even though later on Allie's fickleness is a bit upsetting. And while you know or think you can guess how it will end there are a few subtle slight swerves to keep you guessing. Will Allie have an accident, who is the old guy Duke, Noah or Lon? And Gena Rowlands was fantastic as the Allie the elder, I almost fell in love with her myself and I am 30 years younger. Definitely worth the $10 entry fee and if you see it on DVD cuddle up with your other half and be prepared for the sniffles cause it's touching if you have a heart.",The Notebook
391,jameslamont,An Heartwarming movie that makes your insides go mushy with emotions!!!,10,3 January 2005,"I went into this movie with the misconception of thinking this was just another typical romantic movie, but I was very impressed by this film and the themes portrayed in this movie were handled in a great way.This movie will have you feeling happy and joyful and the scenery is just brilliant. You will feel like you are part of the characters, and you will care about them throughout the whole movie.The movie gallops in speed as we are absorbed into the great plot and brilliant acting of all the cast involved. Ryan Gosling is brilliant as the shy and quiet Noah, and Rachael McAdams is superbly beautiful as the star of the movie, Allie.As I said earlier in my review, I did go into the movie not expecting much and that was because I thought it was a typical ""boy loves girl"" movie which are sometimes just too predictable. Don't get me wrong, they are some good Romantic movies that pull it off very well, but there are simply too many in that particular genre.The best thing about this movie was the depth of the plot and the actors playing their characters so well. The supporting cast were good, and James Marsden deserves a mention for managing to pull of a hard role as the ""rich man"" well. Another plus point about this movie was the great script, and you did not see too many ""cliches"" which is always a good sign in a Romance movie.It does not matter whether you love romantic movies or hate them, this is NOT just a romantic movie it is so more than that. By the end of the movie you will feel a whole heap of emotions. You will be talking about this movie for a long time.The only bad part about this movie is the length, which I think could be shortened a bit but on the whole this was a superb movie which is well worth a watch.Go and Watch this! Amazing movie which will have you brimming with joy.9 1/2 out of 10",The Notebook
392,per-69,Greatest love story of all time!?,10,26 June 2005,"I had been circling around this film for some time. I am not usually one to jump on love story's, but I do love a good drama. I feel silly writing this, but what really made me want to see this movie after all was that it was mentioned on ""The O.C"" as the best love story ever.I know this film probably does not contain anything you have not seen before, but it is just simply told so well that you are totally engulfed in the whole story.Also Ryan Gosling again delivers an Oscar worthy performance and this film certainly should have been nominated for movie of the year.As for Rachel McAdams, I did not recognize her from Mean Girls. She just looks ten times more beautiful in The Notebook.",The Notebook
393,dan-v-spurling,This isn't just another love story - it's life,9,14 April 2005,"What a fantastic way to be entertained! ""Titanic"", ""Gone With the Wind"", HA! THIS movie is where it's at. The movie wouldn't have been the same with a different cast. Stellar acting and an incredible story make for an all-time great. This is a film that should definitely be in your video library. This film is in my opinion one of the greatest love stories ever told.On occasion you just do something at the spur of the moment for no real reason. Watching this movie was one of those things for me. I had no idea what the gist of the film was nor did I care.The story is about a couple of seniors living in a retirement home. The man reads a story to the woman and takes you into the story. You actually feel like you are in the story with them. The transition from seeing him read to her to taking you into the film is so smooth and effortless that you don't even realize it has happened. It is just as natural as breathing air. The story starts out with a couple of kids falling in love. Their parents are opposed to the match and take the girl away. Time goes by and they do their own thing. Her thing is her thing while his thing is living up to the promises he had made to her.Several years go by and she is getting ready to marry an elite socialite, which pleases her mother to no end. As fate would have it, she sees a picture of her former love in the paper and runs home to see if there is still any ""fire"" left. Of course there is, and what a roaring inferno she has stumbled upon! The old lady in the retirement home has dementia so she can't remember the story from the last time he read it to her. All she knows about it is that she loves hearing him read it to her. To her, the story is ""lovely"" but only vaguely familiar.********SPOLIER DON'T KEEP READING UNLESS YOU WANT THE SPOILER ********The story reveals only shortly after you figure out that the seniors are a couple. Not only are they a couple, but they have been married for many years. If you haven't guessed by now, ""The Notebook"" from which the man is reading, is a journal of their long lives together. The story being told is their story.It is the story of their time together and their time apart; how she forgot him and how he kept her memory alive in his heart and soul.The man has chosen to live with his wife at the retirement home even though she doesn't remember who he is. Their children and grandchildren visit and she meets ""his"" wonderful son and grandchildren for the ""first"" time again. They want their father to return home and abandon the mother since she can't remember who anyone is. He has vowed to never leave her alone. The nursing staff even tries to quarter them separately but he sneaks back to her bedside whenever he can. As all true lovers would dream of, they pass into eternity in each other's arms while sleeping peacefully.",The Notebook
394,Cpartak,Beautiful Film,9,20 May 2005,"I went to watch ""The Notebook"" because my girlfriend had read the book and asked me to come watch it with her. Being a guy who does not enjoy romantic movies very much I was very reluctant about seeing this film. However, I can honestly say that I was blown away by this beautifully written, acted, and directed movie. I had only seen Ryan Gosling in one other movie, ""Murder by Numbers"", and was impressed by his performance in an otherwise forgettable picture. He has a great charisma and on-stage presence that few other actors have. Similarly, Rachel McAdams truly shines here in her breakout role as a rich southern girl who falls in love with Gosling's character. Not to be outdone by their younger counter-parts, Gena Rowlands and James Garner are also excellent in this film.There are many things that I truly enjoyed about ""The Notebook"", most notably the simple but poignant love story between Noah and Allie. I think one of the hardest things to do in a film is to show true love, which is so rare in real life, and thus extremely difficult to replicate on screen. Nick Cassavetes does an exceptional job of presenting the story without any sappy or phony elements that would have made the film cheap and predictable. Instead, he allows Gosling and McAdams to become the characters of Noah and Allie and they take it from there. Their performances are truly outstanding, I could honestly feel the love between them in every scene. This was a completely new experience for me because I rarely watch romantic films, and even more rarely find them to be believable.I would recommend this film to everyone, both male and female. I know that most guys will be hesitant to watch this movie, but they should not be. If you've ever been in love, and if you've ever felt about someone like you've never felt about anyone else, you will enjoy ""The Notebook"". And even if you've never been in love I think that you will find this movie to be an honest and sincere story about two people that never stopped loving each other until their very last moments together.",The Notebook

They say it's true love, but their ""True Love"" movies, like this one, always has a part in which the female character is cheating. In this one, oh yeah, she's so in love with her first love, and yeah, the mom prevents her from receiving his love letters and everything, but she eventually moves on and falls in love with another man. But as soon as she sees her first love, she starts falling for him again. That's cheating. And she eventually goes back with him. Oh, so true love! But what about the guy she was with and about to get married to? The fact that women love that kind of movie gets me confused. Is any woman on this planet actually faithful? Or are they actually at risk for falling for an ex anytime? I may sound weird, but that's my feeling about this kind of movie.",The Notebook
399,gunnar_zero-1,A powerful romance/drama that will stay with you after it ends.,10,6 January 2011,"I know this is a late review for a 2004 film, but last night I finally had the pleasure of watching this movie, in company of the love of my life and I have to say this movie touched me in so many ways (good ways), that it is hard to explain the scope and depth of it, while masked as a typical romance, the story follows a young couple from very different social environments during the middle 30s, they are deeply in love with each other and there is such passion between them, the chemistry shown on screen is great, both Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling do a great job, the way they talk, the way they smile, the way they move and touch each other, it is completely believable. Though the longest portion of the movie plays as a standard romance movie, it has a sub-plot running in the background which I will not reveal, because it is by far the best part of the movie and at the very end it becomes very important and the most touching and moving part of the movie.I must admit that is not a movie that will appeal everyone, this is a sweet, moving and at times very intriguing movie, the editing is amazing, the photography leaves you breathless and the art department deserves a special mention too, all the costumes are perfectly designed, the outfits are a delight to watch.The sound department made also a great job, both the sound mixing and editing as well as the musical score are wonderful to hear, the score runs smoothly with the scenes without distracting you from what's going on, not for one single second.I cannot recommend enough this movie if you enjoy romance and drama, especially well acted, beautifully shot and effectively directed romance and drama, you will find yourself laughing at the very clever yet simple humor and roughly half an hour later crying at a very emotional scene.If you have any doubts about watching this movie, or if you haven't seen it yet but want to do it, do yourself a favor, don't wait any more and get it and watch it. But do yourself a favor and do it in company of your significant other, this is not a movie to watch alone, is a movie to share with the one you love.10/10",The Notebook
400,pwykes,"Predictable, unremarkable romance flick",5,15 May 2005,"The first half of this movie is a cliché-fest - just about every lame love story cliché is trotted out: the boy who does outrageous things to attract the girl, the poor boy who falls in love with a rich girl who has parents who are shocked because the boy is beneath her (that one's only been done thousands of times before!), first love being the only true love, etc.It was also obvious to me from the start who the old characters were and it made it somewhat annoying to hear James Garner referring to his character in the third person as he narrated the story.The movie improved somewhat in the second half, once the boiler-plate romance was out of the way and it started to become somewhat original and more enjoyable.

When they died at the end ,yes it was sweet, but how many times do you see that happen in life? The only thing I can say that was outstanding is the acting. They did do a very good job.Other than that I thought the movie was just a simple movie i would give it a c - because I've seen so many other movies that touched my heart and The Note Book wasn't One of them.

It is based on the love an old couple still endures for one another, with four wonderful actors portraying it. Gena Rowlands and James Garner(in their older years), and Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gostling portraying the younger version of Allie and Noah. With all the trials they had to go through to be together, they surpassed it. This movie has really inspired me to find love as they did. I am encouraging all who read this to please watch The Notebook, it is a beautiful, heart-warming and inspirational film about lovers who surpass struggles and trials to be together.

I was persuaded to do so by friends since it was characterized as the ""best movie ever."" I therefore decided to take a chance. After watching it, I am happy to say I was not disappointed. This movie was the ultimate love story. It was not a mushy piece of crap like some other love stories that have no chemistry, emotions, plot, and so on. I was so moved by the movie, and even caught myself falling for Noah. His character has a love for Ally that all girls dream about having. It was pure and real. There was more to it than physical attraction, there was true emotional depth. This depth was portrayed to viewers throughout the movie. I even wanted to ring Ally's mother by the neck a couple of times, because I was so into it. The acting was phenomenal and the story itself was wonderfully captivating. This is definitely not a movie I will be leaving on the shelf to collect dust!! If you feel like renting a movie, I highly recommend this one... or you could take a chance and buy the DVD like I did.

I hope the studios paid the author a lot of money to rewrite his story! The character of Noah was totally changed and I could count on my hands the number of scenes or events that actually occurred in the book! I can't believe how many liberties they took with the story!!! It was totally ruined for me. Entire segments of Noah's life were omitted. Noah was shy and not the type of person to hang himself from a ferris wheel (which never happened in the book). He also never met Ali's parents during the summer Noah and Ali fell in love. (And I don't recall Ali going to Sarah Lawrence.) And what about Ali's art career?? They mention one little picture without indicating how important that picture was to Noah. It's movies like this that make me hate Hollywood and all the talentless producers who wouldn't know a good story if it hit them over the head. Thank goodness for independent films!

Allie and Noah are the two lead characters and they are wonderful. You immediately fall in love with the characters and you want to follow every step of their doomed love story. it is one of the greatest love stories ever told.

Plus, the film manages to capture much of the novel's insular quality, although the characters are far more developed for the film than they were for the book. The novel has an almost claustrophobic feel to it, while the movie is all about wide open spaces. Still, the director played the scene with the geese (or whatever they were) on the river perfectly. It looked exactly like I envisioned it when reading the book.I was surprised at the acting ability of Rachel McAdams. I thought she deserved to be nominated, but she has to get a few more films under her belt before people will forget ""The Hot Chick.""

Seeing a girl whine and bitch about how she isn't allowed to do anything because of her parents is annoying and pathetic enough but when it involves a boarding school that's preparing one for an Ivy League college, this just reaches new levels of ignorance. The theme of finding a true love after spending years shitting your pants and forgetting the names of all those you ever loved except for one stands out as a selfish and sappy moment not to mention the repulsive character Noah dangling himself from a Ferris Wheel to get the girl to go out with him shows desperation beyond anything even I would try.",The Notebook

422,ALB,"Unreal characters in an idealized, sappy romance",4,3 August 2004,"The main thing you need to know about this romantic would-be tearjerker is that it's based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks, he of ""Message in a Bottle"" and ""A Walk to Remember"" fame. Like those films, this is more interested in portraying an idealized romance than real love. Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling are the two lovers, one rich, one not. It's supposed to be the 1940s, but you'll barely notice--even World War II barely intrudes. An ultra-thin plot device prevents them from living happily ever after well before the film reaches feature length. Meanwhile, in the present day, James Garner is an ever-faithful husband who can't let go of Gena Rowlands. She's got Alzheimer's and only rarely recognizes him. The end reveals the none-too-surprising connection between the two stories, though the events of the intervening 40-plus years are entirely missing. All of the fine actors play essentially fake characters, with no real characteristics other than a certain tenacity and, of course, an unwavering dedication to their partners. To those who thought ""A Walk to Remember"" was sappy, this will seem even more so. Those who found it touching will perhaps be able to stomach the corny ending here, which implies that love can literally transcend biological reality. Oh, that it were so. ** out of ****",The Notebook

I'm not a huge fan of sad movies, but i decided to give it a shot. I was compelled into it by the first scene!! Rachel McAdams does an amazing job (as usual) and has great chemistry with Ryan Gosling. The movie made me laugh, cry, and want to see it again! The only thing I didn't like about this movie is that I had it figured out early. I like movies that I can't figure out the ends to, and this one was fairly predictable. It's pretty close to the book (I read the book after seeing the movie), but I personally liked the book better, as I usually do. Overall, if you're a sucker for love stories and don't mind sobbing in front of your friends, this is the movie for you. I gave it 9/10 stars.",The Notebook

I am a fan of Gena Rowlands and her late husband. But don't know much about Nick. McAdams is cute and Gosling was great in Lars...I really didn't want to see this movie. A friend recommended it ...so my husband and I sat down, watched the movie. And I cried. Yup, like a little sissy. The tears just ran down. In all honesty I can say that I was surprised and really inspired by this film. You don't find that many love stories that you can truly relate to. But you can with ""The notebook"". Anyone can understand the characters and basic trauma of their lives because they are ordinary. Most films are based on a platonic and ideal love, but in this story, we can actually relate with the characters and their relationships. That's why it's special. Anyone can understand it. Other than that, I have to say that the movie was beautifully made, set design, photography, etc...but the actors.... damn! Talk about chemistry!",The Notebook

I think it would have added more effect to when Noah spiraled down after seeing Allie kiss somebody else.Overall, it's a good story.

The characters are instantly likable, the storyline moves at a good pace and there's a good mix of humour and intrigue as well as the obvious tear-jerking moments.The only possible criticism is that the plot is very predictable, so you can guess how it's going to end more or less straight away... but this doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the film, as it's such a beautiful story you still want to know how the characters' lives play out.I would definitely recommend that people watch this movie at least once, but don't forget the waterproof mascara as I watched it with 4 other girls and we were all in floods of tears by the end!

For you still had to write a ""gloriously"" stupid book (and make a ""gloriously"" stupid movie based on it)! Not only stupid. Trite, empty, boring... A glorious disaster!The characters are dull! Noah is what? Manic-depressive? Manic in the first 5 minutes, and throughout the rest of the movie depressive. Does he even fit the elderly character (you know, the grandpa who winks to young nurses)? Of course not. On the contrary, Allie is always hysterical, and all I got to hear were her constant screams. She seems and sounds like she's trying to reanimate a dead person. (Noah?) That person would probably kill her after the outcome and then peacefully die again. I think she would do perfect in a role of the serial killer's principal victim. Explicit edition only!The music is simply unbearable!!!And what about the children? There is only one scene with the all three of them! How superficial does one need to be, to put them in only one scene, and have us believe that they are actually a big part of their grand love and happy fairy tale life?

He loved mom so much that he had to call on the whole divine/ demonic/ extraterrestrial/ voodoo/etc gang to make them die together?! Touchy.

First of all, it's disgusting kissing scenes and cheesy script makes you roll your eyes or throw up. I have too agree that it was unrealistic and had a happily ever after mood about it...which is not real. The character Noah has a dirty way about him, I mean he's nice and everything but he becomes a crazy alcoholic man who runs around with other women...respectful?..I don't think so! And Allie..Oh My Gosh! don't get me started. She annoyed me soo bad! she was very immature and spoiled and childish!She never took responsibility of her actions! I think that this romance was never true love but lust...if it was love they would have respect for each other, they would know how to act mature and wait till they were married. All it seemed to me was was short summer fling, it was all flirting and going completely gah-gah over each other for just some physical attraction. I think the author of the book thought that if he made the boy poor and the girl rich, it would be an excuse for love because the rich don't fall in love with poor people..right? wrong, that is no excuse for ""true love"" a rich girl can go out with any boy just to have some fun for a while and then leave him.It dosen't mean it's true love just because of status. I think the author dramatized it a bit too much so if you want to see a good, mature, romance I would suggest Message in a Bottle or hey..Pocahontas",The Notebook

As others have noted here, you will need to bring a large stack of Kleenex to this one. Which is not usually my type of film, but there is an abundance of talent on display in this one, both in front of and behind the camera, and that keeps it honest and enjoyable. Never manipulative, never cloying, it's a good old-fashioned time at the movies.Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are both wonderful in the lead roles. Him I knew, and he is again quite fabulous. Her I was not familiar with, but she is equally fabulous here. Together they are as winning a young couple as you're likely to find on the screen these days. And of course the old pros, Gena Rowlands and James Garner, hold up their end of the bargain in fine style. And the supporting roles, in what could have been horrible caricatures, are done beautifully by some very fine actors. Both the screenplay and the direction are restrained and first-rate.Grab your tissues along with grandma and grandpa, and go see this one.",The Notebook

I often read the reviews and try to find both good and bad and after awhile I get a feel for what a movie is going to be like; most often it is, and for that I love IMDb.Now, on to this movie and this post. For over 10 years, I've used IMDb in this way and never felt compelled to write a review about a movie. Well, we just finished this and my wife doesn't cry to often for movies and well, let us say I do. This movie had many tissues and out loud laughs and tears or should I say weeping from BOTH of us! I guess when you have loved others and you know you aren't in what you could have had or perhaps you are or think you are then this movie will rate super high for you.

My favorite moment is when Allie returns to Noah and shrugs her shoulders. At that point Miss Calhoun's memory returns through the Alzheimer's haze and the young lovers are reunited. The realistic depiction of Alzheimer's as she loses those memories is heart wrenching. Without giving it away, the ending is ""perfect"". Kudo's to both set of actors.

If this movie doesn't move you nothing will. It is full of passion, romance, and emotion. The use of the flash backs makes your love for the characters so much stronger. The whole movie is layered with beauty. The casting for this film was very well done. Ryan Gosling has a lot of gravitational pull here in his depiction of Noah. His charming performance shows how much potential he has. You can never go wrong with James Garner. Sam Shepard, and Joan Allen put in very strong supporting roles as parents of the young lovers.

I didn't have huge expectations about this movie, but I decided to see it even though critics had mixed reactions to this movie. About halfway through the movie or even before, I cried like a baby. I fell in love with this wonderful drama/romance. And it's a good movie, and it doesn't matter if people don't like romances, because that's not what it is the whole time.It's set in the 1940s in North Carolina, and I have to say, the scenery was beautiful and it made me feel like I was actually there. The story starts off with the rich girl Ally (Rachel McAdams), who's vacationing with her family, and the not-so-rich, guy from ""the wrong side of the tracks"" Noah (Ryan Gosling) and they so happen to meet and eventually fall in love, even though it's forbidden by Ally's mother because she thinks he's ""trash"". But they continue their romance. I liked Rachel McAdams's acting in this movie, but for some reason, I wasn't too hot for Ryan Gosling's performance; I thought it was mediocre. But that is the only negative I got from this movie.Nick Cassavettes wrote this, along with "" A Walk To Remember"", which, don't get me wrong, was good, but I believe this was my favorite by far. I would recommend this to basically anyone, even men, since I know guys who have seen it and they have cried as well.

The way the movie portray's the nursing home's staff deference to him as he cares for her is a big part of the movie.Being a Canadian I was also impressed with the acting of the two main characters who both hail from Ontario.My wife also agreed with the previous comments about the movie (although changed from the book) stuck to the original story and was enjoyable.Another sleeper that I hope will get seen lots by word of mouth.,The Notebook

The idea of the story is great and heartbreaking but it was just presented much better in film. I never heard of Ryan Gosling before this film but now I have a great appreciation for him as actor as well as Rachel McAdams. They were the perfect couple who had amazing chemistry on screen.

Usually, when books get made into movies, the movies never live up to your expectations. This is definitely the exception.The story that Sparks laid out is incredibly beautiful and sweet, but the movie does something that the book doesn't- it has a lot of when they first meet and fall in love. This takes up about three pages in the book, but it is a big part in the movie, and that's really nice watch.After seeing this movie, Rachel McAdams quickly became one of my favorite actresses. She does such a great job, and so does her co-star, Ryan Gosling. They look great together, and they really look like they're in love.Also, this movie is one incredible tear-jerker. I cry easily, but I had never ever seen my mom cry. When her hair caught on fire at thanksgiving, she laughed- but this movie had her bawling right there with me.This is definitely a movie belonging in the chick-flick category, it is basically as sappy as it gets, but there seems to be something there that guys can like as well.

The real test for them is with Allie's disapproving family and once they get separated by WWII. But something brings them back together, always. The few complaints about the movie I had were like I feel they could of shown more of their lives while they were separated. They only show Noah in WWII for like 2 minutes.

Such transitions are better suited to a book where there are defined chapters, i would have preferred the director/editor to create a more unique way to link in the two concurrent stories. Also, I couldn't really engage into the older characters, granted the tale of forgotten love and losing one through memory loss is a harrowing and deeply sad situation, I just felt as though for whatever reason, this issue was dealt with kinda cheesily by the film. A lot of this rests, I believe, with the older character of the husband, I found him to be very wooden and a poor fit for the younger character, the relationship between the characters as their younger selves and the older selves felt very forced and not at all as a singular flowing tale. The final issue that griped me was the abrupt end to the younger tale. I would have preferred to see a little more of Annie's transition into her chosen path in life, instead we were left to just leap onto the tale of the older characters which weren't nearly as engaging. That being said however the tale of the young loves carried enough weight for me to suitable engaged and still enjoy the film.",The Notebook
459,sudip_chowdhury,too mush silly for 8.0,3,19 October 2008,"Its really a silly romantic movie made by Nick Cassavetes.I tried my best to enjoy it but terribly failed.I did not find anything remarkable to rate this up to 8.0. Gosh.....Its a trap.I like romance but it must contain a minimum standard obviously not something like ""Love at first sight"" or ""and then they happily lived ever after"" or ""born for each other "".The movie starts with pre-affair condition between two teenage noah and allie like all other cheap teen movies and then breaks them up by highlighting the financial discrepancy between two families. The ending is horrible as well that tries to prove that they are in so deep love that they must die together.Comparatively ""Lake house"" or ""serendipity"" are far better than this one. Although It has placed in top 250 i have to say that it is a very healthy teen movie.As i am not a teenage anymore it breaks my heart.",The Notebook

I kept seeing a young Jimmy Stewart in Ryan Gosling-his manner, his speech. Rachel shows such great enthusiasm, it is contagious.James Garner and Gena Rowlands are old favorites of mine who always turn in wonderful performances. I always make a point of seeing their movies.The subject matter is timely and thought-provoking, the music and mood of the young people's story is quite well done.

461,thepopcornlover,Everyone wishes they had a love like that,10,30 June 2010,"No words can describe how good this movie is. No words and no love can describe or be compared with the love Noah and Allie had. This is the best movie I have ever seen, not only the most romantic movie but the best movie overall! The love story is so good and you get the feeling right from the start. There are many love stories and movies about love but in my opinion I think this is the original love story movie and absolutely the best one. I LOVE Titanic but I must say that this movie top that one. There is even a verb ""Notebooked"" when a girl makes a boy emotional and sad after watching this movie. That must say something?! Well well, this is a movie for everyone. Everyone must see this movie before they die and before they're looking for 'the one'. Or maybe not because you will keep looking and looking because finding someone like Noah is like one in a million. I also recommend the book, it's just as good as the movie! Love conquers all!",The Notebook

Now I know that I was completely wrong: The Notebook has done it.I knew Ryan Goslin for the 1997 TV Series: ""The Young Hercules"". I hadn't seen any film of him until now; and I have to say that he is an amazing actor. He plays is role perfectly. He makes you feel the story. It is unbelievable how strong is Noah's love to Allie and also it's so good the way Goslin shows it. Rachel McAdams it's not one of my favorites actresses, but I have to recognize that she has done an excellent work. She reflects, in a perfect way, the life of a 40's-teenager of a rich family.I know that if you read the plot you will think that this is another typical ""love story"": poor boy loves rich girl and they can't be together. But it hasn't got any clichés, I promise.It's one of the few movies that shows real love (and has a beautiful and good ending!)One of my favorites and more memorables love stories in life.",The Notebook
463,coltsfan1693,Beautifully done...very heartwarming!,10,20 November 2009,"This movie was beautiful, romantic, and moving. While there were a few bits in the movie that was nonfactual or unrealistic, I fully enjoyed this movie. If you're not into ""romantic, mushy, or emotional films"" this is not the movie for you! As I read some of the 1 star reviews, I find myself almost laughing. A 12 year old girl rants and raves about hating chick flicks and yet she watched it anyway. It's annoying when people write reviews for things that they are utterly disinterested in. Anyway, back to the movie! One thing that I found that was nonfactual was the condition of Ally's disease (Alzheimer's). She seemed to have moderate Alzhiemers, yet throughout the movie she switches from the mild stages of Alzheimers to the severe stages. And while it was absolutely wonderful when she remembered that she was Ally and that the man was her husband Noah, a woman in her stage of Alzheimer's would never have been able to remember that fact. However, this movie was still well done. After hearing that Rachel McAdams was playing Ally Calhoun, I was thinking, ""Regina George? The super mean clique leader from Mean Girls?"" and then ""That skinny nerd from Remember the Titans?"" But these two actors had great chemistry together and portrayed their characters beautifully. They are truly great actors.",The Notebook

Since one of them coming from rich family, you will know how the story goes. Will their love lead to a happy ending, or is it a sad one?You will have time to smile. You will have time to cry. Sometime you can feel the love, but sometime you will break your heart.The movie actually has no special thing. Alhtough the movie has two parallel stories to prepare a surprise, but I guess most of the audience realize the surprise before it is revealed.But this movie has all good love story need. Good casting (best Gosling movie, I think), good script, many good scenes.I give 8/10 for Ryan and Rachel performance and good story/script.",The Notebook
465,DaleHirst,Truly moving,10,25 August 2006,"Cast, production etc were excellent, it's the story that makes this film though. I'm a 6'5"", 230lbs, Rugby playing 22 year old male brought up on the Internet and generally as cynical as they come. However I can freely admit I cried at the end of this movie. I can only hope that I some day find a woman I love as much as Noah does Allie in this story.Rachel McAdams is wonderful on screen; a true delight to watch in anything she does but in this film she really shines. James Garner and Gena Rowlands are both exceptional in their roles, limited by screen time but pivotal in their impact. James Marsden produced an adequate performance, though I get the impression that the writers were trying to keep the movie below 3 hours so had to cut some of his part up, you really don't care that much about his character in any way, apart from how he affects the lives of the main two. Ryan Gosling was good; you really want him to get the girl though I suppose that is the minimum for the role he plays in the film. He was better as pre-war Noah than he was as post-war Noah, maybe the beard didn't allow him to express himself as much, maybe it's because the emotions are harder to express, maybe it's because he's playing the part brilliantly by showing an outer shell that appears impervious to emotions. I don't honestly know, you can make a case for all 3 but really it doesn't matter, his performance works.This film appears to have been overlooked for awards apart from ""Teen Choice"", and that really is a shame. I've certainly seen worse performances win a best actress academy award than Rachel McAdams' in this film. I guess that the year this would have been in for is the 2004 awards and Hilary Swank was very good as Maggie Fitgerald in Million Dollar Baby, but I can guarantee that very few of the also-rans can compare to her performance. The film is also very well directed, the music suits the movie perfectly and the supporting cast isn't half bad. Why this film has received so very little industry recognition baffles me.In conclusion, watch this movie. It's not a brain turn off movie by any means, so if you're looking for an easy ride it may be better to look elsewhere, but make a concerted effort to watch this movie, as and when you can.",The Notebook

I watch it constantly, it really grabbed at my heart and I don't think any other movie had made me feel so happy but sad at the same time. The saddest part for me was to see Allie suffering from dimension because as the movie progresses you really are able to connect with Allie as a character, and when it is discovered she has dimension its as if her whole life, beautiful story is gone. Amazing jobs by all 4 main characters Rachel McAdams, Ryan Gosling, James Garner, and Gena Rowland's. They were brilliant at the roles, each portraying the character to the best that I had expected. I had read this book and expected like most, the movie to be horrible compared to the book because in most cases that is how it works. I was happily wrong, this movie beat the book! I loved the detail of the younger area of their love, and it seemed their was more passion in the movie then book. For example the scene when Allie chooses to go back to Lon, In the book it was very dry with no real emotion. But the movie Ryan gosling takes control and shows really whats at loseI seriously suggest watching this movie, though it does make you expectations for men a lot higher.",The Notebook

Their ""love/hate start as a couple will be identifiable to many, I am sure. It could be compared to a present day Romeo and Juliet. The span of years covered in the flashbacks is flawed only in the casting of the two young suitors. In my opinion, their characters should have been reversed.

Really, it's just a regular love story about a girl having to choose between two guys...one of which was her first, true love. I'm glad of the decision Allie made, because if she didn't make the right one, I would of been really mad. The part of liked the most was the very ending, it was a beautiful ending.

I wasn't crying because it was sad I was crying because it was so romantic. It is a perfect movie to watch on the weekend and even on the weekdays. It was funny, sad, and of course romantic.

I don't mind romance movies, I actually like quite a few, but when I saw The Notebook I was blown away! It doesn't take long for you to get into the story, the characters are lovable (For the most-part) and the dialogue is great. When I was watching this it didn't feel as if I was watching a movie, it felt very real, I really felt for the characters, I felt as if I was a part of it, and that's not something I experience often! The acting is so good, it feels so genuine and so welcoming, I felt as if I really connected with them.This film will stick with you for a long time! It is so great; so sad, yet so happy at the same time. I have never cried at a movie before, but I must admit I did let a few man-tears flow when watching this.It was not what I was expecting; It was so much better! It was amazing; heart-warming and lovable. It is easily my favourite film, and if you haven't seen it, male or female, old or young, you must go and see it as soon as you can!

The production design is well done, specially selecting locations. Photography and art direction is also superb. But the movie is predictable and not a real tearjerker in my opinion. I have noticed the movie has moved American audience and it is because it has same plot seeing on soap opera shows. Before the end, the predictable plot suggested by all means that somebody should die, in we got the two main character dying together (the best way to bring tears to the audience).

I knew from the beginning that the old people were Noah and Allie and that Allie picked Noah. I really didn't like Lon, or the actor who played him (whose name I cannot remember.) I think he did a poor job. Rachel McAdams was brilliant in this movie. Absolutely breathtaking. I also found myself loving Noahs character dearly. Ryan Gosling made you believe that he really was that wonderful perfect guy. I found my heart leaping at the loving sweet things he said. A+!",The Notebook

But I never did get how she lost her memory i know she had some disorder to the brain but did they ever tell how she got it? Please someone help me there if possible. Anyway The Notebook definitely has to be one of my favorite romances of all time. Even though I'm not a fan this movie turned me back to the genre. If only there were more movies like this.

I thought the way the movie played out was excellent and the way the director set it up was excellent also. The narration and going from present to past really kept me interested and trying to figure out what was going on. In the back of my mind I thought something would happen, like Garner being Noah but I was still surprised when it ended.

There was some real chemistry between Noah & Ally and that scene where Noah hears Ally fighting with her parents about how he was ""trash"" was heartbreaking. However, the second half of the movie falls flat. It's hard to pull for the lovebirds when their selfishness hurts other people in their lives. Ally's mother's change-of-heart also appeared insincere given her previous reaction to the two being together. The story is told from the perspective of future Noah & Ally, where Noah reads exerpts from a notebook in order to help Ally, who suffers from dementia, remember.

They acted well here but could not save the bland and contrived plot and the awkwardness and cheese oozing out of Ryan Gosling, as a prime example of the unbearable characterization with which the movie's 2nd half is filled. (the 1st half till they broke up at summer is pretty watchable). As Allie turned to leave Noah's house after her mother's visit and Noah broke out in a rage while reciting superfluous dialogue with a stiff palm on his chest, I just could not watch his performance for a second more (good thing there wasn't any more of it)! How on earth does a man sound so justified at getting mad at a woman leaving him, necessarily and potentially temporarily to sort out a melodramatic mess because she's engaged to someone else? Here's a loser who spent all his life missing a girl without any other ostensible ideals or goal in life (given I didn't read the book), and whose morals and maturity, assumed to be sound by default owing to an upbringing of stereotypical paternal love and wisdom, are now collapsing into a heap. Other parts that made me laugh/cringe include widow on the verge of going back to loneliness, her place taken by a prettier and richer girl, experiencing sublime feelings of love and hope, cheesy teary old Noah, and Joan Allen's sudden hysterics of ""I love your father"". So every rich girl needs a poor boy and then gets split for romance? I always thought the American depiction of love and human nature is much more true to life, but it seems traditions are traditions, from the Qiong Yao and Korean dramas to America in the 40s, lol.

You will feel like you are part of the characters, and you will care about them throughout the whole movie.The movie gallops in speed as we are absorbed into the great plot and brilliant acting of all the cast involved. Ryan Gosling is brilliant as the shy and quiet Noah, and Rachael McAdams is superbly beautiful as the star of the movie, Allie.As I said earlier in my review, I did go into the movie not expecting much and that was because I thought it was a typical ""boy loves girl"" movie which are sometimes just too predictable. Don't get me wrong, they are some good Romantic movies that pull it off very well, but there are simply too many in that particular genre.The best thing about this movie was the depth of the plot and the actors playing their characters so well. The supporting cast were good, and James Marsden deserves a mention for managing to pull of a hard role as the ""rich man"" well. Another plus point about this movie was the great script, and you did not see too many ""cliches"" which is always a good sign in a Romance movie.It does not matter whether you love romantic movies or hate them, this is NOT just a romantic movie it is so more than that. By the end of the movie you will feel a whole heap of emotions. You will be talking about this movie for a long time.The only bad part about this movie is the length, which I think could be shortened a bit but on the whole this was a superb movie which is well worth a watch.Go and Watch this! Amazing movie which will have you brimming with joy.",The Notebook
497,TheBoss19872006,Groundhog Day: The Drama; A Walking Cliché,6,20 March 2005,"*Spoilers* Before people pre judge my review because of my ""Name"", let me just say that I wanted to like this movie. I have the capacity and appreciation to like this kind of movie. Unfortunately this film couldn't make me enjoy it. First of all this movie leaves no surprises. Everything is predictable and those who were ""surprised"" haven't seen any movie that has intense twists and turns. Also let's count the clichés: 1. Girl Meets Poor Boy whom she falls in love with. 2. Dancing In The Street 3. Parents don't approve of poor boy cause of his background. 4. Girl Leaves boy. 5. Girl meets another rich guy who is equally charming and good looking. 6.Parents approve of rich guy. 7. Girl runs into first guy and they fall in love again. 8. Now girl has to choose between rich guy whom she loves is the ""smart"" choice and Poor guy whom she loves passionately and is the ""right"" choice. 9. Old people looking back at the past. 10. Memory Loss 11. The Ending (Im not gonna give it away just so others can see how obvious it is.) There were,however some things I did like about this movie. How anyone can not like James Garner is beyond me. The film also captures it's time setting very well and looks beautiful. And every cliché it uses it executes well and is believable. The Acting is also very good. In the end this isn't really a bad movie its just not original and in a world with cookie-cutter genres originality is the only thing saving hollywoods soul.",The Notebook
498,Manil,Beautiful!!! I am still in tears.,10,26 November 2005,"What can I say that has not been said already? I only had this movie because of a curiosity in Rachel McAdams after seeing Mean Girls. I had forgotten the why when I watched it, not expecting much. It starts off slow, but give it about ten minutes and you are hooked! It's a captivating story far beyond the average movie.This is one of the most beautiful and romantic films I have ever seen! It moved me like no other movie has. Sure I have felled a few tears before, but this time I was in tears, not in sorrow, but because their love was so beautiful! When he reached the end of the notebook, I thought there was no way it could benefit from any further storytelling. I paused the movie and calmed down a bit before I went on, only to be in tears when the credits rolled. It's just beautiful! Need I say I'm a 27 year old man? I cry once a year. Maybe! If you haven't seen this film yet and have a heart in your body, you have to see it! Especially recommended for couples of all ages. Or perhaps for people searching for that special someone.It is the story of true love. (and maybe you need to have experienced it to truly value it.)",The Notebook
499,donricodelavega,Why is this movie sad?,7,22 February 2005,"This is a good movie, don't get me wrong. But its not sad because its romantic. Its sad because the end of the movie revolved around watching older people's lives fall apart. I'm sure anyone who has parents can relate to the fear of knowing they have fewer days ahead then they have behind. Now take some people in their later years and show their lives falling apart, well of course people are going to cry. Its a terrible thing. Tacking on flashbacks full of a moderately interesting love story is just a con into making people think this is one of the most romantic movie of all time. It is romantic, but so are lots of other movies. THIS movie just wanted to make you cry. So I'd compare it to watching a love story, then showing someone drown a bag of puppies. That would be sad too.r",The Notebook
500,dwight_b,"A nice movie, but a bit predictable and unoriginal",6,14 February 2005,"I found the movie enjoyable since the actors did a very good job and they had very believable chemistry. I also thought that Rachel McAdams did a wonderful job portraying Allie. Unfortunately I felt that the movie was a bit predictable and plagued with little production problems. I (unfortunately) am one of those movie watchers that loses touch with a movie when I see errors in it or am easily able to guess what's going on. My three biggest complaints with the movie were it's predictability, minor technical errors and odd casting. Predictability:My first gripe arose at the very beginning of the movie when the unnamed old man arrives to read a story to the also unnamed elderly woman. I was IMMEDIATELY able to guess that she had memory problems and that he was going to be reading a story about their lives together. I don't know exactly why I was able predict this (I think it was a combination of various things), but I assume many people were able to get the same impression right away. Again the movie continued to be predictable when Noah's friend mentions that Allie's father is extremely wealthy... how obvious was it that her parents weren't going to accept a poor lumber worker into their family. This 'wrong side of the tracks' storyline is so cliché that it has its own expression... 'wrong side of the tracks' (see ""Love Story"", ""Cocktail"", ""Pretty In Pink"", ""Say Anything"", etc.) In one scene some rich family friends ask Noah how much money he makes, at least when the scene was originally shown in Titanic (oops another ""wrong side of the tracks"" movie) it was believable, in this movie the guy comes right out and asks his wage- does that really happen at a dinner??? In Titanic they were clearly patronizing him, in this movie it just came across as a silly plot device. Finally, how obvious was it that Allie was going to get caught cheating on her fiancé. Oops, she accidentally mentioned that she was going to be staying in the town where Noah lives and the word got back to her mom... what a huge surprise (especially since they make sure that the fiancé repeats the name of the town she is going to be staying in... just to make sure we didn't miss that he caught it). Technical Errors:The first and most bothersome technical error in this movie is the historical revision of race relations in the south in the 1940s. There was a scene where Noah and his father were singing and dancing outside of his house with a group of black people. Again when Noah's father died there were black people at his funeral. Now I know that not all southerners in the 1940s were racist, but I think it's probably a fair bet to say that you wouldn't see many black people and white people singing together on front porches or standing side by side at funerals. Personally I think it's extremely unfair to African Americans for us to pretend like things were perfectly fair and fine back then. The next problem was when Alli is driving to town after having a fight with Noah, and she almost hits a truck head-on. I love the modern steering wheel cover in the car. My final issue with the movie was the unusual casting; specifically with peoples' ages. In my opinion Allie's dad looked like he was about 35, the fake gray temples and horrible mustache hardly make him look as old as his wife. In addition James Garner looked nothing like young Ryan Gosling, but I can't completely blame them since Garner adds his name to the films billing. The worst casting was with Alli and Noah's children. I was guessing that Allie and Noah looked about 70-80, and if the movie was in the present day they would be about 80... but their youngest daughter looked about 18 years old! Were Allie and Noah having Kids into their 60s? All in all, this movie was OK. The plot was very basic and predictable, but I have definitely seen much worse. I am also obligated to mention that my girlfriend loved the movie.",The Notebook
501,twiggy4always,The film is a little lacking in some places but rewarding.,7,15 February 2005,"The Notebook, was in my opinion, a classic love story. The amazing thing about it was, the actors looked like regular people and the story itself could be the story of many people. Which was refreshing, because too often do great stories get ruined by big names, and people who are just too pretty to be convincing as regular people. I myself, know nothing about 'true love,' find myself caught in the weave of the film.Although the opening was well photographed, it was not a good choice, because it is just boring. Some parts of the film could be enhanced by music, instead of just dialogue, and some of the dialogue was a little cheesy, but hey, its a love story.Performances by Ryan Gosling, and Rachel MacAdams are extraordinary. James Garner is as always amazing as well.The movie begs the question; what is the nature of true love?My advice, if you haven't seen it, DO.

It's the cinematic equivalent of eating one of those big plastic bags of cotton candy all by yourself...it might sound good, but you'll feel kind of nauseated after.It alternates between a pretty young couple yelling at each other and then groping each other, and their future selves in a Twilight Zone nursing home furnished right out of Crate & Barrel where all the female patients always have freshly applied lipstick. Almost all the plot points are telegraphed in about the first 10 minutes (except for that supremely stupid ending...they died happily ever after, just because they wanted to).A few observations: Why is she so surprised her mother hid the letters? Isn't that something a protective mother would do in those days? Didn't she know how to write?

""The Notebook"" is one of the most unimaginitive, exploitive films I have ever seen, and Nicholas Sparks should be curbstomped for every hour he spent churning out this garbage.Let's start with the positives. Cinematography was inoffensive and fellas, if you watch this with your special lady, you're almost sure to get laid.And now on to the negatives. ""The Notebook,"" while masquerading as a love story, in fact, has no story at all. The plot is barely existent, the characters are one-dimensional at best and impossible to like beyond a superficial level, and the storyline is shallower than a children's inflatable pool, existing solely to pimp Sparks's Easy-Bake, feel-good concept of romance. While most ""chick-flicks"" do their best to create likable characters, humorous situations, and some sort of conflict, ""The Notebook"" is content to instead show only a slideshow reel of Kodak moments, an abstract representation of our fast-food, home shopping network society's ideal of romance.""The Notebook"" is exploitive on every single level. In some ways, the film is worse than pornography, the way it masks its sleazy, purely commercial motivation under the guise of presenting a ""love"" story. In pornography, plot exists solely as a device to get from point A (the film's exposition), to point B (the sex) as quickly as possible. ""The Notebook"" uses a similar formula, but instead of graphic sex and nudity, this film's golden calf is a perfect, simplistic romance that faces conflict and challenge on the most superficial level possible. There's a massive section of the movie that contains little aside from the couple kissing each other in a variety of settings, all leading up to their first time sleeping together, which is, of course, perfect, just like everything else in this perfect, vacuous storyline.I could go on and on, but I'm only allowed 1,000 words in this particular review. ""The Notebook"" is a shallow, simplistic, and wholly idiotic view of romance that seems to exist solely to make girls horny, a goal which it achieves remarkably. That being said, the film has no value on any real artistic level, be it storytelling, character development, or even simply on the level of pure entertainment. The entire film plays out like a slideshow you might play at your wedding - highlighting all the good times and ignoring anything that might make it remotely interesting. Everyone involved in the making of this film should feel dirty, especially the film-maker himself, who almost completely destroys the pre-eminence of the Cassavettes name in this one effort.",The Notebook

That's enough.The deleted scenes on the DVD showed the explicit sex scenes if that's all you want to see but don't expect to learn much - except the vagaries of the MPAA values? PG 13? they're nuts.The basic story is flimsy, the acting is forgettable, there are zero especially good scenes, nor any memorable lines of dialogue. Anything to feel good about? Nah.

Any movie that can render such a broad spectrum of audience emotion is a piece of art.This movie has it's roots in the story of a puppy love. But, it transcends beyond that, just as Ally and Noah's love for one another does the same. This is a movie about soul mates. And, just how great love can be.

I admit it was tedious, which means I feel like being manipulated within director's hands. It could not help Allie gave up with Lon because her mother, who also suffered from in the past in terms of marriage concealed letters from Noa. But it does not justify her action, right? It applies to Noa. I feel for him, but Martha was abandoned for their sake without describing that in detail. That point does not make sense. I wanted to see psychological description of them. It was operated. It was not carnivalesque, On the other hand, something bursts in me when I associate it with my life, in which I regret it in many points. It gave me many thoughts. It encouraged me.

We often see the run-of-the-mill cliché of girl falls for guy but has an overpowering, sleazy, cheating fiancé/boyfriend/husband who eventually has to pay his dues, leaving the romantic climax where the ""good guy"" gets the girl. the notebook differs- allies husband is a genuinely good guy, he does nothing wrong and treats her well, the realism of the ending of this film, and avoidance of cliché; i feel makes it more special.The film is stacked with memorable and tear-jerking scenes. without spoiling too much, a certain scene involving a whalf is without a doubt the most powerful and emotion-packed scene i have ever witnessed.i think the key element tipping this film over the good barrier to the amazing section of movie categorizing is the chemistry between the two main characters. Ryan gosling and Rachel Mcadams simply relate, and work off each other, viewers believe their feelings are authentic.This is a rare film. its the kind of film you hope you will experience, and from this film on you will judge every romantic film against it, so it may be wise for Hollywood to give up and not attempt any more. 10 out of 10.",The Notebook
514,stuck_in_lodi,Gosling and serene setting save otherwise drab outing,4,25 July 2009,"Doesn't Rachel McAdams's acting make anyone else gag as much as me?? Ugh. Granted, Nicholas Sparks is a dismally poor writer... he relies on cliché after cliché after cliché, w/out fleshing out any of his characters or plots beyond two-dimensional predictability, but McAdams ALmost ruins the entire affair for me. Wanting to act well doesn't mean actually acting well. She is cute, perky and tries very hard, but she simply adds no depth to the bland character written by Sparks. The stunning cast surrounding her (R. Gosling, G. Rowlands, J. Garner, S. Shepard) demonstrates how flatly-written roles can be imbued w/ depth, whereas she plays it exactly as it is written: ""high-spirited Southern girl torn between Southern gentry and working-class stud"". Every time I hear her fake laugh, I cringe and have to either look away or mimic her flailings. I definitely blame Cassavetes' direction, as well; I suspect he was so taken w/ her cuteness, that he didn't recognize the vapidity of her performance. It wouldn't be the first time!! Ha ha. The remarkable acting of R. Gosling, however (have you seen Half Nelson?? Dude.), plus the stunning N. Carolina scenery, i.e., the righteous cinematography of Robert Fraisse, are what keep me coming back, time after time, even though it involves a lot or eye-rolling and heavy sighs.

I gave this movie an eight because I thought the sex/romance scenes didn't really fit the overall picture (too long; you'll see what I mean if you see this film).

Mainstream love stories are so quick to solve everything or too shallow to really delve into anything worth spending the $10 ticket price. It seems that Hollywood is more interested in a pretty match rather than a thematic delivery when it comes to the romance genre. So it was a bit of bitterness that I rented ""The Notebook"" following a barrage of recommendations from friends and relatives.Admittedly, I was skeptical going into the film. I had hated ""A Walk to Remember"", the movie based on another Nicholas Sparks novel. Mandy Moore and Shane West were so pious and pristine in that flick, that it was hard for me to find a connection to their characters. That and Mandy Moore could stand to take an acting lesson. But I digress...Ryan Gosling and Rachel MacAdams had both caught my attention before in their previous work, but in this particular story, they sparkled. The chemistry between them as Noah and Allie is electrifying. I found myself leaning so far over in my seat as I watched their story unfold that I still feel the pains of stretching today. The passion and intensity between these two actors is simply the most beautiful exchange I've seen in years.And while Gosling and MacAdams are spectacular in their roles, it was James Garner and Gena Rowlands who stole my heart. Without giving too much away, it is the relationship between Garner and Rowlands that sent me reaching for the Kleenex, and wishing on the night's most shining star that I too could experience the lifetime of love that these characters had shared. It's a love story to remember, that is sure.I was surprised to learn that Nick Cassavettes (Rowlands' son) directed the flick, and did so with pitch-perfect care and respect for this story.

525,AnneFrankfan284,It Wasn't Even About A Notebook!,1,20 August 2008,"OK,you might find this unusual,but if you are a hater of this movie and Chick Flicks in general(like me),then you won't be surprised.In fact,you might be delighted.See,i'm a 12 year old girl and i HATE chick flicks,because they are so sappy,unrealistic,uninteresting,WAY too cliché,and it gets to your head if you don't watch it.And when girls fall for this ****,they will start making their own fantasy about how life and love is,which will ultimately go wrong.Every time my mom and sisters talk about Chick Flicks,it makes me gag.They always say it is the best movie ever which i know for a fact that neither of those movies the deem as ""the best movie ever"" are no match to ""Casablanca"" and ""The Godfather"".Since i was bored,i decided to look into the bad reviews of this movie since i love bad reviews since they are so funny and spot on and i found myself laughing in delight at all of the jokes about how awful and predictable this film was and how i wasn't the only one that hated this film.I knew i wasn't the only one,i couldn't have been the only one,but still.So,when i was reading the reviews,i started thinking,why not do one of my own?Since i love doing reviews.And i never tried a bad one before either!So,this is where the review comes in.I'll start saying how i first saw this.My mom just took the movie form our grandma,she had a stroke recently at the time,so we just took the film anyway.We were all so psyched and i was psyched because i thought i would finally see a good movie.I couldn't have been more WRONG!First of all,like all Chick Flicks,the story,if there actually was one,was boring,unoriginal,uninteresting,and the worst of them all,predictable and cliché.A boy and girl fall in love,they are both very different but still in love,then the parents separate them,and they still love each other of course.They don't even really try to contact each other other than Noah that f****** p**** writing 365 unanswered letters a year.Why didn't Allie write to him,huh?Didn't she LOVE HIM?!If she did,she didn't love him THAT much.The characters are extremely one dimensional,have no depth whatsoever,i really couldn't care less what happened to them.Besides James Garner and Gena Rowlands,the acting was so horrible and forced.Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams were so annoying and unconvincing as the shallow characters.They had NO chemistry whatsoever(If you want to see AMAZING chemistry,REAL chemistry,watch Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall in ""To Have and Have Not"",and you can easily see the difference between good chemistry and bad).Noah(Ryan Gosling) irritated me the out of all the characters cause he was the typical boring,uninteresting,shallow,and so called ""sweet"" boy,i mean seriously,no girl in her right mind would date him,in fact,some people might even think he's hiding in the closet somewhere.Seriously,when it comes to a heterosexual relationship-there only needs to be ONE *****,not TWO!What irritates me most is that my mom and sisters LIKE that kind of guy.I mean seriously,my mom and one of my sisters were talking about my sis' ex-boyfriend and after mom said maybe he was too ""bad"" for her,she suggested that she date someone like ""that guy in The Notebook"",and right then and there,i rolled my eyes.Guys like that are,what i said,******!Rachel McAdams was irritating as Allie with all her screaming and ****,if she were in a Beatles concert,she would have been PERFECT.Now Rachel McAdams isn't a bad actress,she was good in ""Mean Girls"" and ""Wedding Crashers"",but she was just irritating in this movie.Maybe that's the scripts fault.And besides,the movie was barely about a notebook except for the first and last five minutes in the film.They might as well have called it ""Not Another ****** Chick Flick"".Plus Nicholas Sparks' books are a piece of **** anyway,they are all preachy and predictable and basically the same **** kind of story over and over and over again.Read Ian McEwan,his stories are much more better,convincing,in depth,and realistic and everything else The Notebook isn't.I'll probably edit this review another time,but just listen what i say:Don't Watch Chick Flicks Unless You Are Going To Believe In It Like Fairy Tales.",The Notebook
526,alex-richie,Nothing but a pretty picture full of clichés,3,14 January 2009,"To be honest I'm quite amazed to see this movie so highly rated. In many ways it's just as bad as those Paris Hilton films and should be rated accordingly. Yes I do realize that ""Notebook"" is a chick flick and being a chick myself, I do like to watch romantic, ""heart-warming"" films from time to time. But to enjoy such a film I need to be able to connect with the story and sympathize with the characters, and I absolutely couldn't do that in ""The Notebook."" It's so pathetic, made up of clichés, mediocre acting and entirely predictable plot twists, that it feels like a soap-opera squeezed into a couple of hours. Rich girl falls for poor boy (could as well be poor girl - rich boy, but that would be Cinderella). They are having a summer romance with dances and kisses in the breaking waves. Then the summer's over - real life begins, and the lovebirds are being separated by the evil rich parents (how unexpected). The boy then writes the girl letter a day for a whole year (no kidding), but the evil mom keeps the mail to herself, and in the end he gives up. By the way, the story is set in 1930s-40s, however the historical aspect has little impact on the story, merely allowing the heroine to wear red lipstick, curly retro hairdos and dresses - this is basically the only element adding color to the story. Oh, yeah, there is war in the film too. But it doesn't seem to be a big deal. The main hero enlists and there is a quick glimpse of him on the battlefield as he watches his best friend die, but the next moment he's back home and never mentions war or his friend again. The pretty red-haired heroine, gets compassionate and is once seen helping out at a hospital for the wounded in the war - her spotless nurse's dress and hat look so picture perfect, as if she's about to pose for a magazine. No wonder she catches the eye of a certain heavily bandaged soldier. In a short while he's miraculously healed - not even a scratch left, and turns out to be a super rich-super handsome guy (what a coincidence) - a perfect candidate for a fiancé. In the meantime the poor guy is still unable to like another woman and instead gets busy restoring the old house, secretly hoping that his dream girl will be back once more in his arms. The finished house looks so impressive (and absolutely impossible to have been built by one single carpenter) that it attracts the press. When the girl see the picture of the guy and his house she faints immediately (is it a comedy after all?) and decides to take a ride to ask the guy if ""he's OK."" To be honest, till the last moment I had hoped that the movie will have at least one surprise in store. None. The story was getting cheesier with every minute. The fact there is a sub-plot - showing an old man reading the love story to an old woman, doesn't make the film any more original, as everything in it is as predictable as the rest.",The Notebook

Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling both looking fresh and gave real life to the character Allie and Noah. Especially i enjoyed a lot of Rachel McAdams performance for her romance acting and sweet voice. it'll make fall in love with the story immediately. what a stupendous lake scene! Oh, i can't still come out from that picturization.

I didn't mind it but i thought it was a bit boring some scenes of the film are OK but some are dreadful i love the bit on the beach that was my favourite. When back in the nursing home i really don't see people thought it was that sad as it was just people getting older. Just because a film made you cry doesn't mean it is any good. there are much better films i think and my friends couldn't believe i didn't even shed a tear. They called me heartless but i have read comments that say they didn't either it depends on what kind of person you are like i prefer horrors. if you like romantic films this is the film for you.,The Notebook

The scenery was gorgeous, the acting was wonderful, and the script was so well-written. The relationship between the two stars was amazing, and the chemistry between Rachel MacAdams and Ryan Goseling made this movie amazing. (I am looking forward to seeing more of their work in the future.) THis is a very touching film, and quite beautiful. After seeing it, I wasn't able to stop thinking about it for days. It's a great date movie, and a wonderful film for a rainy day. Just be forewarned that it's a tear-jerker. Two thumbs up!",The Notebook
530,emmak89,"Beautiful cinematography and high-class actors, but something amiss.",7,12 August 2009,"Perhaps I wasn't quite in the right mood for this film when I watched it. It was a film I had highly anticipated,and I wanted to love it. Don't get me wrong, I did like it. It is an enjoyable and touching simple romance, moving through the ages,depicting a generation of love. I wanted to be swept away in the sheer romance. But coming away from it, I found myself thinking it hadn't quite lived up to it's immense hype.The film starts one fateful summer in the 1940s, and the young couple meet at a carnival. This is probably one of my favourite scenes in the film; unrealistic, but we know the film isn't trying to be realist – it's romantic, and that's the important thing.Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling steal the show, conveying the emotions of young love superbly; the first steps as they get to know each other; followed by the passion as the couple can never seem to agree on anything, but their love for each other.McAdams is especially outstanding in this feature, and I didn't even recognise her from her part in Mean Girls, released earlier that year. She has proved herself as a talented, flexible actress and after seeing her in this I can't wait to see what she does with the part of Claire in movie The Time Travellers Wife, coming out this year, which is based on one of my favourite books of all time.Alongside the story of the young lovers, we have the parallel story of an older couple (James Garner and Gena Rowlands). Both also play their roles well, but it's all a little predictable. Did anyone not see a million miles ahead that they would be the elderly Noah and Allie? This film does have some genuinely touching scenes; watch out for when the children visit Duke and Alison in the residential home – this one had me welling up; ""That's my sweetheart in there. Wherever she is, that's where my home is."" We also get a glimpse at what it would be like to lose a loved one to an illness like senile dementia; the painful circumstance where someone you've known your whole life can't even remember who you are.All in all, The Notebook is a pleasant way to spend two hours; with an overwhelmingly romantic and sentimental core, but coming away from it, for me it's not as memorable as other films in the romance genre. We follow Noah and Allie as they grow up; falling in love young; living separate lives before being reunited again. It tells a story we've heard and seen a hundred times before, but it does tell it well.",The Notebook
531,cool_saham,Love story that tries hard but fails to at least melt my heart....,5,5 August 2009,"Alright, so I heard a lot of hype and good reviews about this movie and people warned me to watch this with a tissue roll beside me....I finally decided to watch the movie last night and man was I disappointed....The film starts with a cute young guy hanging on wheel ride for a girl to ask her out and on top of it, he doesn't even know her just met her.How many of us guys would do something so freakish in real life.From that point onwards I knew things aren't gonna get any good and they didn't.It went the typical way of boy and girl in love but family disagrees due to class differences, the plot so overly used in Bollywood cinema. I figured out that old couple was in fact Noah and Allie pretty early in the movie so the suspense of who Allie would chose didn't excite me either and were we supposed to cry because the old lady couldn't remember her hubby...they had three children and it seems lived pretty much of there lives together happily until she starts forgetting things, give me a break, what about ""50 first dates"" (Adam Sandler) that was more tragic as there she forgot her love everyday, thus that ""pain"" wasn't painful enough for my heart to bust into tears.....and that cheesiest ending of dying together was like icing on the cake in a sarcastic way....she wasn't even diagnosed with any disease that could kill her then why she died along with him(he was a heart patient so his death was understandable) what are the odds you die with the one you love at the same time, unless its deliberate, on the same bed.Direction was okay, Script was the main culprit here.... Two thumbs down, go watch ""Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind"" instead or Bollywood classic ""Devdas"" .",The Notebook
532,sparta2012,Breathtaking! Still on my mind.,10,28 June 2004,"This movie is just one of those types of films that when you tell someone about it its hard to put into words the effect it had on you. I found myself thinking about it the rest of the weekend and obviously today as well. Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling were perfection for the younger leads. They have an incredible amount of chemistry (and charisma) and in some ways their love is just simple, beautiful, and fun. It doesn't take long for you to start caring about these two wonderful people and just enjoy watching this romance bloom into a marvelous love story that never ever becomes boring. This story will take you back to a time when you were young and carefree and make you wish you could (or will) feel that happy and so full of absolute elation again. It will either make you long for those days again or look forward to those days if you haven't yet experienced your first true and real love. I suppose in some ways (if I were one of those cynical critics), if one must be a critic then perhaps the story it is alittle cliché (as one critic stated in a review I read) and saccharine sweet. But, you know, when I am in the mood for a good romance story... that's exactly what I do want! I want to get so involved and invested in the romance and the characters. I want it to be sweet and gooey and even borderline unrealistic almost. I want it to make me believe that a love like that is not entirely impossible or even improbable,but very real. When I walk out of the theater and I feel truly moved and touched then, to me, its a great film and this film did just that for me and will probably for anyone...almost anyone. The cinematography is just glorious and the soundtrack is so smooth and lovely and just brings out the beauty of the story. Everything works here into one fantastic and eloquent package. Ryan Gosling plays Noah so perfectly and somewhat understated and Rachel McAdams is just ..a vision...well she just jumps out off screen. I think we will be seeing allot more of both of them. There isn't much pretense here either. I do get tired of the whole ""not bring them together till late in the film and make them hate each other at first and gradually figure out how they feel"" type mumbo jumbo we are so use to getting in so many love stories. Here you just watch them enjoy each other, have fun, and fall in love until they hit a couple of snags (which any couple would). You are always rooting for them and always smiling watching them. They almost make you experience it while they are. As much as I have great respect for Gena Rowlands (she is a wonderful accomplished actress) and James Garner when they would flash back to their storyline I was aching for the younger Allie and Noah to come back. But , nonetheless, their presence did add much to the film I have to say. If I have any grievance at all with the movie it was that (SPOILER POSSIBLY) near the end I really wanted to see just a hint of their life together after Allie makes her choice of Noah (which you pretty much knew would happen)... a wedding picture, them having dinner together with their young children, something, but, it wasn't to be.Its a beautiful, breathtaking, touching movie...the acting is wonderful and powerful. This story completely and absolutely tugs at your heart and I can honestly say this is a well crafted/well acted love story..one I will always remember.",The Notebook
533,kingtype,Sentimental Journey,8,24 July 2012,"Shamelessly sentimental, The Notebook is as predictable as a dimestore romance novel—it is based on the bestseller by Nicholas Sparks—but director Nick Cassavetes pulls it off.The story of enduring love is told in evocative sequences set to Billie Holliday's and Chopin's music. The effect offers something for anyone who has ever been in love, yearned for love or, through the movie's tear-jerking narrative involving an old couple (James Garner and Gena Rowlands), watched loving parents grow wrinkled and gray.After a carnival courtship that's so corny you expect the cast to break into a show tune, mill worker Noah (Ryan Gosling) and aristocratic Allie (Rachel McAdams) spend their pre-World War II summer days in Technicolor, skipping through small town streets, dancing with Negroes on the back porch and vowing undying devotion under the stars. Though modern sensibilities creep in, the design, the score and especially Karyn Wagner's costumes keep The Notebook in its 1940s Southern setting.Cassavetes tenderly recreates romantic moments, letting still waters, creaky houses and booming thunderstorms set the tone, and The Notebook works best when indulging its sense of suspended time. The lovers are separated as implausibly as they were enjoined—through the clichéd rich parents—and the story follows their lives through war, work and maturity.Sparks' lovers are intended as the warm-up for something more resonant than a youthful romance, and The Notebook's couple is too plain to be fully engaging, despite an outstanding performance by Gosling, who's as sincere as a wide-eyed prom date fixing his lady's corsage.It's the older players, particularly Gena Rowlands, under direction by her son, Cassavetes, who breathe life into the Hallmarkish saga. Transitions between present-day narrative and the past are tenuous, but the hokey lovers envelop the audience in their gauzy world long enough to build momentum for The Notebook's climax—a formulaic manipulation that Miss Rowlands, Mr. Garner and a fond performance by Jennifer Echols as a nurse play to the hilt.The script is more romantic than real and consequently less dramatic than it might have been. Friends, fathers and fallen soldiers are forgotten, dialog is stilted and characters are riddled with inconsistencies, especially young Noah and Allie, whose tribulations ring false. Several cast members stand out, including James Marsden (Cyclops in X-Men), wasted as Allie's rich suitor in a role that deserves more screen time, Joan Allen as Allie's mother, and Jamie Brown, who delivers a memorable scene as a war widow.This sweet Southern romance, ripped from Jimmy Durante's schmaltzy ""I'll Be Seeing You"" and anchored by Ryan Gosling and Gena Rowlands, plays its love story straight and Nick Cassavetes, cast and crew and New Line Cinema have created a poignant if sappy movie about two people in love for a lifetime. In an age of death, doom and destruction—on and off screen—that's worth something to talk about",The Notebook
534,rebelliousrose,Bring the whole box!,8,4 July 2004,"For anyone who may remember the Coca-Cola Young Filmmaker trailers that used to run before movies, flash back to the one in which all the women exit the theatre sobbing and wailing, and then the men all go to the men's bathroom and the scene inside is of all the formerly stoic men weeping copiously and comforting each other. I can't speak for the men's room, but after The Notebook, there were no less than six women in the ladies' room passing each other paper towels and crying. It's purely amazing, the variety of sounds people make clearing their nasal passages in sad movies. That said, The Notebook isn't necessarily a great movie; at times it's far too over-invested in either its own cuteness, or worse yet, wallowing in histrionics. (The only person in this whole movie who maintains the ability to cry with dignity is the always amazing, arctic Joan Allen.) It has a few young director flaws (Hey, Mom, look at me!) the most prevalent being the camera stays on the women at the expense of the men; there's a very lovely scene between Ryan Gosling and Rachael McAdams in which poor Ryan Gosling is lit like Dracula and seen only from the side. Unless he couldn't stop laughing, I'd have liked to see his face, too. The story is simple, and there's only one explosion. It's a gentle, loving movie, and a true oasis in a summer of whizbang special effects. There's more genuine emotion and chemistry between all FOUR of the leads than in any other movie so far this summer- and I include Dunst and Maguire in that list. It's a good watch, and a good ""sad"" time. Bring the whole box of tissues. You'll be wanting them. I'll be the one with the Puffs.",The Notebook

The Notebook follows the story of 2 lovers from beginning to end. It was lovely to see two romantic leads (Rachel McAdams as Allie Hamilton, and Ryan Gosling as Noah Calhoun) portray the journey of innocent young love to passionate love reuniting. Seldom in Hollywood do we see 2 romantic leads that have so much chemistry between them! The slightest look from Noah or Allie could put a huge smile on my face. Yes, the movie is cliché, but what romantic movie isn't? This is by far one of the best, if not the best, romance movie that i've seen. The acting is superb (not only by Gosling and McAdams, but in supporting roles like James Garner, Gena Rowlands and Joan Allen) the scenery is beautiful, and (as I mentioned before) the chemistry between Rachel and Ryan is AMAZING. I didn't feel like I was watching two actors portraying Noah and Allie, I felt like I was watching THE Noah and Allie. Expect very marvelous things from Rachel McAdams in the near future!

537,skebo,Tale of love for men and women,9,24 June 2005,"Let's get this out there right away, this movie is about love, and for a lot of guys myself included it was hard to get past that and really enjoy it, but I did. About ten minutes into the film I said to myself I like this guy Noah (Ryan Gosling) and for me thats what made it work. I wanted him to get the girl. Most romance movies make the male lead so weak and feminine (no offense) that men can't relate to him and say ""that's a real man"". But Noah is real, he is a hard worker, knows what he wants and is dedicated to it, and like most men he doesn't know how to get it. I've read the book years ago and Ryan Gosling really brought Noah to life and was a different style of male lead, and was so crazy that he made me believe he would wait that long for one woman. As for Allie well I think every guy wants a girl like this, but there aren't many around anymore. It works for the time though and this movie really does show enduring love and that it can exist and overcome anything and everything. The Notebook is the first film I've seen in a long time that brought me so many different emotions and left me thinking for days. Guys give this movie a chance if you haven't already, besides your girl will love you for it.JC",The Notebook

When the credits began and the lights came on, half of the audience was wiping there eyes. Its a love story of first loves, but it is also a tragedy.

Not only are the characters believable but James Garner gave the best performance ever in the scene where Allie does not recognize him as her husband. The only thing I didn't like was the pace of the love story seemed a bit rushed at times,esp the scene where Allie goes back to see Noah and the dream house he built. Still, a fabulous movie that left everyone in the theatre in tears the day I saw it! I would see this movie a hundred times! Another scene I thought could have used more time for development was the one where Allie's Mom took her by the site where her former love worked and told her about her past relationship. It would have been nice to have seen Mom actually open up to those feelings more instead of tearfully brushing them aside. The ending was so touching with the scene in the Nursing Home and it caught me off guard a little, I was not expecting them to do that and it definitely captured the heart of the audience. At one point I thought it would be interesting to learn the response of others who are dealing with Alzheimer's or other memory loss disorders and see if they felt the movie approached the subject with authenticity.",The Notebook

It really speaks about love in a way that most romantic movies miss by speaking in cliché or over shoot by adding in numerous complications to dramatize things. There have been other great movies to comment on love in recent years (Eternal Sunshine, Lost In Translation jump to mind) but this movie fills a need that those other movies miss: the need for a straight, sweep you off your feet romance.

I have to say that this is probably James Garner's best work that I've seen. He captured the essence of his character to the max and his emotions seemed so real. Second of all, Gena Rowlands doesn't do bad movie. She was incredible and while the part was understated, her performances were so powerful they were heartbreaking. I literally ached for her character.Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling were perfect in their roles of young lovers, torn apart by class distinction, war and doubts. Their story was pretty classic, boy smitten by girl, woos girl, wins girl, loses girl. But that's NOT the whole story, it's only the beginning.I was impressed how the movie handled some life issues. Not to give anything away, but you will cry and you will see yourself in this story or at least someone you love. There is some suspense, definite fun and the drama is not over done at all.

What makes this story somewhat different is the way it is presented: an old man reading the love story to an old woman in a nursing home. It was the two senior citizens and their relationship in the movie which touched me the most. The main characters were wonderfully cast and make the story come to life. The setting in a small southern town makes for some lovely scenery.

Both are romantic but this one is a little bit dramatic for older watchers. I think all lake houses have a romantic side. Actually this movie has two different point of views, for both young and old watchers. The 40 and 50's style of life in USA is quite well done with fantastic scenes. And you can realize not only how appearance change by time and also how people live and think. I was expecting a better end but again I am sure most watchers loves the end. But still I am not sure it is a good end or bad.. Briefly, If you liked ""Lake House"" I am sure you will love this movie, too. Everyone should see it.",The Notebook
547,GNie65,Loved it!,10,14 April 2005,"It was romantic & stirring all at the same time. You just want to hang in there & see for sure who Duke (James Garner) actually is from her past loves. I think the movie makers all did Nicholas Sparks' story very well. I will see it over and over again through the years, like An Affair to Remember and The Way We Were. It will definitely stand the test of time like those classics and even though it identifies clearly what time frame the ""younger"" scenes take place, it's really timeless. A story like this could happen today or in the future. The soundtrack is gorgeous and is romantic and relaxing to listen to on CD. I highly recommend this--not just as a 'chick flick' either even though it really is. (What Nicholas Sparks book/movie isn't?)",The Notebook
548,jenise-louise,Amateurishly overwrought,3,20 May 2005,"I can't believe I lost two hours of my life to this film. I'll never get them back, oh woe.Good acting by Rachel McAdams and whoever played the young Noah--I'll give them, Sam Shepard, the actress who played the character Martha Shaw, the old cars and oh gosh, the woman who played her mom--a well known and excellent actress--three stars. But the rest of the film was amateurishly overwrought, to quote myself, both in the use of music (ridiculously loud and swelling at the emotional trigger moments) and many of the lines, particularly those given the older couple. The war scenes were fake-looking and gratuitous. And finally, terrible casting of Jim Garner and Gena Rowlands -- SPOILER ALERT!!! -- there's no way these two could have ever been the younger two in their past lives, particularly Jim who's too Jim Garner to play anyone else but himself.",The Notebook

Don't get me wrong,there are a lot of good movies, but this one is undoubtedly the perfect movie. I recommend it to everyone in the world...it's awesome! Perhaps it is the extraordinary acting or the absolutely genius love aspect. Whatever it is, this movie is incredible. I can't believe that it took someone this long to make it. From the beginning of the movie, my imagination was captured and at the end of the movie, I was captured. The movie is so inspiring and I can only think that it's the job of all of the actors that made it that way. You will never feel the same after watching it.",The Notebook
550,QTPie730,Crying Has Never Felt So Good!,10,6 April 2005,"There are many reasons why you cry. You can cry because you are so happy that you can't control your emotions anymore; you can cry because someone hurt your feelings in one way or another; you can cry from getting hurt; and you can cry from wishing you were someone else. In the movie, The Notebook, that was why I was cried, because I wished I was Allie. If I wasn't Allie in the movie, then I definitely would want to be the old lady. Despite her disability, the old man seems very devoted to her, and devotion is not a thing that comes along everyday. The movie was sweet in so many ways. It was very long, but because of the constant problems that occur, it felt like it was over as soon as it started. Sometimes love stories over do it and become cheesy. This was not one of those cases. Even though I knew exactly what was going to happen in the movie, because come on let's face it unless you see the movie opening night someone is going to slip, I still found myself crying at parts that weren't even sad. My friends laughed at me after the movie, complaining that I made too much noise, but I thought to myself, crying has never felt so good. Usually after a movie I've cried in I'm sad, but this movie I cried because I was overcome with a good feeling in my heart. I recommend this movie for girls or guys that haven't cried in awhile, because trust me, it will feel good!",The Notebook
551,sbharti,Notebook is about ageless undying Love,9,29 December 2007,"I have seen many love stories as movies (and I'm sure most of us as well), so by now I've somewhat become averse to them. Notebook was for long in my list, but I kept pushing it away because everyone told me its a love story. Today, When I watched it, I must say that I was missing something for that long time, and I'm happy that I watched it.At the bottom, I didn't find Notebook's story very different. Teenagers falling in love, getting apart and their further extensions have been long portrayed in cinema and novels. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams played roles of young Noah and Allie beautifully, and justified to the roles. Rachel whom I have seen as a naughty girl in Mean Girls and Hot Chick was really sweet as an innocent cute girl. I was impressed with James Marsden too, though he shared screen for short time. However, all this wasn't all which touched me. James Garner and Gena Rowlands had to come to screen.Most will say there was only one story in the movie, but I found there were two. James as old Noah along with Gena as old Allie do not share much of screen, but they grow their own love story in unique way alongwith Ryan and Rachel. Where all would take months and years to win their ladies, James does it in one day! As the story unfolds, all characters look good, but what touches you is that one day love story.As the way I made my title, Notebook is about that love, that ageless undying love, which remains in each of us till we die, or even after death who knows. I gave 9 for 10 for those touching moments.",The Notebook
552,rhmcewan2003,Redemption for Nick Cassavetes,7,15 March 2005,"After a terrible film in JohnQ, the notebook is much much better and actually a great movie. I liked the notebook because first off Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams do fantastic jobs being in love with each other. They often give snug facial expressions that really sell their characters. Their on screen chemistry is great and the development of Noah as the ""regular"" guy is heart felt. He was truly a genuine character. When certain choices are made in this movie I really found myself caring and hoping that certain things would happen. That is what makes a good movie; caring about the characters and their journeys. When the movie stays on track and focused on the two main characters relationship it is great, but when it tends to go off it you feel its need and you want it back faster than you get it. One part I did not like was how Martha was brought into the story and in particular the scene when she leaves. It serves no purpose towards the story and her character has no reason being in the movie let alone this scene. We only want to meet characters that serve a purpose. Other that that I thought the end could have come shorter because you get the big pay off and there is still like 15 minutes left of the movie. But anyway this is a touching film and It is definitely worth me seeing it again.",The Notebook

It really made me appreciate my boyfriend, my life, and made me so happy. I cried so hard throughout the whole thing with every other person in the movie theater male and females. The scenery and acting was amazing and it is by far my favorite movie. Couples were walking out of the movie theater hugging and kissing and you could tell it touched many people. It makes you realize what is important in life and yet some may say its cheesy i thought it was wonderful and really portrayed true love.

In a true love affair, as so appropriately shown by the wonderful acting by James Garner and the rest of the cast, you never give up on your loved one, even when that means being someone new in their life every day.This story touched me, as well, because I had just lost my husband of 20-years within 6 months of viewing the movie, and had experienced many of the same things during his final days.This was the movie that James Garner was made for; his acting skills could not have been more ""right on.""",The Notebook

The characters playing the younger versions of the leads were so void of personality that I just didn't care if they ever found each other again. I think this film wanted to be a deep and moving testament to the power of true love. I'm sorry that it lacked that sort of gravity. It was more like the English Patient on a half a Valium and a tab of X. The leads wallow around in sappy, sobbing love scenes that didn't move me as a viewer. The most irritating part was the dismissal of the Young male lead's girlfriend when the female lead moves into the house. They all have coffee and everyone is fine with what is happening. She drives away in her car saying what a great girl the female lead was, after it was well established she had great affection for the male lead.this film was a waste of time.",The Notebook

A love story that's so beautifully woven into such a precious tale, signifying the ever lasting emotions that true love can express, in such a sublimely beautiful manner. I so deeply regret not seeing this beautiful movie in the Movie Theater... instead I saw it on DVD. It was brilliant... Simply Brilliant. No other movie could ever touch my heart and soul the way this did. Being the biggest cynic of sappy chic flicks, I was thoroughly moved by this wonderful tale of romance.

Take my advice and watch it, u definitely wont regret it. If you're a sucker for love stories or just a hopeless romantic this is your movie. Enjoy it.Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling are the PERECT Allie and Noah. They have such chemistry and such a raw talent it's almost impossible to stop watching until the end.

559,SilthDraeth,A Moving Tell,9,2 July 2005,"I was pretty reluctant to watch this movie, as I had heard so many comments on it. Most of them good. Some of them bad. Other than that though I purposely did not read to much about the movie except for what was listed on the back cover. After finally picking it up, all I can say is do not let other's opinions make the choice for you. Good or bad comments often ruin a movie experience for me.If you are like me at all in that respect, I urge you to just watch the movie. It isn't unpredictable. It isn't tragic, or happy. It seems a bit unreal, and hard to believe in today's world, where promises mean so little. This movie embraces what love is all about. Some macho people may call it it a chicflic, but to me that is just being afraid of the stigma of showing emotion. Where would human kind be without love? It seems movies like Troy, and Lion Heart are OK because men are killing other men, and fighting for love. But a movie that shows another side, of living a normal life and still fighting for love is somehow anathema is ridiculous.Just watch the movie.",The Notebook

It was a beautiful movie and have definitely put it at the top of my favourite movie list, its so detailed and makes it more interesting that it swaps from present to past and keeps you on the edge thinking whats going to happen, also you begin to ask your self questions such as do love stories like these truly exist?",The Notebook

He will always be the simplistic, loyal, romantic nice guy, and she will be the noisy spoiled girl that never made any decision in her life. And they will always love each other, no matter what happened to them. Also, the old couple bits thrown in the middle were a bit unnecessary in my opinion.

That's OK except the renderings are kind of inane. It's hard to imagine someone going ape for the girl - especially three times. I guess the movie maker is hoping to convincingly romanticize his mom.

566,ryanator390,This movie is romantic,10,18 January 2006,When i first heard of this movie i thought oh great another of those boring romantic movies where the two people fall in love but this is more than that. This is taken in 1940 where two young teens fall in love but then separate cause Allie is going to New York to go to school. Then seven years has passed and Allie has a new boyfriend well is engaged. Allie goes back home to find her first love and fall in love with him all over again. I especially like the lake sequence with the ducks. Overall they ended up but in a good way cause it kept you thinking who will she stay with Noah or Lon. It is also a good film cause Duke's (Noah) love Allie can't remember anything and he has to read her the book of there lives so she can come back to him. Overall i give it a 10/10. The best performance is by Rachel McAdams. She is a great actor and i hope to see much more of her.,The Notebook

Not only does it portray the simple beauty of human relationships - it signifies something much more effortless, much more stunningly important.. the strength of the love we hold for eachother. The acting, storyline, and directing is perfect, there is not one flaw within this film. Of course not everyone will be moved by a romance film, however this is not to be categorised as a sappy chick flick. This is a movie which makes history in the television industry; sparks sadness, joy, and faith for love in everybody's hearts.

This is definitely not your average brainless chick flick, it is deep and powerful and meaningful. This is the kind of movie that you find yourself thinking about weeks later. It is not a movie that is just here for mere entertainment, that once you return to the video store, you won't even remember watching it.

It didn't seem like a kind of movie that I would watch since I'm more into the comedy and drama (yes the notebook is a drama but i didn't think it was back then I thought it was just a tear jerker) so i decided not to see it. More & more people at my school started talking about it and saying how awesome it was and how sad and how sweet, etc. I now wanted to see what the whole deal was, but I always forgot to pick it up at the movie store when I went. Then one day it was on TV and I was on a trip with my parents to New Zealand so we all watched it. This is now one of my favorite movies. It's so moving and sweet and although a little exaggerated at some parts, really real. It could actually happen and thats what makes it such a great movie.

I love this movie (book) because it not only shows Noah and Allie in love while they were young, but it also shows how strong and true there love is even as they are old. there love is so pure and beautiful that it grows stronger each day. And the most beautiful thing about this movie is the fact that Racheal McAdams and Ryan Gosling acted amazing. They really made you feel the connection between them which they did manage to pull into the real world. There couldn't have been better actors for these roles. i like the fact that this movie and story isn't just based of stupid high school, dumb teens in love. it takes place in the forties, and they fall in love,and even when they meet when they are adults...the lovethey shared that summer stayed with them, and they never stopped thetimeless love and passion they had between each other...not even when they were 80!. Another thing that i love about this movie is that neither one of them dies young.. instead...they love each other so much that age 80...despite allies disease, Noah reads to her everyday in hopes that just for a short period of time each day she would remember him...NOW THAT IS LOVE> and they die together in each others arms...and they had lived their life...whats better then that?",The Notebook
572,PernillaP,"a good story, well told",10,21 March 2006,"The Notebook seemed like a boring movie when I read the summary on the back of it, but after seeing it I must admit that the summary was the best lie ever told. The Notebook is a beautiful story of love and hope through the ages, and the contents of it peels of in different beautifully told layers until you understand the core of it, and then it turns so sad, so gruesome and so hopeless and spite of all this sadness the true story stands stronger and more powerful than before.The movie begins at a home for the elderly where an old man reads from a notebook to an old woman at the home. It's in present day, South Carolina and as the man tells the story we're taken back to the 40's in a fictional town of Seabrook where Noah meets Allie at a fair and he falls head over heels for her. They begin a journey of love and differences that ends quite abruptly at summer's end, but still lasts for years. The setting tells nothing of the political issues in the 40's US south but it's not supposed to either, I think. It's a story of love between two people from two very different backgrounds. The photography is amazing and the detail of the time and place is astounding, you do feel like you've been tossed 60 years back in time, but the real deal is the chemistry between Noah and Allie - that's what makes this move tick and is enhanced by James Garner's and Gena Rowlands's performances.Beautiful story, beautiful setting and extremely much worth seeing - over and over again. It makes an even greater impact the second time around when you have all the answers and new realizations appear.SPOILERS: . . . . When you watch the movie you realize after a while that the old man, Mr Calhoun really is Noah and the woman he's reading to is Allie who suffers from Alzheimers disease. That alone is heartbreaking. He has loved her all his life and is now retelling the story of themselves and she doesn't recognize it, she doesn't even recognize her own family that comes to visit them. The final blow that really tore through my heart is the realization that SHE wrote the notebook for Noah to read to her so that she might remember something Their story takes place in the run down mansion that Noah vowed to rebuild for Allie, as well. The movie makes me hope that there are men out there like Noah, with uncanny patience and perseverance to love another no matter what the circumstances. Another fine symbol is the birds in the movie. It begins with birds flying towards the house, they come back when Allie wants to be a bird in her next life to which Noah replies ""If you're a bird, I'm a bird."". He remembers this and later - when they meet again after seven years - takes her to a magical place to where swans and ducks come. Allie asks if the ducks stay there and Noah says no, they go back to where they came from - a semi-harsh analogy to Allie when she left that summer, long ago. Finally the birds return as the credits start to roll when we leave the mansion and a flock of geese take flight across the waters and reminds us of Allie's wish to become a bird in her next life.",The Notebook
573,elephantoats,"it's a schmaltzfest, but it's watchable",6,29 August 2007,"This movie is engaging, and the photography is pretty. Everyone seems to have liked it.. even dads. The period details are thorough, succeeding to conjure the atmosphere of a simpler, more romantic time. However, it is hard not to feel tricked when movies do this because of course life has always been complicated and dizzying, scarcely turning out to be as wonderful as it was dreamed. There is a shadowy area between what is actually romantic and what is romanticized to the point of artifice. The romanticizing in this movie can be excused somewhat because of the characters' states of being-- the story is mapped out in memories of people who desperately attempt to re-envision them, to savor the beauty of their relationship before time runs out. We all romanticize the past.But the spirit of the old man Noah to me seemed too jazzy. It's especially evident in his conversation with the nurses. In addition to his lines, maybe the casting could be blamed for this. The personalities of the old man Noah and young Noah were too divergent. People only transform so much over time, and the reticence of young Noah just seemed too much in place to produce such a lively old guy. Rachel McAdams is a pleasure to watch, even though her performance was rather unvaried, including much coquettish giggling on the other side of puffed-up fussiness. Gosling turned out to be less fun than he promised at first. Parts of the script were good, others unbearable.. the whole bird thing comes to mind.In the end, most of my complaints are simply a matter of taste, as with any review. I thought this movie could use a little criticism.",The Notebook

Nicholas Sparks writes one hell of a love story, and it couldn't have been brought to life better on the big screen than in this movie! Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams captured the love and angst of Noah and Allie perfectly. The story takes place in present day with James Garner reading to Gena Rowlands. He is narrating a story of love, and then we flip to 1940's and we see Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams portray a southern lumber worker and a well off city girl, who fall hopelessly and desperately in love with one another during an unforgettable summer.

Everyone involved in this movie deserves to be praised, especially the actors and directors and writers, because this movie was all that and bag of red hot cheetos. I LOVED IT!!

576,laura20,Doesn't live up to the hype...*Possible SPOILERS*,5,2 August 2004,"When I first saw the preview for this movie, I knew that I wanted to see it.I love sappy romances. First off, if you're gonna go see or rent the movie, don't read the book first. That was my big mistake. I read the book and it was fantastic. One of the best love stories and I've since recommended it to a lot of people. So naturally I'm hyped about seeing the movie. If the book is this good, the movie should be pretty good too, right?I guess I shouldn't compare the book with the movie, but it's hard not to. Almost all the actors in the movie were great, but I don't think they should have been in ""this"" movie, with the exception of James Garner and Gena Rowlands. They were superb in their roles. As for Ryan Gosling & Rachel McAdams, they really were not suited for the role. For pete's sake, Gosling and Garner looking nothing like each other and it was really hard to see them as the same character. Gena Rowlands and Rachel McAdams...I guess there's a similarity.The best parts of the movie were the scenes with Garner and Rowlands. They make the movie. They're both tremendous actors and I think this is some of Garner's best work.Overall, don't go to the movie expecting the book because you'll be disappointed. I was pretty ticked off at the ending. It's a pretty good date movie, but not much more than that.I've given it a 5/10 because I wasn't impressed and I left the movie thinking it wasn't that great and I should've waited until it was released on DVD.",The Notebook

I saw it at a sneak preview on June 12 and then I loved it so much that I went back to another sneak screening on the 22nd. Everything about this movie is wonderful.The movie is based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks. It's the story of a couple (Noah & Allie) who meet when they are teenagers and fall in love and have a summer romance. Different backgrounds tear them apart from each other but they never forget each other. Reunited after 8 years, they must decide if their love is still there or if Allie should go ahead and marry her fiancé, Lon. The story of the young lovers is being told by an older gentleman as he reads the story to Allie. Allie is suffering from Alzheimer's and Duke reads her the story to help her remember the love she had when she was younger.First off, the cinematography of this movie is simply breathtaking. Some of the scenery is just absolutely beautiful. The scene with all the swans (as you see in the trailer) is just amazing. It's so romantic and helps you feel the romance of the movie.Secondly, the music makes you feel the emotions. I now have the soundtrack and while I don't normally like soundtracks that are mostly ""scores"", I find myself reliving scenes in my head when I hear the music. It makes me remember how emotional the scene was - in part because of the emotional music.Then of course, I have to mention the acting. James Garner and Gena Rowlands were amazing. They bring such emotion to the characters. You really feel for them and you can feel the love that Duke (James Garner) has for Allie (Gena Rowlands). Then there is the young lovers portrayed by Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. Both of them are stars that we have not seen the last of yet. They were both amazing. The rest of the cast (Joan Allen, Sam Shepherd, James Marsden, and Kevin Connolly) were all outstanding support.This was a feel good movie. While there was conflict amongst the characters, there was also deep emotion and love there as well.10 stars! Go see this movie!",The Notebook
578,sherruss,Best romance movie ever!,10,6 June 2007,"Absolutely loved it! I couldn't get enough of it and will watch it every year at least once a year. It was SO romantic that the two actors who played the lead characters even got together off screen, that's how hot it was. It doesn't hurt that both Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling are incredibly physically attractive either.Honestly, if you haven't seen this film, I highly recommend it. Every time I watch it, my husband gets lucky. It's SOOOO GOOD! I've heard it's even better than the book, and that's rare when that happens. Definitely worth while, definitely will make you fall in-love all over again. Guaranteed you'll you want to watch it again and again.",The Notebook

The casting of Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams was brilliant. They made me want to be 17 again enjoying the emotions of first love. However, there are some aspects that drove me nuts. As much as I love James Garner he is obviously not what Noah would have looked like as an older man. To show pictures of a younger James Garner and Gena Rowlands to represent Noah and Ally was absurd. Who thought of that? It was like a different movie at that point. Some of the editing and script were inconsistent. When Noah asks Ally what she does for fun he says that 'I 'always' thought...he just met her....how could he 'always' think of her as anything? When Finn sees her in town the day after the carnival he says to Noah 'look isn't that the girl from the carnival'....he was the one who told Noah at the carnival that her name was Ally and her father had more money than God...why would he say 'that girl' when he knew her name? The battle scenes were totally irrelevant. Maybe I'm being picky but it was so good and could have been so much better.",The Notebook

I began crying the moment of their fight outside of Allie's parents' home and didn't stop for the entire duration of the film. It doesn't take much to make me cry, but this film stuck in my head long after I watched it. The actors were incredible, the storyline was magnificent and the lake scene was indescribably beautiful, touching, memorable and tear-jerking. For anyone whose thoughts on the young Allie were tarnished because she cheated on her fiancé, I think you're wrong. She and Noah truly loved one another and she made the right decision.The ending was heart breaking yet satisfying, and left me thinking of Noah and Allie's lives together that we weren't given an insight to- the births of their children, their time in the house...I am positive that this film will stay in my mind for years to come, possibly even until I become a bird in my next life...",The Notebook

It wasn't a sad ending but VERYYY emotional! I loved the acting of the two main characters. They played the parts perfectly and I can't wait to see these actors in the future. I hate to say it but I think this WAS a chick flick although I think many guys could enjoy this movie too. I also loved the guy who played Noah, he was so hot and intense!I hope everyone goes out and enjoys this movie and has a great time laughing and crying. I heard some people comparing their emotions to Titanic but I can never remember as many people grabbing tissues or wiping their eyes during that movie. Plus I didn't cry at all during Titanic but I was close to balling in this one and that is what makes this movie amazing.

It truly was touching, mostly for people who enjoy watching that type of genre. I can't think of any bad points about the film although when I began to watch it, I thought it would be dull and I was totally wrong in thinking that because now I feel it deserves more credit. I liked how the story was told, it was very different from the usual romance stories you get, but it made it even more better realising it was Noah telling Allie the story of their love life, love never dies!

From the opening scenes, you know you're witnessing breakout performances by Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams--the camera loves both, as they steal the lush, wistful, and often surreal scenes of youth from beginning to end. My companion and I were so moved by its impact that we could just look at each other in awe after leaving the theater, grateful that such beautiful films are made at all, however infrequently.

But for most, it is so authentic and real, you can almost feel the passion that Noah and Ally feel for their entire lives. I've seen this movie so many times, but the ending never fails to make me well up. Hard to find movies so emotionally charged and powerful nowadays, this movie is a timeless classic.",The Notebook

(Though, granted, if I I had had a mother like the Joan Allen character, I myself would probably be that messed up.) I think someone else said: this is an example of how NOT to have a relationship. It is not that I am so jaded, but ultimately I see the relationship between the two as troubling rather than beautiful.And even if it was ""just beautiful"", have we not seen it before? Isn't it kind of like The Titanic (minus the sinking ship) set in the deep south on the cusp of WWII? The actors were very good at playing people I would not care to know. If the acting were not so good, I would feel like I was watching an early 80s Pia Zadora movie or something, or at least a slightly forgettable 50s melodrama that shows up on TCM at 3am once in a while.Sorry if I offended. I don't mean to spoil other people's enjoyment, but I found myself actually upset with the way the film presented dysfunctionality as great love, without a hint of irony.SPOILER ALERT: James Garner looks nothing like Ryan Gosling.

The first time I watched it my boyfriend rented it as it was recommended by one of his friends. We both cried our souls out and he is a big man, I've never seen him cry before. Anyways, Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling did an amazing job, their chemistry in the movie is unbelievable. I was shocked when I read that they couldn't stand each other on set in real life. Watching the movie I thought they'd end up being together. I love this movie and I'd recommend it anytime. I noticed some reviews calling the movie 'cliché' 'unrealistic' ...it's based on a true story so I'm not sure what they meant. It's sad when people don't believe in love, my grandpa passed away 2 months after my grandma died and he was a healthy man so I did not find this movie to be cliché or unrealistic at all.

The only emotion in the movie (the awkward courtship/love scenes and Allie's annoying habit of squealing) are painful to watch.I only watched it to the end to make sure the two old fools died (everyone knew withing 15 minutes of the start what the situation was).Which makes it reminiscent of Titanic for me where I was hoping every minute after the first 60, that Leonardo DiCaprio would just die already.",The Notebook

I think that this film brings out feelings...feelings that some of us had and still have; feelings that some of us didn't have the chance to experience but they long for that kind of relationship.

The movie started telling a old man telling a love story to his wife and he hoped it could help her to recall some of her memories when they were young... An educated and rich girl fell in love with a poor guy and being separated with her parents...you can guess everything, but the director made this movie so beautiful and sad....Finally, the movie revealed that the notebook that writing the love story was actually written by his wife and she asked her husband to read it to him whenever she forgot him...The wife asked her husband if their love could make them die on the same day and they did die in the same day eventually...It's really touching and I think everyone should think more about finding your life spouse, you shouldn't marry simply a rich guy but someone who are truly in love with you!!

Rachel Mcadams is a great actress and well-cast, i have enjoyed all the movies she has been in. I especially enjoyed the fact that it was based in the 1930s/1940s.

Not really a guy's kinda film, The Yawnbook more like it. Dong la!However, in saying that. I have never managed to be more drawn into the middle of the movie. Katherine Hepburn who plays Audry, an autistic teenager portrays a dis-normal childhood into a slightly parodic type to which anyone can relate to. Michael Keaton who plays the childs father is heroic in the sense that he can hold a job as a lawyer while still managing to cure Audry's illness. The mother who is played by Kathlene Turner is anything but funny, a serious and mischievous woman who gains satisfaction, when she wins the lottery at a local RSL and learns that there can be happiness from money if one wishes for it hard enough. This romantic yet dramatic real life story can only be described as confusing yet relatable in it's self confusion of today's world and economy.The scenes are beautifully done in exotic Africa and Hungary, mostly from a small farm in Brazil, containing beautiful images of young and old and doctors who try to cure glandular fever.I would rate this movie to be one of the years top films, well done Hiroshi Wu for directing this film and to all the support from leading charities who contributed to this film from Hong Kong.",The Notebook
602,mathieu_scheffers,"a very beautiful, touching love story",9,13 October 2004,"It's one of most romantic movie ever to be seen. I cannot describe how wonderful this movie was. From the very beginning you are drawn into the movie. At first I thought the movie a little silly, but the longer the movie going on the more i was going to love it. Although the story of the book is at some point very different from the actual movie. But for me that's no problem. I've watched quite a lot of movies without reading the books where they're based upon. The story as you know is about Noah and Allie. When they meet each other, they're both around 17 years of age, it's almost love at first sight. After a summer of romantic love they have to split, because he is poor and she is rich. So Allie's parents believe it's a love that will never last. But fate decides otherwise. They'll meet each other again.Just before Allie's wedding with another rich man. And their love returns and in the end they both believe this love is meant to last forever.This story is told by the old Noah. He reads the story to a woman with Alzheimer disease. (Of course it turns out to be his wife)That part is beautifully played by James Garner and Gena Rowlands. This is one those movies couples will not easily forget. It's about your first love and never able to forget it. The performances of the leads are incredible. Especially the young pair, played by Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, are absolutely stunning. I've rarely seen so much chemistry between lead characters. The movie itself is beautifully shot, the music is wonderful. I read that many people cried throughout the movie, but i didn't(I never did by the way.) Crying no, deeply touched and tears not to far away yes. Of course the movie has some minor weaknesses.(All movies have, even the Lord of the Rings3,considered the best movie of all time) For one,the end is taking too long and the best part, the young couple, is missing in the last 15/20 minutes of the film. The other is the sometimes ridiculous lines the actors have to say. But that is hardly avoidable. Rate:9.5/10P.S. Don't listen to what critics have to say about this movie.They often do not like romantic movies. That's why I had to watch it with only 5 persons.

I finally saw it last night, and I completely fell in love with this love story! Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are particularly brilliant and have wonderful chemistry as a young couple in love. I couldn't believe how a romance could unfold in a way that it was watchable and could be related to. What most modern films miss is the ability to capture a relationship in a way that you become engrossed in it and wish that maybe, just maybe, it could happen to you-- The Notebook allows you to hold onto that notion. James Garner and Gena Rowlands also play their parts well (they reminded me of my grandparents), as endearing and emotional characters. Everyone in this film evokes so much and it makes it hard for any viewer not to add this film to their favorites list. Expect to tear a little bit, but be glad that you did.

This is just the kind of story that grabs you even if you feel yourself resisting it. It was also interesting to me because it's one of the few movies in a long time that my mom and could watch together, and I guess that's a good thing. She liked it more than I did and I think it made her think a lot about some things in her own life. I thought Rachel McAdams was really amazing -- there is something about her looks, the way her skin is so translucent, that you feel like you can really feel everything she feels and understand her character better than with other actors. Ryan Gosling was also good -- hot without trying to hard to be a ""hottie"". And James Garner -- what a cool old guy. My mom made me watch him in his ""Maverick"" days and I'm glad I did.

608,aimers_4,Never Give Up on the One You Love,9,14 July 2009,"""The Notebook"" is one of my favorite love stories of all time. In the beginning of the film there is this elderly couple who is living in the nursing home in different locations in the facility. The husband, Duke (James Garner), is living in a part of the nursing home where the nurses can keep an eye on him because he has problems with his heart, and the wife, Allie Calhoun (Gena Rowlands) is living in the Alzheimer's ward. Duke comes over to her room everyday and reads a little bit from the notebook that he wrote of their life together when they were younger, because Allie couldn't remember anything from their past. The director Nick Cassavetes delivers a message in ""The Notebook"" to never give up on the one you love. Cassavetes shows this when Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) and Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams) were young and in love, and they were pretty much forced to break up because her parents made her move. Then seven years later she realized that she was still in love with him after she seen the picture of the house in the paper that he promised to build, so she went back and they fell back in love. Nick Cassavetes also expressed that by showing how Noah never gave up on his Allie while she was struggling with dementia. Noah was doing everything that he could think of, for example, reading the notebook of their past, so she could possibly regain some of her memory that she had lost from the disease. ""The Notebook"" is the most romantic movie I have ever seen. The costumes that they wear in the movie were perfect and beautiful. When the couple breaks up because of her parents and her having to go away to college after the summer ends was heartbreaking. My favorite scene in the movie is when Noah and Allie went out on the pond, and there were dozens of geese on the pond, then it started to rain when they were on their way back to the house, and that was when they had realized that they still had strong feelings toward each other.",The Notebook

It is a film that really takes you back to the simplicities of life and draws you into the innocence of a young couple with little care of the world outside their romance. The scene at the plantation where the couple shyly remove their clothes is in fabulous contrast to the later scene in the film where they eventually make love for the first time with intense passion. The underlying current throughout the story of unfaltering belief in loves provides a charming back drop for the film. Love love LOVE this film!!",The Notebook

It tells a great story, with good actors, and great scenes. It can relate to everyone, because everyone knows, you just can't forget your first love (or your true love.)

After seeing her first loves picture in the paper standing in front of the house she always wanted she goes back. A rush of old feelings comes back and they reunite. She is forced to decide who she wants to be with in the end.While this story is being told by an old man to the woman he loves you see that this couple is them and he tries to make her remember who she is and that she now has a family with him.The whole movie is a roller coaster of emotions and being truly in love. I love the fact that this movie shows that if something is meant to be it will happen. I was disappointed that you didn't get to see them grow old together but you can just imagine how wonderful their life was.If I could compare this movie to another one it would be Made Of Honor. In this movie the guy reacts the same as the guy in The Notebook. He realizes his love for this girl who is about to marry someone else. He does everything he can think of just to win her back and show her they were meant for each other.",The Notebook

As did James Garner and Gena.I loved this movie's plot. Two young people meet and fall in love and then struggle because her parents think that he is not good enough for her,all set admist 1940's charleston. The Notebook is definitely a tear jerker. When i went to see it not only was i bawling but the whole theater was. And i think part of that has to do with the fact that you know that they love each other so much. And Ryan Gosling nad Rachel Mcadams do a great job portraying that love.The Notebook will make you laugh,it will make you cry,but most of all it will make you want to fall in love.",The Notebook
614,huckleberry200,Stunningly Emotional,10,24 October 2006,"Many movies or TV shows have made me cry because of the absolutely hear breaking scenes within them, but none whatsoever (in my opinion of those movies that i have seen) can even hold a candle to 'The Notebook'. When you realise the circumstances and truth behind why the old gentleman is reading to the old woman it breaks you heart. What we first see is an old man by the name of Duke who comes to the nursing home to read a story about two young lovers to an old lady. The story of the young lovers Noah & Annie itself is beautiful, passionate, tense and SO emotional and the characters of the young lovers are outstandingly played by Rachael McAdams and Ryan Gosling (who are a couple in real life now after meeting on the set of 'The Notebook' - i feel this makes the whole romance between them so much more believable and intense). It's the classic 'poor worker boy meets rich girl, they fall madly in love but it can't last' story, but is SO much more. It was heartbreaking to watch them have a massive argument because they thought that breaking up would be easier on them both and then realising they loved each other but they couldn't find each other in time before Annie left. Throughout the story we see Duke reading to the old lady and she tells him she thinks she remembers this story. Noah (Ryan's character) wrote to Annie (Rachael's character) every day for a year but never received a reply (it turned out that her mother kept all the letters)(to her mother)""You watched me cry myself to sleep for months and months and you never said anything. How could you do that?""For me, the moment that was most shocking and began the onslaught of tears that could have filled the Atlantic, was when we found out that Duke was actually Noah and the old lady was Annie. Annie developed senile dementia and doesn't remember Noah or her life with him (or their children), but all the while he reads to her the story of their life hoping that she will remember. It physically hurt when Annie remembered who she was and says to Noah; Annie: What happened to me? Noah: Nothing. You just went away for a little while. Annie: How much time do we have? Noah: I'm not sure. Last time it was no more than five minutes.The fact that he knew Annie would come back to him but they only have a matter of minutes till she will forget again was so emotional. The moment when they are dancing and without warning she suddenly asks ""why did you call me Darling? I don't know you"" and becomes panicked, the nurses rush in and Noah breaks down on the bed crying.The final scene when they are lying in bed together and she remembers who she is... my GOD i was having trouble breathing... it was such a powerful scene and i defy anyone not to cry at that final moment when we see the shot of the birds flying away.Noah sticks by Annie no matter what, even though she doesn't remember who she is he stays by her side. ""I'll be here. I'll never leave you"" and to me, this is why this story is the most epic love story i have ever seen.",The Notebook

It was beautifully done and the cast was excellent. The end was so unexpected as well... I was bawling like a baby... Rachel McAdams delivered a flawless performance as did Ryan Gosling..

The film starts off quite weird as there is two older characters and one is telling the other a story, we later learn who they are. Allie and Noah are two people, who come from very different backgrounds, when they first meet at the carnival, Noah sees something in Allie, Allie on the other hand doesn't want to be involved with a labouring man. After a while, they get to no each other and fall in love. But when Allie's parents become unpleased with the situation,they move away. Noah and Allie still love each other, but they were never meant to be. Noah writes Allie a letter, hoping she will write back, Allie never receives the letter, as her mother hides them from here, we later learn why this is. Noah doesn't give up, and sends Allie a letter everyday for a year. Allie, then meets a wealthy gentleman and soon she falls in love, and they plan to marry. Then one day, Allie sees a picture of Noah in the local paper, standing outside a house,of which he had built. Allie then visits Noah and things are unveiled. This brilliant film will change your view on love, and shows that you always find a way back to your true love in the end. I would totally recommend this film to anyone.",The Notebook

I didn't care for it, and when the movie came out, I tried to watch it, thinking it would be better than the book. I think I tried watching this movie twice, and it just did nothing for me. Good thing I rented this movie; it would've stunk if I bought it and weren't able to return it. Nicholas Sparks' novels have made better movies than this one. It just seemed so fairy tale to me; that doesn't happen in real life. I found it to be boring, and I didn't even watch the whole thing. Just couldn't; it seemed to drag like a boring class you have to take. Altho I read more of his books and loved them, this one was my least favorite.",The Notebook

I liked it so much that we had to see it again (not that it took much convincing).Funny thing.

621,ChandaACR,A few comments *spoilers may be included*,10,29 June 2004,"Okay, I've read almost all of the Nicholas Sparks books and this one was one of my favorites. I was very much looking forward to the movie and got a chance to see it finally with a few friends. This is an incredible love story and we can all hope to have a love like that in our own lives. I was a bit bothered by how much was altered from the book as some of it just didn't seem to flow as well as I'd hoped. Maybe I've forgotten, but I do not recall Allie being a nurse's aide in the book as she was in the movie. It was an interesting plot twist that introduced us to Lon, however. There were several other discrepancies, but this is one that greatly sticks out in my mind. The one that bothers me the MOST though is the ending. It totally ruined it for making the sequel book, The Wedding, into a movie as well since Noah and Allie both pass away in the end of the movie. It still moved me to tears along with the rest of the theater and I still recommend seeing it. I will advise you read the book first, though.",The Notebook
622,origami232000,Tissue please???,8,29 June 2004,"The only thing that disappointed me was the fact that I sobbed through this movie and didn't have a tissue! This movie was just lovely from the actors' performances to the romantic love story of two people, Allie and Noah. This movie is more of a drama and it shows the affects of age and disease with Gena Rowlands Alzheimer's. The story starts where a man (James Garner) visits a woman (Gena Rowlands) daily in a nursing home. There he reads her the beautiful story of two people Noah and Allie and how they fall in love. Troubled that their daughter will marry 'trash', Allies parents take her away from Noah after one summer of love. There lives continue and Allie falls in love with Lon Hammond (James Marsden) and gets engaged. When she sees Noah's picture in the paper, she goes to see him and they realize they are still in love with one another. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are perfect in the roles of the two young lovers. Usually their characters are much darker. (McAdams in Mean Girls and Gosling in Murder by Numbers) But they hit the spot perfectly. Gena Rowlands and James Garner were the true hit of the movie and the ending scene was done beautifully between them. At the end of this movie, there was not one dry eye in the entire theatre. The ending is sentimental and makes you think of your first love all over again. I recommend this movie to everyone...this is not a 'chick-flick.' It is a powerful drama that will make you think about who you want to spend your life with and what you wand out of life.",The Notebook

The story of Noah Calhoun and Allie Nelson is a story of true love that is torn apart by differences only to be rekindled after seven years of separation. This is the best romantic movie I have seen in quite some time. Period. If you do not cry even once throughout this movie, then you must not have a heart. I loved everything about this movie. It was poignant and sometimes funny and should not be missed. Ryan Gosling was excellent at portraying Young Noah Calhoun. He is a great actor and when I came out of the theater, I decided to buy the book. Go rent this movie. It will really make you think.",The Notebook
624,angela-reed-330-669181,Could have been better,6,4 April 2012,"The Notebook was designed to be another Nicholas Sparks tearjerker, but this movie was made great by the actors on screen, not the script. The storyline is amazingly predictable and most of the lines are cheesy. The special effects, are not so great either. However, I would recommend that anyone and everyone should see this movie for one reason: Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams together on screen. I have never in my life seen two people who had as much chemistry between them as this. What they posses together blew me away and made me glad that I paid to see this movie. The two connected extremely well and made me believe their love and why they would go through such a tragedy for it. On the negative side, Nicholas Sparks is not my favorite author, I did not enjoy ""A Walk to Remember"" for two reasons, Mandy Moore, and the predictable plot line which always appears in Nicholas Spark's novels. But, thankfully, I was able to overlook such blunders and see the core of the movie, Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams",The Notebook

I remember seeing Rachel McAdams in Mean Girls, and didn't think much of her, but she's actually quite talented! Great Movie and must see. I definitely went through a box of tissues. I cried throughout reading the book as well. Just absolutely touching! Of course the screenplay was a little different than the original, but I really thought it was amazingly done.

I was seriously mistaken, somewhat. I'd say it was aimed towards that audience but it wasn't the usual crappy chick flick. It's based on two people who fall in love as teenagers (17), and it is real love. They are then to overcome obstacles such as separation and war and so forth. What's really original though is that it's told by an elderly Noah (Ryan Gosling) from a notebook to an old lady who has Alzheimer's. The whole thing is beautifully acted and the two lead roles really work well together. It gets you involved and sucks you into the story. It was shot very artistically and well. Overall I was just amazed and came out thinking it was an awesome movie. Don't let the genre fool you, this is really an excellent romance movie, rare for our times now. Best movie so far this summer, I give it a 10.By the way, I'm a guy. This movies not just for women.",The Notebook

This is more than a simple love story, it's good on so many levels. I don't want to give anything away, just go see it, enjoy your time well spent, and prepare to cry. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are my absolute favorite actors now, their performances were so great, and their chemistry was excellent, and really, the audience just falls in love with them both. This story will really touch everyone who's had a first love. Ten years after I fell in love at first sight with my first love, we're now getting married, so maybe this movie touched a deep chord in me. Women, coerce your boyfriends/husbands to join you at this movie, they will enjoy it as well, I haven't met a guy yet who hasn't.

630,hoof_hearted,In defense of this movie from a cynic..,10,18 July 2004,"This movie is sappy, unoriginal, contrived and completely wonderful! I loved this movie, although it pains me to admit it because I normally do not like love story movies (or anything associated with N.Sparks)- I find them unbearably long and dull (and usually can't sit through the whole thing) simply because the only thing going on around them at all times is their all-consuming romantic trials, which get old fast. Somehow though, it works in this movie. Perhaps it is because the leads seem to have a nice chemistry together (the younger and elder) and inspire empathy for their characters. It seemed to have an element of relevance for an older generation (the theater I went to had many older women and I overheard one pair talking about how they remembered when ""I'll be seeing you"" was popular when they were teenagers) showcasing the young lovers to the dealing-with-age elderly couple. Was it obvious? Of course. Does it matter? Not this time. Although normally I'm very cynical, this movie seduced me, I knew I was being taken for a ride, and I enjoyed it. It romanticizes a time when people who were in love were expected to be it for the long haul, end of story. In reality, things in the past were not any more perfect than they are today, but it still is a nice fantasy. Deep down I think we all wish we could find romantic passionate love with someone (our first love no less!) and spend the rest of our lives still enamored with this person. The chances of all of the above happening are not usually very high, so that is where stories/movies like this come in. Although I've read one Nicholas Sparks book and felt sick that I had wasted 2 hours of my life, I'm glad this movie was made. The movie did get a little over the top at the end, there were a few points I thought it could have just ended at. Even so, the costume design might have been worth the ticket price alone. I walked out wanting to be in love and have some killer shoes. Now that is a good movie!Overall this movie is ** out of ***** on a normal movie scale, but for a romance movie ***** out of *****.",The Notebook

It is so beautiful and captivating! From the moment the movie begins, it sucks you right in. You grow close to the characters- which I think is important in a movie. You relate to them; you cry when they cry, and laugh when they laugh! The cast is awesome and perfect! I would highly recommend this to anyone!

I saw this film at a sneak preview, with a packed theater full of people of all ages, and it was obviously enjoyed by all. Bravo!

She has the right stuff to be THE starlet of the next decade...you heard it here. If she doesn't get an Oscar nomination for her performance, I will be very put out.I also enjoyed the performances of Gosling, Garner, Shepard and Rowlands. You are totally taken in by all of these characters, and find yourself thinking later about filling your life up with people of their quality. This is definitely now one of my all-time favorite love stories. This movie definitely has a Capra-esque quality to it, that lingers with you.",The Notebook
635,pkatzzz,This movie was vapid and trite,2,9 April 2005,"Sorry, folks, but I'm getting the impression that the people on here who just loved this movie are a bunch of 16 year old girls who haven't a clue as to what makes a good movie - they just see this ""really cute guy"" on the screen and it's instantly SO romantic!!!First of all, I really do love romantic movies - but well made ones. I like ones where the acting is good, the writing is not trite and amateurish, the characters are believable and likable. I like the kind of romantic movies where I actually CARE what happens to the lovers. I could not have cared less about Noah and whatever the chick's name was (i saw it last night, and i've already forgotten her name). I thought the actor who played him was hideous - he mumbled his words and basically just walked through the part. The girl was irritating as hell. I just did not see or feel ANY chemistry between them - I couldn't see what she saw in him and I certainly couldn't see what he saw in her, her personality drove me nuts. and I kept wondering - what did Noah actually do for a living to support himself as an adult? I mean, you can't renovate a house like that for FREE - and you certainly can't make a living by renovating your own house all day. So many things didn't make sense or were so unbelievable to me:1. Why did Noah keep showing his house, then when he had the opportunity to sell it, he kept turning the buyers down? Either decide to sell it or not, but wishy washy behavior was weak. 2. Sorry, I'm 45 years old and I have NEVER seen or known a man to pine away for years over some girl he met when he was 17 years old to the point where he becomes a drunk and has passionless relationships with other terrific women (as did Noah with the very beautiful and sweet widow, who frankly seemed to have more substance to her than his ditzy old girlfriend). I mean, REAL men move on... 3. Speaking of moving on, it didn't seem real hard for the girl (still can't remember her name) to move on to another man. And why not? He was smart, sweet, successful, mature, thoughtful, hardworking, loving, handsome - everything mature women really want. But no, the girl really wanted some apparently unemployed, immature kid with a constant hang-dog expression on his face. I mean, come on, this revealed to me that the girl was extremely immature ""i love you..but I love him too!!!"" Perhaps they deserved each other after all! 4. OK, we're supposed to believe that the mother was STILL crying over some day laborer guy she broke up with 25 years earlier to marry a rich, handsome, nice man? Oh, please. Were we REALLY supposed to feel sorry for her as she boo-hood into her hankie saying ""boo hoo, I keep wondering what would've happened if I had married him instead of your father. Boo hoo"". You wanna know what would've happened if she HAD married the day laborer? She would've have been BITCHIN in the trailer park to her husband, ""you lazy, drunk A$$hole! I coulda married a rich man, but No, I had to let my ""heart"" lead me and now I'm poor and married to a filthy day laborer!!"" Most likely, she wouldn't have had the fancy car to even drive by the mansion where the rich man she ""coulda married"" lived! Nor would she have had the well-dressed, Sarah Lawrence-educated daughter with her to boo hoo to.5. Hmmm, by my calculation, her daughter was 25 years old when her mother drove her to see the laborer at work...I kept expecting to FINALLY see a twist, a surprise in the movie. I thought the mother was going to confess that the day laborer was really her daughter's father!! But no, the writer decided to have EVERY aspect of this movie 100% predictable.I can't waste anymore time for this movie - I couldn't believe how predictable it was (hell, I figured it out while reading the DVD description!), how i didn't care about any of the characters, how trite the dialog was, a la ""Do you think our love can make miracles happen?"", how bad the acting was...Hey, I'm a softy as much as the next woman - movies like Casablanca, My Dog Skip, The Enchanted Cottage, Big Fish, Mr. Hollands Opus make me cry and cry.

He is very good in this movie, it's a daring role for him to play, especially after ""Murder by Numbers"" (a completely opposite character than Noah). I honestly didn't think I could see him playing the romantic type! He is a very versatile actor with great talent. My favorite parts were definitely when they danced together in the road and when he tells her that he wrote to her every day (in the rain).

638,laurinn,An amazing story brought to life beautifully on screen!,10,13 July 2004,"I cannot say enough about this movie. At a time where so many people are looking to see a film that lets their imagination take them away from reality, and venture into a fantasy world of super heroes and villains, this has really stepped in and exemplified the beauty of something so simple yet so complicated as love. I have never seen a romantic film that has had the ability to portray such feelings and emotions as this has. It's got it all; comedy, romance, and tragedy. Sure there aren't scenes of extreme violence, nor are there any amazing special effects. Though this does not fit into what seems to be the ever growing popularity of Sci-Fi, violent, suspenseful, or slap stick comedy movies out right now... it does find a place in people's hearts. I believe that while some may consider this to be ""just another cheesy romance"", it slips past that cliché' and brings forth realism. The bottom line of this movie is that you do struggle with love, it isn't easy but it does exist. You live, you love, you die. Everyone has a different story... and in this one the characters found true love in one another, had conflicts, and in the end their commitment was everlasting. There should be more movies out there that make you feel as good as this one does. This film can inspire you if you let it... and I suggest that you do.",The Notebook
639,treen-t,The Notebook-Oscar Worthy!,10,14 July 2004,"The Notebook was the best movie I have seen in a long time. I'm extremely proud of Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling's performances, both being from London, Ontario, Canada, which is not far from where I live. I'm sure after The Notebook we will be seeing these two great actors in the future. It was a movie that makes you laugh, cry and think about the people you love in your life. It also sends a message to follow your heart in life not what others want from you. I would go see this movie again and I know I will be purchasing it someday to add to my movie collection. The cinematography was also a delight. The movie score was beautiful and powerful. This was the best entertainment for my dollar so far this summer. I hope to see some Oscar nominations for The Notebook, Best Picture for me so far in 2004.Trina",The Notebook
640,okate,Beautiful love story!,10,20 July 2004,"This is most definitely the greatest movie I've seen all year. Rachel McAdams is my new favorite actress! She was incredible as Allie and I couldn't imagine anyone else playing that role more convincingly than her. Ryan Gosling was almost perfect for the role of Noah. The only thing I didn't like about him was his hot temper in the movie as opposed to the calm character in the novel. But I guess it did make for more dramatic scenes in the movie than they would have been if the book had been followed exactly. All of the characters were just like I had imagined them when I read the book. The book was, of course, much better than the movie, but that is always the case when a novel is made into a film. Nicholas Sparks is a genius; he really knows how to tug at your heartstrings! Everything in the story was fabulously romantic and deeply touching. The Notebook was truly remarkable and I will most definitely be purchasing it the minute it's out on video!",The Notebook
641,patti4jr,What True Love Should Be Like,10,14 September 2004,"This movie is the best love story I have ever watched. The characters were all wonderful, and the two newcomers done their jobs well. Noah and Ally---They fell in love very young, yet it was a love that nothing could stop or erase. The way the story goes, and the notebook being read, gosh, I can't even put into words how excellent this movie was!!!!! It was wonderful. There wasn't any major nudity, it was very clean the scenes you do see. But they way the scenes were directed, well, for all you women out there that love good love scenes, you WILL NOT be disappointed, that's for sure. It's the things that are not only in action, but the actual words that they say. Whew. This movie was rated PG 13, and there isn't much cursing in it as well. But personally, I wouldn't let anyone under 16 see it, because of the love scenes. This movie is spectacular. A+++++++++++. Anyone that hasn't seen it, PLEASE see it. Not just a chick flick. Great for a couple to watch together. Awesome, just awesome.",The Notebook
642,AshzHottie02,Love hurts,10,11 September 2004,"The Notebook is the best movie I have seen in a very long time! I love the story, the actors, the scenery...everything. I have NEVER cried when I watched a movie and this one made me cry like a baby in the theater. Which was very emberassing if you ask me. But anyway, The Notebook is the most touching love story I have ever seen. Not to mention Ryan Gosling is 2 die for hot! I can't wait until the movie comes out on video. Which it will be out next month, so go out and buy it because it's such a great movie. Even if you don't see the movie, read the book. The book is just as good but provides a lot more detail into the storyline. And honestly, I don't think the book is as sad.",The Notebook
643,onlytoni,It was very moving especially if you are married & love....,10,19 September 2004,It is a very romantic movie and will remind you about when you first fell in love and what you would do to have that love in your life forever. Me and my husband saw it...he loved it probably more than I did...if that is possible. He's a man in every way...a carpenter by trade. I heard him tell others they have to go see it!! You are guaranteed to at least get misty eyed..or have a good cry or two. If not then you are not breathing! I give it thumbs up as well as my hubby! Waiting for it to come out on video and add it to our collection! I would not show it to children under age 12 at least...but I took my children to see it and they weren't upset by it or in shock of seeing sexual scenes. However I probably wouldn't have taken my 10 yr. old had I known beforehand that it went as far as it did. On the other hand...she really loved the movie as did her sister. We also found a lot to laugh at in the movie. Take your parents to see it too...they will love it as well.,The Notebook
644,Cheertg,A movie well done,10,12 February 2005,I just got this movie on DVD and finished watching it. It was a very good movie that I really enjoyed watching. It for sure goes on to my favorite movie list. I would recommend it to anyone. It is a movie that contains laughter and tears. My grandma watched it with me and she also enjoyed it. This movie will touch the hearts of a lot of people and it is a family film worth buying.The actors do a great job making the story come alive. They are able to pull you right into what is happening and you feel as if you become a part of the story yourself. The movie takes you back into time and the beautiful scenes and lay out of the movie is very realistic.I think this could be a great family film and I can hardly wait until my mom and uncle can see this film.,The Notebook
645,mrvegas61,Worth watching.,8,17 July 2005,"Keep the Kleenex nearby. I didn't know Gena Rowlands and James Garner starred in this until it came on Starz on Sunday afternoon. I love these guys. Some one I know who saw this, told me that if they were talking to anyone but me, they would have called it a chick flick, but that he still thought it was a good movie. I think the story is superb and the acting as well. Sets and costumes great for the 40's scenes. Definitely worth watching once, unless you like to cry. Two of the best tear jerkers are ""Schindlers List"" and ""What Dreams May Come"". Own both DVD's, but hardly watch them. You have to be in a special kind of mood to watch an extremely emotional movie.",The Notebook
646,LadyDi2U,Emotionally Gripping,10,14 January 2006,"Between 'Terms of Endearment' and 'Fried Green Tomatoes', I am not sure where this fits amongst the two as in how emotionally gripping this film is. Young love progressing over a period of time but yet being told by one of the loves is an old thing in movies. It it what the actors/characters do to the art that brings it much more life. How we all wish for a love that grows into forever and beyond. Too bad it took me so long to see it but am I ever glad I did. Keep the tissues nearby because it's a tear jerker for sure. I definitely want to own this movie because it is a collector's item that reminds me of how much more beautiful life there is out there that I have yet to experience.",The Notebook
647,Dav620,Check It Out....,10,9 October 2005,"Surprised at how engulfed I became in this movie. While I am not inclined towards such movies occasionally why not? I think as of to date I have watched 8 or so many times now, beautiful yet classic movie. That's what was nice, although not to cliché's in a cheesy way, it was a beautiful story that was well worth watching through without a moment of boredom. Though I understand the need for the parts with James Garner and Gena Rowlands as it relates to the movie, it would have been better if it were scaled back towards the last portion of the movie. I think it would've served better I think for the climax of the film, but that's my opinion. As a guy I was blown away at how this movie hooked me in and kept me till the end when this isn't my preferred theme solely in a movie. The lead actors/characters were brilliant simply brilliant. Both of these young actors impressed me greatly although I had seen Ryan Gosling in ""Murder by Numbers"" and was impressed by him in that, though he was playing a completely different character, his intensity was equally stirring and memorable if not more so in this film. Rachel McAdams was captivating, I loved her portrayal of this character. Her feistiness was amazing, great job, but equally more important was her ability to portray this time period as woman was beautiful and very believable. Her intellect, as well as being tied into the upper crust of society was portrayed well especially in the middle parts of the movie, yet to commit herself into this wonderful relationship, that was all about the love and how it never left her was portrayed in the most authentic way, simply beautiful. Where else to go I don't know other then to say wonderful story, great actors, beautiful movie, and seeing is believing. This movie is in my top 10 all time films to date, and the best film I've seen in a long time, so check it out....",The Notebook

Well I didn't get to watch this movie on the theathre,that's because there wasn't a fuss about it in my country,but the plain old me a movie geek I heard a lot of good review about this movie mainly from the girls! I couldn't resist it so I watched it on Netflix and the next the thing you know it was an addiction I actually watched it for over 10 times already ! The story might sound cliché but the acting of Noah (Ryan gosling) and Allie (rachel mc Adams) was truly incredible,it was like watching them deeply in love! The best part of the movies is the quote *i wrote you 365 letters every day* well who could possibly forget that! I don't have to write out the plot because I'm guessing it's must be pretty much obvious to everyone by know!The ending was done spectacularly which was very heartbreaking so have a tissue on hand with u! To sum it up what can I say there wasn't a bad thing about this movie everything was rather PERFECT ! I suggest anyone into love movies definitely to watch this, it won't disappoint you!",The Notebook
649,cindyjmd,I absolutely loved this movie,10,15 February 2005,"If you like a movie with a ""story being told"" or a narration, you will love this. Is similar, in that sense, to Fried Green Tomatoes or Big Fish. People make it out to be a tear jerker romance...well, I am one to love those types of movies, but even my husband liked this one. I have been recommending this movie to everyone I talk to. Go rent it, better yet...buy it. I did. Ryan Gosling makes you fall in love with him, Rachel McAdams is beautiful, James Garner is a sweetheart, and Gena Rowlands does an excellent job acting her part. My daughter recognized Rachel from her role in Mean Girls right away. Ryan is definitely an actor to watch for.",The Notebook
650,Jen1356,Incredible!,10,22 December 2004,"When my roommate and I first arrived at the theatres to see The Notebook, the people coming out of the theatre who had seen the movie before us were all wiping their eyes. This movie is a real tear jerker, so you have been warned. It is the story of 2 young adults who meet at a carnival: Noah, a poor boy who works at the Lumber yard, and Allie, a rich girl who is on summer vacation with her family in Seabrook. All summer long, the 2 are inseparable. But Allie's parents don't approve of Noah (because he does not come from money) and forbid her to see him again. This complicates things between the two, and soon Allie is leaving Seabrook to go back to Charleston. Noah writes to Allie everyday for a year. 7 years later, Allie meets and falls in love with a handsome soldier named Lon, and soon he asks to marry her. During their engagement, Allie notices that in the paper on the same page as her wedding announcement is a picture of Noah standing near a house he rebuilt for her. She then must go back to Seabrook to see him before marrying Lon, and is flooded with old feelings for Noah. Allie is then forced to choose between the man that was her first love, and the man that her parents want her to marry.",The Notebook
651,CovDuo,This film was a surprise!,8,26 December 2004,"I saw this film while on a flight from Paris to Los Angeles. I was a bit upset because our plane did not have the small screens with the individual movie choices on it. There was only one movie choice per cabin ""if you want another movie, get on another plane."" Reluctantly (in rebel mode), I started watching it without having the headphones on. Believe it or not, even in silence, the film won me over. I was quickly drawn into it and soon could not stop watching it! Not long after my initial resistance, I put on the headphones. The only negative was the embarrassment I felt for sitting there sobbing on the plane as it is a very moving story. The characters came across with authenticity and were compelling. I also felt the way the film went back and forth between past and present got the message across effectively. At first I did not realise there was a connection between the two characters and as the connection starts to become evident, you become more drawn into their story. I highly recommend it as a movie I would definitely choose to see even if one is not a 'captive audience'.",The Notebook
652,Brippa,Main Overview of The Notebook,9,22 February 2005,"The Notebook is a wonderful romantic movie set Southern U.S.A in the 1940's during World War 2. Allie is a seventeen year old wealthy, snobbish girl living in New York with strict parents allowing her to only date rich young men. Noah is a 19 year old poor,romantic man who is architecturally gifted, living with his father in an old house. When Allie visits the town where Noah lives for the summer, they miraculously fall in love but are torn away by Allie's selfish parents. After Allie returns home, she meets another boy who she might be falling on love with too. But Noah can't stop thinking about Allie even while fighting in the war. When it all comes down to it, Allie must choose between her first love and her new flame. I highly recommend everyone see this movie. It is beautiful and proves our true love is really out there somewhere.",The Notebook
653,unique1harmony,Great Heart Touching Movie,10,16 January 2005,This movie is well worth to see! It's been a very long time since an excellent movie has come out about innocent love that really touches the heart.It's one of the rare one's you'll find like A Summer Story(1988) starring Imogen Stubbs and James Wilby. The Notebook will definitely take your heart away if you are one who understands and feel the emotions of one's dedicated heart warming true love.I thought I would never once again come across another wonderful movie about love and innocence that's just simply a heart touching love story. However The Notebook was a movie well done that covered everything a love story would make complete. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams played their characters extremely well. They both matched up perfectly in the movie. It wasn't one where the lady was too beautiful and the man just simply had to be replaced by a more handsome bold looking man or the other way around.This is definitely a must see if you are simply looking for a touching unforgettable love story. I plan on reading the book next since the movie was so great! It's usually agreed that the book version of any movie is usually (but not always) better.,The Notebook
654,drosner,Please bring you tissues!,5,10 February 2005,"The last time I cried this much was when I saw ""Steel Magnolias"". I am not one for depressing movies but my 17 year old saw this and said it was the best she had seen. I think she liked the love story part. James Garner is great as Noah and Gena Rowlands as an older Allie and the love story of how they met was very deep. Rachel McAdams is an absolute knock out and was fantastic in her portrayal of young Allie. Fortunately I never read the book and people I have talked to said you cry more when you read the book, so I guess I was fortunate. Alzheimer's is a wicked disease that tricks the mind and as much as I have heard about it, it wasn't until I watched this movie that I began to see how awful it really is. So as much as I liked some of this movie such as the love story, I really hated the ending.",The Notebook
655,Agapagirl,The greatest love troy you will ever see.,10,6 February 2005,"This is the best love story I have ever seen. This is one of those movies that come only once, while you are still young, but yet impacts the way you view love, passion, romance, and just the part of, love can conquers anything. The Director did a wonderful job of not taking out too much of the book, but the parts he did change where perfect. Hey did you know this book based on a true story. If you are in the mood for a tear jerker, this is the one. You will cry in laughing, you cry because of the love that these two characters had for each other, and will cry ......, well I won't say too much. Don't wanna give too much of the movie away. Abyways, these movie has officially become my most favorite movie of all time. The scenery in this movie is also breath-takingly beautiful.",The Notebook
656,hlej,Too overrated.,5,30 August 2013,"I was waiting until I had read the book to watch this film. I have heard nothing but good comments on this movie and after I watched it I was disappointed, although it is a good film it is too highly overrated. It didn't meet the standards that I had been expecting. I don't think it stood out particularly among other romantic films. Even still it was an enjoyable watch but the book, as usual is better. However, for someone who hasn't read the book i'm sure it would be classified as a good movie The plot and details make the book wonderful and highly enjoyable and the romance written by Nicholas Sparks was well captured on the screen, with the skill of two of my favorite actors.",The Notebook
657,psychoticrainbowbrite,amazing and quite a tearjerker,10,10 April 2005,"this is by far the most romantic movie i have ever seen. the love and faith in this movie is amazing. this tearjerker is the perfect movie for a romantic night with your significant other, or a girls night in (just make sure to have plenty of tissues nearby). the love between noah and allie is unmistakable and undeniable. ""the notebook"" makes you laugh, cry, smile, and think about life and all that is worthwhile. it makes you wonder and hope about that person out there in the world that you will fall head over heels in love with - and only wish that your love is half as strong as the love of noah and allie. this romantic drama isn't just a chick flick - it's a movie for all genders and ages. anyone can appreciate this movie. this is a definite a must see!",The Notebook
658,rwmail-811-964965,Rachel McAdams - a sensational performance,9,14 October 2013,I just watched this movie again for the second time and watched it from a more technical point of view. I am not a big fan of romantic movies. I am however a fan of very good acting and I would have to put Rachel McAdams performance in this movie in my top ten. I am surprised she was not nominated for more awards for this roll but I suppose chick flicks are not really taken all that seriously in the big leagues. It seems like a role that would require some very delicate balance to get it right. My thought is she got it just right. Over all I think she makes this movie - her costar Ryan Gosling I know has also gotten some acclaim for his performance but it was just good IMHO not sensational as was McAdams performance.,The Notebook
659,punk_rawk_princez,Just beautiful!,10,3 February 2005,"This amazing love story can be enjoyed by all. The Notebook is not one of those cheesy chick flicks that often come out, it is a brilliantly written intriguing story about two young lovers that most people can relate to.Even most males will agree that this movie pulls at your heart strings. Filled with fabulous quotes, and sentimental moments I found this movie to be one of the best I've seen. I got to know both main characters and found myself relating to each of them. Most of us remember our first love and that strong connection we had with them. This movie makes us think of what could have been and gives us a fresh look at the meaning of true love. I recommend this movie to anyone with a heart.",The Notebook
660,jeyurita,The film won't let you down!,9,22 April 2005,"When I borrow this film from Bluckbuster, it seems that no one touches that one and there is a lot VCD and DVD on the shelf, so I started wondering if the film is good or not because I was so expected when I saw the trailer on TV. After I finished to the end, I just cannot help moving by the great love conveying from the movie. I don't want it to end. The most touching part in this film is that at first we expected as original plot of poor boy and rich girl but also it contains the description of oldness and death, that is so real/cruel in our life. As people getting old, does the love exist; can we still keep strong and believe what we do is meaningful? If you like the movie, there is another one you have to see named 'a walk to remember' also wrote by Nicholas Spark and also it is highly recommended by Taiwan college students.",The Notebook
661,HaniaLee,Suprsing,10,6 October 2005,"When I saw the preview for this, I thought ""Another cheesy, shallow romance"" but guess what? It wasn't. Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling have chemistry, charm and talent to boot. Although the plot is overused, it translates on screen as a pure original. To repeat what other comments said, the scenery is beautiful beyond belief and it fits perfectly with the story. The young Noah and Allie made the film exciting and easy on the eyes. However,the older versions of Noah and Allie(played wonderfully by James Garner and Gena Rowlands) make the movie into a true LOVE story and pulls the tears out of your eyes. Any film about a love story I ever saw before always gave me a thirst for more. The Notebook is the first and only that ever satisfied me.",The Notebook

664,Fahrenheit2710,I'll just tell you that you're gonna cry.,10,26 March 2014,"I have to say I'm usually not so fond of movies about of this sort, so when I decided to watch this one I'd had many prejudices already, but I also have to say I took everything back as soon as I started to sob like crazy at the end. Before watching it, I read the Nicholas Sparks' novel, which I couldn't enjoy at all. Too short periods, way too many breaths to take between a sentence and another. I don't like his style at all, and this is the only movie based on his works I've watched so far, but in all honesty it is worth watching. We are introduced by a blood-red view of a lake where someone is rowing a boat in the distance. In the background a nostalgic music plays as a flock of birds flies over and we see an old woman looking at this scene from a window. We soon get to know that she suffers from Alzheimer and she can't even remember her name anymore. Also, we get to know that a cheerful old man, Duke, reads for her every day, something that she can't remember as well. They are both taken care by the staff of a nursing home. The two of them spend their time together in the beautiful locations of such structure reading the story about two young people who fell in love in the summer of 1940 in Seabrook Island, South Carolina. Those two are Noah and Allie, a country boy and a very wealthy heiress from Charleston. If you decide to give a chance to this movie, you'll see how they fell in love despite of their social gape and how they will (obviously) get separated because of her parents, who consider their a mere summer love which can only bring trouble. Also, you will see how they got back together after seven years, after the war and other events had taken place. The last thing I'll tell you, is that Noah and Allie are indeed Duke and his fellow patient, who will decide to do something extremely beautiful and heartbreaking at the end. I'm honestly too lazy to spoil everything, because I'm not that interested to do so, even if what I just wrote might sound like the description of one of the cheapest dramas ever. I assure you it's not like that at all, and I assure you you're going to cry at the end, maybe not for half an hour straight as I always do. Maybe yes, who knows. At this point, I don't even know what to write anymore. I just love how beautiful, touching, gentle and sincere such a story is told. I can relate on a ridiculously high level to the hardships Noah and Allie went through, and this may be the real reason why I rated this movie as ""excellent"", which at some point is not even enough in my opinion. The couple during its last last act is pictured with simplicity, flawlessly: James Garner and Gena Rowlands are perfect, credible. They don't need to enrich their performances with any useless effort, they portray two people their same age with affection, letting us feel the love that have bounded them together for so many years. Same goes for Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams and the great work they did as the same couple, as young Noah and Allie who met during that summer that changed their life forever. We don't just watch them as they simply kiss and have fun: she slaps and hits him when they have a fight, they yell at each other, he tells her she's a pain in the ass most of the time. They cry, they experience what a breakup feels like, they try to move on and never forget about each other and they finally decide to spend their lives together despite of all the regrets they might have in the future. And then they will write the final lines of that book together, as they have always been. What we learn from The Notebook, is the all-time-classic fact that ""true love never dies"". Yes, that's it. It's not like there's any other deep meaning in this story, there is nothing else apart from that one simple quote that can summarize it in a better way. But there is something else underneath, a warmth, an assurance, a light caress that whispers us not to be sad in the end. It tells us to fight, to be strong and have some good determination and stubbornness to get what we really want, to keep loving even if in doing so we may encounter every toughest difficulty. I'm still uncomfortable with the rate I gave to this movie because there are few details that don't convince me, situations that may give false hope in real life because you can only talk about miracles in those moments, but every time I try to hold back my tears in front of the bright screen, any doubt just goes straight to hell. I'd suggest everyone to watch The Notebook. Those who have always loved to see how such stories can be portrayed will definitely fall for this one and I bet that even the most skeptical will reconsider their opinion about the genre. Again, I'm wondering if I should ponder my judgement a bit more and go for a 9 instead of a 10. This really makes me feel uneasy, but then the last scene flashes in front of my eyes and an affectionate ""oh shut the hell up"" from my inner self echoes in my head.",The Notebook

666,soulmaned21,Not like the book at all.......,1,29 March 2005,"If you have read the book, then you will see how much this movie is unlike the book in every aspect. I'm sure the movie would have been better had I not read the book. I know movies are different from their books, but this simple yet amazingly romantic story was lost in this movie that makes it seem like everything happened because of the girl's parents. The typical 80's love story involving parents against their daughter's lover is not what this story is about. If you want real romance and want a story to really relate to, read the novel. The movie leaves out important things such as the letters that Noah and Allie wrote to each other as her condition was progressively getting worse. I watched the movie with my girlfriend and after wards I read her the letters from the book and that made her cry more than the movie's ending which in a way kills the story. How can you make a movie based on a hit-selling novel and COMPLETELY change everything. This movie is more like Bridges of Madison County 2: The Search For a Good Romantic Movie. If you want a romantic movie, rent Bridges of Madison County. If you want to read a romantic novel, read The Notebook, don't settle for the movie.",The Notebook

So I went to the closest Blockbuster and rented it on DVD. I watched it and it had me crying for many minutes after i watched it. It was incredible. I have never seen a better movie.

The love story of the two couples, Noah and Allie, was incredibly heart melting. I must say, for all us girls out there that have long term relationships with a guy,can most definitely relate. I know i did. The way Allie and Noah fought and acted made me laugh and totally reminded me of me and my boyfriend.

The ending made me cry and it takes a lot for that to happen. You really can feel for this movie if you have been in love. Especially in young love. Following your heart can be hard at time, and this movie shows the truth behind that. It was the type of movie that I didn't want to end. When it did, I thought that it was very touching. It is a movie of continuous power. It has ups and downs and when it finally ends, it ends well. I would recommend this movie to everyone that has a love for love stories.

Drama..Romance..a little bit of subtle comedy..I felt like I was part of the movie..I felt like I could be watching a movie about me! I figured right from the start that the old couple were probably the young children in the story. The movie outline was very interesting. I've never seen a well played movie within a movie.Some part that agitated me was when the movie was getting good but then they would cut back to present day! I mean that was the point of the movie to keep it suspenseful like but here I am crying my eyes out wanting to find out more!! I was very disturbed with Allie, as an older women, having that memory problem because that just isn't how I would picture a love story. Felt really bad for her husband but give him props for still loving and wanting to be with her.I was very surprised seeing Rachel McAdams playing Allie after seeing her in previous teen movies ""Hot Chick"" and ""Mean girls"", but her acting in this movie was pretty phenomenal. And Ryan Gosling...very good looking actor who played his character well.I think, though, that they caught Allie's and Noah's stories short towards the ending.

I love how they would fight one minute and hug, kiss and make up the next. And then I love how she saw him in the paper and decided to go see him it shows that fate and destiny still exists.

This movie shows you how hard it is to forget about your first love and always find a way back to them. Ryan Gosling, who played Noah, made a terrific performance,one of his bests. The way he acted out the part of Noah some people can really relate to. Rachel McAdams was absolutely stunning she was the perfect actress for the part of Allie. Together the two make a wonderful movie and made it come alive. Every young couple out there in some way can relate to Noah and Allie and let them know that their love can mean everything. This movie is one of my all time favorites and i can't believe how magnificent it was. James Garner and Gena Rowland made a wonderful appearance in the movie too. They showed you how much the two main characters loved each other and would hold onto each other forever even through the good times and bad times. They will still love each other and die together and stay with each other forever. Go and see and i'll guarantee This movie will be the best you've seen ""The NoteBook""",The Notebook

I mean don't get me wrong the girl can act and I don't think anything negative about her, Its just after seeing her in mean girls and the hot Chick i will always see her as the person good to play the part of a preppy girl who is spoiled and doesn't have a care in the world. Also the movie is supposed to be set like sixty, seventy years ago and they did not do a good job at acting like they were living that long ago. I admit it was a good love story its just a few things that spoiled the whole movie.

It reminds me to the famous couple Ethan Hawke (Jesse) and Julie Delpy (Celine) from Before Sunrise / Sunset. Yes, true love last forever, it is the only way for eternity. The story is read by an old man to an old woman. It is about two young people from different social class (Noah is poor and Allie is rich). They fall in love and their love really lasts forever.

681,perry_63-1,The Notebook is an old-fashioned love story ...,9,28 June 2005,"The Notebook is an old-fashioned love story with the subject of Dementia thrown in to heighten the tear jerking experience. The movie opens with James Garner telling a story (from a notebook) to an elderly woman played by Gena Rowlands. She appears to have a memory problem. The story is about a summer romance, a tale of love between a society girl (Allison Hamilton) who meets a young mill worker (Noah Calhoun) at a carnival, June 6, 1940. They are both 17 years old. Allison's (Allie) parents don't approve of Noah, because of his social standing (meaning, he doesn't have one). Young Allie's heart is broken when her parents try their best to split them in two. After their summer romance is over, when Allie is sent off to college in New York and Noah has to enter the military and World War II in Europe, you would think that there would be no way for this uncommon romance to get back together. However, true love has no boundaries.The performances by James Garner (old Duke) and Rachael McAdams (young Allie) are outstanding. The screenplay is based off of the Nicholas Sparks heart-warming book. I'm not normally into romantic movies, put this movie was so well put together that I had to give it 10 stars. If you miss seeing the old-fashioned Hollywood love stories, then you must see this movie.",The Notebook

They behaved as real people would behave.There was a lot of emotion, and we actually cared what happened to the people.I guess my criticism is that they gave the ending away a little too early. We both thought there would be one last twist to the story, but there wasn't.We thought we had it figured out that she ended up going with Lon but Noah was the one to join her when she needed him the most in the nursing home. Thought that would have been a good ending. And the kids visiting the home then would have been her kids, but not his, except for the one different looking one who was the product of the affair she had with him.Our idea anyway, but we were both satisfied with the movie the way it was.We cared what happened.One last thing - we thought the girl's dad was kind of weird compared to the other people in the movie. Kind of a cartoonish character which clashed with the other earthtone real people.",The Notebook
683,miarae,Beautiful movie,10,20 November 2006,"The Notebook is one of my favourite movies. Not having seen it in cinema, and not having heard anything about it, it caught me off guard. It seems like this is just another summer romance, the age old battle between rich and poor people. I bought the DVD, preparing for a movie that put a smile on my face.But, The Notebook did more than that. It made me cry, made me laugh and made me fall in love with all the key characters. The acting is amazing, James Garner and Gena Rowlands did an amazing job, as did Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. McAdams, whom I knew from her performance in Mean Girls, blew me away with her portrayal of a girl who is torn between two loves and thus two lives. She is a very promising young actress and had a lot of chemistry with costar Gosling, who also did an amazing job. The producers & director of ""The Notebook"" should be proud, they made each and every character in this movie likable, which is tough. Yet they did a terrific job! I feel that everyone should give this movie a chance, because it will certainly find its way into your heart.",The Notebook
684,ggrodzinsky,Decent Tender Movie,8,30 April 2006,"I have seen several movies with similar plot elements in the love story, the old house rebuilt by a poor man for his beautiful love interest (including It's a Wonderful Life which includes a beautiful love story), poor vs. rich, forbidden love, even some of the lines. However, what wins me over in this movie are the tender moments between the characters, both when they are old and when they are young. The love scenes and the female character's nerves in the first one and the respect and support of the male character are tasteful, and tender as I have ever seen and foreshadows the support he gives her in his advanced years. The whole courting starting from the dance in the street to ""I love you's"" is very sweet. The only weakness I saw in the courting was a fiddle dancing scene at Noah's home that I thought just looked silly and unnecessarily stereotypical of the south. In contrast, painstaking efforts were made to make this period piece an accurate representation of the times and it reaped dividends. I agree with the goof section that South Carolina is very hot and humid in the summer and seeing your breath even in the middle of the night is not common unless it is foggy. It implies that it is cold and it is rare for temperatures to go below 65 degrees at night. The other aspect of this movie is how they deal with dementia and Alzheimer's, a disease that I dread ever getting. How does one deal with a love one who cannot remember you or may never again return the love that you have given? This is even more compounded by the fact that in this case the love is as intense as one can imagine, where the emotional honesty of the couple is healthy and where they constantly feed off of each others emotions, feelings and opinions. You are losing your partner in life, the other half of your soul, the person you can open your heart to every day, what do you do? The dedication by Noah to his deteriorating wife even with his own health problems and the strength of their love is what touched me the most. This type of problem affect millions of couples in the US alone and the tenderness and the brief ""returns"" of Allie brought tears to my eyes. The last scene seemed a stretch, but illustrates what couples with intense relationships do when one can not be with the other. When one dies, the others dies shortly thereafter. As for relating to the characters, I cannot personally directly unlike other critics, but I have parents, and other people of my parent's time who had to deal with issues such as these. One was a couple where one married another in forbidden love because they were from conflicting cultures, and their love was clear and intense, then one got MS, the other got cancer. In their case the woman with MS had to take care of her critically ill husband. When he died she got the same cancer and died a year later! My folks said it was love at first sight.They did a great job. I give it an 8 out of 10 only because of the minor criticisms I had that got to my pet peeves.Acting comments: I got to see the Rachel McAdams interview for the part of Allie with Ryan Gosling reading the lines. Pretty amazing how she could get in character with no set, no direction. So much so that she was crying for real after she was done. That's talent.",The Notebook
685,angel_charmed9,Love the Notebook,10,5 July 2005,At fourteen years old I really hate romantic films but this one is so much different in many ways that cant be explained unless you watch the movie yourself. The acting was brilliant! I don't think any other movie has better casting! The story was original and not predictable at all. I recommended movie strongly for everyone. It will capture your heart and remain in your mind as one of the best films of all time. To me this is Rachel McAams break-through role as well as Ryan gosling. This movie broke rachel away from the teenage-flicks. I wouldn't never thought she had this much talent to land this role as her other films don't give her the chance to shine. And Ryan Gosling...I didn't even know who he was until this film came out. Both of them will have steady careers ahead of them.,The Notebook
686,WithoutWings,"A beautiful, romantic story about two very different people",9,11 June 2005,"I was kind of cynical about this movie when it first came out, and had absolutely no intention of seeing it. But as the media frenzied over it more and more, declaring it was one of the best films of 2004, I began wondering if 'The Notebook' was worthy of a watch. So, when the DVD release came out, I borrowed it from Blockbuster. I was already pleased with the summary of the movie's plot on the back of the DVD; it wasn't one of those ordinary love stories, and the fact it was set in the 50's was also a pleasant change from all the typical, modern-day romantic comedies. I thought both Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams acted their roles with great passion and there was an also unmistakable chemistry somewhere between them. The story was just absolutely beautiful and unique; unlike any other. As it unfolded, it made me feel happy, it made me feel sad and it made me feel warm inside. I won't spoil the ending for you, but I'll tell you it made both happiness and sadness well up inside of me. An amazing cast pulled off an amazing movie based on an amazing novel. Not only is this romantic movie unlike others; being set in a time quite different to ours, it has two sides of it, the present and the past. This movie is definitely worth your time, and you'll definitely not regret it. The DVD's got a bunch of extra features, so you should pick that up too.",The Notebook

This is a genuinely great love story that has enough of a plot to keep you entertained throughout the movie. It does go with the very popular cliché of the bad boy country boy chasing after the privileged girl and the family doesn't approve but imo not so professional opinion it was well,written, well put together, well acted. The list goes on and on The on screen chemistry between the 2 stars (Ryan and Rachel) was fire hot and it stayed to the very end. James Garner does a great job with his story telling and showing so much compassion to his sick wife, showing he was willing to do what ever it took to stay with the love of his life.

The movie's scenery is even more beautiful than I last remembered living in South Carolina!!) 3.) I am also mesmerized by the very actors that have played these characters!

I am only 15 yet I found it very intriguing and loved the whole plot of the story.I really think the actors who played Allie and Noah done well in their acting, and it goes to show that Rachel who plays Allie, isn't just a young adult who has to play roles in teen films like Mean Girls but can play a variety of roles instead of a dumb blonde!! I think she is a great actress and is the perfect person to fill this role.I hope I do get this film on DVD as I am sure that I will enjoy it time and time again, as it is already 1 of my favourites!!

Ryan Gosling was, as always was awesome in his portrayal of Noah,a poor working class guy who falls in love with Allie , a beautiful rich girl . Their relationship not well received by Allie's parents which leads to separation of couple forcibly . Noah worked for military during world war . He lost his friend in war. Noah wrote one letter a day for one year to Allie war which were not dispatched to Allie by her mother.He rebuilt the old house to fulfill the desire of Allie. Both of these instances shows how much he loved the Allie. Allie got engaged with someone. When she watched Noah's photo in newspaper she felt divided between Lon and Noah . She couldn't resist her love to Noah . Atlast, couple was reunited. The story is deep and bittersweet, but ultimately rewarding. The screenplay and lines are wonderful and the director Nick Cassavetes succeeds in making a movie that makes you feel different emotions. heartwarming and heartbreaking feelings .",The Notebook

696,orittele,A love story - but not a cheesy one. AMAZING.,10,23 September 2006,"I've never wrote any review on IMDb, but this movie touched me so much that I had to. Why? It's little hard to explain. On surface, this movie would be one that I'd completely hate: a love story, which - based on my experience with all the crap that I've seen coming from this genre - would have turned out to be a cheesy movie, with stupid dialog and a predictable ending. Also, most of the movie takes place in the 40's and 50's, and the characters are dressed accordingly, which is another thing that I usually find not really flattering or interesting. However, ""The Notebook"" escapes from all the obstacles gracefully. The writing, directing, acting, music et Al are all spot on, and they add up to a wonderful, delightful story that you're being drawn to from the very beginning. It has funny, sweet, painful and dramatic moments. It's a love story read from a notebook by an old man to another woman, and it's told in both the past and the present. At the course of the movie you get to see all the stages of this love story. Words can't really describe - you'll have to watch in order to appreciate it. Very recommended.",The Notebook

698,evenstar-13,Fantastic,9,29 September 2005,I really loved this film but surprisingly enough it really never took off in Ireland. When I heard that this film was released I deliberately read the book first because I'm a firm believer that the books are better. In this case I feel the film hit the target spot on. It was brilliantly edited and I thought that the two younger leads were fantastic but then I've been a big fan of Rachel McAdams since Mean Girls. I thought she played the role of Allie superbly and it just shows what a fantastic actress she is. To brutally honest though I was never as interested in the older couples story and I enjoyed it more when they stuck to the main story. But luckily I did buy the DVD about two weeks ago and I definitely think that it gets better every time you watch it. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good old fashioned love story.,The Notebook
699,hey_stella_stella,Predictable Harlequin Romance,2,26 June 2017,"A fairly boring film that will appeal to people who have no sense of history. Too many anachronisms (like Allie beginning a sentence with 'Like' which did not become a speech habit in the US until the 1970s; or Noah's hair after the war - again more '70s than late '40s or '50s). The manners and behavior are also not in keeping with the times. And Allie screaming all the time as a means of conveying 'emotions' gets grating after awhile - just want to tell her to shut up already. The characters have no depth and arouse no particular sympathy. If you're into formulaic Hallmark romances, this is the stuff for you.",The Notebook

Their feelings stay intact in spite of the distance, the time, the lost ones, a horrible war until they find each other together and in love like before, like always in the same spot where they fell in love when they were young, looked for answers that they already knew.

You might find it predictable but what makes this movies great is the story. It shows how much two people love each other no matter what the circumstances are. I couldn't think of better actors to play Noah/Allie. Most of the people in the theater stayed seated after the movie to wipe their tears off their eyes. This movie is breathtaking!

704,un50,Very Meaningful,10,27 August 2006,"My husband and I had gone out to dinner to celebrate our 58th Anniversary. We had planned to watch a new Pay-For-View Movie when we returned, but happened upon ""The Notebook"" and were soon mesmerized from the beginning to the end. It was a perfect conclusion to a memorable occasion, especially for two who married very young, have been together so many years, and are presently approaching the age of 80. We had to choke back tears at the end.I was especially impressed that, before she had completely gone into her own world, Allie had written a note asking Noah to read the story to her when she could no longer remember the events. She was completely lost in the plot each day when he came to read to her. I wanted to believe that she would eventually find her way back to reality, as she did, if only for a short time. The most tender moment, of course, was when she again realized who Noah was as he climbed into bed with her.Our daughter was thrilled that we had shared this movie together, as she had seen it and also owns it. She thought, as did my husband and I, that it was very special.",The Notebook

However, the movie ended up being much more than a pretty face. The storyline is based on a brilliant NY Times bestseller, and the screen adaption is as good as one could hope for. The movie grabbed me, and made me feel like part of the story. However, what really separated this from other romances, is that it was a story WITHIN a story. The viewer is treated to two spectacular stories, side by side, each of which is necessary for the powerful effect that the movie creates. Story WITHIN the story occupies the bulk of the movie, and is wonderful in and of its self. But the OTHER story was what moved me to tears.I'll be hard pressed to find a romance that can match this anytime soon.",The Notebook

It even adds something new to a typical romance. It's one of those movies where perhaps if you haven't seen thousands of movies you'd think it's good going on great, but for me it's just good.Perhaps I can't relate to the young couple in love that always gets into heated fights but still are madly in love with each other.

It's the phenomenal acting and the superb directing make this film a stand-out. There is so much chemistry between the film's two young stars (Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams), that you forget that they are not real life lovers. These two have bright futures ahead of them. Even for people who are not hopeless romantics (myself included), it would be difficult to watch this movie without truly caring what happens to everyone and how it will all end.

Garner's works to pull her mind back, to help her experience the joy of shared memory... of a lifetime together full of love and happiness.

""Based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks"" should have given me fair warning that this was going to be a tearjerker, but did I come prepared? Oh no. And by the time the credits rolled, my left sleeve was absolutely soaked.Some critics will say this film is maudlin. Others will complain that it's manipulative and predictable. But this ""Sweet Home, Alabama"" meets ""The Great Gatsby"" tale connected with everyone in our viewing audience.A test screening agent asked me what I thought of the film afterwards and I couldn't come up with anything intelligent or inspiring to say. I was too choked up, too affected and so I mumbled something incoherent like ""beautiful cinematography; an incredibly romantic love story."" Needless to say, more appropriate blurbs have since come to mind.Thanks to the tremendous acting talents of Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, James Garner, Gena Rowlands, Joan Allen and James Marsden, I was completely swept up in the grand romance of this story. Once the lights dimmed and the first images appeared on the screen, I gave myself over to the filmmakers.

It becomes evident that the story Garner is reading to a patient in a nursing home (Gena Rowlands) is more than just a novel. Gosling and McAdams are young lovers who meet, date, lose each other, and reunite. Although some of the plot twists were predictable, the story was so cleanly directed and beautifully filmed it more than makes up for that shortcoming. A fine film for romantics of all ages.

I saw Red Eye (also McAdams) over the weekend and decided it was time to sit down and watch the DVD I had bought two weeks ago. I was captivated from the beginning. The story is very well developed. I especially appreciated the depths to which their love had gone. Noah makes a promise to Allie that he keeps even though he is likely to never see her again. Despite the fact she may never know he had kept his promise his love for her lived on. I have to say this is one of the most touching stories I have ever come across. I honestly cried three times with the final tears ending at least 20 minutes after the film was over. In my opinion this is a must for anyone who believes in love.,The Notebook

Angst and regret, to name a few.As per the title of this review, those who can and do appreciate the art of filmmaking will find this movie, despite having a budget of $129 million, extremely disappointing and poorly put together.From beginning to end this movie is cliché, and at no point during the film will viewers find themselves surprised or taken aback by any pivotal plot developments for there are none.All in all do not buy in the hype behind this movie for there are much sadder, much more romantic, and much better movies to watch",The Notebook
719,keionancyna,It supports cheating!!!!!,2,25 February 2021,"First of all this movie is so cliche. The only reason I watched it because my many people were saying that this movie is thier favorit, so i wanted to see it.
But it was terrible, I dont even understand what people found in this movie to love. It's so unreal, who would ""fall in love"" with a stranger risking his life just to go out with a girl. Noah was not special and they had absolutely nothing in common, they showed us that in the movie when they always were fighting, the only thing they had in common was the physical attraction.
In my oppinion, Lon was the perfect guy for her, he was funny, rich, handsome and they had pretty good time together and actually had something in common. Allie was acutally in love with Lon, and she was physically attracted to Noah, because she said that many time, that she was in love with Lon but she stll slept with Noah and that is CHEATING, I would NEVER EVERY support a movie like that, I dont care how much Allie missed Noah but she still cheated on her future husband.

Then the spouses etc. The patients would look at photos and ask me who these people were and wonder where their parents were etc....... heart-wrenching to watch.

722,ykeslley,A different love story,10,4 June 2019,"The Notebook (2004) is a prequel movie based on the novel written by Nicholas Sparks. It won awards as MTV Movie Awards: Best Kiss, Teen Choice Award: The Best Movie Drama, BMI Music Film Award and some others.
The features ""A Walk to Remember"" and ""Textuality"" were inspired in this novel. Directed by Nick Cassavetes, who also directed the movies such as ""The Wraith, Blind Fury, Delta Force 3"".
The movie is about the young love of rich Allie (Rachel McAdams) and worker Noah (Ryan Gosling) from a family without financial resources. The setting is the 1940 decade in South Carolina. They meet in an Amusement park during the summer holidays and they stay desperately in love, but the young lady's parents don't approve of the dating because of their social differences. So, to avoid any approximation, her parents send her away.
For a year Noah writes to Allie every day but has no answer. Believing that Allie is no longer interested in him, Noah goes to World War II. Meanwhile Allie meets a charming officer when working in a Hospital. He served in the World War II, and belonged to a very wealthy family. So, when Noah returns to the small town years later, close to Allie's wedding, it soon becomes clear that the passion is not over yet. As her love for him still existed, she must choose between the fiancé and her first love. Decades later, elder Allie suffer from Alzheimer´s disease and lives in a nursing home.
A man visits her regularly and reads to her a notebook with ancient memories trying to bring back the moments that her illness is erasing. To find out who this man is, you need to watch the movie!!!
Those who like romance films, this is the movie for you. Very well directed, exploring a lot of chemistry and passion. The story involves you and has good dynamics. It's worthy to appear among the best novels of all time.",The Notebook

Another think that was really important in the beauty of this movie is the fact that the action takes part in 1940, when the people were different in many ways....but good ones. In that time, the love stories between people were more powerfully, romantics....in our days is more hard to find a person like Noah or Allie.....that's the amazing think in this story:their sincerity and their kind of love.... i'll never see a movie like this never and i want to graduate all the team that realized the movie especially the actors....you rock!!",The Notebook

728,drudo_182@yahoo.com,"overall, solid film.",8,14 June 2004,"Hello,I got a chance to see the new Ryan Gosling film, 'The Notebook' directed by Nick Cassavetes (John Q) Saturday night during its sneak preview this weekend. The theatre was sold out, which shocked me because I hadn't really seen it being plugged too much but the trailer for the film was really good and had me wanting to see it so I can understand why. And I'm willing to bet it's a big hit with the older crowd. They were in full-force.Anyways, on to the film (spoilers ahead). It's a simple movie based off the novel by Nicholas Sparks (I haven't read it if it makes a difference). It begins with James Garner and Gena Rowlands and Garner reading to her from his notebook at a nursing home. He tells the story of Noah (Ryan Gosling) and Allie (Rachel McAdams) and how they fall in love one summer. This all begins at the carnival where Noah first meets Allie and how he MUST have her. Of course, they fall in love and they spend the entire summer together. But, this wouldn't be a drama if there were not a few plot twits. Namely, its Allies mother played by Joan Allen. After she is late one night and the cops are called out to search for her, she arrives home and gets in to a nice argument with her parents about Noah. He's trashnot for herblah, blah, blah. Noah then decides that maybe it should be over since she is leaving for New York for school soon and that is it. But before she leaves, she gets a chance to tell Noah's friend that she loves him. Noah then decides to write her everyday for a year and of course Allies mother keeps the letters from her. Three years go by, Noah's been to the war and Allies now engaged to Lon (James Marsdan) and the drama continues. There's another part of the story about Noah fulfilling his dream of rebuilding this home that takes place early in the film and after he actually does, he gets his picture in the paper. She see's it and comes to visit him. Sparks fly once again and they fall in love once more. That's the main part of the film and the 'twist' is revealed fairly early on but if you can't see it before thenor after watching the traileryou need to get checked out. It's fairly obvious. As for the good and badFirst, the good. The cast is great, especially Sam Shepard. While he is only in the film like five or so minutes, he is one of the more memorable characters in the film. He had some funny dialogue and the crowd really enjoyed it when he was on camera. Ryan Gosling and Rachel Mcadams were also very good in their roles and Joan Allen did a good job as the ""villain' and she has a great scene with McAdams late in the film dealing with her lost-love and her current husband. It gives her a little more depth. James Marsdan was good as her fiancé but of course, no one wanted to root for him because Gosling just came off as a better guy. As for the older Noah and Allie, James Garner does a good job, especially later in the film when he is able to show more emotion but I did have a problem with Gena Rowlands, but I'll discuss that in the bad. Basically, the entire film fits into the good column. The script was enjoyable and strayed away from a typical 'magical' ending and the dialogue was fine. But there's always some critiqueThe bad mostly consists of two things. First off, some of the scenes were just too darn long and/or not needed. For instance, there is a scene where Allie and Noah dance in the street after they really hit it off and it drags for about two minutes too long. And after the story is told and completed, when we finish the film with Garner and Rowlands, some of it drags on a bit too long like Noah's third heart attack. It probably could have been deleted. My other beef was some of the scenes of Garner reading the story ruined moments in the film. A scene would be moving along nicely then be ruined because we have to go back to Noah getting interrupted because Allie needs to take medicine or go take a nap. It happened a couple times that really took away from some scenes. As for ending itself, the last shot of the film of Noah and Allie in bed together is a great way to end it properly. Nothing magical or fake happens which I really enjoyed. There's not much bad I can say about the film minus a couple small issues.Overall, judging from the reaction from the crowd afterwards, this should be a semi-big hit. The audience was sniffling and sobbing so much at the very end of it all and it was weird because I had never seen a film where people cried this much. You would have thought we were watching 'Schindlers List'. But I do recommend it. Aside from some minor problems with certain scenes and some parts of the ending, it was a solid film and I hope it does well.My grade: 4 / 5",The Notebook

They fought,they kissed, they played,they yelled at each other(screamed sometimes) ,there even the one scene where he says ""..i'm not afraid to hurt your feelings"".they were real with each other.And they enjoyed it.They knew it wasn't going to be all Rosy and easy all the time and they were going to have to work on it everyday-but they wanted each other.They truly liked each other and challenged each other(in my opinion).I also like the fact that the other guy wasn't made a ""bad guy""(as is common in movies) just so her choice would be sooo obvious to the...world. She had to choose based on what SHE knew and wanted.I liked that.They were not perfect, but seemed perfect for each other(cliché,but truth)and being able to watch a love story in comfort of its realis-ticness is a treat and relief.I also like the first 'love- scene' earlier on in the film. Now that was good dialog.Truth.My vote is off by 1 point because of my inability to believe that an elderly man would do that for his wife. That was a bit too fantasy/fairy tale like...or to put it more diplomatically-RARE.I don't think a person can or should be your absolute EVERYTHING to that point.In this movie buff's opinion- its a simple and nice love drama to watch on a rainy afternoon(or not) with pizza and a blanket and someone you can debate with afterward.",The Notebook

The only thing I wish that was added, was more to the story of their children. Would have been nice to see how they progressed in life and to see how the wife contracted her illness. Awesome movie otherwise and a tearjerker x10. Goes to show you how real love should be between 2 people. Maybe if there were a lot of couples like that, the world would indeed be a better place for us all. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. Buy or rent it. You will not be disappointed.

It is a story about real life and how things can work out if you just wait long enough... It was the most beautiful movie I have seen! The actors were wonderful in it, you couldn't ask for better acting... You will be seeing Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gossling in A lot of movies down the road. The place where the movie takes place is absolutely beautiful and calming. This movie deals with death in a sensitive way that we all need to see. Let's admit it we are all scared a little bit of it, but after watching this, it helped a lot. I think it wasn't exactly because they found true love, but rather they were true to themselves. How many people can actually say that about their life? Not many, I sure hope I can when I am older. I am working towards that, I think we all are...",The Notebook

One could wish that if Life were to handle us comparable lemons, that we would make lemonade as well as the couple did in this movie. Some wonderful scenery to go with the movie.The deep feelings evoked reminded us of some elements of the movie 'Titanic', but the sadness somehow more meaningful to the heart.Very endearing, save this to watch (or watch again) when you get a HD 1080p television. Romance your loved one with this movie, especially after you both have overcome your next obstacle.True lovers will find connecting and relate-able points of fulfillment or hope - perhaps both - in this classic.The official website for this movie makes for a worthwhile bookmark.",The Notebook
739,matt-2061,I was caught off-guard!!,10,1 July 2006,"Let me begin by saying that I'm a 38 year old man that NEVER intentionally watches romantic movies. It's just not my thing usually. I happened to catch the last half of ""The Notebook"" one day while flipping channels late-night. I checked the listings on my digital cable and found that the flick was going to be shown again the next day.I watched the whole thing. I actually taped it and have since watched it 5 more times!! Well, Let me tell you, it is the most intense, passionate and realistic romance movie you can imagine! It reminded me, simultaneously, of my High school girlfriend AND my wife. It was (and IS) a VERY personal movie to me. The intense feelings that Noah and Ally share, and the problems that confront them are very familiar to me. I'm sure that they are familiar to millions of people.It is a VERY realistic movie as far as the relationship between Noah and Ally. Their relationship is NOT perfect. They fight often (just like real life!) and there is serious doubt about whether or not they will be, or SHOULD BE, together.The performances by Rachel McAdams and Ryan Goesling, Gena Rowlands and the guy who played Jim Rockford on ""The Rockford Files"" (who's name escapes me, SORRY!), are excellent. The visuals are Phenomenal, especially the ""Duck"" scene. The movie as a whole is FAR better than most.I HIGHLY recommend this film. In fact, I'll offer the following advice: WATCH THIS MOVIE!! If it doesn't Immediately remind you of someone from your past or present, you probably haven't loved!! And if you KNOW you haven't loved, then watch this film to get an idea about what love is. Seriously.",The Notebook

The way the Nicholas Sparks (the author)used his words, you could almost feel their love. But nothing beats the movie. It was casted and played perfectly. You can see the love between Noah and Allie. It takes you through the ups and downs, the good the bad, and everything that goes on with two people who are truly in love. The love the have is the type of love people dream about.

I actually got the movie for my birthday in March and never watched it. Its still in the wrapper. But I caught it on TV tonight and I will most definitely be opening it and watching it A lot. I know that its a movie and I don't believe that people love like that anymore, but it feels good to see it on a movie.

Ryan Goslings portrayal of Noah is so moving i was in love with him by the end of the movie. this film is perfection personified. please watch it! you are also not short on eye candy with Ryan and the gorgeous James Marsden. hmmm. i now order you to watch it!go! if i could id give it 100 out of 10!,The Notebook

Like the main characters only reason to like each other seems to be that Allie is pretty and Allie's parents hate Noah. All of Allie's other personality traits suck. She's boring, psychotic, and cruel all wrapped up into one. Ryan Gosling is hot but eh. He seems emotional manipulative from the start and has a bit of an anger/ drinking problem. The movie just kinda excuses the fact that he's using this random chick for sex when Allie leaves. Both don't give any thought to others and I know it's supposed to be romantic but they just suck",The Notebook

The whole plot was just amazing. The characters were wonderful. Great performance. I just love that it shows how love is so powerful. Its so real because in real life people are so judge mental. Like poor and rich don't belong together. Thats just retarded. A person could be the poorest person in the world and he/she could be the one for you or me. I really loved it when Allie's mother told her the truth. Allie was just like her. Which thats interesting because most girls tend to be just like there mothers. Thats what made this movie so great. It was more like a real story than some fancy made up fairytale.,The Notebook
745,omosule,"Spoils, plot summary, theme, scenes, refrences/",10,22 March 2020,"A star crossed love story being told again to the couple who can't seem to remember. The Notebook based on the book by famous novelist Nicholas Sparks. A story that takes us back to the late 1930s of a high school summer romance. Young, dumb, and crazy in love. Rich girl Allie Hamilton comes to Seabrooke, N.C. Bring your lunch, clock in, and clock out Noah Callhoun meets Allie at a carnival and Noah shows how crazy and how far he is willing to go for Allie. And like that the couple was inseparable all summer. They find an abandoned house that Noah promises to buy and fix and make it how Allie wants it. Allies parents don't accept Noah and his social status which bring lighting and thunder within their relationship. Allie and her family move from Seabrook and her and Noah never talk since. Noah writes to her everyday for a year but Allie's mother hides the letters from her trying to prevent Allie from making the same mistake she almost made. Allie before her wedding to a new man finds Noah's ad in the paper he built for her. The house was the only thing he had left, and he knew deep down it will be the reason he will see Allie again. That blooms love again and they are back at it like they never left.
The theme of the movie is definitely the value of money can't outbuy true love. Allie's parents refused and took Allie back to New York so her summer fling with a poor young boy who makes forty cents an hour couldn't provide enough for their daughter. Allie found a man of looks and had that statue of money to his name. That wasn't enough for Allie; she found herself running back to Noah. Also the power of love does many things to somebody. Allie and Noah grew old together and Noah suffers from strokes and Allie suffers from chronic dementia. Noah believes she will remember because of the power of love. Then she has those flashes of the memories and her old life because of the power of love. Another major scene of the movie is when Allie comes back to Noah and she begins to leave again, he knows this time he won't let her go this time that their love is too strong and pure to let go again.
A scene analyzing is the scene where Allie and Noah get off the canoe from being caught in the rain and they open up about their feelings. The motif, angles and dark lighting and adding the rain to the scene shows how much they've been through together in the past. During the toughest storms now they are going to be together.
A reference to another film like the notebook is another Nicholas Spark book called the Best of Me, where a family feud within the movie. The high school summer loving couple split apart and that love never disappears and only grows stronger.",The Notebook

I laughed, cried, yelled at her parents in anger, and sighed with content. No other movie has ever inspired such a reaction from me, and still gets me each and every time I watch it.

747,evyaditi,An excellent film,10,9 May 2020,"The Notebook
When the film's premier of the film occurred in 2004, all the people in Mexico was exIiting for to watch it, because an excellent actress of it is a quite popular in my country, I am talking about Rachel McAdams, one of the most beautiful woman in the entire world. A lots of people was waiting for watching a gripping and romantic history of love.
This film was directed by Nick Cassavetes and was based on a book written by Nicholas Sparks in 1996.
The film goes back to a nursing home in the South of California where an old man was reading a book to other old lady with an illnes (Alzheimer) where the old man talk about a story about a handsome man (Noah by the actor Ryan Gosling) with a charming smail who was out of his mind for a woman (Allie by the actress Rachel McAdams), this guy was in love at the first sight when he saw the girl. The first problem that appear to Noah was trying to catch the attention of Allie doing crazy and moving things which took effect like an arrow in her heart giving an opportunity to have a love date with Allie, doing this story one of the best that the screen had ever seen in life with fascinating characters.
The film ouperform the typical stories of love because when a girl belonged to a rich family and the family's guy was average, is really difficult to have an excellent relationship, because of the interests of the parents, this is a key piece in the story due to the true love can break up all the obstacles.
The only thing that it was ommited is the music, I mean that this kind of films need to be immortalized by an amazing soundtrack; I think, it was the only bad point in the development to the film.
If you are considerated like a romantic viewer, don´t doubt about to watch it, because you will never regret to take the desition. I think that the director put his soul doing this piece of art. I can tell you that when you will watch the final you will cry dramatically and you could remember your first true love or your best relationship because it is really a tought-provoking film and exceded my expectations.
I hope my point of view can help you to take a good desition due to this film exceded my expectations.",The Notebook
748,threester,The Notebook : Based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks,10,29 June 2004,"Often times when a movie comes from source material such as a novel that did well, the people who were fans of the book end up not liking the movie as much. Sometimes those same fans even end up hating the movie, or not even giving it a chance by seeing it. Such was the case, that I already knew the ending of Nicholas Sparks's novel even before I got into the theater. Let me clear up though, that the best thing about the film was that I ended up getting wrapped in the story on the screen, rather than sitting there thinking to myself what part of the story should be coming next. That is what makes a great adaptation, when you can get lost in the story, and forget about your thoughts, or what is going on in the outside world. Not only that, but the film soared past any expectations that I had for it from the start too, by being very well Directed and acted. Best known for his acting credits, Nick Cassavetes was tapped to direct this film. His past experience, which didn't consist of very many films includes the Denzel Washington film John Q. This was not going to be an easy task for him though, because the story was built on us believing the love that the main characters of the film would be showing was real. It?s not as easy as it sounds, and some films (like Star Wars Part 2), end up making the audience laugh, rather than feel what the characters are feeling. He did a great job, and helped put together a great cast for this film that would end up including Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, James Garner, and Joan Allen. All actors who have found their niches before, and were brought in to this film to help carry the story. Gosling is best known for his role as ""Richie"", one of the kids, in Murder By Numbers. He brings a great innocence to the role of Noah Calhoun in the film, one of the two main characters. Rachel McAdams plays the other half of the duo as Allie Hamilton. She was actually one of the leads (Regina George) in an earlier Summer movie, Mean Girls. At the heart of this film the couple represents the love story that is being told by James Garner's character. He reads from a book , the story of the two lovers as they go through everything life has to offer. Gena Rowlands plays the lady that he is reading to, and she gets as wrapped up in the story as we do, as he progresses from chapter to chapter in the novel he is reading. Garner was perfect for this role, and shows his narrating skills as he explains how the two of them live. Meanwhile, in the story, Noah and Allie meet in one of the cutest scenes of the movie. He sees her at a carnival, and knows right away that he wants to be with her. He does not know quite why at first, and all he can say is that something inside of him is drawing him to her. He convinces her to give him a chance, and she eventually agrees to give him the date that he seeks. What progresses from there is a Summer romance that goes through all of the emotions that we all have experienced before. What makes it even more real, is that it is not played off as if every single moment is perfect between the two of them. It depicts that they do have fights, that they do have disagreements, but that they do have a love that is stronger than any of that. This is what made the romance real for me. Everyone knows, that in real life we can't have a relationship where everything works out perfectly, or where everyone agrees on everything. The romance blossoms, but a problem exists that could spell trouble. Noah is from a one- parent family, and sees himself working at a lumber-yard for the better part of his life. He says that he has found his place in life, and this is what the ""cards"" have planned for him. Allie on the other hand, come from a very well-off family, and is being brought up in a rich societal circle. Her family is spending her 17th Summer in the small town by the sea, and first comes across Noah by pure coincidence. The romance between them is kept under wraps for quite a while, until her parents find out. The mother immediately thinks that is should end, but the father feels that it is just a summer ""thing"" that will come to an end rather quickly. That is, until she is out late one night with Noah, and he takes the side of his wife. They see no future between their daughter and this ""boy"", and take her away from him the first chance they get. That coupled with the outbreak of World War II keeps them apart for a couple of years, and the story really gets underway. Will their love be able to endure the separation, or will one of them move on to something that is easier in their own lives? The story becomes an epic of its own, as its starts to split time between the story being read, and the story of Garner and Rowlands living in the present day. This is what I love about films like these, as we are given the opportunity to enjoy two different stories going on at the same time. The love shown by Noah and Allie is something that envelopes us, and it makes us forget about the current story. By going back and forth, we are able to look forward to where each of the two stories is going. All of it leads to an ending of each story that is both very enjoyable, and very emotional at the same time. As I said before, sometimes a book can fail to transition to film. This is not one of those cases, as the movie instead becomes its own entity. Both stories have great chemistry between the characters at the center of them. It is amazing just how well the actors/actresses in the parts play their roles, and just how much we as an audience start to care about their lives. As it progresses, we truly care about what will happen to the main characters, and we have in our own minds how we want things to turn out. It is that type of film, where we start to become part of the story, and want them to act or say something specific, that truly makes a great story. Even though this is a movie that is heavily geared to lovers of romance novels, this is a film that I found very enjoyable. I highly recommend seeing this film while it is in theaters, or purchasing it when it hits DVD, because it has everything that is needed for a truly great love story.",The Notebook

It shows you the right way that you should now how to take from the beginning and how to judge your lover (or others) from whom is he not what he has or own. Also, to respect others feelings and emotions especially parents with there sons and daughters.

Rachel McAdams is a very talented actress, Ryan Gosling I remember from a TV-show called Breaker High. And he sure grew up to be a hottie! So if you like movie settings in the '50, great acting and a good love story, watch the Notebook. I'm hooked on it. A little tip: don't watch it on a first date or movie night with male friends. I pretty sure guys will like this movie too, but if you watch it for the first time, tears guaranteed.",The Notebook
752,mksps,Noah loves Allie,10,2 August 2021,"This is a spoiler filled review.So, The Notebook is a story that takes you on a journey in the lives of two characters Noah and Allie. A man and woman who seemed destined to be together. It is the story that makes you question every summer fling or romance you've ever had, how far you will go for love and for some, if you've ever really been in love.The quintessential story of a poor hard working young man who falls in love with a wealthy young woman visiting for the summer. When they initially meet, she is turned off by his bold demeanor, but he does not take no for an answer even going so far as to slightly embarrass himself to get what he wants. Pretty soon, they are so smitten with each other they spend every day together even sneaking off together soon realizing that what they have is more than just a summer romance until they are discovered.They're relationship is no fairy tale they argue, they break up, they make up never seeming serious about either of the two. When they are discovered, Noah listens anxiously as Allie explains and defends her feelings for him while her parents try to tell her he is not good enough for her. He leaves thinking that is the best for both until Allie tries to stop him. The next day, Allie leaves unaware that it would be years before she is to see Noah again. He writes to her every day for a year, but her letters are taken by her mother who hides them away. She seemingly moves on with her life now engaged to a man that her family does approve of until Noah comes roaring into her life again in a major way. Now she has faced with the most important decision she has ever had to make with a reveal that makes the story even more charming and heartfelt.I appreciated the simplicity of the movie. How that could easily be a story your grandparents told or how you imagined their story was while at the same time tackling the very real subject of dealing with the difficulty of loving someone through adversity. The movie made sure to focus on these subjects with just the right amount of interference from other characters to not hinder the movie. You are left with two people who struggle to be together through adversity and how far one man will go to be with the woman he loves.",The Notebook

755,ddyer-36073,"Emotional Rollercoaster of a film, but definitely worth the watch.",10,22 June 2020,"The Notebook is a film about a sloppy summer romance that engulfs our two main characters, Allie (Rachel McAdams), and Noah (Ryan Gosling). After they are torn apart by Allies parents as well as different life paths, it's a fight to get back to each other after years apart as well as new romances.
The theme of this movie is that loves truly does conquer all. It is seen several times by the main characters as they get reacquainted after yeas apart, and somehow still find that they never fell out of love with each other. It is shown in several scenes that regardless of how much our characters fight, they never lost feelings for each other. For example in the famous argument scene where our characters are standing outside of Allies car in front of the house. They are both arguing over whether or not they are going to be together when Noah points out that, that is their dynamic. They fight but in the end they always love each other, proving the point at love conquers all. Throughout the entire film you can feel the emotional connection between the characters even when they are apart, similar to the movie Dear John (2010), another film based on the books by Nicholas Sparks.
What makes this movie extraordinary is the emotional connection and tension you can feel in he film through the use of things such as lighting and angle. In scenes such as the montage of Noah and Allie spending time together in the beginning of the film, the lightning used is a light colorful array, signifying that they are both happy and carefree as they fall helplessly in love with each other. In other scenes, such as the ones taking place in the nursing home and the final scenes of the movie, they use low key lightning in a way to make the scenes more dramatic. The angles help play an important role as well as they create personal and intimate moments between the actors and the viewers. As the camera pans from Noah to Allie, to a wide shot that captures them both, you really feel like you are there with them, watching it all unfold. The director has a way of really pulling out the emotions of the viewers as the characters go through several ups and down of the relationship but eventually figure out that in the end, love does conquer all.",The Notebook

761,store218,"Weak plot devices, bad casting, ruined an otherwise good romance flick.",3,16 February 2007,"All I'd heard of this movie was ""It's so good,"" and ""even guys like it, it'll make you cry."" Well all of the parts designed to make me cry caused me to laugh uncontrollably. Everything that was a flashback was cheesy, but the good cheesy that you'd expect from a romance movie. The characters were likable (loveable even), the story was engaging, and it had a good pace. But it was completely ruined by the parts that took place in the present.The old people parts ruined this flick. I'm sure it was fine in a book, but come on! You've got to stunningly attractive young people (McAdams, Gosling) that become the creepiest looking old farts. Did you see their children? MUTANTS! MUTANTS, I tell you.Come on, you're telling me that sexed up Allie and Noah's are going to produce a litter look like they just fell of the short bus on the way to the mutant registration office. Did you see their son?! RIDICULOUS! It was a seemed more like a weak plot device to have them get old and die together rather than an integral part of the story. It didn't do a damn thing for the story or the characters other than point out how horrible it is to get old. It was like they didn't have anywhere for the movie to go after Allie chose Noah over Cyclops. It should have ended there with Allie painting naked on her balcony and Noah drinking beer and being pensive or whatever it was that he did. WEAK! Really, I understand that the movie is called ""The Notebook"", but they could have found a more original/interesting/less predictable/better way to incorporate that. How about cast a couple of kids that looked like they would have been the offspring of two hard-bodied, sexpots, and have them read it after the death of their parents? Or just show Noah as an old man writing it down reminiscing after the death of his wife. Her crackpot dementia turned this movie from what could have been a good romantic flick to having it go down like a geriatric 50 First Dates (which sucked in the first place).Also, did you notice that Noah only had a southern accent when he had his little cap on? It was lost as soon as he took it off. That was kinda weak too.Take my advice, read the summary on the back of the box, imagine feeling lukewarm for about an hour and a half then being disappointed, then rent something else. Alternately, have your finger on the Fast Forward button and zip through any scene that has old people in it, believe me, it will be better this way.",The Notebook

But in this film everything is perfect, the lines, the scenes, the plot, the characters, (Rachel Mcadams is absolutely astonishing, man she really got a hold of my heart ;D, of course her acting is also very good). I really think you should see this picture, the movie really eats you up in its story and your sitting there routing for Noah that he gets his long lost love as the time is flying away.

765,krgy-27593,Best romantic movie ever,10,1 November 2020,"The best story is a love story between a poor guy and a rich girl that was forced to separate because of their background. During their separation, they lost contact for 7 years. However, they still love each other the same as before. In the end, the lady had a serious health problem. Make her lose her memory. But the man still keeps a diary for her every day. This is a very touching, realistic, and romantic love movie.
The touching part of this movie is that the actor has always loved the actress no matter what happened or how many conflicts they had together, his love never faded. With time gone by, the actor is always by her side. His love is pure and true. That is what I found touching about this movie.
What's realistic about this movie is that the main point of this story is the poor and the rich fall in love. Although love should not have limitations nor differences between the two people, however, the truth is sometimes things are not that easy to be as we wanted. The girl's parents were against their relationship and forced them to break up. It is silly but realistic just like reality.
The most romantic scene of this movie is when the actor asks the girl to go on a date with him, they walk around downtown. They dance, they sing, they laugh, they kiss. In that scene, the background was somewhere in a small town with slightly bright street light and a little rain with beautiful music makes it the best couple scene in the movie. Everything was beautiful and romantic.
This movie is one of the best love movies in the world, it is touching, realistic, and romantic. A great choice when choosing a warm love movie.",The Notebook

I had to sit through this movie, and boy was it boring. It dragged on and on and on. It had a very stupid script, with corny and idiotic lines from poems that are trying to make this movie memorable. Well let me tell you its only memorable for the lack of quality in this movie. The only good thing about this are the special effects (such as the boat scene at the start), which is why i gave it 2/10 instead of 1/10. The reason this movie is so bad is because it is using a story that has already been beat to death in the movie industry - the happy ending love story. Also the stupid idea of the old lady (who ends up being the female main character just older) magically regaining her memory temporarily, despite the fact she has dementia! Wow, what a miracle! All in all i give this boring, predictable and unoriginal movie 2/10 simply on the fact that the acting is average and the camera work and special effects are passable.",The Notebook

Not only was the plot tremendous, and the characters perfectly cast, but the movie was actually better than the book, which is almost unheard of. James Garner was at his best as the tender hearted husband who takes care of his life-long love (played by Gena Rowlands). Rachel McAdams, who plays his first love in their younger years is perfect in her role as a sexy, energetic young women who has to make the hardest decision in her life. What makes this movie so great, is the chord it touches, amongst all of us. We all remember our first love, and the mistakes we made with that person, and the consequences we live with every day of our lives.

But this movie was touching because it puts the spectator into a kind of reality which is far different than the existing reality that we are familiar with. This, for several reasons: the love story at hand is one which would hardly ever take place in real life, it's too perfect and fascinating. Other than that, the way in which events occur and take place is very far-fetched, but not at all in a negative way. Like I said, in the course of watching the movie, the spectators zone out into that imaginary reality, and I guess it's a good way to reach and basically experience these sentiments indirectly.

However, most end either with the lovers parting or with them finally together after some conflict, ready to begin the rest of their lives together (which the audience will never see). The Notebook shows us a couple whose love for each other is as strong in their later years as it was when they were young. Although we don't see all their years together portrayed in the film, the visit from Duke's children and the photo montage gave me a good enough glimpse of their lives. In that photo montage, I was sure I saw one actual photo of Gena Rowlands with John Cassavetes (instead of James Garner). Since Gena Rowlands and John Cassavetes were married, and the parents of director Nick Cassavetes, I thought it was touching. Can anyone confirm whether there is such a photo in the montage?",The Notebook

I recommend it to everyone, who loves the romantic movies with happy endings. I was really touched by this movie and it inspires me a lot. So, if you ever watch it, try keeping a tissue box near you. ""The Notebook"" is about this young couple that meets in North Carolina, but yet gets separated by Allie's family, because they think that Noah isn't good enough for her, so they part and then came the World War II. Sometime later Allie sees Noah in the newspaper with their dream house in the background and Allie decides to meet up with Noah. At that time she was already engaged with a wealthier soldier she met, while she volunteered for first aid help. When Allie visits Noah the love starts to spark again. The best scene is when they are on the lake and Allie is confused why Noah never wrote to her for seven years.I don't want to say much more, otherwise the whole movie would be revealed.

Maybe because of the lack of depth in the characters. You never really got to know them.Romantic movies usually are like this though and this has to be one of the best but it doesn't is as great as for instance 'pride & prejudice'.I also didn't like the scenes with the old couple.

776,richac-84438,A Love Story to Stand the Test of Time,10,24 March 2021,"In The Notebook, the plot is a was a love story between a poor, young, mill worker, Noah Calhoun and a rich, city girl, Allie. It was staged as a summer love affair that was doomed from the beginning because Allie's parents did not think Noah was good enough for Allie. The opening scene with the swans and the color of the skin give you a sense of sadness, especially when the camera cuts to see the swans flying away, returning to where they came from.During an argument with Allie and her parents in their southern home, Noah leaves their parlor after overhearing the argument and Allie's parents disapproving of him and their relationship. Allie runs after Noah in a desperate attempt to stop him from leaving. Noah knows it is not use and Allie picks a fight with him. Allie's parents decide to leave South Carolina and head back to the city early. Allie tries to see Noah one last time to tell him she loves him, but he is not at the lumber yard. She leaves town and their love story seems to end after a year of Noah writing to her with no responses. Noah leaves for the war and loses his best friend and comes home to his father. His father sells his home so Noah can achieve his dream of buying a rundown plantation and soon after that his father passes away. Noah has no one left, so he pours his heart and soul into the homestead.On a trip to the city to get the appropriate building permits he spots Allie on the street; he rushes off the bus to see her through a restaurant window kissing another man. Noah had no idea she was engaged to another man. He went home broken hearted. After the house is complete, he tries to sell the property, but refuses all buyers. He has his picture taken in front of the house and Allie sees it in the paper while being fitted for her wedding dress.Meanwhile you see an older Noah and Allie in a nursing home, where Noah is reading to Allie, the story of their life because Allie's memories are slipping, and she doesn't remember who Noah is in the story. The way the flashbacks are a bit dimmer in their presentation compared to the young version of them gives you the sensation that their love story is truly coming to an end.As the story concludes, Allie and Noah finding their way back to one another despite all obstacles, the rich tones of the house Noah built for her represent the depth of their love and commitment to one another, even though they both knew it would not be an easy road to travel. As the movies closes the halo wrapped around them with light gives you the impression of peace, that their love did conquer all.",The Notebook

779,neerachanarak,Romantic and crazy in love,8,5 March 2021,"For me, this movie is very romantic. There is depth in love About a teenage couple's summer love where the financial position of the house is different causing them to be separated. Many people judge that their love will end when they are separated, they will stop loving each other on their own. But in the end, both of them returned to love each other again at the right time when they were really ready. This movie is like a book that tells a story. The narrative of the movie is very good. By telling their love story from leading actor to leading actress because of her amnesia he acts like he is the person who comes to read the novel from the notebook but actually, he does not read anything he tells from his memories and finally, she remembers that the story that he tells is not a novel from the book but it happens between him and her. And I think the title of the movie comes from this part. So, I would rate this movie review 8/10. Another 2 points that I deducted because, during the course of the story, the leading actor looks crazy in love with the leading actress and doesn't forget her for a long time. Which doesn't seem realistic to me. The leading actress meets a new love and almost get married. This love is agreed with both her parents. Because their financial position is not much different but destiny brings them to meet again so she leaves the wedding and comes back to him. That is the love that they both wistful for each other all the time. I think it's the normal plot of a romantic movie that is worth watching.",The Notebook

I hope that my love life was as deep and together as Allie and Noah's. Of course life really never is as wonderful as people make it in movies. Love is a complicated thing or emotion. Allie and Noah loved each other but sometimes love works and then it doesn't. The Notebook is a beautiful tale and it gives people who watch it a whole different meaning of how two people are so different but yet so in love. Never get mixed up in LUST or LOVE! You know if you love someone when you hold them or they hold you that you could stay in that place/spot with them holding you till the day you die.

782,fordd-81102,The story of heartbreaks & finding unconditional love,10,20 April 2021,"This American romantic drama film portrays Noah as the protagonists because from the very beginning he always had good intentions in wanting to be with Allie. He did not just take interest in her because of how rich she was, he was interested in seeing the real her, outside of the money and ''rich people'' like activities he wanted to see her for her, he wanted her to open up about what she actually wanted for her own life and not what her family thinks she should want. When she could finally figure out how she wanted to live for herself they fell even more in love because he helped her find her true self. The antagonist is Allies family because they are very rich and judgmental. They did not want Allie to be with anyone who's family financial status is what they feel is underneath them and because the family is already rich and they needed her to keep their ''rich'' family name alive so people wouldn't have reasons to talk about them. The Hamilton family strongly disliked the fact that Allie was falling in love with a man that had a regular low class job because he was poor, they also did not want Allie with a man who could benefit her by making her and her family by making them all richer and well known. Noah was never with her for the money he never asked anything of her, just her most genuine love nor took anything from her but her whole heart. Allie and Noah were separated for 14 years, amidst all of that lost time they had never let go of their authentic love they had for each other when they were teenagers and they kept all of their past love and memories for when they would finally meet again as adults. I feel like this is honestly true love because they could not talk nor see each other for years, even despite them both moving on and never bring happy with their new relationships they help on to their love for each other in hopes, with so much faith that they would meet again. I love how the writers and directors made you feel every bit of pain that they had felt from their passionate voices to their body language how aggressive and soft they both were to each other at the same, this is shown from their rough kisses to their huge tight hugs, I loved when Allie would jump into is arms making him hold her while they would hug for an eternity in their minds. They would laugh with and at each other and just always have massive smiles on their face with nothing good positive vibes. They did not need anyone else but one another. This is a kind of love story that does not come often, a love like this is only comes once in a lifetime. I feel like watching this movies makes you want to find a rebel love like this, no matter what our family says we will be together no matter what even if we get separated we will always love and find our ways back to each other.",The Notebook

I like the story presented in the movie-- it's very romantic, so I suspect I would have liked the book, but there's a big problem with the movie. I'm surprised I didn't see anyone else comment on this. I think the directing is poor and possibly the screenplay as well. Rachel McAdams does a great job in spite of this, perhaps she's a superior actor or maybe she's the only one the director bothered to direct. Allie's father was particularly laughable with his obviously fake hair, fake mustache, and bad acting. All the early scenes in the nursing home were poorly done, I'm not sure if the screenplay, directing, or acting is to blame.

I had many opportunities to see this film, but I didn't really take the plunge, when I finally did, I didn't regret it at all. After watching it twice, I wouldn't hesitate to watch it a third time. The Notebook stands out from other films of this genre, thanks in particular to its rich and moving dialogue and delicate direction. The acting in the film is of course remarkable. We are absorbed into the great story line.We are plunged into the 30s/40s following the story of a summer love between Allie and Noah which becomes more and more serious. This love story is not monotonous, there are many twists indeed the two main characters are not from the same social background. That love is not impossible and that when one is in love there is no obstacle. This love will never leave them it seems like this love follows them. It's perfectly captured on screen through the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, who seem to be fully in love.Of course, for some, it will be too much, but for romantics like us, such a beautiful melodrama.The last twenty minutes were absolutely tearing at your heart strings and gave me a real slap in the face, they reminded us that love is the most powerful thing against age...

Rachel McAdams was absolutely brilliant in ""Mean Girls"", but she had no place in this role. Adorable dimples are not a good enough reason for casting. Ryan Gosling was appropriately creepy in ""Murder by Numbers"", but again, not right for this romantic role. Drippy dialog and weak acting aside, here was my main problem with the movie. He never tried to find her. Why did he send the letters to her home (where her disapproving mother was) instead of to her at school? Why did he never try to visit her at school or write to her at school? Why did she never try to write to him the entire time she was away at school?

The Notebook is based off the timeless novel written by Nicholas Sparks. This film was directed by Nick Cassavetes. A-list stars James Garner, Rachel McAdams, and Ryan Gosling, together to bring a vibrancy and elegance to this timeless romance.Set in the early 1940's, the story takes place in South Carolina where an idealistic and poetic young man (Ryan Gosling) meets the perfectly raised southern belle, Allie. Together, Noah and Allie's instant connection leads them down a path of crazy, young love. This film shows that connection is difficult to fight. Noah comes from a humble background while Allie has been brought up surrounded by distinguished ""old money"". Noah, being a confident idealistic young man, sweeps Allie off her feet. He surprises her on the numerous occasions that he is not afraid nor ashamed to be himself. Noah is not even afraid to be himself around the snobby individuals Allie has been raised around. The southern charm that drips from the condescending mouths of those of whom Allie associates with is a constant reminder of how things used to be. However, that southern charm and old money was of little consequence when it came to fighting the Nazi's in Northern Africa and Europe.The story follows Allie and Noah's younger lives through the narration of an older and wiser Noah, known as Duke. What viewers come to quickly learn, is that Noah (Duke) is reading to an older Allie who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. Allie only knows Duke as the man who comes to the nursing home to read to her and not as her husband, Noah. There is a moment in the moment when her memory comes back, and you want to be so joyful for Noah as he has his wife back. But the time is brief, and her memory eludes her once again, leaving Noah in tears and shattered. The quality of James Garner's performance is without fault. His raw emotions depicted in the emotional scenes are so very believable that tears are difficult to hold back. The lighting that was used changed with the mood of the scenes. Softer lighting was used in the more intimate scenes. Close-up camera angles helped to feel the emotions of the characters throughout the movie as well.Rachel McAdam and Ryan Gosling come together with strong performances. Their emotional connection is very believable throughout the film. Rachel McAdams did a wonderful job speaking with a southern twang to her voice and Ryan Gosling...well let's be real, it's Ryan Gosling. He could wear trash bag and he'd still receive complements on how well he wears that trash bag.On a more serious note, The Notebook has become an instant classic in many eyes. While some may call it cliché, I call it a timeless romance that offers feelings of hope, belonging, perseverance, most importantly, that love can conquer all.",The Notebook

This movie makes you nostalgic about the one you love. The only thoughts that will come to your mind are to see him/her, to hold him/her, to kiss and never let go! It can help you imagine your life with that person, to better understand that person, and to LOVE that person much more! It will wake up feelings in you that you have never known they existed! Simply THE BEST movie that I have ever seen. In the end of the movie you will feel overwhelmed and MUCH MORE IN LOVE!!!",The Notebook
792,nayhla,Love is the beginning for everything,10,20 February 2007,"I still remember the last sense of the story "" Note Book"".When Allie asked Noah that our love could take us together. Noah said that ""love"" could make anything if we wanted to. That's the point which make me get the love is love is miracle between the two of them. And love is none of other's business except the couple of them. Love is just around you that will never go. It's seems to be everything you know. I use to be lost in the story of love. I believe love is based to trust somebody or to begin everything. I've got many lesson about love when I've watched this movie ""The Notebook"" about the power of love. When you think one don't deserve another one of two lovers to get started for the future of being couple of life. It is not fair or love. Please, be with love and own your body and spirit of love to each other that will make you warm forever without loneliness in the world. Everyone can be lonely because they don't care themselves and find love just being around them. I cry a lot . and feel a lot in the movie.",The Notebook
793,DonLunte,A great love-story,10,4 February 2008,"It is the most romantic movie I have ever seen. Therefore I gave the movie 10 points. The story of a so deep love let every heart start melting.I did not read the novel, but I guess it is also really good.The cast was selected well. They just fit. Not to forget the location which is phenomenal. All the sunsets and the views, just great.At first there is the question how the title fits and why they have chosen exactly 'The Notebook'. In the end it is clear.I really wish I was Noah. I mean, he had to wait like 7 years for his great love to come back, but then they married, had a lot of children and probably a great life.I know I have used the word 'great' very often here, but it is for a good reason. If you watch the movie you are going to affirm that.",The Notebook

If only Ryan Gosling's character had fallen from the carnival ride and she'd married the carny dude who had been responsible for the Texas Chainsaw Massacre in nearby Lot 7 of the Paramount Studios, then we might have had a movie worth watching. What we need is more of the main characters in trite movies to turn into cybermen with secret yearnings to marry daleks.

I read the novel ""The Notebook"" by American novelist Nicholas Sparks based on a true story. The novel & movie compare greatly in my opinion, except for the endings. Possible Spoiler! Depending on what you consider a spoiler! The novel ending was OK, but the movie ending was the best ending for the story ever possible. They couldn't have made it any more awesome, in the movie, for this story! Loved the movie (& Novel), Love the cast, all extraordinary actors & actresses! Loved the time setting also. It had all my favorite features of a movie or story. Romance, drama, a little suspense, it had it's funny moments, & surprises, all into one single awesome movie. A must watch in my opinion!

Everything is so blatantly obvious and no character goes through a journey. They are all one dimensional and boring. There is no suspension let alone any twists.Saying all this, the photography is good and the acting isn't that bad. Still this doesn't warrant 2 stars.Ah, yes, I'll just mention there are some uninspiring sex scenes and the film is also at least half an hour too long.If you want to see a great love story where you feel with he characters and don't know why or how until the end, check The English Patient.",The Notebook

The photography,editing, everything was perfect.The old couple are so cute! I really don't care if a movie of 150 million dollars were nominated, I want to let this clear, a simple movie with a lovely history!I almost cried, because I think this film is a romance hard to find nowadays!This is a movie to watch on a quiet day, a day when you are alone.Or with your love!Shows that nothing can separate us, not the distance or their differences!",The Notebook

A wonderful story based not only on two of the most important things in life (love and hope), but also on the famous quote : ""forever and ever"". A young boy who trusts his feelings so much that he is capable of doing anything standing in his power to be with the girl he likes, a young girl fighting for her love against her own parents, both combined in a struggle of an old man trying to recover the ""she"" for whom he'll stand ""untill death..."" turned the movie into a perfect love story. A true love will last to the end, and so was the end, and they died together, and forever in love cause his power of love and her hope made the wish come true.Drama, comedy, passion, courage, hope, dreams, war and of course romance... what more can i ask from a movie? 10/10.",The Notebook

804,jacksonke,This is one of the best love stories I have ever seen!,10,31 October 2007,"The Notebook is directed by Nick Cassavetes. This movie takes place in Seabrook, North Carolina in the summer of 1940. The movie begins with an elderly man (James Garner) reading a story to an elderly woman (Gena Rowlands) at a nursing home. Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) falls head over heels at a carnival for Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams). Noah is a mill worker, and Allie's wealthy family disapproves of him. Within a few days of being together constantly, Noah and Allie fall in love. Then Allie's parents leave Seabrook and take Allie with them. When Allie moves away, she meets a man named Lon. They spent some time together, and her parents loved him. He asked her to marry him. Right when she said yes, Noah's face came to mind. Noah bought the Windsor Plantation and rebuilt it from the ground up. Allie decides to go visit Noah to see if he is okay. They both still have feelings for each other. Allie has to choose between Lon and Noah. The wardrobe for the movie, as well as the cars, fits really well with the time frame. The music is very old fashioned as well. There is also a lot of symbolism throughout the movie (which I won't give examples of so I don't give anything away).There were a couple of mistakes in the movie. At one part where they are in the Windsor Plantation, Allie says, ""This place is gigantic"" and the words didn't go with her lip movements. There was another part where Allie ran into a stack of logs. Her car wouldn't start back which isn't very likely.Overall I loved this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to see a wonderful love story.",The Notebook

A co-worker of mine encouraged me to watch this movie and I have about ten times. Each time without a dry eye, I even have my husband crying. The two main characters Noah and Allie are so astonishing and have such amazing chemistry on the camera. True love is unforgettable and unbreakable, going to any lengths to get his true love to remember him and keeping his promise is outstanding. I love how in the very end Allie shows up with her bags and hunches her shoulders, beautiful. They were meant to be together as the movie shows until death. Go see this movie!While its been done before, its never been done this way. With such depth and emotion, the predictable ending is no fault of the movie.

I never read the book, but expected a tear-jerker. The movie had a good storyline and good acting (I would not be shocked to see James Garner and/or Gena Rowlands getting a Supporting Oscar nomination), but with 10 minutes left, I was thinking that I had seen many more emotional films. Then the ending came, and I was pretty drained. The whole theater was filled with crying eyes, and people saying this was the best film they've seen in years.

But I've cried while reading the book because he loves her in a way that I've never seen, even in fiction.

I enjoyed watching it immensely and its the closest I've come to tears at a movie sine watching Bambi at age 5. I would recommend this to any and all.

The loss of the love of his life to the most horrible loss possible was still not enough to destroy his love.Each of us seeks the love expressed in this movie. The expression of love in this movie eludes nearly all of us even when it is before us.This movie roused within me the essence of why I married my wife. This movie MOVED me and that is a statement of epic proportion!! This movie revitalized my life and my marriage. A living essence of life that Nick Cassavetes breathed life into is what this movie truly is.To move me, any thing has to be a true expression of life.

The ending although it was sad, left me feeling so happy I'd seen it, and I think the way the director conveyed the tragedy of their love was amazing. After I'd watched it I was left UNABLE to watch any other films! It was all I could think about. I could feel my family just getting annoyed with me talking about it but I couldn't stop! I recommend this film to anyone.

816,BrettAndrews,Wow. Just wow...,10,17 May 2008,"Alright, this is by far the best, as well as most moving movie I have ever seen. I'm a 15 year old male, and the first time I watched this movie, I watched it because a ""popular"" girl, at my high school recommended it to me. I wanted to watch it just because of that. However at 2AM when I was finished watching it, I was in tears. Something I've done before with movies, but not commonly. The whole plot of the movie, the characters, the music. It was amazing. It made me feel like a whole new person. I know, that probably sounds like it's impossible, because it's just a movie, but it really did. The exact moment the credits were over, I just started the movie over again. I couldn't help it. There was not one moment in that whole movie where I was bored, or not thinking about the plot. I felt like, I was shown the true meaning of love or something like that.About a month after watching it for the first time, I went out and bought 'The Notebook' the book. For me, that's crazy. I hadn't bought a book, ever before that. I've read a lot, but never bought one for myself. It was even crazier because it was a Literature Romance. Something no one that knew me would've expected. I was expecting a lot from the book, and I got way more than I expected. It was one million times better than the movie, and if this was the best movie I'd ever seen, then the book obviously has potential. The book was a page-turner. I didn't want to sleep, and when I woke up I just wanted to read it. I finished it pretty fast, in about a night and a day. All I did was read it. By the end of the book, I was also full of tears. It was absolutely heartwarming. Two months ago I never would've thought I'd be crying over a book about love. However I was, and the book has helped me through a lot. I know it sounds pretty weird, but it has. It always makes my heart grow, and help me re-believe in true love. I don't know, nor do I want to know what kind of person I would be without 'The Notebook'.Now, since I bought the book written by Nicholas Sparks, I've bought all of his books, as well as ""Leaves of Grass"" by Walt Whitman, which is mentioned in ""The Notebook"" movie, ""The Notebook"" novel, as well as ""The Wedding"", a follow-up to ""The Notebook"". I'm enjoying poetry, nature, and plenty of things I'd never have thought I would before. The Notebook has truly changed my life, and how I will form as an adult.I just truly, from my heart wanted to thank Nicholas Sparks for creating such a wonderful, heartwarming, touching story, and thanking the actors, actresses, and directors for creating such a touching film. It implements a new section into your daily thoughts, and changes your outlook on life. It sounds like a whole lot coming from just a movie\book, but that's because it is a whole lot. And it's all true.Definitely 10/10.",The Notebook
817,uttamint,Love made 'special'...,10,18 June 2008,"""Wow, genius director!"" That was how I reacted after the movie was over. A simple but emotion-packed story with LOVE so specially focused. It starts so gradually with flamboyance of a lover who falls in love with a girl and the movie moves flawlessly with natural touches of emotions until its time to part and reunion. In today's movies, where the story lines generally don't focus on 'love' thing, mostly being adventures, thrillers, comedies, etc., movies like this one, make 'love' a special feeling, giving all lovers a sense of bonding... the story everyone can relate to! I think it also brings out Hollywood's least explored story scripts best presented. This movie has soft, romantic, bonding touch and a bunch of really good acting talents. A ""must must watch"" for all those who enjoy good love story, guarantee you an 'excellent' story turnout.",The Notebook

Much to my disappointment, the movie failed to impress. It is a typical love story, where you already know the ending.A stereotypical rich girl / poor boy madly in love story... where the society pulls them apart. Performances by Ryan Gosling was okay but Rachel Mc Adams failed to impress, seemed to me all her scenes were overly done, with extreme anger or extreme opposite.All in all, do not anticipate a classic movie here or you will be disappointed.

This movie is great, sad, happy and actually can relate to reality and situations that we have seen in todays life. Love does not always last but we should just follow our heart and do what we believe it is best. We as well should think about when we get older and actually ask ourselves if we see each other with this person? What if something happens to either one of us, are we willing to sacrifice our lives to meet the others standards and so on... this was a little bit long but it was definitely worth it. Definitely recommend.",The Notebook
820,scoopbls-1,Offensive,1,6 July 2008,"I found this movie offensive, It's popularity is telling of the selfish delusional expectations and lack of consideration for anybody other than the couple, in fact the couples happiness should be at the expense of every other person, even when they are portrayed in good character.Unlike other ""love story / chick flick"" components to movies such as titanic etc, the guy she left, who she also happened to be unfaithful to, for her ""true love"", was portrayed as a nice guy throughout the movie. No sympathy was attributed to this guy even though his loss was at the expense of her.Another example of this was shown that the couple had 4 children ranging from young teen to adult. When the movie ended with the pair of them in bed both expiring at the same time, several people claim this was a happy event (a good way to go). Well it is for the 2 people, rather the one that would not have outlived the other and thus would not suffer the loss. However, they are not the only 2 people in the world, there were 4 children. I have had the misfortune of losing a parent. If I lost both at the same time, I don't think I would have thought that was such a happy event. This is another example of the focus on the ""love / romance"" at any cost to others. This happens in a lot of movies, but normally it happens less and the loss is to the ""bad guy"".It goes to show how most women in our society (primarily at a young age) will over value (to say the least) the ""love / romance"" (if you want to call it that) at the expense of anybody else's happiness - even when they are portrayed as good characters.",The Notebook

A real love has to contain passion, loyalty, sincerity and sacrifice in it.And this film includes all of these.An advice for you guys; If you want to understand whether your girl friend or boy friend loves you, watch this movie together in completely dark and sound-isolated place and follow the other's reactions.If your love will cry, then he/she looks at love in the same way.Watch this every year, then remember how a real love must be. If there were number 11 in vote section, I would vote this film with 11. Hope I will find a girl can love me in the way the actor loves in this film.And I wish the same for people who really deserve this.",The Notebook

I'm the one that should not be crying. But I did for like an hour. It started even during the movie. I have a girlfriend for like 2,5 years now, so I do understand what it is to have met the love of your life. Watching movies like this is a bit depressing, but through these movies (tearjerkers) you learn to take some things not for granted. And you love your life even more. Watching this movie gave me happiness, a heart warming feeling, and tears all over the place at the same time. I recommend this movie to anyone.PS: If you want to see another tearjerker, try life as a house.",The Notebook

I thought I wouldn't be able to pay attention, b/c I'd be looking for myself throughout, but I actually missed myself because I was so wrapped up in the story. They did an amazing job adapting the book--one of the best book adaptations I've ever seen.The chemistry between McAdams and Gosling is amazing, and they both brought a really natural charisma to their characters---I didn't see much overacting at all (although I thought their ""accents"" were a little iffy at times). I also liked that there was light humor throughout, breaking it up a bit. The ending, as everyone says, was a tearjerker, for sure, and it probably could have ended without the 2nd ending/fadeout, so to speak. I went two times, and both times, the theatre was sold out and full of sniffles at the end of the film. Anyway, really, they did a stunning job adapting the film, it looks great, and it pulls you right in.

McAdams and Gosling had undeniable chemistry that really made the characters believable. Most of the people I talked to could relate on some level to the characters and their relationships with either each other or their parents. However, to enjoy the movie you really have to be in the mood for one of those sappy-romantic type movies. Most people seemed to enjoy it though. I don't think there was a dry eye in the theatre, including all the teenage guys sitting around me. It was heartwrenching, but beautiful and I think the actors and the director truly did a spectacular job.

From the moment they hit the screen to the end both did a fantastic job. The script was a gem for both to work with. They were natural together and played off each other well. The only problem was I felt they did seem to get tired towards the end of the movie. There roles required a lot of energy and perhaps it was hard to sustain it. The rest of the cast was wonderful though Joan Allen seemed flat. The script was well written and locations beautiful. Costume design is especially noteworthy. Though not a 10 the movie was extremely enjoyable to watch -- especially because of Gosling and McAdams.,The Notebook

This epic love story demonstrates the perfection of great writing, acting, and directing. It is one of the few times where the novel wasn't destroyed by the movie and only makes one curious as to why this is such a rare case of successful articulation and execution.The story of Noah and Allie is the one that each young girl fantasizes about coming true her whole life.

With all the s**t going on in the world right now, this is exactly the type of story that we all need to take us away, to remember the type of love that really doesn't exist between married couples these days, or at the very least is few and far between! These were the times of our grandparents, and the thought that it is possible for 2 people to meet, fall head over heels and be together forever is beautiful!This film was wonderfully shot, and was full of whimsy.

After few years passed, they happens to meet again! They know they still loves each other. Then, the story is finished, and the old women suddenly remember everything!

I don't get into chick flicks so I've avoided this movie, but this wasn't a chick flick as much as it was a movie that simply tugged at your heart through all the ups and downs. I'd never seen Rachel McAdams before and thought she was wonderful. I've seen Ryan Gosling and typically like his work. They were both powerful in their portrayals. I read one review that thought Gosling should have shown more emotion/passion in his portrayal but I thought he played it perfectly - embroiled with internal emotion while revealing very little of it. It is very much the way men tend to operate.Excellent story line, breadth of characters and flow for the work. I'm a guy and I know it's a bit taboo, but if you don't cry at some point in this movie (esp. towards the end), you're just not human. :) Rent it, DVR it or buy it - any option is good, just see this movie.

I saw the film a couple of days ago on Oxygen and I remembered why I truly like this movie. With its era in time and the flash backs between past and present it creates a wonderful story line of true love that opens your heart to all the possibilities in reality. Though reality's story can never be as compelling as Noah (Ryan Gossling) and Allie's (Rachel McAdams), one can only dream. The actors in this particular film did an outstanding job at portraying the Southern classes in that specific time period and in creating an immense chemistry between the two characters. I personally have never read the book, but this movie conveys so much emotion and I can't fathom how much emotion is portrayed through the book. This movie is the ultimate chick flick and as a guy I'm not afraid to admit that I truly enjoy it and have actually cried from it.",The Notebook
841,valy-mazzoni,Love. And do everything for the people you are loving. Even die for them.,9,16 April 2011,"I'm not a big fan of that kind of movies. You know... Romantic dramas etc. But I have to say that The Notebook is just awesome. I little bit unrealistic maybe, but still awesome. It shows us real life-time love that we all are dreaming about. The movie is set in the golden times of America. Nice dresses, shoes, girls, boys, everything is so natural, genuinely etc. When you watch movie you just want to live next to Noah or be Allie's best friend. Everything is perfect actually. And their love is perfect too... That's why I'm giving 9 to this movie. It's just so beautiful, so wonderful, so oh my god.. Too much actually. When I was watching The Notebook I didn't think about that. But when I was done with watching I really figured out that perfection was too big. Noah really built that house. And they really went to heaven together. And... There is a lot of exaggeration.. But good actors and a good story hide it all. The point of that movie the way I see it is: Love. And do everything for the people you are loving. Even die for them. It's never ending story. People will want, search, hope for such a love forever. But sadly everyday there is less Noahs and Allies...'Now say you're bird too.' 'No.' 'Say it!' 'If you're bird I'm a bird.'",The Notebook

The Notebook begins with an older man reading a diary/notebook to a woman affected with Alzheimer's that he regularly visits at a retirement home. He reads this story hoping that the women will remember and realize that they are the characters from the love story. In the movie when the older man reads the notebook, his words bring to life his story about how he met a girl at a carnival and they feel in love, but the young lady's parents disapproved of him because of his financial state and tried to separate them. In the end, World War II evidently separated the two lovers, and after seven years haven taken different paths they then were passionately reunited. They feel in love once again and got married and had children. At the end of the notebook the old women remembers who he is, as she does every time he finishes reading the story to her. At the end of the movie the old man was so happy she remembered her and the end up dying together in their sleep. I would strongly recommend adding this movie to your romance collection.",The Notebook

I couldn't keep from smiling and then eventually crying because of the emotion. This move shows how young love can evolve into so much more-true love. This is a heart-filled movie and every moment is worth seeing it. The movie shows how simple things can make a HUGE difference in your life, and today-with all the technology, we don't seem to see a lot of the good things that we could have had. I only wish I could have been alive in those days. Ryan is a wonderful fit for Noah, as is Rachel for Ally. Your first love may be fate. This is a MUST SEE/MUST BUY movie!!

845,christinenewcomb,The Notebook,9,4 May 2011,"The Notebook is about the journey of two people in love. The main character is Noah. He is an engaging person because he is a simple, average person who prides himself on the love he has for his wife, Allie. The film starts out portraying Noah as an old man in a nursing home getting ready and looking in the mirror, proud of his imperfections. From Noah's first line, the audience is engaged with him and his story. ""I am no one special, just a common man with common thoughts. I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me, and my name will soon be forgotten. But in one respect, I've succeeded as gloriously as anyone who ever lived. I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and for me, that has always been enough.""The story is compelling because everyone wants to have a love as strong as the movie portrays. For the lucky people who have experienced this kind of love, the story brings them back to the beginning and reminds them of the times when all that mattered was being together. -The first love scene shows Noah and Allie as teenagers about to make love for the first time. The film captures the different awkward moments that can occur in that scenario but shows that they are able to look past that because they love each other so much and want this to happen. Their expressions and eye contact truly show how much in love they are and leaves the audience with the same feeling.",The Notebook

Where most films have to try hard to differentiate themselves from the rest of the pack, the Notebook (on its own merit) stands out and gives people an actual story and plot that pulls you in and makes you feel ever emotion.

This movie is excellent if you have truly loved someone, or watched your parents or grandparents love. It actually stirs those sleeping butterflies inside you, those feelings of ""new"" love and lust keeping the viewer very involved in what will happen next. It's predictable in some respects, but worth seeing if you like a great love story. The War scenes were somewhat needless or needed to have been expanded.

The storyline is so romantic and it really touches your heart, whether you're in love or not, because, let's admit it, we all want to live a similar love story. The ending is happy and sad at the same time, and it's difficult for you not to let you tears come out.

""This is just a fight we're having, and tomorrow it will be like it never happened, right?"" well its so touching that I felt jealous for their love...

The movie portrays a love that carries out through the movie that really is like a fairytale. McAdams and Gosling have a serious bond that makes everyone just fall in love with their love. At the end of the movie, pretty much every woman in the theatre were sniffling or still crying (including myself). I am hoping to see it again this weekend. I saw it about 8 days ago and i cant stop thinking about it. I'm hoping to order the book soon, and I've read about every interview I could find on the internet with the actors/actresses.

852,ujoelyn,Amazing Movie!,10,28 November 2011,"Based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks, Nick Cassavates' 2004 The Notebook is the classic story of two teenagers of different classes who fall in love one summer. Allie is the typical southern city-girl, while Noah is a hard-working country boy. As the summer comes to an end, as does their romance. Allie has to go to school in New York, while Noah has to stay home and work. They try to keep their romance alive by writing letters, but are stopped by the mother, who hides all of Noah's letters to Allie. But at last, they find a way back to each other and eventually die old together. The story may be seen as a cliché to some, but it did succeed very well in delivering its message, true loves conquers all. This statement has much truth to it, and has been told in numerous films in so many ways. But it also depends on your personal beliefs and views; I personally believe that it is true. This film showcases that love has no bounds. After so many years two lovers who haven't seen each other in years, since they were teenagers, still felt the same way and were able overcome everything and all the changes that both of them have made over the years.Both Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling fit their roles beautifully. Rachel, who plays young Allie, has a young face and does a southern accent very well. Ryan, who plays young Noah, is a smooth character and is able to transition well into an older character. Both are very good actors and portray their roles well. James Garner, who plays the older Noah, also is a very moving character; his love a devotion to his wife is very admirable. James brings a lot of emotion to this film, and his scenes help to further communicate the message. This film is also successful in conveying the time settings. The movie was filmed in South Carolina, where the movie actually takes place, this helped give the film a more authentic 1940s feel.Nick Cassavates attempts to influence our idea and beliefs on the idea of true love. He is not trying to necessarily change our actions, but more so beliefs. The story's message is universal and can relate to anyone of anytime. There are countless stories and films about summer romances, but none quite like this, the story goes far beyond that. The message of the movie is very relevant to everyone of any time or generation. Everyone can relate to some point of the movie; the lovers who are separated but find a way back to each other, the lovers who overcome all, and of course, the summer romances. Overall, this movie succeeded very well in communicating the message and a very good story. But of course we must give some credit to Nicholas Sparks, who's 1996 novel inspired this film. Nick Cassavates delivered a moving story and an amazing movie. I give this movie a 10/10.",The Notebook

My dad has passed away but my mum is in a nursing home. She has bouts of remembering who I am and at other times she does not know. It is a story that everyone should watch, as it can bring most people to tears. It is so full of emotion, and heartbreak for everyone that was in close contact with Ellie. I have the DVD and I can watch over and over. It is such a debilitating disease that it has such an emotional impact on close ones, and this is highlighted so clearly by the husband and the dramatic changes by his wife. I admired and appalled him for the support,love and understanding at the most difficult times that he gave to his wife. The fact that he never gave up and her and cared for her right to the final end. It is so true when you say your wedding vows, till death do us depart. I thing this movie deserves recognition in the fact that he showed how the disease can affect the human mind, it is uncontrollable,degrading at times and so heart wrenching for all involved in the process of loss of memory. In fact most people go through the grieving stage during the various stage of the disease and not after the person passing away. I have such vivid memories of this movie unlike any other movie that I have seen and forgotten after a certain period of time. I love this movie and will keep watching until my memory fades, which is a strong possibility as the disease runs in both sides of the family. I think a lot of people can relate to what I am trying to express. I hope day there is a cure.",The Notebook

I bought the film on DVD and watched it all the way through.This film made me feel happy and warm, mainly because of the time it was set where people could go to the lake and swim and play instead of now where people sit on the Xbox for the weekend. It shows how passionate Noah is about young Allie and what he is willing to do, just to hold her (in the beginning of the film) Ryan Gosling played a well-done part as playing shy and quiet Noah whilst Rachel McAdams was sweet childlike Allie. After i watched the film i cried for hours on end to the point where my eyes were fully swollen, it is a film that i cannot stop talking about and would recommend it to anyone to watch! I think that their story reminds me of how real love is supposed to be. The fact that Noah is rather good looking exaggerates the emotion of sadness.

I was exactly the type that would lay in the street and watch stop lights, just because of the fact that no one else does it. There is no reason for it, except that you are young. I got that part. What touched me the most was the love between the older Noha and Allie, and they are the ones that brought me to tears. To me, the story seems like it didn't have to be anymore than it was, it was supposed to be a story about someone's lives, the story of their life, and to them, it was important enough, it was special enough that they would do anything to relive it.. It was a story of young love, maturity, and true love that never dies. In my opinion, acted out very well by all. I loved all the characters in this movie.

Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, playing the young Allie and Noah, were incredible. You could feel the love between them. I think the most poignant scene in the movie was when they came home late and her parents had her in one room and Noah was left in another room. His facial expressions while listening to the conversation in the adjoining room told more than any words could begin to say. You could feel his hurt and see his love. Gena Rowlands and James Garner were also outstanding. This is a real tearjerker, and gives us the opportunity to see a beautiful love story and how cruel and terrible the ""A"" disease really is.

I did not see the point in adding the character of Martha Shaw, or a scene in Charleston, though. I thought the casting and acting was superb. James Garner was fantastic as Duke, the role fit him perfectly. I always enjoy Garner in a compassionate role such as this one. Gena Rowland also did a fine job as Allie Hamilton. Rachel McAdams blew me away with her performance. I had seen her in Mean Girls and Hot Chick, and was a bit skeptical, but she did an awesome job. Ryan Gosling's acting was also done well, just as he did in Murder by Numbers and Remember the Titans. The music was beautiful, and added much to the film. The plot, though somewhat predictable, is still a beautiful love-story that is actually based off of Nicholas Sparks' In-Laws. A true romantic gem. A must-see for all hopeless romantics, and those in need of a good cry.",The Notebook
859,robyn-engstrom,"A beautiful, tear-jerking romance.",9,2 March 2012,"First off I am a girl and before we go getting stereotypical and sexist I too love all those action-packed thrills, complicated plot twists and dramatic narratives that films, unlike 'The Notebook', will provide you with, so I can appreciate a good movie. However if a tear-jerking Romantic movie comes along I will watch it and thoroughly enjoy it.And a tear-jerking movie this is. The Notebook is the only film that has left me sobbing at the screen. It is both uplifting and imposing.The plot is honestly beautiful and although this is a romantic film there is something very special about it, something that cannot be expressed through this review, you NEED to go and watch this film to understand it's uniqueness. My only criticism is that I would've liked to have seen more of the historical context behind the film, but I guess the genre doesn't allow it so I can't really complain.I dare you not to feel any sort of emotion for this film. Definitely in my top ten films to watch.",The Notebook
860,standinstrong10,:'(,10,4 July 2004,"I knew from the previews that I was going to like the movie a lot, and I did. It was honestly just a great love story. Nicholas Sparks is a great writer, and the I didn't the movie would do it the book justice, but it was nice. The one thing that really turned me off was the interruptions of the present-day couple. I think it would have been better if the story wasn't interrupted because, it kind of brings you back to reality and it doesn't... flow. But, I did like the ending, so it wasn't so bad. The whole movie is just really great. The actors really did a great job with their characters. They really made me... feel what they felt. It was great!",The Notebook
861,lara-sanchez,Heartwrenching but romantic,10,2 April 2012,"The Notebook is a movie you must see if you haven't already. I've always been a fan of romantic movies but never has one made me cry until now.I never thought a movie could make me cry but boy was I wrong!I just love the relationship between Ally and Noah and as you get more into the story it just makes you hope you find a love like the one they shared.I think every girl now after seeing this movie is waiting for her Noah,who wouldn't!The acting in this movie is great,a big thumbs up to Rachel and Ryan, who became big stars after this.That chemistry the two of them shared is real too!As you watch the movie you would think you weren't just watching the character's falling love but also the actors. But of course who could forget Gena Rowlands and James Garner who were so great and very touching in there portrays of the older Ally and Noah so heartbreaking!I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody who believes in love at first sight, and enduring love!",The Notebook
862,Majesta,I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!,10,22 June 2004,"I saw a sneak preview of the Notebook with my girlfriends and we CRIED!!! It was soooo great and the setting and time period just make the movie even more romantic and believable. I truly and highly suggest this film for anyone who loves love stories. Warning: you will cry! But it is mostly a happy cry which is good. Ryan Gosling is extremely good looking and very good as the young Noah Calhoun and Rachel McAdams simply steals the camera's attention. Lastly, I read the novel by Nicolas Sparks and I really think that the filmmakers have done a really good job adapting the film from the novel. If anything the film answers questions left open from the book and the book answers questions left open from the film. So I suggest both the novel and the film (and consequently in that order as well). And of course Joan Allen and the actor who plays Noah's dad are excellent actors who play their role excellently. Highly suggest this film for a girls night out!",The Notebook

Everyone in the cast was perfect. It wouldn't surprise me if there were some Oscars nods from this for some people. Although some stuff was a bit predictable, it didn't matter because it pulled on ur heartstrings the whole time. I was bawling at the end, along with everyone else in the theater. I recommend it to everyone! Ill definitely be going to see it again. There a hasn't been a good, true, get to ya love story like this in ages, at least i think so, but this one gets to ya. Go see it!

Gives me something to do here in the middle of Canada where its dry and boring. This movie was so great. I couldn't believe it would touch me in all aspects. It had the right mix of laughter, sadness, love, excitement and everything else all in one. It wasn't sappy through the whole thing, the two characters showed so much about there character that you could actually see them falling in love on screen. By the end of the movie you are so wrapped up in the movie that you want to go back to the theater and see it all over again. I can't believe the movie has only made 43 million. What a shame more people havn't gone to it.I am a male and I can tell everyone else that this isn't what most refer to as a ""chick flick"". It a movie everyone should see. It shows realities of youth, love, and old age. May love stand the test of time.",The Notebook

I absolutely loved it. I thought that Rachel McAdams was absolutely great in this movie. There really seemed to be chemistry between her and Ryan Gosling. This movie is for anyone who truly loves a good romance movie. If you haven't seen it yet you should definitely make some time to see it. I thought that the cast was perfect for this film. There were also very amazing camera shots. As soon as I came out of the theatre my friends and I wanted to go right back in and see it again. I believe that The Notebook is one of the best romantic films that I have seen in a very long time.

866,TXsweetheart21,GO SEE IT!!,10,25 June 2004,"This movie is by far the best I've seen all year. Maybe because I finally had a good cry, or maybe it's because it paralleled real-life situations. I worked as a C.N.A. and saw many elderly residents who suffered from Alzheimers and dementia. One couple even had to be separated. The husband had dementia and had to be moved to a nursing home. He often asked about his wife. He was very confused. These diseases are horrible, not only for the afflicted, but also for their loved ones. This movie was an excellent portrayal of what sometimes happens to the elderly. It also showed their lives in happier times, such as fun-loving, youths. I thought it was a great movie. But be warned, you might actually be moved to tears. Go see it!",The Notebook
867,ocleveland3,"Thanks, but no thanks.",4,18 April 2012,"Although this movie has accrued much acclaim by critics and fans alike since its release, it has yielded no positive impact on the world of film or society in general. It has led a generation of young women to believe that there is a Noah for all of us, and we deserve to be just as ""misunderstood and rebellious"" as Allie. ""The Notebook"", along with other popular rom-coms, has left most girls with a muddled line between fiction and reality. Though Nicholas Sparks may be talented as a fiction writer, it is only because he knows how to manipulate the female mind into an emotional puddle. Aside from the beautiful Southern setting (a Sparks trademark) and Ryan Gosling occasionally sweaty and shirtless, this movie provided not only no relatability for me, but also did not provide even a fictitious escape.",The Notebook

Now, after watching this movie i still couldn't get out of the mood this movie creates.It's awesome!!!! Never have I seen such a beautiful romance on screen. The chemistry between the lead actors be it Ryan and Rachel or Garner and Gena is absolutely stunning. It's requisite for any romantic-drama to connect with the viewer to make an impression and this movie does it so well. The lead actors make us laugh and cry at their will.I'll give a perfect 10/10 for this movie. If you ever wish to see a romantic movie that would kindle the romance within you, go for this one.",The Notebook
869,anglin03,The Love Story of Our Generation,10,29 April 2012,"The Notebook is a movie based on the best-selling novel by Nicholas Sparks. The movie is about Noah Calhoun (James Garner) visiting a female (Gena Rowlands) living at the assisted living home that he is also a resident of. He connects with her daily by reading an old, tattered notebook that tells the incredible journey of a young couple (played by Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams) and their journey of love and loss. The story starts as a summer romance and takes you through them falling in love and then being torn apart by unapproving parents. From then on their lives took incredibly different paths. His life leads him into World War II and hers takes her through more of a privileged life of going to college and becoming a nurse for the injured soldiers of the war. They are separated for many years until fate appears to step in and bring the young man back to his hometown where he puts everything he has into restoring an old farm house. The young woman preparing for her future finds herself longing to go back to the town where she spent that incredible summer. They both then find themselves torn between their past and their futures unable to resist the temptation of a second chance. The movie is definitely one for the record books as one of the great love stories of our generation.",The Notebook

There is something emotional in this particular movie that we men don't and will never understand. It's nature.Today, I have seen two movies. One is Titanic (for the third time) and second one is The Notebook. I was surprised to note that IMDb rating for Titanic is 7.5 whereas The Notebook is 7.9 out of 10.

I actually watched this movie by accident -- renting another film I loaded the CD without looking -- Just when I realized it was not the film I was expecting -- I saw James Garner and Gina Rowlands were staring so I sat back down and truly had my best movie experience in years. Ryan Gosling is perfectly cast as the handsome, shy young Noha as is Rachael McAdams as the beautiful Alli. James Garner and Gina Rowlands just seem to get better with time.

The characters are down to earth, the setting is realistic and the actual romance is believable! Its these things that make it feel personal and real. The actors and actresses aren't glamorised or airbrushed and the actual acting is brilliant because the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams is so amazing.

873,joshbis,exploding cliché,2,14 June 2004,"pick a romantic movie cliché -- you'll probably find it in The Notebook. It's unintentionally funny with it's unbelievably overly sentimental take on almost everything (including mental illness -- fun!). There is a scene that would be frightening to anyone who has ever encountered waterfowl, but instead feeding the freakish mass of white ducks is played as supremely romantic.The acting was o.k., it was really the plot and the unsustainable narrative structure that really killed the movie.This was the opening film of the Seattle International Film Festival. I'm guessing that it was selected to be completely inoffensive to corporate sponsors. As long as the big donors don't care about innovative or interesting films, the selection may have been a success. At least it provided some laughs and a very low bar for the rest of the festival (which was otherwise well programmed).",The Notebook

Whenever there's a movie about a bestseller, the reader is almost always disappointed (it happened to me with Message in a Bottle). But in this case, the film was just as wonderful as the book, it made me cry just as much, and my husband was just as touched as I was without even reading the book first.

The remaining cast members delighted me with their performances as well. You witness the seeds being planted in the beginning of the story. We, as viewers, are lucky to see the love of Noah & Allie blossom into an enormous rose garden. You can feel along with them, how full, their hearts are. >From the opening scene, until the very last, the cinematography is splendidly vivid, amazingly alive, & meaningful. We get a glimpse of how it is like to live with a partner with Alzheimer's Disease, in the scenes with the adult Noah & Allie, played by James Garner & Gena Rowlands. This is how Nancy Reagan lived with Ronald Reagan, the last few years of his life--she loved him forever. I enjoyed seeing true love prevail over power, prestige, & wealth.

880,binnydeman,Summary,10,15 February 2013,"OK I am a guy and I absolutely loved this movie. I have never even met a person who just said this movie plain out sucked, because it is so genuine and amazing. The Notebook is the one romance I will actually gladly sit through. I sort of saw it with my sisters and mother as a young boy, but only remember the ""barn scene"", which happened due to natural reasons. However, after my friend convinced me to see this I was elated that I did. The movie is the perfect resemblance of young and first love, it is genuine and something incredibly special. Most summer romance are intimate, hot, exciting, and gleeful, however, they always lack enough time. I myself had a romance like this and many other have as well. It is a beautiful time, the sun is shining people are smiling and you're feeling in the moment. The Notebook is the perfect resemblance of what everyone once felt enjoying their summer romances. The effect of Allie's and Noah's rendezvous is incredible. Event hough, most people will not continue these summer romances or even see those people they have a special place in our hearts. Noah and Allie were the perfect actors, this movie pushed their careers into the great state they are in currently, which is especially true for Ryan Gosling. One of the reasons why Gosling's and McAdams's love explodes off the screen is because of their actual relationship outside of the movie. The vintage scenes with the cars, cinema, WWII, etc.. make this movie for me even a little bit better. It happens today, as well, but back then relationships were based on romance and pure craziness about two people, today it seems to be all about the sexual pleasures. The intermitting scenes with the old people house and Noah's and Allie's young lives build a beautiful connection and the last few scenes with lines such as, ""Our love can do miracles"", and ""I'll be seeing you"" are the first time since the Lion King and the Pokemon movie as a little kid that I almost cried. The Notebook is not the best movie ever because the acting wasn't Inception, Batman, or Shawshank Redemption like. However, this is the most genuine movie I have ever seen. Even as a guy living in a sex oriented world, I appreciate true love and long for such moments and connection as Allie and Noah shared. It also does not have the same story line as every chick-flick, but has something special to it. The Notebook is a wonderful movie, the best of its kind.",The Notebook

It's a love story set in the 1940's of a rich girl who meets a guy of humble means and they fall in love. From a nursing home the story of the young couple is being read out of a notebook and captured on screen by flashbacks. James Garner plays Duke who is reading out of the notebook to another resident of the home, Gena Rowlands. Of course there are the ups and downs of the rich family and their disapproval of the young man. This is a very heartwarming love story and will appeal mostly to females.

Not only was this movie filmed in such a beautiful location but the people chosen to act these roles filled the shoes of each character perfectly. I can't believe how quickly James Garner moved me to tears and how many! There was not a dry eye in the house and many of us sat still for quite some time before getting up.

My first impression during the opening was On Golden Pond, then a little Fried Green Tomatoes. But I was surprised by the storyline and impressed by the acting.The beginning of the main character's romance is so believable you forget it's a movie you're watching and not home videos of your grandparents' first date.

It tells the story in past tense, which is kinda dumb, until the end when you finally understand. It is classic poor, hardworking guy, and rich, very educated girl romance, but everything isn't just smooth and great. There are a lot of twists, for a love story, and it all works out to be just how you want. This is the perfect movie to take you wife, girlfriend, mom, or even some guys too.

888,downinnewyork,Sleeper hit of the summer.,9,15 June 2004,"Surprisingly (or not), I saw this movie like everyone else and his uncle--at a sneak preview on Saturday, June 12th. Why didn't they just release it then instead of the 25th? But, I digressI'd read The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks a few years ago and frankly, I hated it. There was nothing wrong with the story itself but sentence structure and Sparks' use of metaphors were (I thought) simplistic and clichéd, and the characters never really got into my head. I didn't finish it, just skipped to the end to see who she chose and that was thatSo suffice it to say, I didn't have the best of expectations for the film, and was really only tuning in to see just what else Ryan Gosling is capable of. He's a genuinely interesting actor who has done some exceptional independent films (think 2001's The Believer and 2002's The Slaughter Rule, my personal favourites) but here he is starring in a film by Nick Cassavetes of A Walk to Remember fame. I'll get to that in a minute.The film opens to a shot of a man rowing across a lake at dusk in silhouette. It's a gorgeous scene marred only by the lazy swooping of a flock of swans that were clearly, painfully computer-generated, and made me wonder what I was in for. Thankfully, I soon forgot about them and lost myself in the love story. Overall, beautiful cinematography.I won't get into details of the plot except to say that it includes some of the most romantic ideas ever put to screen, most of which were taken from the pages of the book, and very easily could have been unadulterated sentimental cheese if it weren't for the cast. Someone, somewhere, got it right when they cast Rachel McAdams opposite Ryan Gosling as the young Allie Hamilton and Noah Calhoun. These two have chemistry like hasn't been seen on-screen in the last 10-15 years and are far and away the best reason to see the film. Together they're intoxicating, three days later, I still can't get them out of my head. Their work is equally unpredictable, exciting and sincere, and it gives the film instant credibility.Gena Rowlands and James Garner are legendary in their own rights, making excellent use of what comparatively little screen time they have, and it is their scenes that really pack an emotional punch. James Garner has one moment in particular that just wrecked me. I was curious as to how they would create the scene where Allie remembers again and, surpassing all of my wildest expectations, it remains the only scene in the film that made me cry (as opposed to just giving me a lump in my throat), including the ending.I couldn't help but wish that James Garner had tried to mimic Ryan Gosling's mannerisms, speech patterns and body language because I didn't really feel that they were playing the same character. It's easily acceptable though--if I were of his stature, I wouldn't make a movie just to do an impression of an up-and-comer either. The Notebook also boasts arguably the *worst* war scene since EVERY war scene in Windtalkers, and I think the filmmakers could have increased the tension surrounding Allie's decision between Noah and Lon (James Marsden, under-utilized with only about 10 minutes of screen time).Undoubtedly, there will be people who have nothing good to say about The Notebook because they detest love stories and are unable to understand why it will connect with a mostly female audience. They'll argue that love like Noah and Allie's doesn't exist in the real world--and for the most part, it doesn't. But when I watched this movie, I saw my boyfriend countless times in Noah, and I believe (even while I cringe at how corny this sounds) that there isn't a couple out there that can't find something to identify with too. That's why the whole Movie Love argument isn't valid here--there may *not* be one couple that ever existed in the history of time exactly like them, but they do exist, in their totality, through the 6 billion people on Earth. You can't argue with that.After the screening, I watched the girl sitting in front of me lean over and give her boyfriend a kiss that spoke volumes. The Notebook made me want to run right home and give my boyfriend the biggest hug ever (and them some), so frankly, most men will not regret seeing this film if asked to by their girlfriends, and I think we all know what I mean. ;)The one thing The Notebook really made me aware of though was my grandparents, and the countless other couples going through similar circumstances. To lose your memories, and forget everything that means anything to you is terrible, both for you and those who love you. The ending of The Notebook may be really corny, there's no denying it, but it certainly is a nice thought, to be able to make someone remember and to not be alone in the end. This movie is going to be the sleeper hit of the summer. No magic wands, no spiders, and certainly no trolls. I'm going to see it again when it opens on June 25th, and I'll be first in line for the DVD (though I probably won't be reading the book again).**** out of 5 stars, if only for the war scene, and a little James Marsden is always a good thing.",The Notebook

Joy, sadness, anger; it truly tugged on my heartstrings.The Acting was so well done, I truly believed that Rachel Mcadams (Allie) and Ryan Gosling (Noah) were a couple. The chemistry was definitely there. It was also so wonderful to see James Garner again, he is such a great actor, he makes it look so easy. And last but not least Gena Rowlands. I don't think I could have picked a better actor for her role.Everything was breathtaking, the visuals, the score, the direction, the acting. To say in the least the whole movie was breathtaking.Bring tissues; men and women of all ages leaving the theatre were weeping. How could just a mediocre movie do that? Well a mediocre movie didn't, an exquisite one did.",The Notebook
890,kelsnscott2,An intimate and engrossing love story,10,19 June 2004,"After reading the book I was sure that my review of the film would be slightly skewed due to the fact that I had read the book two days before the sneak preview. Of course, I was wrong. My reactions of and during the film were the same of two friends who came along. Spark's story has brought forth a romance film so desperately needed during a season of body bronzer and car chases. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams prove to be a breath of fresh air next to films with stars who are true staples of box-office success. Gosling, who has usually leaned towards complex characters like a Jewish neo-Nazi in ""The Believer"" and a teen guilty of homicide in ""Murder by Numbers"" proves that he can more than hold his own in completely foreign film territory: romance. In a very Julianne Moore way, he has the power to convey pages of dialogue through simple looks and is surprisingly talented at finding comedy in certain lines and carries it off with a sort of accidental charm. Rachel McAdams, most known for her recent role as a teen queen in ""Mean Girls"" gives a truly charismatic performance and establishes a both multi-dimensional and personal character, which makes the viewer thankful that she beat out the likes of Britney Spears for the role.All in all, Nicolas Sparks has provided summer movie-goers with a lovely story about first, enduring, and everlasting love.",The Notebook
891,earthsavers13,True love- a rare thing with the shown intensity,10,16 February 2005,"The movie was absolutely phenomenal to only be topped by Phantom of the Opera. It was so amazingly adorable how they originally met- the cuts back to present time as Noah and Ally are 70 year-old portraying the strength of true love even though the mind may wander to unknown places. I cried along with (Noah) James Garner when Ally had to be sedated but was even more in tune with him than ever at that point. He patiently waits for her mind to return occasionally and for a short amount of time. The funny thing is that one cannot find that kind of love as often as it used to be. In the movie, there is an actual courtship before the first date with the tug of war game going on between Noah and Ally romantically. If only I could find that same intensity of feelings- and to top that off, this summer romance took place when they were both 17- as am I. A perfect time to start such a thing. Although I must say that my favorite scene or rather scenes take place when the rainstorm comes barreling through and they ""fall"" for each other again along with the scene of the young love courtship. And nothing beats the scene with Noah's dad telling stories of when Noah was younger. So cute and adorable in every way! Noah (Ryan Gosling) is without a doubt my forever and always leading man!",The Notebook
892,tiffanyholbert,Originally rated this movie a 10 when I watched it as a teen. Now..,1,12 October 2020,"Having just rewatched it as a (somewhat) mature adult, I give it a 1. I got a bit farther than the part where Noah basically threatens to kill himself if Allie doesn't go out with him. It's like they were aiming for Noah to have this Jack Dawson level of adventurous ""bad boy"" cheek to him and it doesn't work.Watching this movie feels like being asked to root for a super toxic relationship, and to think it's romantic when it really isn't.",The Notebook
893,heatherstar314,Absolutely Amazing,10,24 June 2004,"This movie is absolutely amazing. I can't say enough about this movie. It was just beautiful. The love that these two shared is indescribable. The Notebook is moving and actually quite funny. There wasn't a dry eye in the theater. Mostguys believe that is is a ""chick flick"" or that only older people will like this movie, but there were many men moved to tears including my own husband and weloved this movie and we are in our early 20's. If you have ever been in love than this movie will move you to tears, so bring lots of tissue! I plan on seeing it again in just a few days and I am positive that I will be at the theater to see it again and again. I am just so in love with this movie. I highly recommend this movie to EVERYONE!!!",The Notebook

If you want to make her fall in love with you again, take her here.Don't be fooled. This movie will take the most stout of you guys and tear your heart out. Everyone in the theater the first time had a hard time not crying their eyes out as they left. The storyline is well laid out. The movie doesn't leave anything hanging in the balance. You don't leave the theater with any ""What happened to ..."" questions. Well worth the time spent.Definitely one to add to the DVD collection when it's released.",The Notebook
895,kristen-deardorff,Compelling and compassionate love story!,9,25 June 2004,"I thought this movie was heart warming along with many emotional issues that viewers can relate too. This movie will touch your heart. The passion that these two characters portray together is hardly describable. The emotion of these characters not only show how love conquers all but how powerful love truly is. This movie makes you laugh and cry all at the same time. This love story should be an example of how two people who truly love each other stay together through the test of time. Along with adversity, Noah and Ali find some way to hold on to their feelings despite their circumstances. These two battle through tough times and issues that most people do in real life. This is why, this movie is remarkable! If you have any interest, or want to see a great love story then I definitely recommend seeing the notebook! Prepare yourself you will cry!",The Notebook
896,emilyjean18,Absolutely Amazing...a must see!,10,25 June 2004,"This movie truly was one of the greatest love stories of all time! (as over rated as that sounds). It far exceeded my expectations of a cute girly movie. I went into it expecting another sappy love movie, but it the ultimate story of ever lasting love. If you have ever been in love, this movie will move you in a way you never thought possible. IT was refreshing to see a love that was so strong and so prevailing. It was a beautiful story and the actors (especially ryan gosling and James garner) displayed an outstanding performance. I just can't say enough good about it! Inspiring, amazing, and emotional-that sums it up pretty nicely. If you haven't seen it, GO! My rating: 10/10",The Notebook

Lately, the film industry has been lacking the sort of element that I love to see in a movie. The last movie I saw that made me cry as much as ""The Notebook"" did was ""Ghost"" with Demi Moore. The casting of Allie and Noah in the movie was exceptional and made the feelings and emotions seem real. After watching the movie in the theater, I noticed every person, including the men, cry as they left the theater. Now when was the last time you saw anything like that?? I bought the movie on DVD the day it came out and have been watching it everday since that day!! I would highly recommend this movie to both males and females.",The Notebook
898,aurora38,A love like that...,10,26 June 2004,"""The Notebook"" is one of those movies that give others hope that someday they will find a love like that. Every person dreams of having love that will stand the test of time. This movie gave me a preview of what my life will be like down the road. I read the book before hand, but still found myself crying throughout the movie. It was deeply touching. Each actor did a fabulous job. While reading the book, I had an image of what the actors would look like and the movie hit each one of them on the head! I wish that things in that time were still today, were the simple things are the most important in life. The movie also captured the book very well. This movie is by far my favorite of all time and I can't wait to see it again.",The Notebook
899,FoRgIvEnO3,We can all relate to something.....this is just heart warming...,10,26 June 2004,"This is positively, hands down the best romance/drama of the year. This film will uplift you and move you in ways that you have never been moved. I...I am still teary eyed about it and its been 3 hours since I've seen it. I have never been touched the way that movie touched me, I mean with all the terror, horror, and evil movies out these days this is definitely something we all need. It's real. It's something we can all relate to. A lot of us have had first loves and coincidentally sometimes they become our only loves. This movie has so much passion it is....breathtaking. I mean not a lot of us have suffered from a chainsaw massacre, but whether we realize it or not, we've all loved someone. Anyhow, its without a doubt worth three hours. I think its worth nine. But its the best film I have seen in my whole life. A film that will move the world and stick with us forever.",The Notebook
900,erikajane200,Best Love story I have Seen!!!!,10,27 June 2004,"I loved this movie. It was great!!!!! At the end of the movie everyone in the theater was crying, even the guys. When the credits came up, everyone laughed cuz we all knew that there wasn't a dry eye in the room. Mascara ran down faces, and eyes were very red. It's hard to believe that a guy would cry over a chik flik, but that just shows how great of a movie this was. It was an exceptionally great movie, and I can't wait until it comes out so I can buy it. Very great acting to all of the characters, especially to Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams! If you haven't seen it,I insist that you do. I haven't seen a movie this great in a long time. It is now my favorite movie!!!!",The Notebook
901,rosey_003,WOW!,10,27 June 2004,"Wow! That is all I can say about this movie! I have yet to cry when I am watching a movie (I say yet to, because I have not seen ""The Passion of the Christ."") But this movie had me very close to tears at the very end of it. The guy I went to see it with, was almost crying as well. I loved the movie! Ryan Gosling, was great! I loved him in ""Remember the Titans."" He is also very good looking. The reviews that I have read, said that James Garner and Gena Rowlands could not pull off their parts. But, they did a GREAT job! I think, that they held the story together, in the present day. James Marsden was also a good person to be in the movie. I have watched him grow up (so to speak) because I saw one of his first movies, which is ""No Dessert Dad, Til You Mow the Lawn"" and that was really good. Rachel McAdams, was also very good. I could not believe that it was the same person from ""Mean Girls."" Just because the parts were so different.",The Notebook
902,khariza23,Great movie!,10,27 June 2004,"The Notebook is a really great film. It is very touching and has a wonderful story. You will really fall in love with this film like i have if you enjoy romantic/drama movies. I think that Ryan & Rachel had a lot of chemistry in the film. It was very obvious they both were great for their parts. I think films that take place in the present, but have a bigger story relating to the past are really interesting, like this one. The Notebook for me, seems like a movie i would enjoy watching over and over not getting tired of seeing it. Many parts would make you want to just cry, like i did. :P. Anyways, if you haven't considered adding this movie to your summer movie list, i suggest you reconsider because i believe that this movie is really worth watching.",The Notebook
903,VicmacsDR,The kind of love you wish you can find,10,26 February 2005,"In my movie going experience, very few movies have the sensitive value of this film, not going into the beauty of the sceneries and the fine costumes that are very well fit to the time and place, The Notebook has that tingle you don't expect but always want from a love story it's a simple love, pure and fresh, torn at some point, difficult at another, with its ups and downs but plain perfect when one looks at it in retrospect.The kind of love that very few find, the kind of love everybody wishes they had, excellent direction, no lingering points, keeps you guessing at some points, but in the end it all adds up, and the feeling you will get after you watch it, hopefully with that special someone, will make the bond even stronger, because it is more than a good movie, it's a shadow of hope, of a time that's gone but can still be found, The Notebook is a see to feel. So go and feel it. It's great.I cried so I give it a perfect 10. Thank you for making this film.",The Notebook
904,squiggle-4,The Notebook from a Guys Perspective,9,29 June 2004,"So you know where this is coming from: I'm a white collar, educated type who lives the basics of beer and (American) football as well as good wine and Shakespere... on the lower cusp of middle age, who spends more time listening to ESPN Radio and playing softball, volleyball, and (in the) gym than parked in front of the TV or nose in a book (although I always have a couple of books in progress). That should do...Having not read Sparks book (and I acknowledge that the book is always better than the movie) I can honestly say that I would NEVER have seen this movie if not dragged there by my other half. Sparks is her favorite author, and the Notebook, apparently, her favorite novel of the many he has spawned. Nor is this the first Sparks adaptation I have been forced to watch... even the supreme talent of one of my favorite actors (and human beings) Paul Newman could not save the awful Message In Bottle (Costner's horrible acting does a lot to cancel Newman's effect). I digress...I have often been a fan of framed stories. When well done, it can add complexity and mystery to a flat subject like the basic romance, which as a guy, I have felt like I have been exposed to the same awful tripe 100 times too many (see any movie with J. Lo. in it <wretch>). Sparks and Cassevetes accomplish this, heightening your curiosity and raising a level of suspense not found in most tearjerkers. Without the frame, The Notebook would have been boring and predictable. With the talent of James Garner (who I would give a nod to for Best Supporting Actor for his work in this film) narrating the reading of the inner story and acting the frame, everything changes. I was thoroughly engaged in the timeline from here to there and back, cared about the characters, and despite my manliest effort, could not fight back the tears in the end. Even the tough looking African American marine sitting next to me was wiping at his eyes during Garner's incredibly powerful scene with Rowlands as she recovers her memory for a few moments before falling back into the abyss of (Alzheimer's?). And of course, the ending, which I understand was changed substantially from the book... there was not a dry eye in the sold out theater. Only a goofy sob from a female member of the crowd was able to change the moment enough for me to wipe away the tears and have a chuckle.If I can find the time, which I doubt, I may pluck the book off a the shelf at home and give it a try. I recommend any movie to others that has enough of an effect on me to still be thinking about it 24 hours later.Guys, take your woman. She will be incredibly emotional and the movie is eminently watchable. If you have a heart at all, you will have to go to great lengths to keep the moisture from leaking out of your head.",The Notebook
905,pgowin,A must see movie...,10,29 June 2004,"I must admit, after having read the book twice, I was a bit doubtful that the movie could do it justice. I was not at all disappointed in it though. It was an excellent movie. You see the characters, not the actors portraying them. I do not think there was a dry eye in the place last night when we saw it. It is on my list to purchase as soon as it comes out on DVD.The casting is excellent, as I cannot picture anyone else portraying any of these characters now. Costuming was awesome. I definitely recommend this one to anyone who likes a good love story. Being a fan of the author, I look forward to anything else they put to the big screen. It is hard to put into words, but the movie was just as it should have been. There was never a moment in this movie that was used as a time filler. The interweaving of present day and past was an integral part of the story and it was done very effectively. I highly suggest you see this one!",The Notebook
906,rebeccabryan622,Outstanding story of true love...,10,29 June 2004,"I have to say that the second I saw the previews for it, I had to go out and see it. I will admit, I am that sappy girl who cries at just about every movie ever made and who loves a good romance, but this one was more than just a romance. It was a story of how true love never dies, no matter what the circumstances are.I bought the book when I heard that this movie was coming out and I read it in two days. I couldn't put it down. I finally got to see the movie today and let me tell you, it did nothing to diminish what the book made for me. Most of the time, when a movie is made from a book, the movie follows nothing in the book. But this movie does. The story line, while somewhat different, is very much the same. I want to seriously say how amazing Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, and the rest of the cast did, bringing these characters to life.If I were you, I would run out and see this movie right now with that special someone.",The Notebook
907,Sk8erkisses69,BEST,10,29 June 2004,"This movie was a fantastic movie that showed how some relationships turn out. They fight one minute and the next they are in love with each other again. This movie shows how every girl wants to end up, in love with the one that loves her the most and will take care of her without no money involved. Nicholas Sparks is a great author and most of his books come out appealing to all readers. It shows that he is a nice guy that could possibly have seen or been through what he wrote. The director did an excellent job. This film is a movie that most women are going to look forward to on DVD. This film makes you cry, be happy, and even wonder if there are any guys like ""Noah"" out there. I loved this movie and I gave it a 10.",The Notebook
908,crgere,A lesson the entire world needs to learn,10,29 June 2004,"This film has the ability to change the world by changing the way people live their lives. If more of us were this committed to our relationships, loved without superficiality, and pursued our goals with such devotion, the divorce rate would be much lower and the world would still be a decent place to live as it was long ago. In today's society we are consumed with materialistic things and insecure enough to be influenced by what others think we should or shouldn't do. The reason ""The Notebook's"" impact on me was so profound is because it does not sugar coat true love in a way that misleads viewers into thinking that a relationship with one's soulmate is without its share of rough spots. It is realistic in the way that it portrays two lovers who quarrel and have difficult obstacles to overcome in order to stay together. The film openly admits that it takes work every day to make a relationship a success. Unfortunately, we live in a world dictated by convenience, therefore, the minute our relationships require extra work we give up because we'd rather look for someone else who has a lower set of standards that are easier to meet. In closing, I would like to say that Noah & Allie serve as an example that we should all aspire to.",The Notebook

I'm glad they picked her she did a good job. I just hope that i don't read somewhere that she and ryan are now an item, i would be so jealous!!!! But i wouldn't be surprised, those kisses were really steamy!! I am going to see the movie for a second time tonight, i cant wait.

911,buffling1,The best movie!,10,4 July 2004,"I am now obsessed with this movie...unbelievable. The acting was insane- it was SO GREAT! The chemistry between the characters was incredibly intense, and I found myself falling in love with them both. The characters had a lot of depth, making the love story all the more resonating. I hate to think that this film could be characterized as a ""chick flick."" Yes, it is a love story, but Noah is a ""man's man"", albeit one with an intense passion for his first true love (something I would hope most men could relate to). Not to get preachy, but this film left me with a sort of sadness for the present era of ""wham bam thank you ma'm"" culture we live in. I pine for a time when it was considered ""normal"" to actually get to know the one you will sleep with-thus, allowing people to actually fall in love on a *variety* of levels (and allowing the immense respect to build as it did with these characters). I so love the relationship between Noah and Allie. I am happily single, and would live quite contently to live as a free bachelorette. I won't compromise myself by getting into a relationship where the commitment to love and respect one another is anything less than 100%. I'd be much happier single. To all of those in my position I say set this film up as your model of what a relationship should be-don't settle for anything less. Yes, it is a work of fiction but it is based on a real couple (the author's wife's parents), and it could be based on my grandparent's/aunt and uncle's relationship. In other words, it is not an unrealistic goal to set up for yourself. Okay, I have rambled long enough but, in closing, let me just say that this movie does what only the most legendary films are capable of doing-it stays with you and causes you to internalize it for use in the betterment of your own life. Love, love, LOVE IT!!!!!!!",The Notebook

I saw it Saturday with a friend and we cried together in the solid last 10 minuets almost... I have never cried before in a movie theater yet this had to be on of the best movies I have seen,.. I personally can't wait for it to come out on video so I can see it again!! I also can't wait to read the book... I think that even though it is over 2hours long those 2hours were used very good... if you havn't seen it yet you should. I get a magazine and they rated the movie as a c+ and I can t possibly understand why....It is definitely a good movie... you can always go to the official web sites and see trailers. It a romantic story about two different people in two different classes that end up falling in love while the odds are against you. Ryan Gosling is Noah and I think does a great job... I definitely suggest everyone see it... and if you don't wanna pay those expensive prices at the movies rent it when it comes out on video....SEE IT!!!",The Notebook

Gosling looks absolutely amazing and McAdams is beautiful. For anyone who hasn't seen a love story that has touched your soul, this is the movie to do it.

The movie's so refreshing because it's very rare to see such a pure, deep, touching, and beautiful love story in Hollywood anymore. This beautiful movie illustrates, plain and simply, soulmates. Ryan Gosling (Noah) and Rachel McAdams (Allie) were the perfect actors for their parts. They had a lot of chemistry, which is necessary in this type of story. I was very impressed by everyone's acting in the movie. James Garner and Gena Rowlands gave very realistic portrayals of older Noah and Allie.

If you love someone then this is a movie to see with that person. It makes you appreciate them more. My boyfriend teared up at the end and I of course cried a lot. I love this movie and I will own it when it comes out. I work at the movie theater so I can see it for free as much as I want. There is so much passion and love in this movie. The love scenes are very romantic and passionate. The last fifteen minutes are the saddest. I was happy but also sad. It also has a few funny parts.

Period. If you do not cry even once throughout this movie, then you must not have a heart. I loved everything about this movie. It was poignant and sometimes funny and should not be missed. Ryan Gosling was excellent at portraying Young Noah Calhoun. He is a great actor and when I came out of the theaters, I ran to buy the book.

Being the disappointment that was hopped on over to Notebook. I was the only guy there initially until other two others showed up with their girl friends. I'm sure the two mothers behind me with their teenaged daughters wondered where my girl friend was and when no one showed up wondered if I was playing for the 'other team.' I'm definitely not but I'm a sucker for feasible story lines and period films, and this one totally rocked.

919,ty4cubs1,A future classic with a very powerful message,9,10 August 2004,"This movie caught my eye before it's release since I am a big fan of Ryan Gosling and Sam Shepard. I figured it would be the common ""girlie relationship movie"", since I have not read the book and I only saw the movie poster. Sure, this movie is somewhat of a ""girlie relationship movie"", but I think that the story is very unique and powerful, and can really make you think about what you really want and care about. I really don't want to get into a summary of the plot and that sort of thing, so if you really want to know what the movie is about, please go see it, or read the novel it is based on. All I can tell you is this movie really can grab you if you allow it to. I really enjoyed watching Gosling and Shepard in this movie, but unfortunately someone else stole the show. Rachel McAdams as Allie. Wow. The idea of this character made me lose my mind. Sure, she did the whole ""play hard to get"" thing in the beginning, but WOW, when she lets her defenses down, the person she turns into was absolutely amazing. You could tell she was head over heels in love, and not with herself. She was completely memorized by another human being that complemented her perfectly, and she did not care how different they were in society's eyes. She loved another with all of her heart, and the one she loved felt the exact same way she did. 3 scenes from this movie really stand out in my mind, and so that I am not ruining the movie for those that have not seen it yet, I will abbreviate: 1. Piano-floor in old house, 2. Wedding dress-newspaper-bathtub scene, and 3. James Garner explaining to his family scene. These 3 scenes are what love should be all about, and nothing less. In conclusion, I don't care if you are a guy or girl, go see this if you haven't yet. It may teach you something in answering this question: Do you follow your heart?",The Notebook
920,candicemarshall,Even the men in the theater were audibly crying...,10,23 July 2004,"James Garner gave an amazing, amazing performance (of course, I have been a James Garner fan for many years). Gena Rowlands played a complex character suffering from dementia...shifting in and out of reality. But the not so surprising performance by Ryan Gosling was AWESOME. I thought he gave a terrific performance in ""By the Numbers"" and just knew we all would be seeing a lot more of him. The entire cast was superb, each giving a performance that came right from the heart. This is such a touching film that may have seemed contrived, predictable...but in the end it wasn't and kept one wondering just how it would end. And the ending was moving, touching and so emotional. I will be telling all of my friends this is a movie that is not to be missed. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!",The Notebook
921,erin1595,The Notebook is FANTASTIC,8,16 November 2012,"From the best-selling novel by Nicholas Sparks this movie, like the book, truly captivates your heart. To those who haven't seen it I hate to sound corny but you must understand this movie makes you cry real tears. The love story is one of a kind. The effect offers something for anyone who has ever been in love, yearned for love, or has two hours to kill on a rainy night. I saw the movie before I read the book and was actually, in this situation, quite pleased because the actors they picked for Allie and Noah were absolutely spot-on and I pictured them as I read the book. Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling are definitely easy on the eyes and their chemistry on screen made you believe that Allie and Noah were head over heels in love with one another. I will go head and answer your question yes , it is a tad mellow-dramatic with a theme of love conquers all, yet you somehow look past the sappy and get hooked into the story. SPOILER ALERT To the ones who have seen this movie, WOAH I know weren't expecting to find out the old couple in the beginning were actually Noah and Allie! I love that surprise attack that just pulled your heart even more. Nicholas Sparks really made me raise my standards! To have a man like Noah as a husband ooh baby sign me up. I really don't see any flaws in this movie what so ever. I do hate the fact that she doesn't remember Noah and her children and their wonderful years together but hey what else do you expect from Nicholas Sparks? He never fails to add that depressing edge. This movie touches on so much. The southern 1940's setting, her parents who are wealthy and want someone for Allie that is of their ""class"", separate Noah and her because he just isn't of their social position, Allie's mother keeping heartfelt letters from Noah away from Allie for a year knowing in her mind that she too once loved a man that worked in construction, and watchers also falling for Lon even though you want Noah in the end because Sparks just strives to keep you on your toes.Now, guys you might be standoff-ish, because this movie is a proclaimed ""chick flick"". But I did watch this with my boyfriend and he thoroughly enjoyed it. Not once did he roll his eyes or fall asleep. I will be the first to say, a guy definitely will have to be in the mood for a slower romantic movie, but he won't regret it after it is over. The Notebook is interesting to watch because of the time period and the fun loving relationship Noah and Allie have and how they find each other after so many years still so in love with one another. It wasn't your typical predictable love story. The twists and turns the ups and down were exhilarating to watch. I could sit down and watch this movie once a week and never once be bored. That's saying a lot for a two hour movie! I know exactly what will happen and the lines out of their mouths but it never fails to make my heart sink when it starts to rain and the booming thunderstorm just sets the tone and  you know the rest. I have spoiled this movie for you if you haven't seen it but like I said I watch it over and over and still cry every time. It is well worth it to watch The Notebook and be taken away for two hours into a magical love story.",The Notebook
922,clancyfrazier,Not-so-typical Love Story,10,16 November 2012,"Every girl dreams of having the perfect romance story to tell to their loved ones. She meets her prince charming, they fall in love and go off and get married. This predictable plot line is repeated in the American media countless times, yet people still go crazy for these types of stories and films. The Notebook is your typical love story yet it comes with a twist at the end. Spoiler alert: it ends the same way every mushy love story does, together forever with an unrealistic setting and the audience dramatically sobbing their eyes out. But hey, isn't that why us women die over great love stories? I'll admit, I am a sucker for these stories as well. This movie makes you feel as though you were flashed back to the early 1940s in North Carolina with the rich and beautiful Allie Hamilton and the poor yet attractive Noah Calhoun. They share an idyllic summer fling that eventually turns into something so much more. The young love grows and endures through countless wars and parent disapproval. The overall plot reflects Romeo and Juliet, but it is presented with fresh and different scenery and exciting charisma that makes the movie not as predictable as one might think. There are two main reasons this movie is truly a good love story. The most important reason is the drop dead gorgeous heartthrob, Noah Calhoun. He will cause all women's hearts to melt. He makes this movie come to life. He is the ideal Prince Charming; strong, smooth, and dashingly handsome. Since this movie is intended for women mainly, he will definitely help reel in viewers. He is easily likable with his humbleness and steady, hardworking hands. He sweeps Allie off her feet, making all the ladies in the audience wish it was them. In my opinion, looking at Noah Calhoun for almost two hours during a movie is definitely worth my time. Another thing that makes this movie so romantic and powerful is the setting. North Carolina is one of the most beautiful, serene settings in the United States. With its natural flowing rivers, classic colonial architecture, and wide open meadows, the setting really does set the mood for falling in love and creating memories, making the movie seem even more magical.The main purpose of this movie was just to entertain an audience, majority of them being female, with a solid, memorable love story. The characters are very likable and it has a lighthearted, uplifting mood that comes along with it. The movie takes you on an emotional roller-coaster that is the ideal love story while still being as realistic as it can be. It is probably my favorite movie due to the fact that it leaves you wanting more when you are sitting there bawling your eyes out at the ending scene. The story is very compelling from the opening scene to the end, and it is a permanent movie in my collection.",The Notebook
923,Emilip05,Awesome Love Story,10,21 February 2005,"I must say that this is one of the best love stories that I have ever heard of. I saw this movie five times in theater, and attempted to buy it the day it was released, however it was sold out. I have watched it six times in TWO days, and I bawl just the same every time (if not more.) It is hard to find love like this in today's world. While watching this movie, it is almost like you fall into it, you forget that you are living in the real world, and you feel like you are a part of these people's lives, you feel as if you are Alli and Noah. In many parts you cry, and in many parts you laugh... you may even get angry a few times, but even after the 11th time you've seen it, it will leave you longing for more, because let's face it folks, we all want a love story so genuine.",The Notebook
924,JustineDavids,Heartfelt Movie,10,10 November 2012,"The movie, ""The Notebook"" was an inspiring movie to that teaches you to peruse the ones you love. The meaningful script and the amazing actors/ actresses. The actors in this movie highlight the meaning in the book that it was based off of. Nicholas Sparks had a detailed description of the characters intended for depicting into the cast that was casted. The great storyline left tears rolling down checks and a longing for a lifelong partner that would stand by you through everything. ""Sometimes we need to be apart to understand just how much we truly love each other,"" is one of the beautiful quotes that shows how strong Ali and Noah's love is for each other. The meaningful script made the connection between Ali and Noah seem unbreakable. Meaningful lines such as the one stated below, force you to think if there is anyone that would ever speak those words to you; if you have so to speak a 'Noah.' Emotional moments like this make you stop and think; to have compassion. """"My Dearest Allie. I couldn't sleep last night because I know that it's over between us. I'm not bitter anymore, because I know that what we had was real. And if in some distant place in the future we see each other in our new lives, I'll smile at you with joy and remember how we spent the summer beneath the trees, learning from each other and growing in love. The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more, that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds, and that's what you've given me. That's what I hope to give to you forever. I love you. I'll be seeing you. Noah,""Although the movie is full of emotion as any chick-flick is, the storyline and compassion behind the words are overwhelming. The thought that one would wait his whole life for one girl is phenomenal. When you decade your whole life to someone when they have moved on is a risky thing to do, but Noah took that risk. It states in the movie that he fixed up the house in hope that Ali would come back to him. Whim less hopes should not be dwelled on, but when they come true, like in the movie, it is all worth while.The great actors made the movie enjoyable to watch. The facial expressions show the compassion that the actors have for the words spoken. The actress that played Ali, Rachel McAdams, and the actor that played Noah, Ryan Gosling, made it seem like they were madly in love. When a movie inspires you to peruse the ones you love, then only love is worth fighting for. When this movie touches you will want to write your own notebook.",The Notebook
925,jkmcgalin,I REALLY liked The Notebook (2004),10,2 August 2004,"The Notebook (2004) is an EXCELLENT movie! I very easily identified with the characters! It took me back to when I was young and first in love with my husband. I was able to totally escape today's world of stress and worries as the plot unfolded. For the duration of the film, I didn't have a care in the world!! I found myself constantly wanting the young couple to make decisions that I would have made! The film was very well made! I would recommend this film to everyone who really likes a heartwarming movie!This is especially great for couples who are very much in love, but can bring other couples closer together in their relationships with each other. I REALLY liked The Notebook (2004)!!",The Notebook
926,starfallprincess1,Spectacular,9,2 August 2004,"I wholeheartedly believe, that with love, all things are possible, and this movie captures that theory without a hitch. Never have I seen such a heartfelt, deep, and romantic love story as The Notebook. The actors were extraordinary. Gosling has this essence about him that draws you in and allows you to share his emotions, McAdams was beautiful and sincere throughout her performance, Garner and Rowlands, well what else could you expect from the two, nothing but the best. The story grabs hold of your heart, the dialogue, the actions, the music, everything invades your soul so deep that you can't look away from the screen, and can't leave the theater without a smile and reassurance that love is by far the greatest, most powerful force in the world that can't be challenged.",The Notebook
927,dramaqueen82,I loved this movie,10,22 August 2004,"i loved this movie. it made me cry really hard at the end. i mean, come on, who wouldn't cry? and OK,it may have been mushy on some parts, but i mean u can't expect a romance movie to not have mushiness in it and if you don't like mushiness just don't go see romances like this. but i personally loved this film because it was such a beautiful film and it wasn't one of those movies that u would just sit back and barely watch it as u wish for it to be over any second. part of the reason i wanted to see this movie was because Rachel McAdams was in it and i had seen rachel mcadams before in mean girls and i wanted to see her act again in a more dramatic, serious roll. i thought she was excellent in mean girls as the lead mean girl Regina, but she was even better here as Allie. i heard they considered Britney Spears for the role. i laughed so hard when i heard that one. i probably would not go see it for the sole reason that Britney was playing lead, only because it would be a worse movie cause Britney can't act a lick. if u don't believe me, rent Crossroads. But all in all, I really really really liked this movie. I give it a 10/10.",The Notebook
928,zliang,what people wished for,9,4 August 2004,"i just have to say that the movie was great. the love relationship between Nova and Allie is the one that everyone would wish for. the kind that will survive through time and trials. although most of us may never find the love as the one in the notebook, but i suppose the hope of finding such love is the reason why we all love it. before i watched this movie, i was pretty depressed about my future because everything seem so uncertain. yet, after i walked out from Tinseltown, i realized that if someone like Nova can spend years in search of Allice, why should i feel so bad about my life simply because some difficulties that can be conquer? after all, finding the true and lasting love relationship is the hardest thing in the world. i encourage all of you who haven't seen it yet to go see it. you'll be glad.",The Notebook
929,Minnie35,Bring your tissues...,1,12 May 2007,"...You may cry out due to complete boredom and instances of sudden outbursts of laughter due to this movie's all-round stupid and unrealistic plot. Just so sad to see two fabulous, classic actors accept supporting roles in a poorly written movie; with countless obvious mistakes, many being historical in nature; from a terrible book.I think if they had a different writing team, different researchers!, and ditched those two awful youth actors (who belong in teen flicks and those stupid giant lizard and shark movies on the Sci-Fi channel), the movie may have been good if the focus was on the late stages of their life and not the early. When they were young, it was all totally unrealistic cloudy rolls in the hay, giant rivers filled with birds and a wet sundress contest and pouty fights. But the roles Gena Rowlands and James Garner were totally different and could really make a wonder movie.The many historical flaws were very distracting. Such as her jewelry styles. The types of pearls a betrothed upper class girl at her age were totally wrong. Also the lack of progression of the fashions through the decade of their youth is wrong especially for someone w/ money.Unusually, I would say read the book, but that was just as bad. My recommendation is watch a different movie! Oh and I SO totally agree with dallas_viewer 's review! This person hit it on the nose! Also kj_justice 's review is spot on except for the Disney comment. Sappy Disney romance is one kind I always love! :-)",The Notebook
930,rbirvin-1,Every woman's perfect love story,10,13 August 2004,"If you enjoyed ""The Thorn Birds"", ""Gone With the Wind"", ""Love Story"", and ""A Star Is Born"", you are bound to enjoy this movie. The story is every woman's heart's desire. The choice may remind the viewer of ""Sophie's Choice."" And if you are a fan of James Garner, you will be so happy to see Maverick/Rockford again in a wonderful role. The story is told in medias res, that is, with flashbacks to bring the viewer to the present. Garner is reading from a notebook to a memory impaired lady. She looks forward to their sessions and he is devoted to reading to her. The story he reads is very special. The pictures painted are beautiful remembrances and artistically presented. Besides a beautiful story, The Notebook is beautiful photographically.",The Notebook

I read the book in one night and absolutely fell in love with it. I was so excited to see the movie when my boyfriend took me for my birthday. I was skeptical because movies are never as good as the books. But I have to say that I fell so deeply in love with the movie as well as I did with the book. I thought all of the main character did a wonderful job portraying their roles, and had great chemistry. Especially Ryan and Rachel. Even though the movie is slightly different then the book, it is unique and special in its own way. I love this movie and I'm sure I will read the book and watch the movie over and over again! it definitely is a tearjerker, so bring some tissue!",The Notebook
932,peachy_avacado,"Bad Script, Good Actors.",7,23 September 2004,"The Notebook was a movie made great by the actors on screen. The storyline is amazingly predictable and most of the lines are cheesy. The special effects, are not so great either. However, I would recommend that anyone and everyone should see this movie for one reason: Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams together on screen. I have never in my life seen two people who had as much chemistry between them as this. What they posses together blew me away and made me glad that I paid to see this movie. The two connected extremely well and made me believe their love and why they would go through such a tragedy for it. On the negative side, Nicholas Sparks is not my favorite author, I did not enjoy ""A Walk to Remember"" for two reasons, Mandy Moore, and the predictable plot line which always appears in Nicholas Spark's novels. But, thankfully, I was able to overlook such blunders and see the core of the movie, Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams",The Notebook

I saw Rachel McAdams in 'Mean Girls.' ANd it was Such a change for her. Shes a very beautiful girl, and they made her up, so well, with the time change difference. ANd Ryan Gosling, he did an excellent job! I don't know who would have done their parts any better than they did. The scenes were so, beautiful, and loving.

Fantastically, utterly believably acted - I got completely drawn into the film, identifying with the characters; artistically filmed with the most beautiful scenes adding to the aesthetic enjoyment, underpinned with beautiful music. Finally a film that captures the reality and transforming power of love beyond the boundaries of youth and of life as we know it. A wonderful counterweight to the usual messages conveyed to us - even daring to mention the word ""God"" at one central scene contrasting science with love (with God).

Direction is good and the movie is meant for those who are in love and feel the essence of it flowing through their nerves. Start is kinda slow , in fact movie is li'l slow but performance of every being was at par.Its heartwarming ... adorable ... and masterpieceLove works in miracles every day such as weakening the strong, and stretching the weak; making fools of the wise, and wise men of fools; favoring the passions, destroying reason, and in a word, turning everything Topsy-turvy.Story is soul of the movie ...

This romantic tale of two lovers split by their differences is not like any other love story. The story feels as if you are reading Allie and Noah's personal diaries, it is so intensely detailed but yet always keeps you questioning. It is not one of those stories where you can predict what may happen in the end. You are constantly questioning what is going to happen, at some points you are almost upset with what happens where you almost believe that is Allies final choice. The movie really draws in its audience, from beginning to end you just can't stop watching.

I went to see it one more time with my mom who also cried through the entire thing. I can't wait until it comes out so that I can buy this movie! If you haven't seen it yet don't hesitate it is such a wonderful love story. It makes me think of my grandma and how her love life was when she was young.

This is a love story to last all time and is something most women dream of finding. To love and be loved like Noah and Allie is something to be enchanted by. This movie sweeps you off your feet, breaks your heart and leaves you expecting more out of life and love.

942,dibbee-1,One of the most romantic movies ever made,10,22 October 2004,I adored The Notebook. The two leads had the most amazing chemistry and were completely believable and realistic for the whole movie. The love James Garner(Noah) showed for his beloved Ali was breathtaking. The scenery was very beautiful especially the scenes with the birds on the lake. This movie was nothing but class from start to finish. I believe it showed how two people (complete strangers) can become one and that there are definitely soulmates in this life. Ryan Gosling was outstanding as the young Noah with his piercing eyes and sensitive nature. Rachel McAdams was a breath of fresh air as Ali and connected physically and spiritually to her costar Ryan. I have also read the book and highly recommend it as well.,The Notebook

Having had high expectations and being a fan of McAdams, I was initially fearing the worst when the film opened and everything seemed quite disjointed. The plot pacing seemed erratic and nursing home set up seemed quite clichéd. It was only after half an hour though that i suddenly was completely sucked in to the film and forgot all about my initial thoughts.The performances from both leads were so experienced and believable that you can really see them having very bright futures. The plot was quick and involving even if the movie was ridden with clichés. But at the end of the day, it was a story within a story and what is more clichéd than the trials of love.I found that the flashbacks were more engrossing than the present day scenes but both sets of actors really made this film for me.Its a film definitely not for cynics but anyone who is a romantic at heart will love this film for what it set out to be.",The Notebook

As it came nearer I found out who was in the film and so with the words from the novel in my head and as I watched this became real for me. James Garner has one of the best narratives that you ever want to hear. I felt I was the recipient of this telling and got involved in it. What was it about teen love? To win the heart of another? Get them together is what and who cares? Even with all of the films now and what you expect is happening in them, this is one that will get to your heart. The different backgrounds, the not so approval from the parents, what do we do kind of thing? And so these young lovers part and have to move on to live their lives. The war is going on and all and then Noah goes to make something of himself. Allie finds out he has restored a plantation and she goes out of curiosity to see him and finds that she still loves him. But she is engaged to be married and he has been dating a young widow. But things have way of working out and due to misunderstanding and parental protection of not getting some letters to her, she has to choose over two men. The present day meshes nicely from the flashbacks and you think that the older Allie isn't remembering her past, but she does and then she realizes the man reading to her is her husband Noah. She is pleased to discover he went with her wishes of reading to her in her state of dementia and for a few minutes she is normal again. But with her illness she is scared and gets panic attacks and doesn't know the man. He is broken up and suffers a mild stroke and is gone for a while, but she looks for the man who befriended her. She is asleep and he comes to her room and tells her he loves her. She remembers him and they are together against the rules but what is love? To have this love forever... and Noah cherishes the times she knows him in the place they are and he isn't leaving her. The promise was to read to her to have her remember. It's sweet and the actors make you feel you know the characters.. it's mushy and it's teary and it's straight forward and it's wonderfully written and directed.",The Notebook

The trailer I watched represented the film a little bit like an old love story, which it also is, but it is more than that. I expected a better end, but this is also OK, it shows that nothing has a totally perfect end. «The notebook» is a drama-romance-story. It's a dramatic love story. The message is that love can last forever, no matter what you're going through. In the film, a passionate young man, Noah falls in love with Allie, a young woman in summer, at a carnival. They come together and are totally in love with each other. During the summer, they spend a great time together and experience a lot. Allie's family, who is wealthy doesn't want her to go out with Noah, because his family is poor. After the painful breakup, Allie leaves and goes at a university in New York. After the death of Noah's father, Noah, desolated, has a plan, to build the house that he promised Allie. During that time, Allie works as a nurse in a hospital and falls in love with a wealthy handsome guy. When they are engaged, she sees a report in the newspaper of Noah with the wonderful new house. Because of that, Allie goes to Noah and they talk together about everything. Then Allie has to decide, Noah or her engaged guy. It's very difficult for her because she loves both of them.The main characters are Noah and Allie. Noah (Ryan Gosling) is a poor young man, who lives with his father in a nice little house. He works in a wood factory. He's adventurous and totally in love with Allie. Allie (Rachel McAdams) is a rich lovely young woman, who lives in a big house for summer. She's beautiful and interesting. I find, they are both really good actors. All the actors in the film grew absolutely in their characters. This film is represented in a straightforward manner. It has a few very powerful scenes, for example the scene, where Allie and Noah are in the boat with all the swans, it has a magical effect and then a little later in the rain, they fell in love again, from which the cover is made. The scenes are all very special and make you feel being in another world. The film «The notebook» is one of my favorite films. I really enjoyed it. I don't like very love story, but this movie is a special love story. This film is one of the most beautiful and romantic films I have ever seen. It is pretty sentimental and romantic. I was impressed by the main actors, they act really well. I already watched the movie ten times and could watch it ten more times. It just has a powerful effect on me; it brings me in another world for two hours. In my eyes, every scene is good, just the last scene is a little bit sad, but that's like it is. The scene in the boat is my favorite, with all the swans, after seeing each other for a long time, Allie and Noah fall in love again. It is a powerful and beautiful scene. One of the first scenes, where Noah jumps on the big wheel at the carnival to ask Allie out on a date, is also one of my favorite scenes. These scenes are special and have some unexpected lovely effects. I would recommend this exciting film to everybody, especially to girls and woman who like exciting beautiful love stories, because the movie is an adventurous romantic story. This movie is beautiful and popular. You should go and see it; it's a film, which should be seen. This movie isn't really comparable, it's unique. It's one of the best films ever. So, go and see it!",The Notebook
949,Kimberly89,This was one EXCELLENT love story!,9,14 February 2005,"I gave the NoteBook a 9 out of 10 because this was one GREAT MOVIE! At first, it kinda dragged on, but then picked up quite well. The first time I saw this film I bawled my eyes out!!!!!!! Everyone should take the time to sit down and watch this, trust me, it is worth your time! The cast in this movie was perfect for the film. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams have great on screen chemistry and they were excellent together. Please, for the sake of movies, take the time to sit down and watch this one!!!!!! Nicholas Sparks, the author of The NoteBook, is a great writer! He also wrote the tearjerker A Walk To Remember.

The casting is better than I ever could have imagined as well as the chemistry and it is such a simple and yet brilliant storyline. I literally saw this movie 3 nights in a row and then two more times about a week later. It deserves all the fame it can get! I just started reading the book and I am really enjoying it. It reminds me so much of the movie and I am so excited to buy it on DVD. I encourage anyone who hasn't seen this movie to see it because believe me, it never gets old. This to me is the perfect example of a 10 star rating. It's got EVERYTHING! The most romantic and intriguing film created!",The Notebook

953,jhedgecock,A Comment on THE NOTEBOOK,10,7 November 2006,"Allie Hamilton (played by Rachel McAdams) is the daughter of a wealthy, southern USA family. The time is 1946 and Allie's parents have moral and social codes common to that era in North Carolina. The parents and Allie are visiting their summer home on the coast for the summer. Allie is seventeen when the story opens. She meets Noah Calhoun (played by Ryan Gosling) a local young man, about the same age, of many good qualities. They date each other throughout the summer and fall madly in love. Allie's parents are alarmed by the young lovers relationship because Noah's family is poor and he has no likely prospects for improving his condition in the future. At summer's end Allie's parents force her to return to their regular home therefore separating the young lovers. Allie and Ryan are kept apart by the scheming of Allie's mother. They now begin separate lives; however, they meet again in seven years. Allie is engaged to be married to a prosperous southerner and Ryan, still unmarried because of his love for Allie, has improved his fortunes somewhat after numerous adventures. The resolution of their love for each other is always in question until the end of the movie. Parallel to the story of the young Allie and Noah is the story of the aged Allie and Noah. The young and the aged scenes interlaced throughout. It is now 1994 and they are elderly. Their human condition finally reveals what happened to their lives and reveals the resolution of their ""summer romance."" This movie is beautifully done via the wonderful book by Nicholas Sparks, the movie script by Jeremy Leven, the wonderful cinematography, and the super direction of Nick Cassavetes not to mention the great location for the movie. The acting by Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling is of ""Oscar"" quality. In this writer's opinion Rachel and Ryan are the hottest young actors in Hollywood. Rachel is absolutely one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen on the screen.",The Notebook
954,grubber33,Gorgeous and beautiful are words that come to mind.,10,26 July 2005,"This movie absolutely steals my heart and just makes me break down in tears every time I watch it. It's such a beautiful story and, although seemingly tragic, the ending just puts the biggest smile on your face.I could find no weaknesses in acting or cinematography and the setting was absolutely perfect. My only issue with this movie is James Garner and Gena Rowlands look nothing like Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. Other than that it is probably my favourite movie to date.I can't help but feel refreshed in a world of cold when I watch this heart-warming movie.Absolute 10/10",The Notebook
955,gvrw1813,Great Love Story,9,14 February 2005,"I must say that this film really moved me like no love story ever did. Perhaps it's because there's so much to identify with. I'm male and no youngster and something true rang when I watched this film. Maybe it's because I am older and have experienced so much of it. The relationship between the older Noah and Allie really ices it. Rachel McAdams' portrayal of the young Allie got to me like she was my own sweetheart. Her youthful exuberance is absolutely captivating! I hope that many young men and women get to see ""The Notebook"". It could really do a lot to help sensitize a generation that might not so likely to indulge in ""old fashioned"" feelings;or to display them.",The Notebook
956,CrnaVata,The mother of all the clichés,1,10 May 2013,"Why this movie is rated so high is beyond me. Don't get me wrong: I'm a girl, love Ryan Gosling and was pretty much excited about watching the movie. Unfortunately, when this torture finally finished after two long and excruciating hours, I just couldn't help to think that this must've been the corniest piece of trash in the history of movie making. The lead actors in my opinion had zero chemistry, and Ryan Gosling really disappointed me as Noah. The diversity of facial expressions was basically nonexistent and the acting was bad. And what's up with the character of Noah? Was he supposed to act and sound like a psycho? Cause if he was, they did a hell of a job. Rachel McAdams was really pretty, and that's basically it. And the ending... Oh, the ending! It was so lame and unrealistic it made me gag. What's heartbreaking and sad about it is a mystery to me. I don't know, maybe I just can't see the grandness of The Notebook, but I certainly don't wish to come across it again.",The Notebook

Each and every character was so well developed in the movie, that you couldn't help but be drawn into the story. The ""realism"" of the relationship made you love it even more. I would recommend this movie to man and woman alike. This is not a chick flick...it is good for all... trust me! I hope they make a follow up movie on the THE WEDDING, the sequel to the THE NOTEBOOK...also incredibly written with much depth and love put into each character. So real to life...Nicholas Sparks is the best!!! On opening night they handed out Kleenex on this one!! Good call, 'cause the big tough guys sittin' behind me were even crying!!

Yes true love does exist for some, yet we strive all our lives to reach it, and these two found it. It is a movie where all ages can relate to. The young audience has dreams of obtaining this kind of relationship. The older audiences have this kind of relationship.The cast's performance was spectacular. These roles that the actors play are so believable and they are someone you can relate to. They capture the moments and bring it directly to you, they challenge your feelings and outlook on life with every scene. They have the ability to tug on your heart strings, make you think about relationships, and get insight into the loving relationships that we have,but take for granted everyday. The movie gives you the insight necessary to pull this one off. The whole movie is filled with passion, love, understanding, compassion and hardships that pay off. The determination of the actors are president throughout the movie. The overall movie rating is a MUST SEE, you will not be disappointed.",The Notebook

Everyone should see this film because is simply outrageous, fascinating. Beside the story of the film, i think that both Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling were a excellent choice to this movie; Rachel McAdams is simply FANTASTIC; her role in this film is magnificent!!!!It's a beautiful drama/love story that shows what is the truly significant of the word ""LOVE"".It's because all of this that i've fall in love by this film and that i decide to vote 10 without the necessity of thinking twice.Sorry about any mistake that you may find. Congratulations for this superb film.",The Notebook
960,lucykirwin,Wonderful old-fashioned love story,10,30 December 2004,"Having heard very little about this film, I ended up seeing it purely by accident, and was very glad that I did.As 2004 draws to a close, I can say without doubt that it was the best film I have seen all year, if not ever.Although it has been criticised for being unrealistic and clichéd, I don't find these accusations particularly helpful. It is true that it follows a fairly traditional and predictable romantic plot-line, but I think this is part of its charm. As you might expect from an adaptation of a novel, it's the story that carries the film, rather than special effects or comedy.The actors were well-cast, and I liked the fact that the young stars (Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams) were relatively little known, compared to other, big-name actors - it made the story more accessible somehow. Balanced by the excellent Hollywood stalwart James Garner's scenes with Gena Rowlands, the overall effect is highly watchable and convincing.The romantic drama of 'The Notebook' also makes a refreshing change to the stream of distinctly average ""rom-coms"" that have hit our screens in recent years. It manages to hold a poignancy and emotional impact where the run-of-the-mill money-spinners fail. Although films like 'Love Actually' have poignant scenes, they are but moments amongst the general light-weight schmaltz. It takes a lot for a film to move me to tears, but this one managed it.It might not be a masterpiece in the eyes of a serious critic, but in terms of being able to tell a poignant, old-fashioned love story in a no-frills, beautifully shot film, this one wins for me every time.",The Notebook
961,Peach53551,Phenomenal,10,11 February 2005,"I cant really put into words what I think of this movie.. honestly. It is so fantastic. I get goose bumps watching some parts and just cry. I can watch this movie 3 times a day, easily. Okay, so maybe that is a sickness, but how can you not adore it? The love and passion that Noah and Allie have for each other is so exciting. I think every girl just dreams of that kind of love some day. Not to mention that Ryan Gosling is gorgeous. And Rachel McAdams is so adorable in this movie, she is so full of life. you just wish they were together in real life. I would love to grow up in the South during the 1940s. Life was so simple back then. Our generation sucks. So much technology and everyone is so worried about their appearance and money status. Life was so simple for them in this movie. They were completely in love, and thats all they needed. The Notebook is the best portrayal of a love story, it really doesn't get any better than that!",The Notebook
962,Krselby,Amazing,10,26 January 2007,"Amazing, I cry every time! It shows that real love is really out there! Even when I gave up hope of losing my love. This movie showed me that there is someone out there for me. Noah and Allie have amazing Chemistary. I love this movie. I watched it 4 times in 2 days. If you plan on watching it make sure you have a box of tissues, a blanket, and someone to snuggle up with. If you've never seen this movie than i suggest you watch this. No you need to watch this. I even own the book now. The book is twice as impactive as the movie. Read the book then watch the movie or vice versa. Whatever you like but I guarantee you will think about love in a different way. Watch it by yourself, with you friends or with you lovers",The Notebook

I never knew that a movie would make me cry as much as the Notebook has. Ryan Gosling (Noah) was gorgeous and an amazing actor. I can't put it into anymore words how wonderful the movie has been. If you read the book The Notebook, and thought that the book was excellent, then you should see the movie, because you won't be sorry. I can continue to say how much I loved the movie, but it won't stand up to how excellent it is. The Notebook is such a heartfelt movie, and the chemistry Ryan and Rachel have on camera as Noah and Allie makes the movie work.

Once was with my boyfriend, and of course, he didn't want to see it because it seemed like a ""Chick Flick"". ... He LOVED it! Now he can't wait to buy the DVD so we can watch it at home. It reminds me SO much of us, and maybe that's one of the reasons I love it so much. But besides that, it is a WONDERFUL love story. Perfect for couples of all ages. I'm sure older couples will especially love it. (When you watch it, you'll understand why.) 5 out of 5; 10 out of 10. Pick a range and this movie is at the top of it. I'd recommend it for anybody and everybody!",The Notebook

It makes you really think of the future and what may happen to you or your spouse in the end. The disease she gets is a awful disease. I have dealt with this and it is not fun. I would not wish this on my worst enemy. I saw it 2 times in the theater. Once with my husband and then with my daughter. I don't remember seeing a dry eye in the theater when we left. The movie comes out on DVD on Feb 8th (hehehe right in time for Valentines Day) This would be a great V-Day gift. Your sure to get some love if you watch this movie with your spouse.

If your looking for something that will keep you entertained and as said above with meaning. This is the movie to watch! It has heart, drama, and all other things! This is yes a chick flick, but it is a good movie to sit and watch with your significant other. This is good that this movie follows the pattern of intro, body, and conclusion. It is not real jumpy, but extremely entertaining. This movie shows a lot of what this society is missing today. Passion, commitment, and a devotion of what love really is. It is set back in the older years, but it really shows the difference of what life was like then compared to now. I think people show really watch this and hopefully it will have some kind of impact on the choices people make.",The Notebook

Great acting and a story well thought !! Rachel McAdams was phenomenal! I recently saw ""Mean Girls"" also with Rachel where she played a real bitch and now something completely the opposite. What a super actress !! Another compliment for the surroundings, clothes and off course her first love Ryan Gosling. I saw him a year or so ago in a movies called ""United States of Leland"" which was also an impressive movie, but not as good as this one. It is a shame that this movie doesn't got the attention it deserves. Many, many other movies like ""The Aviator"" are highly overrated and can not stay in the shadow of this diamond!!

All the way to the very ending.Trust me, I've given my best to guess what will happen, but I couldn't figure it out :DStrongly recommended!",The Notebook

Personally I think the film is played by good actors, and the film has a very interesting turning point. The end is brilliant and makes the tears of your eyes come through. This is a film to be recommended for couples, and it also makes you think that you should really take care of those you love. The film does also give us a good example of how difficult life could sometimes - making right decisions - doing what you self want to - not letting your parents take all the control. You should not miss this film. The point was also very easy to understand.. Brilliant film",The Notebook

I am really glad I did though, because I thought it was great. The story was really creative and I have never seen anything quite like it before. Both Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams did a great job in portraying their characters. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good love story or anyone who just plain likes movies. This is now my new favorite movie. I am just really upset that it still isn't out on DVD. I saw it in the theater back in July of 2004. I have been waiting ever since then, for it to come out on DVD so that I could buy it.",The Notebook
972,MsCub4ever,An important scene was deleted,10,20 February 2005,"I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS CONSIDERED A SPOILER. I watched the deleted scenes when I bought the DVD and I believe the scene where Allie is giving Noah her handwritten notebook, explaining he should read this to her in a few years and she'll come back to him, should be added to the actual movie. It's just a key piece of information that really ties everything together. There are other deleted scenes too but I think some of them were probably deleted to keep the rating from shooting up to an R-rating. This was such a good movie. I saw it twice at the theater and have watched it three more times since I bought the DVD. Oh how I wish I could have been like Rachel and made the right decision.",The Notebook

But it was fantastic.The comments we heard as we left were all very positive. I have recommended this movie to all of my friends and I have definitely recommended Nicholas Sparks books to them too.

974,Grlyq12,This is the number 1 movie of 2004,10,27 January 2005,"I was in love with the Notebook when I read it by Nicholas Sparks. Normally, I wouldn't go to see a movie that was first a book, only because the books are always so much better, but I fell in love with the trailer for the Notebook the moment I saw it. The song Tonight and The Rest My Life by Nina Gordon amplified the love scene that is shown in the trailer, after I saw that I couldn't wait to see the movie. The First time I went to see the movie I saw it with my parents, my 24 year old sister, her 24 year old fiancée, and my best friend who's 18 like me; and by the end of the movie we were all crying. That covers a couple of different age groups, and both sexes. The second time I went to see it in the theater was with my boyfriend, who's 18 and he also loved it even though he thought he would hate it completely. When the movie was over we were both crying (well he was tearing up even though he wouldn't admit it) and he couldn't stop telling me how much he loved me. Now, I've covered 3 different age ranges, 2 sexes, and 2 races. The third and final time i went to see it in the theater was with my other 2 friends, who were also my age and also loved it. Every time I saw it I loved it. I cried and laughed all three times I saw it. After I saw it the third time, I decided that I would have to wait until it came out on DVD to see again, because i couldn't spend the rest of my summer in the dark theater, even though i would've if i could.. but no matter how much my boyfriend, friends, and families loved the movie they wouldn't allow me to see it again and again. So i ended seeing it 3 times in the theater and now i have to wait one more week for it to come out on DVD and I am fiending for it.",The Notebook
975,rosshannahr,The Notebook is a romantic story about a young couple told by an elderly man in a nursing home. Twists and turns along the way make it a fantastic movie.,9,24 September 2013,"The Notebook is compelling movie about an older man named Duke (James Garner) who reads the life story of a young couple to a patient who has Alzheimer's disease (Gena Rowlands). The movie is based on the whimsical tale by Nicholas Sparks that reached number one best seller. In film version, The Notebook is still worth the hype. It takes a classic love story and fills the in the lines with a little added spice. Making a series of events in the young couple's life a little more dramatic or humorous, the director (Nick Cassavetes) takes a simple novel and transforms it into a motion picture that will not be forgotten. What truly makes the movie a memorable experience is the terrific, developed plot that is enhanced by the extremely talented and animated actors, and the convincing nature of the film. The picture goes in and out from the perspective of Duke and the charming elderly patient to the story of Allie and Noah. While focusing on the nursing home, Garner really shows his talent, taking an upbeat and dedicated role. He shows his versatility as he goes from a fun loving man who narrates to a man sobbing, pouring out heartfelt emotion. On the other half of the movie, the story of Allie Nelson (Rachel McAdams) and Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) follows the romantic journey of this young couple. The chemistry between these two actors brings the movie up to a new caliber. Through various stages in their relationship the audience experiences the emotional connection of the two. Even in a simple scene where the Allie and Noah just lie in the middle of the road together, McAdams and Gosling show the humor, romance, and differences in their relationship. The quote that sums up the scene is Allie asking Noah a question, ""What happens if a car comes?"" and Noah responds with the humorous answer, ""We die."" McAdams and Gosling put on such a fantastic show that the viewer cannot help but feel as if he or she were right there with them in the road as well as with the rest of the film.The authentic feeling is carried out by the impressive scenery and brilliant camera-work. Director and cinematographer (Robert Fraisse) create an atmosphere that welcomes movie goers to be a part of Allie and Noah's life. Their talent is clearly shown in the lake scene where trees and swans surround the couple to bring a sense of peace and calm- a much needed with the growing tension from the two being apart for so long. Zooming in, switching between the characters at just the right moments to create an intimate feeling, the audience is drawn in at this critical moment in the lovers' lives. The tale of Allie and Noah is not constant romance however, which is part of why it is such a good movie. Yes, there are plenty of moments that hit the heartstrings of women and men all over, but there are also rich dynamics to the film. The two struggle with staying together with various outside influences trying to tear them apart, and some do! Just as a crucial decision Allie is about to make, the director switches the focus back onto Duke and the elderly patient to reveal of twist in the story, keeping the movie intriguing and fresh. The Notebook is a phenomenal movie that makes the audience laugh, cry, and wish they had something like the complex and beautiful relationship of Allie and Noah.",The Notebook

It's one of those feel good take your breath away with tears movies, well if you're a girl. and it's one that most guys that I know actually have liked. It's a must see! The costumes are unbelievable and the acting is great. Joan Allen plays an excellent character. Make sure to be comfortable because you won't want to get up! The filming is awesome, the sets are awesome, it makes you feel like you really are in the 1940's. Definitely one to buy in my opinion.

As predictable as the plot may appear, this is one of the greatest love stories ever told on the silver screen; it will melt the hardest of hearts. Don't bring a hankie, bring a towel. The screenplay as well as the adaptation portrayed by the actors was superb. This was not a movie on my RADAR at all; my wife selected it because she previously planned to read the book. What a wonderful surprise. I've never formalized my opinion of a movie before, but I felt it was my duty this time around to include my comments in hopes it might influence someone else to see this wonderful movie.

It is an amazing story. The movie displays that, but I was disappointed in the ending. On a scale of 1-10 it would be a 10 even though the ending was in-accurate. It is a wonderful love story and it keeps your attention the whole time. I do suggest that you read the book before seeing the movie because the book is 10 times better than the movie.

979,Ginidancer21,Why others should see The Notebook,10,3 February 2005,"People receive different emotions by watching movies. Some make them cry, some make them laugh, and some fill them with suspense. The Notebook is a movie that combines all of these feelings. It is also a movie that grasps your complete attention from beginning to end. I recommend The Notebook to women of any age because it's a love story filled with mixed emotions and because there is never a dull moment.Many emotions arise while watching this movie. In the beginning you laugh at how Noah tries to sway Allie and never gives up until she finally agrees to go out with him. You then smile when you see how deeply they fall in love. You cry when they have to leave each other. You are filled with suspense when Allie meets another man and gets engaged, but you are left with a smile on your face at the end when Noah and Allie finally get back together.The Notebook is also a movie where there is never a dull moment. Their love for each other keeps your attention throughout the movie as well as the suspense of whether or not they will end up together in the end. Noah and Allie have to overcome many obstacles to be together, but their love gets them through each one.In conclusion, any movie that gives you a series of mixed emotions and grasps your attention from beginning to end is a ""must see."" The Notebook is a perfect example of this type of movie. So, for those of you who have not yet seen The Notebook, I highly recommend you do.",The Notebook
980,swati_enrique,Behind every great love is a great story!,9,23 October 2013,"The Notebook is one of my all-time favourite movies. Its a constant, and classic love story that makes you feel as if you are there watching it.. as if you are one of the characters, which makes the impact of the story just that much more real. There really are no words to describe how this movie makes you feel, but one thing is for sure... It will make you feel. After watching it, i've often just.. sat where i am and just thought about it. It's just one of those movies that you will think about 30 years after watching it, and still get that same feeling in your heart.. and you'll know that it touched you in one way or another. If you haven't seen it, you really are missing out... Its a classic!",The Notebook

982,colly_gunn_4,All time favorite movie! It's not cliché!,10,6 February 2005,"The Notebook is a classic! Noah's personality is so realistic and adds great humor to this emotional movie. There's something for everyone, men and women will both enjoy it! It's romantic but still has heartache and you can relate to their problems. You will laugh cry but most of all enjoy it. It also has a beautiful soundtrack, when you listen to it you picture the movie in your mind...James Garner and Ryan Gosling are the ideal men for me and will be for you. The lengths in which they go for love is remarkable! Perfect to watch for Valentine's Day with a loved one. The two loved birds (Rachael Mc Adams and Ryan Gosling) are perfect. They have differences that make them fall in love and become better people. Its not a movie to miss because once you've seen it, it'll stay in your memory forever! My all time favorite, go see it!!",The Notebook
983,cowgirl_3030,absolutely the best love story i've ever seen,10,8 February 2005,"i work in a video store and the anticipation for this film was almost unbearable -- its just so real and fantasy like at the same time, it makes you laugh at the similarities of your own relationship and yet cry at how sad and crushing their story was. It makes your heart leap at moments and then fall the very next -- its just an amazing movie and the powerfulness of it is just incredible....its perfect!!! I absolutely fell in love with the story of Noah and Allie - the ""will they/won't they"" is just so heart wrenching when you understand the obstacles that they had to face in order to be with one another and then the after-math that follows in the midst to their happily ever after love. The powerfulness of the ""notebook"" itself in the story - that someone would document their love in a book -- and the inscription "" read this to me, - and I'll come back to you"" -- gives me chills just thinking about it. The characters couldn't have been chosen better. - You can almost feel Noah's pain as he tries to move on without his love. -",The Notebook
984,maryhelenmac,Excellent,10,9 February 2005,"I cried and cried and cried, etc. For the hopeless romantic. Even though I have never had that experience, it's nice to know some people have, even though these were fictional characters. Love can and should feel that way. Marriage has it's ups and downs, but if there is genuine friendship, passion, and trust, it is the makings of a long lasting relationship as depicted in the movie. I saw this movie with my 3 kids (my son included). All of us got something out of it. My daughters learned that love must be about that, money dwindles down to nothing eventually without love. My son learned tenderness and compassion. This movie struck a cord in my heart of something I long for. Maybe never, but a beautiful feeling at least.",The Notebook

Noah Calhoun is one of my favorite characters. He's a real man to love A woman like that. Allie, who's got everything didn't give a hoot about his background. But her parents and world war 2 separated them . they see each other 7 years later and had a second chance. it was predictable but its not about how they met and fell in love. it's about how love is so deep it can create miracles no matter what.

It shows that true love really does exist. I definitely recommend this to everyone, especially guys! Noah is so cute and adorable to Allie. He is so sweet and it would be a miracle if guys acted like that today. It's a major tearjerker so make sure you have a box of tissues ready next to you. This is the cutest movie I've ever seen and I don't think any movie could be better than this one. It's great for everyone to watch. It's not only for young people, but older people will love it too. It is such an emotional movie. You'll cry every time you watch it. It really does prove that love can create miracles.",The Notebook
988,raouljax,A romantic movie built on sensitivity and class,10,12 February 2005,"If you want to get into a romantic mood, this is definitely the film to watch. In my humble opinion, it's one of the finest movies done in a recent while. I loved the direction, I loved the storyline and the build up of the mystery and its final conclusion.Looking up the credits of the writer, it turns out that Nicholas Sparks also wrote ""A Walk to Remember"" and ""Message in a Bottle."" I cried and was inspired with the former and heard good reviews about the latter. I can't wait to watch that second movie now.Sparks is a romanticist women must love and most men fail to comprehend. He's certainly a sensitive individual who is able to capture concepts in the printed word. He's mastered an art form so lacking in our present crop of Hollywood junk.I cannot reveal more for the sake of those who haven't watched the movie but if you've lost the fire of hopes and dreams, this movie will certainly rekindle that flame.",The Notebook
989,klk82,enchanting and wonderful,10,14 February 2005,"what can i say. i don't think I've fully recovered from this film. it broke my heart. it is beautiful,passionate and very sad. when i said recovered, i meant that I've only just stopped crying. this is the most captivating film you will ever see. the story surrounds two teenagers who fall in love pre-world war two. events break them apart, but fate brings them back together. and the whole story of the two teenagers love is read to a ageing lady by her gentlemen friend. the cast is spectaculer. Ryan gosling plays Noah, and Rachel McAdams plays Allie. (the two teenagers) and they are wonderful. as is the great James garner who reads the story of these two teenagers to his elderly lady friend, played by the wonderful Gena Rowland's. if you like romance at its best, then this is the film for you...but be warned you will need hankies at the ready! wonderful!!!",The Notebook

I am so glad I purchased this movie. I will watch it several times. It is not often when a movie or program has such a strong meaning behind it. This should be considered a family film. Minus the semi nude scenes, this movie should be seen by all ages. A fantastic story line and so true to life. It is a real eye opener. Now I know why my father-in-law insisted on visiting my mother-in-law everyday at the nursing home until the day he died.

994,cherylsman1,My Girlfriend and I loved it,10,13 February 2005,I went to see this movie with my girlfriend after she had told me she read the book. She said she read the book in one sitting so I figured it had to be good. After the first 15 or 20 minutes of the move I was totally involved in the story and I thought that James Garner and Gena Rowlands were outstanding in their roles. I have always liked both of them and have watched Mr. Garner on television since I was young. This was one of the best movies I have ever seen and when the DVD recently came out I went immediately and got my copy and so did my girlfriend. I hope to see more movies like this soon. There are so many negative TV shows and movies nowadays that it was quite refreshing to see one with a positive theme and one that promotes love instead of hate and violence.,The Notebook

OK, OK enough about how it ended up in my DVD player, I reluctantly sat in front of my TV and started getting into the plot and the characters, before I knew it I was fully consumed by the whole story. This is the first love story I have seen (and I have seen many thanks to my wife) that I have recommended to MY friends (yes men), thats how much we enjoyed it.

Noah and Allie are a beautiful couple thank you for giving me hope that maybe one day love will be that great. The perfect actors were chosen and the love came across so genuine and real that I felt with them. Anybody who believes in love should see and/or buy this movie. It is a heartwarming tale , one I wish was more common in real life. Love is no longer as beautiful as this story is. I appreciate the portal to back when love and life was real.",The Notebook
997,DanisDayOff,"You won't just watch this movie, but feel it deeply. It has so much heart.",10,24 September 2006,"I loved The Notebook, because it is one of the very few movies that touches you as deeply as if the story had happened to you. It has so much heart and depth and a funny and realistic portrayal of teenagers in love. The actors are amazing, you can see the genuine love in Ryan Gosling's eyes, and then his dark sadness and emptiness without Ally.It is so sad that life kept pulling them apart, but you can only marvel at the little difference it makes to their love. Believe me, this is not just a boring, romantic love story... it keeps you interested, smiling and also sad the whole time, and you may find yourself stopping the next day and just thinking about them. That's how real the story feels.The start is my favourite part, when they are young and Noah tries to get Ally's attention, and then at the start of their relationship. It's such a happy and cute part that you can relate to, and a lighter part of the movie. I encourage everyone to watch it, and with an open mind.",The Notebook
998,cupcakecherry20,Why I did not like 'The Notebook',1,15 February 2005,"The beginning and middle of this movie was really great and what I was expecting. The ending however was not. I still won't say how it ends but I was in tears for about 30 minutes. I felt stupid crying over a movie but this really got to me. I rented it on Valentines day because I thought it would be a good romance movie to watch, but I was hit with a ton of bricks. For about the last 10 - 15 minutes of the movie it seamed like they were really trying to drag the sadness on and on. I would not recommend this movie to anyone I know.I know that not every movie or love story can end happily ever after, but I feel like they took things too far. They acting was great. You could actually feel the pain the two characters were going through. The whole experience was a little too real for me. Things come out at the end about how the notebook even got wrote, that will break your heart. Seeing the husbands devotion to his wife, and what it is putting him through, seeing his tears, just killed me inside.",The Notebook

They really casted perfect for this movie.Those two made the movie, made it believable. The connection and fire between the two sucks you in and you can't help feeling for this couple. It's a beautiful story that will make you smile and cry at the same time.I definitely needed tissues when i watched this movie. Both times i was a complete mess!

Every other woman that has seen the movie since it came out(as recommended by me) has LOVED it. It is really a very romantic and sweet movie. It is a great classic love story that is neither sad nor happy, but just completely touching. This movie will make almost anyone cry with the feeling and emotion that it contains. Women will probably find it more appealing, however, men can enjoy it just as well (it makes a great date movie or a sweet cuddle-on-the-couch with the hubby). The author of the book should be proud with the way the director brought out the human emotions and told the story so well. It was a very enjoyable movie (just be sure to have some Kleenex near at hand). I have a feeling it will last as one of the great movies because the fundamental human emotions transcend time and speak to everyone from the old to the young, the rich to the poor, the single to the married.",The Notebook
1001,ccastanedo,Too much of a girl film,1,15 February 2005,My girlfriend asked me to watch this film with her and I was pretty disturbed after I watched it. How does a man get that sensitive and womanly? Hollywood staff must be targeting feminine males because this is not what a man should be like unless he is raised without a father. If he is raised solely by some sort of feminine figure then it should probably fine. Show this man a baseball game or something! I've tried to watch the film a few times but with not luck have always decided that this film is not for me. My girlfriend keeps telling me that I should give it it another chance but after 2 times I believe that I've given it enough chances. Maybe in some other lifetime I will let this film in but at this time I think I've made my choice.,The Notebook

The only part that I didn't like that much was that I basically knew that the old man and the old woman were the young couple in the book. But I didn't know she had dementia. Its just a truly great love story. Almost like a Romeo and Juliet story. I was astonished to find out that Rachel McAddams is the girl from Mean Girls. The 14 yr old or however old she was. Now I just wonder if she's actually older than me. But anyways, that movie rocked and now I want to go out and buy it!! Its a must see!

Again, the cast is superb it is a must see. You won't be disappointed. Nothing like this has ever been written. A tale of serendipity, if you will also occurs in this awesome movie.

Ryan Gosler is perfection, he makes you want Noah for yourself. If you've ever had a first love this is the movie you have to see. It's heartbreaking and heartwarming all at the same time.

Lately, it's much of what I think about, and I've been encouraging many of my friends to see it. Those who have watched it, cannot get over it's profound beauty. You do not have to be a love-sick 'teeny-bopper' to enjoy this movie. My boyfriend bought it for me as a Valentine's Day gift, & even he liked it. So- you do not 'have to have a vagina' to like it.

The acting is magnificent in the apparent endearment of the actors to their roles and their place in the story. The locations are magnificent in their pristine and uncluttered and unpolluted place not only as a part of geography but as a part in time.

It was so romantic to see two young teenagers fall in love then reunite after 7 years and then when aged, to see them still very much in love and together even though their were differences. My favorite scene was when Allie came back to Seabrook to see how Noah was doing and then he taking her for a ride out on his boat. It rains and she stops and turns around and ask Noah why he did not write her. His response was, ""I wrote you 365 letters. I wrote you everyday for a year."" Allie-""You wrote me?"" Noah-""YES!

With a box of Kleenex handy I could watch this movie over and over again. It is not a cliché love story which is so refreshing. The twists and turns in each of the character's lives is so realistic - the movie just doesn't stop. The WHOLE movie right up to the end was just magnificent!

I never really thought one way or another about Ryan Gosling until this movie.

At the time me and my boyfriend had only been going out 3 months and we were a summer love that were both planning to go away to college. We both went to college, but stayed together. Saturday, February 26th will be our 9 month anniversary and he just bought me the DVD for Valentines Day. This movie honestly and vividly depicts the best life-long love story that stems from even summer flings. It shows that love is a result of fate. Love is the most wonderful feeling, but can also drive a person crazy when it is taken away. When you respect, honor, and cherish love the way i is supposed to, you will never regret a second you spend with your soul mate. If you haven't seen this movie... you're definitely missing out and should go buy it immediately... not rent it because your going to buy it eventually because its that good and you would waste 4 dollars by renting it first.",The Notebook
1016,ani_haze,The greatest love story... EVER!,10,22 February 2005,"I saw this movie twice in theaters and three more times when it came out, I absolutely love this movie with all my heart! I think it is the greatest love story of all time because it is so human, and so heart-felt. It's one of those deliciously well-written and well-acted movies that make you laugh and cry and think and feel so many emotions all at once. I loved the story-line and the plot, and I think it has to be said that there was not a single ""bad actor"" in this entire movie- my boyfriend agrees and he's very picky about his movies. I laughed when Finn asks, ""Do you two love each other?"" the night they go to the movies and dance in the street, I laughed when elderly Allie comments about how many pills Noah takes, ""How sick are you?"" I loved the down-to-earth fun that young Noah and Allie had, like riding their bikes with friends and swimming in the river. I think it's the kind of romance, even if it is fleeting, that we all want to experience. It made me so mad the way Allie's parents reacted to Noah just because he was from the ""wrong side of the tracks"" (so to speak). I bawled when Finn died, I bawled when they broke up (I wanted to kill both of them for breaking up when it was so obvious that they were in love, but I knew what Noah meant, and what prompted it, when he said that fancy things and nice things weren't in the cards for him, he wanted what was best for her and he didn't think that he was it), I bawled when Noah's father died (He was the jolliest person in the movie, I love Sam Sheperd's character!), I bawled when Allie left Seabrook, I bawled when her mother wouldn't give her the letters, I cried during the entire movie. I laughed at the story of how Noah used to stammer and poetry was the only thing that worked. I also loved how the movie reveals so much about the characters but leaves just enough for you to wonder about, like for example, does Allie's mother really understand her feelings for Noah? does she regret what she did? does she really only want what's best for her daughter or is she trying to prove a nasty point by showing Allie the man she almost ran off with, who's still in Seabrook and still labors for pennies a day? Or how about Martha? Does she understand, does she feel happy for Noah? Is Allie jealous that this is the woman her man has been spending the past seven years with? Sometimes it was just so aggravating, like Allie going back to talk to Lon after the few wonderful days she spent with Noah. But it just added to the story and made it that much more real. I thought for sure that Allie was going to be hit by that truck when she was leaving Noah, and that's why she couldn't remember, and when Allie said that she knew she should be with Lon and it went to the scene of elderly Noah closing the book I was outraged because I thought that Allie stayed with Lon (because in the nursing home they called him Duke. I finally realized that it was for Allie's sake, so she wouldn't get worked up with him being there because she couldn't really remember who he was). I think everyone can relate to this movie, whether it's because they've loved someone so much or lost someone, or for the lucky few who have actually experienced that kind of passion like in the movie. I think the acting really sealed this movie as the best in years (in my opinion), even though we all know it's just a story the way the actors present what their character is feeling is so moving, like the night in the mansion, the look in Allie's eyes as they are undressing in front of one another and the way she says that she's OK after she won't shut up and Noah asks. Her swig of beer after learning that the room they are eating in now is the one they were in seven years ago. All around this movie is great, I love it! I can't think of one bad thing to say about it, and everyone should see it!",The Notebook

Everything about it. Right from the beginning. ""I am a common man, I've lived a common life, there are no monuments in my name and I will soon be forgotten. But I have loved another with all of my heart and soul, and that is enough."" I was in love with this movie from then on. Just the whole story, watching Noah and Allie fall in love. It really captured me. They were both so funny and beautiful. Noah is the perfect guy. I mean, how could you not love that guy!! And Allie is absolutely beautiful, how could you not love her?? I thought the way he fixed the house for her was just too much. How could you not come back to him?? All the money in the world could not buy that kind of love. I honestly saw the movie only recently and really regret missing the impact of it on the big screen. I can't wait to buy the DVD and the book.

Well done!!!!!Hurray one of my most favorite movies of all time, from the opening scenes until the very end...this movie captivates our hearts!!!The actors were well chosen and very believable.

Usually when i watch movies it was entertaining, but this one completely made my heart throb for love like that. How passionate and extremely beautiful there sex was.. Was completely amazing I don't know about any one else but i was COMPLETELY turned on during them. Not so much of because they were * making Love* its just that it was so special and passionate. The care they had for each other in this movie really made it appealing. I can say this was the best movie I have ever scene. To me it sort of reminded me of titanic. The love scene, and the completely opposite back rounds. Although titanic was a completely different movie it was also an awesome movie.

Needless to say, I loved it. I laughed..and I cried..and I cried..and I cried some more..It's a tear-jerker alright! Anyone reading this who is thinking about seeing it, stop thinking and GO get it..and bring some tissues, because you'll most definitely need them. The acting is incredible, not to mention the storyline. The author of The Notebook also wrote A Walk To Remember, and if any of you have seen that, you know how great it was!

1022,jerry-root,The Notebook as a metaphor,9,12 December 2013,"The Notebook a story of Cognoscente Love While on an airplane I saw the The Notebook. When I watch a movie I like to watch passively in order to fully and uncritically enter into the world developed by the film. Rather than thinking critically at first—there will be time for that later—I want to give the story-teller his due, let him do his best artistically in order to create a coherent world that invites me in. After the film I like to revisit the story and ask critical questions about it. I like to ask, was there any point in the film where I felt particularly moved emotionally? If so, what might have been going on in the film to stimulate this. There was such a scene in The Notebook that moved me deeply and brought tears to my eyes.I must put the scene in context. The Notebook begins when an older man—played by James Garner— enters the room of an elderly woman (Gina Rowlands) at a nursing home. She seems confused and a little standoffish. A nurse reassures by saying, ""Its OK, he comes every day to read to you."" In this moment one surmises that this woman has dementia of some sort and this kind man volunteers at the hospital by reading to the patients.The film goes back and forth between this elderly man reading to this elderly woman and flashbacks from the book being read. The story is about a young man (Ryan Gosling) and a young woman (Rachael McAdams) who, against all odds working against them, fall in love. The young woman is from an upper class family; the young man is relatively poor. The woman comes from sophistication and refinement; the man is unrefined but tender hearted. The man has a high school diploma and likes poetry; the woman is educated in the best schools her parents can afford. The woman has a controlling mother and father; the man's mother has died and his father is present but somewhat distant. The young woman lives far away and only comes into proximity with the man when she happens to be summering in the town where he lives. There is so much distance between these two: socially; economically; geographically; educationally; and, to compound matters World War II breaks out and adds another degree of separation as the young man goes off to war and the young woman working as a nurse begins to fall for a patient more of her class and sophistication. With all the odds against them, this man and this woman do fall in love and marry.About two-thirds of the way through the film the viewer puts it together that this is in fact the old couple's story. The man reads to the woman he fell in love with so many years before. Near the end of the film as the day is drawing nigh and the story nearly read, the older man and the older woman are eating a nice dinner by candle light. A single rose in a vase adorns the table and a phonograph is playing the music that has contributed to so many of this couple's memories together. The entire atmosphere is shouting out to the woman trapped in the deep recesses of her dementia. As the story ends, the woman says, ""That is the most beautiful story I have ever heard; and it sounds so very familiar."" In that moment cognition washes across her face and her expression moves from the vacuousness that once characterized it to an expression flush with perception. She looks at her husband and says, ""It's our story isn't it?"" He says, ""Yes."" She asks, ""How much time do we have?"" He answers, ""Last time it was about five minutes."" She asks what any mother would, ""How are the children?"" He says, ""There fine. They were here to see you today."" She asks, ""Tell them I love them,"" and he assures her that he will.Then, as the music is still playing, she says, ""Hold me, can we dance?"" He stands and takes her in his arms and they begin to move slowly to the music. Then just as quickly as cognition came to her so her oblivion returns. She finds her self in the arms of a stranger and screams. The orderlies rush into the room and find it necessary to sedate the old woman in order for her to calm down. James Garner's character is standing, watching it all, biting his knuckle, and weeping. It was that scene that moved me so deeply. In fact it moves me now as I type this. Why? What was it that was so touching about that scene? Of course it has all the sentimentalism of a great love story between a man and woman; magnified by the triumph of their love to reach across the many things that sought to separate them even at the end of their lives. But, as I thought about it I realized there was more to it than that.I believe the story is a kind of metaphor or analogy that explains something of the quality of every human story. For certainly, all of our lives consist in God telling each of us, perpetually, about his love story with us. He tells of His wooing and loving us. He has placed us in an environment that, one way or another, cries out to us His great love for us. Most of our lives we live as with dementia. Then moments occur when cognition of His love occurs and we respond. Then as easily as we fell into cognition, in a moment, we fall out. In Garners' tears and the biting of his knuckles, I think I saw something analogous to the love of God for us. He cannot love us any more than He does. Infinite love has no capacity to increase. The question is will we be cognizant of that love or not?",The Notebook
1023,mdpunkrocker,"great romantic movie, brought tears to my eyes",10,28 February 2005,"OK i was supposed to see this movie with this guy i know. and now i am very happy that i watched it by myself first. It was an amazing movie, but i started to bawl and that is one thing that i really didn't want Jeff to see me doing. So i highly recommend this movie. it is deeply moving and just sensational. The acting is good, the story, while being a little unreal, was really good. i just cant put in to words how wonderful this movie is. For guys who want to do something romantic, watch this movie with your girlfriend on a day when it is very rainy, or the weather isn't suitable to go out in. and cuddle up on the sofa or lay on the floor and watch it. Do it as a surprise for her. Just a suggestion. All i can really say is i hope that i end up as happy as they did in the movie.",The Notebook

I went in not giving the movie a second thought, and walked out wanting to know more about the story.Rachel McAdams gave an outstanding performance on her portrayal as Allie, a more demanding role than her previous roles in 'The Hot Chick' and 'Mean Girls'. Ryan Gosling could probably be the next Tom Cruise. Having mostly built his career on playing dark characters, he pulled off this romantic lead pretty well.The story itself is touching and does tug at your heart strings. I have to give props to Nicholas Sparks the author who wrote the book the movie was based on for writing such a wonderful love story.",The Notebook
1025,peterg-griffin,An ordinary love story,8,10 August 2005,"There are many features about the Notebook that I liked. For instants the director Nick Cassavetes and actors gave their best towards this movie. Even though there is nothing really special about this film, it touched me: the simplicity and the beautiful way it was filmed..The best part of the film where the performances of the different actors making the film therefor quite believable. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams really succeeded in giving a good-to-watch-performance. The old Noah and Allie (Tim Ivey and Gina Rowlands) had an important role and gave a extremely believable and absolutely brilliant performance.Even though I don't think Rachel McAdams (young Allie) was the right actor for her role, I found her to be quite good and believable. Especially when she was acting a teenage girl. Ryan Gosling I a different matter, I think he was just the right choice for his part. He did really well in acting a teenager and the later a more mature man. Brilliant work from both the actor Ryan Gosling (young Noah) and the director Nick Cassavetes.I personally watch tons of movies and I often like them even though many might say I sucks. I don't actually even like love stories that much, but the Notebook brought to my mouth these words; This movie has been done out of love towards movies. My opinion is still quite simple: It's mostly just a good-old, ordinary love story with a nice touch to it.The film succeeded in being the film that it was suppose to be. Well made and worth a watch at least from DVD, TV or cable..",The Notebook

He is not obsessed he just has fallen into a heart warming love tale that captors all. All most ever one that i know has cried there eyes out, in the good parts the sad parts and every where in between. Some cant even take their eyes off the screen.

If some men could only learn not to conform to society and be in touch with their true beings without fear of disapproval, there would be many more potential husbands. Noah, the main actor is indisputably the most convincing actor I have ever seen. He delivers an example that should be followed by other men.

At the beginning of the movie it was a little slow but as you get to the Ferris Wheel part, it gets interesting! The whole plot of the movie is about a guy, Noah, who is trying to remind the love of his life, Allie, how much they meant to each other when they were in their twenties because she lost most of her memory as she grew older. This movie switches back and forth between seeing the old couple and seeing them when they were young. When you get to the middle, you will see Noah and Allie's kids. You will hear them asking if Grandma remembers yet. This part is very important because it shows that not only did it effect the couples relationship but it effects the entire family's relationship.

I work in a hospital and see many elder couples come in and see the love they have for each other even after 50 or more years. I also see when one of the two gets sick and lingers on while the other comes and visits them everyday rain or snow..Much talk about this movie is about the younger actors but the relationship that has lasted ( seen thru the photos in the notebook ) is what really made the movie for me. Even when he was losing the true love of his life he gave up everything else including his house and kids to spend as much time as he could with her! If anyone is reading this stop and think when was the last time you spoke or visited with your mother-father-grandparents etc. Life is short and isn't it what we experience everyday in his or her life what really matters?

The most captivating aspect is the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Rachel Mcadams. I'm not sure if I have ever seen better chemistry between two people.

My wife and I watched it together and it confirmed that we are where we are supposed to be. I truly believe that relationships like the one portrayed in the movie exist today but are not celebrated. We mostly only get to see the negative aspects with being involved in one. Too many times people just settle for something that might be safe or more accepted by others. I think this more often then not leads to regrets. Much like the one that was stated by Ali's mother towards the end of the movie. Total commitment to each other is what it takes to make a close and real relationship work and I think that was shown. Was this a movie that ""moved"" me? Absolutely! Great movie!",The Notebook

Him and Rachel (Allie) should definitely do more movies together you could just feel the chemistry between them!!! Great movie!!

1036,qaz53074,Was This a Made for Lifetime Movie?,4,31 March 2006,"This is a beautifully photographed film, however I don't feel that that's enough to recommend this movie. It feels like a made-for-Lifetime movie, meant only to tug at your heartstrings. The story is thin and predictable (I knew who the older couple were from the first scene). And indeed, the plot is not very unique. (The same thing happened to my mother: she fell in love with -gasp- a Jewish man, was sent off to boarding school, her mother stole the letters from the young man, etc, etc. But she didn't reconnect with the ""love of her life"" until she was sixty years old.) The movie does portray young passion quite well, and with a modicum of humor, but it's not very interesting. Unfortunately, the movie is littered with anachronisms. For a much more interesting story, buy ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" instead.I originally rented this movie because I love Gena Rowlands and, although her performance is stunning, she doesn't have much screen time. The young leads (Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams) are believable, but not stellar. The best scene in the movie is when Allie's mother takes her for a drive and tells her about her first love.BTW, (with apologies to Mr Zigman) some of the score has been stolen. During the scene where Allie discovers the painting supplies, the underscore is playing the theme from the movie ""Making Love""!

It was sad that they both died at the end, but extremely wonderful that they did together. Noah worked hard to get Ali back, he did anything he could to make her remember him, if only for a short while. That is true love, never giving up on the thing you love.

1044,nflszyy,Best movie I have ever seen,10,21 January 2014,"This is definitely the best movie I have ever seen. I totally love Rachel and Ryan, and the sparks between them are so natural so real. It is a great romance story that made me cry and the feeling was everlasting. But there is more I want to say.When Allie has to make the choice between Lon and Noah, she tells Lon that she loves him but she feels like an entirely different person with Noah. (Here I should say I don't doubt her feelings for Lon. Actually I think Lon is a great guy and Allie truly loves him.) The point is clear. With Noah, she paints all the time, she lives in a dream house, and she does things she truly wants. Allie finds her true self only when she is with Noah. There is this scene with Allie saying ""I don't paint any more"" ""I used to paint all the time"" and Lon responding by ""So paint"" in a tone that clearly shows he doesn't care much. But when she comes back to Noah, the surprise for her is her own room and a beautiful balcony for her to paint. That is the difference between Noah and Lon. Noah represents a life that Allie has always truly wanted. Lon represents a life that is secured but clearly lack of some key elements. She ended up choosing Noah not only because she loves Noah more, but also because she loves herself more when she is with him.I learned very important lessons from this movie. Every time when you are making a difficult choice, just ask yourself, what do I want? What do I really want? Don't care about what others think, just ask your heart. The choice is never easy, but your have to give it a try, and you have to overcome all the difficulties with a brave heart. And try to picture yourself in 20, 30 years to see if it is the life you want.If any of you happen to understand Chinese I have a great review on The Notebook to recommend.http://movie.douban.com/review/1549231/",The Notebook
1045,ekbene,I love this movie so much!,10,21 March 2005,"This movie was so wonderful in every way! It's hard to put into words just how much I loved it. The actors were amazing (not to mention easy on the eyes!), the story was amazing, the scenery was amazing! I totally escaped into this movie, to the point that I felt what they might be feeling...butterflies in my tummy and all! I have never seen Ryan Gosling or Rachel McAdams, and I was blown away by their performances. What perfect casting! James Garner and Gena Rowlans were wonderful, too. But it was Ryan and Rachel and their incredible chemistry that really stands out in my mind. I think a lot of guys might pass on seeing this movie, considering it to be a ""chick-flick"". I think they would be missing out. This is a beautiful love story for both men and women. I recommend it to everyone who has ever been in love! Or dreams of falling in love...The only thing is, this movie may change your standards! This movie is a definite must see!",The Notebook

Even you men can enjoy this movie too. If you've ever been in love you will automatically love this movie, because it is the most beautiful love story. To see two characters care so much about each other is just beautiful. It's definitely a tear jerker...and a great great great movie. Definitely in the top ten movies on my list! It is passionate, comical at times, and sad... It is a movie that i think everyone needs to see..and also that everyone can relate to.

You really feel that their characters are real. I cried when I saw the movie at the theater, cried when I read the book..and every time I watch the DVD i cry! The story is so heart-felt and real. The Notebook touched my heart and soul on a very personal level. It is about following your heart and making yourself happy. Because ultimately you have to live with your decisions. Everyone should see this movie! Everyone deserves to have a love story like this of their own. Or at least a dream of a love this strong in your heart. If you can learn anything from this movie it should be this, the only things in life you come to regret are the risks you didn't take....",The Notebook

But of course who could forget Gena Rowlands and James Garner who were so great and very touching in there portrays of the older Ally and Noah so heartbreaking!I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody who believes in love at first sight,soulmates,everlasting love.Thank you Nicholas Sparks and Nick Cassavetes for writing and directing such a beautiful love story!!!!",The Notebook
1049,latondre1,Corny!,6,27 March 2005,"This movie is extremely corny. If scenes like the son on the porch reading poetry to his father as his new girlfriend walks up, sound appealing to you, then you will like this movie. There really isn't anything fresh in this story. The two main actors are rather mediocre. The mediocre acting makes it more difficult to immerse yourself in the story. The main male actor has modern looking longer hair during scenes from the 1930's and 1940's, even while serving in the military. These things can be minor compared to the flaws in logic in the storyline. I found the movie to be more of a comedy due to the corniness and weak plot.",The Notebook

1052,thefobster,Surprising...,8,30 March 2005,"I was a bit skeptical of this movie. Firstly; I'm not a huge fan of ""chick-flicks"" and secondly I had read a few critic's reviews and none of them seemed to indicate anything out of the ordinary love story. However, my wife said that we needed to watch it so I rented it and from the moment the movie started until the very end I was captivated by it. The acting chemistry between McAdams and Gosling is pure magic. They are so believable that they make the viewer feel as if they aren't watching a movie, but watching a documentary.I won't say anything about the plot as I wouldn't want to ruin anything for anybody, but it's a marvelous story and not one that's easily forgotten. I highly encourage everyone to watch this film. You won't be disappointed.",The Notebook

I knew in my area that it didn't last long at the regular theaters and ended up at the 'Cheap Seats' movie theater and was gone before I knew it. So, having said that, I wasn't expecting much when I rented this movie. OH, HOW WRONG I WAS! I rank this movie up there with Forrest Gump, Fried Green Tomatoes, Green Mile, etc...I think you get the picture. Having dealt with similar issues in my family as the older Noah and Allie did, it really hit home. It is beautiful, both in story and in scenery, from beginning to end. Keep plenty of tissues handy! This is a movie worth having in your collection (I most CERTAINLY added it to mine!). The actors were all great, the story line was very believable, easy to follow. I hear that there may be a Notebook 2?? If so, seeing The Notebook, makes me want more of this story. Simply Beautiful!",The Notebook
1054,Vulcangw,It will touch you.,10,3 April 2005,"Love stories are often about the excitement and romance of falling in love, something most of us have gone through ourselves. But what made this movie so great for me was the devotion and the pain that was born from the love. When my mother died, I (along with my father and other family members) reflected back on her life. Through her final years, our focus had been on the insecurity and moodiness she showed during her illness. But with the mourning in her passing, our focused turned to where it should have been all along - to her whole life and all the good that was born from the love she shared with my father. This movie has caused me to again reflect not only on my mother, but even more so on my father and his loss. The love my parents generated in their youth (according to my father's accounts) was passionate and exciting, but it was the love that grew over the years and matured in the sunset of their lives that was most beautiful and everlasting. This movie, more than anything, drives home the most important aspect of love - the commitment, devotion and sacrifice that can result only after years of growth.",The Notebook
1055,tasnim82009,"The Notebook: Soppy, Cheesy, a bucket full of Cringe and just plain Bad",3,30 December 2014,"CONTAINS SPOILERSAll that can be said is that if you do choose to watch this film and happen to have a weak constitution for slushy mushiness, you are advised to have your sick bags at the ready; or if you're feeling exceptionally sensitive, a box of tissues or maybe 4.The film begins in present day, as an old man calling himself Duke, superbly portrayed by James Garner, reads a tale from his Notebook about two star-crossed lovers from the 1940's: Noah (Ryan Gosling) and Ally (Rachel McAdams). He's a poor labourer with a passion for love and poetry whilst she's a high-flying society girl with rich parents who naturally, don't approve of the love affair; so far so cliché  Even from the onset we can just see what sort of romantic cliché this film will turn out to be. So typical. A story of how love conquers all, how nothing matters but love, love makes everything become hunky dory; how beautiful! Not. 'The Notebook' may have you in tears, but it had me gagging right from the beginning. A summer of love and romance, that's what it was! They were together all summer long and couldn't take their eyes (or hands) off each other. Isn't it weird to be able to do that in public in the 1940s? - especially as they were unmarried, oh and wasn't that random house in the middle of nowhere so very convenient? Regardless, they were completely and utterly madly in love with each other. Aww, isn't that just adorable? Because what do we have if we don't have love? Well, money according to Ally's parents, lots and lots of money. Such typical parents they were, haven't we had enough of parents not approving of the poverty stricken bad guy? Oh parents and their dubious morals eh?Despite the fact they came from completely different backgrounds, they did have a few things in common: They were both crazy, they both did mad things (like lying on a road and waiting for death) and most importantly, they were both CRAZY about each other, ugh someone pass me a sick bucket, please!Obviously, the couple were destined to be apart and eventually when Ally's parents couldn't separate them, war did. Have we not had enough 'war' stories to last us a lifetime? Do we really need anymore? Apparently yes and a terrible one at that. I mean be original, we need something special not a Romeo and Juliet copycat. And this whole concept of war is just horrible because there was so much more pain and suffering to the second world war than it shows in the film. As if every significant thing that happens in this world is just suddenly linked to some sickening love story. But oh, it doesn't end there! They meet once again 7 years later when Noah is advertised in a newspaper and everything comes back to Ally again who starts to feel like that love stricken 17 year old once again! Oh like we didn't see that one coming! What is the need to make things so obvious? But after they meet, do they rekindle their romance straight away and get married, live happily ever ¬¬¬¬¬¬after so very wonderfully? Nope, there's a twist: Ally's engaged to the man of her parents' dreams and apparently, hers too uh ohWhat makes this film all the more boring is how it constantly flashes back and forth from the past to present day. In the present day we find out that the woman 'Duke' has been reading to happens to be Ally (now not so greatly played by Gena Rowlands) with a profound case of dementia (ooh plot twist). However this is not any type of dementia it's such a 'special' case that for about 5 minutes at the end of every day Ally remembers everything! The soppiest part was when her children came to visit and were so VERY disheartened by Ally's ability to remember her own children, therefore attempting convince their father Duke (or should I say the very special Noah) to come and live with them again. Oh what caring children they are! I feel like this twist was also quite an obvious because, why else would it start off with an old man reading a story to an old woman? Obviously, these people mean something no? In my opinion, the whole film is completely predictable so the film really is a pointless mess.What a sentimental fantasy! I mean how on earth would that in any way be logical? Well I guess films are not supposed to be, especially not love films. Nope this one in particular is exceptionally magical because everything (and I really do mean EVERYTHING) seems to work out in their favor, even when Ally essentially no longer has a purpose to her life. Assuming you are not going to watch the film after reading this, let me just ruin it for you completely and tell you that THEY DIE IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS. And that is my friends, how this story ends. I hope, I have not written this for nothing, do not watch this film, or read the book as you may love it and become brainwashed by how ridiculous it is. So, ladies and gentleman, I hope I've finally persuaded you enough that The Notebook really isn't worth your time. There's so much more you could do with those two hours, really there is. I'd rather sit and watch someone laugh hysterically then go through another two hours of my time watching that. But obviously not everything's all that bad, it's just personal opinion.

Better to be safe and mark it so)I loved the scene when Noah took Allie to the old mansion for the first time, and even though they wanted to ""prove their love"", he was still gentleman enough to say that she didn't have to go through with it if she wasn't ready and that he could wait...that's more indicative of true love instead of just some hungry male trying to get in her pants. I loved, loved, loved this movie...but I didn't understand why her mother would keep all those letters. IF she really desperately wanted Noah out of her daughter's life, then why wouldn't she have destroyed them on the spot? And weren't there inconsistencies with hair colors?

The way they look at each other, the way they talk to each other infers something very natural in the whole process. An excellent and brilliantly produced film which transmits a ""feeling"" otherwise missing in most films today. My daughter, who had first read the book, assures me, that the film is really VERY good in comparison! An attribute which one seldom hears! The film created an atmosphere of reality, transferring us back into the 1940's at the beginning, moving us on to the 50's after the war up into the (almost) present day during the narrations of the wonderful James Garner.",The Notebook
1059,lawrencesophie17,a great love story,9,11 April 2005,i think this film sums up what a love story should be like. It contains all the problems that love faces. It will probably make you cry as it is such a lovely story. If you are thinking about buying this movie but are not 100% sure i strongly advise you to get it as it is such a great film and people can enjoy it for years to come. everybody can enjoy it from any age as a lot of people can relate to it. i think that a lot of people will remember their first love and i think that the notebook portrays how people actually feel about their first love very well. i think this film will end up to be a great classic film and everyone will love it just like a lot of the other Nicholas Sparks novels turned films.

Trite, unoriginal, highly improbable, sappy & sentimental and poorly acted (except for Rachel McAdams -she's so purty!-) It's always the same story, boy meets girl, one of them is from the wrong side of the tracks, parents disapprove and will their love survive? Boring. The subplot or whatever with the old man reading to the old woman is interwoven inexpertly and there is very minimal suspense before you figure out who these guys really are. To be fair, some of the scenes are very beautiful, and the rain storm scene was actually really good, but that doesn't make up for the other hour and a half of clichés.

1062,premereuragnetha,the notebook,8,26 March 2014,"Producer: Lynn Harris and Mark Johnson Director: Nick Cassavetes Rating: 8/10 Distributor: New Line Cinema Running time: 123 minutesThe film is based on a book written by Nicolas Sparks. Nick Cassavetes directed the movie. Besides beginning a good director, he is a good actor as well. In the same year, he made this movie, he received a Daytime Emmy Award for a television special ""The incredible Mrs. Ritchie"". Another great and successful movie is ""My sister's keeper"". This movie as well as ""The notebook"" are tearjerkers, but they are not just tearjerkers, they tell a great story too. The movie begins in a nursing home, where a old man called Duke reads a story to a old woman, whose memory is slowly fading. The story is about a country boy, Noah, and a city girl, Allie. They meet at a fair, it was love at first site for Noah. After a special night where Allie also fell in love with him, they were together the whole summer. At the end of the summer Allie's parents took her back home, so she could go to college. At first she wanted to go, however at the end she wanted to stay with Noah. Although Noah wrote a letter every day, Allie never received one. After seven years of heartache Allie met a rich soldier Lon and got engaged. One day, before she got married, Allie saw a picture of Noah in a newspaper. She wants to see him and went back to the village to spend some time with him. Allie didn't want to leave, so she had to choose between the rich Lon and Noah. The part of Noah was played by Ryan Gosling. He started acting when he was 13 years old. He doesn't just act, he writes music and has a band ""Dead Man's Bones"". This year he started to write a script ""How to catch a Monster"". Ryan played the role very well, he's nonchalant way of playing brings the country boy alive. He's co-actress is Rachel McAdams, is playing the role of Allie. Just as Ryan she began acting at the age of 13. In 2004 she played in the movie ""Mean Girls"". For her role in this movie she got the award for ""Breakthrough female performance"". Duke was played by James Garner, a very famous actor. The old woman was played by Gena Rowlands. This movie won 11 prices and was nominated 7 times. One of the prices was for the best kiss. Maybe this was due to the fact that the lead actors had a affaire during the making of the movie. This is a great example of a romantic drama. It is a love story, but with ups and downs. At first she is not very fond of him, he has to persuade her to spend time with him. A good example is the following scene: He climes on the Ferris wheel to ask her on a date. He hangs on a bar and pretends he's gone fall unless she says yes. I found it a very good movie. It is not just a typical romantic movie, the story could also be reality. It is not all fantasy, summer love happens in real life. You are dragged into the story because the persons are very sympathetic. The movie shows us how people can care for each other, like Duke reads to the women every day. So I recommend this movie because it just a simple movie and not a romantic cliché. You don't always need to have special effects, simple can also be good.",The Notebook

I like him enough but I wish I'd gone for that one true love like Allie did.Watch the whole film start to finish. You will be hooked. Allie will capture your heart and Noah is a godsend.

The older leads are also brilliant and very natural. Though the movie rings a bell to Tim Burton's Big Fish, its a tale told well between generations and time line. But what this movie really does, is that it helps realise that falling in love once, can change your life over and over again. it explains that home security and family duties are great factors affecting love as in ""look beyond the bed of roses"".I've rated the movie 8/10 because its a love lesson thats probably too late for some others to learn from but soothing nonetheless, please see it as I'll recommend it to anyone thats loved once.",The Notebook

WE often make fun of mum losing her memory, but now I know how life shattering it will be should it ever eventuate. ALso watching this movie makes you yearn for the feeling we all felt when we first encountered the love partner we are now with. These two people are just so fortunate that they carry this feeling all of their lives. It will now make me try harder with the one true love of my life to try and find that little spark and recreate it into something that I want to carry with me the rest of my life.Thank you Mr Sparks for your beautiful story.regards Julie",The Notebook
1073,adamsblueguitar-1,Am I the only one who thinks 7.8 is underrated?,10,18 May 2005,"This is probably the best chick flick I've ever seen. I see everyone downing the movie on these boards. I believe they need to go back to the star wars and LOTR boards. Don't get me wrong, I'm a SW and LOTR fan myself. :P But this movie was great. I'm a 21 year old guy, and yes, this movie made me tear up big time. I thought the acting was great for how young the stars were, and such a change of roll for Rachel McAdams, coming from Mean Girls. My girlfriend read the book, and she thought the movie did a great job of representing it. Of course it was predictable at times, but you wanted a big surprise? They all turn out to be Jedi maybe? :)",The Notebook
1074,ratneshj5,Summer Romance,9,18 August 2014,"The Notebook (2004) Cast: Gena Rowlands, James Garner, Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, James Marsden Director: Nick CassavetesAn awesome romantic drama is portrayed by Nick Cassavetes. Innocence of summer romance,harshness of society, social difference,hope and everything that is needed to make an awesome heart touching plot is in it. Story begins with old Noah (James Garner) narrating their story to his love, old Allie (Gena Rowlands) suffering from a rare incurable disease because of which she can't remember things. Noah is an adrenaline-filled, innocent boy who works at a wood factory. Allie is a sweet, seventeen year teenager whose life is guided by her rich parents. In summer of 1940's, Noah and Allie first meet, and within few days, they become inseparable. Such type of sweetness of first love is seen on screen after a long time. Great photographic sceneries involving beautiful locations of countryside , calmness of a river and grace of night are mesmerizing. Due to social differences, stubbornness of Allie's parents, tough reality, they got separated . Noah is trying hard to get back to her summer love, but everything he tries is in vain. Finally,they move on. Allie starts enjoying her college life, leaving behind the thoughts of the past. Noah, too joins US army during wartime, but deep within his heart there is still a hope that they will meet one day.By selling his father's house and loan from banks, Noah builds his dream house, which he promises to built during summers of 1940 to Allie. Allie gets engaged with a rich western army Lieutenant, Lon. Though Noah spends some time with Martha, a war widow, his summer love's memories are still not faded. With interesting sequential situation, Allie again finds herself back with Noah in their dream house. She gets in dilemma again whom to choose poor Noah or rich Lon. She finally chooses what is right for her and lived happily thereafter.Every role in the movie is well scripted. James Marsden deserves a mention for managing to pull off a difficult role as the ""rich man"" well. It is a must watch movie for all those who are bored with Sci-Fi movies like ""Terminator"" series and interested in watching a beautifully crafted romantic screen plot.",The Notebook

I'm biased toward no particular type but when given a choice I prefer drama any day. The notebook is 2004's winner in my book for the best dramatic romance. I am so glad my sorority sister brought the movie home and asked me to watch it. She cried and I balled my eyes out. Why someone wrote such a bad briefing on the back of the DVD, I don't know. I would have never watched it had I not been asked and boy am I thankful. May I just say that the scene on the dock (on the DVD cover)without a doubt is the most remarkably heart wrenching part of movie and is incomparable to any other dramatic scene played before. Forget 10. This movie is off the scale.",The Notebook

The Notebook makes you feel like your back in the era, with the clothes, hairstyles, and the props. I love the acting, the scenery, the love story to go with it. Most people can relate to this love story which brings people of all ages to enjoy this movie, even men! I have read the book, and like most people do not like the movies that come from books, but this is an exception. I like the book, but I love the movie. The Notebook was directed and put together wonderfully! Every scene is beautiful, ever actor is amazing, and you feel like the movie takes place in the most beautiful part of the country!

For me this is the perfect love movie. And i recommend this movie to everyone including the people of modern day society who forgot what love is really about. After the movie ended it left me crying, and i'm as much a man as a man can be. This is the first time since i've been a kid i cried cause of a movie. I pictured me and my girlfriend growing old together and this movie reminded me that love is the purpose of life, to love and be loved. If you find this movie boring or just didn't like anything about it, means you clearly are missing something in your life, lets all hope each of us finds true love in their lives.",The Notebook
1078,mel20,Cried my eyes out!!,10,5 June 2005,"This is the best love story ever made. I cried my eyes out throughout the last hour of the film. I was so hooked that I watched all the deleted scenes as well. By the way, the alternate sex scenes they had to edit for the final cut were way better and more intense than the ones you see in the final film. I suggest everyone should buy the DVD so they can see how Noah and Allie REALLY get it on after they reunite! It shows how strong their attraction is for one another rather than only their love. I read the book immediately afterward and for the first time in my left felt the movie was better! It goes into more detail how Noah and Allie met and their initial breakup. I also like the fact that it takes place in the '40s during WWII. The end is better in the movie than the book b/c you know they were even meant to...oh can't go any further! I'd be spoiling the ending! JUST GO WATCH THIS MOVIE! Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams' acting is incredible and sooo believable!",The Notebook
1079,xoSandlot05ox,Sensational movie experience,10,6 June 2005,"The Notebook is an exceptional movie with real emotion. The love connection between Allie and Noah is unreal; they make the movie with their passion for each other. I am a huge fan of this movie and watch it constantly. The passion between Noah and Allie makes your heart melt. Although there are intense parts of the movie, Noah always makes them out to be so sweet and romantic. He cares for Allie so much and you cannot find that kind of love in a man these days. The notebook is like and escape to what women really want in a man. The notebook is hands-down the most excellent love story I have ever seen. I recommend this movie to any woman that is looking for a sensational movie experience, and to any man that would like to see every woman's dream.",The Notebook

That was an understatement! This is not your typical sappy Hollywood romance story. It is an amazing story of what true love, dedication and commitment are all about.My Mom had a stroke in Feb. and my Dad has been amazing through it all. After watching this movie I called him bawling, telling him how much his love and dedication for my Mom touched me, and how he needed to see this movie, to see what the miracle of true love can do. Well, he bought it and we just watched it again tonight, and they both were very teary eyed. My Dad said that it was good but sad- but I reminded him to let it inspire him to see what the power of true love can really do! A Very heartwarming film, that in my opinion, is also a small piece of hope of the power of true love.",The Notebook

The way it is put together is really fantastic! It is a story of a young couple who are torn apart by Allie's parents then again by WWII. 7 years later they find each other and its love again! This story is being told to a women (Allie when she is older and in a Nursing Home) who has forgotten her past but the reader, who is Noah recaptures the magic!

1083,raygell,The Notebook is an excellent movie!,10,29 July 2005,"I really enjoyed the Notebook. It was a tearjerker but I watch it every time I catch it on cable. I love Nicholas Sparks' stories. I hope they make more of his books into movies. I also loved A Walk To Remember. The Notebook makes me cry every time I watch it but I can't help but watch it whenever I can. I love Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams both separately and as an on-screen couple. The movie was very well done. I thought Joan Allen played the snobbish mother to perfection. I like the way Ryan Gosling's character was in contrast to Rachel's character. I love the fact that even though they argued all the time they loved each other unconditionally. I especially like the fact that he never left her side even through her illness. Nobody tells a story like Nicholas Sparks and I hope he keeps writing. I want to see more from Ryan Gosling, he is soooooo SEXY!!! I liked him in Remember the Titans also. He looks especially good with the facial hair. Everyone out there should check out The Notebook if you have the opportunity. Go out and buy the DVD right away.",The Notebook
1084,RobinB-public,I've really tried to enjoy 123 minutes of cliché...,4,8 January 2015,"*Sorry for the bad English. Review contains heavy spoilers!* I watched this movie, because my girlfriend wanted to see it.In the first few minutes I tried hard to enjoy it and find something positive, despite the fact that this kind of movies aren't in my favor, and the movie in general (without a detailed look) isn't that bad, but: Even if I didn't know ""The Notebook"" or a trailer of the movie, it was no real problem to predict the COMPLETE plot of the whole movie. That's because ""The Notebook"" is just a giant cliché. His wife with dementia, even the fact that this woman is his wife (the movie would be way more interesting if this fact wouldn't be so obvious), both are dying at the end, Allie and Noah breaking up because of some obvious (but stupid) things, Allie fell in love with another guy, Allie chooses Noah at the end, Ryan Gosling is topless (a lot)... and so on... Sorry but I have no reason to waste 123 min of my life for a movie, where everything is so damn obvious and the plot has no real surprises for the viewer.I understand that a lot of people like this movie and it's okay, as I already said: In general it's a good movie, but just don't think about the details!",The Notebook

I cried so much that I went to bed with a huge headache, and slept feeling a little sad... Sad to know that life is not like that anymore, that is not so pure, so simple, so beautiful! But, by other side, I felt really happy to see such a wonderful love story being told in a movie in this days. It's a hard thing to see, I guess everyone will agree with me. So, I recommend this movie to all those who are needing to feel alive again, and to those who need to make their hope once more, that one day they will find the love of their lives!",The Notebook

I love the chemistry between Noah and Allie oh my i don't think i have ever cried so much. This movie is excellent and the way they had it like old fashion was awesome. I absolutely love Ryan gosling and Rachael McAdams in this movie. It is a must see movie. The setting of the place and how they made it look so like the old times was great. The story line was incredible it will make everyone believe there is someone out there like Noah. Even though they were two different people that didn't stop them at anything. Ryan and Racheal did an excellent job you would really believe them in this movie.,The Notebook
1087,ivita_dita,Funny and romantic,10,13 June 2005,"This film was amusing to me. It made laugh and cry. Very nice, very profound, and not too explicit (on the sexual content). I was very touched with the plot because it was realistic to me. It's also in a way a little supernatural, because it's based on belief of miracles. I also found it to be a story that some, not most, can relate to when they think of LOVE. It's a nice movie to bring out feelings and memories of young love, which is very rare in this time and age. I also thought it was sad at some moments, but in a positive way. The movie made me think of an older couple that I know that is still in true love. I recommend this to anyone, not children though, because it's still an adult movie (I think).",The Notebook
1088,rhkannapu2,"I didn't just watch the movie, I felt it",10,22 February 2015,"Haven't seen anything of this touching in years. The movie just made my day. In fact, it tells us how eternal love can be between two bodies with the same soul. If you really love someone, let them free like a bird, they would be back for sure if they have loved you too. I thought A Walk to remember was Sparks' best piece, but I was wrong. I believe Sparks gives us more and more surprises. I also sincerely request directors that more of Sparks stories be picked. These days the trend has been so different that we hardly find such movies. I wish good health and happiness for all those who've been part of the movie. Long Live Pure Love.",The Notebook

1090,everybodyz_irish,The Notebook makes me cry every time!,10,4 November 2005,I'm completely in love with the Notebook. It makes me cry every single time I watch it. Nicholas Sparks is an amazing writer and the movies that have come from his novels are pure genius in the chick flick genre. When I've just broken up with someone or I'm just having a really bad day I often find myself curled up with a Nicholas Sparks book. The Notebook represents that true love that every single little girl hopes she will one day find. Most of us aren't that lucky but this story really gives me the hope that true love really is out there. I can't even begin to explain how highly I recommend this movie. It is one of the greatest love stories of all time.,The Notebook

The actors were fantastic.

1092,vandag-1,A Youthful Summer Romance That Does Not Want to End,10,25 November 2006,"A summer romance that lasts forever. Magnificently performed by the entire cast. Separated by war and parents at the end of the summer, the young couple's love does not diminish and eventually they are reunited. The story is recounted from a 'Note Book' by James Garner to Gena Rowlands (the older romantic couple) in flash backs. Rachel McAdams as the young Allie practically steals the show with her high and passionate spirit. Her talent is on a par with the generation of Renee Zellweger and a generation back Merril Streep. But the other performers are equally brilliant including particularly Ryan Gosling. Jamie Brown as Martha and James Marsten as Lon are both unforgettable. The scene with Martha, Allie, and Noah meeting at the door is superbly played by all. The emotions evinced by the actors is so convincing with so few words. One reason I particularly cared for this story is that it brought back memories of the summer romance of my wife and I more than 5 decades ago. Our romance ended more happily in that the summer ended with our engagement and marriage 3 months later.",The Notebook
1093,eli_lifeisbeautiful,A Beautiful Story that Pulls your Heartstrings,10,15 March 2015,"The Notebook is a movie that is eye caching because it is a fantasy of love that many couples certainly dream about. The love story of Noah and Allie is not altered by difference between social classes, remains a strong love even when challenged by an incurable disease, in this case Alzheimer's. The acting is realistic causing the audience to almost feel the chemistry between the two lovers. Ryan Gosling acts as Noah and Rachel McAdams acts as Allie; both of them became actors to look out for in the future after such performances in that movie. Appealing to the audience of teens and young adults, it won many awards at the Teens' Choice Awards the year after the movie was released. Some examples of the awards the movie won were Teen Choice Award for Best Movie Love Scene (2005), Teen Choice Award for Choice Date Movie (2005), and many more. The Notebook is a great movie because of the quality of acting, unique plot, emotions of the story, scenery, and runtime with no way to improve on it. The story may seem like a cliché story of two young lovers who fall in love and belong to different social classes, yet the thing that adds a twist to the story making it unique is the addition of Alzheimer's. One of the lovers begins to forget their relationship, but the other to help his sweetheart remember, writes a notebook to remind her of their story, remaining with her till their death. It is a story that can move some to tears since it appeals to emotion. Noah always being there, waiting for seven years for her, and building the house that Allie always dreamed off causes the audience to fall in love with his character. To him that house meant that there was still a chance for them to be reunited, even when the odds were against him, showing an undefeated hope. Later, Noah's love is challenged again, and James Garner did an amazing job portraying senior Noah. They are defied, and James portrays beautifully the emotions of a man that is not willing to give up, even to an illness that has no cure and everyday becomes worse. His wife losing her memory and forgetting even the love she has for him, to fight this he wrote in a notebook their story, and read their story to her to help her remember. His acting is so realistic, making the audience wonder why do they have to suffer again. Gena Rowlands, acting as senior Allie, was a wonderful performance that seems as if she is exactly like her character, a person who is nice and struggling to keep those special moments in her memory. The scenery helps the movie, adding to that romantic atmosphere. There are some sceneries that are common, such as parts of the movie in front of the beach, the waves splashing, and many birds fly through the air where the couple acts playfully in the water. One of the scenes that by itself makes the atmosphere dreamy is when Noah and Allie are in a canoe floating on the middle of a lake that is surrounded by trees. The water is being moved gently by the white ducks swimming in many directions, the light of the sun gently hitting the surface of the water, and a breeze moving their hair softly. Other places become romantic because of the actors. For example, when Allie and Noah are walking on the street at night and by doing little things, such as dancing under the stars in some street, there is no need for anything complex. A street and them humming a song while dancing is enough to create a moment that would be normal into one that becomes a special moment that would be enough to sweep some women off their feet. The runtime of 120 minutes does not matter that is long since every moment there is a momentum builder, making the viewer wonder how everything would be settled. Allie's development of Alzheimer's condition builds anticipation of the outcome. A movie that does not only show the sweet side of love where everything works out, the characters feel butterflies in their stomachs and romantic moments are shown. This film also shows the time where there are challenges, and the other person is there to support them, no matter what may be the result. The main characters struggle. Noah is strong when Allie's condition becomes worse to the point that she does not even remembers her grandchildren. A first love that will not die no matter how big the challenge is. There is never a dull moment since the actions of their love are harmoniously shown throughout the entire movie. This movie is characterized by a matchless plot because of that twist creates curiosity in the viewers. The acting is exceptional, draws audience into the story making the viewer see the main protagonists' power of will and love that is eternal. Emotions that are so powerful that seem to flow from the screen and be transmitted to the audience. Sentiment that make the audience sigh, smile and even move some of the viewers to tears. Those beautiful sceneries create moments that are almost magical. The run time is flawless, since the moments that normally would be simple, were transformed into opportunities to show how this couple with little things showed their love for each other. Also there was anticipation build up on how their destiny would turn out to be. The story of these lovers gives hope to young couples; proving that even when a relationship may face different types of problems, if they are both willing to work hard for that relationship, then their love will be able to defeat all those challenges. A movie worth the time of the audience for how wonderfully it was put together.",The Notebook

It is amazing to see how much a man respects the woman he loves and how he can dedicate his life to her. May sound sappy but every woman out there dreams of a man like that! See this movie if you want to see a quality movie and feel like there really is true love and amazing love still left in the world. The movie is great for men too, it is not really a chic flick. The acting in the movie is superb and the movie holds your attention! There are very few movies that are like this one, maybe Pearl Harbor (the newer one), maybe Serendipity, but none come close!

1095,earthgoat,The worst film I've seen in a decade,1,24 June 2005,"My wife and I watched The Notebook last night. Within ten minutes we were furious at how slow, cliché, and predictable it was. And then it just got worse and worse. It was so very very bad that we were actually drawn to watch in perverse, embarrassed horror as each scene plodded through stale, obvious dialog, and the actors tried to salvage what was obviously a terrible muddle by overacting. I can't begin to convey just how awful this movie is, in every sense. Leave aside the horrendously dull, cliché-ridden script, the terrible acting, the ham-fisted directing, the swelling tear-jerker music, and the incredibly obvious plot -- Even the freaking costumes were terrible. The fake facial hair looked like it was done by 3rd-graders. If movies are meant to fascinate, then this one did all right. I consider this the worst film I have seen in at least five years, but rarely if ever have I (and my wife) been compelled to stay all the way through such abysmal crap out of some sort of hilarious anger at how were were wasting our own time. I mean we were jumping on the couches ad screaming in warped glee as each predictable plot point was tediously checked off the director's checklist. All the way to the very last shot (in the backstory) of her coming back and them hugging in a swirl of stock sentimental string music -- OF COURSE SHE'S COMING BACK. And the front story? They, uh, die TOGETHER? My God. We could not stop howling. Was he even sick? No. He just died -- just because! Because it went with the sickeningly sweet music, I guess. Then I come here expecting to be vindicated and I find a bunch of comments by people who were actually taken in by this plodding, pathetic drivel. What in the world is up? I usually am with IMDb folks on their 7.8s, but man alive, folks, step away from the Kool-Aid.",The Notebook

Even if you don't normally watch this type of movie, go and see it. You'll surely not fail to be entertained, and you may well need a whole box of tissues - not that it's a sad movie by any means, just very moving.",The Notebook
1097,brandikcraven,my opinion of this movie,10,11 August 2005,"i personally just cant get over how much i love the notebook. it is a heartwarming tale of true love. which i think is hard to come by these days, not that it doesn't exist or that everyone doesn't have an equal chance at true love, just by the fact that i think a lot of people settle. they settle for less than they should. they get pregnant, they don't want to wait, they are over-come with feelings of love and newness that only evaporate after so long if you don't truly love a person. watching this movie, i became so captured up in the love story and what was going to happen with these 3 people (ally, noah and lon). for each character was loving in its own way. its hard to point out the villain in the story, some would say lon b/c everyone is rooting for noah. but lon really cares for ally just as noah does. i found her mom to be the villain by keeping them apart. this movie reminded me of the innocence of first love, which wasn't that long ago, and how things don't always turn out the way you had planned. sometimes its hard to follow your heart but its even harder to go through life thinking of how you could have changed it.",The Notebook

1099,Boobear112,Awesome,10,29 June 2005,"I actually don't really like love stories, but for some reason I was drawn to it. I fell in love with a love story. I love the whole theory of a poor man winning over the heart of a socialite. I love the whole idea of the mother going through the same thing her daughter went through, only choosing the wrong path from her daughter. And out of all of it, how their love kept them together, even in death. When watching this movie, you just stayed glued to it, and it's awesome because it doesn't revolve around the sexual side of relationships. It shows how one person never gave up on his love, when she became sidetracked with another. How for so many years he kept her promise to her!",The Notebook
1100,dweaver-1,The Notebook,10,30 June 2005,I read The Notebook before I saw the movie and I absolutely fell in love with the book and the character of Noah Taylor Calhoun. I wasn't able to see the movie while it was in theaters and I was SO MAD. Then it finally came out on DVD and I rented it over Valentines Day weekend and watched it at least three times before I decided I HAD to have this movie. I bought it the same weekend and have watched it so much ever since. Ryan Gosling was PERFECT for the character of Noah and he is absolutely HOT. The movie is a little different from the book but it still my favorite movie. It is THE BEST love story I have EVER seen and that includes TITANIC and Nicholas Sparks other book and movie A WALK TO REMEMBER. THE NOTEBOOK will always remain a beautiful love story.,The Notebook
1101,bad_baby2003_,Wow!,10,30 July 2005,"When The Notebook first came out in theatres, I thought to myself,""great another mushy-gushy film."" But when my friend and I decided to see a movie, there was little selection. So after complaining a lot, I caved in and went and saw the movie. As the previews came on, I kept thinking that I should run out of the theatre. When the movie was over I couldn't believe how extraordinary and moving the performance was. As the summer neared to an end, my friends and I all got together for our usual back to school meeting just to make sure we didn't buy the same clothes. During our usual meeting, 6 out of my 7 friends had seen it and absolutely loved it(the other one had been at camp so she didn't have a chance to see any movies.)We all decided to go see it again and came out of the theatre crying even though we had all seen it before. After that movie came out, I cant imagine a movie even being as close to perfect as this one was.",The Notebook
1102,xonicky0201ox,The Notebook was AWESOME!,10,8 July 2005,"Even thought it may have been a classic love story, The Notebook was unlike any other movie I have ever seen. These two young children in love is enough to warm any cold heart. It is for certain a tear jerker, so ladies, bring a box of tissues if you're going to watch it. But don't think The Notebook is just a chick flick. It may be a tear jerker, but it also has a sense of humor. Guys and people of all ages will enjoy it, from young to old. It was THE best movie I've ever had the pleasure to watch, and I'm dead serious. I've seen it about 5 times now and it never gets old. I cry every time! I'm probably always going to love this movie, no matter how old I become. I HIGHLY recommend it for anyone who loves an awesome romantic comedy.",The Notebook
1103,jesskook,it's a tearjerker,10,8 July 2005,"I'm not usually a crier, but this movie made me shed some tears. If your looking for a release, this love story is perfect for a good cry. The actors are excellent! This is a movie for all ages of lovers. Gena Rowlands and James Garner are well-known classic actors who caught my Mom's interest to see this movie. The new actors who play young Allie and Noah catch the interest of the younger age group, especially after winning their MTV award for best kiss on screen. The format of the movie keeps you interested because it switches from present day to the past and back again. The plot consists of real life drama which is suspenseful enough to keep you glued to the screen to see what happens next. I recommend this movie to everyone whom has ever been love.",The Notebook
1104,check_ya_later_99,A true romantic movie!,10,9 July 2005,"I love Ryan gosling and he was excellent in this movie. I am so happy of the way the movie turned out. I cried in some parts and smiled with affection in others. It was an all round great movie i loved it and i would recommend it to anyone. All the casts performances were great, but the performance that grabbed my intention the best was Ryan's, he well and truly is a great actor and a hot-tie if you don't mind me adding! The writer of the novel wrote a great story and I'm surely going to read the novel as most do they see the movie they read the book. The setting of this movie was also fantastic, very 40's style. The whole movie was so realistic, even i thought i was back in the 1940's, a very romantic era. I loved the fact that Noah and Allie first met at a carnival and the fact that Noah put his life at risk to get Allie's attention. The time they spent together was really the summer of anyones dreams. Love does come from a great story. I'll finish off by saying well done to all the cast and crew for a fantastic job on a fantastic movie.",The Notebook
1105,chelseacowling,Truly beautiful,10,18 August 2015,"I watched this film for the first time today, and wow, it is truly remarkable. The sincerity in Noah (Ryan Gosling) and Allie (Rachel Mcadams) is astounding. The acting is beautiful and really makes you believe that they were in love. The plot is really quite simple but extremely affective, the old man Noah (James Garner) is reading a book to the old lady Allie (Gena Rowlands) about their life (due to her having Alzheimer's disease) to try make her remember the beautiful memories they shared as a couple. It really came as a shock to me when Allies mother revealed that she too was in love with a 'country boy' as that was unexpected from her being so against Noah and Allie being together but once that scene was presented it some how fell into place and made the story more understandable as to why she wanted her to make the 'right choice' afterwords. The scenes in the film which really tugged on my heart strings were when Allie came back to see Noah after realizing he'd made the house how she wanted and defying her fiancé just so she could be with Noah and reminisce on old memories. Although when they fought due to her fiancé looking for her and she chose to go see her fiancé I was in complete floods of tears thinking 'no!! How could you do this Allie he's in love with you' and all through the scene of her driving back to 'Seabrook inn' I was also in floods of tears with her until a sigh of relief wept over me when she returned to Noah. The final scene which really made me wail is the end scenes strictly focused on the old Allie and Noah, when Noah makes a recovery from the hospital and sneaks away to go see his wife and remarkably she remembers him, then when he lays next to her holds her hand and they fall asleep peacefully it is beautiful. The final scene is definitely the most upsetting of them all, the nurse comes in to the room to find Noah and Allie asleep together with Allie looking majorly pale she then touches her hand and it's evident that either Allie passed away or both passed away and that was it I just could not stop crying, this beautiful scene was the final piece of the story and it couldn't have been made in a better way. It summed up their love for each other. The only negative comment I have for this film is they could of made the scene in the war a little more sincere when Fin gets hit by a bomb, I don't think they spent enough time on it and jumped straight into Allie being in the hospital as a nurse. Overall this film is a romance which no woman or man should ever want to miss, but you should definitely get some tissues ready! 10 out of 10 it's truly beautiful.",The Notebook
1106,vickychetan,The Notebook is a brilliantly written intriguing story about two young lovers that most people can relate to.,10,24 August 2015,"The Notebook is a brilliantly written intriguing story about two young lovers that most people can relate to. The movie describes how a summer love turned into a pure and inseparable love. The movie is filled with fabulous quotes and sentimental moments which makes people get lost in the story, and forget about their thoughts, or what is going on in the outside world.The movie was adapted from the novel ""The Notebook"" by Nicholas Sparks. Nick Cassavetes directed the movie, making a great adaption. Ryan Gosling brings a great innocence to the role of Noah Calhoun in the film, one of the two main characters. Rachel McAdams plays the other half of the duo as Allie Hamilton. They both gave an astonishing performances along with James Garner who plays old Noah and Gena Rowlands who plays old Allie.The old Allie has a disease called Alzheimer's which makes her forget about her old life, particularly her husband and the life they had spent together. The story unfolds as Old Noah reads her ""The Notebook"" comprising of their young love, how they met, how they fell in love, how their love grew.Noah and Allie gave a remarkably convincing portrayal of a boy and a girl traveling down a very long road with no regard for the consequence of their unconditional love. Noah is a country boy, Allie is from city. Being from a wealthy family, she had the world at her feet while he didn't have two dimes to rub together. With Noah, Allie is a completely different person. She sees her life differently and does what she likes rather than what her parents wants for her. She is like a free bird flying high up in the sky, enjoying her life to the fullest. One of the narration of the movie says, ""The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach out for more, that plants a fire in our heart and brings peace to our minds"". That's what they gave each other and that's what people want in their life.It does not matter whether you love romantic movies or hate them, this is NOT just a romantic movie it is so more than that. By the end of the movie you will feel a whole heap of emotions. It leaves it viewers to talk about the movie for a long time. This was one of the best movies I recently saw and would highly recommend to see this epic tale of love.",The Notebook
1107,nicenrich,Rachel McAdams was exceptional,9,12 July 2005,"Rachel McAdams did an exceptional job in this movie. She has serious acting talent as judged by this performance. I am looking forward to seeing her in future films. She made this character's emotions and feelings come across as well as any actress in her profession.The classic love triangle dilemma with of course the well-meaning mother intervening to steer her daughters decisions about true love and happiness. A good story, well directed and acted. The sets were wonderful and the photography also excellent.The movie is long at 123 minutes but it did not seem long at all. It is well paced and did not seem to drag, as it seems to me so often happens in this genre (well at least for men).",The Notebook
1108,australia42,beautiful all around,10,13 July 2005,"The Notebook is the best movie of it's kind. It isn't just for the hopeful romantics, it supplies beauty all around. It has a glorious soundtrack as well as scenery, camera-work, and most importantly the script and especially the acting. Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling give the best performance of their careers so far. This enriching story is bound to make both genders cry, but an interesting kind of tear. The very last scene is the most heartbreaking but also the sweetest giving off a mixed chemically dazzling effect. You can never be the same after watching this film. It may sound like the biggest cliché - poor guy falls for rich girl, they fall in love, she has to go away - but it's so much more with all the other aspects of the movie combined. The Notebook is incredibly moving and you will never have the same look on love after watching it.",The Notebook
1109,Jeff_81,A first love that becomes lifelong,9,14 July 2005,"One of the things about a film with intelligent, realistic dialog and superb acting is that the viewer easily becomes deeply involved in the story. The viewer, in essence, becomes part of the story. The Notebook is that kind of film. You will relive your first love in detail again. You will feel the longing, the passion the pure emotion that you felt. I'm 42 now and the story of my first love could have become the script for this film, as I'm sure could have many other viewers, but I haven't re-experienced the intensity of emotions that I felt during that period in the way that this film helped me to feel. I cried at the end of the film because of the beauty of the love story on screen and because of the sadness of our life situations. I also cried because it reminded me of the unsatisfied longing I have to experience that pure love; you see, in the script of my love story, we parted and never did rejoin. I often think about her and wonder if she feels as I still do. I will always love her.",The Notebook
1110,earlcenac,A Great Love Story,10,19 July 2005,"I saw this movie July 17 2005 on TV and thought it to be one of the greatest love movies I have ever seen. It reminds me a lot of ""Splendor in the Grass"" another great love movie. Funny, those great movies you tend to watch alone.I was sitting in the living room alone watching it and never left my seat for a minute. I was glued. ""Splendor in the Grass"" I remember, I was in the cinema with three of my friends and we were the only ones in the cinema. We thought that the movie was so bad that nobody wanted to watch it. We however decided to stay. What a great decision. What a great movie. The notebook has that same kind of appeal. I loved it. I could watch it again.I wish we could have more of this kind of movie on TV instead of what we now see with all the violence and otherwise.",The Notebook
1111,annegutenberg,Could have been better,5,16 November 2015,"The main flaw of the movie and its literary source is originality. A unsuccessful attempt imitation of ''Bridges of Madison County'' by Robert James Waller (and later film adaptation of Clint Eastwood). The film does not possess a fraction of sincerity nor the cognitive nor the emotional level. Acting on the amateur level, full emotional turns and worn-out cliché dialog. This does not mean that Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams do not possess remarkable acting talents! Simply, the lack of such a scenario has given this final product. What deserves praise are a lot of good shots of nature and solid costumes. We expected to 'swallow' what it is served on the big screen and to accept it as art. In fact, commercial, disingenuous and intellectually insulting.",The Notebook

1114,short_arse_100,Magical,10,22 January 2006,"At first the film starts with a slow opening: easing you into the film. This alone was a reason to change the channel and watch something else. But something about it drew me in and kept me watching. But within 3 minutes I was glad I was still watching the film. The lives of the two main characters couldn't be any more different, but isn't that the whole point of a love story? The film takes you on a journey of the characters lives, showing not only the good moments but the bad as well. Just when your about to give up on the couple, and admit that not all love stories have a happy ending. The film bounces back to life and shows that nothing can stand in the way of true love. Just as you begin to be overcome with joy, you find yourself tearing up towards the end. I don't want to give too much away but its so happy its sad I found myself in hysterics while the credits rolled. All I wanted was to rewind and watch it again...obviously with TV its practically impossible so I bought the DVD this morning, in order to feed my hunger for it. I recommend this film to anyone. You don't have to enjoy romances to really get into this film, its more than a chick flick, its a work of art...a beautiful film.",The Notebook

However, the Notebook drew me into the story from the beginning right up until the credits- and then kept me crying for quite some time after it had ended. I, along with almost every other person i have discussed the movie with, felt involved in the situations and the lives of the character- crying at the sad moments and feeling joy at the happy bits. in general, love stories are predictable and somewhat dull (in my opinion) yet this movie kept me guessing at the outcome, and delivered twists throughout the whole film.The Notebook was extremely well constructed and i would give it an eleven out of ten. It really played with my emotions and i loved it..",The Notebook

This is the unconditional love that everyone should be looking for if they haven't found it already. I haven't and I'm still hoping, but hope is the last that dies. The Notebook just reminded me of what I do and do not want in my life. All these ridiculous things like Tinder and such do not give you what you need. If you want to find love you need to fight for it like Noah does. And you may not let go again. Ever. Thank you Nicholas Sparks and Nick Cassavetes for creating this wonderful piece of art.

I honestly didn't like Rayan Goseling play I would say he could've done better, but I ve enjoyed everything else the pictures the soundtrack and the way I felt when I was watching it, made me happy when it's happy and I was crying when it was sad, I really loved it till the end.",The Notebook

This is definitely one of them. The vow (2012 I think,don't want to remember) was another one. This movie would have made more sense in the 20s, but by now, audiences are too smart and too experienced.

Oh yes, I read some of the comments about the birds at the end, when Noan and Allie ""passed on"", please read the sequel to the movie, ""The Wedding"". It is a must read, I hope they will make a movie out of it, and will use the same cast. (Would ruin it otherwise) That would be a Godsend. It is so heartwarming from the beginning of ""The Notebook"", to the end of ""The Wedding"". This story enlightens a persons inner soul. Should have won all the awards that year.

The story is very touching and inspiring to single people who have not found their true love. This movie reminds people of how love should be treated and how wonderful it can be if you work hard for the one you love. The best part of the movie is the scene when Noah and Allie are in the boat together for the first time after parting for 7 years and it starts to rain. They take the boat to the pier and Allie starts talking about why Noah had not written her over the past 7 years. Noah lets her know that he wrote her 365 letters (One for every day for a year). Allie tells Noah that it wasn't over for her and then Noah has the ultimate come back saying... It wasn't over and it still isn't over!!! When he grabs her to kiss her after saying those words is UNFORGETTABLE! Rachel and Ryan would make the best couple in real life. They look as though they have natural chemistry. I think that's why people can feel the love expressed in the movie. There is not another couple that can make you believe their character's role like they do.",The Notebook

The young new actor who plays NOAH is the best new player I've seen in a long time. The setting was beautiful and the cinematography is excellent.

I didn't know how it was going to end, but I had not thought of how it did end, with them dying in each others arms. It is so sad but also it is good as you know they are together for ever, not how they were in real life with Allie's condition. It was also great how it was set in the olden days you got to see how everything was.

1130,songwriterrc,Philosophically Inconsistent,2,30 December 2016,"Let's consider the themes:* Money ~ The movie portrays the hopelessness of both males caught up between a hopeless girl who couldn't hold onto her own integrity, and yet considered that she could find peace ultimately in either of her choices. So although she may remain authentic to the poor guy, she won't stay with him, however if she stays with the rich guy, the rich guy could never receive her love.Wonder if people should rather explore the grave themes of how capitalism has torn apart the social healthiness of our society, and the lack of women empowerment -_- I mean shouldn't she just do her own work, buy her own house, develop her own ways to sustenance? That way she'd at least be in a better shape to make a worthy decision... At least she won't be implicated to make a choice she doesn't truly want to go for.* Concept of Love So we have a whole bunch of movies based upon love stories like these where people correlate love with a sense of intuition, without concept, thus as we'd say 'Blind in Love'. So blind, that there is no love to be seen anywhere around. I mean the girl could love the guy, and fail to make a point to her parents as to why it's valuable to her, and even though if she fails, at least she could have some regard for the concerns her parents may have about her, they do after all care for her, she could deal with the situation with lesser repulsion and by being much more considerate and open to a proper fruitful discussion (Although yes we have exactly the same happening in reality, where usually situations go haywire, and we could always attribute that to these movies which failed to cause a change anyway. What is that love which takes all the lovely people away from one's life?) ... I mean how come we always end up having one love destroy another, that's not universalizable, it's principally immoral.* Dealing with Loss and Crisis The movie portrays the only way of dealing with a crisis, due to a loss or let alone that of a loss of existential purpose, but that too of prioritizing one's values all upon the end of living through a sense of bonding with another (and that too being a SPECIFIC person)... Guess it's time we got to face it, and find better ways that arouses in us a sense of fulfillment without having to use others as a means to that end. That is just IMMORAL!",The Notebook

I insisted that my fiancé buy this DVD for me and when we sat down to watch it together even he was blown away by the story.

In all honestly, I didn't expect it to be this good, but nevertheless, there were only two things I didn't like about it. It's an amazing film and deserves it's awards, but I felt like it didn't impact fully on me because firstly, I expected the famous Notebook kiss to be at the end, but it wasn't. Lastly, I fell in love with Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams' portrayal of the characters and therefore the ending didn't have much impact on me.

The first time I saw it I cried hysterically and even after it ended I was still crying.. I couldn't stop thinking about it. I still cry every time I watch it. Its the perfect love story, I suggest EVERYONE goes out and rents it. I think both Rachel & Ryan were really great. Their chemistry was just.. wow. They made me want to have my life end up that way. I think they are both wonderful actors, and I cant wait to see more of their movies. The supporting cast was great too. Everything about this movie was so.. wonderful. I'd also like to say Nicholas Sparks is a genius for writing the novel in the first place. Without him, this movie would have never came to be.",The Notebook

If you'd like to watch a classic love story, with nothing new with no originality please choose this title. It was the worst experience ever. The characters were not very well chosen, and the storyline is too obvious. The script is poorly written. Not to mention that the writer of the book ""Note book"" is very conventional writer. I don't know how our society accepts a film with no creative spirit. I really think that this would be a great movie for maybe for relaxing time, but there is no need to really involve thinking as a matter of fact. It was a bad experience for me and I would never want to encounter such movies again, would like to stay away from romance genre, if people are calling this a romance movie.",The Notebook

I don't know if anyone else felt this way,but I was finding myself wishing I was Allie.I mean not only because Ryan Gosling is drop dead gorgeous,but you want a man to love you that much, even though you went away for 14 years,and haven't heard a word since,still build her dream house hoping and praying it'll make her come back. Writing her letters EVERY DAY for a year, actually showing a woman that you love her.... even though I'm taken I'm so incredibly in love with Ryan Gosling.... =) I think Nicholas Sparks is a wonderful author and I'm so happy he wrote this book so it can be made into the best movie I've seen. I actually made my fiancé sit down and watch this movie with me. He was griping the entire way to the movie store, all the way back home, the beginning credits but then once the movie started going I noticed he began to get VERY quiet and I began to talk in the middle of the movie right before Noah and Allie's second love scene on the dock and he actually ""shushed"" me to keep watching it.

The story that he reads is about a young working man Noah Calhoun from the lower class, and young wealthy girl Allie Hamilton. They meet each other at the fair where he instantly falls in love with her. After spending some time together, they both realize that they are meant for each other. However, because of the social class difference, the girl's mother disapproves their relationship, and Allie leaves the Seabrook Island.

Noah was then sent to fight in the war and the relationship seemed to be on hold. Noah would write to Allie every day and would not receive any replies from all his letters. This is mainly because of her parents hiding the letters that were sent. Allie would soon meet another very well off man named Lon Hammond Jr who was played by James Marsden. This was obviously approved by her parents as he was very wealthy and were ecstatic when they become engaged. Soon after Noah returned home from the war he would then return to his home and attempt to fix his home in an effort to pursued Allie to want to be with him.

Allie would at that point chose to leave Noah and pick to be with Lon. When she goes to Lon and confesses all the things she has done with Noah. Lon forgives Allie for all the things she has done but in the end, she ends up picking to be with Noah. The Notebook is written by Nickolas Sparks who also wrote another love story called Dear John (2010). This is similar to The Notebook as it also was similar in showing how war can affect relationships. Throughout the film there were many types of techniques used in order to show the theme of the movie. Some of the widely-used techniques included lighting and the angles of the scenes. Low levels of lightning were used for sad scenes where there were tough decisions made and sad moments. The film also excelled at using bright lighting for the parts of the film where there was happiness. This was to accentuate the scene and show the level of emotion that was being portrayed. There are many types of camera angles that were used in the film. The main styles of angle include close up and wide angle. There were many serious points of the movie where close angle shots were used to show intimacy between the characters. Also, the wide angle was used to show the environment in the scenes. The film is a wonderful love story where Noah and Allie find a way to love each other even when there are a lot of factors that are preventing them from being with each other.",The Notebook
1140,writer111-1,"Good Guy Gets the Good Girl, Forever",9,6 October 2005,"THE NOTEBOOK is the film version of the mega tear-jerker romance novel of the same name by the best-selling author Nicholas Sparks. Nick Cassevetes (son of John C.) directed his mom and a fine cast including good'old James Garner for this truly romantic movie shot at incredibly beautiful locations in South Carolina.Two kids (the handsome Ryan Gosling as NOAH and the radioactively attractive Rachel McAdams as ALLIE) from wrong ends of the social spectrum fall in love despite the vociferous objection of the girl's super rich family.The girl leaves town for Sarah Lawrence College while the boy continues to work at a lumberyard. Then there is WW2. The boy goes to fight in Europe. His letters (365 letters in 365 days) are conveniently hidden from ALLIE by her manipulative and class-conscious mother. So ALLIE, giving up hope on NOAH, decides to marry the handsome son of the cotton king of south, a boy she meets as a wounded soldier when she volunteers as a nurse to help the ailing vets in hospital.After coming back home, NOAH refuses to quit dreaming about ALLIE and builds the home he promised long time ago to her as their future home.Just before the wedding, ALLIE sees the house and a bearded and older NOAH posing in front of it in her local paper -- and she just flat passes out in front of a dozen ooohing and aaaahing southern dames while trying out her spectacular wedding gown! Then she visits NOAH for a very hot encounter and after a few more twists (will she? won't she?), she decides to forgo the millions of the cotton king and live her life with the working class NOAH as his wife.Now, this story is actually told by a much older NOAH in a nursing home to his wife ALLIE, the same kids just grown very old, in an attempt to cure ALLIE's dementia by reading her the NOTEBOOK she kept for all those years -- the very story of their love that is told in long flashbacks.At the end, despite some lapses, she manages to regain her memory and the movie ends with a Mother of All Tear Jerkers final scene. If you don't cry during this movie, just forget it. You never will.What a relief in this day and age of terrorism and business scandals and hurricanes and global warming to watch a story of pure mad love, holding over decades despite all odds, sticking around for ages and for a lifetime. It would be unbearable to watch this kind of a movie everyday. I still need my CHINATOWN, BLOOD SIMPLE by Coen Brothers, for example, or CRASH by Paul Haggis. But I'm also very glad that unabashedly romantic writers like Nicholas Sparks do exist. We are all fortunate that he is not selling pharmaceuticals for a living anymore.

I would recommend this film to anyone of any age it was extremely enjoyable.the acting was superb and very believable. the plot of the film was very clever. the only flaw in the film was that they gave away to much too soon and could have told you certain things more subtlety before giving away who the characters were etc.,The Notebook

I felt physically sick while watching this garbage, because I have been manipulated in similar ways by people who claimed that they loved me, when all they loved was the fact that I would do as they said out of fear of never having the chance to find someone else.Watch it, if you must, but be aware that the book has a healthier way of showing how a long and happy life of love can be built by a couple and understand that love should be healthy, making you happy.

1145,angelbelle212,Story behind true love.,10,29 October 2005,"Ryan Gosling (Noah) and Rachel McAdams (Allie) are two young adults who find true love one summer, against all odds. He is a poor kid and shes the rich girl. This starts out as a basic rich girl/ poor boy, Romeo and Juliet kind of thing. Her parents don't want her with him and so forth. They beat those odds and that love grew and changed their lives. This love at times was...1. Sweet, where you see them together at the beach when Allie tells Noah ""Now say you're a bird too."" and he responds ""If you're a bird, I'm a bird."" 2. Forbidden, when Allie's mom argues with her saying ""She will wind up with her heart broken or pregnant! Now he's a nice boy, but he's..."" Allie asks ""He's WHAT? He is what? Tell me!"" and her mother responds with determination ""He is trash! Trash! Trash! Not for you!"" 3. This movie shows all sides of love, even close to obsession. There are parts of the movie where Noah buys a house and works on it day in and day out just the way he promised Allie he would, even though he just saw her through a window kissing another guy (who happened to be her fiancé).One of my favorite scenes in the movie, the day after Noah and Allie broke up, Noah wrote her a letter and one everyday after that for a year. They meet up and he tells her how much he still needs her and loves her by bringing up those letter... Allie ""Why didn't you write me? Why? It wasn't over for me, I waited for you for seven years. But now its too late."" Noah ""I wrote you 365 letters. I wrote you everyday for a year."" Allie ""You wrote me?"" Noah ""Yes... it wasn't over, it still isn't over."" The story is told in two parts. Young love that grows and old love that rekindles. Allie as an adult played by Gena Rowlands has the disease Alzheimer's, so an older Noah played by James Garner reads to her every day from a book she wrote herself about their love. Hoping she will remember one day about their love Noah sits there and sees his true love stare back at him as a stranger, you see his emotions, how this is killing him but he still does it in hopes that his Allie will come back to him. Garner did an excellent job in this film, though his scenes were short, he narrorates the film and you can hear it in his voice what Noah felt those times. You come to feel for him and hope it ends well.My favorite lines in this movie are just a couple of words said twice in this movie. ""I'll be seeing you"" also the title of my favorite song in the movie.It first appears at the end of Noahs first letter to Allie... ""My Dearest Allie. I couldn't sleep last night because I know that it's over between us. I'm not bitter any more, because I know that what we had was real. And if in some distant place in the future we see each other in our new lives, I'll smile at you with joy and remember how we spent the summer beneath the trees, learning from each other and growing in love. The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more, that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds, and that's what you've given me. That's what I hope to give to you forever. I love you. I'll be seeing you. Noah"" And at the end of the movie when Adult Allie asks Noah ""Do you think our love can make miracles?"" and Noah responds ""I do."" He then climbs into bed with her, she says good night, he says good night and then he says ""I'll be seeing you."" The next scene is when the nurse finds them both close together holding hands on Allies small twin size bed, at first it seems as if they are asleep, but they both passed away.A love that can go through so much and still be there in the end. Thats the first time I've seen a love like this in a story or movie. It was a pleasure seeing this movie and its one of my treasured DVD's. It gets ten and a half stars from me if I could get that half star in there. Well done, beautiful cinematography, the script, the acting, the story. Good job.",The Notebook

It goes in depth about the lives of these two people who are clearly meant for one another. This is a story that will stay with you for a long time.

It made me laugh, made me cry, made me sad and a whole lot more feelings. Not only was the Notebook great because of what it was about, but what also contributed to how great it was were the characters. The producer could not have chosen a better couple; Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams make the perfect couple and are brilliant together. (James Garner and Gena Rowlands were also great.)In the movie, when Allie Hamilton (McAdams)first met Noah Calhoan (Gosling) she did not think much of him. However Noah was struck by Allie's beauty, I would say it was love at first sight for Noah. Throughout the movie Noah tries getting a date with Allie but she plays hard to get. Noah however finally sneaks to a date with Allie and after that night, they got to know each other better, Allie and Noah were unseparateable. Unfortunately, Noah was not the man Allie's parents wanted their daughter to marry. Many, many more things that were happy, that were sad and made me cry occurred after that. You must watch this movie that my boyfriend and I can't stop watching. I have watched it four times and I am still not tired of it.

The main actors are Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams who perform the role of two lovers who had a beautiful relationship. The film is a flashback because in the present the woman has Alzheimer, so the man tells her the story to remember her past. The positive things of the film are that it is based on a true story and it is very passionate. It shows the real love between the couple because the man always tries to help her and he stays by her side till her death. The negative things are that in the beginning you can suspect that the couple in the present is the same as the story which he is telling. To sum up, we highly recommend this movie because it's very realistic and makes you feel crazy in love.",The Notebook

That revisit was not only a pleasure.What struck me first was probably the film's strongest aspect: it is a dazzling range of pretty pictures and a hot romance. But all that
potential magic gets undermined by minor and major flaws in the story. Of course this story is super romantic and in that sense, it gets away with a perfectly burning fireplace, early in the morning, when both lovers are clearly asleep. I would really like to learn that trick. More stupid is the portrayal of Alzheimer's in the film: obviously, the disease serves the purpose of filling a plot hole, which had been ok, had it been done properly. Let's not mention that even World War Two is misused way too lightly. Stereotypes in overdrive.The Notebook is easy on the eye, and convinces as long as you don't think about what actually goes on.",The Notebook

1152,hexelf,Shallow and sugar coated to the point of becoming disturbing,1,15 December 2007,"It's not that I dislike romance anything but this has movie tries so hard to be some sort of acronym to the word ""chick flick"" that it ends up shooting you to death with it's intended love arrows. Now could it be that I can't relate the alleged lovers in this movie? I mean I wasn't born in the 30s, I'm not a soldier so I was never in any wars (haven't we seen enough WW2 stories by the way?) and of course I don't have any family as of yet. But surely the universal power love is something everyone can relate to? Especially when depicted by a movie that uses no other element to drive its plot. Think again, the definition of love shown in this film is so naive, sugar-coated and completely oblivious of anything in the real world that it makes Star Wars look like something from the Discovery channel.The so called ""couple"" in this film are only in love because the movie says they are, not because there's any sort of chemistry between the actors and not because the characters themselves even act like. Even Allie's alleged interest in painting felt so tacked on shallow and fake it made my head hurt. Speaking of Allie, it actually infuriates me to see the character acting like she has absolutely no control over her libido because the sex is just about the only thing the couple seems to have in common, and the only thing, aside from arguing, that they enjoy doing together. And yet this movie is supposed to be oh so romantic.It's by some small miracle that this movie got the raving reviews it did, luckily it seems most of those were given by teenage girls and their tool boyfriends (no Oscars or anything) so I don't have to completely give up on humanity yet. If one day your girlfriend suddenly shows up all lyrical about this movie and wants it to ""share it with you"" I'd strongly advise any guy to end that relationship pronto. Your girlfriend will obviously already have built up her own twisted fantasy of what a relationship should be like, a fantasy that no guy, live or dead, could possibly live up to.

Rachel McAdams was great and you could appreciate the difficulties she went through with her parents and true love, but in my opinion Ryan Gosling was amazing, and you could really feel the pain and love he felt for Rachels character Allie. The overall flow of the film was good too, with the balance between the story teller (James Garner) and the actual story being just right.

1161,clifto-18832,*Spoiler Alert*,8,14 December 2017,"""The Notebook"" (2004) is a great love story about Noah, Ryan Gosling and Allie, Rachel McAdams based off of the famous novel written by Nicholas Sparks. The film is the story of how Noah and Allie met and their lives together being read later in life out of journal by Noah to Allie while she is suffering from Alzheimer's. 
 This story is your normal cliché love story that everyone loves. The guy chasing after a girl, her parents not approving and in the end the two of them fall in love and live a happy life. In the beginning Allie meets Noah at a local carnival. Noah spends most of his time throughout the film trying to convince Allie to fall in love with him and convince her parents that he is good enough for her, although he is a boy from the other side of town. Quickly, Allie falls into him and their story continues despite her parent's approval. Allie's mother is the one who causes much of the problems in this film. She sets them up to begin fighting in many different way and eventually to stop talking all together while Allie moves away for school.
 While she is away Noah continues to love her, and try his best to contact her throughout many years apart. He builds their dream home and goes out of his way to make sure that they could rekindle the fire that was once there. 
 A few years later, Allie and Noah run into each other and it all unravels. Everything that Noah had done, all of the letters that you later find out Allies mother had been hiding. They fall in love all over again until the day that they are sitting there while Noah is reading to Allie while she doesn't remember. The movie closes with the two of them having the ends of their lives together just like it always should have been. 
 So, in conclusion while wanting to watch this movie, expect it to be your average Nicholas Sparkes film just like these others; safe heaven, the longest ride and the best of me etc.",The Notebook
1162,vnt51,Why not the best love story of all time?!,10,16 August 2006,"What does a movie need to be magnificent?What does it need to earn the title ""Greatest love story of all time""? The answer is pure simplicity-a great story.And this is what this movie is all about.The simple,but greatest love story we have ever seen.A story,which captures you from the very beginning and never let's you go.This feeling,which you get,while watching the movie-this is what it makes it the best told story about love and commitment. A lot of people can easily say that the plot of the movie is too simple to be a masterpiece.But does a great thing need to be complicated in order to captivate your mind forever?I think not.And I am sure that a lot of people would agree with me.The simplicity of the story makes it so emotional for everyone,who watches the movie.The fact that a love like that is not impossible,but as easy as it looks it still it is a task,which lies ahead of everyone and it is not a easy one.But once you succeed in it and see the fruit of your everyday care and love-then you will know it was all worth it. What else can I say about this movie?The actors were as great as they could be.They are one of the main reasons why the story gets inside of everyone's hearts.A extraordinary piece of acting by Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling,and everyone else from the crew of the movie.Great directing,although we see things we have already seen is other movies,but not presented to us like this.Not with the same excellent love story of Noah and Allie.The story that will always remain in my heart and memory.The greatest love story of all time.",The Notebook

Later he had proposed and i got married! Then out of nowhere i saw him! My 1st love! I could not believe my eyes! when i had confronted him with anger, he told me that he had called me but no one gave me the messages! he told me that he was sad for the choices i had made in life and that he loved me so much!

THis movie hits home for different reasons, but does anybody think that she ends up with Lon and not Noah? I know that the producers made some scenes that got deleted that lean towards her marrying Lon, and Noah waits 50 years, at which time Lon dies and Noah comes to the assisted living home to try and make ALLy remember there love they shared so long ago. I keep watching the movie and listening for clues, and there are some. Like when the nurse tells the Old Noah that his kids are there, and Ally says, ""children"". THe nurse replied, ""not yours, his"" Yet the same scene it seems like the kids are in fact Ally's as well, giving you the clue that they did end up together and she didn't end up with Lon. Why does she tell Lon, ""I already know that I should be with you"" when she is planning to go and choose Noah? Help me, this movie consumes a lot of my thoughts lately. A great film, guys, watch it, its amazing.",The Notebook

I LOVED THIS MOVIE, this is even more strange since I read the book before seeing the movie and I actually preferred the movie (which has never happened before!).There are no falling in love clichés in the movie which gives the movie a fresh feel.The chemistry between the Ryan Gosling (Noah) and Rachel McAdams (Allie) is absolutely incredible. SO incredible that I can literally watch the movie three times in a row and can still get caught up in the emotions of the movie every time!! Everyone needs to see this movie!!!",The Notebook
1166,Dizzydean,James Garner and Gena Rowlands were wonderful in this very touching motion picture!,10,31 December 2005,"I may be the only man who saw this movie and cried, but I doubt it. I have been a James Garner fan for many years and loved his work with Gena Rowlands in this picture. The story touched me because having had an ailing parent with dementia, I sadly understand the frustration of wanting to share love with the individual who doesn't recognize you. Jim's acting was so appropriate, so sincere, and so right as usual. I will definitely add this to my DVD collection and will watch on those special times when I miss mom. In particular, this was a good movie for Jim, because he seemed to be just himself; a demeanor of independence on the outside, but deep inside, very caring. Great story and great leading actors. Keep up the wonderful work!",The Notebook
1167,taliahebert,Simply romantic,9,9 August 2018,"It's not wonder why the novels and the films written by perhaps one of the greatest romance novelists in history, are so popular. This film, particularly, explores genuine themes of love and death, presenting the idea that love is worth fighting for. Using mise-en-scene, visual elements within the camera's frame focuses on telling the story, evoking sensory emotions through common human feelings and experiences. There are noticeable melodramatic clichés following the irony of rich, reputative girl falls for poor, hardworking boy - both from opposite ends of the social spectrum. Alongside the difficulty and distress of Allie's parents' disapproval, tearing the two apart, you really admire the sentimentality of the story, especially as Noah contests for Allie throughout most of the storyline. The two reignite their incessant, passionate love following Allie's engagement with another man. 
The seamless weaving of the elderly man and woman in the present with Noah and Allie's connection in the past, makes their romance even more classic. It is evident that Ryan Gosling (Noah) and Rachel McAdams (Allison ""Allie"") have a strong connection, thus consistently providing the viewers with realistic aspect of love; including the positives and negatives. The main actors, Gosling and McAdams, perceive their characters very well, emotionally and physically throughout the film. 
This story isn't just narrow and straightforward, there are twists and ultimatums, thus making the story even more meaningful and engaging. Watching this film never fails to provide the audience with an exploding mixture of emotions.",The Notebook

It has a great meaning to it and i would definitely recommend it ! It is so fantastic the actors and actresses are just brilliant and it wouldn't be the same without them. This movie is a romantic film and warms your heart. It blows me away how good this movie is not just for the acting but for the entire script.

1169,hoisum,the notebook epitomises the term beautiful!,10,4 January 2006,"Everything about The Notebook is beautiful! The actors, the music, the scenery,the story...You go through quite a few emotional states when watching it. I think the strongest part to the movie is the acting, all the actors have feeling and flair and Ryan and Rachel do a good job in portraying this lovely intimacy. It has been a long time since I have found a movie, which makes me want to watch it again and again. Sometimes the characters remind me a bit of Romeo and Juliet...when you really want two people to be together and it is so sweet and so lovely that you feel extra charitable to annoying siblings after watching it... I do recommend anyone to watch The Notebook because it is heart-warming and should not be missed",The Notebook
1170,nicoleex2001,Great one,10,20 April 2006,"I think that is the best love story I've seen in the last years. Is real and touching, makes you think that in life, everything is possible, that faith has an important role in our lives, that love is the most powerful weapon, and can last a life time... I'm glad to see that is a recent movie, because it has been a while since we weren't spoiled with a great love story. Allie and Noah make you turn back in time, when we used to treasure much more devotion, and pure feelings. Even if it is a romantic movie still keeps you in suspense, specially when Allie makes the choice between the two men in her life, her first love, Noah, an impossible love, from her parent's point of view, and the ""perfect"" husband for her, the one she almost got married with. The choice changes her life for good, but with no regrets. Really a great movie. Perfect to see it every time when you doubt that love can be the most beautiful thing in this world...",The Notebook

I watched it on Monday this week, then again on Tuesday and Thursday and I'm ready for one more round tonight. I've never seen a movie like this before. I love old fashioned settings and I really believe that the 50's is such a perfect era for love stories, just because they were so creative back then. From the start where he's on the Ferris Wheel to when they go on the road to the house experience, it's all just so interesting. Makes me quite jealous that I never experienced that era. I thought it was a traditional love story but the plot was much more interesting and not so cliché. Too bad we all don't have a Noah. And it's also great since Ryan and Rachel are both from Ontario!! woo <3 This is better than Garden State... which says a lot!",The Notebook

I find it to be over sentimental rubbish. I find this film is you either love it or you hate it. I for one hated it. If you want a proper romantic film watch stuff like roman holiday, Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain, Le and eternal sunshine. This film was thrown upon me by members of my youth group saying to me 'you should see it. its so sad' well i did see it and i was totally disappointed. Maybe some time in the future my rating of this film will go up but at the moment i find it to be a very bad film that i can't be bothered with.",The Notebook

1175,Madflanker,A film that clearly tugs at heart-strings.,10,20 January 2006,"This movie, in my opinion, is one of the best movies ever produced. It is a movie of such rare quality that it even made me cry, especially when it came to the end, showing the loyalty and essence of true love that we should all pursue in our respective lives. And that message was brought out very clearly, even more so by the chemistry between Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gostling. The casting of such fresh, yet talented faces only served to cleverly tug upon the heart-strings of audiences. However, i believe that more could be done in the film. Perhaps a more detailed depiction of the dilemma affecting Allie, in the fields choosing either an easy pursuit of an affection-filled marriage, or rather, going with her heart in search of a greater love that lies with Noah. Still, the clever linkages back to the heart-rending love that Noah had for Allie when old is nothing short of being exemplary. The climax of the film would have to be the part when Allie finally regains her memory, albeit only for a few minutes. The dedication that a husband should have towards his spouse, and vice-versa, is best demonstrated in this film. Definitely not a chick-flick, but a masterpiece.",The Notebook

Ryan Gosling did a excellent job as Noah (my new heart-throb LOL). I recommend this movie to all!!! This is not a chick flick it is a beautiful story about to star-crossed lovers, i give it a 10/10!!! hope you all enjoy it as much as i did. spoiler: my favorite part was when Noah joined Allie on the ferris wheel and wanted to kill himself if Allie didn't go on a date with him.

1177,ladyvolfan35,Worst adaptation ever,3,3 February 2006,"Wow ... could be the absolute worst adaptation ever. The movie itself, was probably OK, but only if you could get by the fact that the story was totally different. Characters' personalities were changed, essential plot elements were changed ... In fact, it should have been called ""Not the Notebook."" Noah went from a shy, hardworking southern gentleman to I don't know what. He did nothing to ""earn"" Allie's love in this movie. Allie went from a somewhat ignored, sympathetic fiancée to a plain and simple pathetic cheater. Geez, what a disappointment. What about what made the lovers special? Where's that in this movie? The screenplay removed every single piece of motivation possible. And what was up with changing the nature of Noah's relationship with his father, not to mention the father's character entirely? This was one instance they should have left the book alone and written the screenplay from it completely. It didn't need changing, much less ruining.Adaptation? How about remarkably bad re-write instead?",The Notebook

1180,daldwin1,A Great Love Story,10,30 January 2006,"This was one of the greatest love stories that I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Ryan Gosling was, as always, authentic in his portrayal of Noah, a poor working class guy who falls in love with Allie, a beautiful rich girl who is staying in town with her family on their summer's vacation. The relationship is not well received by Allie's parents which leads Noah to make a decision that he feels is in both of their best interests. The result of a hastily made decision leads our main character down a road that first shuts out true passion as he tries to forget his past hurt. But, a stint in the military, where he experiences loss as well as his loss at home following his service in the military, leads him right back to his heart. The story is deep and bittersweet, but ultimately rewarding. It doesn't get any better than this. Wow!",The Notebook

Then for a split second Allie would remember who she was and who Duke was, I cried and smiled.. Then when they meet up again after 7 years it was just so brilliant.. there they are with the love that they thought that they had lost..

She was 81 when she died and before her death, she asked that we take care of my father for her. My father died a year and a half later at the age of 94.

1187,taylordavis-19619,beauty in a movie,10,14 October 2018,"The movie opens up with an elderly woman in a nursing home. along with this woman in a nursing home is an elderly man asking to read to her. Seeing the elderly man and woman first might confuse the viewer because they may wonder what their relevance to the movie. As the movie goes along the man is telling his story from his book. The viewer may get caught up in the movie forgetting the older man is reading the book. The director does not let the viewer get too caught up because he brings the movie back to the older man. The scenes where the older man and woman are not being shown is the beautiful love story between a young rich girl and a young poor boy and how one summer they cross paths at a fair in the small town of New Bern, North Carolina. The two seem to have everything going against them. Whether it is the girl's, (Allie) parents who believe the boy (Noah) is trash and doesn't deserve her or Allie's ambitions and her life ahead of her which was always destined. The two end up breaking up after that one summer but they do not leave each other without the viewer's heart being torn. The movie shows they clearly love each other but obstacles seem to be too big. At one point in the movie, the love story takes a break and we are brought back to the nursing home. the elderly man, Duke, his children come to visit him. the elderly woman ,Allie, is with him and grants permission to meet his kids. The kids introduce themselves and after while Allie leaves. It is then revealed to the viewer that Allie suffers from Alzheimer's and she doesn't remember that the kids standing in front of her are her kids. It is also revealed that Duke is indeed her husband that she also does not remember. This creates a shock and a slight turn in the movie because viewers realize the two broke but somehow the end up together over 60 years later, but how? The movie is brought back to the stories of the love story of Noah and Allie. This brings the close of the scene of the two young lovers and close onto how they found their way back to each other despite the odds. The two lovers find out that when one truly loves the other they always find their way back if they try hard enough. The writers and directors of the movie wants the viewer to want to be Noah and Allie. Girls dreaming of a man who will go through what seems to be a lifetime of mountains to end up with the only girl he could ever truly love. Maybe the also wanted guys to have a girl like Allie who is worth the problems because they could want to love a girl the way Not loved her. The very end of the movie which many people interprets to be sad and will ""rip your heart out"" can be seen as to be sweet because the two lovers are still in love ad they leave the earth together and so their love story die with each other.",The Notebook

I love the way it tied together at the end it was so perfect!!I cry a lot in movies but this one really brought the tears andI what to just say excellent job to the producers and actors and makers of the movie it was fabulous!I recommend this movie to everyone!",The Notebook
1195,xchsxcheerx,The Notebook,10,18 March 2006,"This movie is so amazing. I love it=) Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling are so cute together and they play their characters so well. I definitely suggest you see this movie if you haven't already done so. This movie shows how true love can last even through separation and it's just so cute that they die together. This movie is definitely a tearjerker and it is so well thought out. I can't wait to see more of these two in their upcoming movies. My favorite seen was with the birds though, it was so pretty. Anyone know where this movie took place? I think it was in South Carolina, but I could be wrong. Anyways, I hope you enjoyed the movie or if you haven't seen it yet you go out right now and rent/buy it!",The Notebook
1196,zxc_lurv_devil69,One of the WORST Movies I've Ever Seen!,1,27 March 2006,"It cannot be denied, The Notebook is one of the most successful movies of the modern era. When people list off their favourite movies, The Notebook finds its place somewhere between 1st place and 3rd. My opinion, The Notebook is one of the most boring, corny and overrated movies of all time!When I first saw this movie on DVD, I had a different ending to others where the old people don't die in the end. People say this is the reason why I don't like the movie. I reply with ""So you only like the movie because the two old people die in the end?"" That's like saying that Jack dying at the end of Titanic is greater than the movie itself, which is a load of absolute cr*p. The story is dull and boring and repetitive and takes bits and pieces from all different love stories and throws them together to create 2 hours of a nauseating love story. The two main characters have no chemistry what-so-ever...and for all you people who gasped when you found out that the old couple was actually Noah and Rachel McAdams (can't even remember the characters name it was so boring) .. if you were actually paying attention to the movie you would have realized it was obvious not even halfway into the movie instead of ""awwing"" over the characters like a child going gooey over a fluffy bunny.The fact that this movie has turned into a ""Notebook"" religion is horrible. -I loved it! -Its soo sweet. -Its so sad.When my friend Cait and I switched it on and expected to be sobbing our hearts out by the last act, we were mortified to find that this praised movie was nothing than your usual chick flick that usually just scraps the line of your average telemovie.The movie is a joke. I have to stifle laughter when I see trailers for the movie because it is simply a chick flick with a twist ... a longer duration. Please watch this movie and don't sheep it, sit there and ACTUALLY watch it! Block out the praising and see it for itself ... its nothing special, its not sweet, its not romantic... there is NOTHING memorable about this movie but somewhat everyone seems to go ga-ga over the very title. Notebook schmotebook, if i'm ever made to watch this movie again I will personally place a gun to my head and shoot myself and die with a satisfied smile on my face just as the opening credits start to roll.",The Notebook
1197,sparkling_diamond_88,Amazing film!!,10,28 March 2006,"I absolutely loved The Notebook. It is possibly the best love story I have ever seen!! I think a great film is one that makes you think about it after you have finished watching it, one that you can watch many times and never find boring and one where you wish you were in the film or that your life was like that! And I think The Notebook has all these great features. The chemistry between Noah (Ryan Gosling) and Allie (Rachel McAdams) is amazing. I still find myself crying when it has finished and i've now watched it about ten times!! No other film has yet done that to me! Each scene is done fantastically and when it has finished you just want to start it all over again. If you haven't already watched this film, then believe me you are missing out! Watch it!",The Notebook
