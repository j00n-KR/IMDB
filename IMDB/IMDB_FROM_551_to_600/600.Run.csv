0,SnoopyStyle,nice little film,7,24 November 2020,"Diane Sherman (Sarah Paulson) is an overly protective mother to homeschooled wheelchair-bound teenager Chloe (Kiera Allen). Chloe grows suspicious of the pill her mother gives her.This is a nice little simple psychological horror. The script has a few minor flaws but I can deal with that. The pharmacist is way too stupid. It could have been fixed if she calls social services. That could have led to a tense scene when a social worker comes knocking at the door. Another scene is breaking the window. It's very unlikely to work and she could have just hit it with something like a hammer. When Chloe conveniently discovers everything, it would be more intense if she tries to placate her mother. Newcomer Kiera Allen is actually a pretty good actress and I would like her to try changing gears in her characterization. All in all, this is nice but it could be even better. It needs a bit more mystery. It could be smarter but it's still pretty good.",Run
1,nogodnomasters,I'm not going to hurt you,7,29 November 2020,"Chloe (Kiera Allen) was born with a number of disorders and is lucky to be alive. She is in a wheel chair and is awaiting her college acceptance letter. She is home schooled by her mother. And then PLOT SPOILER Chloe discovers her mother is giving her medication to keep her legs numb. So much for mother-daughter love and trust. Things escalate.Interesting story for just two main characters for much of the feature, of which half is building the characters. Nice twists. I think it has been done before, but it was well done here.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",Run
2,kosmasp,Mommy knows best,8,18 February 2021,"That is something that is mostly true, right? We do accept the wisdom and the experience when it comes to what our moms know and do believe they only have the best interest in their mind. Although obviously that is our best interest - or rather should be.A thriller of this kind can be quite ... flawed and can really drag itself. Not just pacing wise, but character wise, where you may lose patience with what is being done and accepted by some. But having Sarah Paulson in the middle of this, this is quite the stroke of genius casting. I first became aware of her in the show American Gothic (which was unfortunately cut way too early and I have to revisit asap) and have been a fan of her work ever since. Same goes for this one, even if some may disagree overall. Just suspend your disbelief and take this for what it is",Run
3,Sleepin_Dragon,Bad medicine.,8,9 April 2021,"Sara Paulson and Kiera Allen combine beautifully to play mother and daughter in this twisted thriller. A young, disabled girl is convinced that her mother is hiding a dark secret, surely there's a reason why she's shut away from the outside world.After a slow start, it opens up very nicely, it's twisted, and will definitive you vibes if Misery.It is slow to start, but as it develops, it really does gather momentum, and ends with a dramatic climax. You will need to suspend your disbelief, as most of the events are thoroughly non believable, however it is the land of make believe, take it for what it is.I love Sara Paulson, and this is another example of what a fine actress and is. She knows only too well how to play the psycho role incredibly well.Very good, 8/10.",Run
4,lee_eisenberg,you don't even know that you don't know,7,23 December 2020,"There have been quite a few thrillers about people who aren't what they seem, but Aneesh Chaganty's ""Run"" is still enjoyable. Originally planned for a theatrical release, it got postponed due to a certain pandemic, so it aired on Hulu. Sarah Paulson plays a mom who just might have a few skeletons in her closet. There were some clever tricks played throughout the movie, even if they wouldn't have gone exactly as depicted.Not a great movie, but watchable.",Run
5,Tweekums,Does Chloe's mother have her best interests at heart?,8,27 September 2021,"Diane Sherman appears to be a loving mother. She home schools Chloe, her disabled daughter, and is proud of her as she waits to hear from colleges she has applied to. She feeds Chloe only wholesome organic food and makes sure she takes the medicines for her various conditions every day. Then one day Chloe sees that her medication appears to be prescribed to her mother; Diane has an explanation but a seed of doubt has been planted. Chloe determines to find out more about her pills... what she discovered turns her world upside down as she must consider the possibility that her mother is the one making her ill.I found this while looking for a ninety minute horror film on Netflix; I don't think I'd classify it as horror even though it provides the scares it doesn't have most elements one associates with the genre. That said I enjoyed it more than I expected. The setting, and fact that Chloe can't walk, give a really good claustrophobic feel. The fear factor beats that on many horror films as rather than relying on a monster or maniac the potential danger comes from the person our protagonist should trust most... indeed until her accidental discovery she did trust her. Kiera Allen is really great as Chloe and Sarah Paulson impresses as Diane. There are some details that aren't exactly plausible but these can be put down to dramatic license; finding more realistic explanations for certain things would have slowed the film down. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody wanting a good taut thriller but who doesn't demand lots of shooting, explosions and chases.",Run
6,paul_haakonsen,A rather intense and entertaining thriller...,6,7 January 2021,"I hadn't heard about the 2020 ""Run"" from writers Aneesh Chaganty and Sev Ohanian prior to getting to sit down to watch it. I looked it up on IMDb just before watching it, hoping to get an idea what I was in for; so I read the synopsis for the movie, but not any reviews.Normally I am not one to watch an abundance of thrillers, because the genre tends to be pretty much a dime a dozen, but still with the chance given to sit down to watch this particular movie, I did so.And I will say that director Aneesh Chaganty definitely delivered an entertaining movie. The storyline presented in the movie was one that had me thoroughly entertained, and I enjoyed how the writers kept me in the dark, letting me guess as to what was really going on. And director Aneesh Chaganty managed to reveal more and more of the actual happenings in small bits and pieces, which definitely left me wanting for more, and it was such a good sensation when it dawns upon you what is actually happening.""Run"" is a movie that is driven by some great acting performances by the two leads; that being Sarah Paulson (playing Diane, the mom) and Kiera Allen (playing Chloe, the disabled daughter). And since there weren't all that many people in the movie, the pressure of delivering was bigger for the leads, but they mustered this with excellence.The build up of the storyline is good and keeps you wanting more, and I like how the director just gradually feeds you bits and pieces of the storyline, as it makes for a very intense movie.I was definitely entertained by ""Run"" and it is a movie that was well-worth taking the time to sit down and watch. The ending of the movie, though, was just rubbish - pardon my bluntness here. But that ending was just ridiculous; and no, I am not revealing it, as you have to experience it yourself.My rating of ""Run"" lands on a well-deserved six out of ten stars.",Run
7,deloudelouvain,"Suspenseful, glad I didn't pay attention to the complaining negative reviews.",8,26 November 2020,"Once again I come to the conclusion I can't trust the negative reviews on here as after watching Run I just think the opposite of those reviews. I wanted to watch an engaging mysterious thriller story and that's exactly what I got, so no I won't complain about Run. There is a constant high suspense what keeps you very focussed on the movie. Sarah Paulson and Kiera Allen both did a great job playing their characters. Run is one of those movies I wished they made more of, one with a good entertaining story, a nice pace so you never get bored, a good soundtrack and more than capable actors. Perfect movie for a nice cinema evening!",Run
8,FeastMode,"slow start, intense finish",6,1 August 2021,"It takes a while to get going. But when it does, you can't look away. I had a good time with this movie. (1 viewing, 7/31/2021)",Run
9,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Motherly misery.,7,5 April 2021,"'Run (2020)' is centred on a wheelchair-bound teenager who, on the cusp of going to college, begins to suspect that her mother is hiding a sinister secret. For much of its runtime, it plays out as a sort of low-key (or, perhaps, 'realistic') mystery focused primarily on its lead character's increasingly cunning means of uncovering the truth. After a certain point, though, it dips into much more generic territory and takes the form of a much more formulaic thriller. After this point, the motivation of a certain character slips from 'almost understandable' to 'downright insane' and it loses almost all sense of nuance and, even, realism. Basically, there's a definitive villain who - despite having suffered trauma and clearly being in need of psychological help - doesn't feel like they can ever be redeemed. Naturally, this is a lot less interesting than what the film initially sets up. However, the picture manages to move past its mistakes because it's constantly exploring new angles of its generic events. A large part of that is thanks to the fact that it focuses on a disabled character (portrayed by a real wheelchair user), a perspective not often seen in cinema of any kind. She's smart, capable and resourceful; it's incredibly satisfying to see her overcome the increasingly difficult obstacles in her path. The flick is suspenseful and tense when it needs to be, taking cues from films such as 'Misery (1990)' to keep its audience right where it wants them to be. It's really entertaining, actually. It just trips over itself every now and again. It's ultimately rather generic in a lot of ways, which is a tad frustrating since it's so distinct and progressive in others. Still, it's a strong entry in its genre. It might not reinvent the wheel, but at least it shows it from another angle. 7/10.",Run
10,Edvis-1997,7,7,20 January 2021,"It was decent movie. This one was more like action/intense film more than horror (because I didn't see anything disturbing,scary just a tiny amount of blood). 90 minutes of movie gone really fast, didn't have to go for a break or make pause. Acting was good, maybe sometimes girl's acting wasn't perfect but she's young and there's time to learn(even from Sarah Paulson,amazing actress). Main idea wasn't unique, you can literally say ""I've seen that somewhere"" but movie wasn't bad. I would recommend to watch it for action fans and it's strong 7 from me.",Run

12,nairtejas,A Terrific Sarah Paulson and Kiera Allen,8,10 May 2021,"I watched a lot of movies and it had been a long time (over the pandemic year/s) since I have seen such a gripping thriller involving a family. In Run, a mother and a daughter's relationship starts to strain when the latter suspects her mother is doing ill on her. As you continue to guess what it might be, Run takes you by surprise. It delivers the goods and it keeps you hooked till the last second. Go, watch it already!",Run
13,paulclaassen,Suspenseful and creepy on a different level.,6,21 January 2021,"'Run' is a well crafted, tense thriller that hits you with shocking twist upon shocking twist.What happens when you suddenly don't trust your mom anymore, after she has lovingly taken care of you for 17 years? 'Run' explores this - with nail-biting suspense! This was creepy on a completely different level. The film's protagonist is Chloe, a paraplegic (excellently portrayed by real-life wheelchair bound actress Kiera Allen). Whenever a thriller features a character with a disability (or pregnant woman) the suspense is automatically elevated. 'Run' became more intense and suspenseful with every scene.Once the characters are set up, it doesn't take long before events take a turn for the worse, and Chloe realizes she's a prisoner within the confines of her own home. I don't want to do any spoilers, so I'm not going to delve too deep into the story. This is one of those movies where the ending couldn't come soon enough. Not because I didn't like it, but because it was so nerve wrecking that I could hardly contain my curiosity to see how it would end. Amazingly, the film simply never loses momentum. This is a rather disturbing psychological thriller, and one of the must-see films of 2020 (if you're into thrillers).Kiera Allan brilliantly carries the film, and Sarah Paulsen is superb as the mother, Diane. I thought 'Run' was excellent.Would I watch it again? Yes.",Run
14,Thanos_Alfie,The secret...,6,10 December 2020,"""Run"" is a Mystery - Horror movie in which we watch the lives of a mother and her daughter who is home-schooled. The daughter starts to suspect her mother after finding out some evidence that she is lying to her. She will try to find out the truth but her mother does not want her to.I liked this movie because it had a simple but interesting plot, much of suspense in many scenes and very good interpretations by the cast. The direction which was made by Aneesh Chaganty, it was very good and I believe that he did an excellent job on made the audience feel what his main character being through and created a feeling that the audience is a part of the movie. Regarding the interpretations, both Sarah Paulson who played as Diane Sherman and Kiera Allen who played as Chloe Sherman were very good. Lastly, I have to say that I strongly recommend this movie to any horror movie fan because I am sure that you will enjoy it.",Run
15,cruise01,Effective thriller that will keep you anxious and on edge.,8,4 December 2020,4 out of 5 stars.Run is a good thriller film about a mother Diane (Sarah Paulson) after prematurely giving birth. Her baby is born with several illnesses and disorders that will cause her to always need help and be medicated. As a teen Chloe (Kiera Allen) is homeschooled by her mother. While anxiously waiting to hear back from an university on her application. She soon discover that one of her medication may not be her own. Which causes her to dig up more information if her mother is really helping her or her mother is hiding something.Run is a effective thriller. Putting the audience on the edge with a poor helpless girl. Which she is unable to walk. Her mother sheltering her away with no computer besides her own. No cell phones. So Chloe is unable to really reach for outside help besides her mother. The direction did a good job in leaving you on the edge of your seat. Chloe trying to seek help while her mother is distracted with something. But moments later her mother is creepily lurking near.The plot may be covering similar concept grounds that lifetime movies have done before. But thrilling nonetheless. There is a twist that may shock viewers.Sarah Paulson plays a creepy obsessed mother really well. Kiera Allen also did a good job in playing a struggling daughter.The film does pick up the pace with thrills and suspense which may have you gasping for air when Chloe is trying to seek help away from her mother. Definitely a thriller worth checking out.,Run
16,eddie_baggins,A mid-tier thriller with some unique elements,5,12 April 2021,"Following the surprise success of his first feature film, the internet based Searching, up and coming director Aneesh Chaganty returns to the thriller genre for his second feature effort Run, a Sarah Paulson starring event picture that recently set Hulu streaming records in the United States when it premiered on the service in late November of 2020.A familiar film in many ways that is made to appear fresher thanks to its casting of wheelchair using actress Kiera Allen, who stars as the films main protagonist Chloe Sherman, Run isn't as inventive or effective as Chaganty's first effort behind the camera but it once more showcases a director looking at doing things differently in a landscape where the easy option is often taken.Unable to provide much in the way of shock or unforeseen twists and feelings that at times the story at the heart of the tale is leaning too far into the unbelievable, Run see's poor old Chloe discovering that her seemingly loving mother may in fact not be the parental caregiver that she had thought she was as Sarah Paulson's wide-eyed Diane starts displaying cracks in her outward façade and in her motivations.Paulson is effective as usual as Diane, even if she is prone to over play some moments in the film (yelling at some poor pharmacy customers, Paulson finds herself in one of the years more unintentionally hilarious scenes) while Allen delivers a career making turn as Chloe who is absolutely someone we as an audience want to see succeed as we go along her journey with her, one that will make her question her entire life and diagnosis up until this point in time.Working best in its quieter moments, especially in its early scenes that have an ominous and foreboding sense of dread and despair about them, it's a shame Run starts too lose steam in its latter section as a feeling as though a majority of its best moments have already come to fruition and the film is merely playing out a set of more predictable moments that will surprise no one who has ever seen a film of this ilk before.Final Say -A solid if unspectacular sophomore effort from Chaganty that can't hide its generic center behind the inventive casting and lead character development, Run ends up being totally watchable but far from memorable.2 1/2 glasses of wine out of 5.",Run
17,damianphelps,Walks The Tightrope,8,7 August 2021,"This film is pretty predictable and then it isn't. Just when it looks like it's going to follow the clichés it makes a small tweak to change things up.It works perfectly.Paulson is epic in this, keep an eye out for her just sitting in the kitchen, it's my favourite scene in the movie.I really recommend this one even for Paulson alone, but it's more than that :)",Run
18,marmar-69780,Run,8,21 November 2020,Run was a well acted thriller that had some very good psychological chills in it that were able to impress me in a sort of a way.Before watching this film i thought i will witness another cliched horror film with psychological drama that i saw a million times before but i was actually surprised by this film in a good way.Actresses give a very good job expecely Sarah Paulson who was very creeepy in some scenes and in end she did a god job.Kiera Allen is a actress that i dont know much about but she also did a good job.Run was a nice surprise for me and i was happy with it,Run

21,jtindahouse,Excellently made but we've seen this story too many times before,7,21 November 2020,"I was a big fan of Aneesh Chaganty's debut film 'Searching'. It was creative, original and best of all it was a gripping and clever story. It was one of my few perfect 10 scores for 2018. So needless to say I was very excited for his follow-up film 'Run'. I really wanted to love this film, but I just couldn't. I enjoyed it, no doubt about that, but it never managed to grip me and put me on the edge of my seat needing to know what was going to happen next.The story was just a little bit basic for me. It felt like the kind of plot you'd find in a Lifetime movie. It was just simply made with much more class behind the camera and far better actors than those films typically get. The film does have a PG-13 rating which is usually a red flag of a very safe movie, however 'Searching' had the same rating so I wasn't too worried about that. 'Run' did feel extremely safe though. Any minor scenes of violence that do occur typically happen off screen for the most part. The pacing in this film also seemed just a little off. There are some very over-long and drawn out scenes with not a lot going on.The acting in this film is superb. Sarah Paulson gives her everything to the role. She's almost worth an entire extra point for the film all by herself. Also new-comer Kiera Allen in her debut film blew me away. I would never have guessed that she was new to the industry. There's some good stuff in 'Run' and it is made exceptionally well for the most part. I just feel the plot has been done far too many times before and for that reason in particular this film will be gone from my mind a week from now.",Run
22,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Run.,8,30 November 2020,"8/10 - with tremendous performances from Sarah Paulson and Kiera Allen, this horror-thriller proves Aneesh Chaganty (and the rest of his team responsible for this and 2018's Searching) is a new great of the genre",Run
23,alindsay-al,A Good Suspense Thriller,7,2 April 2021,"There are so many new films coming out this weekend and I hope that I can get them all in and I have decided to start with Netflix's new film Run and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a home-schooled student begin to suspect something isn't right with her mother and their living situation.Main Character
Sarah Poulson plays the mother in this film and she is really good. You can tell early on that something isn't quite right about her and Poulson manages to convey that without going over the top and making it a cheesy performance. It is a character where you shouldn't know anything about her going into the film as the mystery about what she is exactly up to is probably the best part of the film.Supporting Characters
Kiera Allen plays her daughter and I checked this is her first ever film and when you consider that she is remarkably good in the role. She is also confined to a wheelchair in real life, which I think adds way more impact to her performance. Her character is an easy one to root for and you really want her to work out what exactly is going and manage to have a happy ending. There isn't really any other characters in this film but some of the characters that have the odd scenes were really bad and took me out of the experience. I get that they hire unknown actors for these roles but maybe make sure they can deliver a realistic and normal scene.Story
The story is interesting, it kept me on edge throughout as you feel like you are similar to Allen's character as we really aren't sure what is exactly going on. Also there is a twist in the film as you would expect and I think it added plenty to the film and caught me off guard in a good way that it rose the quality of the product. But this films last act kind of lost me, its where the film starts to embrace the absurdity of everything and play it up but it is just too much and I think it is easily the least interesting part of the film.Script
The script is decent, the dramatic moments are well realised by the two actresses as they really build this dynamic that is interesting. But there is a lack of any humour and when you actually think it through, there is clear gaps in logic and things just don't always make sense.Style
The style of the film is really strong, the way it is directed and shot adds intrigue and suspense that a thriller truly needs. The pacing is really good with the film keeping me interested throughout and with it hitting 90 mins it doesn't overstay its welcome which is more then can be said for some films in the same genre.Overall
Overall, Run might be one of the biggest surprises so far in 2021. This is a good film that is suspenseful and intriguing, its not the best film ever but if you have Netflix and have 90 minutes you can do much worse then watching Run.",Run

26,yusufpiskin,Hulu & Sarah Paulson,6,22 November 2020,"A solid but predictable thriller. A little disappointing as a follow up to Searching. Great debut from Kiera Allen.Director Aneesh Chaganty and co-writer Sev Ohanian struck gold with 2018's Searching. It's creative, original and gripping story hooked me from beginning to end. So it should go without saying that my level of excitement for their follow-up film Run would be quite high. I really wanted to love this film, but unfortunately it never quite reached the heights of joy I felt watching their debut effort.The story was just too paint-by-numbers to me. Run felt like the kind of plot you'd find in a typical cable movie. Despite this, Sarah Paulson and Kiera Allen's performances were fantastic. Perhaps if the script had given us a bit more backstory to these characters, I would've felt more invested in the drama that enfolds between the 2nd and 3rd act.It's not to say that Run doesn't have some shining moments here and there. It's filmed exceptionally well for the most part and the scene at the pharmacy was well acted and intense. And while the execution of the final scene may have fallen short, I do appreciate the turnabout dynamic between mother and daughter.",Run
27,Pairic,Psychological Horror,7,25 November 2020,"Run: Some mothers will do anything to keep control over their daughters. In this case it even extends to giving the daughter animal muscle relaxants to keep her in a wheelchair. This is is more than just another tale of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy though; far darker secrets are revealed as the narrative unfolds. Most of the horror here is psychological but there are some violent scenes. There is also the sense of betrayal as the daughter, Chloe (Kiera Allen), begins to comprehend the enormity of the transgressions inflicted on her by her mother (Sarah Paulson). Good acting by Allen and Paulson in this horror/thriller which is Written and Directed by Aneesh Chaganty. 7/10.",Run

29,jfgibson73,Well written thriller,7,23 February 2021,"This was a very tightly constructed story that makes sense most of the time. There was at least one questionable choice made just to move the plot along. There were two main performers, a mother and a daughter, and a mystery slowly unravels.

31,I_Ailurophile,"Outstanding, defiant thriller",10,5 May 2021,"To an extent, we've seen similar movies before. Within the first few minutes and the first couple scenes we can begin to guess the general narrative thrust - but we still get surprises in the details of how it plays out. Defying basic familiarity, 'Run' greatly succeeds in being fun, thrilling, and unsettling.The building suspense is intense, with each turn in the plot making us feel ever more uneasy. Even though we can see generally where it's headed, that doesn't dampen the growing anxiety we share with protagonist Chloe. It helps that the film is set almost entirely within the home this mother and daughter share, confines that aid the troubling air about it all. Where the setting shifts outside the home, it's for a very specific narrative purpose; there is no excess or needless indulgence here, only thrills. And to that point - the turn in the plot within the last 20-30 minutes, heading toward the climax, ramps up the thrills considerably, and it's absolutely entrancing.Throughout the length, no small detail is left unnoticed as a means to craft the story being told. This is true as much for those oddities Chloe discovers that raises her suspicion of her mother, Diane, as for the early focus on all the small minutiae of their daily life together. The screenplay is immersive, and all credit in the world to writer-director Aneesh Chaganty and writer/co-producer Sev Ohanian - 'Run' is captivating.Maybe I'm just imagining things, or projecting, but throughout the picture there's seemingly a hint of shadow that pervades the lighting. This lends a great deal to the frankly hair-raising atmosphere - as does the original score by Torin Borrowdale. The music complements the developing tension so well, and is still another noteworthy aspect of the feature.Above all, though, 'Run' is primarily a vehicle for its two stars, and therein lies its greatest success of all. Sarah Paulson has some noteworthy credits to her name, but her performance here as doting mother Diane is truly stellar. Even when not demonstrating alarming behavior or having an outburst of emotion, there is an unyielding intensity she gives the role that makes the twisted nature of the scenario all the more riveting. If I haven't looked for Paulson's name before, I surely will now.Yet even Sarah Paulson's marvelous performance is outshone by Kiera Allen, making her full-length film debut as afflicted protagonist Chloe. Allen is absolutely outstanding, making Chloe relatable, sympathetic, and as believably lifelike as a fictional character could be. I truly hope to see Allen in many more pictures in the future, because this is a powerhouse display of acting skill that deserves so much attention, accolade, and reward. She excellently portrays every frustration, anxiety, fear, panic, and resolve of the character, even with the limitations that the screenplay increasingly gives Chloe as the film progresses toward its conclusion. She should be so very proud of 'Run,' because she has impressed me in a way where I can't immediately draw any comparison.While one doesn't wish to linger on such things, it is necessary to mention so long as the film industry in general flags with little to no progress: There is a long-standing, appalling tendency in Hollywood and elsewhere toward casting that ignores performers fitting the demographic of a given role. One would think the lesson had been learned after blackface was relegated to shameful cinematic history, yet still diversity is lacking. Trans roles too often go to cis actors, gay roles to straight actors, or disabled roles to actors with no disability at all. It is to the credit of the filmmakers in this instance that they bucked this trend, and ever more so because in casting Kiera Allen as Chloe, they have exposed audiences to an astounding young actress. Hopefully, in so doing, they have opened her future to many, many more roles - to say nothing of the future of many other actors as well.To be honest, in the first few minutes after I began watching, I was a little bit skeptical. That the rudimentary gist of the plot seemed familiar had me second-guessing the viewing, and I lowered my expectations. But I am blown away: despite sharing a measure of kinship with other stories we've seen before, 'Run' stands so strongly of its own merit that I think it should be heralded as an exemplar.I don't generally give a feature a ""perfect score"" unless there's something about it that truly leaps out at me. Save perhaps for Paulson and Allen's performances, I don't know that there's a particular outlier here. Yet 'Run' is just so carefully, lovingly crafted as a whole, such a great film of its own accord, that I think it absolutely stands alongside the best of the best.Don't pass this up. Highest recommendation!",Run
32,valleyjohn,Utterly Ridiculous,5,9 October 2021,"This is the story of a homeschooled teenager who is in a wheelchair and she begins to suspect her mother is keeping a dark secret from her.I can't remember how long it is since I watched a film as ridiculous as this .I'm not saying it isn't entertaining in parts but if films won awards for ridiculousness this would be a favourite to win .There is one scene where Chloe climbs over the roof of her house , bearing in mind she's disabled, to the outside of her mothers bedroom . She then gets what must be the hottest ever tiny little soldering iron and touches it on the window and it cracks from the heat ! She then sprays it with water she's been carrying in her mouth all the time , and it shatters !!Whoever thought up that scene had a wild imagination but should never write movie scripts ever again!The whole film is full of set pieces like that and I suppose if you don't think deeply about it you might enjoy it .I liked the performance of Sarah Paulson. She really does have that kind of face that lends herself to weird characters and Kiera Allen who is actually in a wheelchair in real life , is ok too but this won't be a film that stays with me for too long .",Run

35,arungeorge13,A mediocre thriller featuring a solid lead performance from Kiera Allen! [+52%],5,21 November 2020,"Aneesh Chaganty's second directorial effort is several notches below his first ('Searching'). All of the mystery and thrills get exhausted in the first 35 minutes and thereafter, it's a straightforward, predictably mediocre film. It's almost like the writers (Changanty himself & Sev Ohanian) ran out of ideas in the second half and what ends up on the screen is plot-holes galore. I mean, I simply cannot like a thriller where the antagonist stocks all evidence of her wrongdoings in a goddamn box for the protagonist to conveniently find them at a crucial juncture in the film. That's just ridiculous!The good thing to have come out of the weirdly titled 'Run' is Kiera Allen. She puts up a more-than-decent performance that keeps the first act and parts of the second mostly engaging. Sarah Paulson is fine as the creepy, protective mom but I wish her character had better detailing (those scars were such a useless decoy!) . The film seems to have been designed to evoke the feels of reading a Stephen King novel (noticed the Kathy Bates Easter egg) or watching one of M.N Shyamalan's earlier thrillers. In fact, some wide-angle shots are effectively chilling. The quest to unravel the mystery is, though predictable, fairly more exciting in the initial bits.On the whole, I felt that Run was a rather hollow effort in creating an emotional thriller that places the subject of abusive parenting at its forefront. It does offer a few big acting moments for Kiera Allen (who's a wheelchair-user in real life) but forgets to flesh out Paulson's character. 'Run' isn't a solid follow-up to 'Searching', but I'll still keep an eye out for Chaganty's next.",Run
36,rivertam26,Intense,8,22 November 2020,"Originally intended for release in theaters this smart, intense thriller was sold to hulu and premiered Friday. The brilliant Sarah Paulson (American Horror Story) stars as the mother of a supposedly sick child that she's spent 17 years taking care of her. The young woman Chloe, played by solid newcomer Kiera Allen begins to suspect her mother may be the one keeping her sick. The movie is intense and edge of your seat filled with clever twists and turns. Although the material is familiar its executed creatively by Aneesh Chaganty of the criminally underseen Searching. This would have been great in theaters but is still damn good at home.****/5

41,hnt_dnl,Nifty old-fashioned suspense thriller,9,24 November 2020,"RUN (2020) was surprisingly better than I thought. I think it was originally meant to premiere in theaters until the COVID pandemic hit and delayed it among many major Hollywood productions. So it ended up on Hulu as one of their ""original"" movies. I'm still not 100% sure about how I feel on Sarah Paulson. While I generally think she's an actress who is very good at relaying deep emotions, there's also something annoying about her acting style as she has this languorous speech pattern like she's trying to hypnotize the person she's talking to. She's also famous for her nonstop crying and screaming. Anyone who has seen American Horror Story knows what I'm talking about. So, why, you ask, if I'm not the biggest Sarah Paulson fan (as so many people seem to be) am I rating this flick so highly? First, this is a very well done movie. Second, Paulson's hystrionics are dialed down immensely in this to the point I actually like her performance. Finally, Paulson is not the actual star of this piece. That honor goes to newcomer Kiera Allen in a brilliant film debut. It is Allen's character that really drives the plot.Run is the story of single mother Diane Sherman (Paulson) and her 17-year old daughter Chloe Sherman (Allen). Chloe was born with several debilitating birth defects, including paralysis, asthma, and diabetes. Diane has dedicated her life to care for Chloe, including home schooling, a strict dietary regimen, and supervising her medical care. A wheelchair-confined Chloe is pretty good at taking care of herself and is incredibly smart. Allen, who is actually disabled in real life, is a revelation as she is required to do many hair-raising physical stunts while still staying in character. And in actuality, Allen gets way more screen time than Paulson as the film is told almost completely from Chloe's POV. In particular, I like how incredibly smart and clever that Chloe is. Every move that makes feels like it's coming from a character with actual common sense. In fact, Chloe may be one of the smartest protagonists that I've ever seen in a horror movie. Plus, for once, the minor characters aren't dumb as a bag of rocks as they usually are in horror films.The first half of the film cleverly makes you wonder if there's really something off with Diane or is it all just in Chloe's mind. The second half pays it all off. It has an old-fashioned horror movie appeal with a very simple plot and believable characters. No tricks or silly special effects. Just a straightforward plot that allows the viewer to go along with Chloe on her journey of self-discovery as well as finding out the deal with her mother. Also, the ending is incredibly satisfying.",Run

45,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,If Hitchcock made comedies ...,7,31 December 2020,"There isn't any doubt in my mind that Sarah Paulson is a phenomenal actress. She really does horror and thrillers really well. Kiera Allen was pretty good in this film too. I liked the Hitchcock atmospheric feel and pacing to this film. Great cinematography and the sound just felt like an older Hitchcock film but with modern high quality visuals.But I just had so many giggles watching this film that it felt more like a dark comedy. Perhaps that was the intention and if that is the case, I owe it a higher score. But I got a kick out of all of the obstacle and barriers that are thrown in front of Kiera Allen's character; its timing consistency had almost a rhythmic feel to it with the background music. It was humorous. The film becomes painfully predictable when we get to the leg end of the film inside the hospital.I really wish the American studios would allow directors to make films that don't always have happy endings. One of the reasons why I like foreign films so much is that they don't always end with happen endings. The finality of not having the white hats come in the nick of time to save the protagonist drives in the moral or theme of the story to the viewer. When you don't have to have a happy ending, the writers have much more freedom to write better stories.Personally, I would have ended the story with the camera pulling away from Kiera Allen on the bed into a Birdseye view from the ceiling revealing her legs amputated. The irony of what was done with pills and become a physical permanent disability. But I am no Nancy, I love dark twisted horror so c'est la vie.I'll give it a 7 because it does have a high quality feel to it and good acting, even though the writer just made it laughable at the end.P.S. Kiera Allen character dragging her body over the roof tops with a mouth full of liquid was hysterical.",Run

Run solidifies Chaganty's place in Hollywood as one of the most technically impressive directors working today. His undeniable talent allows him to effortlessly generate incredible suspense throughout the movie's entire runtime, and his second feature-film is no exception.Possessing the type of premise I enjoy the most in thrillers, Chaganty and Sev Ohanian's screenplay is packed with excruciatingly long takes, filled with extremely tense dialogues, shocking developments, and a brutal amount of pain. All are enormously elevated by one of the most physically-demanding, emotionally powerful performances I've seen in the last few years: Kiera Allen, who uses a wheelchair for mobility in real-life, turns her acting debut into a genuine, realistic display of the challenging obstacles people with her condition have to overcome daily.Sarah Paulson continues her trend of playing truly evil characters, and I advise her to keep following this dark path of phenomenal interpretations. Her interactions with Kiera are remarkably intense. Story-wise, even though the constant revelations are narratively shocking, most of the script's developments are somewhat predictable. However, the ""movie logic"" problems stretch believability to a point beyond my limit, ultimately becoming one of those films people will either deeply enjoy or really hate depending on how nitpicky they choose to be.I'm as moderate as I can be, and the truth is, I didn't really think about these logical issues during the actual viewing. Having in mind Run's brilliant technical attributes (notably Nick Johnson and Will Merrick's editing, and Torin Borrowdale's score), its two impressive lead performances, and its endless suspenseful atmosphere, I can't help but recommend it to every fan of the genre.Rating: B+",Run
53,SoumikBanerjee25,Needed Further Rationale!,6,14 July 2021,"This is more of an unfeigned textbook approach to a Dramatic Thriller than an experimental one. A meandering tale of a Mother's overbearing love that is endowed with preponderant emotions and thought-provoking contemplations. Needless to say, it does deliver on the key aspects of Fear, Anxiety, and Incertitude.However, things go awry when it boils down to character purposes and pretexts. Without going into Spoiler territory; I just wanna say, the plot points we got were in dire need of further clarifications. The final act blatantly puts forward more queries than answers and I despise it when that happens.Looking at all the possibilities such an intriguing concept might have offered, I am saddened to see the creators choosing a safe passage over an ambitious one. They had all the fundamental constituents to achieve a rather desired outcome. Be it the formidable performances from Sarah Paulson, Kiera Allen, or the self-evident technological prowess; quite frankly, they had everything to go that extra mile. Yet they have chosen not to!Now, don't get me wrong. This is still a well-made movie with an ample amount of positive things to take away.

I do however really like the acting and the story itself is excellent as well. It's also really refreshing to see them use an disabled actor for a role instead of a non-disabled actor simply acting disabled... it's something that Directors should do much, much more often. I liked the pacing of the film, the suspense, as well as the plot twists (although I managed to predict 2 of the plot twists, so it's not like the film's plot twists are amazing or anything like that).

58,ronakkotian,A standard thriller that does work,6,11 April 2021,"Aneesh Chaganty made a dazzling debut with Searching, a film which I really like. His sophomore effort, Run, is engaging but not as good.Run follows Chloe, a homeschooled and wheelchair-bound teenager who suspects her mother is harbouring a dark secret from her.Most films that I've seen take place over a computer screen did not utilise the medium to its full potential which is why Searching stood out to me. With Run, Chaganty goes for a more standard and simple thriller. Despite how restricted the film is in terms of scale, Chaganty makes use of the small scale to great effect. There are some great moments of tension executed well and a level of claustrophobia that emerges as a result of the confined area the film takes place in. Casting Kiera Allen, an actual wheelchair user, was a great choice. Scenes with her crawling on the floor were effective as the struggle was real which made it suspenseful. Her performance was also great especially considering this was her feature film debut. Sarah Paulson seems to love playing horrible people but I can't complain because she does such a good job playing them.My main problem with Run is how standard of a thriller it is. After it ended, the film didn't leave much of an impression on me since there wasn't really anything in particular that made this film special. It was a fun 90 minute film that was well made but aside from that, I don't see myself remembering it in the long run or wanting to revisit it.

Sarah Paulson seems to be prominent & in a lot of TV series & movies of late. I do not know if that is a good or bad thing. This cat and mouse game between ""mother"" and daughter is intriguing but very predictable. Sarah does her best impression of Jack Nicholson in the Shining or Kathy Bates in Misery. Imitations are rarely as good as the original and this proves to ring true here.I found it illogical that the mother has readily access to needles & syringes & medication galore prescribed for a fictitious animal without the pharmacist first checking. This can only occur in films. The finale twist is equally baffling... Hospital security is not that easy to by pass...

Run certainly doesn't come close to the lofty heights of Searching, one of my top 5 movies of 2018, but it delivers a satisfying, tense thriller in a short runtime. The plot is quite straightforward and is predictable, but the performances and direction keep us on the edge of our seat anyways. The basic story is pretty one-note and I'm not even sure if the advertising is trying to hide it. Even so, as you'd expect if you watched Searching, the attention to detail is excellent here. The set design is great, with small details throughout the house adding to the immersion. Paulson has a fun role that she thankfully doesn't go too off the rails with, but it is absolutely Allen who steals the show here. It was a great choice to get an actress who actually uses a wheelchair for the role, because the movements, especially quick ones when she's trying to get going quickly or be sneaky, would fall flat on their face if she wasn't deft in using the wheelchair. Not only are the wheelchair scenes completely natural, Allen's gradual turn from nervous bargaining to intense fear is fantastic. I really hope we see more from her in the future, because she'd honestly make my top 5 lead actresses of this year right now. The script isn't quite as tight as in Searching, and the final scene (with the line ""open wide"") was quite silly and detracts from the resolution up to that point.

""You will.""A homeschooled teenager confined to a wheelchair due to many medical issues begins to suspect her mother is keeping a dark secret from her. This by itself is an interesting enough plot for potential. Then add Aneesh Chaganty and it's bound to be a success. Run is probably more popular than Searching already from the record breaking views on Hulu. All of us Searching fans have been waiting for this one for a while now. I'm sad to say Run doesn't quite hold up to the standards of Searching, but this is still a good movie. Sev Ohanian and Aneesh Chaganty know how to make a compelling story. Every step of the way I wanted to know what would happen next. How Searching filled itself up with mystery and twists till the end overpowers this one. Run's setup is not like that in which you know what is going to happen, but how it will unfold is the mystery. That's where it suffered for me. Just the expectations I had from the writers, directors, and raving reviews before its release had me with such high hopes. In the end I got a good movie, though.The performances is where the story shines most. Sarah Paulson has been the center of attention for this one because of American Horror Story and how well she does with horrors/thrillers. She is convincing, but because of the writing you know what's going to happen with her and everything. For her first feature, Kiera Allen does fantastic. We're with her mainly the whole time so we can really connect with her. Portraying all these health issues can be challenging for an actor. She makes it look almost easy with how well she did. I'm sure come Chainsaw Awards and all those, she'll be in conversation. I don't have much else to say about Run. It's good but didn't wow me. As a thriller, this is very entertaining and a good watch. The reviews might be a little generous but that's not to say this doesn't represent good filmmaking.",Run

Yet, the whole movie's atmosphere is dreary, and Diane's psychopathic behavior (aka Sarah Paulson doing what she does so well) makes 'Run' horror-enough.",Run

72,Mike_Devine,A straightforward psychological thriller,6,2 January 2021,"In the age of streaming, we've become accustomed to watching a fair share of uncomfortable thrillers that we otherwise wouldn't be exposed to. While most of these are straight up trash, a few are worth writing home about. 'Run' is one example.Starring the modern-day scream queen herself, 'Run' does a good job of diving deep down into the emotional profiles of a caretaker mother and her ill daughter. Character-driven thrillers such as this one must ride or die on the abilities of its actors, and Sarah Paulson lives up to her reputation as the strict mother who apparently devotes her life to caring for her daughter (played by Kiera Allen). Allen's portrayal of the confused Chloe is also admirable, and the two together are a formidable pair.Perhaps one of the best qualities of 'Run' is its limited range. It doesn't try to take a 180 degree turn, and even if there's a twist that can be seen coming from a backroad mile away, it doesn't feel offensive as these twists often can in low budget psychological thrillers. And while there are a few ""are you serious?"" scenes here and there, they aren't sold as being super serious.It's by no means a masterpiece, nor is it uplifting, but 'Run' is pretty entertaining at face value.",Run

In this, you are asked to believe that a baby can be whisked away from a Maternity Ward.Have any of those involved with the production of this ever been to a Maternity/NICU ward in the USA within the last 35 years? Not likely.They are all - without exception - a locked unit. Often, you need to be badged in and sign in with ID...and the ones in my area (DC), you are wrist-banded. Also, the baby is banded with a chip and that chip will set off alarms if removed from the area.You are never alone - you are not allowed access to the babies unsupervised...and there are cameras and security everywhere.The idea of waltzing out of one with a newborn is ridiculous & if you did manage it, you'd be apprehended immediately. It's preposterous...but there you.Also, if you're a psychopath who intends to imprison your daughter forever, why would you bother to mail the college applications in the first place? I'll tell you, so at one point the kid can find one.At one point, the kid sneaks out of her bedroom window, drags herself over the shingles to her mom's room, all the while lugging along extension cords, a soldering iron, and a mouth full of water...she plugs it in and BINGO - it's all warmed up (they take minutes)...she heats the glass and spits the water shattering the glass...makes sense since she has a room full of tools and could have broken the glass in a much easier way. All this to show how ingenious she is. Then the geniuses behind this mess gave her the most cliched medical issue - the inhaler trope. Of course, she starts having breathing problems...and of course, she reaches her inhaler just in time. Whew! For a minute there, I didn't think she was gonna make it.

Director: Aneesh Chaganty
Starring: Sarah Paulson and Kiera Allen
Overall rating 93/100Run is about a disabled home-schooled girl called Chloe (Kiera Allen) who is waiting to get results to get into her college, but when she gets nothing she begins to suspect her overprotective mother is keeping a dark secret from her. What an intense film Run was, I was on edge from beginning to end, so let's get started.Firstly, I thought the movie itself was a really interesting idea, I think it had a great set up and character background, as well as having great sound design and cinematography. The movie's premise itself was really interesting and had me hooked straight away, it set up the mystery straight away with the mother and was an effective psychological thriller premise with the family dynamic. I also found the set up really interesting, the movie did an excellent job at suspending the audiences disbelief in terms of setting up normality between the mother and daughter relationship and making you believe that there was nothing wrong happening this just added to the tension that was slowly built up. I also really appreciated the character background and set up for both Sarah Paulson and Kiera Allen's character, we understood the mothers troubled past and near death experience with her child and the connection she had to her daughter, but we also got a good establishment of both of their routines together and how Chloe deals with her disabilities which I loved. I also thought that the sound design for this movie was excellent, it was intensified and loud when it needed to be to keep you on edge and was used very effectively. I also really loved the cinematography involved, due to the movie mostly being limited to roughly one set location they used every aspect of the house very well and had multiple very creative shots, especially with the mother in the background of the frame in order to build tension so they still managed to make it seem fresh and creative whilst still mostly only being in one location which was great.My next few positives would be the tense tone and building of tension, fantastic performances, the positive representation of disability, as well as the strong script. The movie managed to achieve an excellent tense tone, the events and the correlation with the mother got more and more uncomfortable and tense and I loved it, the movie took its time and built the tension effectively over time. The performances were also fantastic, both Kiera Allen and Sarah Paulson did a fantastic job here, Sarah plays darker roles excellently, her performance was uncomfortable, powerful and she really bought the character to life, Kiera Allen was also fantastic, she got so into the role she managed to create a big reaction from me in terms of really sympathising with her character which proves that her performance was powerful and believable. I also thought the movie had very positive representation for disability, they showed effectively how Chloe didn't let her disability from stopping her and she still had a positive outlook on everything, this kind of positive representation of disability within films should be kept up because its nice to see. Finally, I also thought the script was very strong, the movie didn't go over the top or so farfetched that it wasn't realistic, most of the scenes were logical and made sense and actually took into account the characters limitations it just made it more tense to watch as it didn't take you out of the movie and never got too ridiculous, I also thought the script was structured very well to build tension and the dialogue was effective.My two slight negatives for the movie would be its lack of establishing the two leads relationship and the occasional predictable or odd character decision. I did think the movie had slightly rushed pacing at the beginning, it would have been nice if the movie spent more time expanding and developing the positive relationship between the mother and daughter instead of the slightly repetitive beginning and teasing something sinister straight away an extra ten/fifteen minutes would have done the trick. I also thought that the film occasionally slipped into genre tropes with some predictable or odd character decisions, there was a few decisions from the characters especially Chloe that were very predictable in order to progress the plot and some odd decisions to be so open with her mother even when she suspects her that weren't logical but this was only occasionally and thankfully not all the time.My next few positives would be the clever character decisions to build tension, the jumpscares, character depth and amazing plot twists. I thought that the character of Diane played by Sarah Paulson was so clever and manipulative in turning the narrative to make her daughter seem insane or to make herself look better it built the tension between both characters very well and was very cleverly written. The movie also had very effective jumpscares, it didn't rely on them which I loved as it was more about the dark themes and the tense atmosphere, but the jumpscares that were used were effective, shocking and took me by surprise so were therefore not predictable and well set up. I also thought the character depth for Diane was excellent, when the movie showed her losing her child and her stealing the child all the pieces meshed together, I understood despite the insanity of the character her point of view and her genuinely believing she was helping her because she didn't want to lose her new daughter gave the character some much needed if not slightly disturbing character depth. Finally, the plot twists were truly shocking and amazingly executed, wow I didn't see those twists coming, I knew something more sinister was at work but where the movie went with the characters I was just not expecting it, I was slowly more and more entertained and on edge as the movie went on.My final couple of positives would be the amazing final act and the shocking ending. The movie final act was just incredible, it was intense, powerful brilliantly acted and I genuinely didn't know what the outcome would be that is when you know a movie is well written and constructed, I also found the ending very shocking the role reversal between the mother and daughter was unexpected but the message was conveyed clearly and the shocking effects of her mothers cruelty to her was on full display in a twisted but satisfying ending.Overall, Run Is an extremely intense, frightening and clever movie with a strong script and fantastic performances from Sarah Paulson and Kiera Allen. It made me on edge from beginning to end, it fell into a few horror/psychological thriller tropes but for the most part was a refreshing and intense film that worked very well, I would recommend!",Run

80,flicklover,"Very effective, well acted little thriller.",9,24 April 2021,"Run had bern a film that I had heard good things about but hadn't gotten around to watch it. I have to say that I was impressed by how well made and tight the film is and how it uses all of its 90 minutes to great suspenseful effect. It is a very simple premise but done very well.Run stars Sarah Paulson as Diane. A woman who is seen in the beginning of the film having just given birth to a premature baby. It seems tgat the child had many health problems. The film forwards to 17 years later. We learn that her daughter Chloe, played by Kiera Allen. She is bound to a wheelchair. She has many health problems and doesn't leave her house without her mother who apparently take good care of her. She is homeschooled and very intelligent. Her mother Diane seems to be very devoted and protective of her daughter. Chloe starts getting curious and startes investigating the medicines she's taking and her mother gers more protective and prevents her from using the internet at night and limits her phone calls. She's hiding something and Chloe sets out to find out more. No more spoilers. Needless to say this film is very involving and suspenseful. The performances by both women are excellent. Especially by Kiera Allen, who is actually in a wheelchair in real life. Her performance is really good. Sarah Paulson is extremely effective as the over protective mother with something to hide.The film is directed by Aneesh Chaganty. He directed the excellent thriller Searching with John Cho. That film's premise is also very simple and bare bones but he knows how to create great suspense with good performances and effective atmosphere. There are some plot points that are far fetched in Run but they are necessary for suspense. I was completely invested in the story. I hope to see more from Aneesh Chaganty in the future.Very good thriller.Grade: B+",Run
81,movieman6-413-929510,Thrilling thriller with good and appropriate acting.,7,17 July 2021,"Run is a new thriller directed and written in part by Searching director Aneesh Chaganty.The film is about the teenage girl Chloe (Kiera Allen), who is in a wheelchair and who is further educated and cared for by her mother Diane (Sarah Paulson). When Chloe feels her mother is acting strangely, she tries to find out what's going on. She learns that her mother is trying to keep a dark secret from her that she must unravel from her wheelchair.This film comes across as a psychological thriller where you as a viewer don't know what exactly is going on or which of the characters is telling the truth. Thanks to the story, the film is quickly reminiscent of the book by Stephen King Misery, which also has a film of the same name. The film is also self-aware of this, as there are some hidden hints in the film that link back to Misery's story as well as to other Stephen King stories. The story of this film can seem a bit familiar and if you think about it, it can miss some details. This way you can enjoy the film more if you don't think about everything too much.The acting is done well and appropriately by the film cast. Kiera Allen is disabled by an unexpected complication, forcing her to live in a wheelchair. Together with the filmmakers, she saw this as the right opportunity to play in this film. Kiera herself saw this as a good challenge to finally play a big film role from her small theater roles. Hopefully, thanks to this role, she will be able to break through in the film world. Sarah Paulson also delivers good acting as a nurturing mother who also hides a dark side. She knows how to switch between these two different sides of her character.",Run

84,bazookamouth-221-898097,Well acted,6,3 April 2021,I thought it was absorbing to a point and it went off the rails about midway. Sarah Paulson (Diane/Mom) was creepy enough and skilled in manipulation until she gets found out by a strange medication bottle mistake which was used as a catalyst for the daughter to go in suspicion mode which carries the movie for the second half. The best part of the movie was the daughter (Kiera Allen) attempt to escape the room from the roof. Second half it becomes a little silly. Still very watchable.,Run

89,TheCorniestLemur,He did it again,7,13 June 2021,"Searching was easily one of my favourite films of 2018, so of course I was keeping an eye on this director. Honestly, I'm not sure why it took me so long to get around to this film, but now that I have...I mean, it's hard to think of how it could have lived up to Searching, and to be fair, it doesn't.It's nowhere near as creatively directed although it is still fairly impressive, and bloody hell there is a lot of plot convenience in this.*Mild spoilers*For instance, if a young girl comes into your pharmacy clearly panicking, desperately demanding to know what this medicine you sell to her mother for their dog is and what it does, and she then asks you what it would do if a human took it, and then said mother comes in and the girl has a full on PANIC ATTACK, what would you do? You would call the damn child support services is what you would do, but then the movie would be over, and we can't have that.*Spoilers end*I mentioned that because that was by far the dumbest scene of the whole film to me, but there are quite a few moments that had me thinking it was pretty bloody stupid. And while we're talking about the plot, I should mention that I really didn't like the ending scene. Maybe some people will find it satisfying, but to me it just came across as really nasty, mean-spirited, and out of character.But overall, I liked what was happening, it's just that the ways they got there were really freaking dumb.Sarah Paulson and Kiera Allen are both really great in this, and on a little less personal note, I'm sure it's nice for the disabled community to know that Kiera Allen is actually a wheelchair user in real life, and I think it added a lot to her performance.The more I think about it, the more I realise I wouldn't have liked this nearly as much without the main character being disabled, because it really does make this whole film so much more tense and creative than if she hadn't been.And aside from some really cheesy music, I can't really complain about much else, so my verdict is to still look forward to anything else Aneesh Chaganty makes, cause he's hit two for two so far.",Run

91,danybur,Chloe's challenges,7,4 April 2021,"ExcerptRun is a psychological thriller with a hint of horror that presents some scenes of extraordinary tension, posed and solved with ingenuity. The film sports a suspense that never wanes, but clearly wins when it focuses on its disabled protagonist and the challenges he faces (a notable portrayal of newcomer Kiera Allen) and becomes more conventional in the scenes they share with his mother (Sarah Paulson).-------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------ReviewRun begins with a disturbing prologue: Diane (Sarah Paulson) observing her newborn daughter and warning herself of the illnesses and disabilities she will suffer.An ellipsis leads us to Diane and her teenage daughter Chloe (Kiera Allen) living in a comfortable and secluded house. Both have incorporated the routines derived from the treatment of the various pathologies of Chloe, who is anxiously waiting for an acceptance email to start her university life. But the young woman will soon begin to enter the terrain of doubts and mistrust.Aneesh Chaganty's film starts from the psychological drama to delve into the thriller with hints of terror, with a suspense that does not wane. The best parts of the film are those by Chloe, with an exceptional performance by newcomer Kiera Allen. The psychic and physical challenges that the plot poses to the young woman are thoughtfully posed and resolved through situations that generate a lot of tension; these scenes constitute the best of the film (the soundtrack, at times, accompanies very well). But the story becomes more conventional and even melodramatic in the sections where Chloe interacts with her mother.As often happens lately in many films that begin with good plans and well-constructed and dosed initial sections, at times in this one the credible one is in danger of being shipwrecked, even in the case of a genre film. And unnecessarily, too.However, in the final section, the director and the script somehow achieve a synthesis, successfully reconciling all aspects of a film that brings together more than one topic from the Stephen King universe.",Run

100,MovieBuff11732,A Thriller That Was Actually Thrilling!,9,25 November 2020,"Run is the newest Hulu original film. It was originally supposed to come out on mothers day but then got moved to November. If I saw this on mothers day, I wouldn't have wanted to spend time with my mother.Run is about a mom named, Diane (Sarah Paulson) who is really protective of her daughter, Chloe (Kiera Allen) because of how sick she is. Her daughter then suspects that her mom is keeping a dark secret from her.Run was a film I wasn't planning on watching because I don't have Hulu and it didn't seem like something to get Hulu for. I still wouldn't get Hulu just for this movie but that doesn't mean its bad. I was at a cabin that had Hulu and I watched this film at the cabin. I was utterly surprised. I thought this film wasn't going to be that good but ended up being something much better. To start, the story was wonderfully crafted. From start to finish it had me on the edge of my seat. The only thing I didn't like about the story was one little bit at the end. I just thought it didn't need to be there at all. Besides that the story was wonderful. It was cool to see how the mother and daughter bonded at the start. It showed that they both actually did care for each other at one point.The acting in the film was probably the best part. Kiera Allen as the disabled girl was a fantastic choice. She needs a wheel chair in real life so it added to the performance a lot. I bet if they got someone else that wasn't in a wheel chair, the part would have been portrayed a lot differently. Sarah Paulson gave a marvelous performance. She always plays such a creepy person in movies. This film wasn't her best but it was a darn good performance. The daughter and mother were really the only two actors in the film besides for some other little parts that some characters had.As I said in the title, this film is actually thrilling. There are a lot of movies that just aren't scary at all that have been coming out. The two films this year that actually freaked me out are Run and His House. His House is a marvelous film I would defiantly recommend checking out. This film was a nail biter though. It had you asking many questions to your self during the movie about character decisions. The main character wasn't dumb or anything but the mom was the one that made you think. There were also some really intense sequences were the main character had to get something done but the mom was pretty close to her. Those always make me freak out a little bit. Overall, the film was incredibly intense.Run put you in the shoes of the main character and got you onto the edge of your seat. I would recommend this film to anybody that likes thrillers or if you have Hulu. It is defiantly one of the best films of the year.",Run

Not quite in the same way, but most of us have felt trapped during the time they made this and in some ways a lot can relate whether that be with relationships, life or jobs etc. We have at times felt a victim. In fact I doubt there's not one person in this pandemic that hasn't felt trapped in some way or restricted.

Run isn't quite as good as that, but it is still a very stellar second feature. Sarah Paulson is definitely good, but it's Kiera Allen who is the real star here, carrying scenes based off of her performance alone. The mystery is admittedly simple, but it's the tense direction that carries this to the finish line, and kept me gripped from start to finish. The story develops really well, and the structure of having the flashback scene at the beginning is fantastic, and sets up the mystery brilliantly.

125,IamROCKAS,"When life gives you pills, you either open wide or question what you're getting",6,5 July 2021,"""Run"" is a more tame movie than one would expect. We get to follow a wheelchair-bound teenager, who also suffers from other life-threatening conditions. Her name is Chloe and she is a badass and she was one even before having to deal with the horrific situation in the movie. With all the handicaps, she still strived for proper education and I've got to admit, her engineering skills are far superior to mine, even though I completed 4 years of physics and engineering education. Well, mostly physics, I only had a few courses in engineering, electronics, telecommunications, and electrodynamics, but I wasn't a good student and anything about 3D printer wiring would be foreign for me. Going back to Chloe, she displayed advanced problem-solving skills that are impressive, to say the least.The plot was rather simple and short but it still had a plethora of memorable moments. One of those came around the middle of the movie. It goes to the category that has no name but can be described as a ""scene that starts with you thinking what the hell is the character doing and ending with you thinking that is actually clever, leaving you feeling stupid to doubt the character"". Jeez, that's a long name... Either way, the scene I had in mind was the one where Chloe used a bunch of extension cords, a soldering iron, a cloak, and a mouth full of water to escape her room. If you haven't watched this movie - no, I haven't made this up and you have to watch the movie to figure out how this works. This scene is clever in multiple ways but seeing how our protagonist has a handicap of not being able to walk too just makes it even more impressive. Besides that scene, we had many revelations that are either predictable or just come off as natural to the plot but everything fits the entertainment spectrum.(I'll just use this space to also mention that the actress Kiera Allen, who played Chloe here, uses a wheelchair in real life too.)What failed to impress me was the amount of the role of mother. Don't get me wrong, Sarah Paulson did a phenomenal job playing her but in the end, I can't think of a better word to describe her as a Karen. Some people might be offended by the use of that word but that's just the best word for the verb of an entitled egotistic woman that I know. I knew that she was hiding something from the movie description but the way she treats her ""daughter"" is saddening. It was good for the plot but her reasoning was questionable and barely motivated by anything that isn't selfish. In a way, she is a true villain in every sense of that word. But on the other hand, she has so many layers of plot armor that it's impressive that she made it to the end of the movie without being caught for her devious actions. The pharmacy, the altercation with the mailman, the hospital... the amount of red flags that she is actually dangerous and her daughter is in danger is impressive, I won't lie, but it's also absurd. The only thing that would make her character work crazily was if Chloe managed to finish her message, someone actually stayed in her room (seriously, there must always be someone present when treating attempted-suicide victims) and she still managed to get an upper hand. In this scenario, the psychotic determination would make her villain arc come full circle, instead of just giving her open doors to do what she pleases all the way.Overall, I can't say I disliked this movie. It's good even, though ranking it with other movies I liked is difficult. It's short in comparison, barely reaching 90 minutes, and it's rather an easy watch that doesn't leave any ambiguous messages or any cravings for more action. It's a decent dish that provides that fulfills your needs and doesn't leave you craving for seconds. If you're looking for something casual to watch, this is a good choice. Some say that this is a horror but from my perspective - it's not. It starts as a mystery but ends as a thriller. No jump scares or gore is involved. The only things that might be difficult to swallow are some taboo subjects but nothing here ever goes off the rails with crazy.",Run

The film knows its visiting time, and with a running time of 1h20min is a relatively short film. That's good, because it probably would not have lasted for a longer playing time.
The acting is really good and it's a damn good choice to cast Kiera Allen. Firstly because she is a wheelchair user, and secondly because she is exceptionally good. She needs to be watched. There are a few flaws in the film in terms of when she gets the pills and the fact that she has been paralyzed for a long time.
The twist is cool, but the film also jumps into a lot of typical family thriller clichés. Fortunately, the film does not fall into jumpscares.
There is a subplot with a star-shaped scar on the mother's back that is never explained, and a deleted scene should have explained it. But if a scene can explain an entire plot, then is it worth having?

I found the story to be intriguing and believable along with the acting makes this a pretty solid movie.
The ending of such movie is important. I don't think the director have nailed it in this case, since obviously the mom will be locked down for good for a murder, nobody really cares under which terms that is.

I wasn't intrigued when I watched the trailer because it was a film that has been done so many times and it feels like he took an idea from every drama movie surrounded by this storyline and added it all into his film. I expected more from him since his directional debut Searching (2018), was fantastic and even though this was a common film I thought maybe there was a twist but sadly it was already done before making it annoying and predictable.The composer Torin Borrowdale knows how to really set the thriller atmosphere. No matter how repetitive the movie was I was impressed by the suspense in certain scenes and the music set it perfectly making me feel very edgy.Sarah Paulson and Kiera Allen's performances were fantastic but I couldn't deeply feel for the mother because it lacked depth in the script making me not be able to feel for her situation.

Maybe set the year back to the 80s and it'll seem more natural.All hell of suspicious broke loose just because of one pill. I guess if you take something long enough you kind of forget why you're taking it until you really stop and question about your wellbeing. It's a new pill but that's just the tip of the icerberg that got the ball rolling.As I'm writing this I'm still not convinced that a girl being overprotected and poisoned for 17 years can be happy. They ought to be miserable. And since the Mother did help her live through it all and now on the path to college, this makes the Mother even more creepy what she's been actually doing. Although acting is good, but she doesn't strike me as the mental illness type.The story went downhill when the incompetent mailman failed to rescue the girl. Small town guy didn't even put up a fight and lingering when his intuition clearly knows something's wrong. Yeah, you see a 17 year old girl like that, take her to the police immediately, you stupid. I know the movie had to reel her back into the house, but there are much better ways to do it that could add a lot of points.I strongly suggest to make an alternate ending, without the current creepy ""I'm doing this to you in a wheelchair 'cause you did it to me for the last 17 years"". This idea is from another movie, can't remember which one on top of my head. It's not necessary, and overthrows the whole point of barely surving a catastrophe. The right ending should be a healthy girl getting her wishes and graduating from college soon to be hired by an institution specializes in helping disabled people. Or, that engineering thingy she was really into back in her room to connect the dots. With the current ending, now, I feel like it's hereditary and those two are really related afterall.Good acting.",Run

Hope that doesn't pass as too much of a spoiler.Sarah Paulson displayed a great performance, as she always does.

197,Jac23443,The Act Part II,7,18 December 2020,"This movie was a well put together story; probably the most surprising thing about this movie is the limited cast and powerful performances. It does well in creating this claustrophobic and isolated setting for the main lead after she is presented with the harsh truth of her ""mother"" when she decides its time for her to leave the nest and go to college. That was a nice touch for the movie to take plot wise, it didn't present some unrealistic and terribly cliche conflict for the film to take flight. The daughter becomes skeptical about the mother when the mother's stories and decisions become questionable. I really enjoyed watching the movie, I just thought the ending sucked. This movie plays out like 10 Cloverfield Lane, where the buildup is solid and well paced, and the ending just destroys the entire process because its so outrageous and outlandish that it doesn't fit the initial presentation of the story or its characters.The greatest thing a film can do is bring a reasonable closure to its leading actor/actress and end there... like Scream, its the most satisfying ending in my opinion; but no... this movie decides to have the ""daughter"" treat her ""mother"" the way she was treated at the end of the movie which really took away from Chloe's innocence; I think if they had never put that pointless crap at the end of the film, it would be way better! The ending was just very frustrating to be honest. However, I definitely say this is a solid movie and has some great acting and even though its predictable and a bit cliche, the performances are enough that this becomes such an easy and enjoyable watch.",Run

She can also play a character that has a mix of both. That is what makes her stand out so much. Her talent is remarkable.Kiera Allen has arguably the more difficult role. She plays it brilliantly which is vital for this film to work. She has the talent for a good future in the industry which is so hard to succeed in.If this movie had stretched out longer the plot holes may have it collapse. Every movie has plot holes. But if it made well enough they become irrelevant. That is the beauty of film making. But with its relevantly short running time run benefits from that too.Very enjoyable and the references and maybe inspiration are not concealed so in no way is this a rrip-off of other great movies. There was an element, maybe unrealised or inspired, of Rear Window too just from the desperation as opposed to the obvious similarities that this film contains.For a thrilling watch I would recommend this to anyone. It is not a timeless classic. It is a well made gripping thriller. No silly jump scares. But there was one scene that made me jump out my skin.

But if you like films like Misery then you'll definitely enjoy this one.It's well acted, well directed and shot and it's a gripping film that really keeps you on the edge of your seat until the climax.
I've never seen Sarah Paulson in anything I can remember but she's absolutely great in this, she goes through a range of emotions and characteristics and does so flawlessly, she's quite scary at times. I'm definitely going to hunt down some more of her films after seeing this.Keira Allen in the other main role, is relatively new to the acting scene and she was equally impressive, she plays a disabled girl and I didn't realise at the time of watching that she is actually disabled in real life.

Stock standard 90 minutes is all you need in a good thriller. Sarah Paulson was good as usual, but may be starting to get type cast in this kind of roll. Kiera Allen was great as the protagonist and once the plot got going she really made the film. It was never over done, and most of the characters decisions seemed plausible and what you probably would do, you could say it was 'cliche' free. The isolated small town setting, the cool weather, and the effective yet simple soundtrack really kept things feeing real. It always comes back to the story in the end, whether a feature costs 100 million, or 100 dollars, we're here for the story, and this was a good one.",Run

Edge of the seat suspense, the most thrilling thriller I've seen in ages! Sarah Paulson has proven her talent in past roles and she does not disappoint in this film! Kiera Allen is perfection as daughter Chloe. They were so believable, it was as though they'd worked together on other projects. I was bowled over at Kiera's seemingly all-natural talent, especially considering her youth and lack of acting experience! Of course the screenplay and excellent direction are a major factor, and this team gave us a winner. So often there are remakes and a low budget movie that raises our hopes, only to leave us longing for more thrillers like those we saw long ago. This was a very pleasant, welcome surprise, as I kept my expectations rather low, to avoid disappointment once again. No special effects or tricks are needed to get your pulse racing, the characters have it covered. It may not be for everyone, but if you have wished for a well-made, well-acted psychological thriller, grab your popcorn and drink. Get ready for actual thrills and entertainment.

Paulson plays the mother of a handicapped daughter who might be deliberately making her sick so she won't have to be alone. We've seen this material covered in both The Act (also on Hulu) and Ryan Murphy's The Politician (albeit in a much more comic light), but this is the most horrifying version of the DeeDee and Gypsy Rose Blanchard story to date with more emphasis on creating suspense and terror than pathos or laughs. The suspense is strong here and there were quite a few moments where I was on the edge of my couch, anxious about what was to happen next.",Run

The movie tells the tale of a loving mother who takes care of her physically handicapped,but extremely smart child.She's old enough to go to college now.She knows her science and is fiercely independent.What the creative team manages to achieve with this premise is absolutely fantastic.They manage to create suspense out of such little moments.There is great build-up,stakes are raised and then the payoff.The brilliant performances help a lot too.Kiera Allen knocks it out of the park.While one can nitpick about few details,at the end of the day the movie is an exhilarating watch and all is forgiven from my side.This would've been an awesome watch in a theater",Run

Her Diane is equal parts warm, loving, and terrifying.

233,brittanydiane,Very cringy movie and here's why,3,22 November 2020,"So this movie was horrible to watch if you are a parent. It really made me furious to watch this because who in their right mind would poison their own kid? I get that in the reality of this movie she kidnapped the girl and was doing this so she wouldn't leave her, but this was pretty messed up. I have never felt so disgusted with a movie before and this really tops it. This is why I give it a 3. So if you enjoy watching a disabled person struggle to move around and fight for her life then by all means watch this. Plus the ending too with her going to prison to go visit her mother was a bit much. Why would you keep calling this person mother? Even after everything that she had put her though.Also should be noted is that there was a part of the movie where Chloe goes to the drug store to find out what medication her mother was giving her and the lady end up telling her it is a muscle relaxer for dogs which her mom ends up finding her there at the drug store, takes her home and calls the pharmacist to tell her to lie to her daughter about how safe it would be if she was giving it to her... Now this should be a red flag to the pharmacist, but nope she still is getting away with poisoning her daughter since there were no cops called to the home. Just weird instances throughout the movie that would throw caution flags for anyone else to get her out of that scenario.All in all this is a one and done movie. Meaning I would watch this once and never EVER watch this again.",Run

I thought I was watching a quality, independent film. Boy was I surprised. If we are going to rate movies, we need to know if they start off as mediocre made for TV type movies or actual pay money for movies. Yes, I know this is supposed to be a pay for movie, but it is not. It is TV type hype from beginning to end. It might as well have Valerie Bertinelli as the mother and Selena Gomez as the daughter. Made for TV movie might be a six start. Pay money for movie, it never crawls out of a three. If you want to watch this nevertheless, then read the synopsis and scan to the last 20-25 minutes.

Despite the fact that there are only two main characters and much of it takes place in one location, it never feels stagnant at all. Fantastic performances! Sarah Paulson is always good, but it was Kiera Allen as the teenager in a wheelchair who blew me away. First off, she's so FAST in that wheelchair that I wondered if the actress really is in a wheelchair. Yes, she is. And that's part of what makes this so cool. The heroine of the thriller is in a wheelchair in the movie and in real life - and she's pretty kick ass!",Run

Sarah Paulson was also great, not an inch shorter than Kathy Bates!Anyway, I don't want to spoil anything but make sure you watch this movie - it is great!",Run
246,Brandon_Walker_Robinson,"I was searching for a good movie in Run, but instead I will just run back to a good movie in Searching",5,22 November 2020,"This is a new film on Hulu by Aneesh Chaganty (and co-written by Sev Ohanian), following up their cinematic debut Searching (2018) with a thriller involving a mother and her 17-year-old daughter born with several complications (arrhythmia, hemochromatosis, asthma, diabetes, and most impactfully paralysis).I will say that it's possible this movie is better than I liked it, but if so it would be for its directing and acting, and less so about the writing. I felt like there were holes everywhere, and perhaps too much is thrown at us too soon for us to properly care for the characters and their situation. This kind of movie has been done before, without much new added to the table minus the wheelchair aspect. There were a lot of elements set up for what could have provided a stronger ending delivery and punch, but most of those beats were one-note and used up earlier in the film rather than connecting a strong inner-weaving as Searching was able to do.I went in blind, and it's likely better that I did given that the trailer is somewhat revealing. I don't think it had a high enough ceiling in the first place to eclipse any wild lack of expectations I already had. My only expectation was in the hands of the creators, and the most redeeming quality this movie will likely have on audiences is I hope they become aware of Searching and see it at some point... which is what I hope most of you all can take away from this. That was my favorite film of 2018, and Run will fall to the wayside as somewhat compelling yet completely forgettable. The story and pre-built relationship just did not have enough juice once the credits rolled.",Run
247,Sickpuppy365,Walk swiftly towards this one,6,21 November 2020,"I chose to watch this movie without reading the description or ratings on IMDB, and I also did not watch any trailers for it. I am very glad I did that because after watching (and thoroughly enjoying) it, I went and watched the trailer... Which essentially showed the whole movie but in less than two minutes... I now understand why some people hated this film. However I cannot agree with that sentiment.
Many reviewers are describing it as rehashed, predictable and full of plot-holes... I don't think the trailer helped because it showed too much of what is a relatively simple, but not overly-used plot. I suppose many people don't realize that this film deals with a subject that is a real phenomenon, it has a medical name and everything, but is little known and hard to believe. Also, as many arm-chair quarterbacks are guilty of, it is easy to point out characters blunders and short-comings from the laz-e-boy with the benefit of being able to see all the way to the periphery of their situation on the big screen in front of you...
Here are the facts... Sarah Paulson brings a level of sinister to her character that I was not expecting having seen her in many other films, yet she also evokes empathy throughout. Newcomer Kiera Allen shocked me with how well she played against the veteran actress, displaying a natural acting ability that assures me she will have a successful career in Hollywood, despite the fact that she actually does use a wheel-chair in real life...
The cinematography is super solid utilizing static camera work, mid-closeups and camera angles which enhance the suspense and story-line.
This is a competent drama/ thriller, it is not a ""horror"" movie, and it is paced well, rationing out plot-points, and building the suspense and anticipation to a climax that will leave you satisfied with the end result... Which is a 6.5 IMHO",Run

Turns out after I read up on her she is paralyzed in real life. Not that it even makes a difference based on performance. She sure made a hell of an impression on me!

It's not a bad film, it's even good for what it is, it just didn't keep building up as a story and lingered around the halfway mark.As a side note - It's well framed and shot but the film quality or grainy filtered look they'd shot it on made it feel a little iPhonish for me as well.",Run

And while it's cheap-popcorn fun to hate pretty much any recent Arah Paulson character, the thrill feels sick and tawdry afterwards, as in: Need a shower. Here's a challenge, or two: (1) Do not write or discuss a script while not of sound mind, and (2) Write a part for Sarah Paulson that allows her to be likeable or at least relatable. The writers & producers of this one missed the boat on all of the above. Direction is tight, with one of the best tracking sequences I've seen in a while - for that, and the first half of the movie, along with Kiera Allen's performance, it gets a '5'.",Run

This movie is really intense, the acting is really on the mark and makes you feel anxious. I'd say pacing is good as well, with a good transition from normalcy to horroresque. My main problem with this movie is that there are many plot holes that kind of bring you out of the emersion. Things that you just know feel off, or just shouldn't really work. The story is also predictable, and i could usually guess where it was going to go (though there were sometimes that did not follow that, so i will give them credit where it is due).

315,AGuyNamedJake,Bad Pills = Great Medicine for a Fun Movie Night,8,24 November 2020,"In this simple, but fun plot, director Aneesh Chaganty maintains a tight narrative, executes some brilliant editing, and draws out from his two female leads nail-biting performances that make this thriller well worth a watch.OBLIGATORY PLOT RECAP: Chloe is a highly-intelligent, capable 17-year-old girl with a slew of physical disabilities and ailments. Regardless, she is looking forward to shrugging off her small-town life and heading to college, that is, if she can escape the control of her manipulative mother whose dark secrets run deeper than Chloe fears.Sarah Paulson has practically made a career out of playing insane characters who simmer behind her eyes, leaving you a bit frightened about when she's going to lash out. And, as usual, Paulson delivers her performance in spades. Watching her character struggle to maintain control when her world begins to crumble is terrifying because you know that whatever bad she's done still isn't the worst she can do.Kiera Allen, who plays the wheelchair-bound Chloe--and who is disabled in real life--makes her feature film debut in ""Run,"" and holds her own against Paulson's veteran-level acting chops. Allen makes you feel every bit of suffering Chloe goes through. She never stops for a second to lament her circumstances, but forges ahead as all good proactive heroines should!It's a shame watching the media parade around ""strong female characters"" like Captain Marvel, Rey Palpatine, and Mulan who are nothing more than Mary Sues in their own stories, when brilliantly written female characters like Chloe are struggling to be noticed. This movie made me think of 2019's ""Crawl,"" starring Kaya Scodelario, who played another wonderfully-written female character whose courage, wit, and proactive approach to conflict was character-driven and not magically bestowed upon them because the plot demanded it.I feel like some critics are being unfairly harsh on this movie. David Fear over at Rolling Stone called it a two-star ""misstep,"" while Jeannette Catsoulis at The New York Times insinuated that it's a bad thing that the movie doesn't rely on flashbacks. Are you kidding me?! My screenwriting professor taught me that flashbacks are the laziest form of storytelling and I agree. They're a cheap way to fill in the blanks, and ""Run"" is far more clever than that in how it unfolds its backstory.""Run"" is a very simple story and will feel predictable to many, but it's got a few nice twists and turns that will still keep you guessing. The performances of the leads are what will grip you the most, especially Allen's-who knew that watching a character try to write a single word with a crayon would make me cheer for them? You can do it, Chloe!",Run

330,Laurenosaur,Good acting - bad everything else,3,22 February 2021,"Let's start positive. Who doesn't absolutely love Sara Paulson? She's fantastic in this, no denying. The girl playing her daughter is brilliant. I've seen that it's her debut, which means great things to come from her I'm sure! They created some really tense moments. Unfortunately, the acting is the only positive for me (save the last ten seconds but since it's literally one line I can't include it with script writing).
Now, negatives. The actors did the best they could with the script they were given. It should have also been a comedy because WOW some moments were laughable. The entire scene when the daughter crawled out the window was ridiculous (again, still acted amazingly though for how ridiculous it was). It made no logical sense. Someone with asthma THAT bad is not going to undertake a severely athletic journey, have a checklist of all these things for an incredibly over-the-top window break (I'll get to that in a second), and not remember to bring her inhaler. I'm sorry, not buying that for a second. And that window break?! Like, super cool, but super unneeded. I guess it was supposed to show off how intelligent she is, but in the same motion lacks all logic. No way would she have struggled with that cord (which miraculously didn't get caught on the window sill at the extension cord part), water, and a blanket when ALL she needed was a blanket (wrap blanket around arm, break window, lay blanket down and crawl over as she did). The over-the-top writing (for that scene in particular but generally throughout) really takes me out of a movie. Don't add ridiculous situations to create drama - use realistic things to create the drama with a movie like this. Even a usual trope of almost falling off the roof would have worked better than unnecessary squirrel cheeks. And the flashes of potentially interesting writing were just forgotten (or maybe cut? But either way the result is the same for the viewer). What was up with the mothers scars on her back? That could have been really interesting, but nope. Shown and not mentioned again (unless I really misunderstood something... but I truly don't think I missed anything, pretty sure it was just never explained). Bad writing like that drives me crazy.
As most horror movies generally are, there is no originality in ideas here. It's basically the Gypsy and Deedee story (real life story, made into the show The Act) mixed with Misery. But you have to at least TRY to improve or add something... yet both sources of ""inspiration"" are far superior to Run. Honestly what sent me over the edge and made me write this rant of a review was when I looked through the cast. They have a character actually named Kathy Bates. NO. JUST NO. They are ripping off Misery, AND using the name Kathy Bates?! It's like they're acknowledging what they're doing and having a laugh at it. It doesn't sit right with me.
Anyways, by the end of this movie I felt very let down. I never thought I would hate something Sara Paulson had been involved with so much, but here we are. And as much of an awesome performance she gave - save yourself and watch Ratchet for the same kind of vibe from her. If you're looking for the sick kid aspect, just watch The Act. And if you're looking for the kidnap and held helpless vibe, go to the classic Misery. I would honestly avoid this one.",Run

339,vchung-05758,A simple yet superb thriller with great performances,9,21 January 2021,"Run is a thriller directed by Aneesh Chaganty and starred Sarah Paulson and Kiera Allen. Kiera Allen stars as Chloe, a young woman excited to go to college but is unfortunately plagued by various illnesses that necessitate the constant care of her mother Diane, played excellently by Paulson, who has homeschooled her ever since she was young. The film is mainly set in their house, and from the start there are already hints of underlying tension slowly developing between mother and daughter as Chloe begins to suspect her mother of keeping secrets from her.The plot is simple enough. Chloe is a wheelchair-bound young woman who begins to notice something strange about her mother and her secretive manner and strives to understand more about her situation. Kiera Allen, herself a wheelchair-using actress, plays Chloe as a sheltered but resourceful young woman trying to understand her mother's increasingly sinister-seeming actions, played with a sense of vulnerability and quiet intelligence. Paulson's Diane is just as captivating, becoming a much more murkier presence as the film goes on. The film is essentially a long cat-and-mouse game between Chloe and Diane, and both women shine in their roles. The tension just ramps up in every scene, and it is a testament to Allen that she can hold her own, acting against someone as good as Paulson.The minimalist setting of the house really worked wonders for the film. The story unfolds largely within the house and the familiar domestic setting becomes a place rife with thrilling tension and paranoia. The film is essentially a series of increasingly tense and elaborate set pieces in which Chloe notices something amiss and has to find various ways to uncover the truth without Diane noticing. One particular sequence involving the outside of the house was particularly heart-stopping tension and showed Chloe's resourcefulness aptly.The film is also very well-shot, with good lighting and framing in every scene, keeping the audience focused on what is important in every shot, keeping them invested, and allowing them to feel the gradually building tension and Chloe's feelings of being lost and desperate. The camera also rarely strays far from Chloe, giving the audience a sense of presence and preserving a lot of tension when the audience is just as clueless as Chloe as to what could happen at any minute.To say any more about this brilliantly made film would spoil it, but between the performances and the tense sequences, this is a very effective thriller that definitely deserves a watch.Score: 9/10",Run

First of all its a film, second of all, everything happened so quickly, from the time that postman got killed till Chloe went to hospital for trying to off her self, everything went really quick!

If it was possible to give zero stars, that would be my rating. However, if ""Run"" was intended to be satire, I'd be much more generous with my stars. This movie was so bad, that I could not turn it off. it held me captive in much the same way that Chloe's crazy mom kept her captive. Plot holes galore. So this young girl lives ""off the grid"" and her crazy mom has free reign to keep her under control? No involvement with doctors, teachers or any social service agency, and yet this young girl is depicted as being seriously disabled. The characters are strictly one dimensional. A few highlights: Chloe wheeling herself into a pharmacy and announcing: ""I'm disabled let me cut in line!"", and then telling the pharmacist that she and her mom are playing a scavenger hunt game which involves identifying a mystery pill , and the pharmacist exclaiming, ""I love games!"" but maintaining her professional ethics by refusing to identify the pill. The pill reference is central to the main plot element. Or, another highlight, Chloe pulls herself out of her window and drags herself around the roof in order to gain access to her mom's bedroom. I thought that scene would go on forever. The hospital ""security"" guys appearing just in time to intercept Chloe's mom who is kidnapping her, (for the second time!) from the hospital. The best thing that I can say about this movie was that I found myself laughing out loud and I am not a ""laughing out loud"" kind of person.

The first one is looking for entertainment factor when they watch a film of any genre and the second one has an urgency to compare movies with real life and get really upset when discover plot holes or are asked to suspend their disbelief. Because movies should be REAL to be fun, right? They also get upset if they have ""seen a movie like that before"", which makes the current one old, because they want something fresh based on their prior watch history. So they rate it accordingly.If you are from the 1st group - you will likely enjoy this film.

""how she does this for so many years without any suspicion from anybody?"" etc.. First of all, makes me wonder, is it possible when she took the baby from the hospital that no-one suspected her? The first thing they could search was for mothers they had lost their babies, they will be No 1 suspects, and I guess was not so many to be difficult to find her!! Or when the daughter went to the pet clinic why she just didn' t say to everybody there that her mother give her those green pills that was for dogs? In the end why she hasn' t find her real parents? And it' s a little bit stupid for me that she keeps seeing her mother-monster after all that she' s done to her, and take a ""revenge"" by giving her the same pills, but ok!!

That is, if you've seen more than a handful of thrillers in your life.The movie is good but the actors are great. They are why I rated this movie a 7. You'll get what you'd expect from Sarah Paulson: excellence.

It does its job of making you feel uncomfortable and the acting from Sarah Paulson and Kiera Allen was very convincing. I didn't think it was a great film, but worth a watch.

397,harikrishnan_88,A Solid Thriller.,7,24 November 2020,"First of all, let us forget the fact that this film's director's first film was Searching. If you start comparing Run with Searching it wouldn't do justice to this film. Run sets up a mysterious tone with Chloe, the protagonist who is paralyzed leg-down, growing suspicious about her mother. We are hooked to the screen from the beginning, confronting the conflicts through the perspective of Chloe. This is a very wonderful debut for Kiera Allen who plays Chloe. Sarah Paulson makes us apprehensive with her expressions throughout the film making us distrust her. Aneesh Chaganty proves to be innovative even though at the end of the film you get to take a simple story with you.
The simple story may make you underestimate the film getting to know it through the course of the film makes the viewing experience so exciting. This is for sure a one time watch but that one time you watch is gonna be a great ride which you won't regret. Don't compare the film with Searching but we can't call this a bad film at all. Give it a watch.",Run
398,DimmySz,"It is not the best suspense film of all time, but it is one of the best in recent years.",7,4 April 2021,"I didn't watch ""Searching ..."" but if it is at the same level of quality, I will definitely go after this film. Before watching ""Run"" I had the information that it was a horror film, but as the film rolled I realized that it was actually more of an investigative thriller, and the problem with that is that many people can get frustrated after watching the movie for putting it in the head that it is a work of terror.That said, let's start: A teenage girl in a wheelchair was living her life normally until something made her start to suspect that her mother was hiding something.I'll start by writing about representativeness, there's a phrase that actress from the main character Kiera Allen (who is also in a wheelchair) said in an interview that is '' I am a person. Disability is part of my identity, but it is a part. I am many other things. And that's what I saw in Chloe too, whose identity as a disabled person is central to the film, but it's not the film. '' This phrase defines the film, showing that the physically disabled are also people and that they can star in a film or series with themes that do not necessarily speak about the deficiency in their characters. In addition, I need to talk about the performances, starting with Kiera Allen, the actress that the character needed, precise interpretation, the interpreter managed to pass all the feelings of the character very well, from surprise to fear. Sarah Paulson is an actress who has heard from time to time but has never seen her film, but I definitely go after her other works, here she plays a more mysterious, careful and sweet character at the same time, which makes us in the beginning create empathy for the character even though she hides something, and I congratulate the script and the performer for that.Now the script, all the occasions don't seem to be by pure coincidence, everything seems to be meticulously thought out, except for a moment in the film that made no sense to me, all the dialogues seemed very natural and well articulated, I also congratulate to the direction of Aneesh Chaganty, very precise cuts in the montage increasing the suspense, although in some specific moments there are some detailed plans that to me seemed quite unnecessary, because a more open and a little longer plan could be used in that specific moment of the film.Technically speaking, the feature film is just OK, the photography did not have any moment of prominence, the soundtrack is also not very amazing, but the sound effects are very good, this kind of thing we only notice when it is very good or when it is very bad, in this case it is good, chords used at the right times even though it is a cliche in horror mainly, but in this film it is more used in creating the suspense.In resume: It is a film where you expected something but received something different, but you will not be disappointed with the film.Note 7,6 / 10,0.",Run

I understand this was made more for TV and wasn't supposed to be extremely long, I just wish there was more suspense/build-up to the climax (which ended up also being underwhelming). The twists do seem good but then also when you think about it you're like: hmm I probably could've guessed that would happen. I thought the girl who played Chloe (Kiera Allen) as a newcomer was phenomenal and held her own next to Sarah, a seasoned actress who performed this role with nuance and deep emotion.

420,kcamp75-574-121288,Awful,1,12 February 2021,"I couldn't even bear to get through the entirety of the movie due to lack of plausibility. Poor writing and plot hole ridden. For the life of me I cannot comprehend how this was highly rated and reviewed. I couldn't make it past 18 minutes as up to 18 mins and X amount of seconds the entire premise would be solved with a sentence, or two, by the protagonist at the pharmacy. Employing just a modicum of logic breaks this whole movie. I could not be bothered with wasting my time watching characters behave only in ways that sustain the nonsensical and poorly written ""plot"". The actress playing the daughter is great, Sara Paulson is great. If you want to see two great performances in a doofus level endeavor, have nothing else to do and have exhausted your recommends on NF, Prime, Hulu, Peacock - ad infinitum - go for it.10 minutes in, I had to rewind to see how I missed the part that instigated the daughter's suspicion - turns out I didn't, it came about suddenly and poorly at the introduction of the daughter. The moment we're introduced to her, the suspicions are there. What drove her to check the prescription label? Why didn't she take the bottle with her to the pharmacist - she knew she was going to go, she took the pills with her...SCAVENGER HUNT????? I LIKE GAMES????

The script, by Aneesh Chaganty (also the director) and Sev Ohanian, is good enough to get to know and develop the two characters, find out what the problem is and reach the climax. It may be a simple story, but it is still excellent.

Nobody thought to investigate that? No? Seriously?! Now THAT would have been an interesting storyline, but it was BARELY touched on.If you read that spoiler I wrote and thought ""ooh this movie DOES sound interesting!"", it isn't.

Or even more...to leave it AT FREAKING SIGHT so close to Chloe?For the victim its an ok script but the lack of human emotion on the hospital, and around the end feel so cheap that the simpathy that was created towards her is efectivly shattered, thats if there was any left after her M:I style scene where she has EVERY SINGLE THING in hand and even more does not seems to get realy hurt by anything that happens.It is not a bad movie per se, camerawork is good, actors give it a try but it boils down to a unexceptional movie to watch only if you really have nothing else to see.If you are looking for something better: ""Misery"", ""Hush"" or ""Don't Breath"" certainly offer a better bang for your buck.",Run

She's unable to walk, and doing her poorest attempt at crawling on her belly - goes out her window to break into another room where there isn't a locked door, SOMEHOW kept a mouthful of water just so she could spit on the window that she touched her hot soldering iron to in order to break it... I was like what did I just watch? It was like they decided to apply a Rube Goldberg machine tactic to this sequence. Good giggle though.Later, the 'big reveal' is where the daughter is a 'captive' in the basement... where there are just tons of items conveniently laying around that explain pretty much everything. Mom stumbles in and sees that daughter has found her shoebox of secrets that was just laying around and has this look like ""how ever did you find my box of super specific backstory information that I so carefully took pains to lay out in the open?""

488,sb06226,"The storyline is a C, but the acting is quite good",7,22 November 2020,"So as many reviews have stated, there was a certain amount of predictability to the film. I will call BS on people 'knowing everything that would happen' - I doubt they knew it would end how it does.The complaints I saw in the reviews are mostly people unwilling to embrace the suspension of disbelief, and I think that is their loss. Of course there are things in here that are farfetched and inaccurate... short of BBC films, you will find that in pretty much every movie. Just because you happen to understand the medical jargon going on in this one doesn't make it less believable than the film you had no 'real world' knowledge on. I think this is a pet peeve of mine.Common complaints again, talking about how a woman could kidnap a child and make her sick, and nobody would notice. WHHHHHHHHHHHHAT? It's like you folks have never heard of munchausen by proxy. It happens a bit more than you'd like to think. They specifically address how this goes under the radar by her use of veterinarians, the fact that she has changed her primary doctor 12 times in a short period of time, home schooling, etc. Are there holes in the plot here? Yes. But they do try to fill in most of the gaps.Another complaint is why the daughter doesn't really do anything to stop her mother. Sharp objects around, etc. But this is, until a week ago, a mother who she believed loved and took care of her. Stockholm syndrome can kick in as a teenager, after a shorter period of time (i.e. Elizabeth Smart who might have been rescued months before had she been able to speak up). Children who are abused frequently can't retaliate. This aspect is not at all far fetched.Like I said, there were parts of the story that were predictable. You knew from the previews that mom was making her sick. Not far in, after seeing how isolated she made them (and the fact that it was clear she wasn't going to let her daughter leave the house), you assumed something else had transpired (ie the kidnapping). The part at the end where she is slipping mom the pills - I did not see that coming.To the acting, Sarah Paulson was great. She did a great job with the subtle creepiness. When the daughter is looking things up online that first night, they do focus in on Sarah after she gives up (sitting in the kitchen watching her try to google things)... but it would be a lot easier to miss her already sitting there when the daughter comes down the stairs.I think the actress who plays the daughter is still coming into her own, and I definitely don't think this is the best genre for her, but she wasn't bad.While predictable - I enjoyed the movie. It is a more subtle, creepy film. I also think they have a lot of nuanced stuff going on with accessibility that went over a lot of reviewers heads (like where mom's escape is only thwarted because the wing is not accessible).I will say, the part where she ninjas out her window, into her mom's room, back to her room (for the inhaler), was just a little ridiculous. :)",Run

Why did the daughter never pick up one of the many sharp or blunt objects around her and hit her mom? The mom leaves all her important documents in a box sitting out and labeled? Why would she tie up her daughter's wheel chair and not her daughter? This is how the whole movie goes. The only redeemable quality of the film was Sarah Paulson's super creepy acting.

Lets start You can predict the ending within the first 10 minutes leaving the whole film feel oblique. There are so many plot holes that its almost a comedy, For example Chloe, the daughter, goes to a pharmacy to find out what pills she is exactly taking, then proceeds to find out its numbing medicine which sends her into shock, the stupidest part is she then proceeds to sit in silence and not call for any sort of help whilst her mother then somehow magically disperses the crowd around her without raising any suspicion leaving you feel like this is just to unrealistic to enjoy. How an earth You can steal a child without getting caught and kill a mailman and leave his van out in the open without raising any suspicion makes the film even more comedic,Overall this film feels like a typical poorly written thriller which there are many off.. If you can look past the stupidity and poor writing then this film may be ok to you, The acting actually wasn't too bad aswell.",Run

526,georgetaylor-96122,Misery (for anyone sucked into watching this),1,12 April 2021,"Tried to rip off the film Misery, except this version went from a thriller to a comedy in 15 minutes due to the ridiculous storyline. If only Chloe had just called the police/childline when she found out her mum was poisoning her, we wouldn't have had to endure this utter dross. Having said this, Chloe did a fantastic job of breaking out of her bedroom window when ""Mom"" locked her in. It's just a shame she forgot her inhaler so had to smash through another window to return to her bedroom. She managed this by breaking the glass with water she held in her mouth (obviously!!), a very elaborate and well thought out plan, although maybe next time carry your inhaler in your pocket... just a thought! Unfortunately the list goes on for brain dead moments. Tom taking an age talking to Chloe with his back turned to the ""Mom""... stalling just long enough to get stabbed in the neck, great work Tom! Or the ease at which ""Mom"" wheeled Chloe out of the hospital, she's still got the kidnapping knack after all those years! Either that or the hospital staff had totally given up on the film much like myself and most likely the writer too. The bar for Netflix originals is low but they've smashed those expectations out of the park with this one. I hope my first ever IMDB review saves just 1 person from this nonsensical lifewaster! Instead spend the 90 minutes watching Shawshank or Joker again, even an Arsenal match. If you are a gunner you'll now truly appreciate just how bad this film is! :')",Run

The whole premise of the film is one which has been done to death which made everything about it incredibly predictable. There was no suspense really, just bad writing which causes you to sit screaming at the TV in shire frustration at the awful decisions the characters make (again, entirely predictably).The film could have been over in the first 20 mins if the girl had just told the pharmacist that her mum was giving her animal medication.The acting was pretty good - Sarah Paulson plays the same almost crying, unhinged, wingey, irritating character that she plays in just about everything else she's ever been in.Lazy, frustrating, predictable, brainless....

And a lot of the same is happening over and over. I'm about to expose something so if you don't wanna know don't read further.

The two main characters were played convincingly but my favourite was Kiera Allen. Her face and voice were extremely expressive and I would love to see her in other leading roles in the future.
The only thing I didn't quite like was the ending. I understand that the filmmakers wanted to satisfy the viewers' instinsive desire for revenge but this means that Chloe remains hostage of her ""mom"" instead of starting to live her life at last.",Run

541,lauraleewd49,It was okay,6,3 April 2021,"Sarah Paulson was great. As usual. She played her part well.However, the films writing wasn't all that great..We went from Chloe being the happy doting daughter to immediately suspicious over one pill.And of course, her abuser knew instantly.Too much, too soon. There was no build up, no suspense. There was no guessing if the mother was the bad one or the daughter was crazy. No twists or turns to keep you guessing.Of course we have the same old story. Big house in the middle of nowhere. No cell service. The victim is isolated and has no friends.Massively stupid plot points.Like, Chloe's phone call to the random stranger asking him to Google things for her when he's in the middle of a fight with his girlfriend, but he Googles it anyway. I mean, come on!Then the pharmacist believing chloe about the treasure hunt. The mother asking said pharmacist to call her daughter and tell her she's not on dog medicines. It bordered on the ridiculous.We have an incredibly sick and disabled child, yet no social worker?The most ridiculous of course being no medical professionals putting 2 + 2 together and realising just who Chloe and Diane actually are.It's a shame, cause the storyline would have had so much potential.Also, one puff of an inhaler during a stress induced asthma attack never works. Film writers need to speak to some asthmatics and write this condition better or give their actors different conditions!Over all, the film is watchable, but leaves a lot to be desired.

There is no real building of tension, and everything is too over the top to make it feel even remotely believeable or powerful.As the topic the movie explores is such a serious and sensitive subject it should be treated in the same way, but this movie somehow manages to make it feel like a cheesy gimmick.They tried to include so many different layers which ultimately failed to add to the 'horror' as .
