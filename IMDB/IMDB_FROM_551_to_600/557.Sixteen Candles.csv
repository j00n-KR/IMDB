0,TheLittleSongbird,Charming and very funny,8,24 November 2010,"The story may be a little uneven in structure and perhaps tone, but overall Sixteen Candles is hugely enjoyable. It is both a very charming and very funny film. As to expect, the production values are excellent, and the soundtrack is cool and memorable. The script is both funny and smart with a keen ear not just for the idiom of teenspeak, but also genuine sympathy. The pacing is good, and the direction is solid, while the acting I have no qualms with either. Anthony Michael Hall is perfect as the nerd who tries hard to impress, but to me this is Molly Ringwald's movie as she adeptly personifies the sulky sweet teen whose day goes from bad to worse. Overall, charming, funny if slightly uneven. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Sixteen Candles
1,Leofwine_draca,Not bad for a teen rom com...,6,22 October 2016,"John Hughes' first film as director is SIXTEEN CANDLES, a fast-moving and complex high school romance with a little salt and verve to make it eminently watchable. I certainly found it to be a superior piece of work, better than later and better-known movies like FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF, because it has a little more edge and hardness to do which makes it a more realistic movie.The story is your usual stuff about loves and rivalries with sex, of course, playing a big part in the proceedings. Where this film shines is in the characterisation; everyone feels real and raw, dealing with real-life issues that anyone who's been a teenager will be readily able to identify with. The cast have been well chosen for their parts and Molly Ringwald is a particular delight here. The likes of John and Joan Cusack show up in support and Anthony Michael Hall is as goofy as ever. The only real flaw with this film is the racist depiction of the Asian kid, which is over the top and leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Otherwise, as a celebration of the 1980s complete with great music and outlandish fashions, this is fun.",Sixteen Candles
2,SnoopyStyle,Beginning of a golden age of teen movies,8,18 October 2013,"Samantha Baker (Molly Ringwald) is turning 16 and nobody remembers. Everybody is busy dealing with her sister's wedding. Everybody is freakishly embarrassing. Her grandmother feels up her boobs. They bring a weird exchange student Long Duc Dong. (Let's face it. That was racist even at that time.) She's infatuated with the attractive Jake. There's a dance, a party, and all kinds of hijinx.This is the start of the golden age of John Hughes teen movies. It introduces the wonderful charms of Molly Ringwald. She would personify the girl next door type for that era. It would also introduce Anthony Michael Hall as part of the Brat Pack. It's also great to see the Cusack clan get a couple of roles.The comedy is broad and goofy. The best part is that it comes from a sense of good humor and a nice soft spot in his heart. It is a more innocent time in suburbia middle America.",Sixteen Candles
3,Hitchcoc,A Slice of Teenage Life,6,2 December 2016,"I don't know why, but I've always found Molly Ringwald tough to watch. There is a snarl that is part of her being that doesn't appeal to me. Nevertheless, she does a decent job here as a poor ignored girl whose birthday is forgotten. Then we have a bunch of juvenile jokes, designed to appeal to, you guessed it, juveniles. I think a lot of the people who liked this movie, see this time in their lives in the characters. Once again, like with the breakfast club, we have all these persons with prescribed traits, interconnected. They come and they go, but there is not real connection. As a matter of fact, they would be at opposite poles in real life. We know that things will work out in the end and all will be well with the world. Nothing wrong with that. It's just not all that engaging.",Sixteen Candles
4,kosmasp,Coming of Age,8,31 July 2019,"People who watched this back then and were the right age and were in the right mind set to do so - it's very likely they will cherish and love this. Same goes for Breakfast Club - and they would not even want to hear anything about movies aging. I personally wouldn't say that (although technology has moved on), but you can't blame other people who didn't watch it back then or have seen other movies, some maybe even influenced by this and not finding a common thread or something to really hold onto here.So a Birthday is a central theme of the movie, which is fitting since this is about growing up, becoming an adult and all the trials, tribulations and other ""fun"" stuff that comes with that. This is not about the odd ones of course - which makes it interesting to say the least but might not be everyones cup of tea ... enjoy the quirkines if you can",Sixteen Candles
5,gavin6942,Among Hughes' Best,8,24 June 2014,"A young girl's ""sweet sixteenth"" birthday becomes anything but special as she (Molly Ringwald) suffers from every embarrassment possible.There are some things to be concerned about when watching this film. There was clearly some level of racism with the Long Duk Dong character. And there is a moment or two where the movie seems to suggest that sexual assault is permissible when a woman is drunk or passed out.The second is really hard to defend. If Hughes is on record concerning it, this would be worth tracking down. The first, however, is intended as ironic -- we see the way the grandparents treat Dong and the laundry comment is meant to reflect poorly on them and their ignorance, not on the Asian community. Hughes may not be Mel Brooks, but he was able to turn the tables on occasion.Beyond those concerns, this is a pretty great coming-of-age movie, not all that different from ""Say Anything"" a few years later or ""Can't Hardly Wait"" a decade later. We get Anthony Michael Hall at his finest, and a wonderfully dorky John Cusack. High art this is not, but the epitome of a teen movie it is. Few before or since have reached its level.",Sixteen Candles
6,Woodyanders,80's teen comedy blast,8,18 April 2018,"Smitten teenager Samantha Baker (a delightful performance by the spunky and adorable Molly Ringwald) has a crush on popular hunk Jake (the handsome and charming Michael Schoeffling), who's already spoken for. Worse yet, her family get so caught up with her older sister's impending wedding that they totally forget her 16th birthday. Writer/director John Hughes keeps the enjoyable story zipping along at a snappy pace, maintains a likeable lighthearted tone throughout, presents believable teen characters, astutely nails the joy and anguish of adolescence, and manages a few tender, touching, and thoughtful moments amid all the often raucous and uproarious humor. Moreover, it's acted with aplomb by a tip-top cast: Anthony Michael Hall brings a utterly disarming cocky swagger to his breakthrough role as a brash and persistent geek, Paul Dooley shines with his a lovely portrayal of Samantha's harried, but humane dad, and Gedde Watanabe has a field day as happy-go-lucky foreign exchange student Long Duk Dong, plus there are fine contributions from Haviland Morris as foxy babe Caroline, Blanche Baker as the ditsy Ginny, Justin Henry as sharp-tongued younger brother Mike, Max Showalter as the hearty Fred, and Billie Bird and Edward Andrews as a pair of doddery grandparents. John Cusack, Joan Cusack, and Jami Gertz pop up in small roles. A total hoot that not only delivers the expected laughs, but also proves to be really sweet and occasionally moving as well.",Sixteen Candles
7,Tweekums,Great directorial debut from John Hughes,9,8 January 2014,"The '80s produced many great high school and this one is a lot of fun. It is Samantha Baker's sixteenth birthday and it starts badly her entire family are so wrapped up in her sister's upcoming wedding that they forget Samantha's birthday. To make matters worse she is convinced that Jake, the boy she loves, isn't even aware that she exists; to make matters worse he is dating one of the most desired girls in school. Unlike most films of this type Jake actually feels the same way about her but neither can bring themselves to tell the other. The school dance looks like it might provide an opportunity but the only boy to approach Samantha is one known as 'The Geek'. He tells each of them how the other feels but it seems they are still unsure and seem unlikely to get together especially when Samantha heads home and Jake goes to a party with his girlfriend.Before watching this I'd assumed it was a 'chick-flick'; more of a romance than a comedy. While there are obviously romantic elements it is also a very funny film; many of the laughs provided by Anthony Michael Hall who plays The Geek and Gedde Watanabe who plays Long Luk Dong an Asian boy who gets lucky at the party. Molly Ringwald does a great job as protagonist Samantha; it isn't surprising that she would work with Director John Hughes. Hughes does a fine job in a genre that will make him famous. The plot is fairly simple but it was nice to see it avoided the cliché of having a girl like popular guy who in reality isn't good enough for her then for her to end up with the unpopular guy who is better for her. It was more fun to see who 'The Geek' did end up with anyway. There isn't much to offend here but some may be put off by the occasional obscenity and a fairly brief nude scene. Overall I'd say if you enjoyed 'Pretty and Pink', 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' or 'The Breakfast Club' you will almost certainly want to watch this too.",Sixteen Candles
8,moonspinner55,Issue-free teen comedy mixes youthful cynicism with old-fashioned sentiment...,5,17 June 2006,"While it isn't exactly Woody Allen, John Hughes' ""Sixteen Candles"" has some wild laughs and it's blessedly issue-free, but most of the big gags misfire and I wasn't sure how much more I could take of Anthony Michael Hall's squeaky-voiced overacting. Molly Ringwald, playing sort of an updated version of the '50s smart-talking honeybunch, can't believe no one in her family remembered her sixteenth birthday, and puts up with the persistent come-ons of a nerdy Don Juan while dreaming of a date with the class hunk. The subplot about Molly's older sister and her wacky nuptials is a laughless drag, and the sequence where sis is doped-up is a real loss. Better are the quieter moments where Ringwald contemplates her loveless future, chats with her dad on the sofa, and gathers her courage at the school dance to talk to her dreamboat. There's enough slapstick here to keep most people happy, but writer-director Hughes buries his strengths in cartoon gross-outs (and continued to do so: five years later he was still doing the same thing). ** from ****",Sixteen Candles
9,BandSAboutMovies,I still like this movie,7,10 April 2020,"Sixteen Candles was the directing debut of John Hughes. He wrote this film after asking his agent for headshots of young actresses and was so inspired by Molly Ringwald's photo that he put it over his desk and wrote this movie over a weekend just for her.Filmed primarily in and around the Chicago North Shore suburban communities of Evanston, Skokie, and Highland Park, Illinois - where Hughes spent his teen years - with fifteen-year-old leads Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall, this movie would go on to start the Brat Pack, who dominated the theaters, hearts and minds of the mid 1980's.Samantha ""Sam"" Baker wants her sixteenth birthday to be the start of her amazing new life, but everyone has forgotten it. Her sister Ginny is getting married, her grandparents have taken over the house and her dream man, Jake Ryan has no interest she exists.To make things worse, she must deal with Ted (Hall), the geek of all geeks, who is so in love with her that he tries to take her panties to win floppy disks in a bet.The actual story of the movie is pretty simple. There's a dance, a party and the hijinks that ensue as the result. Along the way, Sam and Jake find love, Ted finds Jake's ex-girlfriend (Haviland Morris, Gremlins 2: The New Batch) and there's the introduction of one of the most racist Asian caricatures of all time, Long Duk Dong.This movie was also one of the first films for Jami Gertz and John and Joan Cusack. Plus, there are cameos by Zelda Rubenstein (Poltergeist) and Brian Doyle-Murray, which please me to no end.Much like Revenge of the Nerds, the Caroline/Ted scenes can be seen as rape today. Then again, some think that she's an example of the upper class being taken down and re-educated by the lower class. Your mileage and upsettedness by this scene may vary.Does this movie exist in the same universe as the other Hughes movies? You bet. My evidence? The same moving shot of the exterior of the high school at the opening of the movie was refilmed - with the same motions - for the end of Weird Science.If John Hughes was alive, I'd ask him how damaged he was by having his extended family stay in his house. Between the Home Alone films, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation and this film, it keeps coming up in his work.This movie came out when I was 12. As such, I fell in love with Molly Ringwald and wondered why no girls like her existed in my town. The truth was, this perfect person only lived in one place: the Shermer, IL inside John Hughes' mind.",Sixteen Candles
10,sunwarrior13,A Girl's Sixteenth Birthday,10,28 December 2014,"Sixteen Candles is a coming-of-age comedy was written and directed by John Hughes.It tells the story of a High school sophomore whose family have completely forgotten her 16th birthday since her older sister is getting married the following day.It stars Molly Ringwald, Michael Schoeffling and Anthony Michael Hall.Samantha suffers silently as her family forgets her birthday. What's even worse is some total dork keeps hounding her with romantic innuendo when she has no feelings for him whatsoever as her attention is simply towards a high hunk named Jake.But in the end,she managed to celebrate her birthday with sixteen candles and a kiss from Jake.This is definitely a memorable and bittersweet comedy about two of the worst thing that can happen in a girl's sixteenth birthday.While the screenplay is far from being perfect,the cast is definitely appealing and they give life to the characters.It is a movie that that viewers from all ages will appreciate aside from teen-agers.",Sixteen Candles
11,studioAT,A good early John Hughes film,5,26 October 2016,"John Hughes was the genius behind such great 80's comedies like 'Pretty in Pink', 'Ferris Bueller' and of course 'The Breakfast Club', and this was his first attempt at the genre.All the elements that would make his latter films so beloved are here, as of course is the ever delightful Molly Ringwald. There are some lovely moments of comedy, and some real heart behind it.I didn't feel that this film was as complete as some of the later Hughes outings. It was almost as if he was trying lots of things out to see what worked. This therefore made for a bit of a mishmash of a film.You can't argue that the final scenes are lovely though. They are romantic, they're funny - John Hughes just excelled at writing these films. It's perfectly, enjoyable, and while it didn't grab me like some of the formerly mentioned films, it is still an example of a genius at work.",Sixteen Candles
12,hitchcockthelegend,I've never bagged a babe. I'm not a stud.,7,15 January 2010,"It's Samantha Baker's 16th birthday and her family are so wrapped up in her sisters impending wedding, they have completely forgotten Sam's big day. Not only that but she has the hots for school hunk Jake Ryan who, apparently doesn't know she even exists. Her existence, however, is noted by freshman Ted ""The Geek"" who lusts after her at every opportunity. Being 16 really isn't all it's cracked up to be, maybe?John Hughes directs his first feature film and sets out his marker for the career that was to come for the astute observer of teen angst and coming of age drama.Featuring Hughes faves Molly Ringwald (Sam0 & Anthony Michael Hall (Ted), Sixteen Candles is frothy on the outside but not without cunning substance on the inside. It's the sort of film that is easy to forgive its obviousness on account of its understanding of its characters, something that Hughes was a master of. Even as we run through the staple requirements of the teen comedy movie (dance, party, making out etc ) Hughes manages to avoid the cliché pitfalls of such sequences by fuelling them with believable patois. His cast, with the exception of the dull Michael Schoeffling (Jake), are sparky and engaging throughout. With the Cusack siblings, John & Joan also showing up in the strong supporting cast. There's an Asian exchange student thread that some have tried to paint as stereotypically offencive, but that is nonsense! Gedde Watanabe ensures the role is the fun and harmless one it's meant to be.The soundtrack is kicking and very at one with the story (another knack of Hughes), it features the likes of The Specials, The Revillos, Billy Idol, The Stray Cats and The Thompson Twins. And the Evanston, Illinois location work really fleshes out the feeling of the piece.Not just a film for 80s nostalgists then, one for pretty much anyone who was 16 and had their emotions pulled all over the place. 7/10",Sixteen Candles
13,preppy-3,Often very funny but also crude and cruel,7,11 December 2002,"A young just-turned-16 year old (Molly Ringwald) is madly in love with a high school senior (Michael Schoeffling)...unaware that he has his eye on her too. She's also being constantly annoyed by the Geek (Anthony Michael Hall) and has to deal with with her conceited, obnoxious older sisters wedding and her truly rotten kid brother (Justin Henry).Ringwald is just perfect in her role, Schoeffling is tall and handsome (but no actor--he appears uncomfortable all the time) and Hall is uproarious but I didn't really like the movie. There are some very funny lines and moments but they're overshadowed by some truly cruel jokes (the scene where her grandparents joke about her body--and her grandmother feels her up--is beyond belief), some very unfunny jokes, racist jokes (Long Duck Dong is NOT funny), and some very crude ones. There are good chunks of this movie that just don't work--they just lay there and get very dull.The only saving graces are Ringwald and (especially) Hall. He's hysterical as the Geek and gets laughs just by his body movements. Even during the serious scenes you can't take your eyes off him. Also there's a very funny sequence when he's talking to Schoeffling in a kitchen--it's all serious but you see him casually making martinis while talking! Also this film does show pretty accurately what it's like for a girl when she turns 16--I have two younger sisters so, believe me, I know! Paul Dooley is also very good--especially in a touching sequence where he has a heart to heart talk with Ringwald.So--it definitely has its moments but it's too cruel for my tastes. Also there's a surprising amount of profanity and even a brief topless scene for a PG movie.",Sixteen Candles

15,Uriah43,Turning Sixteen Can Be Quite Traumatic,6,28 May 2016,"""Samantha Baker"" (Molly Ringwald) is excited to turn 16 because she knows her family has something special planned for her. Unfortunately, because her older sister ""Ginny"" (Blanche Baker) is getting married the next day, everyone has totally forgotten all about Samantha. So as she heads off to school, instead of being happy she has become very depressed. Unfortunately, her day is about to get much, much worse because not only is she being pursued by the biggest geek in school (played by Anthony Michael Hall) but the senior she idolizes named ""Jake Ryan"" (Michael Schoeffling) doesn't even know she exists. At least that is what she thinks. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a fairly good comedy which suffered unnecessarily from a few crude scenes here and there which, quite frankly, could have easily been left out. But I liked it overall due in large part to the excellent performances by the aforementioned Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall. Likewise, having a gorgeous actress like Haviland Morris (as ""Caroline Mulford"") certainly didn't hurt in any way either. Be that as it may, while I wouldn't recommend it to a general audience, all things considered I rate this movie as slightly above average.",Sixteen Candles
16,AaronCapenBanner,First Hughes Teen Comedy.,5,3 September 2013,"John Hughes made a name for himself specializing in teen comedies during the 1980's, since this was really the first one of many(though they weren't sequels)Story has a girl(Molly Ringwald) having her sixteenth birthday being forgotten by her busy family, and assorted craziness going on between an upcoming wedding, unrequited love from a senior, and unwanted attention from the freshman(Anthony Michael Hall). There is also a wacky exchange student staying with them as well(sponsored by her grandparents).All these plot elements don't make for a particularly believable or funny film, which depends too much on broad stereotypes, rather than fully drawn characters. Has its moments, but doesn't amount to much, though it was popular.",Sixteen Candles
17,Aaron1375,"Funny little film from John Hughes, who was basically the master of the teen dramedy.",8,6 October 2010,"I said in my review of ""The Breakfast Club"" that it was my favorite Brat Pack movie and I did not really like any of the others. Not sure if this is considered in that set of movies or not, it does feature two of its stars that appeared in some of those movies, maybe more, but I think of this one as more of a comedy separate for the most part from the Brat Pack mold. This one is also less drama and a whole heck of a lot of comedy. Which is why I like it. It is not as risqué as say ""Fast Times at Ridgemount High"", but I think it is almost as funny. Just nowhere near as sexy as that particular movie. The story is simple enough, a girl played very well by Molly Ringwald has just turned 16. She gets up expecting a fuss over her, but she does not have to worry about them making to big a deal over her sweet sixteen as none of her family remembers. How can her entire family forget you ask? Apparently, her sister is about to get married and the ensuing chaos of planning and in-laws and grandparents coming over makes everyone simply forget. Though I find this a tad unlikely I do not let this highly improbable amnesia deter from the overall enjoyment of the movie. For my money Anthony Michael Hall steals the show as kind of a king of nerds type guy. Out of all the people who belonged to the Brat Pack his resume is one of the more impressive. Molly does good too, but this is a role she did repetitively during the 80's. Not really a departure for her. So a funny movie with a bit of drama thrown in, just not as much as other John Hughes movies.",Sixteen Candles
18,Wuchakk,"Better than ""Pretty in Pink"" but inferior to ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High""",7,9 May 2016,"Released in 1984, ""Sixteen Candles"" stars Molly Ringwald as teen who must enduring her family forgetting her 16th birthday due to the activity surrounding the wedding of her beautiful older sister (Blanche Baker). Anthony Michael Hall plays a geek wanting to have sex with Ringwald's character, but settles for false evidence and the corresponding respect of his friends. Michael Schoeffling (who looks like a young Matt Dillon) plays the girl's romantic interest while Haviland Morris plays his hot girlfriend. John & Joan Cusack have small roles.Unlike the okay-but-unremarkable ""Pretty in Pink"" (1986), ""Sixteen Candles"" is a fun and quirky teen dramedy. While not great like 1982's ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" or 1995's ""Clueless,"" it's a solid high school coming-of-age drama/comedy from beginning to end. The movie was written & directed by John Hughes, also known for the more popular ""The Breakfast Club"" (1985) and ""Ferris Bueler's Day Off"" (1986). I can tell Hughes wasn't a rocker because all his teen dramedies contain soundtracks consisting of bland new wave music as opposed to the awesome rock/metal soundtracks of ""Fast Times"" and 1993's ""Dazed and Confused."" The movie runs 93 minutes and was shot in suburbs north of Chicago.GRADE: B",Sixteen Candles
19,Sylviastel,Still worth watching again and again!,9,13 May 2006,"I too remember seeing this film in the movie theater with my dad and sister. The film is typical John Hughes fare. It's about a 16 year old girl played of course by Molly Ringwald. She does a superb job as the girl who is never really embraced in the high school life. She is rather treated more like an outcast than actually accepted. She is part of the crowd but not as popular as her sister Ginny played by Blanche Baker. She is lone and forgotten on her sixteenth birthday. Her family is too busy dealing with the wedding of her older sister, Ginny, and out of town relations crashing for the weekend. What a cast too, you have Carlin Glynn playing Mom Baker and Paul Dooley playing Dad Baker. Justin Henry plays her annoying younger brother, Mike. The in-laws are played by Billie Bird and Carole Cook. The laughs just roll in too. Liane Baker plays Sam's best friend. Anthony Michael Hall plays the Geek. Havilland Taylor plays the girl of every boy's dreams, and Michael Schoeffling plays the beautiful Jake. Anyway, the writing is pretty good, the cast is excellent, and the scenes are unforgettable. Also John Kapelos plays the hunky groom and Zelda Rubenstein plays the pianist. ALl in all, it's a great film with a happy, unrealistic ending.",Sixteen Candles

21,Smells_Like_Cheese,It's carbon dated,7,17 October 2005,"""Sixteen Candles"" was a great movie from the land that was the 80's. All the girls from my work were talking about the 80's teen flicks and how much they loved them. I had never seen a Molly Ringwald film, after all I'm only 20. But the girls were still incredibly shocked when I told them, they told me that they will not respect my movie opinions until I saw all the teen flicks from the 80's. We're talking crazy here people: Sixteen Candles, Pretty in Pink, The Breakfast Club, Say Anything, Weird Science, etc.So far now I have seen the major Molly Ringwald films. Pretty in Pink, The Breakfast Club, and Sixteen Candles. Sixteen Candles is a very cute film that came before the cliché 90's teen flicks. It's original and very funny. I think the reason why it's so popular, is because everyone can relate in some way to the characters. Molly, a shy ignored outcast, The Geek, well, he's a geek, the jock, he's expected to date and act a certain way. It goes on and on. I really enjoyed Sixteen Candles, well, I guess it's on the way to Say Anything! Wish me luck, y'all! :D 7/10",Sixteen Candles
22,MovieAddict2016,"Ah, the '80s.",6,12 October 2005,"It's odd to see John Hughes commenting on high school through the eyes of a teenaged girl - one might think he is more apt to model himself onto another male, but it's a strength to his writing skills that he can just as effectively convey the trials and tribulations of a young woman. (Rather than just a man such as in, say, ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off."") This is essentially the film that made John Hughes famous, and one of the most defining films of the 1980s (along with ""The Brekafast Club"" a year later, this gave birth to the modern teen genre and the stereotypes inherent and loathed in most of the genre today).Molly Ringwald plays Samantha, a blossoming girl whose family forget her big day - the Sweet Sixteenth when she finally becomes a woman (at least in her own eyes).Samantha has a crush on the school's most popular kid and a geek (Anthony Michael Hall) has a crush on her, and she doesn't return to the feelings.The movie is predictable, but that might have something to do with our familiarity with modern clichés of the genre based on this film itself. I imagine when it was originally released it wouldn't have had such a pre-existing familiarity with viewers, although then again, maybe it did...and that's why it was such a success.This is far from John Hughes' best film, but it is an effective teen comedy and one of the better ones to come out of the 1980s. It's good for what it is.",Sixteen Candles
23,ElMaruecan82,Bittersweet sixteen...,7,6 October 2019,"""Sixteen Candles"" plunges us in the hearts of darkness according to John Hughes: the troubled and tormented mind of Samantha Baker, a young woman at a junction of her life where all the lights seem against her. She's celebrating her sixteenth birthday and it's all quiet on the upper front: no growth spurt in the right parts, no significant revolution. As far as Sam Baker's sexual life is concerned, it's 'Apocalypse Now', still in Saigon, living the ride of hormonal 'valkyries'.And it didn't help that her parents forgot her birthday and that Jake, the boy that tickles her hormones, played by a poor man's Matt Dillon; doesn't even notice her. To her parents' defense, they were preparing her sister's wedding, to Jake's defense, he was already engaged with Caroline, the popular girl who can get any guy by a snap of her fingers and makes the likes of Sam totally invisible in the pyramidal hierarchy. Sam owes her misery to two women, one who's got the bod to attract the charming princes and another who's used it purposefully.Woman is a wolf to woman and in that unforgiving microcosm, Samantha Baker can only hope to attract other kind of predators, they're called geeks and there's a certain truth within the correlation between geeks and sex obsession. Still, Ted (Anthony Michael Hall) plays in another league and he's isn't much into sex than a certain knowledge allowing him to brag in front of his chums (one of them played by a young John Cusack). Being a virgin isn't a big deal if you can get close enough to steal a kiss or harbor a trophy like a picture or an underwear.Sex is the alpha and omega, literally, it opens the gates of heaven while marking a certain closure, a coming-of-age. Not just boys as Hughes show girls as desperate, pushy or needy as men and that might be the one alibi the film can get from any accusation of degrading women or condescending. However, there seems to be a fundamental difference: girls want to experience love to have sex or at the very least love through sex to the point that it almost plays like a placebo, the illusion of love can be enough, guys don't need 'love' but sex isn't more accessible.Samantha Baker evokes Jake through a question about sex but there's never a moment we'd believe she'd have sex for the sake of it. What Hughes and Ringwald beautifully convey is the idea of a girl who needs reasons to like herself. In the film's most infamous scene, she meets her grand-parents and they shockingly grope her to test how diminutive her chest is, the treatment is twice horrible: she's reduced to her body, her sexual body at that; and yet her adult pride is rejected, they don't see her as an adult and they do treat her like a child.That scene echoes the previous moment where she and her friend were gazing at the naked body of Caroline, wishing they could be like her. Now that moment makes the distinction rather blurry between ""Sixteen Candles"" and misogynistic films à la ""Porky"" where guys are peeking at women in showers, that 'female gaze' seems to acknowledge that the body makes the rule and so does the size of the chest, as if they agreed to go by the men's rules. And previously Jake was talking about how interesting Samantha was, but his friend called her 'void', the choice of word is interesting, what's the vacuity exactly? In spirit? In interest? What makes a woman interesting... maybe being a woman is enough. And Sam feels not being woman enough.Fair enough, so the struggle of Samantha is to reach womanhood in a family where her siblings don't respect her, grandparents treat her like a child and her parents don't even remember her birthday, as if she was symbolically kept in a suffocating infancy. In a bad movie, Sam would compromise and become a 'woman' by laying the cards or playing against age; but the film immerses us in the existential journey of a girl who wants to be attractive without changing much, this is not ""She's Out of Control"" and Molly Ringwald never delivers a false note, it's just a shame that she's got to go through episodic moments that reveal the ugliest sides of Ted and Jake and to some extent even the film.Because the logic is rather flawed, if Jake is the right person for Sam, he's then right to ditch Caroline, then we've got to assume that she had it coming, but does that include being left drunk and half-naked to a bunch of saliva-drooling geeks? Hughes makes great films with important messages but they have a tendency to fall apart near the end, contradicting themselves, like in ""The Breakfast Club"" when Molly ended up with the bad boy who looked at her panties and the Gothic girl giving in to a makeover session. In ""Candles"", it all comes down to Jakes' success by allying with Ted, not a nice guy even if his mean-spiritedness is played for laughs.So just when I thought ""Temple of Doom"" set the feminist fight steps back and mocked Asian people, ""Breakfast Club"" proved me that a certain sexism and racism still prevailed. 1984 was also the same year than ""Karate Kid"", and in comparison, Gedde Wanabe (who plays the Chinese student) is a retread of Mickey Rooney in ""Breakfast for Tiffany"", everything about him (even the romance) is played for laughs. That aspect hasn't aged well.So Hughes asked good questions but the answers are not satisfying. Should I be happy because Sam has found love? I would have been much happier if she could love herself without the help of anyone... that would have made the romance more secondary but no less impactful, so as charming as the ending was, it left me with a taste of bittersweet... sixteen.",Sixteen Candles
24,cricketbat,One of John Hughes' weaker movies,4,27 December 2018,"I love John Hughes, but I'm not a big fan of Sixteen Candles. I think it's one of the weaker movies he directed. It doesn't have the charm of Ferris Bueller, for example, and it's missing the humor of Uncle Buck. I couldn't relate to the characters and it hasn't really aged well. Maybe you had to watch this film as an angsty teenager to truly appreciate it.",Sixteen Candles
25,Irishchatter,You would feel sorry for Samantha!,8,23 November 2015,"This has been the craziest yet the loneliness film I've ever came across. It actually was really to do with loneliness because Sam's family was all over the place with planning the sisters wedding and herself feeling pretty much left out. I felt so sorry for her and the fact, it was unfair that her parents didn't remind her that the grandparents will be staying in her room. I would honestly be so cheesed off with them! Molly Ringwald was really good at playing a girl who wants the best for herself. At least this wasn't pathetic as the film ""pretty as pink"" she was in! I found this film kinda funny too, I loved near the end when the sister was pure drunk and on the wedding day. It really would lighten up your mood unexpectedly! Also I'm glad she ended up with Jake all along!",Sixteen Candles
26,inkblot11,The film that started the careers of John Hughes and Molly Ringwald; still a classic,8,24 February 2020,"Samantha (Molly Ringwald) wakes up on her sixteenth birthday to a chaotic household. Her sister is getting married in two days and relatives have been arriving and filling the house from cellar to attic. Still, she doesn't expect the whole family to forget her sweet sixteenth! But, alas, they do. Too upset to remind anyone, Sam heads off to school, where one of the cool seniors, Jake (Michael Schoeffling) is the object of her affections. Wouldn't you know it, he hasn't noticed HER but the resident Geek (Anthony Michael Hall) is always following Sam, hoping to win her over. That's not going anywhere, in Sam's view. Jake, for his part, already has a girlfriend who is widely admired. But, he knows she's a party girl and that's not him. In actuality, he has cast his eyes on Sam without her knowing it. Between wild teen parties, a Japanese foreign exchange student, overbearing grandparents and the Geek driving a borrowed Rolls Royce, will Sam indeed get to know Jake? This classic film launched the careers of both John Hughes, writer-director, and Molly Ringwald, his favorite muse. Teens loved it then and love it now, for the joy and angst of high school are universal and timeless realities. Hall is a stitch while Schoeffling is indeed dreamy. Also, if any viewer wants to watch the Hughes repertoire, it is a great place to begin for it is light-hearted and fun, before the darker movies like The Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink. Do you know any about-to-turn sixteen year old gals? Why don't you surprise her and watch this one together!",Sixteen Candles
27,ironhorse_iv,This 1984 teen comedy kinda blows. It was not sweet. I really didn't like this movie.,6,17 May 2019,"Written and directed by John Hughes, this coming to age motion picture story of Samantha Baker (Molly Ringwald) trying to get with her high school crush Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling) on her sixteen birthday hasn't aged well at all. This flick from Universal Pictures was really hard to watch. Without spoiling the film too much, it's certainly a product from that era. Full of offensive racism, sexism, homophobic and mental disability slurs jokes. The movie's cultural insensitivity are just plain hard to overlook & laugh. Sadly, it's more cringe-worthy than funny. It's harmful. For example, there is a part of the film that has its two very unlikeable shallow supporting male leads, Jake Ryan & Ted Farmer (Anthony Michael Hall) talk about violating a drunk girl, Caroline (Haviland Morris) as if there's nothing wrong with that. It makes date rape seem alright in the public eye. Not only sleeping with a pass out woman without consent extremely wrong, but putting her in harm's way, by convincing her to go along with an underaged sexual harasser like Ted, joyriding in a stolen car full of booze is reckless. I can't believe all this bad assistance is coming from the film's heartthrob, Jake. Look, I get that Caroline did throw a huge destructive party at his house, but the film acts like she is much to blame because of her floozy ways. In truth, Caroline barely did anything really bad. She really doesn't deserve that type of a punishment. She been friendly to most of the supporting characters. Plus, her brother has died and her boyfriend has been unfaithful for a while now. She's only doing the things she does to get attention. It's Jake that is entirely unsympathetic & malicious. He's the one leaving creepy hateful phone messages to Sam's house, while nonchalantly ignoring and treating his ex-girlfriend like old news. It's sad, because Caroline is the only likeable person in this film for me. I can't believe that the main character went after Jake, knowing full well that he was dating her. What a home wrecker! Sam is so envy of Caroline, because she is popular and developed than she is. To add to that, the sequence where Sam & her friend spy on Caroline in the shower is downright eerie. I felt that there were better ways to explain Sam being desperately insecure about her body than going that. I really wonder, how the film managed to a get PG rating with all the nudity and extremely sexual themes. It really bug me how creepy, every character is in this film. Regardless, Sam is equally just as annoying with all her complaining, yelling & rudeness. I really couldn't stand all that noise. Another individual within the film that disturb me very much has to be horny foreign exchanged student Long Duk Dong (Gedde Watanbe). God, I really hate this character. He is just as bad as the other guys. Dong has every single negative Asian stereotype rolled into one. He's got an over the top broken English accent with malapropisms that are really stereotypical caricature. Then, there is the mysteriously annoying gong noises that accompany him wherever his name is spoken. The film even have Dong crash his car into a tree for comedic laughs. Not a good outlook for Asians at all. Plus, all the jokes with him were not that funny. It's superficial. Another problem with him is the fact that John Hughes didn't even know what nationality to write him as. Is he supposed to be a Chinese exchange student? If so, why does he wear a kimono and scream ""Banzai!'? Better yet, why does he have a Vietnamese-like name? Was John Hughes poking fun at all Asians or was he just a clueless idiot who couldn't write well-define Asian characters? Who knows! Regardless, Dong led to an entire generation of Asian-Americans being bullying in the back half of the 80s and into the 90s; which wasn't good. With below average acting from most of the cast, minus Hall, Ringwald & Morris, unlikeable characters with no depth emotional stakes & poorly done jokes, I really can't believe this movie is consider a classic. If you want to watch it. Take exercise caution. It's a hard sit. Nevertheless, you can currently find it streaming on Netflix. If you don't have Netflix. There are two versions of the film, the original theatrical version on DVD and the version that airs on TV and was released onto VHS during the 80s and 90s. The main different between them is that the pop songs were replaced by generic tunes, as most of the music were just secured for only the theatrical release and not home video sales. As for sequels. In 2003, USA Network was developing one, but it was never made. I kinda glad the project never got out of the ground, because one movie is just enough. In the end. You better off, watching 1985 'The Breakfast Club', instead. At least, that film is more fun to watch than this flick. This candle of a film doesn't shine bright.",Sixteen Candles

29,zkonedog,Teen Hijinx Flick Devoid Of Any Depth,3,5 October 2020,"The tag line for Sixteen Candles seems to hold an intriguing premise: 16-year old girl has her family forget her birthday and goes through the foibles of high school life in the 1980s. Massaged by the writing/directing of John Hughes, one would think a film like this would have some depth to it. Unfortunately, it does not, instead almost exclusively relying on teen hijinx scenarios and sight gags to try and get its points across.For a very basic overview, this film tells the story of Samantha (Molly Ringwald), a newly-minted 16 year-old who isn't exactly happy with that development. The day--long thought of as an adolescent turning-point--seems like any other, totally forgotten by her family, and the angst is palpable. Sam is then subject to any number of family- and school-related indignities, such as her unrequited crush on hunk Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling) and having to deal with the school Geek (Anthony Michael Hall).It's almost hard to believe that just a year after this film was made, Hughes would go on to write/direct the masterful ""Breakfast Club"", as none of what made that movie so special is present here. Instead, viewers are given sight gags much more akin to Hughes' ""Vacation"" films, but in an even more over-the-top fashion. Sixteen Candles is the type of film where goofy sound effects punctuate certain scenes/characters, the fourth wall is broken, and every social/racial/gender stereotype is cranked up to 11, if you will. There is not an ounce of subtlety to be found.I know this film is considered a ""coming of age"" classic, but to be honest I felt a little ""dirty"" while watching it. While certain characterizations certainly do not age well, that isn't even exactly what I'm talking about here. It is more that I found nothing positive from the experience whatsoever. All the characters are so unlikeable that I had an extremely hard time identifying with them and thus rooting for any of them to improve. This was even true in the case of Ringwald's protagonist, who is far too glib and pouty to be someone to really root for.About the only reason I can give this film even three stars is because I can see where an attempt was made (to craft a film about teen issues) and that it clearly shows Ringwald and Hall to be stars (outside of their in-film characterizations here).Thus, Sixteen Candles is a film I just simply don't see the appeal of. For me, it was a far too dour and ridiculous look at the teenage experience, completely vacuous and devoid of any true lessons or character journeys. While I'll admit this was never going to be The Breakfast Club for me, I was disappointed in just how short of that mark it actually landed.",Sixteen Candles
30,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"It may look like cheesy teen romance, but it was the birth of teen comedy as we know it",8,13 January 2009,"As weird as it may sound, ""Sixteen Candles"" is an important film. It's true: a film about a high school girl who has a nightmarish sixteenth birthday played a significant role in shaping movie comedies as we know them today.To start with, ""Sixteen Candles"" was written and directed by John Hughes. Hughes had written a couple films prior to this one for the group National Lampoon's, namely the classic comedy ""National Lampoon's: Vacation."" ""Candles"" marks the directorial debut of Hughes, his first complete film. Why is this of any significance? Well, Hughes followed up this film a year later with a little movie called ""The Breakfast Club."" As if that wasn't impressive enough, in the 1980s, Hughes produced more hit sequels to the ""Vacation"" series, a movie called ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" and created some of the finest films of the careers of Chevy Chase and John Candy. He's the father of 80s comedy and the grandfather of comedy as we know it today.So how does this all ring true in ""Sixteen Candles""? To start, the film takes place in the span of 48 hours. That seems insignificant, but how many classic teenage comedies take place in a short time span? The model even holds true with today's films like the praised Apatow Productions film ""Superbad."" That's just one small example. The real contribution of this movie is its depiction of the teenage lifestyle. Samantha is a typical teenager with typical teenage thoughts and problems on her 16th birthday. Molly Ringwald is a name no one forgets despite her only major films being this and ""Breakfast Club"" because we see a little of our teenage selves in her candid performance. With Hughes help to create such a real concept (getting neglected by her family on her birthday), Ringwald communicates all those dizzying 16-year-old emotions and issues like self-confidence, being misunderstood and of course hopeless romance.The comedic genius plays its way in to all the things that happen to Sam and the completely relatable and/or goofy characters that surround her. The film is one of the first to take what ""Animal House"" did for college movies and apply it to the high school scene, being unafraid to handle the sex and drinking and generally irresponsible behavior. While this idea has since exploded into untold number of movies both good and awful, what makes it stay fresh today is that it doesn't over-stereotype. There are nerds and popular girls and what have you, but Hughes doesn't play up that hierarchy. Sam's love interest, the seemingly unattainable Jake Ryan doesn't have jerk-off friends pressuring him not to fall for the unknown quiet girl. them coming together is the film's goal, not it's plot. While the believability there isn't the film's strong suit, it's not as weak and cheesed up as similar films that followed it.The best part of ""Sixteen Candles"" is how unmistakably real it is. The family drama and goofiness that plays out (the story takes place the day before and of Sam's sister's wedding and the family's in town) is so dead on. We all have grandparents like Sam's that treat us like they treat Sam. We all have embarrassing but necessary conversations with our parents, even if we don't like seeing them on the screen either. Hughes taps into our inner or (depending) outer teenager with sacrificing the humor of the whole situation. If nothing else, ""Sixteen Candles"" could provide anyone with a camera and some confidence to create a movie. This is proof that movies about life in the suburbs can in fact be done well.Complimented with a killer soundtrack, freshmen who look like 12-year-olds paying money to see women's underwear, some great cars and plenty of empty cans of ""Old Style,"" ""Sixteen Candles"" is classic in every sense of the word. There's no denying that it's cheesy and most of the acting is poor outside of Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall (also of ""Breakfast Club"") as the socially courageous geek who is a sweetheart of a troublemaker. (Oh, and appearances by the young Cusacks.) At the same time, it's the nostalgic, lost but hopeful teenage feeling the movie evokes that makes it timeless. It can't be underestimated how much of an impact this film really did have on the future of comedies.",Sixteen Candles
31,videorama-759-859391,"That most difficult poignant age, I loved",8,23 March 2014,"How could everyone in your family forget your birthday. They couldn't. But remember this is just a movie. It follows the trials and tribulations of just turned sixteen, (and no one else knows it) pretty gal, Ringwald. She's truly down in the dumps. She has a big crush on a Matt Dillon type stud, who's dating one of the finest girls in school, and we get to partially see her goodies too, rare for a PG film, where the F word is dropped once or twice. Apart from being constantly taunted by her younger brother, (Justin Henry, clearly a seasoned professional), she's felt up by her gramps, she's boarding a bus daily with eye ogling dorks, and among other things, she's being followed by a dork king, the great Anthony Michael Hall, whose twist of a much better fate, is something you don't anticipate. Ringwald, is just perfectly cast here, I don't think there's anyone who could better it. She's everything the role requires, and it's such a naturalistic performance too, among many other good performers too. Exchange student Watanabe as Long Duck Dong is one of the films perks. Ringwald's older sister who's getting married is a much different contrast, a snooty, slightly Kelly Preston lookalike, who's hogging the attention of little Sis. When choosing to use the word ""a..hole"" at the end of one sentences, shows classic facial expression if I ever saw it. This is part of the reason Ringwalds whole family, has forgot her birthday. C'mon, they'd still remember such an important date. Ringwald's parents in separate scenes, giving her an apologetic heart to heart, I really liked, more so Dooley as Ringwald's Dad. Me with so many others rate this as their favourite Hughes's film, where forget logic, and just get lost in the movie with undertones of real teen angst, where Hughes, like in his other written films, does it in exciting and much humorous ways, with a beautiful ending. I was weirded out with one scene involving Hall, stuck under a low glass coffee table. An eighties movie which is always going to be remembered as a favourite to JH's other films.",Sixteen Candles
32,dee.reid,"Molly Ringwald's sweet ""Sixteen""",8,28 August 2010,"I'm not a die-hard fan of John Hughes (1950-2009), but I've always admired his work. Anyway, here are 16 great things about ""Sixteen Candles,"" the teen-comedy hit of 1984:1) ""Sixteen Candles"" was the directorial debut of the late filmmaker John Hughes, and it's an exciting, funny, sweet, highly quotable, and ultimately touching portrait of a teenage girl's ""sweet sixteenth"" that is really anything but sweet.2) That girl is Samantha Baker (a then-16-year-old Molly Ringwald), and on the day of her 16th birthday, she encounters just about every single embarrassment imaginable.3) Nobody in her big, big fat suburban Chicago family seems to remember her birthday, because they're all more concerned with her older sister's wedding, which is the day after. So you can see why she's understandably upset throughout the rest of the film.4) To top things off, she's got a huge, huge crush on a hunky classmate named Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling), who doesn't even know that she's alive, or does he? Either way, he's about to call it quits with his current squeeze, a blonde bombshell who's more accustomed to partying and getting drunk than having anything to do with romantic relationships.5) To add insult to injury, Samantha is being stalked by The Geek (Anthony Michael Hall), a young wannabe-Lothario who also has the hots for her, and one of her greatest embarrassments throughout the entire picture is at his hands. By the end of the night, however, he ends up getting what he wants - try to guess who (he does make a shocking discovery about who does seem right for him).6) ""Sixteen Candles"" is a remarkable coming-of-age teen-comedy. It's not perfect, but nonetheless it's a promising debut for Hughes, who probably redefined the era of teen films during the '80s.7) The movie isn't just about Samantha and her huge, huge crush. The film does appear to be almost episodic in nature, alternating between Samantha & Jake, and The Geek & Samantha, and a few other minor characters.8) Molly Ringwald was pretty much born to play this part and this is probably what got her career started and helped to define her image as the ""teen queen"" of the '80s. One of Hughes's greatest talents was casting about actors and actresses who looked the age of their part, and casting a then-16-year-old Molly Ringwald in the lead role of his film was one of the smartest casting choice Hughes could have ever made in his remarkably short career.9) Hughes would continue to redefine teen films with his next feature ""The Breakfast Club"" a year later in 1985, my personal favorite film of his. That film also featured Ringwald as the stereotypical high school ""princess.""10) I'm a guy. There aren't many female characters that I can personally relate to on film, but Samantha Baker was one character I personally identified with. I guess it was the whole thing about not being recognized on your birthday, feeling like nobody cares about you and you've been forgotten, and pining for the heart of someone that perhaps you know that deep down you can't have. I also felt somewhat of a connection to The Geek as well; I was The Geek in high school, but I wasn't a wannabe-ladies man, like Anthony Michael Hall's character was here. That's too bad, even though I did like his character and he got some of the funniest lines. I was his character in ""The Breakfast Club"" - the brain, plus a little bit of the rebel and the loner/weirdo. Try that on for size...11) But I guess that last part (about Samantha Baker, not The Geek) is negated by the fact that the guy, Jake Ryan, is interested in her the same way that she is interested in him. (I'm sure we've all been there before.)12) Even if the movie is a little rough around the edges - say, I don't know, the uncomfortable Asian stereotype of Long Duk Dong (Gedde Watanabe), which is perhaps an intentional swipe by the filmmakers at Hollywood racial stereotypes or not, I don't know - the enduring sweetness and identifiably real performance of Molly Ringwald in her star-making lead role at such a young age definitely makes this film a winner in my eyes.13) I'm really not sure how and why John Hughes just seemed to fade away from the Hollywood limelight at the end of the 1980s, but nonetheless his films have an enduring and lost-lasting appeal, sometimes 24, 25, years after the fact. He was able to cast top-of-the-line talent in most of his films; here, there's a small early role from John Cusack as one of The Geek's buddies, Bryce. As well, Cusack's sister Joan also appears in a small role as a fellow geek.14) We were all saddened by Hughes's passing last year, which incredibly enough was this film's 25th anniversary, and this year marks the 25th anniversary of ""The Breakfast Club.""15) ""Sixteen Candles"" is a great and funny debut from John Hughes. It showed great promise for a career that for some reason never really panned out the way that it should have. (Ironically, according to some sources, Hollywood is to blame for that.) Many feel that teen films have become incredibly typical and without Hughes's unique insight into the minds and lives of teenagers, the genre seems lost and nobody seems willing to give teens dignity, respect, and humanity anymore. He will be dearly missed.16) ""Sixteen Candles"" - 8/10",Sixteen Candles

34,drqshadow-reviews,"An Odd, Sometimes Awkward Combination of Sweet and Sour, With a Genuinely Hughes-Infused Beating Heart",7,11 July 2016,"Part sweet-hearted teenage romance and part raunchy National Lampoon comedy, which makes sense as this film represents a transition for first-time director John Hughes. Fresh from a post at the Lampoon magazine, where he penned the seminal classic Vacation, Hughes was about to revolutionize teen-geared filmmaking with his deep understanding of emotional roller coasters and accurate portrayal of the high school social structure. What results is a spotty picture that experiences triumphant highs and... well, not lows per se, but a shocking disconnect with any shred of political correctness. Long Duk Dong is the worst of these offenses, of course, as a blush-inducingly ugly Asian stereotype, while a major plot point in the second act involves handing off a passed-out prom queen for not-so-subtly hinted sexual escapades. At the time this was made, I'm sure, these seemed perfectly acceptable choices for a teen comedy, but it's impossible to imagine most of it surviving the filters today. But if we can forgive all that (or maybe just move on from it), Sixteen Candles remains an intrinsically charming (and often laugh-out-loud funny) film. Molly Ringwald is responsible for a great deal of that, at her blushing, grounded best, while Anthony Michael Hall deserves a nod for his work as her suave-as-he-thinks-he-is wannabe suitor. And I'd completely forgotten about several baby-faced cameos from John and Joan Cusack throughout the story. It spirals out of control at points, especially during the expansive, scattershot school dance, but regroups nicely in time for a touching, classically Hughsian finale.

Starring his muse Molly Ringwald and a host of now familiar faces, it has many of the things we would come to take for granted in the genre during the 80s and beyond. It doesn't quite click on the same level as 'The Breakfast Club' or 'Pretty In Pink', lacking the dramatic elements that helped to set them apart, but it sails by on the breezy charm of its cast and lighthearted story.Looking back, many have made a note of some of the film's un-pc elements, but honestly I found them to be a bit over-exaggerated. The film is filled with stereotypes, but it's only the ones surrounding Long Duk Dong that we're sensitive to looking through 2016 lenses. There are a few other instances that don't pass the PC test, but honestly, the film doesn't have a hateful bone in its entire body.Though I rank it near the bottom of Hughes' golden age, I still give 'Sixteen Candles' more than a passing grade.",Sixteen Candles
37,kirbylee70-599-526179,FOREVER YOUNG,9,6 June 2020,"It's hard to believe that the movie SIXTEEN CANDLES is now 36 years old. As a matter of fact most of those classic John Hughes films are around that age now. And yet in the minds of those who first saw them on the big screen years ago those characters, those actors, will always stay the same age forever. Thoughts of the antics and things that happened to them will be etched in our minds as well.Samantha ""Sam"" Baker (Molly Ringwald) wakes up to a world that has forgotten her, in particular her sweet sixteen birthday. It's easy to see why since her sister Ginny (Blanche Baker) is about to get married the next day. With grandparents coming and spending the night at their house and preparations needing to be met things are in turmoil at her house.In addition to this problem Sam is upset that her dream crush Jake (Michael Schoeffling) as far as she's concerned has no idea she exists. He's too busy with his girlfriend and the most popular girl in school Caroline (Haviland Morris). When Jake accidentally gets hold of a secret sex quiz being passed around and gets Sam's answers, he takes notice of her.On the bus ride home Sam is approached by geeky freshman Ted (Anthony Michael Hall). She pushes him away but he doesn't give up. When she gets home she finds more disappointment waiting as she finds her grandparents have adopted an exchange student named Long Duck Dong (Gedde Watanabe). Not only that, they insist she take him along with her to the school dance she's going to that night.Sam and Jake's paths never seem to cross but the same can't be said of her and Ted. Eventually the two of them have a heart to heart talk and Ted lets her know that Jake is interested in her. He asks her one small favor in return for helping her meet Jake: let him borrow her panties. Why? To prove to his friends the two of them were together. From the dance everyone heads to a party at Jakes house Caroline has invited them to.The party turns into a wild affair with kids tearing up the home of Jake's parents. It turns out Caroline invited more people than he expected. Disgusted with her, even more so since she spends the party drunk, Jake attempts to reach out to Sam not realizing she's there at the party. Will the pair finally meet up? Or will Sam and Jake both be left disappointed?The movie works on numerous levels. We have the story of a sister feeling forgotten in her older sibling's wake. Unappreciated for who and what she is. At least she feels that way from her point of view. We have the pining for someone who has no idea that we exist. But here again it's her perspective of that rather than reality. And we have the teen comedy filled with semi-naughty jokes and beer guzzling antics aplenty. All of these are brought together in a mix that Hughes was always able to handle well.None of this would work without a group of actors able to handle the task ahead of them. Ringwald was born to play these parts, the disillusioned young girl who felt she wasn't recognized or attractive enough for anyone but who was more than she realized. Hall is at his geeky best here, playing the part full on and over the top, just what it requires. Face it, these two are the center pieces of the film and the supporting casts around them only helps to bring off the whole.Hughes had a knack for understanding the minds and behaviors of teens in his films. At least the teens of those times. He captured their youthful enthusiasms, their angst, their desires, their beliefs and their goofiness. He did so with a lovingness that never made them look stupid or gross but human. That is an achievement that few directors have been able to do over the years. To do so in more than on movie is remarkable.While the movie has been out on disc before, it is now getting the Arrow Video treatment.

38,slokes,Crushes Can Be Fun,8,9 March 2012,"Molly Ringwald's starring debut makes for one of the 1980s' most distinctive cinematic moments, as Samantha Baker, middle daughter in a family who struggles with a forgotten birthday and a boy she's crazy about who, she thinks, doesn't know she exists.""You need four inches of bod and a great birthday,"" she tells herself, not knowing how great it could be.Before it can get great, however, Samantha will run a gauntlet that includes grandparents invading her bedroom (and feeling up her chest), an insulting brother, awkward stares at a teen dance, an embarrassing note winding up in the wrong hands, and a geek charging freshmen a dollar to see her underwear.Writer-director John Hughes launched his run of popular teen comedies with this high-energy charmer. Frankly, I found his later ""Brat Pack"" movies to be occasional fun done in by a mopey sense of teen entitlement, but ""Sixteen Candles"" shows how affecting a filmmaker he could be by focusing on the laughs and letting the drama and story take care of themselves.Hughes knew youth culture, and here plays up its kooky side for all it was worth. A senior party lays waste to the young hero's house. A bus ride turns into a geek-fest complete with a gazoo medley. ""There must be more dignified modes of transportation,"" Samantha whines.Anthony Michael Hall is the film's main scene-stealer as Farmer Ted, a squeaky-voiced freshman with eyes for Samantha even as she does all she can short of a macing to ward him off. Watching Ted dance with himself at the big dance, telling off his gang, and ogling Samantha as ""fully aged sophomore meat"" is something that never gets tired for me. It's also funny to see John Cusack as one of Ted's hangers-on, saying lines like ""to the max"" and ""take off"" without a hot tub in sight. (Cusack's sister Joan has a largely wordless role as a girl wearing an ungainly night brace wherever she goes.)Over time I've begun to really enjoy Gedde Watanabe as Long Duk Dong, the Asian kid who is staying with Samantha's grandparents and thus becomes another guest at her house. That is, until he meets an big-breasted Amazon who makes him a better offer. Out of control, he's the same kind of walking id John Belushi played in ""Animal House,"" swinging from doors and totaling Grandpa's car with careless glee. He's brought up a lot as a bad Hollywood stereotype, but he's really just another comic button Hughes keeps pushing in strategic moments, with Watanabe getting all and more out of lines like ""Now I have a place to put my hand!"" and ""Au-to-mo-bile!""The whole film has a wonderful lived-in look, with backgrounds that are constantly alive and often funny in their own right. Yes, the characters are all pretty much stereotypes, but they are also vividly played and presented. The jokes are not all clever or well-thought-out, but they keep flowing so freely that it's easy to miss the weaker ones unless you listen for them. Samantha comes across as cold and surly much of the time, but Ringwald makes the part work with her charisma and her way of selling the comedy of her character's predicament. Especially when she finds out about her underwear.The biggest weakness of the film is it starts off rather slow, establishing its story and characters in broad strokes with zero subtlety. But as the film goes along, it becomes something surprising for a teen comedy, a funnier and more involving experience that finds room to probe some deeper emotions. For all the funny lines, my favorite is the advice of Samantha's father: ""That's why they call them crushes. If they were easy, they'd call them something else.""Crushes aren't easy, but watching this one is.",Sixteen Candles
39,gcd70,Misfired teen comedy,4,18 January 2008,"Screen writer-director John Hughes has aimed his sights once again at the easily pleased young audiences, and it is surely the only target he is likely to strike with this rather misfired teen comedy.Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall, two Hughes regulars, star in this Cinderella story about a sixteen year old birthday girl whose parents have forgotten her special day because of her older sister's imminent wedding, and whose dream man doesn't even know she exists. And to make matters worse, poor little Sam Baker (Ringwald) is being vigorously pursued by the king of the school geeks (Hall). Unlike the dramatically sound 1985 hit ""The Breakfast Club"", both Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall fail to entertain whilst Hughes' flat and predictable script struggles to make us laugh, as it mostly resorts to tasteless or weak sex jokes and cheap shots. The funniest scene in fact would have to be at the church near the end of the film when Sammy's rather heavily sedated sister attempts to walk down the aisle with daddy.Otherwise ""Sixteen Candles"" is a disappointment from John Hughes and hardly a creditable teen flick.Saturday, August 20, 1994 - T.V.",Sixteen Candles
40,ptb-8,30 years ago...,8,28 March 2004,I am shocked to realise this hilarious film is now 30 years old! Films from 1964 seen in 1988 looked a zillion years apart.....how can a 1980s film like this one still be so new and play so fresh in 2014? ...Apart from it being funnier and truly inspired I really now appreciate more the legacy of John Hughes in his series of films that were released in that 5 year span 1984-89. Anthony Michael Hall is rightly celebrated and gorgeous Molly Ringwald deserves her fame in the teen hall of Stardom. Whatever happened to Michael Schoeffling (Jake)....anyone know? It seems incongruous that so many future stars got their start in this film yet he seemed to go nowhere. I am also very surprised it got a PG rating.......given the swearing and the nudity..but I guess in the spirit of it all it was a perfect pic for anyone 12 - 112. Very clever and very funny.,Sixteen Candles

42,vertigo_14,Because we've all been there once... (spoilers),9,25 August 2004,"Sixteen Candles is one of my favorite movies of all time, and one that I consider to be writer/director John Hughes greatest films for the very simple reason that it is the most sincere.We can all empathize with love struck Samantha Baker (Molly Ringwald), high school sophomore who secretly has a crush on popular high school senior, Jake Ryan (played by the handsome Michael Schoeffling, hubba hubba!). Jake, too, catches on after picking up an anonymous 'sex tester' in study hall that Samantha Baker dropped on the floor. The letter, which contains Jake's name as response to the question: 'if you could do it with one person, who would it be?' Though, Jake is currently dating self-absorbed party animal senior, Caroline Mumford, he is wondering whether Samantha Baker is really the ideal girl for him: 'someone that he can love, who will love him back.' We've all gone through this awkward teen love phase, especially in our high school years, and probably on more than one occasion. Finding yourself suddenly smitten with someone that maybe you've only confessed to your friends, but never directly to that one person, just in case they don't 'like like' you back. It's cute, innocent high school romance and makes for a genuinely sweet film. Contrast this, of course, to modern teen films that seem to do little more than stereotype teenagers as hormone raging misfits with little sincerity among their relationships, even those who eventually get together at the end. Hughes has a nice touch here, creating appreciable characters and plot.But, this is not all Hughes can do--his ability to create this youthful sincerity, probably much more than among characters in his later films like 'Weird Science' and 'Some Kind of Wonderful' (the Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink still raise to high ranks of greatness among 80s teen films in my book). But it is always played against supporting characters and subplots that leave us with some very memorable, outrageously funny scenes. We are not overswept and confined to the Samantha and Jake saga, which though the ultimate ends, may seem too ordinary to be important and thus, lack much of the entertainment quality if it were to be shown by itself. But, played against this background unforgettable supporting sequences such as that of the family forgetting Samanatha's birthday, of Samantha's obnoxious sister (Blanche Baker) preparing for the wedding with her 'oily variety bohunk', of foreign exchange student Long Duk Dong's (a cult favorite played by Gedde Watanabe) wild all-American teen experience, or of the trials and tribulations of the geek freshman (young Anthony Michael Hall) who consistently tries to pursue Samantha, we get not only a nice love story, but altogether, a great comedy. There are so many mini-adventures and misadventures that take place throughout the course of the one or two days that the story transpires that provide such an odd, but nonetheless funny, concoction of characters that in one way or another lead up to the finale meeting of Samantha and Jake. Though sticking with traditional Hughes elements such as the setting of Illinios suburbs, of not-too-intuitive parents, and other commonalities, Hughes doens't get as overtly political as he does with his other films like the Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, and even the comedy, Career Opportunties (written by Hughes, directed by Bryan Gordon). This is just a feel good teen movie with enough going on to keep you entertained from beginning to end. I always smile when I see Samantha and Jake meeting at the end on the steps of the wedding chapel and in the finale as the two are sitting on the table, Samantha in her brides maid's dress near the cake and Jake saying to her 'make a wish Samantha,' and she responds, 'it already came true.' What can I say, I'm a sucker for that. How romantic.Happy Birthday, Samanatha.",Sixteen Candles
43,triple8,The movie that made molly ringwald,6,20 February 2004,"I doubt there are to many fans of 80's teen movies who have seen this and disliked it. I am one of the many who agrees this was one fine addition to the genre. The movie was so sweet and tender how could you not melt a little? However while I moderately liked it and understand why it was a classic I wouldn't put it in the ""top 5"" of teen movies ever-though its up there for many. In fact though many, if not most, will widely disagree with me I liked pretty in pink a wee bit better. Still I have nothing negative to say about sixteen candles. The reason its not in my top 5 is because a few scenes and characters were just to obnoxious. My favorite teen movies include ""Fast times"",""breakfast club"", ""some kind of wonderful"" and ""clerks"" to name a few. But I still think as far as warm sentimental unoffensive teen comedies go sixteen candles is right up there.

44,Sandcooler,Birth of the Brat Pack (sorta)!,8,8 March 2014,"John Hughes is one of those writer/directors that make naive people believe making movies is simple. There's really not a lot to ""Sixteen Candles"". It's a very simple story with very simple characters, but as usual with Hughes it's all in the execution. The dialogues in ""Sixteen Candles"" are just marvelously written, the character's traits are fully established within minutes and it all comes so naturally. Anthony Michael Hall's Geek (actual character name) might be the most perfectly build-up character in Hughes' entire filmography, never have I been so happy for a guy this creepy. Occasionally though, I got to say things get somewhat weird with the various ""likeable"" characters. For instance, the perfect boy of our main character's dreams is someone who tries to hook up with her while passing his current girlfriend (who for good measure is unconscious and drunk) to a 15-year-old who he forces to drive a car. Wow, get him while he's available ladies! But hell, this movie has such a sweet atmosphere and somewhere in there I heard the happy ending music so let's not nitpick. In the same category: the Chinese character might be the worst racial stereotype since Andy Rooney in ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"", but I dare you to see the ""YES, MARRIED!""-scene and not laugh. You leave this movie with a great feeling, and that seems to be what they were going for.P.S: Also check out a very young John Cusack is his last role that wasn't an author.

This film has themes about coping with the subject of sex, shyness and inexperience, and true love.
The story is fresh and cheerful and occasionally amusing with a goofy sense of humour. The script is sharp, with a keen sense for the idiom of teenspeak. As ever, Molly Ringwald is natural and appealing in this coming-of-age drama about a bright-eyed girl turning 16. It has a funny performance from Anthony Michael Hall as the dork, and a handsome turn from Michael Schoeffling.

48,bobsgrock,A few hilarious scenes make up for the uneven story.,7,15 April 2009,"Not that you should expect an artistic masterpiece when watching a John Hughes film, but you can expect to hear some very quotable dialog as well as themes involving high school drama, crushes and trying to be cool. With this simple-minded story about a girl turning sixteen, Hughes creates a reality that is not reality but seems like it to some teenagers, perhaps even today. Molly Ringwald established herself as a teen star of the 80s with this role as Samantha Baker, who dreams of having the best sweet sixteen birthday. Of course, nothing goes right with her family forgetting and the love of her high school life seemingly ignoring her. The kicker is the school geek is relentlessly hitting on her and she seems to have lost any decency in the high school society.John Hughes always made films that had a distinct audience following, so it isn't a stretch for some people not to like this movie. Nevertheless, if you have been in high school not too long before like I have, you still can remember some of things he discusses here and relate to these characters. And there are some wild characters here, not including a foreign student named Long Duck Dong, the beautiful senior Caroline, and of course, the Geek Ted. The acting is very good with Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall perfectly capturing the feeling of angst and hopelessness we all get when we are pressured into being a certain way. There are some major flaws here, including the subplot with the foreign student, as well as the portrayal of the family Sam's sister is marrying into. Nevertheless, Hall makes up for it with his hilarious turn as the Geek who is cool to his associates but he knows differently. And on top is Ringwald, sweet, pretty and totally in control of her character. Certainly one of Hughes' best works, it is still considered a classic of the 1980's teen genre and established what would become Hughes' next film and perhaps masterpiece: The Breakfast Club.",Sixteen Candles
49,Karl Self,Where'd you learn that stuff? -- School ... -- Good!,8,29 November 2009,"John Hughes -- RIP -- had the knack for capturing the essence of teendom on film, without pandering to his audience or becoming condescending. 16 Candles, Hughes' firstling, is a prime example of his art, and one that's still entertaining a quarter of a century (sigh!) later. The movie starts on the morning of Samantha Baker (Molly Ringwald) 's sweet sixteenth birthday, which is sadly, dramatically forgotten by her entire family because her elder sister's marriage is imminent. To make things worse, Sammy is being ignored by her highschool heartthrob, but pursued by a budding nerd who wants to get into her pants -- or rather, AT her pants. After a hughe (sic!) roller-coaster ride of a plot, everything eventually comes right, Samantha gets her guy and, and sexual prospects are in the offing even for the nerd (Anthony Michael Hall). Great acting by Hall and heroine Molly Ringwald, who was actually 16 years old at the time -- while some of her peers in the movie are already in their mid-twenties. What somewhat dates this otherwise surprisingly fresh movie are two facts:*a large part of the story revolves around a prize in the form of a packet of floppy disks, which were apparently prized possessions in 1984 (I don't actually remember them ever having been that expensive), but which have long become obsolete since then*what really made me suffer though are some of the movie's ""sexual politics"": it clearly suggests that it's OK to have sexual intercourse with a girl while she's asleep; the same girl is later put in a ""compromising"" situation with another boy while she's passed out, so that her boyfriend can get rid of her for sleeping around; and various other plot elements, which seem to stem straight from the 1950ies",Sixteen Candles
50,sharky_55,I've never bagged a babe. I'm not a stud.,5,21 July 2016,"It is a John Hughes teen movie, so even during the opening scenes many will have sketched a good idea of how Sixteen Candles will conclude. The usual archetypes are all there; the prissy older sister, the bratty, fast talking younger brother, the mopey middle child, the high school power couple and so on. Hughes would build a career from these - in fact he subscribes to these roles so much that he would later cast Hall in practically the exact same role a year later in Breakfast Club, as the brain, or, as he is constantly referred to here, the geek. The two would have the climatic scene in the car, where they realise they are more than their labels. Conventionally we expect that they will somehow end up together romantically after Jake is found to be less than the noble pretty boy; you know, the whole 'what you were looking for was right beneath your eyes' shtick. But Hughes doesn't fully commit to these expectations, but flips them around, winking slightly. The father is not stuffy or stuck up, and remarks that it is good that his son is being educated in the areas of female sexuality, albeit crudely. The whole film seems to conspire against Sam, with even the grandparents forgetting her birthday. She shows a sarcastic awareness: ""They live for that sh*t!"".So there is decent groundwork. Hughes sprinkles these little knowing touches, which are familiar and make sense; the sex quizzes that teenagers pass around, still all the rage these days, and in the way that two jocks can only hold an even slightly in-depth conversation whilst alternating on the pull-up bar. Even the geeks, the lowest of the low on the proverbial food chain, make crude sexual wagers amongst themselves. Sexuality for them is a strange, scary and curious thing, and Sam's laughter is a gentle mockery of sorts, transcending the boundaries of the screen. The audience too can giggle at how inexperienced they are, and how they are completely ruled by these expectations of them. But we also understand, and sympathise, which is what Hughes is known for. The secondary character, however, are a different story. The queen bee is predictable enough, a blonde bombshell that holds the star quarterback type in her claws and smiles sweetly to the rest of the world. But the mistake is to afford Jake the exact same personality. He knows nothing of Sam except for a little note she wrote in, and the phone-calls to her grandfather, whilst humorous, ultimately just confirm our suspicions that this power couple is exactly as they appear: shallow as a kiddy pool, in both characterisation and attitude. So no one cares when they break-up amicably. The worst of the film is easily the Asian exchange student, Long Duk Dong, whose every word is followed by a loud and distracting gong, and whose broken English, hideous haircut and lack of social etiquette immediately brands him as the designated punching bag. This is not only lazy stereotyping (yelling ""Banzai"" as he falls from a tree, the way he flits from Chinese to Japanese) but also Hughes contradicting his own mantra. Characters are more than their labels, except when you need to make vulgar, derogatory jokes. Dong is immediately shackled with another similar stereotype, the large, unattractive man-beast. The act is supposed to be eye-opening and subversive but only reinforces the respective stigmas. Even Hall, lowly as he is, barely gives neck- brace girl a second thought. There's something very mean-spirited about the whole thing.",Sixteen Candles
51,Beta_Gallinger,"John Hughes made better films than this in his career, but this one still has enough to make most of it work",7,3 November 2010,"I was born in the 80's, so I obviously didn't get to see any of the teen movies of that decade when they were new. ""Sixteen Candles"" is one of those films, and I finally watched it over 25 years after its release, knowing it was from John Hughes, who made several of these 80's teen movies, including ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", both of which I had seen and thought were good. I also knew that the cast of this directorial debut from Hughes included Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall, who would both appear in ""The Breakfast Club"" shortly after this. When I finally watched this 1984 romantic comedy, I didn't think it was as good as the other two teen films from Hughes which I had seen, but it still has its charm.It's Samantha Baker's sixteenth birthday, but her family is so distracted by the wedding of her older sister, Ginny, which is coming up the next day, they forget all about Samantha's birthday! When the hapless high school student wakes up that morning, it is soon clear that nobody else in the family has remembered the occasion, as nobody mentions it before she goes to school that day, and everybody in the household talks to her as if it's just another day. Obviously upset about this, Samantha then goes to school, and unfortunately, life isn't treating her too kindly here, either. She has a crush on an older student named Jake Ryan, but does not seem to have much of a chance with him. This is not helped by the fact that another boy in the school has a crush on her, and he happens to be a geeky freshman who really gets on her nerves! Worse still, it seems Samantha is headed for further trouble at home! At first, when I started watching this particular John Hughes effort, I wasn't sure exactly what I thought yet. At this point, there are some mildly amusing scenes showing some dysfunction in the Baker family, but I didn't know if anything in the film would make me laugh very hard. The part where Samantha takes a sex quiz in class is pretty funny, though it certainly isn't hilarious. Another memorably funny scene is Samantha's first conversation with ""The Geek"" (Anthony Michael Hall's character), especially when he asks her if he's turning her on, when he should know the answer! This might be funnier than any gag that comes before it. The ""Geek"" character contributes a good amount of humour to the film, and another memorably funny scene is him trying to dance with Samantha. There were parts of ""Sixteen Candles"" which I didn't really care for, as it isn't always entertaining watching Samantha having her constant bad luck and getting all sulky, and I wasn't sure how funny I thought the main character's grandmother ""feeling her up"" was. However, for the most part, this is somehow an intriguing movie with memorable conversation scenes. It has some funny moments and also some pretty good serious ones, even if they're not super-touching.Apparently, this ""Brat Pack"" film was originally rated R, but the rating was then changed to PG on appeal. There's some strong profanity at times in this film (not just MILD language), and even a scene showing the Caroline Mulford character in the shower, in which we are shown a close-up shot of her breasts and then a view from the side which reveals her buttocks! I believe this is the most explicit PG-rated movie I've ever seen, and if it had been released just a little while later than it was, I'm sure it would have at least been given a PG-13 rating, though I'm sure many wouldn't even consider that to be enough, due to that shower scene! So, even though many PG-rated movies are family ones, ""Sixteen Candles"" obviously isn't. This 1984 romantic teen comedy is not for kids, but for teenagers and adults who can take some swearing (including the f-bomb, which isn't used much in this film, but isn't completely avoided) and one scene of graphic nudity, it could be worth watching if you like this kind of film.",Sixteen Candles
52,TOMASBBloodhound,A difficult kiss.,9,26 February 2006,"The final shot of this film can in some ways mirror the difficulties of adolescence. We see Molly Ringwald finally getting to kiss the boy she's been after since the film's outset. However this kiss doesn't look like it would have been particularly easy for the actors to pull off. Both Ringwald and Shoeffling are sitting ""Indian-style"" on a tabletop facing one another. They both have to lean forward presumably using their wrists for leverage while their lips meet over the flaming candles on her birthday cake. A difficult kiss, indeed.Sixteen Candles is one of the best films John Hughes gave us in the 1980s. The young cast full of so many extraordinary talents gives us one memorable scene after another. Anthony Michael Hall is particularly effective as the leader of the nerdiest students on campus. Listen to his voice crack as he reads many of his lines, and try not to laugh. Good luck! The plot, as many of us know, centers around a young girl (Ringwald) whose parents forget about her sixteenth birthday in the midst of the chaos surrounding her older sister's wedding. At the same time she tries to win the affection of the most popular guy in school who happens to be dating the most beautiful girl in school. Ah, the trials and tribulations of high school.The film is well-paced, never drags, and has its characters pegged pretty well. The obnoxious grandparents are particularly well-drawn.

53,The_Movie_Cat,An odd mix of overearnest and bawdy,5,4 January 2014,"I caught up with this John Hughes movie after reading that it was a direct influence on his later Pretty In Pink, and also is more highly regarded.It's something of a surprise, given that the comedic elements here are broad and garish, and the emotional elements are really without payoff. This is the world of the 80s, where drink driving, taking advantage of drunk girls and racial stereotypes are all just everyday occurrences. (Of the latter I can't complain too much as Gedde Watanabe does seem to be genuinely enjoying himself, bless him).Having just rewatched Pretty In Pink (and rated it a perhaps overgenerous 8) I was astounded that it not only stands up as a guilty pleasure, but a genuinely decent movie. You may have small niggles, like Andrew McCarthy's eyes continually opening so wide it looks like he's having an aneurysm, or wondering how you ever thought Duckie was straight, but it's a well constructed film with emotional pay-offs.Sixteen Candles, in contrast, has only shallow thrills. There's no real reward with the relationship between Ringwald and Schoeffling as they don't even speak until the end of the movie, and their dialogue consists of trite lines like ""Make a wish."" ""It already came true"". Away from the stilted romance, and Anthony Michael Hall as unlikely friend/borderline sex pest, we get comedy sound effects to cement the overplayed comedy elements, such as a Chinese cymbal noise every time anyone talks about Long Duk Dong(!)This isn't a bad movie. In many ways, it's quite a good one. But it features two disparate elements that don't gel together all that well: while I can see how it went on to be vastly improved in the guise of Pretty In Pink, the other 50% of the movie went on to be Weird Science. Not that Weird Science is a terrible picture, but it's a diametrically opposed one, and this - complete with a topless scene and a blowjob reference - jars badly with the core subject matter.John Hughes was just in his early 30s when he made this, his sixth movie but the first he directed. The follow-up, The Breakfast Club, went for overreaching earnestness, and I received many a heated private message when I criticised it in a 2001 review. But fast-forward two years and you get the run of Pretty in Pink/Ferris Bueller's Day Off/Some Kind of Wonderful, three solid movies that deserve to be revisited. John Hughes was able to tap into teen concerns and was known as one of the masters of the coming of age movie... he just needed to come of age himself.",Sixteen Candles
54,gab-14712,"A Sweet, Mature Teen Comedy!",8,20 April 2020,"Director John Hughes just might be the unsung hero of 80's cinema. He gave us many teen films that have a unique style. His films are hilarious, fresh, and often relatable. Teen comedies generally loathe their characters, but Hughes treat his characters with respect and compassion. After all, they are only merely human. Aren't we all? Hughes had many teen comedy hits this decade and one of them is 1984's Sixteen Candles.Hughes truly understand the dynamics of high-school life. Sex is on everyone's mind, but they are so inexperienced, and it becomes a big deal. There were cliques in every high school as the whole geek vs. hot girl plot confirms. While this movie has some focus there, it elevates that cliché. There is this one scene where these two characters are in the front seat of an automobile. After Molly Ringwald's character tells the geek to get lost, they both realize that they feel the same; insecure, lost, and afraid. These characters would lift each other up in terms of friendship. My readers, that is the power of John Hughes. The ability to turn worn-down clichés and turn them into something new.It is Samantha Baker's (Molly Ringwald) sweet sixteen! There is a problem. Her family forgot her birthday thanks to the hubbub surrounding her elder sister's wedding. With the family forgetting all about her, Samantha has other teenage problems in her life. She has the biggest crush on the hottest man in her senior class, Jake (Michael Schoeffling) who happens to be dating the hottest girl in the school. Meanwhile, Ted the Geek (Anthony Michael Hall) is a freshman who has an enormous crush on her and will go out of his way just to hold her panties. With the wedding only mere hours away, will Samantha finally get the love of her life? Will her family give pause to remember her birthday?The performances are simple and sweet. Watching them bring their humane characters to life are something else. Molly Ringwald is the perfect casting choice. She elevated her role and then some. I really could relate to Anthony Michael Hall. I may not have been the sex-crazed complete geek as his character, but there were similarities and I thought Hall was impressive. He played his character like it was a real human being. The supporting cast has some solid performances from future big-name stars like John Cusack, Joan Cusack, and Jami Gertz. I also liked Paul Dooley who played Sam's father.Thankfully, the majority of the plot focused on the personal life of Samantha Baker. There are some problematic issues that brought down my score for the film. At best, some of the jokes are outdated. Some people thought there is a hint of racism in the form of Long Duk Dong, the foreign exchange student who loves to party. There are some impressively unfunny jokes regarding the racial stereotype. Not all of them, but many of them. Gedde Watanabe does give his best to the role though.I may have graduated high school 26 years after this film was released, but the themes of life during high school remain constant. Hughes captured it with his direction and his screenplay in a sweet, funny way. I was laughing so hard during the scene where Hall's character uses Samantha's panties to earn some cash from other nerdy boys in the men's locker room. Ah, the life of people who find it hard to get themselves a girl! Been there, felt that!Sixteen Candles is mostly a sweet movie about finding love and your place in the world. Unlike other teen comedies of the era, this movie has a more mature face tackling these issues. Of course, being the 80's, expect a killer soundtrack...and those crazy house parties! Cannot forget about those! Thanks to the combined efforts of John Hughes and Molly Ringwald, this film is a winner even if there are some minor issues.My Grade: B+",Sixteen Candles

56,itamarscomix,Still works,7,4 November 2012,"A lot can be said about John Hughes's directorial debut, but subtle and sophisticated it isn't. Hughes employs every cliché and every stereotype in the teen-comedy rulebook to full effect, from the nerds with braces referencing Star Trek to the silly and out-of-touch foreigner to the masculine but sensitive jock falling in love with the unpopular, ""plain"" girl (played by Molly Ringwald, mind you), including some very un-PC gong sounds whenever said foreigner is on screen and even one blatant 'Gilligan's Island' cut, complete with sound effect. Hughes uses, in a completely straightforward way, the very same stereotypes and prototypes that he'll dissect and deconstruct only one year later in his second feature and his landmark work, The Breakfast Club, but for now there's no subtext and no substance.And yet, somehow, it all works. MollY Ringwald is charismatic enough to make her completely unbelievable character believable, and the film's pacing is near perfect and makes sure that you never stop to think about it for too long. And the humor, shallow and predictable though it is, is often pretty funny. Sixteen Candles also strikes a solid balance in its sexual humor, handling it pretty liberally and earnestly but not excessively like 'Porky's' and other such sex comedies. It's, on the whole, a comedy that still works, is still funny and pretty constantly entertaining. It's not a masterpiece, but that's more than could be said for the large majority of comedies I've seen since Hughes's time.",Sixteen Candles
57,jem132,Sweet film about turning 16,8,1 June 2009,"Back to 80's teen movies again! While this pre-cursor to the classic ""The Breakfast Club"" isn't quite as good, director John Hughes hits the mark again in giving us a fun microcosm of high school life, with punchy dialogue. Sweet redhead Molly Ringwald has just turned sweet 16, but her family has been busy with her vacuous older sister's wedding. Samantha's birthday really sucks, but the guy of her dreams Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling) may have noticed her after all. A relative to 90's teen gross-out comedies such as ""American Pie"", John Hughes' comedies are better because he doesn't rely on gratuitous nudity to get laughs. However, there is something very off-putting about Jake practically inviting Farmer Ted (Anthony Michael Hall, who played the geek so well) to sexually assault his girlfriend. And the laughs with the (now) obligatory minor Asian character get tired after a while. Watch out for John and Joan Cusack in bit roles.",Sixteen Candles
58,Min111,A sweet sixteen,10,4 January 2021,"The movie, in some ways, is similar to ""The Breakfast Club"" which came out the following year. I use to thought ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Sixteen Candles"" were related. Molly and Anthony were in both the movies, so it shouldn't be surprising why people think the movies are similar. I think they got the roles to play the characters in ""The Breakfast Club"" because of their performances in ""Sixteen Candles"" a year earlier. Anyway ""Sixteen Candles"" is a good movie. It's about a girl named Samantha Baker. It's her sixteenth birthday, but it's not a birthday she was hoping to be; in fact, the rest of her family has forgotten about her birthday. What's worse is that Samantha's sister, Ginny Baker, is getting married the next day. It's kind of understandable why the family has forgotten about her birthday, but Samantha thinks otherwise. A sixteenth birthday is suppose to be special. She suffers from every possible embarrassment on her sixteenth birthday. She has a crush on a boy named Jake, but he has no idea how she feels. Another popular character is called Ted who happens to be a geek. He has a crush on Samantha, but she rejects him anyway. I actually wanted to see Samantha and Ted as a couple rather than Jake and Samantha. I think a lot of people wanted that. ""Sixteen Candles"" would've been better if Samantha and Ted were in a relationship. Ted is a good-looking guy. Ted is a sweet guy. I can't understand why Samantha wouldn't be interested in him. I don't like Jake by the way. Ted would've made a better partner for Samantha than Jake who was already dating someone. That was the only thing I disagreed with otherwise the movie was excellent. Anyway, ""Sixteen Candles"" is a comedy and romantic movie. I guess you can say it's one of these ""sweet"" movies to have come out from the eighties. I'm glad I've seen it. Will you see it?",Sixteen Candles
59,cardsrock,A classic 80s teen movie,7,20 October 2019,"While this John Hughes teen romance film hasn't aged terribly well, it is still chocked full of iconic scenes. The humor is pretty strong and the actors are perfectly cast in their roles. There are some iffy scenes that, while regarded as okay at the time, are pretty cringey to watch today. Sixteen Candles is still an iconic film from the time of peak 80s teen romance movies.",Sixteen Candles
60,CinematicInceptions,"Entertaining, but not Hughes' best.",7,13 May 2016,"Of the John Hughes films I've seen, this is probably the worst. It tries to have some slightly deep messages like Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and Planes Trains and Automobiles, but kind of falls short. It was entertaining much of the time, but some of the more off color stuff like the gags involving Long Duk Dong failed to be amusing. As they go, John Hughes is great when it comes to making off color jokes that don't completely turn off certain audience members, but I guess he was still working on it at this point.The story centers around a character that deserves sympathy, but complains a lot about it. Not that she doesn't deserve to complain, but it just makes her a little less likable as a character. Certainly it's an accurate portrayal of sixteen year old girls with Sam's polarized emotions and evident insecurity about her appearance. In some ways, this makes Jake Dyer a less realistic character. I think the point of his character was to show that it's okay for teenage guys to have a heart. However, this results in the story becoming something like the inverse of the cliché where the loser guy ends up with the dream girl (examples include but are not limited to Spiderman, Transformers, Alladin). It's an unfortunate thing, but I do not see any real-life 18 year old's making the same decision that Jake does. I suppose this accounts for the presence of the Geek/Farmer Ted, who I'm sure more of the male presence in the audience relate to.The plot has more layers to it than the usual comedy, but is not at all hard to follow. What is a little surprising is how passive Samantha is in context of the plot. After all, she doesn't go to Jake's party, which is a pretty big part of the story. I can't think of one thing she does to motivate the eventual concluding scene. I suppose her one quality that makes her deserve the rewards of her suffering is her honesty. She's not that shy about her feelings for Jake, but never acts on them exactly.Despite some of its other flaws, it is consistently amusing with jokes surrounding the Geek, Samantha's dysfunctional family, Joan and John Cusaks' characters, and the general awkwardness of being in high school. It has a similar feel to Breakfast Club because of the actors, but the comedy is much more situational here, whereas it's more verbal in Breakfast Club. There are some classic lines in Sixteen Candles too, but not that many.If you like John Hughes or the Brat Pack, this should satisfy, though it's not his or their best. Don't let the PG rating fool you into thinking it's a family-friendly movie, especially if Ferris Bueller does not fit that standard either. By modern ratings, it would be a fairly high PG-13. Also I'll warn you that it does not take place over one day. I was expecting this and it kind of worsened the experience. Finally, I will add that the portrayal of Long Duk Dong could easily come off as offensive to the Chinese exchange student stereotype. But if none of that deters you, give it a shot. Overall Rating: 7.6/10.",Sixteen Candles
61,DavidSim240183,John Hughes' bouncy teen debut,9,22 December 2007,"""Chronologically you're 16 today. Physically you're still 15.""Samantha Baker's opening line bemoaning her breast size. And that one dry observation is just the beginning of Samantha's hellish 16th birthday in Sixteen Candles, the debut feature from that king of the teen movies John Hughes.Sixteen Candles is very special for the simple reason that John Hughes showed other filmmakers of the day what a teen movie could be all about. Instead of an orgy of sex, booze and all night partying, films starring teenagers could be about real people. Young people with problems of their own. Fears. Insecurities. And a healthy dollop of angst.Sixteen Candles takes all of those qualities and makes a surprisingly fun film out of it. Even at the start of his career, John Hughes has made a film that's buoyant, brimming with confidence and delightfully dotty. Its everything a teen film should be.The film that put Molly Ringwald on the map shows off her budding talent. She really is quite wonderful in the role of Samantha because she must encapsulate a lot of emotions. Especially when the emotions of those around her are particularly running high.Even though its Samantha's birthday, her family are much more preoccupied with her elder sister Ginny's wedding. They completely forget that its her birthday. If that weren't bad enough, Samantha's high school crush Jake doesn't even know she exists, she's being hounded by ""The Geek"" (a sex-starved Anthony Michael Hall), she's been lumbered with a Chinese foreign exchange student, and there's a party to go to.Sixteen Candles is quite a breezy film. Its a very confident debut for John Hughes. There are touches that would become hallmarks for Hughes. Carefully etched characters. His ear for teenspeak. And quirkiness. Hughes is known for having a certain quirky touch but in Sixteen Candles it really goes into overdrive. And that may be the film's only fault.Yes its a very funny film to be sure. But sometimes it feels like Hughes is more interested in springing the next oddball quirk on us than getting on and telling the story. The film is downright crazy at times. TV themes on the soundtrack (if well employed). Surreal images. There were times when these little curiosities quite wore me out. Every scene has something odd about it. Except one. The scene where Samantha's father Jim (Paul Dooley) sits her down and apologises for missing out on what may have been the most important birthday in Samantha's life. Its the one scene in the whole film where Hughes forgets about being nutty and concentrates on the characters themselves. Hughes is always at his best when he directs his own scripts, and this scene in particular really shines.Jim and Samantha actually feel like a real father and daughter. He doesn't quite connect on her level, but he senses her problems and offers to be a sympathetic ear, if not a solution to them. A wonderful scene brilliantly written and performed to perfection by Dooley and Ringwald.There is an actual plot going on throughout all the wackiness Hughes has let loose. And Ringwald is at the centre of it. This may in fact be her best performance. Not only because it feels like her truest film character, but she is exactly the same age as Samantha. 16. And that's why Ringwald so completely identifies with Samantha so perfectly.The film also has a very appealing list of co-stars around the edges of the story. At the head of the line is Anthony Michael Hall, suitably geekish without actually looking like a geek. At least he doesn't wear the thick glasses and lots of zits that crop up in many a teen movie's list of stereotypes.Hall wants to nail Samantha, the girl of his dreams so he can score points with all his geek pals. But in a surprisingly sweet scene, the two open up to each other instead. Its a moment where Hughes changes tack, and their relationship rotates from testy to understanding. Samantha confides in Hall her problems and being unlucky in love, and ""The Geek"" quite surprisingly offers to help out in a way that doesn't feel contrived at all. There are lots of neat little cameos from a few early risers. Look out for brother and sister John & Joan Cusack. John forms a part of the ""Geek Trio"", and although Joan walks through the film sporting an unsightly neck brace, she shows her considerable talent for physical comedy without having to do much of anything. Just the sight of her in that thing is worth the price of admission alone!Kramer vs Kramer star Justin Henry is perfectly horrid as Samantha's brattish brother Mike. Haviland Morris is perfectly bitchy as Jake's Prom Queen girlfriend Caroline, and Gedde Watanabe perfectly wacky as Long Duk Dong, the Chinese exchange student. His antics may seem offensive to some nitpickers, but since he looks like he's having so much fun, who cares?Michael Schoeffling is a bit on the bland side as Jake, but the way he and Samantha come together is still quite nice. John Hughes would continue to improve in the teen genre with greater and greater hits. But the sight gags, witty performances and sharp dialogue ensure Sixteen Candles will always remain a classic.",Sixteen Candles

Otherwise, the acting is strictly kiddy stuff, with adults ridiculed in one way or another, and the script a mixed bag of interesting and plain irrelevant developments - but, looking back, that's youth amounts to.Good to revisit this 1980s capsule, before mobile phones and the Internet turned youngsters into distant, distracted and technological beings, apparently a new step in human evolution.",Sixteen Candles
63,jayjaycee,Regular scent mixed with an insipid odour,7,20 September 2020,"""Sixteen Candles"" is a 1984 romantic comedy directed by John Hughes starring Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall.
⚪
All in all, this iconic teen movie might appear to be a regular scented candle that sprays nothing but the bland odour of genre typical clichés and stereotypes, but considering that it is the Hughes classic all films that came afterwards a modelled after, it must be considered as the original, outstanding fragrance that only appears dull to us, because we smelled it several times before, nevertheless, it burns down extremely unevenly at times and illuminates the shenanigans of irrelevant side characters when it should have focussed its warm light on Ringwald's genuinely radiant and lovely Samantha and burns itself on some aspects that are downright outdated, thus making it an enjoyable yet not quite outstanding entry to the oeuvre of the legendary eighties film maker that knows to understand the youth like no other, for me being more than that though, it simply lacks the sensitivity and appropriate seriousness required in a film dealing with the delicate things of the life of a teenage girl. After a necessary two week hiatus from watching and reviewing films (due to a sensory overload), I finally felt like returning to the regular business and resuming the hobby that makes me who I am in the first place. As much as I enjoyed my fourteen-day absence, I still got to admit that I missed it a lot deep down inside of me. So, I thought ""What is the best movie to watch for staging my comeback?"" and immediately had John Hughes' directorial debut in mind. At the end of August, I was fortunately able to get a hold the mediabook edition that was recently released in Germany, and that is why I had to give it a watch as soon as possible. Well, as you can see, the day of my return has come and I had a great time with this film, even if it isn't quite as masterful as I expected it from a film both written and directed by the genius behind ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"". You can only see his brilliance here and there, still a little rough around the edges, and yet you can surmise what he will be capable of doing in the future. His distinct ability to create relatable, lifelike and most importantly, vulnerable characters shows itself in the case of protagonist birthday girl Samantha Baker whose special day couldn't have been any more worse. She is the identification figure of the contemporary youth, and embodies all the struggles, fears and insecurities of a girl of her age. As it is a common aspect in the films of Hughes, the parents are the ""antagonistic"" force for the protagonist, and in the case of this film, the siblings as well. For Sam, turning sixteen is more than just a regular occasion, quite the contrary, it is of an indescribable importance to her. For her family? Well, they didn't even remember her special day and rather focus on the upcoming wedding of her older sister Ginny. On the first look, it might appear insignificant to some viewers, but this small aspect proves the director's remarkable talent to highlight as well as understand the problems of teenagers that mostly are not taken seriously. The same applies to the character of ""The Geek"" perfectly annoyingly portrayed by Anthony Michael Hall who represents the whole ""prestige and reputation"" problem many teenagers suffer from as well. To him, being respected and well-esteemed in front of his ""friends"" is of more worth than being true to himself, hence he acts like a total jerk at times. In terms of superbly balanced and splendidly relatable characters this flick is as marvellous as other films from the writer-director, but there are still some undeniable flaws that prevent it from raking on the same level. What is it, though? Well, first of all, it suffers from some questionable plot holes and illogical decisions. It is not even a problem in the first place that it obviously draws on high school movie cliches and stereotypes, I am even sure that Hughes somehow invented them or shaped them as we know them today, it is just that many actions and scenes are ridiculously unrealistic. It can be argued that it is possible that a whole family forgets about an important birthday of a member, but the whole thing with Jake Ryan made me frown multiple times. He is a popular senior, moreover the boyfriend of the prom queen herself and didn't seem to be unhappy at all with his situation. So why does he question his complete social status after finding a scrip that was never supposed to meet his eyes? All suddenly, he chases after a younger girl that he supposed has a crush on him and throws away everything he has had before. Even if he, in a discussion with Ted, admits that he wants more than what he has had previously, I still don't believe him at all. May it be that his character is painfully underdeveloped and has no personality at all or that the actor playing him has only one facial expression and literally as much acting talent as an insipid piece of cake, it doesn't chance the fact that it appears utterly forced. In direct comparison to Ringwald and Hall who both deliver great (before they met at detention at Shermer High School) he appears entirely out of place. Aside from that, many other aspects haven't aged either. Next to the distasteful caricature of an Asian man whose name bares an unpleasant resemblance with a duck's member (and who is probably the most insulting depiction of an Asian next to Mickey Rooney's infamous and equally disgusting portrayal of Mr. Yunioshi in ""Breakfast At Tiffany's""), it furthermore displays a nasty habit of objectifying women and reducing them to their sexual features. When one character charges money for showing a girl's underwear to a bunch of pubescent teenage boys (after forcing himself on her several times, by the way) or when a senior tells an underaged boy who acted like a total creep before to ""do whatever"" to his reeling drunk and absent-minded girlfriend, I couldn't help but feeling a shiver running down my spine. Moreover, it had some focus issues, especially in the third act, that made the experience a lot less enjoyable. Too many scenes concentrate on the excessive partying and on the whereabouts of irrelevant side characters so that the protagonist, namely Samantha, is pushed in the background and forgotten about, even though the film suggested in the beginning to not do this what every other characters did to her. More importantly, it too often tried to be extremely funny where a little more decency would have been fitting. Whenever it was about to reach the required level of seriousness, Hughes always added an unnecessary joke and desperately tried to keep it on the comedy level when extreme sensitivity was the only thing appropriate in the scene, thus it prevents the characters from unfolding their full personalities and blocks character development. Imagine if it had displayed more earnestness! Ringwald, who already delivers wonderfully and defines the cult status of this film with her genuine charm, would have been even more wonderful. In the end, it is obvious that Hughes still had yet to learn about focus and tone, but still I cannot say that I did not feel the iconic magic of the director. It is there, but only not fully developed yet. A little more sensitive, a little less silly and modest and it would have been a masterpiece. Like this? A decent directorial debut of which the final scene was still extremely touching to me (and one of the few titles that actually managed to cast actors the same age as the characters they are playing). Cinematic history and the initiation of cultural phenomenon still relevant as of today, sadly shadowed by outdated views.",Sixteen Candles
64,jcbutthead86,"An Excellent,Hilarious Classic Teen Comedy From John Hughes And One Of The Greatest Teen Films Ever Made.",10,19 July 2013,"Sixteen Candles is an hilarious and funny Teen Comedy and one of the best Teen films of all-time. Filled with great direction,a wonderful cast,a well-written and funny screenplay,fantastic laughs and a memorable soundtrack,Sixteen Candles is Teen films and John Hughes at their best.Sixteen Candles tells the story of a teenage girl named Samantha Baker(Molly Ringwald)who is ready to celebrate her sixteenth birthday,but unfortunately for Samantha her family has forgotten her birthday which is the day before her older sister's wedding day. Now with the addition of dealing with a forgotten birthday,Samantha has to deal with liking her High School crush Jake Ryan(Michael Schoeffling)and the pestering of a smooth talking nerd Farmer Ted/The Geek which have hilarious results.Released in 1984,Sixteen Candles was the excellent hilarious and funny Teen classic that started it all,the first of six great Teen films from Teen movie master director John Hughes. By 1984 Teen films were being dominated(with a great deal)by two sub genres:Teen Sex Comedies and Slasher Films but John Hughes gave audiences an alternative with the film Sixteen Candles a Teen movie that is hilarious but has great heart and is a classic that holds up to this day. One of the main reasons Sixteen Candles is such a wonderful movie is because John Hughes takes the simple concepts of teenagers such as growing up,sweet sixteens,love and awkwardness and makes them funny and over the top but with some honesty and truth taking the Teen movie genre to a much higher level. The Comedy and Humor in SC is funny and wild whether it's the film's characters,the dialog or the slapstick Humor that happens throughout the movie and there are times when you watch SC that you bust out laughing at the situations that happen in the film and you are not sure if SC is set in the real world or in a surreal world where anything and everything can happen. I love the fact that SC takes place over the course of two days as we see not just Samantha dealing a forgotten birthday but other characters going through insane and funny situations that are driven by dialog and jokes that are very subtle and in the background. Teenage life in SC as well as other Hughes films is very stylized but realistic because the Teens in Hughes' films feel real and accurate and not cardboard cutouts but real flesh and blood even the hilarious and over the top world that SC is set in. John Hughes loved the world of teenagers and with SC Hughes was just warming up and setting us up for what was to come in his other Teen films. Samantha Baker is classic character in the annuals of Teen movies and is a character we can all relate to because like many male and female teenagers Samantha goes through the many things that adolescents face and experience:falling in love,growing up,feeling awkward and being sensitive. Samantha is a timeless character that could've existed in the past,present and future and will still be relevant and relate to teenagers. The screenplay by John Hughes is well-written and funny with Hughes giving the main and supporting characters hilarious and truly memorable dialog and with scenes that are fresh and exciting. Hughes was a master at giving Teenagers realistic dialog in his films and he does it with greatness here giving the Teen characters dialog that will make viewers laugh but also resonate with viewers. The ending of SC is classic and iconic and is one of the best endings in any Teen movie that will put a smile on many viewers faces because of it's beauty and power. A classic ending to a great film.The whole cast is amazing. Molly Ringwald is excellent as Samantha Baker,with Ringwald bring humor,depth and sympathy to the role. Michael Schoeffling is wonderful as Jake Ryan,Samantha's crush. Anthony Michael Hall is brilliant and hilarious as Farmer Ted/The Geek,,a Geek that likes Samantha and is a smooth talker. Gedde Watanabe is funny and memorable as Long Duk Dong,a foreign exchange student. Haviland Morris is fantastic and sexy as Caroline,Jake's popular girlfriend. Paul Dooley is great as Jim Baker,Samantha's understanding Father. Justin henry is wonderful and funny as Mike Baker,Samantha's younger brother. Edward Andrews(Howard Baker),Billie Bird(Dorothy Baker),Carole Cook(Grandma Helen)and Max Showalter(Grandpa Fred)are hilarious as Samantha's grandparents. Blanche Baker is great as Bride-To-Be Ginny Baker,Samantha's self-centered older sister. Liane Curtis(Randy),John Cusack(Bryce),Darren Harris(Cliff),Carlin Glynn(Brenda Baker)and John Kapelos(Rudy)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for appearances by Joan Cusack(Geek Girl#1),Jami Gertz(Robin),Brian Doyle-Murray(Reverand)and Zelda Rubinstein(Organist). The direction by John Hughes is excellent,with Hughes moving the camera and bringing style and energy to the film. Great job,John.The score by Ira Newborn is wonderful,memorable and lighthearted and matches the film's tone. A great score by Newborn. The film also has a great soundtrack with songs by The Thompson Twins(If You Were Here),The Stray Cats(Sixteen Candles),Billy Idol(Rebel Yell),David Bowie(Young Americans),Spandau Ballet(True),Oingo Boingo(Wild Sex In The Working Class),The Vapors(Turning Japanese),Frank Sanatra(New York,New York),AC/DC(Snowballed),Darlene Love(Today I Met The Boy I'm Gonna Mary),Wham!(Young Guns),Patti Smith(Gloria),Stevie Ray Vaughan(Lenny),Kajagoogoo(Kajagoogoo)and more. A fantastic soundtrack.In final word,if you love John Hughes,Comedies,Teen Films or Coming Of Age Films,I highly suggest you see Sixteen Candles,a funny and hilarious Teen classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Sixteen Candles
65,smakawhat,Now we're both on the pill!,8,15 May 2001,"I had to write about this film after seeing the last 10 minutes of it on TV last night. I didn't miss much after all cause I had seen the film countless times when I was younger.  Man I remember how much I enjoyed it.  This has to be the most 80's character driven film about high school I have ever seen.  It is just plain out stupid funny and heartwarming.While Breakfast Club tries to handle the seriousness of social peers, and Ferris Beuller just solidifies the ultimate 80's experience with some great performances and total hip coolness, Sixteen Candles is just a crazy fun romp through the perils of being a teenager.Ringwald is at her prime as the overburdened teenager, and Michael Hall is at his greatest as the ultimate schemer-geek.  The party aftermath always cracks me up everytime I see it, plus so many more things.Also, there's a scene where the geek gets unloaded out of the trunk of a car, and i SWEAR it's not a human person but a dummy cause the guy does not move but stands like a broomstick..  It's just one of those bizarre movie qwerks I wish someone could explain to me.  And who can forget those alligator shirts....  I laugh now at the way everyone and the bands look in these 80's movies.Alas it seems, Hall and Ringwald got stuck in stereotyped roles that they never seemed to shed or outgrew them as they became adults, which is to bad cause Ringwald, and particularly Hall's comedic sense of timing in this film is just amazing.Rating 8 out of 10.",Sixteen Candles
66,renegadeviking-271-528568,Sixteen Candles review,8,26 January 2020,"First loves and crushed dreams are the subject of this film from the mastermind of John Hughes. Mr. Hughes had written two or three movies before this but this was his directorial debut. Between 1984 and 1986 he wrote five films that dealt with the trauma of being a teenager. He directed four of those himself and all of them have had a lasting impact on a generation of film watchers and film makers. After his sudden and much too early death in 2009, people came out of the woodwork to praise his films and to honor his legacy. Although the movies might be seen as fluff by some, they managed to touch a whole population of kids from this time period in some pretty important ways. This film was the start of that signature sensibility that a decade latched on to.Artists need a muse to reach their greatest heights and John Hughes found his in the sixteen year old actress that starred in three of those five essential teen films from the period. Molly Ringwald had already been in a couple of films I'd seen before this came out. She is the young daughter of the two stars in Paul Mazursky's take on the ""Tempest"" and she was the annoying tag along young sidekick in a 3D Science Fiction film headache called ""Spacehunter:Adventures in the Forbidden Zone"". In those movies she really was a kid, here she is a young woman, glowing on screen and creating a cultural tidal wave that lasted about five years. TimeShe was the ""It"" girl of the eighties. I don't know if it was overexposure, poor role choices or simply America moving on to another child acting phenomenon (as we have done many times before) that slowed down her career. The trajectory she was on was not sustainable, and her film profile dropped to the horizon. I'm sure her career is still successful, she appears on television regularly and pops up in films occasionally, but you can't stay sweet sixteen forever. That is the status she will always have in anyone's mind if they have seen this movie.Her character is Claire,Sam, an average teen girl, looking forward to celebrating the magic number sixteenth birthday. Unfortunately, the day falls one day in front of her older sister's wedding and the rest of the family is so distracted by that event that Claire Samantha gets brushed asides without even a greeting, much less the big party she anticipated. Now it is a stretch of the imagination to believe that her parents, three siblings and four grand parents would all over look this occasion, even under these circumstances. Once we accept that leap of faith, the movie plays it very honestly with the disappointments and regrets that she and her family would likely go through. A sophomore in High School is only a little better than being a Freshman, and when you are an insecure young girl, everything is likely to beat you down. Claire Sam is cute as a button and stylish as all get out in her Hateighties layered look and hair style. Fortunately she does not suffer from the tease that most of the other actresses had done to their hair in this film. Her short bob allows the character to be more identifiable, even thirty years after the fashions had passed. She definitely could rock a hat. To have any sense of reality in this admittedly big fantasy, she has to be the kind of beauty that is natural and a little unconscious.Along with Miss Ringwald, ""Sixteen Candles"" had another less than secret weapon. Anthony Michael Hall had already been in a John Hughes' scripted film, ""National Lampoon's Vacation"". After making a memorable appearance in that very entertaining fim, he shows up making an even bigger splash in this as ""Farmer Ted"" or as he is billed in some versions of the film ""The Geek"". Hall was a slight, youngish fair haired and skinned stand in for Hughes himself. It is perhaps unfair but clearly accurate, that boys and girls mature at different speeds. Both Ringwald and Hall are sixteen when the film is made, but he appears on screen to be at least two years behind her physically and of course emotionally as well. The senior ""Jake"" is the object of her affection but Farmer Ted has her in his sights early on and it is clear he is stepping up out of class. Hall makes the brash geek both boorishly inane and sympathetically likable. He has to carry off the likable part because he makes the most bold request that was ever granted to a geek in High School.The Geek: Can I borrow your underpants for 10 minutes?first_time_sixteen_candlesThis wannabe player, who has never bagged a babe, has made a bet with some of his geek friends that he will have carnal knowledge of his desired woman, and they have demanded proof. The floppy discs that are the payoff for the bet, disappear from use within a few short years of this film. Like eight track tapes before them, the five and a quarter inch discs are merely a legend these days. 8-inch-floppy-disksIn 1984, they were the state of the art for the burgeoning geek community of computer nerds that would define the decade's rebels. It was a big gamble for Farmer Ted but in the end, it would have been a small sacrifice if he had not been able to display those panties triumphantly over his head in the boys room at the dance. Besides, he is the only member of the cast to actually sing a birthday song to Claire on her sweet sixteenth.The passage of time may also render certain other elements of the movie obsolete. The race based jokes about Gedde Watanabe's foreign exchange student are likely to leave viewers of today shifting a bit uncomfortably in their seats. The jokes are still funny, but the caricature of the Asian dork is very un-pc. I imagine the humor that derives from his character's name would still fly in a Apatow film or another chapter in ""The Hangover"" series, but would still raise some ire and make many crusaders for tolerance feel compelled to picket or at least post meme's on Facebook to show their displeasure. The Donger Needs FoodI think a lot will be forgiven in the spirit of the movie, which is mostly a Valentine to shy teens and lonely kids everywhere. The emphasis was more on the culture clash than on belittling the ethnic group depicted. None of the characters except the deliberately unhip and slightly racist grandparents really demeans ""the Donger"" in the film. He also ends up with a girlfriend that emphasizes how much variety there is in the world of teen romance.I also know that there is a great deal of humor that circles around kids being intoxicated or high. This has yet to go away and in fact serves as the premise of a lot of today's comedies. The idea that driving in that condition is funny however, sets off my own PC-prudishness. Let's just move on to some more stuff that is fun and makes the movie worth your time.Teen girls everywhere swooned over the handsome ""Jake"" played by Michael Schoeffling. Eight years older than the other kids, he looks like the kind of guy that everyone would look up to in high school. His character is not a shallow cardboard chiseled profile. He already has a girlfriend in the envied Caroline. She is a little shallow herself, not really in a bad way but in a selfish and short sighted one. It is easy to root for Jake because he wants out of an unsatisfying relationship with an exceptionally attractive partner. I think there needed to be a little more to propel him towards Claire Sam.Somewhere in an editing room, there are out takes of Jake reading the survey that Claire Sam filled out in the Study Hall period they share. A smile, or a warm laugh as a reaction shot would go a long way in making the eventual outcome more believable.In my mind, the biggest hero in the film has always been Claire's""s Sam's Dad. Reportedly, the scene Paul Dooley shares with Molly Ringwald in the living room as she is going to sleep on the couch, was written to pull him into making the movie. Dooley was one of my favorite things about the movie ""Breaking Away"" five years before this. His similar character here adds a little gravitas to the proceedings. Every girl should wish for a Dad who is as understanding and supporting as Mr. Baker is in this movie. Having finally recognized thePep Talkfailure of the family to even acknowledge her birthday, he gives Claire Samantha one of the great presents that any parent could offer their child, his heart. If you are one of those people who think sentimentality is over rated and you detest it in your films, you will have a hard time choking down this sequence. To me, it is the slice of birthday cake that makes everything better.I was twenty-six and married and still two years away from being a father when I saw this movie. Yet it still reached me, even as an outsider to all the demographic groups it was targeted at. The marvel of John Hughes' movies is that they seem to be about everyone in the story, even if a character is there for just a few seconds. Farmer Ted's friends, the girl on the school bus, Caroline, and Claire's Sam's siblings, all get moments to make an impression. Sometimes that impression is heart breaking, and sometime hysterical. That's the way John Hughes saw it and the way he put it on screen. I was happy to add this in a Blu-ray format, to my collection so that I could share my impression of it with the world.",Sixteen Candles
67,Apollo15AnnoPianoCatDogSnailAnt,Proto-Pretty in Pink: triple dynamic again,5,11 July 2020,"Which is good because PrettyIP is my favorite of those movies of this series. Most interesting scenes are between the two guys. In this movie the characters are more of the 'base' variety than in Pretty, the kid guy and the adult-y guy while in Pretty the characters became more creative (the richy guy, and whatever the heck Ducky is, super dope fresh guy?), however this is a perfect precursor to that movie utilizing once more the really proficient 'triple dynamic' where it does not need a group of characters nor one hero but three main 'heroes'. The fact they did Pretty with this same dynamic shows there is something to this. There is a scene that involves the kid guy with a girl in a car toward the end that I am only going to say he should not have done that but hey that is to appeal the mass public audience that 'it's ok,' but hey what am I to pronounce moral decisions? I just noticed a lot of decisions of this movie is because of not the character's own actual wants but just what everyone else around wants them to do, the lesson is to just do what you want not what groupthink wants, like does everything revolve around girls/guys, so horny damn, like what about other interests. Giving this rating because of its baseness compared with PIP and there are just some spots of humor that are great, just need more, however this is a competently made movie, that fans of this stuff would enjoy.",Sixteen Candles

70,Mr_Censored,A Stand-out film that stands the test of time.,9,10 December 2009,"Perhaps nobody understood the plight of the average teenager quite like John Hughes did. Afterall, there's a reason why films such as ""Sixteen Candles"" have sustained relevancy long after the careers of its stars have faded. Mainly, it's because the humor in it is universal and timeless, but also because even teenagers today can relate to its central character, her wacky family members and her sometimes trivial social short-comings.Molly Ringwald plays Samantha Baker, who is mortified to realize that nobody around her notices or acknowledges that it is her sixteenth birthday. Compounded by the fact that her crush, Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling), barely knows she exists and the fact that she can't shake lose a horny and over-enthusiastic nerd (Anthony Michael Hall), Sam just can't catch a break, and the film essentially chronicles a day in her shoes.""Sixteen Candles"" is far from just being a relic of the 80's or simple nostalgia. At its core, it's a film that appeals to almost everyone, young or old, and with each and every watch, never fails to earn a chuckle or two. It's not too over-the-top to be unrealistic, and it never loses its human touch. Whatever gender or generation you come from, it's sure to win you over time and time again.",Sixteen Candles
71,kingofdanerds,Either it should have been rated R or given a PG-13 rating before Red Dawn,6,12 April 2021,"How do I even begin? After rewatching The Breakfast Club I decided that I should watch another Brat Pack film. So, what other film than Sixteen Candles? Sixteen Candles was released in 1984 and notably starred two Brat Pack members, Molly Ringwald (who makes her Brat Pack debut and first notable film debut) and Anthony Michael Hall (who also made his Brat Pack debut here). The film was notably directed by John Hughes who has directed many coming of age flicks. The film was a critical and financial success and is a film that some people still hold close to them to this day but....well on with the review.....Samantha Baker turns 16 today. But nobody remembered her birthday. So she goes about the whole day thinking about a senior guy named Jake whom she likes and basically she is followed around by The Geek and the film depicts what her whole day is like.Sixteen Candles surprises me in many different ways. First off, I knew coming into this film that it was PG. Alright, no problem. But when an f-bomb is dropped within minutes of the beginning, one should be surprised. Why am I so surprised? Because it was my first viewing, that is why. Personally, I am not complaining, it is one f-bomb in a PG film. Somewhat have to admire that. But when nudity comes into play...... HOLY HELL. I was even more surprised by this. Again, I do not have a problem with this and for other reasons other than it being nudity and I won't take any points off of it. But it is things that have to be mentioned at least. But lets get this all out. The PG-13 rating was made yet as it would be made a mere 3 months later with Red Dawn. Here is the thing. PG rated films mean Parental Guidance. Even if it is an R rated film, you are gonna have parents accompanying you. That way if something like this pops up, it is up to the parent to talk it over with their kid or whoever. I personally think that the PG rating was given to this film with that type of mindset and it makes sense too. Gotta think of the big picture. But then again..... the big picture of the film is romance/sex. This is a film that could not be made scene for scene or word for word in today's world. I should note that when I watch a film that I am going to review, I occasionally watch other online reviews of the same film to compare notes and what not. I came across a Youtube video basically asking if this film (Sixteen Candles) still holds up today. I believe the Youtube channel is called Page Six which is I think some sort of online entertainment journal thing. The video basically was about people fondly remembering or basically saying ""I literally just saw this film for the first time like two days ago"" and then going on to trash the film largely for it's......let's just say.......... non PC topics. It comes as no surprise that the video had more dislikes than likes and honestly I think the people in the video were really stretching here. I think a Youtube commenter said it best in that instead of cancelling this film, let's look at it in a way of seeing what was deemed acceptable back then. Sure, even while watching the film, I can see what people would find offensive namely the character of Long Duk Dong. I could delve deeper but I do not feel that I am 100 percent qualified to do so. Some people also ask whether this film is advocates for date rape which, let me be honest, advocate is the wrong word. I think the people behind this film had an idea with, let's just say not bad intentions as they were trying to tell a story. I'll just finish on this topic by saying that while I was not wholly offended by this film, I can easily see why people would be. With all that out of the way, this film is alright at best. I don't see much that stands out. The jokes that wouldn't be deemed offensive by anyone get a good laugh here and there. The acting is fine. The soundtrack is pretty good. But, the problem is with characters in that I don't think they are too developed. Especially this Jake guy. To me, the whole plot around our main character and this Jake guy does not make too much sense to me. But, maybe that is what was intended. I am a (or at least the time of this review) a teenager. So, something should stick right? Well, not really. I just don't understand the connection that these two have. Is everything else pretty understandable? Sure. I think the film shines best with Ringwald despite those little issues. But when she is not on screen (and there does seem to be a pretty big chunk of time) the film somewhat stops. The ending is called ""iconic"" for some reason.Sixteen Candles was a film that I had high expectations for. But, I was ultimately disappointed. It is not bad, just nothing too special.",Sixteen Candles
72,d_m_s,Well it's better than The Breakfast Club,5,16 January 2014,"Molly Ringlwald plays annoying miserable teen in a typical John Hughes filmHughes's usual middle-class dilemmas are dealt with here (""I love him/her but he/she doesn't know I exist...woe is me"")Ringwald's 16th birthday is overshadowed by her older sister's wedding which is occurring the next day. As such, Ringwald mopes about because of this and because the boy she fancies (Jake) apparently doesn't know she exists.While it's infinitely more watchable than The Breakfast Club, it's still pretty dire. Nothing really happens. They go to a school disco, a house party and a wedding. Samantha (Ringwald) tries to get the attention of Jake while 'The Geek' tries to get the attention of Samantha.As usual, the 'cool' kids end up falling in love with the geeks by the end of the film, for absolutely no reason what so ever. It's common in Hughe's films for characters to act in a certain way and for odd situations occur regardless of whether or not it makes sense. E.G. in Sixtenn Candles, Jake, the cool kid with the Ferrari, dumps his girlfriend in favour of the unattractive Samantha, with whom he's never even conversed. At the same time, his girlfriend dumps handsome, Ferrari-driving Jake for gangly, squeaky-voiced geek. It doesn't make any sense but it happens just because John Hughes wants it to happen.As much as I hate to say it, because it's a totally racist aspect of the film, the best character is Long Duck Dong, who is played brilliantly by Gedde Watanabe.",Sixteen Candles

There is a Chinese character in the film named Long Duk Dong and the movie insists to insert the sound of the gong when he is around. This movie may want to be 16 but is clearly 8.Plot does not make sense. Characters do things because the scenes call for it and their actions and reactions bear few connections to reality.The acting...is sometimes tolerable, but any good attempt at acting is spoiled by the writing. People in this film utter some of the most cliché and dumbest lines I have heard in a long while. On top of that you get poop jokes, underwear jokes, only top of the line stuff right here, people.The music, oh the music we haven't covered yet. Let us not stay too long on that subject because it is the cheesiest 80s synth music.Is it a complete wreck? No, it is sometimes funny.

The kid who played the little brother did a good job. I really wanted to hit him. The granparents, everyone who was supposed to do something was great.

Then you go to a highschool dance and try to help out a geek by giving him your underwear (not so believable).

It has lost none of its endearing comedy and heart-tugging sentiment.As a child of the late 80s and early 90s, this film was beyond entertaining. Molly Ringwald as Samantha Baker was so authentic, as a teen whose sixteenth birthday goes unnoticed as her somewhat chaotic family prepares for her older sister's wedding. A quartet of grandparents arrive, much to her chagrin (""I can't believe my grandmother actually felt me up!""), one set which brings a Korean exchange student in tow. On top of this, she easily has the most smart-mouthed, obnoxious little brother on the face of the earth (the superb Justin Henry), who delivers the best sarcastic one-liners, some sample lines: ""Dad, I didn't hit her! I'd like to very much, and I probably will later, but you know my method! I don't hit her when you're just down the hall!"" ""Hey, birth defect!"" and ""I wouldn't go in there, if I were you! Grandpa Fred was in there for half and hour - it's totally polluted!""Then there's school, sweet school. The guy of her dreams, the hunky Jake Ryan (the gorgeous Michael Schoeffling)is the property of the prom queen Caroline (Havilland Morris), while Sam has to fend off the attention of resident geek, Farmer Ted (Anthony Michael Hall, brilliant), and show exchange student Dong around town. Some of the best scenes occur during the school dance, with Sam failing to get a dance with Jake, Farmer Ted attempting to make it with her (but they end up having an interesting conversation instead), Dong finding a girlfriend, and then it cuts to the seedy restaurant where Sam's parents (Paul Dooley and Carlinn Glinn) and sister Ginny (Blanche Baker) meet with her slightly sleazy fiancée Rudy (John Kapelos) and soon to be in-laws with the love theme from ""The Godfather"" playing in the background.""Dong's here for five hours, and he's got somebody. I live here my whole life, and I'm like a disease!"" Sam sulks for the rest of the evening, until her folks finally remember her birthday. More is going on - Dong's at a party at Caroline's house, where everything's getting pretty rowdy, and Jake tires of this endless cycle, and tries to call Sam, not knowing that her grandparents are sleeping in her bedroom (let's just say it's very interesting). After the prom queen passes out, and sub-humans have departed, Jake and Farmer Ted having a touchingly humorous heart-to-heart, with the classic Frank Sinatra tune, ""Strangers In The Night"" as a musical backdrop. There are some very funny revelations and situations that I wouldn't dream of giving away.All the actors excel in their roles, which seem tailor-made for them. Sam's dreams come true, something every teen girl dreams of - the boy you crush on, who seems unobtainable, miraculously notices you, and you're on cloud nine . . . . . .

I also remember the great soundtrack, the true spriritedness of the characters, and feeling so happy afterwards. I admit I was surprised to see a PG rating since it was loaded with language and had some brief nudity, and was stunned to see boom mics showing up in many indoor shots (like the film The Four Seasons). But it was such an endearing film that I forgave all that, and thought it would be great when it would come out on home video.Something went wrong then....due to legalities, some songs on the soundtrack had to be dropped and replaced with other songs, or just silence (in one scene, the David Bowie song Young Americans is taken out and the scene is sans music). And one thing really perplexed me, and I have never ever seen any critics comment on this, the scene where Billie Bird kicks the drunken ""Long Duk Dong"" and calls him a scumbag is completely cut from the videocassette version!To confuse matters more, on television broadcasts, the score is the theatrical version, but the Billie Bird scene is still cut!Here's where things get a bit better: Now that Sixteen Candles is on DVD, the re-issued DVD (not the first batch) has the scene with Billie Bird kicking is back in! The music score and songs are restored and all the footage is back and intact. It's the widescreen version and matted right so the boom mics don't show this time.Now that all the technical points have been made, on to the story.... Well written, snappy pacing, and characters we love in all their weird ways, this is far superior to films like Fast Times At Ridgemont High or American Pie where the aim is to be as lurid and basically sexist as possible. Sixteen Candles handles issues in a heartfelt manner. There are moments of pure inspired comedy, like when Molly Ringwald's grandmother notices her breasts and says ""they're so perky"" and proceeds to reach for them, with a stinging music cue conveying Molly's horror of the incident.I hate to call this a ""teen comedy"" because it can be enjoyed by anyone, but it at least far surpasses any other ""teen comedy"" I've seen since. Alright, I'll go so far as to say this is a classic comedy. Aces!!",Sixteen Candles
86,joshuafagan-64214,Perhaps the Essence of the Eightes,8,24 November 2015,"The first thing that stood out in my head when I watched this film is how it could never be made today. Yes, most films made thirty years ago or further back in the river of time could never be made today- though I have to say it would be hilarious to see the uproar if they released a Bond film with 60s gender politics today- but this film especially sticks out. It got out with a PG rating. Think about that for a second. Pixar movies get PG ratings nowadays. Even if this film went uber-light on everything- which I can tell you it doesn't- it would earn a hard PG-13 on subject matter alone. I don't doubt that it would get an R if it were released today, and even then, some things would likely need to be changed.Now, whether it should be rated R is another matter all together (I don't think I need to argue that some things would need to be changed for a release today either way). If a film like Mockingjay Part 2, one of the tonally bleakest movies I have ever seen in my life, can get out with a PG-13, then a film that drops a slurs and gives a few shots of breasts should definitely not get an R. But I'm getting off-track, aren't I? This film is, at its core, about a sixteen-year-old girl named Sam. It is her birthday, but everyone has forgotten it, as her older sister is getting married. She sneaks off to a party and tries to get the popular boy she has a crush on to notice her. Following her around is a sleazy freshman who plays like he's about ten times bigger than he really is. Hijinks abound.I should really show this movie to a bunch of politically-motivated SJWs just to get a rise out of them. The thing that sticks out the most is how casually and pleasantly they throw around the idea of rape, but there are many more. I should write an article where I pretend to be so offended and list out all the 'terrible offenses' this film makes.Yes, I do agree that a lot of these things shouldn't be in a film like this today and were frankly shocking to see so callously tossed around. But I also say that anyone who cannot see this as a product of its time is missing out on a fine film.If anything, the moral dissonance makes the film more interesting. This is just my opinion, and you don't agree: so be it. But hear me out. Characters that are supposed to be near-entirely sympathetic become more gray, adding layer and texture to the film. It becomes a fundamentally more interesting film than it was back then, just like how every period of history is far more interesting after it's over.But then again, this film doesn't really need help to be interesting. Molly Ringwald as Sam (does it say something about how much I've watched The Breakfast Club that I want to keep writing 'Claire'?) delivers a well-rounded and interesting performance, and the rest of the cast makes sure not to let her down. Anthony Michael Hall is particularly energetic as the pervy freshman.What separates this film from its contemporaries and even from the other teen films of today is the weight it gives to the characters and subject matter. No, it does not slow down to an Oscary movie pace and slowly angst over all that's happening (for the better); and yes, the insensitive aspects of it do let the air out of that sentence, but there is no doubt that Hughes' gift for getting inside the mind of the teenager and pulling out some smart, thoughtful material is alive and well.People can say what people can say, but this film should be seen be everyone at least once. I don't think many other films represented the state of Americana in the eighties, both for better and for worse, as much as this one.And yes, unless you have a heart of stone, you will laugh at least a few times. Embrace this film and the blood, sweat, and tears put into it; I don't think there is any other way to view good art.",Sixteen Candles
87,ogdendc,Good film - but not as good as Ferris,7,6 January 2014,"Samantha Baker (Molly Ringwald) has her 16th birthday but her family are so wrapped up in the impending wedding of her sister Ginny (Blanche Baker) that they have completely overlooked this ('they've forgotten my f******g birthday!'). Her parents (Paul Dooley and Caroline Glynn) are nuts, her grandparents make remarks about her breasts and embarrass her. To add to that, Chinese exchange student Long Duc Dong (donggg!) played by Gedde Watanabe is staying with them.Ted 'The Geek' (Anthony Hall) hits on her at every opportunity. She meanwhile has the hots for school hunk Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling) but he is in a relationship with Carolyn Mulford (Haviland Morris) who is perfect, and we get graphic evidence from the shower scene! The school dance section is beautifully observed. The dialogue between Sam and Ted is wryly constructed ('A lot can happen in a year – you could come back next fall as a completely normal person'. 'Yeah?') and there are some wonderfully surreal moments.This film has a lot of similar elements to John Hughes' later film Ferris Bueller, though with not such strong leads. Ringwald is good but the others not so good. The scene between Hall and Schoeffling is weak and once Ringwald drops out from the action, the drawn-out end of the film drags a bit.There are almost too many comedic elements and so most don't get fully developed. However, I did like the recurring character of the girl in the neck brace. And the music is very cool, even thirty years on (Bowie, Paul Young, Kajagoogoo, Spandau Ballet, The Specials, Nick Heyward, Patti Smith, Altered Images and The Thompson Twins).I watched it, enjoyed it and would happily see some scenes again. But viewed as a whole – not as good as Ferris.",Sixteen Candles

89,treeskier802,Long Duck Dong Steals The Show,10,15 June 2007,"Sixteen Candles is a classic 1980s teen flick starring some of the usual suspects, Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall. The premise is a great idea; amidst the confusion of her older sister's wedding, Ringwald's family completely forgets her 16th birthday.Along the way, Ringwald is embarrassed at a school dance and continually harassed by the lovable dork played by Hall.Perhaps the primary bright star of this film, however, is the absolutely hilarious Chinese exchange student Long Duck Dong, played by Gedde Watanabe. Long Duck Dong is the life of the party, making out with his ""hot American girlfriend"" while at the same time riding an exercise bike (unbelievable hilarious scene) and waking up drunk outside Ringwald's house on the day of the wedding.The movie is not Shakespeare. You are not going to get an epiphany watching it. You are not going to learn a damn thing. But, it is a cute romantic comedy with that 1980s flair that we all know and love. John Hughes directed. Rating 10 of 10 stars...it's a classic in this genre.",Sixteen Candles

93,missygoldstein,Then And Now,10,19 April 2006,"I was a teenager when this movie came out so naturally I loved it. I watched it again last night (had seen it a million times) and it's funny, but honestly I don't think a movie like that could come out today and be successful or well thought of.First off; I kind of thought Molly's character was kind of a loser. She was very whiney and bratty and it would be very hard to believe that she'd end up with Jake or that he'd see anything in her.When I watched it as a kid I thought Molly was the best. I still like her, but not crazy about that character. I did however think Anthony Michael Hall was the #1 reason to watch this movie. He was so funny. He was an uber geek, but as he said ""I'm kinda like king of the dipshits"" and he played that so well. I loved when he met her on the dance floor and says ""alllll riiiiiight"" with the come hither look.I also loved long duck dong. Very funny. ""what the hell are you bitchin about?

97,rams_lakers,Interesting Movie Factoids,7,13 July 2004,"From ""Backstory"" on AMC: Director John Hughes was impressed by Anthony Michael Hall in National Lampoon's Vacation and cast him over a young Jim Carrey who also tried for the part. Hall was shy in person, but when they put a camera in front of him they were surprised at his outgoing talents. The guy who played Molly's father compared him to a young Woody Allen. Gedde Watanabe came straight into casting speaking like a Korean Exchange student in which he did an impersonation of his Korean friend. Everyone thought he was really foreign until he revealed himself later as a perfect English speaking Asian American. Pay close attention to that table scene where everyone was looking at Watanabe and laughing. Before they filmed the scene, Hughes had told Watanabe to stuff grapes in his nose while they filmed the reactions of the family so he could get their actual reactions. You'll notice as they cut to Molly during the scene that she laughs but kind of cringes and looks surprised. In another scene Watanabe was lying on the grass and laughing hysterically at the family but was running out of laughter and had a hard time keeping it going, so Hughes tickled his feet off camera to get him to continue laughing as the cameras kept rolling. Molly's little brother also played the kid in Kramer vs Kramer. Molly became a huge cultural icon for young girls after this movie came out and her career took off.An 80's classic, when the DVD goes on sale I plan on purchasing it. You may also want to do this as the basic cable versions are sliced up by Mormons with a ginzu.",Sixteen Candles
98,babybuletgani,The DNA of John Hughes' debut can be found in just about every high-school,6,11 November 2019,"The DNA of John Hughes' debut can be found in just about every high-school comedy since, though let's be clear: this is a prototype that many, Hughes included, would improve upon. His chief innovation was to marry frat-house funnies to an empathetic, sweet vision of teenage angst, centred on Molly Ringwald's woes when her family forgets her birthday. Hughes' gift for dialogue and casting arrives fully formed, but the story's a mess, sidelining Ringwald in favour of subplots whose casual racism and sexism are wince-inducing.",Sixteen Candles
99,crispy_comments,My So-Called Life meets...Porky's?! Is this movie for girls or boys?,3,20 January 2007,"Funny, I saw this as a young kid and the only thing that made an impression on me was the beginning when Molly Ringwald's parents forget her birthday, and the final scene where she gets her happy ending. I must've blocked out everything inbetween because I didn't understand it at that age... Watching ""Sixteen Candles"" again as an adult, I was stunned by how racist, sexist and crass most of the movie is. How can it be so revered, I wonder? Crude sex-jokes, over-the-top humour, cringe-worthy Asian stereotypes... yikes. Most offensive is the scene where Molly's older-man crush hands his unconscious girlfriend over to The Geek and encourages him to have his way with her while she's passed out. What the hell? Is this movie actually condoning RAPE?! Unbelievable. And we're supposed to root for an innocent young girl to hook up with this creep?I know many teen comedies from the early '80s still had that '70s sensibility, and nudity/vulgarity was common. But I just didn't expect Porky's-style hijinks from John Hughes movies, which are often acclaimed for their realistic portrayal of teen life. This particular film seems to get many positive reviews for being groundbreaking in it's realism. But this ain't *my* version of reality.I dunno, maybe ""Sixteen Candles"" was, at the time, a step up from previous teen movies. Still, it's definitely my least favorite Hughes film, and I wouldn't recommend it to any impressionable youngsters out there who might pick up some very bad messages...if they have a better memory than I did.",Sixteen Candles
100,tvspace,watchable but not good,4,18 May 2008,"Sixteen Candles is a watchable, paint-by-numbers teen romance. It's mostly interesting for early glimpses of actors who would go on to do later, better work (especially John and Joan Cusack). The story is too over-the-top to resonate on an emotional level, but it isn't clever enough to get more than the occasional chuckle. It doesn't even do a particularly good job of capturing the mood of the era, though it's inevitable, of course, that some of that comes through. Ultimately this film can't hold a candle to director John Hughes' next project, The Breakfast Club, which does a considerably better job capturing the exploits of mid-80's high schoolers without all the two-dimensional, misanthropic portraits of the older generations cluttering up the movie as they do here.",Sixteen Candles

This is Anthony's best performance in any movie I think. And you cant help but have a super huge crush on Jake by the time the movie ends.

Gedde Watanabe is sensational as Long Duck Dong, and Ringwald's little brother is a fount of comic wealth beyond his years. Especially neat are the scenes of a young John and Joan Cusack! (Does John put his relatives in every one of his films? I should check my family tree. Maybe he can get me a job.) Of course, the humour eases the tension of the moving, intense storyline. It's good to know the mousy girl can still win the hunk, but in the process, did she have to dump on the nerd who also liked her? The birthday cake scene is one of the most captivating in any film. What really rocked my world is the fact Ringwald looks exactly like my ex-girlfriend, who's probably dating a hunk right now. Watch this one with a big box of Kleenex.",Sixteen Candles

It is the typical John Hughes suburban teenage comedy and out of all of them this is probably the best. It plays off of every teenager's biggest nightmare - What if my parents forget my 16th birthday? - and moves from there.  It also follows Samantha's, played wonderfully by Molly Ringwald attempts to win the affections of the school's most popular upperclassman Jake Ryan while simultaneously avoiding the advances of the school's coolest nerd (Anthony Michael Hall at his finest).  There are terrific comedic performances throughout this movie (most notably, Gedde Watanabe as Long duk Dong).

106,evancyl,"Great portrayal of teenage angst, but partly lacking in believability",6,3 January 2015,"This being John Hughes' most popular teen comedy, I was somewhat disappointed. Sixteen Candles is about high school sophomore Samantha Baker's struggle to get through her 16th birthday. Busy preparing for her older sister Ginny's wedding the next day, Sam's family has completely forgotten her birthday. At school, Sam is crushing on a senior who seemingly has no idea that she exists. On the bus home, a dorky freshman, Farmer Ted, pesters her for a date. Her grandparents show up the house and take over her room. To top it off, even the Vietnamese exchange student manages to find a date at the school dance faster than Sam. Unknown to her though, things are about to take a turn for the better.The parts of the script relating to Sam were excellent. All the things that could go wrong on a girl's Sweet Sixteen went wrong. Molly Ringwald put in an splendid performance as Sam, conveying all the angst and desires that her character experienced. Michael Hall was perfect as Farmer Ted, trying desperately to be cool but unable to shake off his dorkiness. However, the entire storyline relating to Sam's crush was not very believable. Apart from picking up the balled-up 'sex quiz' in class and seeing his name, there was absolutely nothing to draw him to Sam. Also, most guys wouldn't pursue a girl to that extent without first having a decent conversation with her in school. The whole after-the-after-party episode was also rather ludicrous. While I doubt things in America are that crazy, perhaps they are crazy enough for all this to be not so much of a stretch for viewers there - this might explain why the movie had such wide appeal.",Sixteen Candles

I'd forgotten how funny it was until I bought the DVD on a whim and saw it for the first time in years in an uncut form.  This is John Hughes' masterpiece, a farce about a teenage girl's day from you-know-where and a geek's quest for manhood, framed by wild, raunchy, over-the-top cultural touchstones any 80's high school student will recognize immediately.  Much funnier than PRETTY IN PINK, much less pretentious than THE BREAKFAST CLUB, and much cooler than FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF.  Stick this movie in a time capsule; no other film captures the essence of all things 80's quite like it.",Sixteen Candles

I am one of them.I cop to the fact that it could be due to the ""teenager effect"":  themovies you saw around 13 will always be your favorites.  But I thinkit's more than that.  Clearly John Hughes was, in 1982, an insanelytalented writer at the top of his game.  He went on to write teenclassics The Breakfast Club and Ferris Beuhler in quicksuccession after this.  Sixteen Candles was not his first script(Vacation, another comedy classic, preceded this) but it was hisdirectorial debut, and he's firing on all cylinders.I love the way that Hughes gives such respect to his teen subjects. He realizes that things DO matter more when you're a teenager,because you're experiencing it all for the first time.The second incredible thing about this movie is Anthony MichaelHall's performance as the geek.  I challenge you to find anotherperformance by a teenager that is funnier, anytime, anywhere.  Heis simply incredible.  I think he deserved an oscar nomination for itand people think it's crazy but I stick by that.Hughes' sense of humor is appropriately juvenile at times, and hisuse of sound effects can seem a little bush-league.  Of course, theracist caricature of Long Duck Dong is a blight on the movie (thenagain, most of the characters are drawn in broad strokes, butwhen it comes to race there are different rules of conduct).

Sixteen Candles in my opinion is pure perfection. Molly Ringwald is so wonderful as this girl coming into herself who just wants to be noticed. I'm still in love with her, after all these years. I wish she would have taken Pretty Woman and Ghost, she would still be around, but any who. John Hghes cat perfectly every time and especially here with the casing of the geek and Jake Ryan. now I'm a guy buy Jake Ryan is dreamy(he he), and the guy is not bad looking at all.

He writes his films with such intelligence and they are still so funny. My favorite thing in the whole movie is when the bus is riding down the street and the band is playing the instruments. Every time i see it it kills me. It is the little things that count in John Hughes movies, and i really hope he brings back some more movies because i miss you john and your films that make you feel good inside(ya ya i said it).

114,Idolprincess,A real coming of age movie,7,16 June 2004,"Very few teen movies that have been made were really about teenagers. I'm personally not too fond of the teen movie genre, but I've watched several of these movies in the past. If everyone agrees that John Hughes has produced some of the most accurate portrayals of teenage life, it's because there's a good reason to believe this. John Hughes has done several ""silly"" comedies such as ""Weird science"" or ""Vacation"". Even though these movies weren't intellectual films, they're true classics in my opinion. The same humor that was present in these films is present in ""Sixteen Candles"", but it's never overpowering like in some other teen films. Also, unlike most modern teen movies, it doesn't involve popular kids acting like idiots or trying to find a girl to sleep with, but this is irrelevant here.This movie is about Samantha Baker. Her family completely forgot her 16th birthday. This is also a day in her life. We learn what she goes through in high school and about her family life. It's very hard not to relate to Samantha because she has so many insecurities that teenagers have. She never comes off as a hero or as a phony character. This is what is so good about the movie. Her personality and her reaction to her surroundings are so genuine that it's hard to criticize. Farmer Ted, the geek, is another very real character in my opinion. I would definitely recommend it. *** Spoilers ahead! ***The only thing that personally bothered me was the ending since it wasn't very realistic. It was supposed to be a realistic movie after all.. I wasn't expecting Samantha to end up with Farmer Ted, and I'm not quite sure if an ending like this would have been better. However, it's possible that a girl like Samantha would end up with the popular boy even if it's a little unlikely. This is why I'm choosing not to let it ruin the movie.",Sixteen Candles

Their first date is hilarious, and the scene in the gym with her friend is hilarious. I've seen this movie at least ten times, and I still cry at the end. It's a chick flick in many ways, but in the standard 80s fashion there are enough viewpoints from the male perspective that males can enjoy this movie and identify with the leading men as much as females can identify with Molly's character.",Sixteen Candles

The story follows her after her parents forget her 16th birthday. She has to deal with her sister getting married, and also having a huge crush on one of the most popular boys in school, Michael Schoeffling. This film is one of the best comedies I have ever seen. It's quirky, tacky and over the top in every right way. The soundtrack to this film is also a highlight, and is truly one to be enjoyed.But, a predictable ending and some goofs that go too far drag the film down a bit. It's a film that is meant to be over the top, but sometimes when a film goes too wild, your suspension of disbelief is broken and you have a hard time believing or even enjoying what you're seeing.",Sixteen Candles

124,HardToFindMovies,10 out of 10 Early John Hughes Comedy Classic,10,4 January 2014,"Sixteen Candles was written and directed by the late great John Hughes and has withstood the test of time to become a comedy classic. Molly Ringwald is a funny sympathetic character that holds the viewers attention and she is supported by a strong cast. Anthony Michael Hall steals every scene he is in as the freshmen 'king of the dipsh*ts' and he definitely hits his mark with his delivery of very funny dialogue. I saw this film in the theaters when it was first released as a rather low budget comedy and you could actually see the boom mike hanging down from the top of the screen....especially in the scene where a weeping Molly is on the sofa discussing her problems with her dad....the boom mike was somehow edited out of the later prints. To be clear this is a must see 1980s comedy and is one of the top 20 films of the entire 1980s....from the sick partying of 'house parties' to the innocence of high school dances this film is non-stop laughs and moves quickly without any real slow spots. The film has barely begun before the viewer realizes that Molly's all important 16th birthday has been completely forgotten by her entire extended family and her own home has been taken over by crazed relatives here for her sister's wedding. Viewers should keep an eye out for both a young Jon Cusack as one of the nerds who gets locked in a car trunk and also his sister Joan Cusack who dates Long Duk Dong the wild exchange student. You need to seek out this comedy and get some great laughs...you can thank me later. Tom Wilson, New Jersey, USA, (HardToFindMovies)",Sixteen Candles

However, after re-watching it at a more mature age, I'm shocked at how I didn't notice how alarming some of the stuff in this film is! First of all, how can a movie that is so highly regarded have an incidence of rape that is completely glossed over and considered ""okay""?? Why are none of the characters even slightly alarmed by what happens? I was honestly surprised by how racist and sexist this movie is.

I think the John Hughes 80's teen movies are the best and basically defined a generation.  If we weren't like the people in this movie, we tried to become them after we saw it.  A lot of people were influenced by this and the other films, many new young directors credit John Hughes and you can see the Hughes influence in many current teen movies.

128,Wardman3,2019 review of an 80s classic,9,21 November 2019,"I am a child of the 80s and was 15 when this came out... I loved it then and I love it now. I want to address the issues that have arisen in today's age in regards to a film from 1984. The inferred """" scene has come under scrutiny over the years and I can understand why in this climate. However, it was a different time back then...It is not a reason to validate it, but no one was thinking about it the way people do today... You can not go back and alter time, or censor things we do not like because society has changed. Would this scenario play in a comedic movie today? Of course not.
As far as the rest of the movie, I still crack up every time at multiple scenes...John Hughes had a talent in casting and writing about teen age life in the 80's and he was spot on. Casting was perfect...
In summary, if you are not from the era, you will probably not understand the huge influence this had on all of us born from 1965-1975. but it brings all of us back to a time where things were far more innocent and political correctness did not affect every aspect of our daily lives",Sixteen Candles
129,Dennue,Great when you are too young to know any better,6,14 July 2015,"This was one of my favorite teen movies when I was a kid, meaning, before I was even a teen. I remember watching this, along with Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller, and thinking it was clearly the best of the three due to it's wacky humor that never felt so absurd that it took you out of the movie.Cut to years later, watching this as a 26 year old. Wow, while it still stirs up some of my nostalgic emotions it also stirs up a lot of disgust.First, the racism. I always thought, as a kid, that the Long Duk Dong character seemed like an offensive caricature but as an adult I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt. I don't believe the character himself is offensive, it's more the way the character is presented. For example, a gong rings almost every time the character's name is said out loud. And the music that plays when his character is on screen is also stereotypical. As for the character himself, he seems like a nerd but is actually the life of the party, which isn't very stereotypical at all. Still, it's a shame they had to stoop to cheap sound racist sound effect jokes.Next, the gender issues. Ted the nerd sexually harasses Molly Ringwald throughout the entire movie, we're meant to think this is funny but really it's just kind of infuriating. Next, her romantic interest Jake says he could violate his drunk, passed out, girlfriend 100 different ways if he wanted to. Ted says something along the lines of ""what are you waiting for?"". WOAH, is Ted, this character that we're supposed to laugh along and sympathize with really condoning that Jake rape his passed out girlfriend? To make things worse, Jake offers his passed out girlfriend to Ted if Ted will help him pursue Molly Ringwald. So now Jake and Ted are using the rape of another character as a means of bargaining. It's insane to that this part of the script was ever greenlit. The whole thing is very gross and creepy but it doesn't ever feel like the intent is to say ""look how creepy and awful these guys are"" instead, we're just supposed to laugh along with them, which is pretty disgusting.I know what you're probably thinking, if I'm so offended by it then why did I still give it a 6/10. Well, when it comes down to it there is still a lot of content here that is relatable when you are a teenager and there is still quite a bit of comedic gold. It would be wrong to say that the movie is without it's merit so a 6/10 it is.",Sixteen Candles

136,issalambert,**One of my all time favorite movies** Spoilers,10,28 August 2002,"This is one movie that I remember watching as a young girl and as a teenager and later as an adult. Early on I spent most of my time fantasizing about Jake Ryan and now I get most of my kicks from laughing at Long Duk Dong. John Hughes is by far the most talented director of all time. He has a knack for striking the chords of youth and presenting teenage material in a way that anybody can relate to. I mean how many of you can remember ""loathing the bus?"", or knowing a geek somewhat like ""Farmer Ted?"" My favorite part of the movie is when Samantha's parents and grandparents find Dong passed out on the front lawn stinking of ""Canine Cologne"" and giving grandpa a rendition of what happened to his ""aut-o-m-bile"". It is too funny for words!! The party scene where Farmer Ted and his friends knock on the door and Dong answers it while hanging on the door with his legs wrapped around the frame saying, ""come on in and party hard, dude-people"", his new All-American girlfriend then proceeds to pick him off the door frame and carry him into the party is absolutely hilarious! The entire movie is full of humor that I can appreciate. I also could relate to the ""Jaws"" or ""Twilight Zone""(depending on what movie version you have) musical theme that played as Samantha came across her grandparents raiding her bedroom to stay for the weekend. You will laugh as her grandpa eyes her chest and says to grandma,""Let me go get my magnifying glass!""  And what girl doesn't love a happy ending, especially with the ever-so-handsome Jake Ryan? If you grew up in the eighties and need a good love story or a good laugh rent this movie.

I wish movies were like the old classic movies, movies nowadays are somewhat a rip off, i'm not saying all but most movies made in this era are all computerized, there's so much plastic surgery happening, drastic diets, if you look back at the old movies, the ladies are really beautiful naturally, nice hair, and the spark in those eyes, men were romantic. I watched Sixteen Candles for the first time, and i enjoyed it. I liked Pretty in Pink better though. Sixteen candles is a really funny yet in a sweet romantic sort of way....the geeks and the Duck guy, hilarious! i enjoy watching classic movies, eg. dirty dancing, ghost, gremlin, pretty in pink, ghost busters.... I wouldn't recommend this movie to kids 14+, especially if you don't like watching classic movies. But to those out there who were teens in the 80s, this might bring back your high school memories.

149,compage,Fantastic movie for the 80's. Please ignore all the haters...,10,1 October 2018,"I happened to be reading another movie review on IMDB and my daughter had asked me something trivia related regarding Sixteen Candles, a favorite of mine (having seen it in the theatre long ago) and of my daughters.I have to say I was moderately horrified by the negative reviews. Reviews that characterize this movie as racist and endorsing rape. Frankly, people today have way too much free time on their hands.This was a comedy and I'll address the two major points that several people have taken umbrage with regarding this movie.First, the character, Long Duck Dong, the visiting exchange student. Several reviewers have expressed outrage and described the character as a racist portrayal of a character in of all things, a movie from 32 years ago. The irony here is that the character is a parody rather than a racist demonstration. Duck is literally the character in the movie that has the least issues and is the most comfortable with himself. If this is racism, how come no one talks about Justin Chon in 21 and over? Passed out for half the movie, running around in drag etc. Or Ken Jeong in the Hangover movies. Both characters have far worse behavior in much more modern times. Yet the Donger parties and meets a girl and its racist. Or how about Asian comedians that poke fun at their own culture? Margaret Cho for example. The vast majority of her material is making fun of her culture. Now those are examples of reverse racism and it is very common in comedy. No one says anything negative when Jerry Seinfeld mocks jewish culture or Russell Peters makes fun of Indian culture.It's comedy and self deprecating comedy at that. Given Duck is pretty much one of the funniest characters in the movie, its ironic that people that I expect are non asian are taking umbrage with his portrayal.Regarding the endorsement of rape, yet another unbelievable interpretation. It's so bad that Molly Ringwald who maintained for years that this was her favorite movie to act in has now come out and said she is uncomfortable in the content. Metoo has forced her to publically change her opinion on a piece of work she clearly loved and that launched her career. For those that haven't seen the movie or forget here is the scene. The senior that is interested in Molly Ringwald (another fun joke is reviewers talking about how a much older character should be interested in Ringwald and yet in the movie they are only separated by 2 years) has a girlfriend. He finds her shallow and uninteresting given that she drinks and parties etc. He decides after the girlfriend trashes his house and passes out drunk that he is done with her. The character played by Anthony Michael Hall is at his house for the party. After Anthony shares that Ringwald is interested, Jake offers Anthony his car and indicates that he can drive her home. When Anthony suggests he is crazy, Jake states, ""I could violate her 10 different ways and she wouldn't notice because she was so drunk.And herein lies the crux of the haters. Jake and his GF are presumably in a sexual relationship (its inferred but not shown). At no point does he tell Michael Anthony Hall to violate or take advantage of her, he merely offers him a car to drive her home. His violation comment speaks to the state of her inebriation and that she would not recognize Hall if he drove her home.The next day, Hall and Caroline wake up in the back seat of a car fully clothed. They talk about whether or not they had sex but neither is sure. Both had been drinking and had fallen asleep. They kiss and that's about it.Impressive that two people that are apparently drunk awake fully clothed (hall with his retainer wire on) with no memory of intimacy and yet the inference is that he took advantage of her.My daughter who also loves this movie discussed the scene with me after I had read the comments and she was as confused as I was.This is a timeless movie about overcoming stereotypes as were most of Hughes' movies (Duck the shy Asian asserting himself, Molly coming out of her shell, the jock taking interest in a girl that was actually interesting, Hall the geek becoming pretty damn cool).My suggestion is that anyone that heaps hate on this teen comedy from 32 years ago steer clear of the spate of current teen comedies like ""Blockers"" or the aforementioned ""21 and over"" or heaven forbid movies like the American Pie series or even Animal House.",Sixteen Candles

They are some real funny and shocking moments where there's an Asian exchange who gets drunk, and where Jake lets his girlfriend go home with another boy in his dad's Royal's Royce!

First of all, the main character, Samantha, was a pretty well drawn character. She is 3 dimensional as main characters are meant to be. She is also pretty funny and relatable. The second was the wedding scene that was pretty funny. But that's about it in terms of good stuff.Now the bad stuff. I had to watch this film for media studies and it made me feel physically sick, it was a completely revolting film. Now I'm gonna tell you why there are two MAJOR issues with this film first off it is RACIST (and homophobic but not as glaringly). The exchange student was there simply to add to the chaos of the household but was just walking semi stereotyped walking gag. The big rat that topped this super coated cake was believe it or not RAPE. Yep, the geek character takes advantage of the drunk popular girl at a party, it is not shown, but the morning after she is, (apparently) fine with it! completely unrealistic and also what the (insert ten thousand super bad swear words) kind of message is this sending to young people especially males. Now something else that made my blood boil was that the romantic interest was the one who suggested and helped this geek guy date rape his girlfriend. Apparently the audience is still supposed to be looking forward to seeing said guy kiss the girl. So for an alternative ending, I imagined Samantha jumping in Jake's car then repeatedly running both Jake and the geek over while eating her cake. This helped me keep my lunch inside the lining of my stomach.I understand people saying to watch film in the context of the time and place they were made, I certainly managed to keep that in mind when watching Rebel without a cause. However Sixteen Candles cannot be watched with this in mind, it has no excuse whatsoever.so please please please do not let anyone, old or young, male or female ever see this film",Sixteen Candles

158,bookgirl-2,Everyone can relate to this film.,8,27 June 1999,"Not only does this movie touch on the typical teenage themes, but it also shows a family situation that everyone can, in some way relate to. A good movie to watch when you just need an escape and remember the 1980s.",Sixteen Candles
159,mydnight-1,Not worth it,1,26 December 2006,"There is rarely a film I ever give a bad review on, but in this case I'll make an exception. This film was truly horrendous. Maybe I approached it in the wrong angle, not at all used to the idealism of the 80's, but this movie represented all that was horribly cliché and unrealistic about high school and typical suburban life.All the jokes were stereotypical, whether it was making fun of the freshman geek or the Chinese exchange student. The scenes that were supposed to be poignant and heart-felt were instead mawkish and completely fake. Who's to believe that a handsome high school senior, disillusioned by the party life, would ever take a second glance at a gawky sophomore? I couldn't even bring myself to feel sorry for the main character, whose constant 'woe is me' asides at the audience made me want to slap her and tell her to grow up.In all, a lot of eyerolling went on. I only watched it for some hope that the film would redeem itself. It ended on the worst note possible.",Sixteen Candles
160,narcissussins,Hasn't aged well,2,28 June 2013,"Call me over sensitive, but I really hated this movie. From the racist caricature of the 'Chinaman' to the flippant treatment of rape (seriously, your romantic hero trades a night with his drunk girlfriend for another girl's panties...swoon), Sixteen Candles struck me as far more mean-spirited than funny. Yeah, yeah, ""lighten up! It's just a movie!"" I'll lighten up when race is more than a punchline, when boys learn that being too drunk to consent means no consent.Cheap humour.On the plus side, it's kind of a kick to see the technology of yesteryear. Floppy disks! Phones the size of your head!",Sixteen Candles
161,darkshines99,Not one of John Hughes' Best Films,6,15 September 2020,"The 1980's nostalgia is great but personally I don't think either in terms of plot, characterisation or likeability this film is one of John Hughes' best.It's the usual 'nerd fancies the most popular girl in school' and gets her, despite it being utterly implausible and, at times, creepy. Some of the scenes border on sexual harassment, especially the one in the car.There's also a stupidly stereotypical portrayal of a young Asian man that hasn't aged well at all (rather like in Breakfast at Tiffany's).I think the Breakfast Club is so much better, the characters more realistic and much better paced.",Sixteen Candles
162,nicolabennett_80,I used to like this film... not anymore,1,23 June 2007,"Reading all the comments about how funny and amazing and ""true"" this film is, I hope that the world has progressed a LOT since it was made or that the people who commented didn't actually see the vast majority of this film. When I first saw it as a child, I thought it was great too.I recently had the chance to see it again, and I cannot believe how awful it actually is. This film is racist, sexist, classist and homophobic and not in a satirical way. It casually condones and glorifies rape (yes, having sex with someone who is too drunk to even know who you are is actually rape).The only good thing about this film is the soundtrack.",Sixteen Candles
163,Caitlin-9,Great movie!,8,5 July 1999,This movie displays those teenage years wonderfully!  I've laughed every time I've seen it.  Molly Ringwald does a great job at the acting and anyone can relate to her.,Sixteen Candles
164,princess81,you will love this hysterical movie!,9,29 November 1999,"Sixteen Candles is such a great movie. If you are in a bad mood or just in a mood to laugh; watch it. You have to like the Donger. No matter what age you are, you can relate to at least one subject in this movie. If you have not seen it- you are missing out. Be prepared to laugh!!",Sixteen Candles
165,cmatherl,Left me with a bad taste in my mouth,1,2 April 2000,"I love the movies of the 80s... I really like a lot of brat pack flicks.... John Hughs' other film made around this time, Breakfast Club?  It's great, Four Stars!  But 16 candles is not very good.  Initially, I liked the humor; it was more shocking and contemporary than I expected, with an ironic twist. But the film's premise degenerates quickly into a huge nonsensical mess... NOT good old 80's fun mess, but stupid, racist, sexist drivel.  At times, the attempts at humor made my jaw drop, they were so inappropriate and extremely unfunny.  Breakfast Club similarly toyed with audience expectations and broke rules concerning the handling of subject matters like sex, drugs and society in high-school; it ended up being a very honest, poignant film that made you laugh your ass off....  it's no Citizen Kane, but Breakfast Club = good flick.  If you are in the mood for a night with the brat pack, my suggestion is to skip 16 Candles, a film I found offensive and devoid of anything entertaining, in favor of the far superior Breakfast Club. :)",Sixteen Candles
166,surlyhotep,After reading some reviews here I added a star,9,15 January 2021,"This has always been my favorite Hughes film although after the expected snowflake hysteria I added a star for the absolute joy anything that offends that crowd brings me. I understand how they feel though as I'm disgusted and refuse to watch any of the ""woke"" trash hollywood churns out these days.
Most people used to understand almost nothing was out of bounds in comedy, and most importantly if you take anything serious from a near cartoon comedy like this you need to be locked in a nice gen z safe space.
Great flick, a classic.",Sixteen Candles
167,littlepinkmafia,"The *original* ""Freaks & Geeks""- life in the 80s",10,22 July 2001,"Let's be honest. *Everyone*, and I mean *everyone*, can relate to this movie, regardless of age or gender, or any other boundaries that set us a part.We all come together in the movie's simple yet poignantly true message:Life never follows the course we plan for it.Who among us has never played the rejected geek? Who's never been the wallflower? And, perhaps most importantly, who can honestly say they've never felt out of place and alone?No one.For that one reason, anyone can feel for Sam, our heroine who sees happiness as such a distant place, or ""Farmer Ted"" (^_~), the victim of misplaced affections and braces...and even Jake, stuck in a the rut of conformity.We've all been there...all of us. Everyone gets jealous, everyone longs for something, and everyone thinks the grass is greener on the other side.Sure, maybe not everyone has a flaky, self-centered older sister, or has had their panties on display in the boy's bathroom, but beyond it all, the common moral remains.See it, if you haven't.Thank me later. ^_~",Sixteen Candles
168,sgragen,Fav movie ever!,10,28 November 2006,"This has got to be my favorite movie of all times! it's the best teen movie out there!! I love the 80's and this movie reflects its so well. I think they picked the cast perfectly. It is so true, and so funny! I do think that rating is not correct though. I think that it def should be higher, but i guess those were different times! I think that picked great music for it as well! I could watch it everyday.. its that good. If you are going to let your kids watch it i would def. watch it for because of the language and nudity.. but i think its good for mature audiences. Overall, the movie was really good with casting, music, fashion, and the storyline, truly a great 80's movie!",Sixteen Candles
169,carltondeanna,Love it!!,10,4 November 2007,"John Hughes....80's.....the ""brat pack"" it does not get any better. Mind you, these were the days of my youth. I love this movie! Along with the Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink. I am 31 years old now and although I am full of substance and value people, places and movies much differently than I did in my youth...these films are great. They are innocent and sweet. If they only made movies like this today for our children. I believe that if you were female and between the ages of 6 and 24 when these movies were made...you agree with me. The music is 80's and it brings you back. This movie leaves you feeling good...it is lighthearted and not deep...no thinking involved. Just a sweet film that you can sit and watch with your 10 year old daughter.",Sixteen Candles
170,cdourado,"A classic film, guaranteed to put a smile on your face.",10,26 June 2008,"I first saw Sixteen Candles in 1985, i was aged 18 years old. I loved the film then and i still love the film. For me this is possibly the funniest teen comedy of all time. Every other teen comedy worth watching since has used 16 candles as a template. I love American pie but i wonder if it would have come to fruition without the existence of 16 candles. One of the things that made 16 candles so great in my opinion is the performance of Anthony Michael Hall, his performance was certainly worthy of an award of some sort, maybe even an Oscar! I've often wondered why the Oscars don't have an award for the best actor under 18 years category. If, like many of us, you found your teen years a little confusing and sometimes painful then perhaps this film is for you. I would suggest most teenagers, certainly in the western world if not the whole world, will be able to relate to this classic film. Superbly written, cleverly observed by John Hughes and stands the test of time, this is a film worth watching and guaranteed to put a smile on your face if not make you laugh out loud. Watch and enjoy.",Sixteen Candles
171,gunshydaffodil,Crêpe,1,27 March 2006,"I would've given this hideously poor film A BIG FAT ZERO, if it weren't for Joan Cusacks 3 minutes of scene stealing genius. She's the best thing about this film, and she doesn't even say a word.This is no Ferris Bueller's Day Off Tisn't The Breakfast Club Tisn't St Elmo's Fire Tisn't even as good as the parody of John Hughes films that is Not Another Teen MovieIt's just crêpe.DO NOT WATCH THIS MONSTROSITY OF CELLULOID",Sixteen Candles
172,ShiLiNa,Sexist & racist to its core,1,24 July 2020,"I watched this movie because I had heard quite a lot of references to it and felt like I was missing out on some important pop cultural knowledge. I can't believe that throughout all those references no one had mentioned how racist and sexist this movie is! When I watch older classics, I am more forgiving with these things. Eventhough sexism and racism are always horrible, if I couldn't let one or two scenes slip by, I couldn't watch a lot of movies older than 10 years. But this movie does not only have a few problematic scenes or lines. The whole story is racist and sexist. From the horrible two main male characters over having the sound of a gong play everytime the Chinese exchange student's name is said and calling him ""Chinaman"" to actually displaying the rape of a drunk girl as a way of getting together with her. I'm horrified!",Sixteen Candles
173,nicole1125,Sixteen Candles,10,15 February 2006,"This movie was awesome. It is my favorite chick-flick of all time. Anthony Michael Hall's performance was great. His character was so funny and adorable in this movie; and Molly Ringwald was nothing short of astounding. And my favorite line from Farmer Ted of course, ""Can I borrow your underpants for ten minutes?"" Hilarious. And of course, the random moments from the whacked-out foreign exchange student. Very funny. It's a good teen party movie. Great cast including the two 80's brat pack members,amazing writing, funniest story line. It's one of those 80's hits you never grow tired of. I'll watch it again and again for years to come.",Sixteen Candles
174,melanievillalobosr,A waste of time,1,2 September 2018,"This movie is racist and sexist. I just watched it yesterday because in other two movies the title came up, so I felt curious and I couldn't believe that somebody thought this movie was a good idea. It treats rape like it's nothing, because yes having sex with an unconscious girl is rape, then magically the girl felt in love with the guy, what?? and the lead exchange his girlfriend for other girl's underwear. WTF, how can a girl fall in love with Jake?! and the annoying stereotype of the chinese guy. I hated it. Don't waste your time.",Sixteen Candles

176,jssd,Classic 80's Brat Pack Movie!,10,18 September 2005,"What a great 80's classic. Well directed and filmed. From the subtle things like Long Duck Dong using a fork and spoon like chopsticks at dinner and Joan Cusack's facial expressions throughout the whole movie to the goofs like Jake's car being a stick at first then ending up a automatic after the wedding. Classic ""Brat Pack"". If you like the great casting in this movie (it was nominated for a casting award0 then you need to check out ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""St. Elmo's Fire"". These movies hit on every 80's kid's worries and dealings in life. I think that a lot of what is talked about is still very true today in High School. Thanks for the memories...",Sixteen Candles
