0,TheLittleSongbird,"Bigger, bolder, darker and...better!",9,11 August 2014,"This is in no way a knock on the first Thor because I enjoyed it a lot, but, as said with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Thor: The Dark World impressed me more. The look of the film is wonderful, Asgard is just as colourful as it was in Thor yet also darker too, matching the darker, bolder tone very well. The photography and editing are stylish and the locations, especially Iceland, are stunningly vivid. The special effects are even more dazzling than in Thor and the same can be said for the stunts. The music score by Brian Taylor is dynamic and never repetitive or pedestrian, adding to the action sequences rather than detracting. Speaking of the action sequences, they are packed with thrills with battles almost on scale of Lord of the Rings and smack-downs that are enough to crush the bones. But Thor: The Dark World is not just about action and spectacle, it has substance too(or at least it did to me), laden with humour that will genuinely make you laugh but doing so without over-powering the dark nature of the story or the tense sparring between Thor and Loki. The story is compelling with the right doses of action, humour and drama, it's bigger in scale and bolder in tone than the first Thor but also more expansive in characterisation. The acting is top-class with most of the cast getting more to do, Anthony Hopkins is always dependable and Natalie Portman brings a touch of class and Stellan Skarsgard has some very funny moments but the acting honours do go to Chris Hemsworth, who's more robust and poised than he was in the first Thor, and especially Tom Hiddleston, who is terrific as Loki and pitches his mellifluousness and serpentine-like malevolence perfectly. My only complaints here are Christopher Eccleston having very little to do so he gives a somewhat one-dimensional performance that exudes moody menace but not much else and Loki surrendering and Thor forgiving him too easily and quickly. All in all however, a truly excellent follow-up that improves even more over the first Thor. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Thor - The Dark World
1,Leofwine_draca,Not bad at all,6,12 August 2017,"Although it's a film that many have criticised for having the most ordinary plot imaginable, I found THOR: THE DARK WORLD to be a fairly entertaining film and not deserving of all the criticism. Yes, the plot is predictable and some of the surprise plot twists are anything but, but this is the kind of film that holds the attention through spectacle and effect alone.Thor and his buddies once again have to team up and go into action, this time against a new menace, led by the singularly unremarkable Christopher Eccleston. Natalie Portman is back, unfortunately, as is her grating comic sidekick, but at least Stellan Skarsgard is around to add a bit of whimsy to the cast. Fan favourite Tom Hiddleston returns, of course, but he still doesn't really appeal to me; I just can't see what all the fuss is about. Chris Hemsworth is better as the dependable hero of the hour. The CGI effects are decent and the climax suitably imaginative, an inter-dimensional fight scene seemingly inspired by Wes Craven's SHOCKER. THE DARK WORLD isn't going to win awards, but it's watchable all the same.",Thor - The Dark World
2,SnoopyStyle,great fun and exciting superhero movie,8,24 August 2014,"Dark Elves are an ancient nemesis to Asgard. Their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) tried to use Aether to send the universe into darkness. In a great battle, the Dark Elves were routed, Malekith managed to escape and Asgard buried the Aether beyond use. It's many years later in the present day. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is imprisoned. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is fighting to bring order back to the nine realms. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is alone on Earth since Thor left her in New Mexico 2 years ago. She's now in London with her intern Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) who in turns has her own intern. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) has gone a little crazy and very naked. Jane is doing research on an anomaly which Asgard and the Dark Elves call Convergence. She gets sent through a wormhole to Svartalfheim where she's impregnated with all the Aether. Thor brings Jane back to Asgard despite Odin (Anthony Hopkins)'s disapproval.This is a lighter and jokier affair. Its broad jokes delivered mostly by Kat Dennings playing the traditional best friend rom-com role to Natalie Portman. Portman continues to be a weak point in this franchise. It's more her Jane Foster character who really lacks consistent chemistry and reason for their love affair. This is a love that spans the universe and I can't explain it other than they're both played by really gorgeous human specimens.The best parts are that the world of Asgard is expanded more. It's not just a set but a real place now. The movie gives a real sense of it. Also Thor and Loki expands their relationship. Their brotherly rivalry is deeper this time and Loki is set to become a big Marvel character in the future. Malekith is a slight disappointment as the villain. Quite frankly, all the usual fun villainy characteristics are given to Loki while Malekith is merely a one dimensional plot device. Malekith is really only a secondary character and maybe that's a good thing. The battles are great. The final battle is thrilling with a lot of fun. That's how I would describe the movie as a whole.",Thor - The Dark World
3,Hitchcoc,Superior Fun,9,3 December 2013,"Chris Hemsworth again becomes the focus of the Marvel saga. This is a delightful feast for the eyes and a masterful story. I'm an old guy and my tastes run all over the place, but I was taken in from he start As I've said before, people are taking their times with these films, not throwing out some cheap sequel to get a quick buck. Once again the setup is very well done. Loki is in prison in what looks like the city zoo. He rests in squalor, waiting his turn to return to power. He is a master of misdirection and disguise, so we never know when we can trust him. The answer, of course, is never. Still, for me, he is the most engaging of all the characters. He is a perpetual thorn in the side of everyone. He is the incarnation of the true Norse character, the trickster. The plot is really interesting. Ultimately, we must get to earth because all the adventure above the ground becomes a bit distant to us mortals. The researchers, including Natalie Portman's character (who has fallen big time for Thor and he for her), continue to try to figure out a way to understand the workings of this netherworld. An array of fun characters, most carried over from the first film as well as the Avengers, parry and thrust their way. Despite the grave consequences of their actions and those of the gods, there is a great deal of tongue in cheek humor and surprising twists that make it more than a bunch of characters trying to beat each other to a pulp. This is a very engaging film.",Thor - The Dark World
4,Prismark10,Thor and Loki show,5,25 March 2014,"With the main Marvel players established as film franchises. Marvel turned to their second tier with Thor and Captain America, if their desire to make the Avengers film was to become a real possibility.Kenneth Branagh was entrusted to get Thor of the ground. The Shakespearean actor and director was a left field choice that turned out to be an inspired and bold move.Now with the sequel, we go back to the land of Tolkienism with elves and the age of darkness. Before the reign of 'Odin' (Anthony Hopkins) the Dark Elves were led by 'Malekith' (Christopher Eccleston) who craved the energy source called 'Aether.'Although Malkieth was initially unsuccessful a rare convergence means he can begin his task again to grab this energy source so he can destroy once again.It is up to Thor to stop him and he might need to get Loki to assist him. The action moves from Asgard to Greenwich which seems the London location of choice for many US blockbusters in the last few years. Loki making his third appearance in a Marvel film get the best lines, Eccleston the actor responsible for the relaunch of Doctor Who gets little to do or show his skill because Loki has all the focus.The film despite its action, special effects and CGI is just average. Entertaining but instantly forgettable, but the film leaves you with a set up for a third film because even Norse legend/superheros can be dumb by trusting any stranger with there powerful artefacts.",Thor - The Dark World
5,claudio_carvalho,"The Aether, the Dark Elves and Loki",8,9 February 2014,"Odin (Anthony Hopkins) recalls when his father Bor and the warriors from Asgard vanquished the evil Dark Elves and their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) that wanted to send the universe into the darkness during the convergence of nine realms unleashing the powerful weapon Aether. Mallekith escapes and Bor hides the Aether in-between two stone columns.In the present days, on Earth, the scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) that is waiting for the return of Thor, investigates a gravity phenomenon in an abandoned factory with her assistant and her intern. She finds the column where the Aether is hidden and the substance possesses her. In Asgard, Heimdall (Idris Elba) reports to Thor (Chris Hemsworth) that Jane has disappeared. Thor returns to Earth and finds Jane; but when he sees that he has a strange energy protecting her, he brings Jane to Asgard to be healed. However, Malekith also awakes and goes to Asgard to retrieve the Aether. After a bloody battle, Frigga (Rene Russo) is murdered by Malekith and Thor proposes treason to his warriors friends of Asgard and teams up with Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to seek revenge for the murder of their mother and to vanquish Malekith before he destroys Asgard with his Dark Elves. ""Thor: The Dark World"" is another great adventure of Thor. In this movie, Thor makes the most unlike association with Loki and the result is a wonderful movie. The scene of Loki fighting with Thor is the best moment of ""Thor: The Dark World"". Chris Hemsworth perfectly impersonates Thor and the conclusion surprises. Last but not the least, the movie is to be watched until the very end of the credits because there are two additional scenes in the credits. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Thor: O Mundo Sombrio"" (""Thor: The Dark World"")",Thor - The Dark World
6,nogodnomasters,THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY,8,23 June 2019,"Natalie Portman starts out the film as an astrophysicist in the New Mexico desert. There appears to be some kind of UFO crash, as apparently aliens have the ability to fly all over the planet without crashing, except New Mexico. The movie then flashes back to 985 AD in a heavily CG background as Asgard, led by Odin, aka Anthony Hopkins, is fighting the frost giants, who look like blue skinned versions of Freddie Kruger. They end up with a truce. During the coronation ceremony of Thor, a frost giant enters the realm of Asgard and disrupts the ceremony (why this was done at the time was a mystery). Thor in his passion leads a group of warriors to the planet of the frost giants to teach them a lesson. The simple touch of a frost giant freezes the skin like liquid nitrogen. This was great in 2D, I can only imagine what the CG graphics was like in 3D.Odin is upset with Thor and takes his hammer and powers. He banishes Thor who speeds to earth only to crash into Natalie Portman and company in the desert (beginning scene). A bad hammer pun and a taser later, Thor is on his way to medical. The hammer lands elsewhere in the desert and is lodged like the Sword in the Stone. A group of yokels gather to have a cook out and attempt to remove said hammer. . . until the FEDS show up.The film moves back and forth between events on earth and in Asgard, as Loki has assumed the throne of his ailing father. In order to convince the audience this is the real Thor, he speaks a Middle Earth style of English, making over frequent use of the word ""realm."" It works well as it allows him to flirt with Natalie Portman, who he thinks is the most clever person on the planet. (Isn't this one of the seven signs?) Perhaps the movie's biggest fault is that is attempts to link mythology, science fiction and science fact is such a way a 9 year old might buy it.Like good trekkies, Thor's friends come to earth to rescue him, because the needs of the one out weigh the needs of the many. They show up and are as conspicuous as Vikings in a credit card commercial. Memorable line: Stop! You are using unregistered weapons technology!""For me the story wasn't light enough. There were a few comic lines attempted to break up the seriousness of the film, but it needed more of them. I was hoping for something along the lines of Iron Man 1. Perhaps the worst I have seen Ms. Portman in a while was her parsed OMG line. Other than that one bad line, she was great.No sex, no nudity, no f-bombs. Safe for the kiddies. They should love it.",Thor - The Dark World
7,nogodnomasters,I BETTER GET MY PANTS,8,23 June 2019,"The film opens with the defeat of Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) who wants to destroy the universe with darkness called ""the ether"" apparently a hater of the cinema. He is defeated and the ether is hidden somewhere deep where it can't be found. Then the movie title hits the screen: ""Thor: The Dark World."" Not too hard to figure this one out and since Natalie Portman doesn't work for bus fare, you can bet she will be prominent in the film.Chris Hemsworth provides us with some early beefcake moments for what is a borderline chick flick. I found Darcy (Kat Dennings) to be the most entertaining character in the film, too bad she was underutilized. The film excelled in special effects, but had a plot we could figure out before the title flashed on the screen, minus some details. Thor was played rather stiffly and made Loki (Tom Hiddleston) likeable. The writers need to lighten him up.Worth a view on the big screen. We will all add this to our growing Avengers' collection, although I might wait for a price drop on this one.",Thor - The Dark World
8,kosmasp,Mirror,8,2 June 2014,"While this is a continuation and some people might eventually get fed up with all the superhero movies, this really is a nice follow up, not only to the Avengers, but especially to the first Thor. Whereas you had Thor as fish out of water in that one, this time around someone else takes over that department.It's also very nice to see Natalie Portman back again, her missing out on the Avengers. There is always some reason why the other Avengers are not present and I guess you could question that, but you would take a lot from your own movie watching experience if you did. Plus you have enough on your plate here (or on your screen to be exact), that holds your attention. The mood and the fine line this walks (fantasy and comedy) continues, even though the reigns were handed from Branagh to a Game of Thrones director. Good choice it seems ...",Thor - The Dark World
9,classicsoncall,"""I'd rather be a good man than a good king"".",7,7 December 2014,"The film overall has it's fair share of holy s**t moments that defy all levels of credibility, even for a comic book/sci-fi/fantasy movie. That whole business about the Aether winding up in Natalie Portman's body was just a little too much to wrap my head around, especially after it was assured that the heroes of Asgard buried it so deeply to avoid detection by the Dark Elves.Probably the best way to approach this film is to just sit back and get transported between the realms of Earth and Asgard without thinking too much about it. As an actioner there's plenty of it. As a story, there's just too much going on with events seemingly occurring because they were written that way instead of there being a rationale for them. I mean, one minute Thor's hand is cut off and then it's back again - wait a minute, what!? And with the emphasis on the Dark Elves I found a lot of Asgard suspiciously resembling places seen before in Rivendell. If there's going to be a Thor III, maybe a little more thought needs to go into it.",Thor - The Dark World
10,gavin6942,A Weak Point in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,6,1 September 2014,"When Thor's love interest gets cursed with a powerful object, Thor must protect her before an army and its ruthless leader try to get their hands on it to take over the remains of Earth.The strong points of this film are the continuing development of Loki as a villain (and perhaps a hero), Stellan Skarsgard, and Kat Dennings. The weak points are the over use of CGI, the use of Natalie Portman and the general way that Thor does not seem to fit in with the rest of the Marvel universe (even with the vague connection to ""Guardians of the Galaxy"").Not that this was a bad film, but it was probably the weakest in the series thus far, and there should be no surprise if we never see a ""Thor III"".",Thor - The Dark World
11,jboothmillard,Thor: The Dark World,8,3 December 2013,"The first Thor film based on the popular Marvel comics, directed by Kenneth Branagh, was a good watch, and I was looking forward to seeing this sequel, not just because it looked really good, but it was also a continuation and crossover of the Avengers Assemble plot. Basically thousands of years ago Bor (Tony Curran), the father of Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins), fought in the great war between the Dark Elf Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) who wants to destroy the universe with the weapon called the Aether, they are defeated, the Aether is hidden somewhere in a stone column, and while imprisoned Malekith, his lieutenant Algrim (Lost's Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and other Dark Elves escape in suspended animation. In the present day on Asgard, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is being imprisoned for his war crimes on Earth, there is a possibility that Thor (Chris Hemsworth) will take over the throne from his father Odin, meanwhile on Earth in London astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her former intern Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), who herself has intern Ian Boothby (Jonathan Howard), are investigating unearthly things. In abandoned warehouse Jane, Darcy and Ian find an invisible portal that makes things disappear into thin air, sometimes coming back and going through again, sometimes not, then all of the sudden Jane is teleported to another world, and there she finds the stone containing the Aether, which infects her, and she returns to Earth unaware of what has happened. Back in Asgard a rare alignment of the Nine Realms is imminent, it also means portals to the other worlds appear at random, Thor is told by Heimdall (Idris Elba) that Jane disappeared, he goes to Earth to see she is safe, he takes her to his home world to see healers, they do not know how to treat her, Odin warns that the infection of the Aether will eventually kill her, and that its return means a prophecised catastrophe. The Aether release has awakened Malekith, and he and his group make an attack Asgard, and during the battle Thor and Loki's mother Frigga (Rene Russo) is killed, Odin orders Thor to do nothing, but against his father's wishes he releases his malevolent brother, as he knows Malekith's secret portal, they will attempt to use Jane to lure and confront him, and he makes a deal that Loki can have revenge for the death of their mother. Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Sif (Jaimie Alexander) and Fandral (Zachary Levi) assist their getaway and escape from the Asgardian soldiers, they commandeer a Dark Elf spaceship and with Jane transport to Svartalfheim, once there they eventually find Malekith, Loki tricks him into removing the Aether from inside Jane and absorb it himself, Thor fails to destroy it before it enters the enemy's body, and Loki appears mortally wounded in a short fight, before he apparently dies Thor promises his brother he will tell of his sacrifice. Thor and Jane find another portal, the same that took her from Earth to the stone, so they teleport back to Earth and reunite with Darcy, Ian and Jane's mentor Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), who recently came out from an institution following a breakdown after the New York attacks, they work out that Melekith will attempt to destroy the universe in the centre of the Convergence, in Greenwich. The Dark Elves spaceship crashes through the city square, and Malekith and Thor battle going though the various portals, Thor's hammer going back and forth to find him, finally Malekith is transported to Svartalfheim before he can destroy the universe, the spaceship collapsing to the ground is transported too, and he is killed crushed by it, the Earth is safe. In the end Thor is asked by Odin to take his place as king of Asgard, he declines and tells of Loki's sacrifice, and when he walks away Odin turn out to be the living Loki in disguise, and in the mid- credits a villain called The Collector (Benicio Del Toro) is given the Aether by Volstagg and Sif to look after, it is obvious from his final words that he has other things to collect for an evil plot. Also starring Tadanobu Asano as Hogun, Clive Russell as Tyr, Chris O'Dowd as Richard, Chris Evans as Captain America, Talulah Riley as Nurse, Alice Krige as Eir Stan Lee as Patient. Hemsworth once again is great as the strong willed and heroic warrior, Portman is still sweet as the hero's love interest, Ecceleston is almost unrecognisable with his deep voice and makeup and makes a menacing presence, Hiddleston is still lovably malevolent and snide with his quips, and Hopkins in his time brings his usual good seriousness. The story is a little technological and bolder than the previous fantasy film, with much more being destroyed and many more battles on Earth and in outer space, so plenty of great special effects to create the spectacle, its interesting to see it going on in Great Britain in an American made film, and you feel the doom and gloom moments too, all this combines to make a much better than the first, highly entertaining and exciting action adventure film. Very good!",Thor - The Dark World
12,paul_haakonsen,Thor returns and hammers in great entertainment...,7,1 February 2014,"Normally not one to be keen on superhero movies, but still I do watch the movies for entertainment. And whereas the previous Thor movie was alright, then ""Thor: The Dark World"" does surpass the previous movie.Sure, the storyline is cliché and you see what's coming a mile away. But still, it works out, because this is generic to the core, but there is just something fundamentally entertaining about this classic good vs. evil storyline, where evil wants to lay waste to the universe, and a single force of heroic good-doers thwart the evil plans.The storyline in ""Thor: The Dark World"" is about an ancient race of dark elves, who according to Asgardian legend, are conquered and exist no more. Along with them is the Aether, a force so strong that it can lay waste to the universe. When Jane Foster (played by Natalie Portman) comes across a minor cosmic anomaly in her search for Thor, little does she know that she has stumbled upon the Aether and awoken it from its dormant stasis, and along with it the dark elves.As for the effects, then ""Thor: The Dark World"" does deliver right on the money. The CGI are awesome to behold and also very realistic, which just adds to the worth of the entire movie. Without proper effects, then a Marvel superhero movie would not work out on the same level.And as for the costumes, armors and creature designs. Well that just blew me away. There were so many awesome details and concept designs going on here that it was just mind boggling. Asgard is indeed a marvelous sight to behold, as are the armors of the Asgardian warriors. But the Kursed creatures that were with the dark elves, that was just beyond anything I have seen.It is nice to see people return to their previous roles, and even with a pinch of comedy as in where Loki portrays and makes fun of Captain America.If you enjoy these particular types of movies, then ""Thor: The Dark World"" is well worth watching. Great action and lots of adrenaline to keep you on your toes.",Thor - The Dark World
13,tavm,Thor: The Dark World is a fine sequel to its predecessor,9,19 November 2013,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. In my review of the previous Thor movie, I mentioned I fell asleep during some of it but managed to wake up during the really exciting parts. This time, I was alert the whole time and me and my friend were really into it this time! Thor and his evil brother Loki and mortal Jane Foster are back and better than ever! Oh, and I also was highly amused by Kat Dennings as Darcy. This was exciting enough from beginning to end with spectacular sequences during the last 40 minutes. I don't really feel like mentioning the plot, just watch this if you love Marvel Comics lore. And, oh, if you watch the new series ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D"", this movie is a tie-in to tonight's episode so that's a high recommendation to see Thor: The Dark World.",Thor - The Dark World
14,utgard14,Mixed thoughts from someone who loved the first film,6,13 February 2014,"A few complaints before I address what worked for me. While I enjoyed it, I felt it didn't have quite the ""wow"" factor the first film had. The mood throughout is somber, both in look and feel, with the occasional bit of humor (mostly from Kat Dennings). The story is more complex and I'm not of the camp that feels that is always a good thing. Once again, the cast is great although it seems the supporting characters like Sif and The Warriors Three are largely wasted. Odin is especially pompous and unbearable this time around. When you have Thor having to counsel his father on peace not war, it feels at times like this isn't even the same Odin from the first film. Obviously the sci-fi gobbledygook elements will please many. I'm referring to the Aether nonsense and everything surrounding it. It's one of those ""shut your brain off to enjoy it"" moments for me. Also, Loki's trick of using illusions or impersonating people was used way too much. It made the last time he uses it in the film less effective. The villain Malekith is uncharismatic and, frankly, dull. Finally, the look of the film wasn't my favorite. This is just a stylistic preference but I felt it was too ""Lord of the Rings"". Everything was muted colors and kind of depressing. The first film was much brighter and felt like more of a superhero movie. Stick with what has worked for you, Marvel. Let DC make their dour superhero films. Keep it bright.OK, now you read all that and you probably wonder how I can say I still enjoyed the film. Well, I loved the performances from Hemsworth and Hiddleston. I also liked Kat Dennings and appreciated how she lightened things up. Natalie Portman had way more to do than the first film and was enjoyable and pretty as usual. While I said I didn't care for the overall dark look of the film, I did admire the special effects. They were very well done, save for the opening scene which was a little too fake with obvious CGI soldiers. Ultimately, I enjoyed it enough but it wasn't one of my favorite Marvel films. Thor is my favorite Marvel superhero and I loved the first movie. I realize a lot of fans are rabid about these films and have a ""you either love it or hate it"" mentality but I'm in the middle. I liked it but I didn't love it.",Thor - The Dark World
15,zardoz-13,"""Thor 2"" Will Floor You!!!",8,11 November 2013,"Chris Hemsworth wields his mighty hammer Mjölnir for the second time as the brawny Norse deity in ""Game of Thrones"" director Alan Taylor's ""Thor: The Dark World."" Happily, virtually everybody from director Kenneth Branagh's immaculate but lackluster predecessor reprises their respective roles. ""Thor: The Dark World"" boasts a sufficiently complex plot with more than enough grandiose escapades intermingled with amusing antics to keep you distracted throughout its swiftly-paced 112 minutes. The first ""Thor"" came up short on spectacle and surprises, but the sequel delivers several bolts from the blue that keep its outlandish but formulaic shenanigans invigorating. Charismatic performances from the brawny, blond Hemsworth; the brainy, brunette Natalie Portman; the maniacal Christopher Eccleston; and the treacherous Tom Hiddleston enliven this imaginative Marvel Comics entry. Not only does ""Thor: The Dark World"" surpass its humdrum 'origins' predecessor, but it also picks up the saga where the superlative""Avengers"" left off. Indeed, some things haven't changed. Odin isn't entirely pleased with his son's rebellious behavior, and their troubled relationship puts our hero at odds with his one-eyed father. Despite Odin's stern objections, Thor rekindles his romance with astrophysicist Jane Foster after a two year absence. Eventually, Thor tangles with a sinister army of Dark Elves and their ultimate doomsday weapon that threatens to obliterate not only Earth but also the Nine Realms of the Universe. No, ""Thor: The Dark World"" isn't quite as entertaining overall as either ""The Avengers"" or ""Iron Man 3."" Nevertheless, Taylor and scenarists Christopher Yost, Christopher Markus, and Stephen McFeely, working from a story by Don Payne and Robert Rodat, manage to mobilize enough machismo, mayhem, and self-mockery to make it worth watching more than once. ""Thor: The Dark World"" unfolds centuries before Odin (Anthony Hopkins of ""Hannibal"") entrusted the legendary hammer to his impetuous son Thor. According to Odin, Thor's grandfather Bor invaded Alfheim with an army of Asgard warriors and routed the rodent-faced legion of Dark Elves in a pitched battle. The leader of the Elves, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston of the BBC's ""Dr. Who"" television series), had sought to use a doomsday weapon called the Aether. This Aether resembles a red and black confetti-like substance that swirls ominously in the air. Bor trapped the Aether and buried it in the ground. Several millenniums later, Thor's old flame Jane Foster (Natalie Portman of ""Black Swam"") discovers a portal between London, England and the Dark World. Unfortunately, the Aether infects Jane. Thor comes to Jane's rescue and ushers her to Asgard for treatment. Initially, Odin is far from ecstatic about this turn of events. Actually, Thor's father believes his son should stick to his own kind. He urges Thor to take Sif (Jaimie Alexander of ""The Last Stand"") as his bride. The Dark Elves launch their own invasion of Asgard, and one of its most prominent residents dies during the onslaught. Reluctantly, Thor recruits his two-timing, half-brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston of ""War Horse"") to help him. Meantime, Malekith unleashes mass destruction on London as our heroes scramble to save the day.You really cannot fault the writing in ""Thor: The Dark World."" The capable scenarists know their subject matter. Christopher Yost has penned several episodes of various Marvel television series, including ""Wolverine and the X-Men,"" ""Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes,"" and ""Iron Man: Armored Adventures."" Similarly, Markus and Stephen McFeely collaborated on both ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" and its sequel ""Captain America: Winter Soldier."" Taylor and his writers take Thor and company on some adrenaline, roller-coaster rides that include jaunts through wormholes in time as well as one adrenaline-laced aerial pursuit in a huge, T-shaped, flying aircraft and later in a boat that cruises on the wind. Taylor choreographs several epic combat sequences that shun blood, sweat and tears, but keep you shadow boxing with our heroes. Naturally, our heroes survive by the skin of their teeth. The malevolent Dark Elves appear quite sinister with their pale, cadaverous masks and their minions look equally intimidating in appearance and number. They possess a Darth Vader quality and are determined to triumph over Thor and company. Twice as visually stunning as the resplendent original was, ""Thor: The Dark World"" pits our protagonists against some supernatural opponents, such as a gargantuan creature made up of stones and a gigantic beast that resembles a hybrid of a bull and a hippopotamus. Taylor and company lighten up the slam-bang action heroics with clever humor that enables you to laugh when you aren't flinching at all the acrobatic fisticuffs. Hemsworth uses Mjölnir with the ease of and hurls it like a boomerang during some scenes. Thor's quartet of faithful brethren, Sif (Jaimie Alexander), Fandral (Zachary Levi), Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), and Hugan (Tadanobu Asano), have developed a camaraderie that is displayed in the way that Taylor stages their action scenes. They keep tabs on each other in the midst of all the chaos and often save each other from certain death.Performances are robust with each character getting a moment or two to radiate their personality, particularly Anthony Hopkins, Stellan Skarsgård, Kat Dennings, and Natalie Portman. Audiences should know that the film doesn't grind to a complete halt when the end-credits roll. Two scenes ensue at different intervals and furnish foreshadowing as well as closure and comedy. One prominent S.H.I.E.L.D. agent whose own sequel is scheduled for a Spring 2014 release appears briefly in a side-splitting cameo. Naturally, Marvel Comics co-creator Stan Lee shows up in one scene and blurts an uproarious line. This ""Thor"" will floor you!",Thor - The Dark World
16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Cornucopia,8,1 November 2013,"It's been a year since the events of The Avengers. Bifrost has been rebuilt, and the Aesir are only now done world policing the other realms back to peace. Things won't remain quiet for long - a primeval race, the Dark Elves, return, determined to bring all of existence back to the nothingness before there was light. An oft-used, abstract ""villain goal"" - here visualized well, and made quite literal; part of their arsenal(the only advanced weapon in this that isn't so bland that it's downright distracting) is a grenade that creates a tiny black hole, relentlessly pulling away those caught within the blast radius. To this end, the leader Malekith(Eccleston bringing out the big guns for the least compelling bad guy of the current cinematic Marvel-verse), with the aid of his lieutenant, Algrim(Akinnuoye-Agbaje, using his immense physical presence to bring a seemingly unstoppable force of destruction to life - a lava-infused bull-like being), seek the Aether, a powerful essence that enables the wielder to drain life and light.It has recently resurfaced - in fact, it infected Jane Foster(Portman, cute in her awkward social behavior and obsession with discovery; she and our titular hero are pining for one another - with that said, the romance was better in the first one). This makes her a target, and the Asgardians find that their old foe is extremely dangerous. The only way to save the universe(can you say ""raised stakes""?) appears to be for Thor(Hemsworth, charming, strong and, yes, arrogant - but now with an appreciation of planning and not rushing in) forming an uneasy alliance with Loki(Hiddleston at his most duplicitous, unpredictable... and vulnerable; in short, his best yet), who now faces consequences for his actions, and the two will come head to head over their on-going conflict - in general, this takes care to follow up on what has happened to these characters(in part by trimming the large cast some, not introducing many new faces, and, yes, less overall development for them) so far, a surprisingly personal story in this adventure of an epic scale.As this flies by with a pace that never overwhelms in spite of opening the until-now-only-ajar door to the vastness of space, the comic relief jokes and gags come in a steady stream, with the ""Terminator 2"" style humor - easing the otherwise heavy and bleak subjects, without becoming, well, T3, a parody. There is a ton of action(another of the many improvements on the great Branagh film), and it's much more varied - not merely(which doesn't mean they're gone) deities fighting creatures, we now have mid-air combat, jet fighters, chase sequences, even a major attack on a fortress! Aiming for Star Wars, this shows us more of the galaxy, defining the various areas as unique from one another. The grand orchestral score aids this tremendously, as does location shooting, solid FX work including prosthetics - with practical, suits and the like favored over CG. We go on an adventure - away from that which is familiar to either us or the protagonists. The plot is easy to follow, yet with good twists, and everything is properly set up and pays off.There is a lot of disturbing content, some mild violence and a little moderate language in this. I recommend this to any fan of fantasy, graphic novels and/or Nordic mythology. 8/10",Thor - The Dark World

(Cameos: Chris Evans, Stan Lee & Benicio Del Toro) Better-than-anticipated follow-up to the Marvel Comics big-screen adaptation of the Norse god cum superhero with the Teutonic hammersmith (Hemsworth reprising his iconic role) attempting to stop an evasive war between his world of Asgard by a vengeful elf (Eccleston under tons of prosthetic make-up) and Earth while still protecting his amour, physicist Portman. While the subcommittee of its screenplay (5 scribes are attributed) tends to get long-winded in the mythos of the sci-fi fantasy (and a wonky life-force that looks like a spilling of merlot!) the direction by Alan Taylor (and James Gunn, uncredited for the wait-to- the-end-credits-sneak-peak of the next installment) moves along and a sprinkling of humor is welcome amidst the over-the-top digital effects.

18,Uriah43,Plenty of Action and Humor Throughout,7,16 March 2014,"Before the reign of ""Odin"" (Anthony Hopkins) the Dark Elves were led by a malicious being known as ""Malekith"" (Christopher Eccleston) who craved an extremely powerful energy source known as the ""Aether"". In his attempt to get it (in order to destroy the universe) war broke out between the Dark Elves and Aasgard which ended up in the Dark Elves being annihilated and the Aether buried forever. Or so everybody thought. As it so happens Malekith managed to escape and due to a rare convergence of the realms the Aether has become uncovered. And Malekith wants it badly. The only problem is that ""Jane Foster"" (Natalie Portman) has not only discovered it but it has also infected her very soul. Recognizing Jane's serious plight Thor takes her to Aasgard for medical care. So in order for Malekith to acquire the Aether he now has to battle all of Aasgard in the process. Anyway, rather than detail the entire story and risk spoiling the picture for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a very good movie which had plenty of action and humor throughout. In all honesty though I thought there were some parts which seemed to drag a bit while other parts went overboard with the graphic action. In any case, this was quite enjoyable and I rate it as above average.",Thor - The Dark World
19,ferguson-6,Loki Rules,6,12 November 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. While this is the second Thor movie, we feel a bit more familiar with the Norse God thanks to The Avengers. It's not surprising that Chris Hemsworth can hold his own with the character given his looks and physicality, but this time he gets a run for his money thanks to Tom Hiddleston as Loki.The film's real villain is Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) who rules the Dark Elves and is trying to re-capture the all-powerful Aether, a substance of infinite energy. But the whole battle for the 9 realms is really just a sideline to Thor vs Loki, and Thor's touch of humanity and eye for Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). Most of the key characters are back: Anthony Hopkins as Odin (even more over the top this time), Rene Russo (Thor's mom), Ray Stevenson as Volstagg, Jaimie Alexander (Sif), Idris Elba (Heimdall), Kat Dennings (Darcy), and Stellan Skarsgard (Erik Selvig).This sequel is kind of interesting to analyze. It's certainly bigger than the original ... the special effects are huge and much improved. Light comic moments abound, but luckily the snark from Kat Dennings is minimal. Chris O'Dowd shows up for a couple of pretty funny, but slightly out of place scenes. There are a couple of cameos including an off-beat appearance by one of the The Avengers. Rene Russo even gets her own sword fight! Though it matters not to me, I assume there are many who would choose a Skarsgard other than Stellan to run around Stonehenge sans clothes. So while it has all of that going for it, the story is certainly fails at engaging the audience.This one is directed by Alan Taylor, who is quite a successful TV director, and there was clearly some upfront concern over the script as Joss Whedon was brought in for scene doctoring. I believe what we learn is that the fish out of water story works when Thor is on Earth, but it loses impact when Jane Foster visits Asgard. Still, Tom Hiddleston is such fun to watch as Loki, that none of that really matters.It's a superhero movie that will entertain the fans and provide plenty of ammunition for the critics looking to bash. If you see it in the theatre, you should know to stay for BOTH post-movie scenes. A rare Benecio Del Toro sighting makes it worthwhile.",Thor - The Dark World
20,morrison-dylan-fan,The Thor Saga-Part 2:The Dark World.,6,18 October 2020,"After being shocked by how much writer/director Shane Black was able to mark his unique style on the gripping Iron Man 3 (2013-also reviewed) I took a look at what was the next one of the ten MCU titles I've yet to see. Having found Thor (2011-also reviewed) to be a fun,colourful flick,I got set to enter the dark world.View on the film:Stating later that the changes Disney made to the film in post-production was something he ""(hoped) never to repeat, and (doesn't) wish upon anybody else."" after he had replaced Kenneth Branagh, who turned down making the sequel due to disagreements with the studio over the original film, the ability of director Alan Taylor to build the impression of a vast canvas during the early years of Game of Thrones, is sadly lost in his first directed film since Kill The Poor (2003).Joined by regular Game of Thrones cinematographer Kramer Morgenthau, Taylor's attempt to give Asgard in this movie to have a more natural look, sadly ends in a grey mash, due to the pulpy Comic-Book colours being replaced for a dull green which causes the baddies to blend into the background.Unlike in his GoT credits, Taylor paints a odd small-scale atmosphere, with even the fights shot on the streets of London being presented in limited whip-pans which freeze from getting up-close to the action.Whilst not helped by gloomy Christopher Eccleston as the main baddie, who later said he felt during the whole production that it was ""Just a gun in your mouth."" (Odd how he kept so quiet until after the big bucks were in his bank account)Chris Hemsworth & Tom Hiddleston shine as Thor and Loki, with Thor's fish out of water status and Loki's evil cackling being bended here with a new sense of brotherly love.The last film he worked on before dying from bone cancer at age 48, returning Don Payne is here joined by regular MCU writers Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, and Saving Private Ryan writer Robert Rodat, all tied by Comic-Book writer Christopher L. Yost (excellent run on X-Force) for a screenplay that slickly brings cosmic elements into the MCU, as the Shakespearean Rock-Opera of the first is replaced by a snappy hard-knocks fight with the Dark Elves,as Thor enters the dark world.",Thor - The Dark World
21,FlashCallahan,Its a different world...,3,3 November 2013,"Following on from the events of the Avengers movie, Thor is back in Asgard, delivering Loki, who is damned to spend an eternity in the Asgardian dungeons.Jane is in London, still pining for the titular character, as she hasn't seen him for two years, but still holding out for him.But there is a new threat from the dark elves. They seek an elixir type essence that will cause darkness amongst the nine realms.Jane however has found a portal into one of the realms, and gets infected by the essence. Because the dark elves can trace this source, Thor rescues her and takes her back to Asgard, much to Odins dismay.But the elves plan an attack on Asgard, and after many lives are lost, Thor realises that only one person can help him, and he's damned for the rest of his life....The first movie was wonderful. Not only was it exciting and refreshing, but it was one of the funniest Marvel movies released yet. This however takes a huge step back, and really taints phase two of the Marvel releases.Hemsworth is as good as ever, as is Hiddleston, but apart from Portman, it appears that the rest of the cast have been sidelined, so Thor and Loki can carry on their war of nerves.It's also very convoluted, narrative is lost as there is so much going on, and by the end of it all, you wondered what on earth went on, an also what happened to a few of the characters, there are plot holes aplenty.The humour what was wonderful in the first movie, feels really forced in this, and instead of causing unexpected laughter, had me rolling my eyes as to how silly it felt. Dennings is a thorn in the movies side, she is a parody of her character from the first, and ruins every scene she is in.The best joke in the film, which was in the trailer, steals from Raiders of the Lost Ark anyway.Visuals are bland and boring, and Asgard feels like something from The Phantom Menace, combined with Flash Gordon, and the rest of the realms could have come from any Lord Of The Rings movie.Its a shame, because Marvel know they have a winning formula, but here it feels like they are just in it for the money, and all the cool references and a brilliant cameo, cannot save such a disappointment.Many will call it Thor-some and other play on word praises.But for me, and I really hate saying this because Hemsworth is really good, it's pretty Thor-ful.",Thor - The Dark World
22,Aaron1375,More Thor action this time around,9,31 December 2013,"I enjoyed the first Thor film more than I was expecting, but I enjoyed this one even more. This is probably due to the fact that Thor had all his godly powers throughout the entire film. In fact, the first film played out a lot like a second superhero film as many times in the sequel to a comic book character the superhero will lose his powers at some point. The second Superman with Christopher Reeves and Spider-man 2 are examples of this. This one simply had Thor with all his powers on display and more scenes in Asgard and a unique Earth setting of London rather than the standard New York that made me enjoy this one more the the previous film and a bit more than the third Ironman released earlier this year.The story has some strange race of beings called the Dark Elves being awoken by a strange event that could spell the end of all realms if the Dark Elves have their way. Thor's love interest Jane Foster, comes into contact with this strange power and is soon the target of Malekith, leader of the Dark Elves. Thor takes Jane to Asgard despite opposition from his father Odin, but this will prove a costly move as the elves invade Asgard. Soon Thor must work with his brother Loki to lure the elves into a trap and save not only Earth and Asgard, but all realms in the universe.Once again the action is great this time and there is a lot more of it. My favorite parts though involved the scenes with Loki and Thor's uneasy alliance. This was interesting and funny at the same time. Anthony Hopkins returns as Odin and does a superb job as he usually does and Jane Foster's friends return in this one too, though with varying degrees of success as both are merely used for comic relief here.So, overall, I enjoyed this sequel more than the first film. I liked the action, Thor and Loki's interactions and the settings and look of the film. There is also sure to be a sequel considering how this one ended. There was an extra scene after a few credits role by, but it seemed so out of place from the rest of the film. I know it is a lead in for the Guardians of the Galaxy film, this is probably due to the fact I am just not really familiar with that particular comic franchise. All in all, it was nice to see a movie as there really was nothing I was really interested in seeing since July. I needed some filler as there may not be another film I want to see until next April! So nice comic action for the end of the year!",Thor - The Dark World
23,Wuchakk,Entertaining sequel brings Asgard to life,7,9 December 2016,"Released in 2013 and directed by Alan Taylor, ""Thor: The Dark World"" stars Chris Hemsworth in his second solo movie as the Thunder God. Natalie Portman returns as an astrophysicist and Thor's earth babe, Jane Porter, who's infected by an eerie otherworldly substance called aether. After Thor brings Jane to Asgard, war breaks out when the dark elf, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), comes for the powerful substance.The Thor comic was unique in that the stories regularly involved three realms: the mythical Asgard and neighboring areas, uncharted expanses across the universe, and Earth. I rarely appreciated the Asgardian segments, but I often enjoyed the many creative cosmic explorations and the Earth-centered stories. Like the first movie, this sequel is amazing in that it successfully recreates Asgard and its main characters for the screen, not to mention that it actually makes them interesting (I never found Odin, Sif or the Warrior's Three interesting).The bulk of the movie takes place on Asgard and the sci-fi effects are just mind-blowing; I particularly like Malekith's spacecrafts and the Asgardian ship-crafts. Thankfully, there are some Earth sequences, including the dynamic climax in London. Bottom Line: This is a thrilling sequel; if you like the first movie you'll appreciate this one too.ADDITIONAL CAST: Anthony Hopkins appears as Odin, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Rene Russo as Frigga, Idris Elba as Heimdall, Jaimie Alexander as Sif, Zachary Levi as Fandral, Ray Stevenson as Volstaag, Tadanobu Asano as Hogan, Kat Dennings as Darcy and Stellan Skarsgård as Eric.The movie runs 112 minutes and was shot in England and Iceland, with additional studio work done in Manhattan Beach, California.GRADE: B+",Thor - The Dark World
24,gradyharp,"'Well done, you just decapitated your grandfather!'",4,1 April 2018,"Nine screenwriters assemble the dissociate jumbled element of this second installment in the THOR series (the first being directed by Kenneth Branagh and this one directed by Alan Taylor) and despite the presence of a very similar cast this version depends more on spectacular CGI effects than on acting. It is a movie for lovers of comic book tales and it just bounces between firestorm and dissolution of nine realms to London and back. The plot? This synopsis makes a little sense of it: ' Thousands of years ago, a race of beings known as Dark Elves tried to send the universe into darkness by using a weapon known as the Aether. Warriors from Asgard stop them but their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) escapes to wait for another opportunity. The warriors find the Aether and since it cannot be destroyed, they try to hide it. In the present day, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) awaits the return of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) although it has been two years since they last saw once another. In the meantime, Thor has been trying to bring peace to the nine realms. Jane discovers an anomaly similar to the one that brought Thor to Earth. She goes to investigate, finds a wormhole, and is sucked into it. Back on Asgard, Thor wishes to return to Earth but his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins) refuses to let him. Thor learns from Heimdall (Idris Elba), who can see into all of the realms, that Jane disappeared. Thor then returns to Earth just as Jane reappears. However, when some policemen try to arrest her, an unknown energy repulses them. Thor then brings Jane to Asgard to find out what happened to her. When the energy is released again, they discover that when Jane disappeared, she crossed paths with the Aether and it entered her. Malekith, upon sensing that the time to strike is now, seeks out the Aether. He attacks Asgard and Thor's mother Frigga (Rene Russo) is killed protecting Jane. Odin wants to keep Jane on Asgard so that Malekith will come. Thor disagrees with his plan, so with his cohorts, he decides to take Jane away. He enlists the aid of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Unfortunately, Loki's motivations remain unknown.' The other good folks on Asgard are portrayed by Jamie Alexander, Zachary Levi, Ray Stephenson, Tadanobu Asano, and the folk down on earth are Stellan Skarsgård, Kat Dennings, Jonathan Howard, and Chris O'Dowd. Oh and there is a cast a thousands of Asgardians and Dark Elves to tear up the screen. The real star is the team of CGI artists.For THOR addicts, this is an entertaining film. For others, not so much...",Thor - The Dark World
25,siderite,"I've got the aether, nothing can stop me now. Oh...",8,19 February 2014,"I can't lie, I enjoyed watching the film. The great special effects, especially at first when the dark elf (yeah, that happened) space shuttles attacked Asgaard, the ridiculously cool Idris Elba, Loki's tricks, Thor's pathetic heroism and Stellan's craziness, the native brutality that Eccleston can radiate with so much ease (screw Doctor Who, I'll just destroy everything, LOL!), they all had something to do with it.But the story was not good, there so many holes in it that Swiss cheese would laugh at it. I don't want to spoil the movie, but in retrospect, Odin's plan was a lot better than what Thor did, not to mention the effect it had in the end. Jane's character is a helpless damsel in distress, although considering the other protagonists, it actually made sense. Thor's friends started cool, but then they ended up less than support characters. Thor himself does nothing but speak with a really deep voice and look pretty. Odin seems fickle and mean, I guess being king of the universe does that to anyone. Renee Russo is a queen, her character made the most sense to me.If one character stole the spotlight, it had to be Idris Elba's. He freaking destroyed an invisible space shuttle by jumping on it and stabbing it! Thor just swung his phallic symbol around. It was nice to see science triumph (after all, it always does) but the mambo jumbo spear like thingies that detect and also cause stuff were really too much.Chris O'Dowd is in this film, too. He is right in his element, as Malekith wanted to restart the universe to fix things, as it were, but has a really small role. Benicio del Toro appears as the mysterious collector at the end (wait until after the first credits to see him). He looks really cool. And if we are to praise the support characters, Zachary Levi looked interesting as the calm gentlemanish swordsman with great skill. Perhaps an offshoot of Thor, featuring Thor's friends rather than himself, would be a good idea, no?Also, after all the credits there is a funny scene with the Gwoemul- like monster that people forgot on Earth. Yeah, kudos if you were wondering what happened to it in the end :)Bottom line: you can make a thousand How It Should Have Ended parodies after this film, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. It hurts to think of the exquisite beauty the graphics people created for a movie that had the story of a fairy tale book for three year olds and how much more coolness a great story would have gotten out of the film. Too bad three year olds seem to be a target demographic for the American film industry.

It does show some of the spirit of Stan Lee as he is on the crew that worked on this one.Overall a solid movie entry to the Thor series. It does has a talented cast - first movie I have seen Natalie Portman in since she turned 30. So far the maturity of the big 30 is holding up well on her.There is some very good things for Thor to build on here. While it is not perfect, it is solid. For anyone who left the theater early, better come back and check some very important scenes that happen during the credits.Anthony Hopkins once again adds another solid performance as Odin to his resume of films.The film does contain itself to about 2 hours which is great as some of these films get so wrapped up in action that they get boring when they go beyond that time and get boring.The settings are impressive, maybe even more so in 3D but I did not watch that version.

The chapter one THOR (2011, 5/10) and the mega-amalgam THE AVENGERS (2012, 5/10) didn't lure me into Thor's fan base, but this sequel does boost the franchise's morals by further intermingling the epic apocalypse between the vast Gods' realm and the puny but ego-maniacal earth, saw it in its over-charged 3D version (nearly impossible to find a 2D screening nearby), THOR: THE DARK WORLD is a massive crowd- pleaser, terrific art production and the trappings of a Marvel vehicle, shrewdly fictionalizes the love-and-hatred bromance between Thor and Loki, which is much hyped as the dominant draw for this action-packed escapade. There is darkness before the birth of the universe, so as to against the plot of Malekith (Eccleston) to utilize an amorphous weapon called Aether to set the universe back into pitch- blackness, Thor (Hemsworth) has to team up with Loki (Hiddleston) to rescue his earth girlfriend Jane (Portman) who has been infected by Aether and being pursed by Malekith and his toadies, notably, a mutated fiend Algrim (Akinnuoye-Agbaje). Whiling the most entertaining part comes the polarized tenors of the Asgard kingdom and the contemporary earth, one is solemn, majestic, atavistic and Shakespearean (thanks to Kenneth Branagh for setting the tone in THOR 2011) and the other (this time the locale is an overcast London) is glossy, modern, farcical and doomed to be pulverized. The spectacles are generally gratifying and on a par with the earlier IRON MAN 3 (2013, 6/10) to say the least. Wonderful comic relief from the earthbound trio, Dennings, Skarsgård and Howard plus a surprising cameo by O'Dowd. Hemsworth and Portman are predictably playing the hero and his fearless girlfriend-in-danger default while Hiddleston easily grabs all the attention by influencing meatier character development, more ambiguous in his stance and a timely twist in the end can suffice to ignite fans' passion to the next installment, or maybe a Loki-based spin- off which will be more intriguing and anti-trend in its own way. By any means it is a solid sequel which inherits the merits from its predecessor and put more verve into its gods vs. mortals contradiction, director Alan Taylor has well handled a hot potato, next step, sit and wait for CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER (2014) coming this upcoming April. ",Thor - The Dark World
29,KineticSeoul,A sequel just for the sake of a sequel,5,17 December 2013,"This is a very unpolished sequel that seems to have gotten made, because they wanted a sequel and more money for the studio (probably more about the money). I liked this less than the previous first installment and I am not even a fan of the first one. It has more action and special effects, but that doesn't make a superhero movie any better. It just wasn't interesting nor did it have anything for me to attach myself to. After few minutes in, I just wanted for the final action set pieces to come in (which is actually cleverly done) and be done with. I know humor isn't suppose to be the part that stands out in a superhero movie, but my goodness, the humor in this is just forced and awful. Some of the characters seem more annoying than beneficial to this movie as a whole and just seemed to be there, because they were in the previous movie in this franchise. This movie brings nothing new to the superhero genre, they had the mentality of ""if it works previously, why fix it?"" direction. It's like one of those video games that does well with the first installment, but does the same thing with the gameplay and everything for the next installment with a different story with just another different villain that is generic as it gets.5.9/10",Thor - The Dark World
30,OllieSuave-007,"More like a Star Wars retread, only with the Marvel label.",5,20 June 2016,"Following the fast-paced and adrenaline-pumping Marvel film Thor, this sequel pales in comparison. It features the return of super god Thor (Chris Hemsworth), who tries to save Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) after she gets cursed with a powerful entity known as the Aether. However, an evil race called the Dark Elves wants the Aether to conquer the universe.This movie was rather slow and at times, boring - just a lot of talk that really goes no where. The overdone special effects made the movie look like a Star Wars retread and a story appeared it couldn't make up its mind if it's a drama or comedy. At certain poignant moments, the characters didn't really show any emotion, with the plot not allowing time for the audience to generate any sympathy. And, much of the comedy were very corny and lame, making you not wanting to take this film seriously.Hemsworth and Portman still had some good chemistry and did their best in their acting with what they were provided. Thor's fellow warrior comrades, Sif (Jaimie Alexander), Fandral (Zachary Levi), Volstagg (Ray Stevenson) and Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) were great in the film, but sorely underused. I could have really done without the corny Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) and her clueless intern - really lame jokes and dialog offered by them, and they served no real purpose in the movie as a result from their dumb performances.There were dabs of exciting action scenes here and there, as well as a suspenseful plot point where Thor have to rely on his not-so-friendly brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) for help.

31,Hellmant,About as good as the original.,8,12 November 2013,"'THOR: THE DARK WORLD': Four Stars (Out of Five)Chris Hemsworth returns as the titular superhero in this sequel to 2011's hit Marvel Comics adaptation film 'THOR'. It's also the eighth movie in 'The Avengers' Marvel film franchise universe. Tom Hiddleston also returns as Thor's villainous brother Loki, Anthony Hopkins once again plays his father Odin and Natalie Portman returns as his earthling love interest Jane Foster. Idris Elba, Kat Dennings, Jaimie Alexander, Stellan Skarsgard, Ray Stevenson, Tadanobu Asano and Rene Russo all reprise their roles from the original film with newcomers Christopher Eccleston, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Jonathan Howard, Chris O'Dowd and Zachary Levi (now playing Fandral) all joining the cast. In this installment Thor must battle 'Dark Elves' trying to gain control of a powerful weapon known as the Aether, which would send the universe into total darkness. The story is irrelevant; the epic action, visuals and superhero spectacle (that fans expect from a Marvel's 'Avengers' film) is all there! Fans of the original won't be disappointed.Many years ago Odin's father Bor (Tony Curran) defeated the Dark Elves, as they tried to gain control of the Aether and destroy the universe. Bor hid the powerful weapon in a stone column but unknown to him the Dark Elves' leader Malekith (Eccleston), and his surviving followers, hid themselves in suspended animation. In present day Jane Foster (Portman) finds the Aether and is infected by it. When she disappears, for several hours, Thor (Hemsworth) returns to Earth to find her. He brings her back to Asgard with him, so his people can find out what happened to her, but Malekith and his Dark Elves army have awakened and soon attack Asgard looking for Jane and the Aether (once again). Thor must turn to his brother Loki (Hiddleston), who's now locked up for his crimes on Earth, for help. Like with a lot of big action movies (especially superhero films) the plot line is confusing and uninvolving but it doesn't really matter in a film like this. People come to see the characters and action and as long as a film like this is visually stunning and well cast (and some decent dialogue helps as well) then fans will be pleased. I think 'Thor' fans will definitely be pleased with this movie (I was). I'd say the movie is about as good as the original; it's grander in scale and a bit more epic but it also lacks some of the awe that made the first film so entertaining. Fans of the comic book will probably get more of a kick out of it (as they're more likely to follow what's going on and pick up on easter eggs); I have friends that read the 'Thor' comics that have really enjoyed both movies. I don't think it quite lives up to the best comic book films but it is better than most. Hemsworth and Hiddleston are once again both outstanding in their roles and Alan Taylor (the film's new director) does a decent job directing. Portman is once again underused (and she's really above roles like this) and the script (by Christopher Yost, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) is pretty routine but the movie still has plenty of what fans are looking for!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/jrx8UNvoGB0",Thor - The Dark World
32,thesar-2,Thortal: The Movie,4,9 November 2013,"When the character I was looking forward to seeing the least becomes the best of the bunch, I'm pleasantly surprised. And the second Loki was on the screen, I fell in love with him all over again.Thor: The Dark World also jumped leaps and bounds over its predecessor in regards to CGI and overall look. I actually laughed and shook my head a lot – at the original for its terrible CGI. During this one, I barely noticed a thing wrong with the presentation on screen and that's a good thing, since the first film's disastrous graphics were an incredible distraction.But, getting back to Loki, or who I like to refer to as: Loki Luthor, since he's in every Thor-appearance movie to date, and Lex Luthor was in 4 of 6 (if you don't count ""Lex Corp"" in the background of Man of Steel.) It was just overkill and lacked originality. Even though, he was one of the few bright spots here, in this Thor sequel, I might change my mind if he's, once again, in a third Thor movie, or heavens, The Avengers: Age of Ultron.Thor's sorta cleaning up the mess left by his brother in chains, Loki, when the incredibly long intro back-story kicks in, i.e. Thor's long-distance girlfriend, Jane, gets attacked by a ""Spawn from Hell."" Then, he sorta has to clean up that mess with the help from, yep, Loki and the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Leo and Jemma. Oh, wait, make that some characters from the original Thor and one failed comic relief dude.The story's a mess, barely coherent at times and hardly original, pacing and length had me squirming at times, the dialogue's barely acceptable – and the subtitles did nothing to cover up the bad script, the editing's way off and Chris Hemsworth all-but phoned in this Thor. But, dang, that all said, I had a much better time here than the first movie which was way more a mess. Here, in part two, while Anthony Hopkins, Renee Russ and even Natalie Portman did what they could and were entertaining, it was really Hiddleston's Loki that stole every scene and you could sense he was both the glue to the film and the most enthusiastic person to be in this movie.For the some parts, it was a fun and funny ride – I did laugh out loud a few times, only not at the movie, this time around, and it's entertaining for probably one viewing. Noting huge, but definitely a make-up for part one.* * * Final thoughts: I was told there were two ""extra, Marvel-sig"" endings during/following the end credits. Come on guys; the movie was long enough as it was and after the second of three endings, pending you're counting the real ending, was actually pretty lousy and not worth the 2 minute wait for that one. I did leave at that point since I knew there was a minimum of 10 more credit minutes. Lucky I did take off; I found out later that thee final ending was actually worse than the first two. Bah!",Thor - The Dark World
33,cherold,Enjoyable Action Romp,7,14 July 2014,"This movie improves on the last Thor film. It's nicely paced and has some excellent action scenes. In its eagerness to make clear to the audience that this is going to be a big action movie, the early part has a lot of chaotic noise to it, which is perhaps why the first scene I really liked was a peaceful one in an abandoned building. Once the movie caught me interest I stayed caught. The story is coherent without any instantly noticeable plot holes, which is about as much as you can hope for from the typical superhero movie, and there are some nice surprises and some good WOAH moments. Performances were good.It's certainly formulaic, but it uses that formula well.",Thor - The Dark World
34,bensonmum2,"""Well done, you just decapitated your grandfather!""",7,10 August 2017,"A powerful, ancient force known as the Aether is uncovered on Earth and finds its way into an unsuspecting host, Dr. Jane Foster. Thor takes Jane to Asgard for answers and help. Unbeknownst to anyone in Asgard (or in the rest of the Universe for that matter), the reemergence of the Aether has woken Malekith, a Dark Elf intent on gaining the Aether's power. He'll destroy all of Asgard if need be to get what he wants. As expected, it's up to Thor to save Jane, Asgard, and all of creation.Overall, Thor: The Dark World (or Thor 2 as I'll call it for the rest of this) is an entertaining film. It has a few problems that keep me from calling it one of Marvel's best, but it's not a bad movie. Despite most of what I'm about to write sounding negative, I'm rating Thor 2 a 7/10. I honestly like the movie.There are at least three things in Thor 2 that could have been better. First, the relationship between Jane and Thor has about as much life as a dead fish. There's no spark or chemistry that I could feel. It reminded me of another ill-fated on-screen romance featuring Natalie Portman - Padme and Anakin. The on-screen chemistry isn't helped by Portman's acting. It seemed obvious to me that Portman would have rather have been just about anywhere other than making another Thor movie. She looked disinterested in the whole thing. Second, the plot is thin and never really drew me in the way I'd hoped. Maybe others felt different, but it just didn't work on me. Maybe it was the villain that I didn't find engaging or Portman's off-putting performance or events I the movie that required huge amounts of exposition - whatever, the plot was a weak point for me. Third, Thor 2 could have been better with more Loki. For me, the highlight of both Thor movies has been Tom Hiddleston as Loki. He's so good. I'm not sure what kind of plot the MCU folks could come up with, but I would love to see a stand-alone Loki movie. How awesome would that be!",Thor - The Dark World

36,Robert_duder,Literally buries the first film and turns in one of the truly great sci-fi films of the year!,9,29 November 2013,"I am sort of a wishy washy fan of the Marvel films. So far they have ranged from decent to really good and The Avengers was definitely the height of that and so far the best...until now. It is ironic because I actually thought Thor was one of the weakest of the Marvel films. It didn't really impress me although in watching it again I liked it more the second time. But Thor: The Dark World is simply stunning. Everything about this film works. It absolutely felt like The Avengers and had sort of that same action/comedy blend with a definitive focus on the action and the fantasy elements. Similar to the first most of the film takes place on Asgard or one of the other realms with some time on Earth but there was simply something more astounding about it this time. Superhero angle aside this was an incredible, stand alone science fiction film. There were actually certain aspects of the film that were reminiscent of Star Wars or had the world's feel to it and I mean that as a compliment. This isn't about a guy in tights saving people but rather a mythical warrior and the world around him. The special effects are jaw dropping and the battle scenes absolutely epic in stature.I think I am fast becoming a Chris Hemsworth fan. Earlier this year he blew me away in Ron Howard's Rush and he is truly larger than life as Thor. There is something undeniably charismatic about him and when he dons that Thor outfit with that ridiculous hammer he absolutely embodies the role. He commands the screen with a character who could be very silly and he has really found his groove since the first film. Natalie Portman returns as Thor's love interest. She is okay in the role. I really do like Portman and I think she's a terrific actress but somehow I can't latch onto her Jane Foster character. They have good chemistry and she gets some decent lines but she doesn't seem to be into it as much as she could be. Tom Hiddleston also returns as Loki in sort of an anti-hero capacity forced to work with his brother. Hemsworth and Hiddleston have a terrific chemistry opposite each other and they have emotionally powerful scenes in this that literally almost brought tears to my eyes...almost. Hiddleston is terrific as Loki and has gone back to more of the dark roots rather than the silly maniacal character from The Avengers. Anthony Hopkins is back again as Odin in a slightly bigger role. Who better to play the All Father than Hollywood legend Hopkins. He is terrific and he instantly adds a new level to the cast. Kat Dennings deserves mention in the supporting cast in a much bigger role than the first film. She is the comic relief and she does what she does best with her biting sarcasm. It is almost overused...almost. But instead it is just the right amount and her one liners had me laughing. Other worthwhile mentions in the supporting cast include Rene Russo, Idris Elba (LOVE his character and I think he could support his own film entirely,) Stellan Skarsgård and Jaimie Alexander all do exceptionally well. Our villain this time is played by Christopher Eccleston and he is definitely a worthy villain. He certainly looks the part and perhaps my only critique would be that they gave him a little more development and a little more personality.I never really understand how they choose directors. In this case you have Alan Taylor who comes almost entirely out of television to land one of the biggest films of the year. Not that there is anything wrong with that because he made a film that is clearly and definitively superior to the its original. Despite a few references to The Avengers, this is a stand alone movie that anyone can come into and enjoy. The scenery and special effects should be tops at the Oscars because it truly was amazing. I did see it in 3D though (as I always say) it was unnecessary. The special effects are good enough that 3D has nothing to do with it. The story is even better, the characters were amazing and I didn't want it to end when it was all over. It very clearly one of the best films I have seen this year and I was so pleased. Also watch for a great (and amusing) Captain America cameo. I keep thinking Marvel is seriously over-saturating the market with their films but if they keep at this quality than bring it on. 9.5/10",Thor - The Dark World
37,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Though initially promising, this instalment soon devolves into tedious and intangible CGI spectacle and tries it's best to focus on anything other than the eponymous hero.",5,29 October 2017,"Initially its prospects seem more promising than its predecessor, but it soon becomes apparent that 'Thor: The Dark World (2013)' is so generic and devoid of character development - not to mention the fact that what little is present is almost immediately upended by the other films in which the eponymous hero appears - that even the impressively rendered CGI spectacle becomes nothing more than a passive viewing experience because we have no connection to any of the characters caught up in its over-the-top proceedings. It doesn't help that Thor himself is barely even in the flick, with large portions of the picture (sometimes even ten minutes) dedicated solely to the downright annoying side characters or the always up-staging yet, at this point, played-out Loki. The film's villain is also so bland, so unthreatening and just so sincerely uninteresting that the thing quickly slips into its own unique rhythm of tedious action and lullaby-like exposition. 5/10.",Thor - The Dark World
38,bowmanblue,By Asgard this is fun!,8,29 June 2014,"If you haven't seen one of the recent crop of 'Marvel comic book movies' then 'Thor: The Dark World' is probably a bit of an odd place to start. So, assuming you've already enjoyed anything from Thor 1 to Iron Man 3, then you'll probably enjoy this, too. It follows the whole 'Marvel superhero formula' pretty closely and, if I'm being harsh, doesn't really bring anything new to the table. However, when a movie is this much fun, a lack of originality isn't that much of a problem.It's a fun, action-packed romp and, even if you haven't seen the first one (or any other Marvel film of late) then, as long as you understand the basic concept of 'good vs evil' then you should have no problem picking up on what's happening.Chris Hemsworth is great as Thor. Tom Hiddleston is equally great as Thor's nemesis 'Loki' and the rest of the cast all play their parts well, too.So, all you need is a big bucket of popcorn and an hour and forty-four minutes to kill and you should enjoy some seriously fun 'hammer time.'

The funny scenes are the best when the superhero first makes himself known or discovers the super powers. Then in the sequels everyone knows about him and it's just not as good.In this sequel little even takes place on Earth, most of it nd attacks is on Asgard. Jane and her interns discover some kind of portal to the dark world and some how she gets the aether absorbed into her, which made little sense. And the aether is a great power than can conquer worlds. Thor goes back to earth to check on Jane and then she ""zaps"" people with energy and then she goes back with him to Asgard. Then this evil elf awakens attacks Asgard, chases ensue and some how they get to the dark world right where the portal to earth is. Then they go back to the earth and the elf follows. Then there is a some what tame battle on earth. Are you following me? See how crazy this is, the plot just didn't work.FINAL VERDICT: There is the Chris Hemsworth without a shirt scene, so that's cool to check out, plus the evil dudes that were rip offs of the predator were neat.

40,g-bodyl,A Worthy Sequel!,9,3 January 2015,"Thor: The Dark World, the sequel to the 2011 film and sort-of-spin off from 2012's The Avengers, is quite a spectacle. Thor isn't my favorite character from the Marvel universe, as I feel Captain America and Iron Man have better character arches, but Thor does have his moments. This film retained the well-liked humor from the first film and added more set pieces to the film to its advantage. The special effects are great and we are still treated to the visual beauty of Asgard. The only part of the film I felt was weak was the forced romance between Thor and Jane. But luckily for the rating, I didn't care too much.Alan Taylor, taking over from Kenneth Branagh in the director's chair, directs a film regarding Thor in the aftermath of New York. In this particular film, Thor must team up with his brother and nemesis Loki to stop the Dark Elves who are led by the malicious Malekith from plunging the world into darkness and once again saving Earth and the Nine Realms.Like many Marvel films, the film has an incredible array of actors and actresses working on the film. Chris Hemsworth as Thor is mighty as ever. Tom Hiddleston provides some of the best humor with his witty dialogue as Loki. Natalie Portman is okay as Jane, but I felt her romance with Thor was forced and unrealistic. Stellan Skarsgaard makes a welcome return and my favorite scene involves him at Stonehenge acting quite weird. Christopher Eccleston actually makes for a solid villain. Finally, we get some brief, but effective supporting turns from Anthony Hopkins, Idris Elba, and Rene Russo.Overall, the Thor sequel pushes up the stakes even more as Thor and Loki must try to the save the universe yet again. I loved the humor, willingly provided by Loki. I also loved how the film is action-packed without sacrificing anything for the story. Towards the end, we have a great action scene involving the travel between many worlds, so that was quite fascinating to watch. The visual effects are also impressive as well. This is an incredible sequel, about on par with the first film. There are also several scenes to keep an eye out for in the post-credits. I rate this film 9/10.",Thor - The Dark World
41,cricketbat,Don't think about it too much,6,21 September 2018,"Thor: The Dark World is visually entertaining. It presents a bunch of new worlds (with unpronounceable names) along with interesting technology and advanced weaponry. However, the story is a bit choppy and the jokes seem like they were shoehorned in after the script was written. Additionally, it reduces Loki from being a cunning antagonist to being the comic relief. As long as you don't think about it too much, I think you'll enjoy this movie.",Thor - The Dark World
42,lesleyharris30,"A Fresh Sequel that Won't Disappoint Thor Fans,",9,4 December 2013,"Thor: The Dark World is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and an impressive cast. I think that fans of the first Thor will definitely not be disappointed, it's a very enjoyable and action packed movie that answers all the questions from the first that were left unanswered, as well as building on and adding more scope to the world of Asgard. In comparison to some of Marvels previous work, it does take itself a little too seriously. There is comic relief there, but not as much as Iron Man or Captain America, there were times were it was borderline pretentious in just how dramatic it was dealing with the whole situation, when it's suppose to be simple fun. Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston and the rest of the cast are back and as good as before. The chemistry Hemsworth shares with his two co-stars on screen is one of the strongest aspects of this film. I also really enjoyed Chris O'Dowd's cameo, one of the funniest parts.It manages to bring in a lot more complicated elements that the Marvel Universe has not previously showcased, making it both understandable and believable. Thor: The Dark World is a must see for all Marvel and Thor fans.When an alien enemy is looking to destroy Earth, Thor is the only one who can put a stop to him, while also rekindling his relationship with Jane.

43,A_Different_Drummer,"Yep, they got the ""dark"" part right..",2,6 December 2013,"Well they got the ""dark"" part right. Does it distress anyone at all that somewhere deep in the bowels of Hollywood there are people who make many times what you make for coming up with the idea that watching a lot of banging and clanging in an alternate universe that -- at its best -- resembles Central Park at midnight is .... entertainment? If it does not, it should. The problem with sequels like this -- aside from the fact that they are actually produced in the first place -- is that they serve no useful purpose other than making the original in the franchise look better than it was. I promise you, IN THE NAME OF ODIN AND ALL THE 9 WORLDS, that half way through this exercise in controlled depression, you will long for Thor 1. (With its really clever opening -- essentially the story of a Boy and his Hammer, having been separated therefrom, and finally reunited). Tom Hiddleston steals all his scenes, in some places he is more interesting huddled in a corner reading a book than all the CGI flashbangs and associated pyrotechnics combined. Sir Anthony -- a man seemingly untroubled by how poorly this phase of his career pales in comparison to his prior work -- is lost behind his eyepatch and almost unrecognizable. Portman has never had better H&M (hair and makeup) and in the chatgroups there are fanboys prattling on about watching this with the sound off. A final factoid: In the 60s, in the days when Marvel was only comics, Thor was never top gun, it was the artwork (flaming yellow hair) and the pleasant predictability of the stories and the arcane language that carried the brand. So far, Marvel has yet to really translate this into film.",Thor - The Dark World

Having no other choice they all must unite with the enemy they most despise in order to save everything and everyone. As many of you know by now I am not a huge comic book movie fan. I will say that of the entire Avengers saga the first Thor was my favorite movie. Due to that I had pretty high expectations for this one. I won't say I was disappointed because I did like it but I didn't think it was as good as the first one. They can only do the superhero saving Earth story so many times so with this one they added the threat to Thor's home world as well. Most of the movie takes place on Asgard so that aspect was nice and it did have a fair amount of comedy to keep it entertaining all the way through. There was just something missing in this one that the first one had. I don't know if it was because my expectations for this one were much higher then the original but I didn't have the same enjoyment from this one the other had. All that said though this is a good movie and worth watching, especially to continue the complete story of the saga. Overall, good movie but I didn't think it was as good as first one.

48,ironhorse_iv,Can Lightning strike twice? Yes. Thor: The Dark World was as good as the original film.,7,11 November 2013,"Thor: the Dark World was action pack to the point that indeed it was the God of Thunder. My ears hurts after this movie. Louds of exploding sounds. Unlike the first movie, where Thor lost his power, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) in this film is more God-like, and mature. Thor isn't learning anything new as a human being, or being taught a lesson in this movie. It just Thor trying to stop an alien invasion, yet again like 2012's Avengers. Indeed, comic book fans would like to see Thor do more Thor things and they got it. In my opinion, I like character development, and this movie lacks that. The movie plot is bit too confusing and silly for me. The aliens trying to conquer the Universe with a weapon known as Aether seem one-dimension villains who just happen to be just evil. After all they are call Dark Elves. Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) played a competent bad guy and I was really disappointed by his performance. I really wanted him to stand out more. Even with me, reading some of the Thor comic books, knowing a few Norse mythology, and watching the previous films, I did find myself, coming in lost. I can only guess, what first time people were thinking coming into the film, they must be asking themselves, what in the hell are we watching? The movie does an OK job, telling the backstory of the plot, and then to repeat it time after time just to make sure, but even with that, as a first time Thor watcher, you might find yourself confused. Unlike the original film that takes place mostly on Earth, in this film, most of scenes take place in the CGI world-building nine realms worlds of Norse mythology. The worlds is a lot better, than the first movie as I thought Asgard look so fake in the CGI due to all the shine crap. Asgard is supposed to look old, grittier and dirty like Vikings. It been there for thousands of years. Glad to see the film, wasn't in Dutch angle that much this time. In this film, it remind me of bit of Lord of the Rings, as more details are added to the mixed. After all, there was even a language created for the Dark Elves. Still, the Shakespeare dialogue got to the point, I was not only getting lost, but tune out. Hard to relate to the main characters, when nothing about them, is even relates to the real world. I found myself, trying to escape this world, but the dialogue is so bland. Yes, the film did had lot of humor. Mostly the same fish-out-of-water jokes from the first film. It was a hit or miss. They even made Thor look more like a meatball than the previous films. They did give Loki (Tom Hiddleston) most of the best lines in the film. I have to say that when Thor has to team up with Loki against his newest threat, it was some of the best scenes in the film. They had this buddy cop thing going for them. I think Marvel really did hit the gold mine with the actor because he does bring some really need charm, and humor to a really out of place world. I think the ladies in the room even like his presence. Most of the humor, came in the form of a side-character that fans of the first movie kinda didn't like which is Darcy Lewis (Kat Denning). In this movie, she is given more annoying scenes, but at less she kinda has a reason to be in the film. I'm sorry, but I'm not a huge fan of the character as her scenes feel like filler scenes that has nothing to do with the main plot. The female leads seems really weak in this film. In my opinion, I thought Thor and Loki had more screen connection, than Foster and Thor. Natalie Portman as the love-interest to Thor, Jane Foster, seem really to be phoning in her performance, here. I really doubt, Portman really gave much of herself in acting for this role. She really seem like she didn't want to act in this picture. It was no surprised that on screen, her performance was mediocre. She nearly backed out, when Director Patty Jenkins was replace by director Alan Taylor. She refused to return for the sequel but she was forced to return due to her contract. I did like the surprise secrets cameos: look out for somebody a certain American to make his brief presence, creator Stan Lee and if you stay after the credits, a certain character from the 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy movie. There was some things, I didn't like. I didn't like the awful plot recycle similar to the Avengers film with Aether sounding like the same thing as the Tesseract AKA Cosmic Cube. Without spoiling too much, look out for a lot of recycle fake out deaths like the first movie, 'Thor'. So annoying as hell. I did like the action in the film. I like the portal action scene in the end. It was pretty interesting and funny seeing Thor's beloved supercharged hammer ""Molinjor"" trying to find him. Watch it in 2D, the 3D added little of worth. Overall: The movie is a little far fetch even for a comic book movie as Thor has always been a hard character to get people into liking him, but it works here to a point. At least, if they cut like 30 minutes of the film. This deeply cheesy cartoonish, extremely noisy action movie that's drowning in CGI was not the worst comic book film, in my opinion. It was a feel good fun fantasy escape movie. It work as a good filler film before the next Avengers film.",Thor - The Dark World

I guess in another way that I did not find that mixing the gods of the Norse pantheon with the world of superheroes really worked all that well. To me it just seemed to be wrong. Okay, I understand that Thor is the member of the Avengers, and the comic series that bears his name is quite popular, but to me parts of this film did not seem to work. In fact I found it quite boring.Okay, I did manage to spot Stan Lee, and I did like a couple of the twists at the end, but I am also glad that I missed the end-end sequence (as opposed to the end sequence) but then I have never been one who really wants to sit through a bunch of credits just to see the end scene. Some people suggest that we should sit through all the credits to acknowledge the contribution that the people made to the movie, however that may be, and they are entitled to that view, but my understanding is that if your name is in the credits it means a lot more than just me seeing it. I my name was in the credits to a movie I would rather potential employers see it because that is evidence that I have experience working on a film set.Also, the other thing that gripped me with this film was the numerous references to 'The Avengers'. Now, I have seen The Avengers, but it was over a year ago and I simply cannot remember much of what happened in that film. The references in Ironman 3 were okay because that assumed that you had seen the film but may not have remembered many of the details (I remember a giant centipede flying around New York City and Robert Downey Jnr) whereas this film seemed to assume a working knowledge and deep familiarity with The Avengers, something which simply did not work for me.",Thor - The Dark World

Just a few months back, I praised Hemsworth for his best ever performance in the biographical picture 'Rush'. Here he has fallen back to okay kinda performance. The movie was nothing special, but a decent entertainment. Technically, it was rich in visuals with good graphics, no one must dare to doubt it. My problem was the story which followed the usual fantasy movie protocol. One of the disappointment from 2013, completely a commercial purpose behind its creation and production.

54,John6Daniels,I still like it.,7,15 October 2020,"Thor the Dark World was a major improvement from Thor 1 and Thor/Asgardian costume design improvements from avengers 1.TDW had a more elegant royal and viking feel. The sets felt were more organic. Asgard still seemed squished.The only characters to have any development were Thor Loki and Jane. Everyone else were just there. Simply just there.The effects were better. The fight scenes were also better. Although the fight scene of Thor getting beat up by kurse was lame. That one could have been better x60.Jane is just Jane. She teleports to the aether and that's how the story begins. Her stooges minus Erik. Were bozos. I like Darcy but she's a kind of a waste.Melekith the accursed. Many people don't understand his motives. I do. His people need darkness to function and live like man needs the sun. In order for his people to survive they plan on making the 9 realms dark (plus for revenge and because they are just bad elves. )
The movie doesn't emphasize this at all. That's where I think people go wrong with not understanding Meleikth the accursed. It's typical of mcu movies to not explain things and leave things up for countless fan theories. Or some times deliberate plot holes.Odin is there but wasted.Thors mom who we rarely saw gets axed. Her funeral scene was iconic.Warriors 3 and Hiemdall. Wasted talent and potential.Overall Thor 2 is a fun galactic mystical viking movie. If it were not for rushing for a connected universe. Thor 1 and 2 would be simular to Lord of the rings.
Thor mcu movies is basically one of a kind that isn't over the top spectacular. Still you can enjoy it.Verdict: can I get my shoe back?",Thor - The Dark World
55,paulclaassen,Huge disappointment.,3,3 July 2018,"Unfortunately, a disappointment. The magic moments of the first film made place for a CGI-loaded surreal world without depth and emotion.

57,tomgillespie2002,Best enjoyed on auto-pilot,6,9 December 2013,"One of the surprising successes to come out of Marvel's (now Disney's) ever-increasing catalogue of superhero CGI-fests, was 2011's Thor. Somehow Kenneth Branagh managed to avoid any possible silliness in the story of the super-powered, bleach-blonde Asgardian God battling against his greasy-haired brother and save Earth from destruction. Thor tended to stay away from the gold-plated, computer-generated tedium of Asgard and told a slightly comedic fish-out-of-water tale that was both charming and, even surprisingly, emotionally complex. The sequel, directed by HBO veteran Alan Taylor, spends less time on Earth and more time zapping around the other worlds that make up the universe's Nine Realms.In a backstory-heavy introduction, we learn that a powerful 'Dark Elf' Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) was the leader of a powerful race that tried to use an energy source called the Aether to plunge the Nine Realms into darkness, but was overthrown by Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) grandfather, Bor. With Malekith defeated, Bor hides the Aether in a stone column, establishing a new era of peace across the Realms. On present-day Earth, Thor's old flame Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) accidentally discovers the Aether, which is absorbed into her body. Malekith, who has being lying dormant for years, is re-awoken by this event and seeks the Aether for himself, but not before Thor manages to whisk Jane back to Asgard.It's a typically McGuffin-riddled story that Marvel have managed to turn into a multi-billion dollar franchise, that simply allows the superhero to get from point A to point B in order to face the new big baddie in town. The Dark World is a loud, convoluted and epilepsy-inducing mess of huge battles and CGI landscapes, but, even if you can't get your head around the ridiculous, head-spinning plot, it's sure entertaining. But what The Dark World lacks is the tongue-in-cheek charm of the first film, insisting on making the story and tone 'darker', and moves the action to the sickly world of Asgard.What it does boast, is the return of the superb chemistry between Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, the latter as the imprisoned Loki, forced to reflect after the near-apocalypse of The Avengers (2012). It has been reported that Loki's involvement was beefed up significantly post- production, and his sneering, malevolent, yet wounded presence is welcome, especially when Thor is forced to team up with his brother to tackle Malekith. This, however, came at the expense of Eccleston's pointy-eared menace, whose back-story and screen-time were reduced so harshly that you almost forget he's there. Portman's Jane Foster is still, unfortunately, a bland bore, mad at Thor for not calling in two years. He was saving the world, love.Ultimately, Thor: The Dark World is sporadically fun, punctured by moments of CGI tedium and head-spinning exposition (usually delivered by Anthony Hopkins' bored-looking Odin), that often evoke the unnecessary complexity of the rather painful Pirate of the Caribbean sequels. When the portals start appearing and the wrestling Thor and Malekith begin to throw each other between different worlds within the Nine Realms, I held my hands up and just gave up. And maybe this is the approach to take - just simply let it play out in front of your eyes, enjoy the charisma of Hemsworth - who delivers another delightful performance - and pray that someday Marvel will give Loki his own movie.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Thor - The Dark World
58,cruise01,Better than the first but a weak villain.,9,5 May 2020,4.5 out of 5 stars.Thor the Dark World is an improvement over the first movie. Delivering exciting action sequences. Fun characters. Plot about the dark elves and the Ether which comes into an important role with MCU. The cast ensemble is good. The visual effects are great. The film does have an emotional moment. The villain i thought was underdeveloped and forgettable. The ending does leave off in a cliffhanger for another.There is an important mid credit scene and a post credit scene that is played for laughs which i thought it was a waste.,Thor - The Dark World
59,poe426,Thor- a bore...?,7,8 November 2013,"Given the possibilities, it's more than a little disappointing that the makers of THOR: THE DARK WORLD would opt to do a story about ""dark elves."" For one thing, there WERE no dark elves in the original comics- not ONE, that I can recall. (Granted, ""this ain't your daddy's Thor,"" but it IS, just revamped for today's less discriminating moviegoers.) Why not do a story about Ulik, mightiest of the Rock Trolls...? ('Cause this ain't your daddy's Thor...?) To see the mighty troll marshal his army to invade Asgard itself would've been great. Consider: We see an Asgradian outpost on the edge of the Troll Lands. Battle-armored trolls attack the outpost (using the widest array of weapons imaginable, forged in their underground furnaces). Cut to another outpost, as trolls emerge from underground to attack and capture it. Thor (wearing his trademarked helmet, which he DOESN'T in THOR: THE DARK WORLD) gathers his men for a counter-attack. The armies battle to a standstill- at which point Ulik steps forth to challenge Thor to a one-on-one slugfest (no cgi, just breakaway boulders and such). Here, we discover that Loki has had a hand in the troll invasion, giving them strategic information every step of the way. Thor, to overcome superior numbers, calls forth a thunderstorm that wipes the troll army back from whence it came. Compare THAT scenario to what we see in THE DARK WORLD. I don't think I've seen a movie with so many clichéd lines in quite a while. While the makeup effects and the cgi are better than in the first film, the story is every bit as ponderous: scenes drag on interminably at times, with pompous characters hammering the point(s) mercilessly- and the attempts at humor, while they might garner the occasional chuckle, are sophomoric at best and are used more often than not to undermine the ""seriousness"" of the situation(s). And am I the only one more than a little tired of the post-credit ""tag"" scenes? (We were subjected to a half hour of television commercials prior to half an hour of previews BEFORE the movie started- then we had to sit through ten minutes of production crew credits before the last scene. Come on, people- give us a break.)",Thor - The Dark World
60,eddie_baggins,Fun yet predictable action/superhero movie,6,13 March 2014,"When the original Thor was released in 2011 It came out in a midst of wondering as to whether it would connect with audiences. Was the public ready to take to an actual hammer wielding God played by a then virtually unknown Australian actor in a setting that seemed ripe for parody? In 2014 the answer is an overwhelming yes with Thor and in a real world sense Chris Hemsworth becoming one of the most popular Marvel screen incarnations but with this popularity comes more expectation. The original Thor was a pleasantly entertaining surprise directed with a stately manner by Brit Kenneth Branagh so how does the sequel match up? The worst thing about Thor: The Dark World is just how achingly predictable the whole plot line is and if it were not for that there is much to enjoy in this sequel that doesn't take itself too seriously and features a rampant pace that is missing in many middling Blockbusters of recent times. Most scenes in the movie feel well paced and edited with barely a moment in between set pieces to catch your breathe. It's perhaps thanks to Game of Thrones mainstay and now Dark World director Alan Taylor that the film plays out in such a manner and produces some at times highly impressive visuals and vistas. With all this highly polished production and behind the scenes wins going back to the story is what makes the movie sadly such a forgettable one.Thor's original casting was a major win in the beginning and again the leads in Hemsworth, Portman, Hiddleston and Hopkins all do a fine job with their respective roles with predictably banter between both Thor and Loki a particular highlight. Eccleston as the lead villain Malekith is sadly a complete non-event with what is perhaps the most lame and uninteresting Marvel screen villain we have yet seen (that is saying something when you look back to The Sandman). In concerns to the story it seems like an afterthought with the melodrama that plays out within it and there is never any real sense of the stakes as the film just doesn't try enough to have that dread that worked so well with the Avengers or even the original Thor.To criticise a story in a Marvel movie may seem trivial but to go with your bang for your buck you want your brain engaged also with a story that feels somewhat fresh and original and sadly despite spectacle and an easy going charm The Dark World misses this mark badly. In saying this characters within the film remain interesting in their own right and with such a brisk pace the film truly never outstays its welcome.3 convenient cave time travel portals out of 5 P.S – as per usual with a Marvel jaunt make sure your stay through all the credits!

61,pennyelenabooks,good enough,6,26 July 2015,"Thor has to stop the evil dark elves from getting the energy that Jane has accidentally hosted in her body in order to prevent them from turning the world into darkness. The second Thor movie isn't like the first one, but it is entertaining. Two things that bothered me: -you have to have watched the avengers before you watch the movie. Fortunatelly I did, but for someone who hasn't, it will be annoying as they are brought up frequently and some of parts of the story are connected to the avengers movie, like Loki's imprisonment. -the first part of the movie is a little shaky, as the plot tries to get to the point. So we have Jane in London, waiting for Thor to come and Thor trying to find a way to go back to her. In other ways the movie is quite entertaining and enjoyable. I even started to like Loki, but the end kind of spoiled that. That said the plot was a little complicated but I guess it wasn't that bad. So I give Thor a 6 out of 10.",Thor - The Dark World
62,leonblackwood,Great movie! 8/10,8,2 March 2014,"Review: This is a very well made movie that covers every aspect of a super-hero movie. The storyline was well put together by the director and the whole look and feel of the film is great. All of the actors put in great performances, especially Chris Hemsworth who plays Thor extremely well. The storyline follows on from the previous Thor and The Avengers, which was a great choice by the director, and I'm glad that they showed a different side to Loki. The only downside to the movie is that the director tried to compact so much information into one film, so you really do have to concentrate with what is going on, but that's not to say that it confusing or misguiding. If your a fan of the comics, you won't be disappointed, and if you don't know that much about Thor, you still be entertained and interested in the story that unfolds. Great Movie!Round-Up: I was a bit dubious about the director bringing back Natalie Portman, but once she goes back to Asgard, she reminded me of when she was in Star Wars, playing Princess Leah's mum. Anyway, I really can't see anyone else playing Thor but Chris Hemsworth who adds a certain type of cockiness and wit to the comic book hero. All of the directors are doing well with the Avengers franchise, but I must admit, I am waiting for a Hulk movie after seeing Mark Ruffalo playing the part well. In all, this is a movie that has something for everyone. With amazing action, storyline and humour, this is a movie not to be missed.Budget: $170million Worldwide Gross: $641millionI recommend this movie to people who are into comic book hero movies and who are fans of the Thor franchise. 8/10",Thor - The Dark World
63,TheMovieDiorama,Thor The Dark World soars endlessly in Asgardian light instead of Elvish darkness.,5,24 April 2019,"Continuing on from the events of 'The Avengers' and acting as a sequel to 'Thor', which is incredibly underrated and overlooked, The Dark World shrouds itself in ancient magic and elusive mysticism. Expertly crafted world building, only to present a contrived, arduous and over-extensive story that struggled to find any footing. Thor's electrifying mighty hammer ""meow meow"" was not enough to appease a sub-standard plot conforming to the typical ""save the world"" formula and absent of any character development. Fans of the MCU typically forget about this sequel, and it's not difficult to see why. Jane, in an endless search to find Thor again, coincidentally enters a realm which contains the Aether, a primordial entity withholding dark matter. She inadvertently consumes it, the Dark Elves want it back and Thor must save the Nine Realms again.Visually, the world of Asgard looked stunning. Clean beautiful shots of towering architecture, fully embracing its fantastical green screens which were hardly noticeable. In fact, the majority of the visual effects were excellently produced (aside from Marvel's eternal weakness, human CGI), particularly the designs of the Dark Elves spaceships as they recklessly invade Asgard. The returning cast all gave consistently good performances. Hemsworth, Portman and Hiddleston retain the original likability that we've all come to adore. Although Russo, Hopkins and Ecclestone were questionably underused. Costumes were fitting, production design detailed and a plethora of other technical aspects being fully functional. That's not The Dark World's problem.The inherent issue is with the unmemorable story that lacks any evolution for the characters involved. Thor remains the same from the start to the end. Loki is still mischievous without emanating any emotional conflict of vengeance. And Jane, unfortunately, subsides into a convenient plot device just so Thor has a reason to come back to Earth. The relationship between the two never progresses, and feels more forced than ever. And over half of the film is set on Asgard with the narrative progression becoming stagnant. Nothing happens.Then we come to the antagonist, Malekith. The accursed. Ruler of the Dark Elves, and one of the most powerful. Shame that he was completely wasted in this formulaic story. Seriously, the most underdeveloped pointless waste of a Marvel villain in the entire MCU. Ecclestone, a talented character actor, was pushed aside for Dennings' insufferably unfunny remarks, in an attempt to inject some humour that the original was apparently absent of. It just further cements the unmemorable qualities that The Dark World upholds.Whilst not necessarily a bad film, I mean it is watchable to an extent, it fails to live up to the quality of previous entries (minus 'Iron Man 2' and 'The Incredible Hulk'...). Leaving the film rotting in the dusty realm of Svartalfheim.",Thor - The Dark World

65,matthewssilverhammer,The corniness of dialogue and convoluted elements don't keep The Dark World from being an entertaining and appropriately funny addition to the Avengers universe.,6,24 November 2013,"""Thor: The Dark World"" has problems. Actually, it has a few problems. The battle scenes are generic. The editing is sloppy. There are moments of cheese, and the dialogue needs some spicing up. Most dubious is the confusing main conflict with the forgettable villain, Malekith. However, despite the corniness and the convoluted elements plaguing it, ""The Dark World"" is a highly entertaining, engaging, and surprisingly funny addition to The Avengers universe. In order to buy into these Thor films, one must be okay with Thor being a stupid, albeit fun, Marvel character. Sure, his entire lore is hokey, but it is intentionally so, and the filmmakers behind this installment are well aware of this, using it to their benefit in great humorous effect. And while Portman seems bored playing love interest Jane, most other performances are strong and lively. Hemsworth, Dennings, and Skarsgard are better fleshed out and play their roles with ease. However, the real winner here is Hiddleston, gleefully villainous as Loki, one of the most complex and sympathetic baddies in years. Outside of ""Star Trek"", this is the best big franchise film of the year. Even though Marvel slightly missed the mark with ""Iron Man 3"", they have returned to solid filmmaking form here through great cartoony graphics, unique superhero cinematography and a solid action movie score. So while it won't win over many new fans for Thor, it will satisfy old ones biding their time until the next Avengers movie.",Thor - The Dark World
66,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Marvel takes a full-on sci-fi/fantasy approach with 'Dark World',7,11 November 2013,"Most moviegoers probably didn't realize Thor was a comic book character in the Marvel universe before his big-screen debut in 2011. Flash forward just two and a half years later and Chris Hemsworth has portrayed the Norse god of thunder three times already. ""Thor: The Dark World"" looks to continue riding the post-""Avengers"" wave, but Avengers cameos and S.H.I.E.L.D references aside, it's not what most audiences have come to know as a superhero movie.This won't matter for the target audience of ""Thor: The Dark World."" I count myself among the many who get giddy over mentions of realms, Dark Elves and powerful Aether. These, however, are the hallmarks of sci fi/fantasy. So, let the record state that ""The Dark World"" falls most definitively in that category, because if that doesn't excite you, ""The Dark World"" most likely won't.Marvel Studios hasn't misfired since ""Iron Man 2,"" which — all superhero films ever considered — wasn't that much of a misfire. Thor's second solo outing more or less measures similarly to Iron Man's. The movie just doesn't have much going for it besides its geek-tastic charms, a charismatic leading man and one of the most complex and lovable villains in Loki (Tom Hiddleston).Anything that opens with a scene explaining a battle that happened long ago in which a villain and an evil power were thought to be sealed away forever better be ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" otherwise it belongs in a video game. Unfortunately, that's the sour note ""The Dark World"" begins on, explaining how Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and the Dark Elves of Svartalfheim tried to use a powerful dark matter called Aether to cast the nine realms in darkness exactly 5,000 years ago, the last time all nine realms aligned. Of course, such things happen every 5,000 years, and when Thor's love, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), happens upon the Aether, Malekith awakens to take his vengeance.""Thor: The Dark World"" shares a lot of characteristics with ""Star Trek,"" jumping between realms as ""Star Trek"" does planets, introducing new species with cool spaceships and cooler weapons. Asgard comes to life with the same aesthetic that original ""Thor"" director Kenneth Branagh and the Marvel Studios creative team dreamed up a few years ago, but ""Dark World"" director Alan Taylor (""Game of Thrones"") gets to play around in it. The film is almost unapologetic in the way it splashes around in sci-fi/fantasy hallmarks, and Taylor's fight sequences are a significant improvement from the first ""Thor"" in terms of style.Taylor was also a decent pick in terms of familial tensions in fantasy. The Thor-Loki dynamic was a highlight in the first film, and given that Loki caused all the mischief in ""The Avengers,"" it's twice as interesting watching Hiddleston and Hemsworth together. Hiddleston in particular continues to step even deeper into the role in this film, though Loki is mostly relegated to a subplot except for the film's most exciting sequence, when Thor and the Warriors Three enlist his help to try and trick Malekith. The script takes full advantage of his trickster powers, but also creates an intriguing character arc for him. It's hard to say if it's the writing and Hiddleston that make Loki a huge highlight of ""The Dark World,"" or the notion of his subplot also serving as a continuation of what happened in ""The Avengers"" and a precursor to what will come in ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron."" Either way, ""The Dark World"" has significantly more of a post-""Avengers"" component than ""Iron Man 3"" did. The script also shares the same sense of humor that gave the first ""Thor"" its charm. Hemsworth is such a presence that when he gets to deliver a subtle a joke it has an ironic twist to it that works every time. The humor revolving around the human characters, however, such as Kat Dennings (who needs to not appear in these films ever again — she isn't going to be the deciding factor for teenage girls thinking of buying tickets), tends to be corny. Predictably, Portman is a wasted talent yet again as Foster is further reduced to a damsel in distress fawning over Thor despite his tendency to run off to other realms and leave her for extended periods of time.Given Marvel Studios' pedigree, it's fair to call ""Thor: The Dark World"" underwhelming. Plenty to look at, laugh at and geek out over, but a film that will ultimately be seen as a gap-filler between two epic ""Avengers"" films. That's okay for Thor, because you don't necessarily have to give grounding to a fantastical character from such a strange universe, but some effort to make the film a bit suspenseful and prove a trial for the main characters might've helped stave off our wild anticipation for May 2015.~Steven CThanks for reading!

68,Vartiainen,The worst Marvel movie so far,5,5 July 2015,"Thor: The Dark World is the worst film Marvel has done in their Cinematic Universe. So far. And it still means that, by any objective standard, it's a good film with plenty of great action, phenomenal visual effects and good actors.It's just that the story is boring. We get to see Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) once again as she continues to unravel the mysteries of the universe with her band of plucky sidekicks. Meanwhile, an old threat awakens to cast a shadow over the peace of Asgard, the Realm Eternal. And thus Jane and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) meet once again to protect the Nine Realms. Sounds exciting? It could have been. Unfortunately, whereas in the first Thor movie we had an extremely interesting and dynamic villain in Loki (Tom Hiddleston), here the villain is about as interesting as watching a cattle drive. It sounds and seems exciting at first, but the monotony settles in very quickly. Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) has no edge, and quite honestly no personality either. He wants to take over the world because... he wants to take over the world. All the Marvel villains before this film had been huge. They were individuals, larger than life, always scheming, plotting, usually with a smirk on their face. This... man... elf... emo band reject, on the other hand, is only distinguished from his troops by the fact that he speaks a bit more and has a snazzier uniform.The rest of the movie is fine. It's not as good as the first Thor, or any of the other Marvel films, but the returning actors are on the top of their game, it's certainly nice to see Jane, Darcy and Erik once again, not to mention Loki - who still absolutely steals every scene he's in - and the visuals works splendidly. It's only that the story cannot be as captivating as it needs to be without an effective villain.Thor: The Dark World is not the first bad Marvel film, the coming of which we fearfully still await and hope to avoid completely, but it is the first Marvel film that can only be described as average on the whole. Which makes it disappointing, but ultimately still worth a watch.",Thor - The Dark World

But Malekith is stopped by Bor (Tony Curran) and the armies of Asgard.After the events of The Avengers, Loki has been taken to the prisons of Asgard, only to avoid a death sentence by the grace of his mother, Frigga (Rene Russo) as Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and his friends try to bring peace to the Nine Realms. Soon, Thor is drawn back to Earth when Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) makes a discovery of a strange an anomaly in London. Thor takes Jane to Asgard where the realm the Dark Elves attack with the fabric of reality at stake.The filmmakers of Thor: The Dark World go for the approach that bigger is better. There is more action, larger stakes, lots of fantasy and plenty of battles. TV director Alan Taylor, best known for his work on Game of Thrones shows great confidence with transition to film. The action is bigger and a improvement upon the first film, getting massive battles and fights and more regular. Audiences can easily geek out as it blends medieval weaponry, magic and laser battles.Thor: The Dark World goes the whole hog with its blend of sci-fi and fantasy, from a Lord of the Rings style opening, the gravity anomaly in London looking like something from a Doctor Who episode and the use of spaceships. It is a film that is completely unashamed about its comic book origins and 10-year-old boys and the 10-year-old inside all of us will love it.The events on Earth and Asgard are juxtaposed by two different styles. The action in Asgard is treated seriously with the full embraced of the fantasy, whilst the Earth scenes are much more light hearted. Kat Dennings continues to be the comic relief and this time she has comedy with her own intern played by Jonathan Howard and Stellan Skarsgård's Dr Selvig is relegated to running around Stonehenge naked and being locked into mental hospital.Taylor does put his stamp all over Thor: The Dark World, making a visually darker film by using dark cinematography and the art direction for Asgard is clearly influenced by Game of Thrones. Asgard has more of grounded medieval look in Thor: The Dark World then the grand look of Kenneth Branagh's film.Thor: The Dark World is a strong continuation of the Thor series and this is illustrated with the relationship between Thor and Loki. The characters have learned from each other and their experience and the relationship has evolved into one of banter between the brothers. Loki continues to be the most interesting villain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and shows growth with his tragedy and pain.Former Doctor Who star Christopher Eccleston took on the villain and he does the job well, giving a professional performance as Malekith, He may not have the depth of Loki and his motivations are stock, but he does a great job. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje and his large stature as Kurse gave Thor a big physical challenge that he needed and leads to a massive fight.Thor: The Dark World is far from deep or meaningful, but it's a fun ride and an entertaining fantasy adventure that raises improves on the action level and strong follow-up to the series.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",Thor - The Dark World
73,dee.reid,"The little girl who loved Thor in ""Adventures in Babysitting"" (1987)...",9,12 November 2013,"My biggest complaint with that great British thespian/director Kenneth Branagh's take on ""Thor"" (2011) was that its titular character, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the God of Thunder in Norse mythology reinterpreted as a Marvel Comics superhero, seemed to adjust to life on Earth fairly quickly after being exiled here by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) as a lesson in humility.That problem can be forgiven here (since in the grander scheme of things, my overall opinion is hardly consequential to anything), since two years have passed and Thor has spent that time on his home-world of Asgard, rather than on Earth, even though he still longs for his mortal would-be girlfriend Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), and she for him.And that's one of the things to take away from ""Thor: The Dark World"" - the resolutions of various relationships - with Alan Taylor replacing Kenneth Branagh (who brought some Shakespearean-styled drama to a superhero movie with the first ""Thor"") and he takes the series into much darker territory, even though there's still a variety of well-placed humor here to liven things up a little bit; imagine even a smidgen of humor in Christopher Nolan's ultra-serious ""Dark Knight"" movies - oh, the horror!To be fair, I enjoyed this picture more than I did the first one, if because the changes in the director's chair also resulted in a change of direction into a darker one. So again, Earth is in danger from an other-worldly threat that is beyond human comprehension. The Mighty Thor is forced to not only save our planet, but his own as well, from the genocidal warlord Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), a Dark Elf who sacrificed his entire army to try to defeat Asgard in a thrilling a prologue, only to go into hibernation for 5,000 years so that he could once again try to wipe out Asgard, something that requires the life of the human Jane Foster for him to do.So Thor is forced to do the unthinkable: he must team up with his traitorous adopted brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston, a ""Thor"" film's best performer, once again), who is now currently imprisoned for his crimes against humanity in ""Thor"" and ""The Avengers"" (2012), if they are to save both Earth and Asgard.The focus in ""Thor: The Dark World,"" aside from the various superhero battles, are the relationships - chiefly Thor's romance with the human Jane Foster, and his complicated familial relationships with his parents and of course, Loki, who still vies for the throne of Asgard. And it's also about how Thor must juggle all these if he is to save two worlds from a threat that not even he can defeat all on his own (hence the teaming up with Loki).I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I did ""Thor."" Here is one of those rare sequels that performed better than its predecessor.9/10",Thor - The Dark World
74,stevendbeard,Covers Basics of a Great Sequel,8,8 November 2013,"I saw ""Thor: The Dark World"", starring Chris Hemsworth-Red Dawn-2012, Star Trek-2009; Natalie Portman-Black Swan, Zoolander; Tom Hiddleston- The Avengers-2012, The Deep Blue Sea; Christopher Eccleston-G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, Doctor Who-t.v.-2005 and Anthony Hopkins-Red 2, The Mask of Zorro.This is the second Thor movie, or actually the third, if you count the Avengers, and it covers all the basics of a good sequel. Chris returns as Thor, fighting the battle against evil dark elves, who are led by Christopher, as Malekith. It seems that there is an evil energy force called the Aether, which is so powerful that it could mean the end of everything, and guess who wants it? Yep, Christopher. FYI: For all the comic book nerds like me, the Aether is known by another name that you should know, it's one of the six Infinity Gems. Anthony returns as Odin, the father of Chris and the king of the nine realms, including Asgard, their home planet. Tom returns as Chris's evil brother Loki, who is sentenced by Anthony to be put into the deepest dungeon that can be found on Asgard, mainly for his part in the Avengers escapade in New York. Natalie has found her way to London, in her search for Chris; she wants to find a connection between Earth and Asgard so that they can be reunited. The only problem is that she gets into a situation where she ends up possessing the elusive Aether that Christopher wants and the hunt is on. Chris even has to bust his brother Tom out of jail to help in the good fight. But, can Tom be trusted? One of his nicknames is 'The Trickster' or god of lies. There are some good fight sequences, I especially liked it when Chris would spin his hammer before applying it to the job at hand, just like in the comics. I also liked the balance of humor with the action. As far as cameos go, Stan Lee appears in the mental hospital scene-he wants his shoe back-and there is a small scene with the appearance of another super hero in costume. When the end credits start, there is a scene, and then at the very end is another scene, so don't leave early, or you will miss the set up for the next movie. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and mild language and has a running time of 1 hour & 52 minutes. I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Thor - The Dark World
75,JoeB131,Pretty Good sequel,7,10 August 2014,"This film takes place after the Avengers movie, where Dark Elves are returning to our universe to destroy it. Thor and Loki must work together to stop them.Chris Hemsworth is pretty good again as Thor. Tom Hiddelston once again steals the scenes he is in as Loki. Most of the cast from the original movie has returned, and put in solid performances.The most disappointing aspect is that Christopher Eccelston plays a villain that is completely forgettable. Seriously, I barely recognized the guy and frankly, they could have done him as CGI and no one would have noticed the difference. (Of course, his turn as Doctor Who was equally forgettable.) And, yes, you had a twist ending everyone should have seen coming. No doubt, setting up Thor III.",Thor - The Dark World
76,drqshadow-reviews,"A Strong, Fantasy-Powered Alternative to the Avenger Family Standard",8,5 May 2014,"Continuing the second phase of Marvel's cinematic onslaught, begun several months prior with Iron Man 3, Thor's encore solo performance is a markedly stronger, more focused effort than his first. Though Earth still factors into the mix, particularly in the clever, gripping climactic fight scene, there's no mistaking that this is Asgard's story and that clear emphasis, missing from the original, makes a big difference. As a distinctly fantasy-laden epic, it also benefits from a fresh, authentic flavor that its stable-mates just can't match. There's more to see than smashed skyscrapers and flattened taxi cabs in Thor's world, and that brand of open possibility makes the realm an absolute delight to swallow up. As visual feasts go, this is at or near the top of the pile - it's gorgeous, innovative and generally unlike anything else in modern cinema, a stuffed bagful of sensory treats. The acting, too, has taken a grand step up since our last trip across the rainbow bridge. Surprisingly, this time Natalie Portman comes across as a clunky third wheel: Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston provide the real intrigue, hammering home Thor's complicated relationship with his conniving adopted brother, Loki. A fantastically imaginative flick, well-paced and triumphantly acted, that does something its precursor couldn't: whet my appetite for a sequel.",Thor - The Dark World
77,alindsay-al,A great sequel and a great addition to this universe.,8,20 April 2014,"I thought with Avengers 2 coming up I would rewatched Thor 2 and even though I didn't enjoy it as much as the first time I saw it it is still a great film and a great addition to this universe. The premise of this film sees the dark elves return to cover the universe in darkness using an old weapon. Thor, Jane foster and an unlikely ally attempt to stop the elves dark plan. Chris Hemsworth is well known for his role as Thor and he is great in the role and is a hero who I think can be loved by everybody. The supporting cast is a bit of a mixed bag, Tom Hiddleston returns as Loki and he is great in this film and really adds allot to the film. His chemistry with hemsworth is great and he is one villain that interests the audience. Anthony Hopkins is back as Odin and he is great in the role as the dad figure and wise figure even though he is also a little flawed in the film. I think ever since the star wars prequels Natalie Portman has struggled and she just didn't really fit in this or text first film and their relationship doesn't really have any feel to it or believability. Also Christopher Eccleston plays the head of the dark elves but I felt like he was underused and completely forgettable, which wasn't helped by the appearance of Loki. There was some interesting relationships in the film and some of the story felt well done. However, character motivations aren't revealed and the overall execution of the story feels weak. The script was really good with there being some good humour in the film and also the drama really worked in the film and helped make this film great. The style of the film was great, with all the action scenes being really good and the cgi of asgard looking better in this film. Overall I really like this film and think it is a great comic book film.",Thor - The Dark World
78,estebangonzalez10,Marvel Universe Season 2 Episode 2,6,8 November 2013,"""You must be truly desperate to come to me for help.""The second phase of the Marvel universe began this summer with Iron Man 3 which was a film I enjoyed very much, but really hasn't seemed to stick with me. I'm afraid the same problem can be said about Thor: The Dark World, which was an entertaining movie but I don't think I'd enjoy it as much on a second viewing. Most of these films are fun and exciting as you experience them for the first time, but the magic seems to vanish for me after a few weeks. Perhaps The Avengers was so great that these sequels don't seem to live up to the standard set by Joss Whedon. I still had a great time in the movies and enjoyed the sequel to Thor considering I wasn't blown away by the first film either. By now Thor knows exactly who he is and doesn't have to prove anything to anyone, so we get to see him in action with his might hammer quite a bit. At times the film has a sort of Star Wars vibe to it mixed with The Lord of the Rings (with Jane reminding me of Frodo), but the final action scene suffers from something we've seen in way too many superhero films recently: buildings getting completely destroyed and blown up. It also mixes some elements near the end that we've seen in Jumper, but all in all the film succeeds thanks to the great chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston. The way they played off each other and interacted was the highlight of the film, and Hiddleston was extremely funny here. I wasn't a huge fan of his in the first Thor, but after The Avengers I began to enjoy his performance, and his character in this sequel is better than ever. I wasn't blown away by the action scenes, but I did like the smaller comedic and light moments which the film had to offer. The film is entertaining enough to garner at least one watch.The film picks up after the events of The Avengers with Thor (Chris Hemsworth) back in Asgard serving his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) trying to restore peace to the nine realms that his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has altered. Loki is sentenced to prison after his mother Frigga (Rene Russo) insists he shouldn't be killed. It turns out to be a good decision because Thor will need his service after the city is attacked by a race of beings known as the Dark Elves. Their leader, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), is searching for a weapon known as the Aether which had been taken away from him thousands of years ago by Odin's father. Since the aether couldn't be destroyed, the Asgardians had to hide it. In the meantime Jane (Natalie Portman), who hasn't seen or heard from Thor since he left two years ago, along with her assistant Darcy (Kat Dennings) discover an anomaly very similar to the one that had brought Thor to Earth in the past. When she goes to investigate she is sucked by some sort of wormhole and ends up right next to the place where the aether had been hidden. After Heimdall (Idris Elba) warns Thor that Jane has disappeared, he goes after her, but somehow Jane has awaken Malekith which is what provoked his attack in Asgard in the first place.Thor: The Dark World is pretty generic and follows a similar formula of most superhero films. That is the reason why so many scenes remind us of other scenes we've seen in other action films. I was never at the edge of my seat during any of the action scenes, but I did have a great time with the light and funny moments. Some people actually enjoyed the action sequences in this film, but it really didn't do anything new for me. The highlight of the film for me was Tom Hiddleston and the scenes he was in were probably the most memorable of the movie. Jamie Alexander, Zachary Levi, and Ray Stevenson all return for their supporting roles here as Thor's soldier/warriors but their characters aren't really developed too much. It is strange to see a summer blockbuster film in November but I guess that the timing was right considering all the superhero films that came out this year. Thor doesn't stand out (and I guess none really did this year), but it is still an entertaining movie. This Marvel universe is growing so fast with all these films that at times it feels like a TV series. So I guess it was a good idea that they brought in the Game of Thrones director, Alan Taylor. He has made an enjoyable film.",Thor - The Dark World
79,iquine,Thin Story Thick CGI,6,27 August 2017,"(Flash Review)While I was entertained during the semi-serious action sequences, the script was too vague and at times discombobulated. The plot is that every 3,000 years five worlds align to allow for things to pass through. Some generic bad creature guys try to destroy or control the universe by using time and universe travel as well as some peculiar powers. Of course Thor and his hammer come to the rescue to stop them. There is a lot of fun brainless action and some fun with things and people zipping around the different worlds but much of it is just fun and games and doesn't advance the story and actually becomes severely redundant. The actress from 2 Broke Girls (I don't watch that sitcom!) adds sassy comedy but ultimately is a jarring addition and distracting. The bad creature guys were thinly developed as was the script so it ended up being Hollywood fluff.more than I thought it would be. Overall, it was fun but certainly not great.",Thor - The Dark World
80,Fluke_Skywalker,Thor? More like Bore,5,13 November 2013,"The Marvel factory rolls on, and the next widget down the assembly line is 'Thor: The Dark World'. Devoid of much of the wit, heart and character development that made the first 'Thor' a surprisingly solid stand-alone film, 'The Dark World' tries to skate along on its breathtaking visuals and the good will created by 'The Avengers'. It doesn't succeed. From its info-dump opening to its dull, drawn out finale, I never gave two Sifs about anything or anyone in this film.After this past Summer's dreadfully dull and lifeless 'Iron Man 3', Marvel's post-'Avengers' slate is now a big 0-2.

Meanwhile, evil Eccleston is after the evil red mist / force that is the Aether (the reality stone in another form) and Portman on earth soon gets caught up in this. Things converge.Probably the weakest of the MCU films largely because the plot is a bit baggy, Eccleston as written has zero personality and the Portman / Hemsworth passion play continues to fail to convince. On the positive side it's great fun, the usual dazzling effects and creatures are here and Hiddleston as Loki nearly steals this film as well.So worth seeing, just a bit of a mess. First post credit is worth hanging around for.",Thor - The Dark World
82,jimbo-53-186511,Slower than its predecessor and the darker tone adopted won't be to all tastes,5,11 April 2020,"Thousands of years ago The Dark Elves attempted to take control of the nine realms and plunge everything into darkness by using a deadly weapon known as Aether. Their attempts were unsuccessful as they were thwarted by the Asgard soldiers who were headed up by Odin's grandfather. In the present day, the dark elves are able to track down the Aether which has been embodied in scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) who is acting as its human host. With the dark elves closing in Thor finds himself called in to action once again not only to save Jane, but also to save the nine realms from the dark elves..Replicating the quality of the first film was always going to be difficult as Kenneth Branagh (who was the surprise director of the first film) brought about pretty much every quality that one would come to expect in a superhero film. I did expect a slight drop in quality with this sequel truth be told, but Thor: The Dark World, sadly, for me, represented more than a slight drop in quality I'm afraid...There are 2 major problems with this film; the first problem is that it is comparatively slower paced than the first film (which is odd because both films are roughly the same length). It does take its time to get going and even when it does it just isn't as involving as the narrative in the first film - Thor being banished from Asgard and forced to live on Midgard (or Earth as its otherwise known) made for a much more humourous and endearing scenario which sadly isn't replicated in this film. The 'supposed' comic relief character here comes is Ian - a nerdy intern guy, but through a combination of poor acting and woeful dialogue he fails to be funny or make any positive impact on the film. The second problem lies with the darker tone which takes away all of the cheekiness that we saw in the first film; Thor had loads of good lines in the first film, but here he is only treated to the odd humourous line and most of the time these funny lines involve scenes with Loki. The darker tone would have worked better if the villains of the piece were developed better, but they are not making the film feel a little hollow at its centre.The performances from the main players very much reflect the material in comparison to the first film; toned down and not quite as good. Hemsworth was brilliant in the first film, but mostly because he was served better in that film. In this film, he mostly comes off as being stiff and uncomfortable. Skarsgard is crazy for most of the film which wasn't pleasant to watch and this wackiness didn't seem to serve much purpose in the film. Everyone else (performance wise) played out more or less the same as they did in the original film.In summary then director Alan Taylor has made a bit of a mess of this sequel; the darker tone takes away a lot of the things that made the original film work so well and with a padded out story and underdeveloped villains the film never has much of a spark or feeling of urgency about it which the original film had in abundance. I must admit to having a real sense of elation when I got to the end of Thor which I did not have at the end of Thor: The Dark World. This sequel is by no means a bad film, but at the same time it isn't in the same league as the first film.",Thor - The Dark World

85,dwpollar,Technically superb Thor sequel that is missing a heart...,5,6 December 2013,"1st watched 12/4/2013 – 5 out of 10(Dir-Alan Taylor): Technically superb Thor sequel that is missing a heart or a reason to care. Visually this movie has a lot to offer, but about halfway thru a realization comes that the fluff isn't enough to sustain a seasoned movie-goer. I had a similar reaction to the Harrison Ford epic ""Blade Runner"" and other movies that have a lot of style, but very little heart. The story revolves around a matter hidden deep beneath the Earth called ""Ether"" that can change compositions quickly and is sought after by an evil elf-like creature from a world before there was light, Aka. The Dark World. He believes this Ether has the power to bring back his world. Natalie Portman, plays Jane Foster, a companion of Thor and a scientist – who comes upon this substance during an investigation and it possesses her. The evil creature is then after her and Thor(played by Chris Hemsworth), and he, of course, wants to protect her. The settings in the movie consist of Asgard – ruled by Thor's father Odin(played by Anthony Hopkins), London, and the dark elves' world.the movie jumps back and forth between these worlds partially because of a weird warp found during the investigation that transfers items across these worldsbut Thor seems to be able to go in and out no matter what. There is plenty of action to be had, decent acting, and a little humor but other than the expected battle between good vs. evil there is no real reason or emotion to stay with the movie to the very end. The movie should probably win some visual effects awards, but I'm looking for a complete experience and in my opinion – this isn't one. It is a good try but not quite good enough for my approval.",Thor - The Dark World

87,3xHCCH,Its Sense of Humor Is The Spark!,7,30 October 2013,"In the beginning, there was a all powerful dark force called The Aether. The powers on Asgaard contain this force and keep it hidden for thousands of years, only to be found by none other than astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). When The Aether takes possession of Jane, of course, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) comes to her rescue. However, as Asgaard and the Nine Realms face the resurgence of the Dark Elves led by the diabolical Malakeith (Christopher Eccleston), a catastrophic planetary alignment threatens to end the existence of the whole world. Thor was forced to solicit his incarcerated renegade brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to help him with his elaborate rescue plan. Can the two estranged brothers actually work for one common goal?Honestly the first hour of this new Thor film was so dark it was almost dull. The computer-generated special effects looked so fake and unimpressive, very obviously cartoonish mayhem. The acting can be so hokey and corny, so serious and heavy-handed despite the emptiness of the story. The plot itself is very familiar, and reminiscent of many other superhero films. The romantic scenes of Natalie Portman wearing a gown felt like scenes in a ""Star Wars"" prequel.But there was that sudden turn around midway in the film when Thor and Loki joined up that the film snapped into place and never looked back up to the very end. The second half came alive because of its quirky sense of humor. These boisterous moments were largely due to the characters of the eccentric Dr. Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), Jane's cute intern Darcy (Kat Dennings), and Darcy's own dorky intern Ian (Jonathan Howard). I feel these funny moments saved this film from wallowing in self-seriousness. They may seem so out of place, yet they were still so laugh-out-loud hilarious.However, are these funny scenes really what director Alan Taylor wants us to remember this movie for? The brotherly interaction between Thor and Loki should have been the main focus, but this can be buried under so many other less-important computer-generated details that tend to overwhelm this production. In any case, overall, this film turned out very entertaining superhero action film that audiences will enjoy. You may not really be able to fully understand how the fight action went from realm to realm in the climactic battle but these were exhilarating to see. The artwork in stark red and black with broad brush strokes over the final credits were awesome to look at.

Thor takes her to Asgard and Odin finally reveals what all this is about. The evil Elves who want this force invade Asgard and close all exit portals trapping the gods. By using this force, the Aether, they can destroy the universe and let nothingness rule. That forces Thor and his sidekicks to join forces with the imprisoned Loki. But can they trust Loki? Long CGI carnage ensues between the Asgardians and the Elves, Loki, Thor and the main villain. It's no mystery who wins the battle. We get several instances of Asgardian politics- Thor's insecurity of being the ruler, Loki's ambition, and Odin's wisdom. At the end we're left with...questions to be answered by part 3 I guess.Thor I was beautiful, captivating, fascinating, visually and story-wise. Thor II just falls flat. Almost entirely without charm, it teaches us nothing new about the Norse world. Relationships don't matter here all that much and Loki gets slapped by some girl. It took 3 writers to come up with this weak story that's just there to justify hundreds of millions wasted in dull CGI battles. And what better way to ruin a good thing than by hiring a director with near zero experience in movies and hand him the (formerly) strongest of the superhero franchises so far. Thor II is disappointment. These movies have gone into industrial mode, are being cranked out by the dozen now without regard to quality, anyone who's got time is hired to direct. A shame, but typical greedy cynical Hollywood behavior. Hopefully someone who actually cares will take control of Thor III before they start hiring rappers and Bruce Willis to act, try to sell us some lame soundtrack, and let Thor become a copy of Transformers 8.",Thor - The Dark World
89,aidanratesmovies,"Production Issues aside, this is still a decent movie",8,25 June 2021,"Feeling a bit uninspired- but entertaining nevertheless, Thor The Dark World takes a darker stance on the mythology and world of the titular character- and certainly does not deserve the hate it so often receives. Many people consider this film the worst MCU flick, but honestly I just feel it's rather average. Due to being pressed for time and bad reception in independent groupings, Marvel struggled to make the release date for this film with its fast paced editing- and I feel oddly enough thats the films biggest downfall. It isn't a bad film in the slightest, but the editing throughout feels a bit rushed and the monotonous tone it gives throughout just gives the film a rather bland vibe. It could have easily been a strongly toned film, with its nightmarish dark imagery throughout, but it feels like Disney wasn't able to compile the film in the best way in time for it to reach the potential it had. That being said, I enjoyed the film for what it was. It was interesting to watch, and it takes its story very seriously, of which I found to be interesting- despite it being a much slower pace than the first. The acting is very well done, and the look of the film is incredible. Between the imagery, set design, and costumes- you will effortlessly be impressed by all the style of this film alone- which is brilliantly conceived. In the end, it's the editing that weighs this film down as a whole, making it glimmer instead of purely shining like it could have. It's far from bad, but it could have easily been a lot more, given some extra time and money.My Rating: 7.8/10.",Thor - The Dark World
90,Amari-Sali,"Thor is very much an action/ comedy but, like most Marvel films, it has a sense of interdependency in which the hero is nothing without their allies.",8,10 November 2013,"Let me start off right the bat saying I wasn't originally going to see this movie. This is despite me loving Marvel franchises like X-Men and Spiderman, but for whatever reason those who comprise the Avengers just never screamed, ""see me opening weekend!"" for reasons I don't understand. Still, for the sake of getting out the house I saw this and was sort of surprised by the end result.Characters & StoryAs many know, Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth) is the god of thunder and the hero of the film. Alongside him is his love interest Jane (played by Natalie Portman) who is an astrophysicist who, like most love interest, act as much as a liability as an asset; then we have the scene commanding Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston) who often is the most interesting character in the film since he has good action scenes, comedic moments, and brings many questions to the story; then there is the last big character of the film, to me anyway, the villain Malakith (played by Christopher Exxleston) who is sort of your generic villain hell-bent on destroying the world, without any unique traits to make him stand out amongst the many villains of the Marvel universe. Outside of those mentioned, there is Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins) who is Thor's father and king of Asgard; Heimdall (played by Idris Elba) who seems to be the watcher of the various realms Asgard rules over; and then there is Darcy (played by Kat Dennings) who I only mention since she and Loki brings the majority of the laughs in the film.Now, in terms of story, they first establish, especially for people like me, the power and might of Thor as he tries to unite all the realms. Then, and this is not in exact order, we watch Jane try to move on from Thor, and do research, which leads her to discovering something called ""The Aether"" a magic mist which has the power to return the world to darkness, the way it was assumingly before the big bang. Her discovery of this magic awakens Malekith and leads Thor to bringing her to Asgard to be protected but, being that this movie has to fill nearly two hours, naturally they beat the hell out of Thor and Asgard, and then bring in Loki to help get revenge. From there, things are taken to Earth and then the final battle goes back and forth between Earth and The Dark World.PraiseSomething you'll find in 90% of all Marvel films, and most comic book adaptations nowadays, is there is a mix of comedy, drama and some comedic moments. For Thor: The Dark World, they do a tightrope balance of all three and do so with the type of skill which seems almost unnatural. The reason I say that is I haven't seen the first, but watching this made me feel like I was watching an action/ comedy which easily could slip into dramedy, and then back. The comedy itself though was a real highlight for Loki and Darcy made it so those maybe not into the action of Thor story got a few laughs, and then the action had mutilations, epic scenery and sometimes I felt I was watching a Dragon Ball Z crossover. Perhaps though the best thing was the writing when it came to Loki. Needless to say, as much as this film made Hemsworth the star amongst his brothers, Hiddleston is the true breakout star in my opinion, and the movie takes full advantage of his talents. Be it his comedic moments, dramatic moments, or the air of mystery they put in what happens to him, you are left with questions which perhaps can only be answered in another sequel.CriticismWhich leads to the handful of criticism that can be given to this movie, of which there is very few. Perhaps the one big criticism is the villain has no personality and though he does something which involves killing a major character, at the same time you can understand why other franchises like X-Men and Spiderman came before Thor since based off this villain alone, it makes it seem like you have this great hero, but no formidable opponents to really challenge him. Then, I must admit that while I liked the action scenes, I did feel the comedy took away a bit from the some of the scenes. For, even in the final fight, they take a comedic break and then the action goes on once more. It makes it so, for me, it seems like they were trying to make the film so universally likable, they took away from what perhaps is the main selling point.Overall: Worth SeeingI'll admit, after seeing this I do wanna see the first, even if just for Loki. For, this film may not be on the iconic status like The Dark Knight, but it sets out to entertain you and does just that. Then, as an added bonus, it has some diversity. There are villains and heroes which are a good mix of people of color and different genders, and the mere view of the worlds they live in is awe-inspiring. Lastly, I must mention there are two post credit scenes. One which is worth waiting for, and the very last one, at the end of all the cast and crew, which isn't a big deal.",Thor - The Dark World

92,Spondonman,"Me Thor, you Jane",7,9 August 2014,"It sure was Dark all right, they weren't wrong there. It's as well to remember this is Marvel-Disney; so what if there's the odd mix of dark menace and light-hearted frivolity, it's only a motion picture after all. I enjoyed the first Thor but the second was even more stylish and enjoyable if weighed down by even more nonsense-science.Er, basically primeval dark forces attack Asgard – and Greenwich, London – pretty obviously via gravity space-time wormholes, Thor's girlfriend Jane is accidentally invested with a sinister Mcguffin power that is chased after by the head baddie (whose physog reminded me of a young Davros from Dr Who), Thor doesn't trust Loki and Loki doesn't blame him, and cartoon bones and concrete are crunched remorselessly from the off. On the way to the crackers climax Thor obediently hangs his hammer up on a handy coat rack and decides to catch a handy tube to get to the final battle in time. Light comedic touches like those always go down well with me, I love panache when trying sell a ridiculous plot or watching a film revelling in brazen brainlessness. It's also the first film I've ever seen to contain a last minute killer twist, then a sinister teaser for the next film, and finally a droll comedy moment to end on but one that would definitely have dire implications for anyone happening to be walking by at that moment! As with the first film I thought Tom Hiddleston stole the show, and Idris Elba had a marvellously enigmatic character to portray. And again, the serious reason for some of the warring sides to fight with swords and some with guns escapes me, as it did at 11 years old reading Edgar Rice Burroughs' Martian series. The cgi cartoonery seemed perfect to me, capturing flawless vistas of other worlds and impressive violence alike to these old eyes.The kids would probably make much more sense of it all than I could, and maybe even follow the swift impenetrably dark battles successfully – me, I went along with it in the right spirit and thoroughly enjoyed it. I mean why bother giving it a chance at all unless you want it to work?",Thor - The Dark World
93,masonsaul,Great but not as good as the first,8,18 July 2019,"Thor: The Dark World is a great sequel but it isn't as good as the previous Thor. Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman once again give great performances and Tom Hiddleston is reliably perfect. The CG is good and the action is enjoyable. There's some surprises in the narrative and emotional scenes. The music by Brian Tyler is really good. Unfortunately, the film wastes Christopher Eccleston as an extremely forgettable villain.",Thor - The Dark World
94,davidmvining,"There's no color left, nor fun",2,25 November 2019,"They took all that was good of Thor, sapped all of the color out of it, clothed it in darkness, and grounded it in a more recognizable reality. That process made it so much more boring.Gone are the operatic tones and performances. Gone are scenes of father and son yelling at each other over big things in large sets with bright colors. Instead we get father and son arguing under their breaths about things in dark rooms with ""realistic"" performances. It's such a drab drag of a film.First we get a prologue about the Dark Elves who fought Asgardians five thousand years before when the Dark Elves tried to put the entire universe into darkness. They, of course, failed, and will surely never be mentioned again. Just ahead 5,000 years, and it's two years after Thor had visited Earth, and some undetermined amount of time after Thor had his little adventure in New York, the nine realms have been thrown into chaos and Thor helps to tamp down on rebellions and plunderings. Thor has succeeded enough that now there is talk of him returning to Earth for the first time since the last time he went to Earth and didn't see his sort of girlfriend Jane Foster.Jane Foster, in order to justify her mere presence in the movie, falls into a random hole that takes her directly to where the aether is, the mystical substance that was going to darken the universe at the hands of the Dark Elves five thousand years prior. The aether inhabits her and sends her back to Earth. It is unclear if this was a random occurrence or if the aether is somehow intelligent with agency (I'm leaning towards random since the aether does nothing else on its own in the film). Thor takes her back to Asgard where the Asgardians are amazed by the aether's presence but have no idea what to do. The only one who knows what to do are the Dark Elves (Surprise! They're back!), who have been in hibernation for the past five thousand years and wake up that very day. Probably because they have some sort of aether detecting peace of fantasy tech that can detect the substance across vast distances instantaneously. Or, they came out of hibernation a couple of days before the event from five thousand years before is going to repeat. Or something. The Dark Elves and their motives are really unclear.I'm sorry. This movie was tough to sit through. It's garbage from beginning to end. The plot doesn't matter because it makes no sense. Much like Iron Man 2, I was left constantly asking myself as I watched, ""What is the story of this movie?"" I mean, what's Thor's emotional journey in this? It seems like it's actually about his relationship with Loki, but Loki disappears for more than an hour, having nothing to do with the movie at all for almost two-thirds of the film's runtime. The Dark Elf plot feels like a serial adventure while the stuff with Loki (which was added late in the process after people loved him in The Avengers) is the actual meat of the emotional journey. It's a rather stark juxtaposition. But even then, the ""meat"" is given almost no real time to develop before Loki ""dies"" again and we're off to the film's climax.Now, I'm not one to nitpick things not conforming to reality, or even to a film's own established rules on smaller things. My focus is on character and theme. If those things are going well, I tend to be more forgiving of stupid nonsense. However, when the basic tenets of storytelling are being shredded through sheer incompetence, these bits of idiocy bug me more and more. For instance, the portals that seem to follow no rules whatsoever and become so important late in the movie. Well, they don't follow any discernable logic. I think that's the point, but when fights to the death turn based on this randomness, it doesn't feel like randomness, it feels like a screenwriter trying to be clever while also giving his characters easy outs of tough situations.This makes me kind of sad. Thor was one of the bright spots of Phase 1, and Thor: The Dark World is probably the worst movie of the franchise.",Thor - The Dark World
95,jadepietro,Sci-Fi Norsesense,4,20 November 2013,"￼This film is not recommended.Thor is back but, this time around, it felt like a visit to the Bizarro World rather than a journey to the dark world as the title proclaims. Everything that I truly enjoyed in the first installment of this franchise had an oddly opposite reaction for me in Thor: The Dark World. Everything in this latest installment seemed out of kilter from its entertaining 2011 predecessor. (However, it was during the film that I did have a full out-of-body experience: I so wanted to take this body out of the theater, away from the stifling boredom and unending disengagement of all the silly action and sci-fi mythos, but dear moviegoers, I dutifully fought that urge.)In Thor: The Dark World, the comic banter is missing (with only one laugh total), as is the beefcake factor (with only one shirtless interlude). With this sequel, everything seems terribly oppressive. In his battle to save Earth, Thor must battle a new villain, Malekith (played one- dimensionally by Christopher Eccleston). Malekith is the leader of the Dark Elves, a group of mutant warriors bent on world destruction (what else?) with the help of a weapon of mass destruction called the Aether (pronounced ether). As with the first film, the film bounces from one battle scene on either a desolate planet or an Art Deco wonderland. Whenever the action takes place on Planet Asgard, the film has recharged energy and strong action footage, whereas, when we go to Planet Earth, the film bogs down and lands with a thud.Chris Hemsworth, who was so much fun when we first met him as Thor, plays the role all too seriously. He's still an earnest hero, but that fish out of water conceit is no more. (And it was that premise which helped achieve the film's unique and special charm in the first outing.) Natalie Portman is wasted in her role as his astrophysicist gal pal. The wonderful chemistry between these actors playing Thor and Jane that once was is no more. Now Jane is a cute harpy and Thor goes from hunk to lunk. At least, he still has that magic hammer and knock- out abs. Hopkins, who was solid before as Odin, is now all ham and he never quite passes the muster. Such fine actors as Ray Stephenson, Idris Elba, Rene Russo, Kat Dennings, and Stellan Skarsgard are underused in minor roles. Only Tom Hiddleston as Thor's jealous and evil sibling, Loki, has the campy menace and star presence to make this film sequel-worthy.The CGI is more than adequate as is Alan Taylor's direction. A few action sequences are well staged while others are inessential time fillers. Like the mighty Aether, the numerous and loud sci-fi action numbs the senses and only dulls the pain. The screenplay by Christopher L. Yost, Christopher Markus, and Stephen McFeely is more convoluted than necessary with too much exposition spent on the Norse sci-fi background or establishing the next fight scene instead of developing characters and motives. Thor: The Dark World just seems needlessly strung together from one battle sequence to the next, as Thor, Jane, and the gang travel from one portal dimension to the next anomaly. The film plays more like an expensive video game than it does a real movie. Boring.As superhero movies go, the film is a minor disappointment. Marvel's Thor: The Dark World is no marvel at all. It's just more of the same, and not really all that interesting. GRADE: CANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",Thor - The Dark World
96,Sherazade,Good not great,7,8 May 2014,"You can tell a lot of money was spent on this sequel to Thor (2011) but unfortunately as with tradition this sequel (like most sequels) does not live up to its original film and its sad because they had a very fleshy plot to play around with plus veritable villains to boot.First things first, this is either the first film or at least the first film in my recent memory that I've seen where the main villain was given so little to do. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) the secondary villain did his part and shined doing so but Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) king of the the dark elves was just wasted in his role in spite of him seeming so sinister and ruthlessly wicked in his introduction and initial scenes.Another footfall was the level of authenticity of Jane Foster's (Natalie Portman) possession, I mean she seemed possessed but if the great power within her was as strong as it was described by Odin (Anthony Hopkins) then it should have been shown to all but consume her and she should have been given some scenes in which she went over to the dark side and wreaked so much havoc. Sure she caused the death of Frigga (Rene Russo) but it wasn't an insidious act brought about by her possession. And speaking of Frigga, her funeral was one of the most beautiful send-offs ever captured on celluloid, just wish her sons would have mourned her properly and ruthlessly avenged her death. Darcy (Kat Dennings) Jane's trusty sidekick was her usual funny self but there was something off with her acting and even her humor at times. Kenneth Branagh really did a great job in directing her in part 1 where she was on her top game but unfortunately Alan Taylor was unable to capture the essence of this funny and witty character, instead he made her look hapless.Finally, for those who haven't seen 'Marvel's The Avengers' I suggest you do before watching this because there are so many references to the film during the course of 'Thor: The Dark World' that you might find yourself lost at times or at least wondering what they are on about. Though I will say that if you stayed for until the credits of 'Thor' finished rolling, you'll get a sense of why Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) is the way he is in this film.",Thor - The Dark World
97,invisibleunicornninja,Pretty boring.,3,6 April 2018,"This movie is pretty boring but at the same time its watchable. I spent the whole runtime waiting for some real excitement. In the end, I feel like I wasted my time. Sure, there are much worse movies I could've watched, but this was just boring. Plot - The first Thor movie suffered from being extremely rushed, this one suffers from being too slow. Most of the scenes could've been trimmed down or removed. This movie goes on far too long. The plot is dumb and there are many elements that could've been explained if this movie wanted to be more entertaining. Overall, this whole movie is formulaic and overlong. Characters - None of the characters are very interesting other than maybe Thor and Loki. All the acting is good, but the dialogue and the character actions aren't that great. A lot of the characters are actually pretty dumb, and many are severely underdeveloped, making the long runtime even worse. Effects - Most of the visual effects are convincing and very well done. The cinematography is pretty good - nothing fantastic. Sound Design - I don't think that this movie has any music. Maybe one or two scenes - but for the most part the only sounds are those of the characters talking, and whatever is happening in the scene. There's nothing wrong with this, but I just wanted to point it out. It also might have something to do with how boring this movie is. There are a lot of dull fight scenes that could've benefited from some dramatic music. Fight Scenes - The fight scenes may be well-choreographed, but they're boring.Logic - This movie is full of continuity errors and unexplained devices. It just makes the film that much more unwatchable.",Thor - The Dark World
98,pc95,Sitcomish Humor Drags at This Sequel,6,7 December 2013,"Not directed by Kenneth Branagh, ""Thor: The Dark World"", seems to suffer for it. The problem which really made the movie turgid was awful over- usage of of sitcom 1-liner humor trying to play off as wit. Rather there at least a dozen ""joke"" lines that are feeble, unimaginative, and make you wonder if you're watching a super-hero movie or a Thursday night made-for- TV outing. I don't understand how this kind of script gets green-lit, devoid of intelligence or editing. The other issue for me is the dull yacking of characters for about the first 30 min of the movie - GET ON WITH IT filmmakers - stop trying to describe a movie through dialog - show it happening! Looking past these, the movie starts to take off finally for the 2nd 2/3 of runtime. It does not have the focus, soundtrack, wit, and direction of it's predecessor. Give it about a 6.5/10 closer to a 6 maybe. Could've been much better.",Thor - The Dark World
99,yoggwork,Further improve the cosmology,6,20 February 2019,"Further improve the cosmology, but the bad thing is that when multiple heroes are linked together, if the front is one or two, there will be some hindrances that can not be understood.

To be honest this movie is better then the first Thor movie by far. Honestly this movie isn't as bad as Iron Man 3. This movie does clearly show what happened to Loki after the first avengers. By the end credits of the movie we learn that Loki was never really dead he was just discussed as Odin the whole time which never really made any sense but still. Any ways this movie isn't as bad a critics say it is.",Thor - The Dark World
101,brando647,A Solid Improvement Over the Original THOR,8,14 July 2014,"I may be alone in this opinion but I believed Kenneth Branagh's THOR was the weakest film in the first phase of Marvel films. Yes, even weaker than IRON MAN 2. It wasn't that I hated the film but it failed to leave any sort of impression on me. Thor was always going to be one of the more difficult characters for Marvel to bring to the big screen. As opposed to characters with more ""grounded"" (in the loosest sense of the term) origins, Thor is a more mystical being. He's a demigod from another dimension who's near invulnerable to most forms of damage. So, right off the bat, he's not the easiest to relate to. So the first film went the route of a ""fish- out-of-water"" scenario as Thor loses his Asgardian powers and is banished to Earth to learn his lesson. So he spends a nice portion of the movie without actually being a superhero and we spend it on Earth. You know, that place we've spent every other Marvel movie to that point despite Marvel having a rich mythology with countless other possibilities. So, yeah, THOR was enjoyable but forgettable. But THE DARK WORLD corrects for these past weaknesses and actually brought us a Thor movie that I really enjoyed. The movie begins following the events of THE AVENGERS, with Loki condemned to the Asgardian dungeon for his crimes and Thor struggling to clean up the mess his brother's defiance had created across the Nine Realms.So, for starters, that's a major bonus in this film. We get a nice glimpse of realms other than Asgard, Earth, and Jotunheim. We even get to visit Vanaheim and Svartalfheim. So finally, the Thor films spread their wings a bit and we spend very little time on Earth this time around. It gave the filmmakers opportunities to have some fun with the production design. We get a much grander view of Asgard. It doesn't necessarily look as polished this time around. The first film made Asgard out to be very polished and shiny while THE DARK WORLD gives it a more tactile appearance with stone constructs and shady taverns. Svartalfheim is nothing more than a desolate wasteland with dark sands and a bizarre greenish atmosphere. It is the home of the film's villains, the Dark Elves. With their ruler, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston, the Dark Elves have been around since the creation of our universe and once thrived in the darkness before it's creation. Since the arrival of our universe and the light it brought, the Elves have been fighting for a means of eliminating it to return the universe to ever-lasting darkness. They'd been defeated once before by the Asgardians, under the command of Thor's grandfather Bor. They are awaken from their slumber once again when Jane Foster (Natalie Portman, returning) stumbles across the MCU's latest mystical artifact, the Aether. We never really get a good idea of what the Aether does. We're just told that it's incredibly powerful and Malekith can somehow use it to bring darkness across the Nine Realms during a cosmic event known as the Convergence when all of the realms align.There's our first misstep. The Aether is poorly explained. We see that it has some pretty nifty powers but their never really defined. It's just a shapeless mass of red liquid that provides its owner with seemingly unlimited power. We know these films are bound to have MacGuffins but do we need to treat them so shoddily? Give us some history, some detail. Malekith is obsessed with it and, again, that's about as much detail we get on another important aspect of the story. There have been a lot of complaints about Malekith being underdeveloped and I can't say I entirely disagree. We have a basic motivation and that's about it. He wants to return the universe to darkness and he'll stop at nothing to accomplish it, but give us some more. There has to be more to him. He seems like such a cool character. He could've easily been one of the better MCU villains with some extra time spent getting to know him, but he's relegated to a single mindless goal. The Dark Elves seem to be a very proud people and their talented warriors. There's some history there, so give us a bit. I love their visual style. The black and white color scheme and emotionless face masks give them a wicked creepy appearance. And Kurse is probably the best creature design in any of the films. Director Alan Taylor and his team nailed it with the film's visuals.The cast is mostly fantastic as well. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston inhabit their roles at this point better than I can imagine anyone else would. There's a great brotherly chemistry between them and each of them have grown over the MCU series. Thor has become the noble warrior he was destined to be, surpassing even his father in his tact and strength. Loki continues to reign as one of Marvel's best movie villains and he's given a chance to show a more compassionate side when tragic events give him a reason to fight alongside his brother. Natalie Portman continues to prove that she's just not quite meant for comic movies. I know she's got talent but she always comes across as wooden as Jane in these movies. Kat Dennings returns as unnecessary comic relief and, while I was fine with her excessive goofiness in the first movie, it wasn't really needed here. THE DARK WORLD is a more serious film than it's predecessor and I would've been fine with the little bit of humor that comes through the Thor/Loki interactions. Christopher Eccleston and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje are wasted potential as the baddies but they do the best with the limited material they're given.In the end, THE DARK WORLD is a great sequel to a decent film and helped solidify Marvel's second phase of films as an improvement.",Thor - The Dark World
102,bob-rutzel-1,It was okay. Watchable,5,11 March 2014,"The Dark Elves want to destroy and shut out the light from the Universe. Their leader, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) searches for the Aether, an indestructible force and finds it in Jane (Natalie Portman). Say what? Thor (Chris Hemsworth) must find a way to save Jane and defeat the Dark Elves. Thor needs the help of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who is in prison by order of his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins).This was okay, but the CGI sets showcased all you see and they are spectacular. The action scenes are very good. The only comedic lines were uttered by Loki and to be truthful Loki steals the show. I suppose the professor running naked at the Stonehenge site was funny to some, not to me. It wasn't funny and didn't add much to the story. Why have it? Not much happens between Thor and Jane although she had been waiting for his return for 2-years. This was okay, but the Convergence when the 9-Realms line up to a point when Malekith can use the Aether to destroy the known universe should have made us pause and be concerned, but that didn't happen. Things happened too fast and we knew Thor would be triumphant. It's really not good to say that we just didn't care, but we didn't. This was okay, but for a civilization as advanced like the Asgards their weapons of choice only seemed to be knives and swords and we did see the Dark Elves use what looked like ray-guns. Oh, yes, Thor has his Hammer. Knives and swords? Give me a break. This was okay only because of the action scenes and sets design and they were very good. Now for the dilemma: Two people die in this. What will a sequel bring us without them? One is kind of important to the Thor story. Huh? However, there is that scene at the very end that confused me and may confuse you too. (5/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",Thor - The Dark World
103,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"A decent and entertaining sequel, ""Thor: The Dark World"" is a lot of fun, but can't quite measure up to its predecessors.",7,23 February 2014,"In 2011, I was given a very decent surprise by the Marvel release ""Thor"", the fourth entry in ""Phase One"" of the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe."" (The overall franchise including characters like Iron Man, the Hulk, Captain America and Thor, all leading to the ""Avengers"" films) I wasn't sure what to expect going in, as the character seemed far too different from prior films in the franchise. ""How could this work?"", I would ask myself. But I'm glad I took the chance- I was blown away by the imagination, humor and wonderful storytelling. And it ended up being one of my favorite ""Phase One"" films.So I went into ""Thor: The Dark World"" with decently high expectations. The first film was such fun, I couldn't wait for the second. And how did it measure up? Unfortunately, it doesn't quite match the high quality of the character's previous outings in ""The Avengers"" and his 2011 titular film. However, despite that, it was still a very decent, humorous and very fun continuation of the character's story, and is well worth seeing for fans of the character and franchise.The story centers on Thor (duh), as he struggles with a number of situations, all leading to the possible destruction of the universe. After being re-united with his beloved Jane, Thor realizes her body has been inadvertently infused with ""Aether"", a powerful force that could potentially spell doom for all existence. Forced to protect her from a treacherous Dark Elf lord named Malekith, Thor will need to forge an uneasy alliance with his imprisoned brother Loki in order to save the known universe from Malekith's evil plans.As was the case in the first film, the cast is fantastic. Chris Hemsworth is blast as the hero Thor, this time showing more range and emotion than prior outings, making him more identifiable and compelling. Natalie Portman is also great as Jane, though I will comment that despite having a lot to do in the film, she doesn't have a lot of depth, making her feel tacked on at times, and as though she's only there to drive the plot forward. Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgard as Jane's companions Darcy and Selvig are an absolute joy, being more or less the comedic relief, as is newcomer Jonathan Howard as Darcy's new intern, Ian. Anthony Hopkins and Renee Ruso add a lot of class to the proceedings as Thor's parents, Odin and Frigga. Christopher Ecclestan is adequately threatening as Malekith, though he feels a bit under- developed. And supporting roles by the likes of Jamie Alexander, Ray Stephenson and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje are all very well-played, making good work in their secondary roles. But as before, the real show- stealer is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. He is just such a breath of fresh air, and gives such a compelling performance that he almost always overshadows everyone else. A truly remarkable performer.The script by Christopher Yost, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (based on a story co-written by the late Don Payne) is where some of my issues lie. It's not a bad script by any means. It's tightly paced, has some great sequences, and generally had something for every character to do. It also has some surprisingly hard- hitting scenes of emotion that surprised me. But I just feel that it leaves some characters under-developed. And it felt like a far smaller story as a result. (Even though it's larger in scope, it feels like less is happening.)Directorial duties are handed off this time to Alan Taylor, best known as a television director, though he has a few feature films to his credit. And I think he did a serviceable job in this film, with a strong visual sensibility and a keen eye for visual storytelling. Though I do feel that his work as a television director does show in some sequences, particularly early on. While the film is mostly theatrical, a few action sequences do have a slight ""tv- aesthetic"", though I could forgive them as they were few and far between. That being said, I did prefer Kenneth Branagh's direction in the first film a bit more. His more operatic, even slightly melodramatic style just fit the tone better, in my opinion.The rest of the production is top-notch though. The costume and set design is shockingly beautiful as it was before. The different worlds are clearly defined, and it seems a lot of care, research and detail was put into every aspect, lending credibility to the overall story. The cinematography was also something to behold, and I particularly loved the lighting. And the visual effects are astounding. Some of the best CGI work I've seen lately. Even when I knew the things on-screen weren't real, I still ""believed"" they were there. The only thing I think fell a bit short was the musical score by Brian Tyler. It just wasn't memorable, and although it fit the mood, it felt generic. Whereas in the first movie, I found myself recalling the gorgeous musical cues and even humming them to myself... here, it's just sort of generic swords-and-sorcery fare. A lot of drums and horns. And a few appearances of what I liked to call the ""Hans Zimmer 'Bwwwaaahhh'."" That loud, deep noise that has been popular over the past 5 or so years, that just sort-of sounds like someone shouting ""Bwwwaaahhh"" with a deep voice whenever something big happens on-screen.However, although I feel like I was pointing out a lot of negatives, there's still many positives here too appreciate. The action is great, the cast wonderful and the humor a blast. It's still a darned fun, entertaining film, and worth seeing for fans... it just isn't quite as good as it could have been.I give ""Thor: The Dark World"" a pretty-good 7 out of 10. Worth seeing for fans, but it probably won't win any new viewers.",Thor - The Dark World
104,quincytheodore,An amusing and simply a better sequel.,7,2 November 2013,"While it possesses a predictably uninspiring plot almost every superhero movies use, Thor: The Dark World manages to be entertaining due to its clever script, great chemistry between the cast and amazing visual presentation. It improves on the original with larger action sequences and smoother, more appealing and more elegant scenes. At heart, the relationships between characters are amusing to watch, especially the dysfunction brotherhood of Thor and Loki, much to Tom Hiddleston's credit.It opens up slightly plain with monologue explanation of a banished ancient race that made an ominous weapon, was defeated in way and ultimately swore vengeance upon Asgard, which harrowingly feels all too similar to Superman's nemesis, amongst others. It then reintroduces the characters and how they fare after the events from the first movie. With Thor's concern over his duty and longing for Jane, the first half is a bit mundane. It does gradually become much more compelling with good acting and light yet efficient humor. Dialogues are funny, presented at timely occasions and don't feel forced. There lies sincere playful moments; more than most movies of its kind has to offer.Acting from the cast is charming. Chris Hemsworth seems more comfortable as Thor. He shows a fairly natural performance and it coincides well as the character itself becomes more mature. Natalie Portman as Jane is decent, but she's still somewhat trapped in the damsel in distress role. Tom Hiddleston performs wonderfully as Loki, still looking mighty treacherous but has a hint of redemption this time around. It's good to see both brothers interact with each other as that is one of the best moments of the movie.As expected from a blockbuster movie, it delivers quite well on its depiction of alien worlds intertwined with Earth. Asgard has abundance of tiny details, from its gadgetry, garment to mishmash of traditional Viking and futuristic housing. Color palette has changed from the first's dusky set of New Mexico to more cloudy grayish skyline of London. Nifty spectacles are spread throughout, battles are fought exotically and the clash of colors is enchanting. Its 3D effect has reasonably vivid impact, it won't impede the visual, in fact adds to the enjoyment.Thor: The Dark World is simply a better sequel.

Both ""Superman Returns"" and ""Man of Steel"" have more merit, and that's stretching things! Watch it for the two hot girls and pumped up Chris. Watch it for the over-the-top computer graphics. Check your brain at the door. I didn't even enjoy ""Guardians of the Universe"" that much. I guess I am having SFX overload. Think of how much better even Superman III-IV could have been with all these mindless explosions! I was tired after watching the first hour of this mess. Everything in the last half was totally predictable. Where did ""Papa Thor"" go? Back to the Smurfs? I thought I was watching ""Independence Day 2"" for a while. You must watch the ""Easter Eggs"" between the 10 minute credits. Mind-numbing and stupid but great for adolescent boys who like ""manly"" women, ""WWE"" and all that stuff. Very redundant to the first Thor. Verdict: Thor 2 made my head sore!",Thor - The Dark World
106,shakercoola,The hammer fell to sometimes pounding boredom,5,23 July 2018,"The second instalment of the adventures of Thor is something of a let down comparatively. The first film had some interesting backstory but this time we are weighed down by over-explanation, a convoluted plot, and editing which is too fast for the viewer to enjoy the splendourous CGI worlds artists have gone to so much trouble of imagining. This time the characters are in London and the plot shifts with preposterous coincidence to London too, and then used as a finale for supposedly the end of the universe. Its tongue-in-cheek, to which I will give it credit, but the main problem is the feeling that Thor is not vulnerable enough that he is not going to win the day. It's an overwrought production, engaging only by its pounding music and incessant battle scenes and spacecraft kinetics. It's good fair but when you've seen the 'high striker' a couple of times at the fair you need something new and Thor lacks dimension when he's the lead character expected to carry the whole film without much new backstory extended to him. There is some saviour and that is, once again, Tom Hiddleston in wide-eyed mania who gave us an interesting villain with perfectly pronounced threats with a trace of unsettling sibilance.",Thor - The Dark World

108,Terryfan,Thor The Dark World Pure Entertainment,8,27 April 2015,"It took me a while but I finally got to sit down long enough to watch Thor The Dark World which is a sequel to Thor (2011) and The Avengers where Thor also appears.And this time Thor will face his greatest challenge ever. Thor The Dark World takes a new twist as well as following the story line that took place in the Avengers.The film really took the effects to the extreme and the special effects are like watching the comic book come to life on screen really well time and show amazing talent. Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Natalie Portman, Jaimie Alexander, Anthony Hopkins, Idris Elba, Stellan Skarsgard all reprise their roles from the first movie and that's always good to see when you have the same cast return.But the plot for the film when you watch the film you understand why it was called The Dark World. It's good to see them mix humor with the story and they were clever with how to make the comedy, the drama is strong as well as each of the cast brings their best to the screen and of course the action is very well done as you see some of the most extreme fights in film What makes the film work is we get characters development that follows from The Avengers.The music in the film is superb with it helping telling the story of each scene for the film the action in the film is awesome and very well done plus you see how tough these characters are on their own.Again the Special effects are some of the most stunning I have seen in a film, the performance from the cast is a mix but they still deliver on the characters they bring to life and Marvel Fans will appreciate them for doing it.Thor The Dark World is a film that you have to watch it might not be highs of highs but it is still pure entertainment. With amazing special effects strong performances and a thrill ride you'll have a thundering good time I give Thor The Dark World an 8 out of 10",Thor - The Dark World
109,MR_Heraclius,Thor,7,24 February 2020,"Is this a huge stepup from the original ""Thor"" movie. No, unfortunately not. Is it another watchable, fun superhero movie; yes, definitely. It's a really good movie and if we look at the way Alan Taylor directs this movie, it's actually not that much different from what Branagh did back in 2011. Chris Hemsworth is good as usual and Tom Hiddleston is more wonderful than ever as Loki, but the villain Malekith, played by Christopher Eccleston, unfortunately, is a bit of a disappointment, mostly because of the lack of motivation.",Thor - The Dark World
110,Screen_Blitz,"This movie continues the storyline on our titular hero on a fairly blemished note, but at least it is not a total washout",6,4 November 2017,"This sequel to 2011's 'Thor' exhibits the return of our titular Marvel superhero with both the good and the bad to offer for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With no surprise, expectations were high on how this film would handle the resurrection of the hammer- wielding god of thunder considering how the cinematic universe is set speak to the fanbase rather than Hollywood's general expectations. This only bring us to the question of whether it succeeds. The answers lies square in between yes and no. Kenneth Branaugh who directed the first film dropped out of the project, and the director's chair was handed over to Alan Taylor. The final outcome shows the Branaugh holds a slightly more gifted handling on the source material whereas Taylor's rendition of the titular hero leaves more to desired. By no means does this mark a disaster of a sequel but rather a disappointing one to say the least. It has the sleek visual scope that everyone would expect to come from a big- budget MCU entry, but what it has to offer from a narrative standpoint is fairly underwhelming. Chris Hemsworth returns as Thor, the god of thunder who returns to Earth to find his lover Jane Foster (played by Natalie Portman) cursed by a mysterious force known as Aether, a sinister weapon helmed from a dark realm. And the evil leader Malekith (played by Christopher Eccleston) is behind all this. When Thor brings Jane to Asgard to learn what's happening to her, his father Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins) lacks interest is helping. This leaves Thor with no one to turn to but his dubious brother Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston) in a fight against Malekith and his army of Dark Elves in an effort to free Jane of this sinister curse. Watching Thor battle against the evil demonic forces, thrashing his lightning-charge hammer in an ass-kicking frenzy should be a whole lot of fun. For awhile, it has its moments of excitement, but it is not too long before the excitement steadily starts to drain out beneath the underwhelming storyline. The film does what its predecessor did best, and that is setting up the story with an intriguing premise involving a mythological war raging between Asgard and the evil forces that threaten the mythical realm. Once the the plot kicks into gear, it settles with something less interesting than what is promised. The first half moves along a series of frenetic, visually-arousing action sequences intertwined with overlong exposition used to establish our new main villain Malekith, who is played cleanly by Christopher Eccleston, but nonetheless fails to grow as an interesting figure. Whereas Tom Hiddleston's Loki flourished with charisma that made him a compelling villain, Malekith lacks depth and feels awfully generic which only renders it final climatic sequence less effective; though not without plenty of sweet special effects to go around. As for Chris Hemsworth, he remains charismatic ever as ever in the title role as does Tom Hiddleston as his brother Loki who's alignment on both the good side and the bad side stands ambiguous. Meanwhile, Natalie Portman is restrained in the damsel-in-distress role that operates more as a plot device than a solid character. Many will be wishing she and Hemsworth demonstrated a much stronger chemistry.Thor: Dark World marks a fairly inferior chapter to the now- franchise, and ends on a rather disappointing note. However, it is not to say that Alan Taylor doesn't offer the goods in terms of special effects action elan to occupy those who are able to skim past the patchy flaws in its script. Compared to other entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this makes for a lesser option, but maybe one worth at least a try for better or worse. After all, the movie is not a total washout",Thor - The Dark World
111,Troy_Campbell,"Fun, witty and exhilarating.",8,1 November 2013,"Thor was a big gamble for Marvel in 2011. One of the campier Avengers who was surrounded by full-blown fantasy elements, the Norse God with a big red cape and hammer wasn't even being played by a well known star. What a difference two years and a box office behemoth in the form of The Avengers makes. This sequel comes with virtually no risk and a lead actor who is now a bona fide A-lister, but it also comes with much higher hopes. Swapping Kenneth Branagh's Shakespearian influence for Alan Taylor's Game of Thrones experience, The Dark World has decreased it's regality and amped up it's grittiness, yet thankfully retains its sense of fun. There's definitely a feel of greater peril here, with no-one but Thor seemingly out of Taylor's reach for a fatal ending, however for every scene of despair or Dark Elven malevolence, there's a hilarious gag (Loki's shapeshifting and any time Stellan Skarsgard's nutty scientist is on screen are highlights) waiting around the corner. The action set-pieces don't disappoint either; the climactic battle is inventive, if not mind-blowing, and a couple of earlier melees - including an attack on Asgard - are exhilarating and keep the pace moving swiftly along. What elevates this follow up though is the pairing of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who, after two previous movies to build up their brotherly baggage and perfect their repartee, are scintillating whether in the process of a daring escape or just engaging in some general chit chat. Fulfils its blockbuster quota of action spectacle whilst adding a healthy dose of spot-on humour and sharply written dialogue - what's not to like?",Thor - The Dark World
112,RNMorton,Elements of brilliance,8,10 November 2013,"I really liked the Thor comics in the 60's. They had the same limitation of this movie, in that they were somewhat bound one way or another to Asgard (which could be a good thing in a small dose). This movie is not too long, it moves along very well, has a lot of action, is well cast (a strength with all Marvel movies), I think my only major criticism is that it often moves so fast that I never get to either enjoy the moment, or figure out where we are going. Natale Portman is beautiful if looking somewhat anorexic (not the best look for her), Kat Denning works well in occasional comic relief, Hopkins is great as Odin, more of Elba as Heimdall was also welcome. I really really like Huddleston, he is so spot on as Loki it's scary, his deceptive character plays so well against the straight-laced Thor. Looking forward to the next one.",Thor - The Dark World

It's definitely rough on the edges and you can tell they were still trying to figure out which direction they wanted to take for Thor and the universe he lives in.

115,brchthethird,A lesser entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,7,14 November 2014,"While it still mostly on par with the first THOR, this sequel feels bigger while also losing a lot of the human connection which made the previous one enjoyable. There are some fleeting moments of humor, but there's also a lot of gloom and doom. In THOR: THE DARK WORLD, Thor has to save the universe (Avengers anyone?) from Malekith and the Aether. Sure, there's some half-baked scientific explanation for all of it but the end result is a little disappointing. Malekith was a cool-looking villain, but not very engaging or charismatic. There were also a few too many narrative conveniences, a couple involving Loki's ability to impersonate other people. Nevertheless, it was entertaining and kind of what I've come to expect from Marvel. The acting is very good, as is the action and visual effects. I still don't buy Natalie Portman as a scientist, but oh well. This isn't Marvel's best, but Phase 2 is going pretty good so far. If you've liked Marvel's previous entries, you should like this one too.",Thor - The Dark World

118,educallejero,The worst villain(s). I hate every second with the humans. But I love all of Asgard's.,5,12 April 2019,"What can I say? This is not a very good movie for the simple fact that every second we get with the villains or the humans, the movie feels like a Transformers sequel. All the human and villains parts are exactly like Michael Bay's franchise, fill of: pathetic attempts of (very, very) low brow humor, terrible exposition, bad acting.The difference here is that we have another big junk of the movie that involves Thor, Loki and the Asgardians, and it's very good, probably more because of the actors (Hemsworth and Hiddleston are both amazing at what they do) than anything the movie does. Also, like in the first one, all the family drama and storyline is pretty good, and I liked the 3rd act, for the most part.So in the end, the movie is broken. They continued the totally unnecessary connection with the humans by forcing the storyline and they maintained the worst part of the 1st movie, and they sadly wasted an opportunity to make a really good Thor movie, which would end on Kevin's Feige decision to just parody and laugh at Thor in the sequel and last of the trilogy.",Thor - The Dark World
119,phubbs,Thor: The Dark World,4,10 February 2014,"Solid title, lets hope it really is dark...yeah right. Its only been two years and we have another Thor adventure. The first film wasn't too bad considering the source material is a tough cookie to film, so I went into this sequel with a relatively positive outlook. So far Marvel has done us proud so why worry.Oh dear, now I would mention the plot outline briefly, as normal, but put simply...I can't. The reason being I genuinely don't really understand what I just saw. I haven't been this confused in a film since I don't know. The bad guys in this film are called Dark Elves which sounds pretty sweet admittedly...and kinda 'Warhammer-ish'. They all look quite cool with their creepy gaunt expression-less masks on and their leader Malekith also looks really good and evil...and kinda 'Hellboy 2-ish'. You could also say they all feel a tad like Stormtroopers especially with all the lasers being fired everywhere, was that laser fire? looked like it.The Star Wars similarities became even worse when the elves started attacking Asgard in rather familiar looking spacecraft. Asgard itself also looking suspiciously like the capital city of Naboo, Theed. So even though these Dark Elves look quite cool they simply end up as masses of faceless hammer fodder for Thor and his buddies. There is also an uber Dark Elf monster thing that Malekith created with some of the Aether? again visually great with a nice body suit but why didn't Malekith just do this with all his elves or as many as possible? Oh and one minute he's with Malekith after being changed/infected, and the next scene he's captured and in Asgard?! wut?!The script is a complete mess, the film jumps around just like the characters do in the final half of the film. What exactly do the Dark Elves want?? they just wanna errr...destroy the universe? shroud it in darkness?...why exactly? At the start when Portman is sucked into another dimension or something I had no clue what was going on or why she was sucked in. Then there's this Aether stuff...what the hell is that suppose to be? is it a living being? what's its purpose? where does it come from? did anyone make it?. Damn unlucky how Portman's character got zapped straight to where this lethal universe destroying stuff was though huh, wow what are the odds!The action is generic and boring throughout, sorry but it is. The escape from Asgard is typically absurd as Thor manages to pilot a craft he's never stepped foot in before. OK that aspect is joked on by Loki but he still manages to pilot it skillfully evading lots of laser fire and treacherous tight spaces. None of the elves pose any threat to Thor or his mates whatsoever, including a big stone creature. This could quite easily be a lightweight 'Lord of the Rings' spin off frankly, replace elves with orcs, they're both useless against good guys. Most of the fights are pointless as Thor's mates are all invincible yet at the same time Asgardian soldiers seem to be just as useless as the bad guys.You can tell things weren't going as well as hoped because they have stuck Loki back into the fray to try and boost the film. Easily the best character for sure but Jesus Christ you can't rely on this guy every time, I'm amazed the characters are still dumb enough to even trust him sheesh! They actually closed the book with Loki really well in this film but nooooo...couldn't leave it at that, had to have that last twist to spoil it. Continuity wise the film is great no doubt, everyone is back and the story follows on well from the first film. I hope this is the last we see of Portman though as I simply cannot stand her, she has a small range of facial expressions and she uses them over and over. Plus she looked really bored here. Bad guy Eccleston (Hollywood loves a Brit bad guy don't they) had nothing to do and very little to say, great makeup but wasted badly.Sure the film looks delicious with lovely CGI but did you expect it not to? Well I say that but everything falls apart in the London finale, yep the end of the world happens in...Greenwich. The last long long action sequence is the biggest flapping muddle ever, there are characters jumping and falling through portals like no ones business. Weapons and debris flying all over the place and popping up here there and everywhere, the elves look like tacky extras from Doctor Who as they run around the London streets, its all ridiculous.The entire plot is utterly preposterous, it makes no sense half the time and the other half is virtually unexplained. It all hinges on this Aether stuff and the alignment of the nine worlds...aaaand as I type this I'm boring myself. This whole film just feels like filler until the next Avengers outing, nothing more. The action is tepid and bland, half the characters didn't even need to be here as they have little screen time, the Earth based human characters were annoying, the plot is something else and the end of credits scene with Del Toro looked absolutely awful!! Sorely disappointed with this generic effort.4/10",Thor - The Dark World

121,natashabowiepinky,Thor I bow to ye,7,23 August 2014,"He may look like the washed up star of an 80's rock group, but Thor is definitely a Superhero. Look at him... swinging his hammer around, flying through the sky, saving countless lives in the Nine Realms he protects... What a guy. His brother Loki might be a bad sort (he's already tried to destroy the world twice) but good ol' Thor will always be there to save the day. And we need him now more than ever... Because some Dark Elf is going to blow up our planet with the aid of The Biggest TV Transmitter Ever.Sadly it pains me to reveal our long-haired demi-god has problems of his own. Ya see, the love of his life, the apple of his eye, (a human FYI, our friend Thor doesn't know the meaning of the word discrimination) has been infected with a rare life-form which will KILL her. For a crisis this big, What will Thor do? What's that you say? Team up with his despised brother on a suicide mission to save the girl and the Earth? I never would have thought...So, yeah. This is exciting. It's thrilling. It also has a naked dude roaming around Stonehenge, but seeing as everything is pixellated, let's not hold that against it too much. The highlight is Loki and Thor's enforced partnership, though it doesn't last very long. Seeing these complete opposites who don't trust each other one inch attempting to fight their enemies and each other simultaneously is great fun. Can you say 'The Odd Couple'? It's got all the popcorn crackling entertainment you'd expect from a Marvel production. Roll on the next one. Until then, I'll have to make do with my handcrafted puppets... 7/10",Thor - The Dark World
122,Anurag-Shetty,The best Marvel movie after The Avengers & the best superhero movie of the year!,10,13 November 2013,"Thor: The Dark World continues with the story of the God of Thunder, Thor(Chris Hemsworth). After Loki(Tom Hiddleston), is imprisoned for his despicable crimes in New York(these events take place in The Avengers) by Odin(Anthony Hopkins), Thor along with Sif(Jaimie Alexander), Fandral(Zachary Levi), Volstagg(Ray Stevenson) & Hogun(Tadanobu Asano) set about the task of bringing peace & harmony to the nine realms. However, when an ancient & extremely dangerous substance called the Aether gets unleashed into the universe it is up to Thor, to stop the Dark Elves led by Malekith(Christopher Eccleston) from laying their hands on the Aether. However, Thor can't do this on his own. So, he seeks the help of his estranged brother, Loki. Thor also returns to Midgard aka Earth to protect his love interest, Jane Foster(Natalie Portman) at any cost. I freaking loved this film! It was definitely the best superhero movie of the year. It was even better than Superman reboot, Man of Steel because even though it was action packed, there were humorous scenes as well. The 3D was effective except, in the scenes with dialogs. The special effects were out of this world. I loved the fact that there was more Asgard, this time. I also liked that they introduced us to more worlds like, Anaheim & Svartalfheim. The climax was so unexpected & mind blowing. This is the only Marvel film, to have such an unforeseen twist. This film was way better than Thor(2011). It was way more action packed & hilarious compared to Kenneth Branagh's watered down original. The performances was definitely one, of the many pros of the film. Chris Hemsworth plays the part of Thor, to perfection. Natalie Portman is brilliant as Jane Foster. However the standout performer in the film is, yet again, Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Hiddleston's cheeky & witty dialog delivery keeps the viewers guffawing for a good part of the film. However, Loki can turn terrifying in an instant. This shows what a versatile actor Tom Hiddleston is. No matter how despicable Loki is, I can pretty much guarantee that everyone loves Loki. This is the magic of Hiddleston. Anthony Hopkins is great as Odin. Christopher Eccleston is menacingly evil as Malekith. Jaimie Alexander, Zachary Levi, Ray Stevenson & Tadanobu Asano are impressive as Sif, Fandral, Volstagg & Hogun respectively. Idris Elba is spectacular as Heimdall. Rene Russo is outstanding as Frigga. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is effective as Algrim/Kurse. Kat Dennings & Stellan Skarsgard are great as Darcy Lewis & Erik Selvig respectively. If I had to pick one teeny tiny flaw then that would be that, the film was too short. I would have loved an extra ten to fifteen minutes. Anyway, Thor: The Dark World is a must watch for pretty much everyone, even the Marvel haters.",Thor - The Dark World
123,fernandoschiavi,"The Dark World finally marks the establishment of Thor as a true hero, facing an imminent threat in a darker context, without leaving aside the humor",8,2 March 2020,"While Iron Man 3 started the second phase of Marvel, with Tony having to deal with the consequences of the New York battle here on Earth and still having to face the scientist Aldrich Killian and the Extremis technology, it is time to see the god of Thunder having to deal with events after the first meeting of the Avengers. In this sequence, without having to worry about introducing the main characters, director Alan Taylor has the chance to go deeper and explore several aspects. The script continues to explore the relationship between the brothers Thor and Loki, since when Thor hands over Loki to become a prisoner in Asgard and especially when Thor is forced to convince Loki to ally himself to avenge his mother and save the universe from the threat of Malekith. The provocations, the anger, the rivalry, the lack of confidence and the action carried out by the brothers moves the film in several crucial moments.Other characters have more space, specifically in the core of London, such as Darcy (Kat Dennings) and Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård). Another one with greater prominence is Frigga (Rene Russo), wife of Odin and mother of Thor, with a much bigger participation and with extreme importance for the unfolding of the plot, we even see its potential using a sword. Even Odin (Anthony Hopkins) also plays a major role. Natalie Portman has a fundamental role in the plot. The actress manages to do well in humorous scenes and finally reunites with Thor, whom she had been waiting for two years. Jane Foster has the chance to go to Asgard, meet the beloved's parents and be the key to a great threat to the universe. Chris Hemsworth, even more at ease in the character, concludes Thor's maturation, from inconsequential to hero (it is noted in the lines of his final scene). Meanwhile, Tom Hiddleston is flawless again in Loki's shoes.Even more at ease, sarcastic, unpredictable and probably the biggest highlight of the feature, taking a little of the highlight including the antagonist Malekith, played by Christopher Eccleston, just correct in the character. Once again the Asgardian warriors were misused, especially Sif (Jaimie Alexander). A mention was even made of the love triangle between her, Jane and Thor, but this sub-plot was simply left out.Other characters have more space, specifically in the core of London, such as Darcy (Kat Dennings) and Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård). Another one with greater prominence is Frigga (Rene Russo), wife of Odin and mother of Thor, with a much bigger participation and with extreme importance for the unfolding of the plot, we even see its potential using a sword. Even Odin (Anthony Hopkins) also plays a major role. Natalie Portman has a fundamental role in the plot.Well-designed action scenes. All the scenes that show the convergence between the galaxies through portals are well elaborated, in addition to great action scenes, such as the invasion of the Black Elves in their spaceships in Asgard that originated great sequences with the escape of Thor, Loki, Jane and his allies, thus disobeying Odin's express order. We also have the action sequences in the Dark World and even the final scenes in London (Greenwich) when the alignment of the universes was about to occur.On the technical side, production designer Charles Wood and photographer Kramer Morgenthau also did a great job, especially in rebuilding Asgard. Previously shown as a technological society, with a clean and futuristic design, but very artificial, being built almost entirely in computer graphics, it has modifications, especially in scenes with more closed plans. With a bigger budget in hand, the team can portray Asgard being a little more realistic, more medieval and more ""dirty"" in his look, giving the kingdom a more realistic look, giving the impression that people really live there. Even due to the threat presented, other kingdoms can be seen, unlike the first film. In addition to Asgard and Midgard (Earth), we see the dark world of Svartalfheim, the original home of the Black Elves, Vanaheim (home of the Hogun family, lived by Tadanobu Asano), and yet Jotunheim (home of the first giant ice giants) and others from the Nine Realms.Thor: The Dark World finally marks the establishment of Thor as a true hero, facing an imminent threat in a darker context, within the most magical and fantastical universe of the character, without leaving aside the humor, a hallmark of Marvel's productions . And there is an important post-credit scene for future Marvel films, with a character present in the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" universe, which promises to be one of the most electrifying films to come.",Thor - The Dark World

It keeps most of the characters from the first film, well described and played, which contribute decisively to the outcome of the movie.It proved to be a very good movie, an excellent watch and clearly an improvement in almost every aspect. It had a couple of superficial moments, or events which could have been more carefully treated, but it still is a very good movie!",Thor - The Dark World
127,swilliky,Simple sequel with not much to add to the MCU,6,5 November 2017,"Thor (Chris Hemsworth) returns in phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe for a solo adventure that helps tie up some of the aftermath of The Avengers. Odin (Anthony Hopkins) Narrates an old tale of the dark elves and their powerful magical object known as the Aether. The leader of the dark elves Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) only manages to save a few dark elves including Algrim (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) before the rest are destroyed by the Asgardians. In the present day, Thor works to return peace to the nine realms after his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) brought chaos from his actions in The Avengers. Loki is punished and only spared death because of the mercy of his and Thor's mother Frigga (Rene Russo). Thor and his friends win a battle after Thor takes down a giant rock monster with one swing. He celebrates but his mind is tugged back to Earth even as Sif (Jaimie Alexander) makes advances towards him.In London, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) goes on an awkward date with Richard (Chris O'Dowd) when Darcy (Kat Dennings) shows up to show her a strange signal on her device. Jane, Darcy, and the new intern Ian (Jonathan Howard) head to the location of the signal. Meanwhile, Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) has gone crazy around the Stonehenge landing him in a mental ward. Jane explores the area and is transported to the dark world and infected by the Aether. Heimdall (Idris Elba) notices that Jane has gone missing and sends Thor to find her. Jane returns thinking she's only been gone for a short time but has really been gone for five hours so Darcy had called the police. Jane is a bit upset to see Thor since he didn't visit her when he came to New York. First, Darcy then the police interrupt their talk. The police try to arrest Jane but it causes a huge explosion. Sensing something wrong, Thor brings Jane back to Asgard where they can discover more. Odin is not happy about Jane's presence her but he explains that the Aether is a fluid infinity stone.

128,bryank-04844,"I'm not sure who really is to blame for this sequel's dragging pace and missed opportunities, but with an excellent third act, all is pretty much forgiven.",7,22 August 2015,"And we're back with the first non-Iron-Man sequel in the Marvel universe with 'Thor: The Dark World', with the entire cast back ready for more saving the universe and defeating evil. However, this time around, the sequel felt uneasy and a little bit off, as it dragged in the mid-section quite a bit, or when Tom Hiddleston's Loki (Thor's adopted brother) is not on screen. Sure, the main event is Thor himself (Chris Hemsworth), but he seems to take a back seat for most of the film, as the co-stars really drive this movie as Thor smashes his hammer from foe to foe.This sequel is set to make a killing at the box office, and I'm sure it will opening weekend, but I imagine word of mouth after that will drive sales down. That's not to say that this is a poorly made movie, or even that it's not an enjoyable film. On the contrary, it's a very enjoyable film, it just dragged a bit, and I'm sure that's why Marvel filmed some extra scenes with Loki, which were sorely needed this time around. And director Alan Taylor does his best with the big steaming head of Marvel looking over his shoulder constantly. I'm not sure who really is to blame for this sequel's dragging pace and missed opportunities, but with an excellent third act, all is pretty much forgiven.As we see in the opening scene, which is a very early epilogue, is a battle with creatures known as the Dark Elves, who look very creepy on a planet called Alfheim, who were actually existing before the beginning of time. Their big weapon against everyone and everything is called Aether, which is a black and red gas like substance that can destroy all. However, the Dark Elves are seemingly all killed by Thor's grandfather, but a few manage to escape.Cut to present day, which is literally right after the 'Avengers' film as we see Loki in handcuffs awaiting his sentencing for destroying New York by King dad Odin (Anthony Hopkins). He is sentenced to the rest of his life in the Asgard dungeon with all of the other criminals from the other worlds or realms, which his cell resembles something similar in X-Men or any other futuristic movie, with white walls, and fancy furniture, and a glass like window instead of metal bars, where he has genuine conversations with his mother Frigga (Rene Russo) about their relationship and love, and who finally gets a bit more action and character this time around than the first film.Since the Bifrost bridge that connects Earth and Asgard was destroyed in the first film, Thor and his love interest Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), have not seen each other, as Thor and his small army of friends are keeping the peace on other realms. But Thor checks in from time to time with the gate keeper Heimdall (Idris Elba) who can see that she is doing alright, and even on a date with Richard (a under-used Chris O'Dowd). But when her intern Darcy (Kat Dennings) interrupts her date with news of some space anomaly that is similar to the first time Thor appeared, Jane is sucked into a different realm and the Aether enters her body, giving her some powers.As this happens, the remaining Dark Elves are awakened and led by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) to retrieve the Aether and destroy the universe. With the cutting between the Dark Elves plotting war and the Asgardians and Earth, all becomes a bit jumbled and messy. As Thor takes Jane to Asgard to seek help and meet the family, it's clear that the Dark Elves mean business and the only one who can seem to help out is Loki, to which against better judgement is freed from prison and asked to help defeat the bad guys.It's only here with Loki, when the film sparks new life, that is until the final battle in Greenwich, London, where buildings are destroyed, and Earth, Asgard, and The Dark Elves square off. With the great character of Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and Loki delivering great one-liners, the sequel finally finds its footing, and becomes the movie it needs to be.Director Allen Taylor has directed some of the best episodes of the best television shows of recent memory including 'The Sopranos', 'Mad Men', and 'Game of Thrones'. He seems to do a good job here without the advantage of having several hours worth of plot development, but again, Marvel is known for clashing heads with the creative types. And editors Dan Lebental and Wyatt Smith deserve some mention here, especially in the final 15 minutes of the film, as the battle travels between realms quite often, and the timing with this is flawless. And Brian Tyler's score is excellent, as it always adds some great suspense and emotion into every scene. I definitely need this soundtrack.And be sure, as always, to stay till the very end after credits roll. As there are not one, but TWO extra scenes that might make you scream and laugh.",Thor - The Dark World

But I was not thrown out of my seat. The mixture of Earth life and other worlds does not compute with me. How can you show all the minorities living in Greenwich in the film like this? Our world is so imperfect that I do not like mixing make believe super worlds like Asgard with this miserable one of ours.I really liked the mask of the main villain, what was his name?

130,Seth_Rogue_One,Style Over Substance: The Movie,4,3 January 2016,"Oh was that not the name of the movie? Could have fooled me that's for sure.When people talk about this movie they often talk about how great it looks, well the budget is 170 000 000 dollars so OF COURSE it looks good.It would take the biggest idiot on earth not to be able to make it look good with that big of a budget, just hire a great director of photography, set director and CGI artists and everything will fall into place... Visually.To get it right story-wise and acting-wise of course requires a little more finesse which in reality is not the movies strong parts if we're being realistic here.The plot is messy and throw random sci fi logic (with very little actual logic) and events around like they are sprinkling an ice cream and not really seeing the full picture of what story they are trying to convey, random transportation ports and monsters for instance is very convenient to say the least.And the acting, oh no, Nathalie Portman who I usually like a lot does the definition of a phoned in performance clearly just doing the movie for the money and the rest of the cast is not that much better.But who cares about plot and acting in a Marvel movie right? Clearly not that many considering the high rating (of currently 7.1).If people asked for more than just a stylish movie and didn't sucker in just because a movie looks good and has cool action scenes then perhaps we would have gotten a little more substance to it, but clearly that is not a lot of people's priorities which is unfortunate.",Thor - The Dark World
131,jdkraus,"Not as Character driven, but it makes up with better action sequences",7,15 December 2013,"""Thor: The Dark World"" does not so much pick up on the events following its predecessor for it tells its own separate story. The focus is on another old enemy of Asgaard, the Dark Elves who possess a long since lost artifact called the Eather—which grants virtually indestructible power to a living host. While Thor brings peace and attempts to unite the 9 worlds of the universe, the Dark Elves arise and plan to blanket everything in darkness. Breaking away from a simple rehashing of the first film's plot is refreshing and advantageous, for it introduces a new perspective of this universe that non-Marvel Comic savvy persons like myself are unfamiliar with. At the same time, the movie retains all the characters and their personalities from the previous flick—Thor, Jane Foster, Dr. Selvig, Odin, Frigga, Heimdall, and even the science intern Darcy and Loki.New faces are added too. Jonathan Howard plays the intern's intern Ian. And Chris Eccleston plays Malekith—the leader of the Dark Elves. Both are effective in their roles, however, their purpose to the overall story is rather vague. Ian is pretty much a sidekick of sorts, but he doesn't really achieve much as a character, other than flipping a car on some dark elves and making out with one of the girls. The motives for the Malekith character are left unanswered. So he is a villain who wants to rule the universe. Okay. Why? Revenge? Insanity? There is no explanation. The only conclusion I can come up with is from him floating around in space hibernation for 5,000 years. I guess the solitude finally got to him. More meaningless actions brought questions to my mind during the film's progression, such as why the Asgaardian soldiers brought spears and shields to a laser rifle fight or how F-18s suddenly appear to try and destroy the enemy spaceship on earth. I'm probably taking this film too seriously when a movie such as this is anything but that. Nevertheless, some plausibility has to be present in order to suspend the viewer's disbelief. Unfortunately, this movie fails a bit here. More amusing is how the movie tries to be technical and intelligent about the sciences behind the Eather, the space portals, and the ""convergence"" between the different planets. Science fiction is fun but it needs limitations for the viewers' sake. What does make ""Thor 2"" memorable though is the action sequences. They are abundant, long, gigantic in scale, and over the top entertaining. The Dark Elves onslaught against Asgaard is particularly fascinating to watch on the big screen. I enjoyed myself despite its ridiculousness and I can never resist the charms of the cast, especially Stellen Skaarsgard as the crazier than average Dr. Selvig, Kat Dennings as the quirky Darcy, Natalie Portman as the adorable Jane Foster, and Tom Hiddleston as the deceptive Loki. I also liked that Stan Lee and Chris Evans deliver minor comedic cameos. Characters and action is what this kind of movie needs and ""Thor 2"" has both. Too bad it is not nearly as character driven as the original Thor, but the ending makes up a little with a good twist. So pay close attention.",Thor - The Dark World
132,Prichards12345,Really Enjoyable,8,2 November 2013,"Marvel continue to show they understand their characters (and their audience) better than anyone else with Thor:The Dark World. I'm trying to write a virtually spoiler-free review so I won't go into the plot, other than to say it chuggs along nicely, and the second half of the movie is laced with humour. All the cast from the first movie return and the new villain is Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) a dark-elf on a mission to restore what he sees is the natural order of the universe. And everyone is given a moment or too to do their thing, from Hopkins' gravitas to Stellen Starsgard's bonkers scientist, the film does not disappoint.Forget the scientific gobbledegook explanations that explain the plot - just have fun with this rollicking fantasy adventure, that even goes a bit Star Warsy at times. Natalie Portman must have smiled at being asked to do a lakeside scene not dissimilar from what we saw in Attack Of The Clones. I certainly did.As ever Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston are at the heart of what makes this movie tick - Hiddlestone again is terrific, easily one of the best Superhero movie villains. Hemsworth again does well as Thor.The numerous effects are splendid but unlike Man Of Steel, not overbearing, and the film itself has a pretty epic feel at times. Alan Taylor's direction is very assured. The constant world-hopping may jar the uninitiated but the film is very enjoyable, and is mercifully 120 minutes or so long; and in an era when Hollywood excess often gives you a bum-numbing 150+ minute movies, that's surely no bad thing. Excellent. Can't wait for Captain America: The Winter Solidier.",Thor - The Dark World

Thor: The Dark World was the only sequel in the phase 2 section that was underdeveloped. The storyline felt like another retelling of the first film and it's a shame. This film had potential, but is the first film that has no villain creation, now a common Marvel problem. It has a feeling of no clear filmmaker tone, there's rumoured production battles behind the scenes. Flawed but not horrible. This was the weakest phase 2 film.",Thor - The Dark World
134,DarthVoorhees,Completely on autopilot...,2,8 December 2013,"Let me start by saying that I don't hate superhero films. I like them very much when they are done well. I hate laziness in films and superficiality. The problem is that pretty much every superhero film made is very lazy and most of them are entirely superficial. Marvel's initial idea of an Avengers universe was inspired from a marketing stand point but I am beginning to question whether or not it has been a failure from a creative stand point. 'Thor the Dark World' is a terrible movie. It does absolutely nothing to add to the mythos of the character or this Marvel universe. The only reason it exists is to draw up excitement for the next Avengers film. There are no stakes to this film and there are a lot of places to direct blame. The acting aside from Tom Hiddleston is next to unwatchable. The thing is that this is a very talented cast we are working with here. Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman have both won Academy Awards. Stellan Skarsgard is one of the most fascinating character actors in Hollywood. I like Hemsworth a lot too and thought he was great in the first 'Thor' film. But none of them invest anything in the material. Hopkins looks bored and emotes nothing in his delivery. Portman's performance is terrible too and in the process of it being terrible it makes a terrible script look even worse. Jane Foster is a horrible character here. She is by far the stupidest damsel in distress portrayed in comic books recently. Portman is too lazy to give her any sort of character. She punctuates every cheap joke and many of them are just about how ditsy the character is. This kind of writing and performance make me almost agree that comic books offer a flawed and stereotypical depiction of women. Stellan Skarsgard, an actor I think has great depth, is played as a complete fool here. I hated every time he appeared on screen and I am a Stellan Skarsgard fan. I don't place the blame all on him but yeah everyone here did something very wrong in bringing these stupidly conceived characters to life.In actuality though they are not the biggest problem with the film. The problem is that there is no threat to anything or anyone. The villain here is so completely forgettable and has a plan for evil so half assed that they movie really had no chance of working. This is the ultimate example of a conflict for the sake of having a conflict. If actor Christopher Eccleston is not rewarded a Razzie for his portrayal here than that award show has lost all credibility. Villains even poorly written ones with no motivation like this Maleketh should at least offer the actor the chance to try to ham it up with the tropes of goofy villainy. Eccleston doesn't do that. He has a boring calm delivery that evokes no response but laughter. And since Eccleston's performance is such an overwhelming failure I was drawn to how stupid his make-up looked too. I wish I could give this a bomb rating, I really do. To be honest though Tom Hiddleston is too damn good in the Loki role to say the film is completely without merit. They don't do anything new with his character here but he's so entertaining and in every Marvel film he adds new layers and nuances to a very interesting character. A whole movie could have been made about this stage of Loki's life and it would have been so much more entertaining and compelling than this load of work. Hiddleston portrays Loki as unchained with no loyalty to anyone. This is the first film where we see him as a trickster and Hiddleston delivers suffice to say. The problem is he isn't really in the film long enough. Jane Foster, Darcy, and Dr Selvig all get more screen time than Loki. Here's my brilliant business proposition to Marvel. Don't make any movies but Avengers films. Give your golden boy Joss Whedon the four hundred or so million you spent on 'Iron Man 3' and 'Thor the Dark World' and see what he does with it. In watching 'Iron Man 3' and this film it is clear that is where the mindset and passion are. I hope the Marvel cinematic universe can be saved but I have to say that their track record is looking really bad right now. Kevin Feige and Disney should look back at Favareu's first 'Iron Man' film. It was gutsy and took risks and there was no guarantee of immediate endless sequels.",Thor - The Dark World
135,tomimt,"Flawed , yet reasonably fun",6,12 July 2015,"In theory Thor: The Dark World is a great movie. In this theory it's a great sci-fi epic about beings that look like viking gods. In practice though it is not a great movie as much as it is a deeply flawed movie with some very nice individual scenes in it.The biggest problem T:tDW has is, that it is a Marvel movie and just like very other Marvel movie it does its best to make the viewers remember that they are in fact watching a Marvel movie. This leads into nudges and winks towards the other movies in Marvel's arsenal, which in this case make the movie feel a bit disjointed as it assumes that the viewer has already seen those. It also means that the characters don't really get that much flesh in their stories as the writing clearly seems to assume that someone else is going to flesh out the characters more in somewhere else. That's why the movie is filled with familiar faces whom a casual viewers might have very hard time identifying with, as they have no inkling who those many faces are and what is their significance.TtDW is a fun movie none the less. It is more or less forgettable sequel to a relatively forgettable movie in the first place, but just like the first movie it is reasonably well done to fill its purpose of entertainment. Sadly though it could have been so much more, but in the end that wasn't in the cards.",Thor - The Dark World
136,Likes_Ninjas90,"It's time that comic book fans started to demand more from these films before the entire genre evaporates into a disposable, commercialised heap like it does here",4,30 October 2013,"Thor: The Dark World left me wondering why for all its popularity and box office hype the superhero genre so regularly fails to ignite the faintest trace of excitement and imagination in its narrative and storytelling. This sequel, following Kenneth Branagh's reasonably funny 2011 film, was written by no less than five writers, who between them have only mustered another dull, achingly generic story about saving the world. Aside from less than a handful of funny self-referencing points, this is a hugely disappointing by the numbers blockbuster that under services its embarrassingly rich cast and offers its enormous fanbase too little that is challenging, inspired or even surprising. What's confusing about the deliberate complacency in the script is that it's entirely unnecessary. There is no financial risk to comic book adaptations anymore to justify this kind of dumbing down. Earlier this year, Iron Man 3 became one of the top five highest grossing films of all time. While Christopher Nolan's Batman films have achieved financial success without succumbing to simplified narrative lines. Some even complained The Dark Knight Rises had too many story threads. How many filmmakers today would crawl over broken glass for a cast featuring Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins, Idris Elba, Tom Hiddleston, Chris O'Dowd and Stellan Skarsgard? With such talent it's not unreasonable then to ask for more than obligatory special effects and indistinguishable villains, who are included only to prop up pseudo- scientific plot points. Little effort has been exhausted into humanising these characters. Thor (Hemsworth) is a blank slate who swings his hammer and growls at people. It makes Chris Hemsworth look like a boring actor when we've seen how charismatic he can be, like he was in Rush, with the right material and director. There are fewer fish out of water jokes that I enjoyed in the first film. Natalie Portman, normally a delightful, charming actress, is embarrassed here as Thor's girlfriend, playing a character devoid of plausible emotional responses and desires. Her first reaction after being warped from London to Asgard is to say ""Hi!"" and ""Let's do that again!"" Never mind that her skin is now infected with the Aether, a weapon of mass destruction from an ancient group called the Dark Elves (who speak perfect English no less). She's more impressed that Thor told his dad about her! The Dark Elves are led by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), who wants to use the Aether to destroy the world. Comic book films rise and fall on the quality of their villains. The Dark World has two, both of whom are substandard. The Dark Elves, branding swords and laser weapons, aren't very interesting. Though Thor's brother Loki (Hiddleston) sometimes brings comic relief to the film's dry, seriousness (I did enjoy one clever shape shifting moment) he still doesn't possess the physicality of Tom Hardy's Bane to be a truly menacing physical threat. Locked up in a cell for nearly half the film, there's not a lot for Loki to do. What should also be a haunting surprise at the end of the film is badly telegraphed. When Thor and Loki inevitably team up, the brothers take a few more punches than you might expect, but still recover very quickly, even after a severed hand. Marvel is a subsidiary company belonging to Disney so this is largely bloodless action. This is the first comic book feature film by Alan Taylor, who replaced Patty Jenkins under controversial circumstances. Taylor has worked on television shows like Game of Thrones, and he brings little distinction to the action and the way the story is told. The camera isn't particularly mobile and significant plot lines like the Aether are lazily signposted through the film's prologue. He opts to intercut Thor's main story with a subplot involving Jane's scientist friends back on Earth, including an overly excitable Kat Dennings, who are discovering the alignments of Asgard's nine realms, if that matters. Sometimes they lighten the mood but they're still cornball stereotypes (the wacky sidekick, the crazy scientist and the dorky intern) that don't instill any visible subtext to the plot. The two narrative threads collide with Taylor's most elaborate set piece, as Thor fights simultaneously between universes, a battle that is undone by Thor's own indestructibility. Over the closing credits are shots of the film's concept art, which could be totally interchangeable with most of the plotting. It's time that comic book fans started to demand more from these films before the entire genre evaporates into a disposable, commercialised heap like it does here.",Thor - The Dark World

I'm also not entirely sure that a second movie was required to tell a nonexistent story. If Thor had something to say or even more substance then I could see the benefit in this movie. The whole thing is filled with arrogant one-liners and pointless statements. There are some brilliant action sequences but overall it's lacking in emotion. Even the actors seem a little lacklustre and not fully committed to their roles. It should be better as there is so much talent in this cast but a bad script will always hurt a movie.I know I'm going to cope flack for this but Thor is certainly the worst marvel superhero that has been turned into a movie.

Sure there are a couple of mentions, and a few guest cameos, but there were no logos, not a bad thing actually, I am bringing this up because I think it is a good factor that makes this a better movie. You are not given a movie that is just a walking toy ad like Transformers movies are, or that last The Wolverine﻿ movie(which was good, but the cross-branding was just too much I think). I really Enjoyed this movie even though three stops in the tube would have taken more then the 6 or so minutes that Thor was expected to be keeping Malekith busy. Or the fact that they all have to walk, or run across the Rainbow bridge, which should take a week the thing is so long. However you don't need me to recommend this movie, you will see it, and you will get a great ride out of it, that you can count on.",Thor - The Dark World
141,griffolyon12,"More of the Same, Which is not a Bad Thing",9,8 November 2013,"By this point, you're either a fan of what Marvel Studios are doing with their movies, or you aren't. It is that pure and simple, and if you enjoyed the first Thor film and his role in The Avengers, then you will absolutely love Thor: The Dark World, as I did.Few films these days are as much fun as the films that Marvel Studios are putting out right now. Not only are these films showing deep respect and faithfulness to their source material whenever they can, but they also never try to downplay the fantasticalness of what makes these comic book heroes so awe-inspiring. They embrace the comic booky-nature of all of these heroes and portray it not as satire, because while there are jokes at almost every juncture of these films, the characters are always taking the situations they are in seriously, therefore we're laughing while feeling like there are genuine stakes at hand. Thor: The Dark World does Marvel's typical bang-up job of this, and everything works.This particular film is very much born out of the repercussions of Thor and The Avengers, picking up right where those films left off, and you must have seen both of those films in order to get full enjoyment out of this one. At the start of Thor: The Dark World, Thor is still traveling across the nine realms, trying to restore peace and order to the galaxy after he had to destroy the bifrost at the end of Thor, therefore cutting off the other realms from Asgard's protection. Meanwhile, Loki has been imprisoned in the dungeons of Asgard for his attack on New York at the end of The Avengers. When the convergence of the nine realms approaches, that only happens every one thousand years, an ancient power awakens, threatening to destroy all nine realms, including Midgard, or Earth, as it is better known. This sends Thor having to journey back to Earth to save his beloved mortal, Jane Foster, while also having to make a shaky alliance with Loki in order to fight the evil that is brewing.As a whole, there isn't anything more I can say to entice you to see this film. If you love these films, you're going to see it. All I can really say is that Thor: The Dark World is everything you expect it to be. There is tons of action, lots of laughs (contributed mostly from Kat Dennings' Darcy and some smartly utilized cameos), and the film is also emotional and genuinely heroic. Few films can put you through so much emotional turmoil in the course of the story, and yet still keep things lighthearted and full of hope. That is what Marvel does better than anyone else. What we're seeing here is a new Golden Age for Marvel superheroes, and if you just sit back and allow yourself to enjoy the ride, rather than searching for ways to not like these films just because you have your own ideas of how you feel these heroes should be best represented on film, then you will be a part of something that is truly special.P.S. Stay till the very end of the credits. There are two scenes after the end of the movie. One in the middle of the credits, and one after they're all done.I give Thor: The Dark World a 9 out of 10!",Thor - The Dark World
142,mahmus,Hot take: This is a good movie.,6,13 October 2020,"Its two main problems are a boring villain and pretty much everything that takes place on Earth, including unfortunately the whole third act.However, when it's not on Earth, whether it be Asgard or the dark elf planet (I'm not even gonna look up how to spell it), the film is very damn good, especially when it focuses on Thor and a scene-stealing Loki, who is at his best in this movie.Also, Friga's funeral is absolutely beautiful.Is it the weakest MCU movie? Yeah, It's hard disagree with that. But I think this movie has a lot more going for it that many realise.",Thor - The Dark World
143,Laakbaar,Superhero movie in which universe is saved by wacky humans,7,14 November 2013,"I truly enjoyed this film. The special effects are astonishing, as one expects in movies like this nowadays.But in the end it's just another typical latter-day sensational superhero movie. The elaborate alternative universe (i.e. the dark elves arising once again to use the evil gassy thing to destroy Asgard and the nine worlds) was a little too much for me. I enjoy a good movie, but I've reached the point where I am not that interested in being presented with new universes, in this case ""the Thor universe"". I didn't really care what happened to Asgard.I understand this is an action film oriented towards the video-game generation, and many movie goers want to see action on a grand scale. Moviegoers apparently want demon warriors, medieval empires and frightening alien technology in their movies. Well, I'm getting tired of it.I thought something went wrong with the portrayal of the group of Earth characters on which this franchise is focused. We didn't get to know them well enough. They were portrayed as corollary and wacky and frantic -- and yet they were able to develop this strange and powerful device out of nowhere. They were not true scientists. They were...what exactly? I don't get Jane Weston. Something is wrong with that character and her role in this movie, and perhaps also the way she is portrayed.There was too much action, and not enough plot and character development. There were too many coincidences, too many forced and contrived situations. (The stupid intern throws the car keys into the hole! Jane gets transported right to a small cavern deep underground, which just happens to be the worst place possible! Thor figures out in seconds how to fly an alien aircraft like a pro!) There were too many bone crushing fights and city destroying disasters.I went to this movie (and its predecessor) because...well...I think Chris Hemsworth is eye candy. He duly delivers. This is the perfect role for him. However, I'm ready to see him in a proper movie where he's given a chance to flesh out a character.There are some nice moments in the movie. I can't say I didn't enjoy it. It's better than the Batman movies. It's worth about 7.5 I'd say, but I'm going to round it down for now. I go to these movies, but maybe I shouldn't.",Thor - The Dark World
144,billygoat1071,Better Off Otherworldly,6,30 October 2013,"Thor: The Dark World made a wise choice of stepping up to its sequel. It tends to explore worlds beyond Asgard and Midgard, and innovating more details around this absurd universe. Because if your source material have a world this rich, it makes your everyday reality look boring. It's a fine escapism, but the joy stumbles when it goes to the storyline. It's almost like the opposite of the first movie. Here, it works better when it simply shows the heroes fighting off the bad guys, but feels forced when it tries to pull off a drama. The overall film can be entertaining, but it messes a lot of elements within the surfaces.The big problem already lies by justifying the word ""dark"" in the title. While being dark and serious is not really a problem to this modern era of blockbusters, the film never felt natural for it. Though, the first movie was more special when it was focused on the drama, here it definitely feels force. There are those ""tragic"" or ""emotional"" scenes when it feels so contrived for the sake of fitting and pleasing the audience who seek for sheer deepness. The result is surprisingly not compelling, which makes you wish it was handled by Kenneth Branagh again. The film also suffers with a weak plot, there are large parts where the good guys are lingering to brood, making plans, and just goofing around while they're surrounded by a formidable enemy. Those moments they waste pretty much kills the momentum.The movie is better when it stays loyal to the roots of a Marvel picture. Staying in the action and the comedy is when the film felt more comfortable, although it may get out of hand. The cast gives plenty of life, as always, especially when Tom Hiddleston is around to spice things up. Director Alan Taylor seems to be more interested in creating inventive action set pieces and featuring stuff that we don't normally see in the genre, which helps a lot to bring pure energy within the adventure, while the CGI effects bring massive scale in any world they stop in to.Thor: The Dark World had its fun moments, but also suffers by its missteps. The recent trend of ""darkening"" almost every latest superhero movie somewhat affects it. Having drama scenes is definitely not the problem since the first movie was fascinating because of those parts. The real problem is how the film delivers them, it instead makes them look preachy and pretentious. It would have been a straightforward quest, because that's where the film works better. If the whole film is completely adventurous and full of personality, then it might end up being somehow remarkable. Still, Thor needs some pizazz to its gravity to make it more than just another action blockbuster. For now, Thor: The Dark World is fine enough as a distraction.",Thor - The Dark World
145,Rickting,Certainly far from a Marvel,4,20 December 2014,"This movie sucks. It's a shame as I quite like the Marvel Cinematic Universe and they've been consistent, but now the cracks are starting to show. There are only so many times we can see the same formula over and over again. This time, Thor deals with an alien invasion of earth and various other bland things happen. Thor The Dark World is a sequel to Thor, which wasn't a terrible film with its humour and character development, but it was a blockbuster built from anti-climaxes which devolved as it went along. This one is definitely worse and its contending with Iron Man 2 for the worst Marvel film to date. This is well acted up to a point, as Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston and Anthony Hopkins remain excellent. As usual, as an obscene amount of money is spent on these Marvel films, the special effects are excellent and you get the usual Marvel thrills and laughs, although in a more subdued way than normal. In a nutshell, TTDW is the Marvel formula done with far less effort.Another thing this suffers from are annoying human characters. Why on earth is an Oscar winner like Natalie Portman playing such a bland comic book girlfriend? None of the other characters are much fun either. It has a laughably bad villain who is some dark elf alien who not even Christopher Eccleston to make interesting. The action sequences are cardboard and lack any real dimension. They're just the same old stuff; plus haven't we seen enough of London getting destroyed in 2013 movies? In general, you don't feel most of the thrills and jokes and the story just goes the motions by half heartedly dumping crowd pleasing stuff such as jokes, fight scenes and special effects in there. When on earth, we get loads of annoying humans and when in space the film feels like a video game. TTDW isn't even a movie. It's a manufactured factory product coming off an assembly line, made purely for Marvel fanboys and Marvel fanboys alone. Lifeless and lacklustre, this effortless sequel takes the MCU to dark new places.4/10",Thor - The Dark World

148,TheSquiss,The cinematic equivalent of wearing all your favourite clothes at once.,5,27 November 2013,"Kenneth Branagh's take on Thor (2011) was a surprising departure for him but it worked. The sequel, Thor: The Dark World, works less well. It's entertaining, there's plenty of noise and digital effects, but it's the cinematic equivalent of wearing all your favourite clothes at once.Like the original, it is credited to two directors: TV director for hire, Alan Taylor and James Gunn, who was partly responsible for the execrable Movie 43. Presumably the producers realized from the outset that it was too unwieldy for one man to handle alone. What a pity they didn't do something about it before production began.When the Dark Elves, a race hitherto thought to be extinct, rock up and have a go at trashing Asgard, Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is decidedly narked and sends Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and friends to sort the mess out. Thor decides the best ally to have is his bother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), releases him from prison, sets off to Earth for some quality time in the company of old friends, including Jane (Natalie Portman), and redesigns Greenwich.Thor: The Dark World isn't a poor film, it's just messy and has been loaded with far too many ingredients to be fully cohesive or comprehendible. It's part sci-fi fantasy, part Harry Potter, part Lord of the Rings, has a smidgen of slapstick humour, a dollop of action, makes a half-hearted attempt at profundity and has been haphazardly stirred with shovel. We know there should be something in it for everyone but it's not quite possible to discern exactly what that something is.The fanboys will love it, those with a penchant for all things superhero will want to tick it off their 'must-see' list and parents seeking a diversion for bored kids could do far worse than to sit through two hours of this pleasurable mayhem.Thor: The Dark World is big, loud and chaotic but it's fun.

149,RevRonster,Better than the first!,10,12 November 2013,"I'm a huge comic book geek and have been loving this undertaking that Marvel Studios has taken with their shared cinematic universe. I thought it couldn't get any better than ""The Avengers"" but the Phase II films were set up with a terrific, introspective and surprising film in the shape of ""Iron Man 3"" and now ""Thor: The Dark World"" comes in and continues an epic build up to the next Avengers film.I actually believe this film was better than Thor's first movie (and I LOVED that one!) because we get to see a film that simultaneously has a larger, galactic focus but is still personal as it develops Thor and Jane's love and Thor and Loki's bitter sibling rivalry. Not to mention we also get a villain that is able to fill in Loki's shoes as the antagonist perfectly. While Malekith may not be a recognizable name to non-comic fans, Christopher Eccleston really brought the character to life and made him chilling and foreboding.Finally, the special effects are fantastic, we get to see more of Asgard than we did in the first film, the make-up effects were just absolutely stunning, the action is intense and exciting and the movie is very, very funny! Plus, we get to see more of Heimdell and whenever you get more Idris Elba in a film, you win! ""Thor: The Dark World"" really felt like a comic book come to life and is how a comic adaptation should be. It's just plain fun, action packed and filled with larger-than-life characters.Hi!

Oh wait I'm writing this so attention well and truly on a holiday.The only thing good about it is Tom Hiddlestone. He says his lines as though he means them and understands them.The film is unengaging and I find the actors unconvincing. I saw the first movie and it was just OK. In this one however I find Idris Elba wasted and unbelievable as a character. Even Anthony Hopkins seemed to have just turned up for the cash. Loads of special effects and CGI especially in the Asgard scenes but if the story is not involving then they count for nothing. The female friend of Jane - can't remember her name- seems to have wandered in from some teen movie and is as irritating as hell! I just do not care about anyone in this movie at all.

Let's just face it how many times can an alien being destroy a city, put the hero and his friends in jeopardy before you just get tired. This is the problem with Thor, you just get tired while watching it. Thor just isn't drawn in this installment interesting enough. He was a great fish out of water in the first movie, a egoist brought down by kindness and guilt. In this movie he's just sad and mopey. It doesn't help that his lady love is silly and not very supportive. Jane Foster is window dressing instead of partner.

155,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Bland Hammer,3,8 November 2013,"The first THOR was a hard sell A demigod with long blond hair and an ancient hammer isn't your typical brooding comic book hero And so the earthlings, including Natalie Portman's Jane, a beautifully brainy love interest and her colleagues, including sarcastic hipster chick Darcy, who, using a snarky monotone, second-guesses the bizarre situation, helped make the audience believe this was all really happeningBut after THE AVENGERS, we don't need further confirmation. Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth, is very real and his home-world Asgard is in danger because of a monolithic structure Jane discovers between worlds Part of which enters her body And when she quickly travels with Thor to Asgard, the stranger in a strange land concept doesn't quite work like when Thor came to earthAlthough a worthy actress, Portman's tone/voice sounds more like a valley girl in a local arcade. Meanwhile, back on earth, as the scientists gather to figure things out, Darcy's forced comic relief is annoying, distracting, and downright unfunnyThankfully there's Thor's ""brother"", that instigative menace from THE AVENGERS who, locked into a permanent glass structure, is freed to help destroy the big bad (and completely uninteresting) villain Thankfully, the dependable Loki, like Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor in SUPERMAN 2 after being replaced as the central villain keeps the dry humor flowing – some lines hit, other miss, but that's the best thing DARK WORLD has going for it: the camaraderie between two polar opposite brothers in a colorful world where dazzling special effects have an old school matte painting aesthetic, while space ships zoom around like in the STAR WARS (or current STAR TREK) universeIt's when Thor joins the small band of earthlings to thwart the city-ravaging beast, while strategically jumping from various wormholes into either dimension, that things gets convoluted, ponderous, and with a second AVENGERS already planned, somewhat pointless too",Thor - The Dark World

157,richieandsam,A good sequel.,7,6 May 2014,"THOR: THE DARK WORLDAs sequels go, I was expecting this to be quite bad... but to be honest, I liked it as much as the original movie.The movie is about Jane Foster. Jane was the love interest in the original movie and she has now been hot with something that has given her a strange power. Thor returns to Earth to protect her from the evil Dark Elves.This is a very worthy sequel. It was made after the Avengers Assemble, so if you are going to watch these movies in order, then watch the original Thor, then the Avengers Assemble and then this.The story is really good. I like the way that Jane has got more involved in the fight this time around. Thor takes her up to Asgard to protect her so most of the movie is set up there. As I have stated in the original review, the vision of Asgard is so colourful and beautiful so I was happy that a lot more of the movie was set up there.As before, the effects were very good and the fighting scenes were great. The action was a lot of fun and kept you glued to the screen.The main thing I didn't like about this film was how quickly Thor had forgiven Loki for what he had done. Thor needs his help and understand that, but he should never forgive him for destruction and death he has caused in the last 2 movies. It just didn't feel right.The movie stars Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins, Tom Hiddleston and Christopher Eccleston. The acting seemed better in this movie than the last one. It was great to see Christopher in this. I have always liked him and thought he did a great job in this.The make-up looked great too... the creatures looked really creepy and fit in really well into the movie.This is a good movie and if you enjoyed the original one then you will like this.""Well done, you just decapitated your Grandfather.""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",Thor - The Dark World
158,Al_The_Strange,Thor: The Dark World review,8,9 November 2013,"Thor - Norse God of thunder and perhaps one of the most surprising additions to Marvel lore - returns to his fantastic universe that blurs the line between ancient myth and science fiction. Kenneth Branaugh's film has always felt like a ""good but not great"" affair, so this sequel had nowhere to go but up.Naturally, there are loads of great action scenes throughout the film, with Asgardians, humans, and dark elves fighting on land, sea, air, and space. Among the film's highlights, the elves' raid on Asgard is a fantastic sequence with spaceships zooming around the city with dazzling laser beams and mass destruction. The final act presents a wildly imaginative sequence with characters duking it out across multiple worlds. In between, the film goes through plenty of compelling drama, but a lot of it is ultimately crushed by the comedy; hardly a moment goes by without something funny or ridiculous.The story continues after the first Thor film and The Avengers in a logical manner, continuing the established character arcs. The plot goes through a pretty standard structure, but it is far from predictable; there are a few surprising twists and turns, and the film takes the characters to bold new directions. A lot of the characters are fairly one-dimensional (especially Thor himself, the main antagonist, and the scientist characters, who are there mostly for comic relief), but everybody's favorite supervillain, Loki, easily steals the spotlight. Fortunately, most of these characters are likable (save for Darcy, who I think is cute, but many complain is overbearing). It's largely the villain who comes out as the weakest link, lacking in depth or range.This film pretty standard photography, with some good movements and angles, which let the action scenes flow and speak for themselves. Editing struck me as being a little screwy in a few scenes, but is mostly spot-on. Acting is good: Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, and Anthony Hopkins all reprise their roles admirably (Hiddleston has especially grown into his role most comfortably). Natalie Portman continues to play a rather ditzy love interest, but she is given more to do in this film. Everybody else is decent, although I don't think Christopher Eccleston stood out much at all. Writing is not bad, although I felt that the film's explanation of the Aether and its connection with things like dark matter and the universe in general was pretty weak (pretty much technobabble just for the sake of it). This production has decent-looking sets, props, and costumes. Most special effects are cool, but I thought that some of the backgrounds and starfields looked a little low-rez. Music is alright.I find Thor: The Dark World is a grade more enjoyable than the first film, and it's worth seeing to see the characters' progression and plenty of otherworldly action. It's an easy recommendation for fans of the Marvel films.4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Good)",Thor - The Dark World

160,willcundallreview,The Hammer wielding superhero is back,6,5 September 2014,"Thor: The Dark World is a comic book superhero movie that although maybe not containing the most thrilling of plot lines, still manages to churn out a fun film. With a lot of humour to add to the plot it could be said this is one superhero movie that doesn't always take itself so seriously and shows that Thor can do more than just one film. I felt by the end that it was a firmly OK movie and here below is why so.The story is kind of confusing like at times, it jumps from one thing to another and although you won't be lost, some scenes are fairly quick and dialogue can be missed. I did enjoy the action side of the film and the scenes shown containing fights etc are well laid out so that the film never gets to dull for the viewer. It tries to crack a few jokes here and there and they can be funny at times, if anything it lightens the movie up in parts.I found Chris Hemsworth to be good, not great but he does the job he is supposed to do and it has to be said he is well choreographed all the way through. Natalie Portman is OK but can maybe seem just slightly under acting but is usually saved by fellow cast members. Tom Hiddleston well I wasn't too sure on him in this second instalment, I felt he tried too hard to be the big sinister guy in certain scenes and although by the end he has done an OK job, still just a little over the top.It is well directed and to say the effects are so big and expansive in this movie, Alan Taylor seems to finish this up well. I wasn't always too keen on the script whilst watching and although I think it improves as the movie progresses, it still could do with a few tweaks here and there. On the point of effects, they are everywhere it would seem but not bad at all and contribute very well to the thrills felt throughout the film.The main negativity coming from this is the way in which it has too much a complicated plot that isn't a smart one, I mean that in the sense that it could be intelligent and well thought out but by the end the story seems to be only about attracting box office receipts. Wasn't also always too keen on the acting side but people such as Hemsworth really start to regain control of that part of the film and stop it fading badly.For the fan of superheroes or comics, this could be said to be not the best of them but still highly recommend if you really want a lot of action with an epic back story. If your not a fan I would still say go and see, it has a certain air of comedic charm which kind of make it feel a bit different to other such films and not always trying to be too serious.Overall I felt It to be Firmly Pleasing and a film that never quite loses the aim of the game. My review may seem very negative indeed but in many cases it is not bad, hugely enjoyable in parts, confusing but fun in others this is one Superhero movie that could by the very end, very much split opinion among people.",Thor - The Dark World

165,p-jonsson,"Great action, special effects, superhero movie",9,29 March 2014,"There have been plenty of movies based on classical cartoon superheroes that have been poorly implemented and with a lousy story. Luckily this one is not one of those. This was really a very enjoyable movie and I liked this movie a lot better than the first Thor movie which I felt was mostly silly.This one has a story which was rather okay and held somewhat together. You have to remember that this is a comic book hero and the story is on that level of course. The special effects and the scenery is really nice as well. The views of Asgard is cool, almost breathtaking.Anthony Hopkins was excellent as Odin or Oden has he is called in Sweden, my country of birth. Tom Hiddleston is also very good in his role although I have to say that I really do not like his role but then he is supposed to be one of the bad guys so Chris Hemsworth is good enough in his role but I would say that he is really the weakest ones in terms of acting.The movie is liberally sprinkled with jokes as well and, thankfully, most of them are not too bad. Although a bit silly I have to say that I did laugh when Thor politely hung Mjölnir on the clothes rack in the apartment with Darcy and Dr. Selvig.On the whole I enjoyed this movie tremendously.",Thor - The Dark World
166,xamtaro,Tries to be too much like Avengers and Iron Man,7,19 November 2013,"Lightning does not strike twice with the follow up to 2011's THOR. Thor The Dark World does not live up to the standard set by its predecessor. Although it ups the ante with the action, it lacks that personal focus of the first movie. Thankfully, a stellar cast and amazing chemistry saves the movie from falling into mindless blockbuster territory.With a combined movie universe, it begs the question of how come other heroes do not appear to intervene in the various world shattering crises that other heroes face in their individual movies. THOR: THE DARK WORLD provides just such an explanation by setting most of its action off earth. After the events of AVENGERS, Thor leads an Asgardian force to bring peace back to the 9 realms. On earth Jane Foster, Thor's love interest from the first film, stumbles on an anomalous place with portals that transports items, and herself, to another world; the so called ""Dark World"". There, she unwittingly bonds with an ancient weapon of tremendous power called the Aether. This alerts the evil Dark Elves, technologically advanced ancient enemies of Asgard, and their leader Malekith.As villains go, Malekith and his Dark elves are no where as memorable as one would have hoped. Like a crossbreed of LORD OF THE RINGS's Uruk-Hai with STAR WAR's Sith Lords and Clone Troopers. They have superpowered ""Kursed"" warriors, who are like Berserkers on steroids, they have space age technology centered around the manipulation of gravity (and novel use of mini-black hole grenades); all these are quite cool but seem to clash with the more fantasy-tech of Asgard. Malekith himself is a one note villain who is out to destroy all realms. Zero depth, zero development. Then again, what do you expect? He is not the star of this movie.What Thor The Dark World succeeds very much in is its world building. It crafts and expands upon the Marvel movie universe, adding much needed history and depth to the people of Asgard. This depth extends to the characters; this time focused mainly on the relationship between Thor, Loki and their parents. While Chris Hemsworth does a marvellous job as a heroic yet humble Thor, Tom Hiddelston is magnificent as Loki. He just oozes nuance in his performance, portraying the trickster as a truly tormented soul torn between the love for his mother and the hatred for his brother. You never know his true intentions or where his loyalties lie. If anything, this is more of a Loki movie than a Thor movie where your tragic villain outshines the titular character, stealing every scene he is in.Sadly, this leads to all the problems inherent in the movie. THOR: THE DARK WORLD has a great story. Yet its execution is muddled in direction and its general look and feel. Also, its character development is almost non existent except for Loki. As it opens up the Marvel cinematic universe into the far reaches of space age science fiction, the whole thing feels very much like the ""Star Wars"" prequels. High speed chases in space ships accompany the ever present laser guns, cloaking technology and plasma turrets. That sequence where Thor and Loki escape a blockaded Asgard with Jane just reeks of a similar scene in STAR WARS EPISODE 1.Then there are the romance and comedy. For most of the movie you have Thor and Jane pinning for each other like teenage love birds. Once together, they clearly look like they should be in love yet there is feeling of ""fakeness"" to their romance. Thankfully such scenes are few, with the focus on bigger action. In this department, the movie does not disappoint. The action is clearly of an epic scale and the stakes are high. Yet the movie sees fit to throw in as much inappropriate humor as possible into such heavy scenes. The humor just does not fit and in fact pulls us out of the moments. Moments where reality itself is crumbling and a character cracks a joke just feels like Disney at work again, killing another chance to take comic book superheroes seriously.Alas THOR: THE DARK WORLD is not a bad movie, it is good. It is just not as good as the first THOR movie, and this is likely due to executive meddling trying to get all new Marvel movies to follow the tone of Avengers. In trying to squeeze different types of stories into a single mold (no doubt to further cement their shared universe concept), you kill what made the concept great to begin with. Gone is Patrick Doyle's unique and spirit lifting symphony replaced by Brian Tyler's disappointing rehash of his CHILDREN OF DUNE soundtrack spliced with LORD OF THE RINGS and (believe it or not) Marvel's AVENGERS.In a similar vein, gone is what made THOR unique to begin with. It may not be a typical mindless blockbuster, but it is becoming a typical Marvel movie. Like Iron Man 3, like Avengers, and quite possible like all subsequent marvel movies; chock full of comedy, big action and cartoon style dialogue with no effort to try and take superheroes seriously or to craft a deep themed tale of costumed vigilantes gifted with awesome powers.",Thor - The Dark World
167,Mike_Devine,'Dark World' more of the same - with a weaker plot,6,24 December 2017,"2013's follow-up to the Chris Hemsworth-starring Marvel film 'Thor' is one that didn't excite audiences the way other films in the genre have, and has become somewhat overlooked in the studio's library. It's true - 'Thor: The Dark World' was more or less a ""bridge"" movie to get from the bigger hit that was 'Iron Man 3' to the superior 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier,' but it served its purpose.At the center of 'Dark World' is an ancient force called the Aether that takes hold of Thor's love interest Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). What ensues is a multidimensional cat-and-mouse chase in a race to save Jane and put an end to the destructive plans of an evil elf named Malekith (Christopher Eccleston). So, pretty standard plot for a superhero movie, and much less interesting than the previous film's plot.While the 'Thor' franchise boasts some memorable characters who have good resumes, including Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Odin (Anthony Hopkins), Eric (Stellan Skarsgård) and Darcy (Kat Dennings), their performances in this sequel feel just like a continuation of the first movie - nothing new or special. This applies to the dialogue, as well - it's well written considering the genre, with enough cheekiness and wit to go around, but again, it's same old, same old.As per usual, the special effects are great. The world of Asgard comes to life through the CGI, as do the barren lands of ""the dark world"" (which was aptly filmed in Iceland). But other than these elements, the film is fairly forgettable.'Thor: The Dark World' was a necessary entry in the Marvel film universe, and should be seen as a ""cross off the list"" kind of movie, but it's not near the top of the list when it comes to quality.",Thor - The Dark World

170,kgprophet,Sleepy Operatic Second Installment,4,23 March 2014,"Of all the current Marvel super heroes who enjoy their own solo films, Thor is my least favourite. I remember going through the whole Greek mythology in grade school and never could get into it. The other turn-off is the focus on yucking it up with the younger characters. Leave the goofy relationship material to television shows. Then there is the decision to turn the great Stellan Skarsgard (I remember him back in ""Hunt For Red October"") into a humiliating clown character. As an audience member, I was embarrassed for such a high brow film to stoop to such broad comedy gags.There is considerable amount of time spent on other planets to setup all the rivalries and bad guys. The film lacks any punch, as it goes through the confrontations, it all plays out like an extended stage opera. The characters are in their grandiose outfits making grandiose pronouncements. All against large backdrops (yes you can tell it's all CGI). Anthony Hopkins is getting on in his age and his performance lacks fire. Tom Hiddleston, the great baddie from The Avengers, is literally sitting on the sidelines for the whole film.About an hour into watching it on DVD for the second time (the first time I saw it in the theatre I fell asleep three times), I realised the main problem with this movie is the sappy music. The soundtrack is the most boring generic underscoring I have heard in a long time. The music lacks any stingers to grab the audience, no depth in it's arrangements. It is amazing how just one aspect of a film can help kill it. Even when things pick up in the third act as London is ground zero for the big alien invasion. The production values are definitely there (although the 170 million price tag seems a bit much). The direction and editing is also just there, no flare or real energy in the story's momentum.Even though it clocks in at 1 hour 52 minutes, I swear it felt over two hours. I would still recommend this minor installment in the Marvel family of films, but not if you're sleepy.",Thor - The Dark World
171,W011y4m5,Studio Involvement Wastes Potential.,6,26 March 2019,"One of the most promising films in the MCU's history - yet equally the most disappointing.
Alan Taylor has been pretty frank & open in countless interviews regarding his ""particularly wrenching"" behind the scenes experience in helming this movie during the post-production process, admitting he was granted full creative freedom during pre-production & principal photography, only to have his project unexpectedly hijacked & all control seized from him by executives in the editing room - & it shows...
Expertly utilising his skills in capturing fictional, yet striking fantasy locations (a talent previously showcased in HBO's Game of Thrones), the director undeniably breathes new life into the world of Asgard & totally reinvents the aesthetic to seem more grounded & realistic & most importantly, lived in; the spectacular goliath landscape suddenly evolves in to something increasingly believable to audiences; well-realised & more appropriately representing the Norse mythology these Gods initially originated from. To summarise, the faultless world building is utterly incredible & it's no surprise the film decides to spend noticeably more time within Thor's homeworld than in the first by Kenneth Branagh. Moreover, it's really worth acknowledging Kramer Morgenthau's stunning cinematography here too as he somehow manages to enrich the visuals even further in order to create an impressively deeper colour palette which - even to this day - is distinguishable from the rest & unlike any MCU movie which preceded or even followed this installment afterwards, making each & every image in the frame pop with a genuine beauty - accentuating the darkness of the black present in shadows on screen, avoiding the usual dull, lifeless, muted greys we're normally accustomed to from this particular franchise.
In addition, Alan & outstanding cast member Christopher Eccleston (who is SO underrated) have both been brutally honest in subsequent discussions about their aversion to featuring a stereotypical, two-dimensional villain (or a ""cackling fiend"", to quote them directly); preliminary talks began between the two of them for the former Doctor Who star to assume the role of the lead antagonist under the shared pretence that Malekith would be complex; both his backstory & motivations were to be explored to their fullest potential.
The Dark Elves were therefore supposed to be three-dimensional & well-developed nemeses - & would've broken the continuous Marvel tradition of only including forgettable villains. Thus, both Alan & Christopher spent a lot of time devising an entire civilisation, crafting an individualistic language, societal construct & hierarchy that the opposing species would inhabit so as not to fall in to the same avoidable trap - endeavouring to provide the protagonist's rivals with a constant perceptible presence by having them possess a ""regal"" sense of ""gravitas"" & ""aristocracy"", with a feeling of their ""ancientness"", gifting them a ""sense of entitlement & bearing"" throughout. The relationship between Malekith & Kurse was also apparently intended to be elaborated on in more detail... But those moments of development ended up on the cutting room floor too.
Deleted scenes which were released have but given just a mere glimpse of what more we could've also expected & it's clear Thor: The Dark World began as a character driven, uncharacteristically dark, mature, grounded installment in the MCU which told a self contained story that primarily focused on progressing the narrative of our recognisable & beloved heroes but unfortunately, this wasn't on brand with the Marvel Universe, was likely seen as ""unsafe"" / a little too daring / risky, possessing a lack of comedic laughs etc. & so as a result, the movie was cut to make it ""faster"", ""tighter"" & ""funnier"" at the expense of everything that made it unique & different from the rest.
It's such a shame to see this effort & conscientiousness squandered unappreciatively by Disney - particularly when Alan knowingly sacrificed his alternative opportunity to helm at least one other episode of Game of Thrones for the following season, S3 (likely ""The Red Wedding"" of all the ones to turn down). Truly, as a consequence, he was forced to pass on the chance to retain his previous titles as his schedule wouldn't allow it (he was too busy with Thor) & instead, he invested his time in perfecting the sequel before its inevitable release. It can't be stated enough how Taylor took a major personal risk with his career in exiting the show as lead director / co-producer when it was at its strongest (& we should be mindful of that); his committment to the film was deserving of praise & gratitude. Not to mention, that gamble should've paid off & his devotion to the 2013 blockbuster should've been fairly rewarded in return so to witness that brave risk sadly end in cataclysmic failure (for reasons beyond his control) is ridiculously disheartening & tragic.
It's no surprise whatsoever he backed petitions for a director's cut because what's left of his movie are the bare bones of a fascinatingly original solo Thor outing - which you can enjoy & appreciate if you watch closely enough, but it's still ridiculously frustrating to know the story could've had far more meat on those bones - meat you'd actually have been able to sink your teeth into - as opposed to the mere scraps of it we were finally discarded by the end.
In hindsight, Alan Taylor is just another victim of overbearing studio involvement - from a company which failed to respect his artistic integrity by supporting his creative vision. He wasn't the first to be treated with this kind of contempt & as we know, he certainly wasn't the last either. What we do know is if Disney wishes to right the wrongs of its past like Warner Bros has attempted to do, it should seriously consider this idea: #ReleaseTheTaylorCut",Thor - The Dark World

Since I was practically skimming through all the movies, I only remembered the ones that had something absolutely memorable to show. This one, however, I barely remembered anything, except for the scene where it was shown in the end that Odin was actually Loki. That's not to say that this movie is bad. That's just saying it's... forgettable.Thor: The Dark World is a movie that I only remember in fragments. I remember a castle exploding in which Thor's mother died but nothing before or after that. I remember Loki being upset because he had been imprisoned and was throwing tantrums but nothing after that. Normally if a movie is so forgettable like it was in the case of X-Men: Apocalypse or Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, I just watch the trailers, Honest Trailers, Pitch Meetings, Cinemasins etc to remember everything that happened in that movie. But I'm not gonna do it here. I want to see how much I can review based on what I thought of it on my first watching.The cinematography of this movie is pathetic, so is the CGI. Normally I prefer aliens having a bad CGI as in the case of Zack Snyder's Justice League since it gives a video game-like touch to it, but here it's just... trash. And what's the deal with the camera always being tilted sideways in many scenes? The characters were straight up terrible. The whole ""intern of an intern"" and punching Thor in the face to check if he's real (I don't remember if it was a slap or punch) wasn't even funny yet both the jokes happened twice. Also Thor hung his Mjolnir on a nail so that we could know it's not actually heavy. As I'm writing this review I'm remembering what all happened in it, but still not very nicely.I actually fell asleep while watching Thor: The Dark World, something I have never done for any other movie before. That's how slowly paced and boring it was. The talking scenes were a little too much and were barely audible. I think I really need to watch it one more time if I have to just get a basic idea of what it was. This could have been the MCU movie I hated the most if it wouldn't have been for Loki.

Action, special effects, and setting are not bad at all but it's still hard to justify the absolutely pointless plot and nonexistent villain. Thor and Jane's love story gets some more space with some troubles happening this time, but still lacks any kind of chemistry or reason to exist at all.",Thor - The Dark World
175,gavinp9,"Another decent superhero film, which is entertaining enough, even if it sometimes tries a little too hard to be something it's not.",7,2 January 2018,"'Thor: The Dark World' (or 'Thor 2') is another solid entry into the Marvel Universe - it's not the best superhero film, nor is it the worst. I'm glad they've kept the cast together and hopefully Marvel can do this across all their franchises, as it gives them a bit of authenticity. It's fun to see how they link some of the threads back to 'The Avengers', particularly with Dr Erik Selvig (Skarsgård).Now, I don't know who out there actually loves Thor, because he's certainly one of my least favourite Marvel characters, especially in the comics, as he's so rigid and boring and never does anything too exciting. He's certainly no Wolverine or Spiderman. And that's the film's biggest hurdle - how to make Thor and the story interesting for 110min. It sort-of achieves this... I know it's mostly set in Asgard, a different realm, but even then there are still a few things which stretch credibility:
Why do the ""Dark Elves of Svartalfheim"" wear puppet masks? And why do they want to destroy the universe and - presumably - themselves?What exactly is the ""Ether""? It's not just an alkaline chemical...Where exactly is the ""Dark World""? Is it on Asgard, or is it another realm? Is it different to the ""Limbo"" dimension?Is Benicio Del Toro actually needed at the end of the film?Why is Asgard so poorly defended?Why does the final confrontation take place on Earth, where the Dark Elves can be easily found? And why can't the other Avengers - or the Fantastic Four, or the X-Men - help? Especially if the future of the universe is at stake? Seems unlikely S.H.I.E.L.D. would leave this up to Thor by his lonesome...One of the big saving graces is some of the witty laughs provided by Chris O'Dowd and Kat Dennings (plus Stan Lee's patented cameo!). There's some expertly timed quips thrown in, which add some levity to what could easily become quite a cumbersome story. I think that Hopkins was pretty wasted as Odin, Hemsworth has some decent moments as Thor, but Hiddleston as Loki once again almost steals the show, because even though you may hate him, he's often so likable!

Asgard is in danger and all of life hangs in the balance as Thor must find a way to defeat the monster.

And almost everybody here excels though Tom Hiddleton as Loki deserves special notice. But the story could definitely be built better. And I'm not speaking about the plausibility of the basic premise, as I said more than once the entire idea of a living super hero calls for some suspension of judgment, but if this super hero operates inside our own world, some other laws of logic must apply, and many of those are ignored here.

Thor was a thoroughly enjoyable comic book adaptation. Now, Thor: The Dark World has just been released and while it maintains some awesome action sequences and some humor to keep it going, it does lack some of the emotion that made its predecessor so good. Not by any means is Thor: The Dark World a bad film, quite the contrary, it is a very well made film and features some of the coolest action sequences we've seen in 2013. However, this sequel seems to dwell on the coattails of the original and never seems to fully stand on its own two legs. Featuring one awesome performance from Tom Hiddleston as Loki, the rest of actors seem to fall beneath him and end up being lackluster compared to him. Chris Hemsworth does what he can with the role but there isn't too much more that he could do with the character of Thor that he didn't do in the original, so therefore, I can't fully put him at fault. The rest of the cast ends up being an afterthought when the end credits roll. The biggest failure of Thor: The Dark World is that it tries to best the original by adding more action and less story (something that sequels are infamous for). Now, while the action sequences are undeniably cool and entertaining, there isn't much more to it. The threat doesn't feel real in this outing and that brings the film down from where it could have been. With that being said, the bright side is that the action sequences are so well done and Hiddleston is outstanding as Loki, I can't fully disregard this film.

The plot is straight out of 'Lord of the Rings.' The dark side of life portrayed by the Black Elves (very reminiscent of The Teletubbies!) are rising (originally the Universe was dark until Thor's Grandad sent them packing and brought the Light). However, the Elves' main ultimate weapon - the Aether (cue misty red smoke) - was not destroyed but buried beneath a fifties car park in East London!!!! Where's that Ring when you need it?! Thor's girlfriend (Natalie Portman - the Elves are taller than her!)discovers it and becomes a carrier - fortunately she does not suffer Gollum's fate of disfigurement. Now that would have been a plot twist! The rest of the film is the Black Elves trying to get hold of the Aether while Thor, Loki and assorted London-based Earthlings attempt to prevent them. The best bit is the relationship between Thor and Loki with some good acting from Hemsworth and Hiddlestone, but the attack on Asgard is a copy of Michael Shannon's rebellious effort on Krypton, and from then on in the plot holes get bigger and bigger. True, the destruction of Greenwich - as Thor and Chief Baddie battle it out - does not go on as long as 'Man of Steel' in New York, but is a yawnfest.

We have arrived at a point where VFX can't hardly improve anymore but in The Dark World they pulled out all the stops: we get gorgeous vistas, battles and large scale destruction effects and not a single shot looks fake. Chris Hemsworth also seems to be getting more familiar with his character as his performance has certainly improved.

It is all that a movie of this genre should be in the first place (and, for example, Green Lantern was not): an illusion of reality that entertains. No morals, no subtle messages. Plain simple, yet intelligent, script, fun, action (with destruction, of course), very good acting (considering the ""circumstances""; the casting was excellent), direction, editing and music. SFX is really superb and very convincing. This movie sort of sucks you in, relieving you of all the bad mood or frustrations you had before watching it. It delivers. It makes you sleep well afterward. Highly recommended for those moments when you need something to make you feel - ""this was made for me"". Now grab what you usually do before a (really) good movie and watch it. And have fun. People that made this movie did it for you, not just themselves :)",Thor - The Dark World

188,galahad58-1,Better than the first,8,17 November 2013,"Thor is a decent movie that really entertains with eye-popping visuals. The story is limited, but it works for a comic book adaptation. The direction is well done and works with the limited skills available.Tom Hiddleston is the reason to watch this movie. Tom is great as Loki and brings a lot of depth and life to the character. Tom looks like he is having fun with the role and provides the spirit that this movie needs to be successful.Chris Hemsworth is there for the women to look at and that is all. I do not believe that he is a great choice for Thor, but this is who Thor is now in movie land. He grunts, he growls, he acts like a WWF wrestler and has no personality at all. The Hulk has more personality than Hemsworth's version of Thor and he is the reason that this movie does not rise to a 9 or 10. If it were not for Hiddleston; Hemsworth would pull this down to a 6 rating. ""Me Thor"" ""Me Smash"" is the kind of stuff that basically comes out of his mouth and he is not very likable.As I mentioned above Hemsworth is not a positive for this movie--except for those looking at his looks instead of his huge inability to act---Asgardian inability. The supporting cast carries this movie: Anthony Hopkins is wonderful as Odin and brings class to this film; Rene Russo does a nice job; Kat Dennings brings some much needed humor and heart to the movie; and Stellan Skarsgård makes Erik Selvig such a likable character in the Marvel universe. This is why his character has been in three movies and been successful.Skarsgard and Hiddleston are the true stars of this movie and they steal every scene that they are in.",Thor - The Dark World
189,gregeichelberger,"Once again, a sequel comes up short",5,15 November 2013,"There's nothing more disappointing than a sequel that does not live up to the original film it came from, therefore, my cinematic experiences over the years dealing with such efforts have certainly been tragic. Yes, there have been second films that have equaled or surpassed the original (""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""Superman 2,"" ""The Godfather: Part 2,"" just to name a very few), but these are as rare as Academy Award nominations from ""Weird Al"" Yankovic.So, die-hard Marvel Studios fans may want to exit this website now and forgo any bitterness they may feel when they realize this review — while not a whole dismissal of the newest superhero epic, ""Thor: The Dark World"" — may not exactly be what they want to read at this moment.True to my nature as an optimist, however, I will highlight the positive points of the new production. First, Chris Hemsworth is the perfect choice to play the stoic, unemotional, dispassionate, apathetic, unmoved Nordic leading deity to a tee (actually, I'm not sure these are good points). It does not require a whole lot of animation to jump from the sky, punch someone out or throw a hammer. Hemsworth does a very good job in his portrayal of such a character and, as long as he does not try to break the acting ceiling like he did in ""Snow White and the Huntsman,"" I think we'll be all right.The other good thing about this movie (and it's probably the best) is Loki (Tom Hiddleston, ""Midnight in Paris""), the deeply troubled younger (and let's not forget ADOPTED) brother of the first prince of Asgard. It's his third appearance in the role and he has grown quite comfortable as the smirking, conniving schemer. Here, he makes every scene he's in delectable. It's too bad he is not in more. Plus, the sequences where he appears with Hemsworth are not only the best in the picture, but they elevate the latter's status and acting credentials even higher than they should be.Okay, we have discussed the positive, now let's look at the concerns. Replacing first installment director Kenneth Branagh (who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director — and lead actor — for 1989′s ""Henry V"") eliminated the whole Shakespearian angle with the fallen brother, the troubled prince and world-weary king, which punctuated the action scenes and made for much more intelligent viewing than your average superhero narrative.Alan Taylor, while adept at television drama (several installments of ""Mad Men,"" ""Game of Thrones"" and a host of others), has not helmed a feature film since ""Kill the Poor"" in 2003. His contribution to this feature — at least as far as the Bard connection goes — is negligible and thus much of the drama of ""Thor"" is replaced with the mediocre of standard fights, screaming and explosions. Yes, ""Thor: The Dark World"" looks good, but there is a troubling blandness and sameness to the enterprise.Sadly underused (or misused in some cases) are Anthony Hopkins (""Red 2"") as King Odin, Natalie Portman (""Black Swan""), Stellan Skarsgård (""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"") as Dr. Erik Selvig and Christopher Eccleston (""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"") as the main villain — that's right, Loki isn't even to top bad guy here — Malekith. Hopkins is given even less screen time than in the first film, while Portman bitches and moans and nags so much about Thor being away one understands his reasoning completely. She is both bland and annoying, a difficult tightrope to walk (see ""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium"" for a perfect example).Meanwhile, Skarsgård has been reduced to a comic relief buffoon and Eccleston, who began his career in 1991 in a great little British film, ""Let Him Have It,"" is easily one of the worst Marvel villains of all-time, sort of a lightweight Bane, but without the menacing demeanor. Heavily made-up and CGIed to the point of complete obscurity, he comes back (after failing numerous time in the past) to use the all-powerful Aether to blow all of the realms to pieces, for whatever that's worth. The best spy, war and superhero movies have one thing in common — great and terrifying bad guys (Goldfinger, Darth Vader, Lex Luthor, Loki). Malekith is certainly a name few will remember in the annals of filmdom's evil malefactors.Few will remember the plot of ""Thor: The Dark World,"" as well. Basically Asgard is under assault from Malekith and Thor is forced to release Loki from prison (where he has been since the end of ""The Avengers"") to aid in the protection of the realms. The real drama is whether the kid brother can be trusted. Seems a logical concern to me. There are trips to other planets and Earth gets a few location shots. Monsters are destroyed, good guys are pounded and, for a while, we wonder if anyone can survive the onslaught of out-of-control special effects. One funny sequence involves Thor and Malekith bouncing around the universe while the mighty hammer of the Norse god struggles vainly just to keep up with the action.""Thor: The Dark World"" is nowhere near enough to surpass the first experience, and while not a bad movie at all, it just seems like a temporary diversion until a part three (or ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron"") comes out. Sadly, that's just not enough for a studio with a much better track record than this.",Thor - The Dark World
190,ivanmessimilos,Thor can be better superhero,6,22 September 2014,"Marvel has made a terrible machine for earning money, and it is still today a priority at the movies. I'm not saying that they recorded a very bad films, but to me they are just average (except for Iron Man and The Avengers). So record a movie and give a teaser to another, recording another, giving a teaser for the third, and so on ... What concerns the film itself, I was somewhat impressed. They're great cast assembled for this movie, but we know who will spend most of their time on the big screen. Fight scenes and CGI are superb as expected, but I still want something a little more than a movie. I liked Loki, who confirmed his class. The effects are excellent, although I felt a little robbed Star Wars, but alright. Of course, there is a scene after the credits, and then patience for a minute, if a little track you will see they announced another film in the world of Marvel. The new machine for printing money. DC what are you waiting for?!?!",Thor - The Dark World
191,Chalice_Of_Evil,Thor and Gotye team up to take down the Ninth Doctor...,8,31 October 2013,"Darcy! Jane! Selvig! Mjölnir! The gang's all back. For me, Thor was one of the best superhero movies to come out in recent time. I far preferred it to the overrated Iron Man films and wanted another. So here it is, and while it's not as good as the first one, it's still quite enjoyable. Chris Hemsworth, despite having the less flashy role next to Tom Hiddleston's Loki, is really very good. What made Thor so likable in the first film was that, despite his overconfidence and head-strong nature, he went on a character journey that changed him. He grew as a character and, thanks to Hemsworth's charm, you felt for him. He had lots of great little moments. Then he got royally screwed in The Avengers and was made a mockery of, which did a major disservice to him. This time around, he's back to strutting his stuff and doing what he does best: wielding his mighty hammer like no one else can. As for Hiddleston as Loki (who is now sporting long stringy dark hair that makes him look like a pale rocker from the 80's. Or, alternatively, the singer Gotye. Apparently they don't have hair gel in Asgard jail), while I wasn't blown away by him originally, I grew to like him in The Avengers and felt he was also made the butt of a joke in that film at the expense of his character. Now he's back once again, this time to make us wonder if he really *is* someone Thor can trust or is still as bad as ever. Evidently, his popularity is what keeps bringing him back. I can see why he has his fans, and Hiddleston is very good in the role, plus he has great banter with Thor. However, I personally feel it's about time we got a break from him. He shares some good scenes with Thor, Jane Foster gives him a much-deserved slap, and he even gets to have the odd hero moment (one of the best being when he saves Jane, then Thor saves him). We do see how much Thor truly cares for his brother, despite their differences. If only the films could let him go. You know it's all about Loki when the film basically begins/ends with him. It almost doesn't even feel like Thor's film anymore.I know Natalie Portman's Jane Foster has her haters, but she's actually right up there (along with Captain America's Peggy Carter) as one of my favourite love interests from any superhero film. Although she doesn't have super powers, she's clever and brave. I like that she's an astrophysicist and human. I thought both she and Hemsworth's Thor had nice chemistry in the first film, so I'm glad we got to see more of them together here. Yes, she's angry with him and slaps him - but it's understandable/warranted, given how he left her. To her credit, she doesn't stay mad for long once she learns what happened. With a magical force called the Aether inside of her this time, she proves pivotal to the storyline (gaining some striking blue eyes in the process. The effects used for the Aether are quite dazzling). The other humans are also good. Kat Dennings as Darcy still gets lots of funny moments (no one can say 'Mjölnir' as cutely as she does), while Erik Selvig often being naked or without pants shows the after effects of what was done to him in The Avengers. Fans of the Warriors Three & Lady Sif may be disappointed. While they didn't have *that* much screen time last time, they still managed to make the most of it and I came to care about them as characters. This time, they may get a bit more screen time, but it's not nearly enough. The real shame is the lack of Jaimie Alexander as kick-arse Sif. Yes, she has her moments, but she could've done with a LOT more. At least she plays a part in the sequence partway through the end credits. Zachary Levi (from TV series Chuck) makes the most of his time replacing Josh Dallas as Fandral. Anthony Hopkins as Odin, I felt, was better and had more presence in the last film. In this one, his character acts like Thor did originally before he grew as a person. The role reversal may be intentional, but I don't think it served Odin's character well. As for Thor's mum...well...at least she proves that she can kick a bit of arse herself, but unfortunately for her...now she's just somebody that Loki used to know (blame Loki's hair for all the Gotye references). At least we see that he *does* care for her, try as he might to hide it.Whilst the Dark Elves are interesting to look at and have some pretty neat gizmos at their disposal, they aren't particularly memorable. Nor is their leader, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston). The best thing about him is his epic fight with Thor, which takes them back & forth between worlds/different locations. The Frost Giants were better. The movie still has plenty of humour. Scenes such as Thor, Mjölnir & a coat rack, Thor on a train, or the one where Loki shows off his powers and we get an unexpected appearance from that other likable Avenger (Captain America) are just a few of many funny moments throughout. I didn't think I'd miss Kenneth Branagh and his love of tilting the camera diagonally, but I feel he was able to craft a superior film to this one. I also missed the original film's score (which had so much emotion to it). On the plus side, we get some nice eye-catching end credits this time, which are done in a painting style. The mid-credits scene is the most bizarre yet out of all the Marvel films, though don't miss the after-credits scene. Here's an idea: Thor & Captain America in their own buddy movie. Make it happen, Marvel!",Thor - The Dark World
192,Bruce722,Simply amazing!,10,11 November 2013,"Thor: The Dark World is definitely one of the best superhero films I've ever seen. The cast, led by Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman, did a great job once again. Supporting actors Tom Hiddleston, Idris Elba, Kat Dennings, Jaimie Alexander, Anthony Hopkins, and so many more really are amazing. I've heard a lot of complaints about the pace being too quick and difficult to keep up with. My response? Don't take stupid people to see the movie. I honestly don't see how anyone would have trouble keeping up with the pace of the film. I thought the plot development was actually one of the stronger parts of the film. Another strong element was the humor. Like the first installment, there was a lot of situational humor. However, this movie took it to an entirely new level and didn't feel forced and out of place. Most of this is thanks to the aforementioned Kat Dennings and her unique comedic flair. Also, watch for the Captain America cameo for maybe the most humorous scene in the film. The action sequences were up to par with the rest of the movies, meaning they were epic. Natalie Portman is as breathtaking as ever and the rest of the supporting cast adds a combination of depth and humor. The only negative in the movie, and I'm really not sure if it's a fair one, is that I wanted more Lady Sif. I'm sorry but you have one of the most beautiful women in the world, who happens to be a fantastic actress, playing one of the most badass and intriguing roles in the movie and she's barely even relevant? You've gotta do better than that. Supposedly she originally had a more prominent role even creating somewhat of a love triangle but the studio ultimately decided to trim that back, essentially eliminating a large chunk of her screen time. After some thought I decided it didn't really ""hurt"" the film so I won't let it affect the rating but I would've liked liked to see her more. Hopefully we'll get that in the special features when it releases on blu-ray. Overall, I'd say this is probably the third best Avengers film yet, behind Iron Man and The Avengers. Hopefully they continue to deliver because they've got one helluva series going.",Thor - The Dark World
193,FairlyAnonymous,"Better than the first, but not flawless",7,9 November 2013,"Well, the sequel is finally out! How does it fare? The action is amazing, the acting has drastically improved, and the villain is more intimidating and threatening than the last. Pretty much everything is improved upon in every way, but it still manages to trip in a couple of areas which ultimately took down the film's greatness a notch or two.The premise revolves around Dark Elves who want the universe to bathed in darkness again (like it used to be) and they have a weapon that can do it. However, thousands of years ago the Dark Elves were virtually wiped out in a giant battle. Surprise, they are back and ready to try and make the world dark again... which honestly doesn't sound too bad but apparently it also destroys everything in the process... I guess... it isn't really explained.As I have already mentioned, the Dark Elves are really sweet. Their technology is unique and menacing and the 'Kursed' infantry are totally BA! The designs of the Kursed were unique because CGI was mixed with legitimate animatronics and intricate costumes. Very nice to look at. The Asgardian tech is also expanded upon further in this movie, which at times makes the movie feel like Star Wars (but oh well). The movie's first three-fourths or so has really good action that is well thought out. The battles have scale, clever elements, and lots of violence. If there is one complaint that I would have is that both sides seem to enjoy killing people in gruesome ways a little too much. I know we are all used to violence, but at times it is hard to sympathize with the main characters when they are brutally murdering their enemies. Which leads to one of the movie's problems:I wish the villains would win.To me, everything about the Asgardian culture seems wrong. When Loki murders and kills hundreds if not thousands of humans they slap him on the wrist. When Thor killed thousands of ice dudes in the first movie they only slapped his wrist. Even Odin is portrayed as an arrogant jerk in this movie who literally says ""I am right because I win!"" These guys need to be defeated! I want them to lose! Thor does have a bit of a change of heart in this movie, but still, Asgard is corrupt and obnoxious.The human aspect of the movie is still dull, but not as bad as in the first movie. The action there obviously had some influence from the game Portal. A new character named Richard is randomly brought up and forgotten. For being a new love interest, it is strange that he is entirely forgotten in the movie's finale and ending. Which brings us to the movie's weaker element: the finale. Don't get me wrong, the finale has a wonderful set up and some great moments; however, very little is explained for why things are happening the way they do. Out of nowhere, it is revealed that *spoilers* these medal instruments used for identifying issues in time and space can be used as weapons... why? It was never really explained what they do or why they do anything so it is incredibly random and unfair when they are used. Other questions such as what happened to the ice beast that got brought in through the portal aren't explained. Why did the Dark Elf ship EXPLODE FOR NO FREAKING REASON!!! I'm not even joking! The Dark Elf ship just decided to blow up with no explanation! The movie established previously that it was full of what looked like possibly hundreds of Dark Elves. In the final battle we see maybe 50 (and they came down in a pod, not the main ship itself) so what happened to the rest of them in the ship? The ship just tips over and explodes even though it was clearly shown in the previous scenes that it had its engines on so it shouldn't tip over.The finale does have its moments with humour and good action, but so little is explained and so many random events happen that are never explained even after the finale has finished! It is chaotic and random! However, the portal element was well-done.All in all, Thor 2 has a much better premise and set-up than a lot of Marvel movies of late. It has the action, the villain, the acting, the emotion, and the visuals; however, the conclusion didn't seem fair. If a villain is to lose, then he better lose fairly. You can't ""cheat"" the audience into a victory, because then it just feels like a joke. The bad guy was obviously winning and was superior, but for no logical reason he just loses. Another minor gripe is that the Dark Elves probably could've just worn dark sunglasses or have found some sort of agreement of having their own dark sector. Their plan didn't seem logical, and sometimes their strength varied depending on what was needed for the plot. Their ships are like flying swords that can cut through buildings, but in another scene they tear apart like paper just with a sword. This is another case of the movie ""cheating"".I would give it a 7 or a 7.5. Can't wait for the sequel! Oh, and what about Light Elves? Those are in mythology as well :P",Thor - The Dark World

195,saytosandeep,MY REVIEW: Thor Lights Up Again!!,7,12 November 2013,"Thor is charismatic, ideal, no nonsense superhero as evident in his first outing played by Chris Hemsworth. In his awaited return after The Avengers, he takes the legacy further. His loved one is cool Jane Foster played beautifully by talented Natalie Portman. But the most lovable character remains his cunning, clever, cool, likable evil brother Loki played by Tom Hiddleston. In fact he is my second favorite villain after Joker of The Dark Knight in todays superhero universe. Visual effects vary from fantastic to excellent to mind-blowing. Stakes are much higher this time, but movie never tries to take them too seriously. In fact there are lot of funny situations and one liners but this fun was overdone in the messy climax. Nevertheless, it is a fun ride during which you would like to enjoy lots of popcorn. Please note that once movie is over, wait, there will a mid post credit scene to give you a clue for Avengers 2 and one at the very end showing the actual last scene of the movie.",Thor - The Dark World
196,overwatchgengi,The Worst MCU Film,4,23 July 2020,"Thor: The Dark World is a boring film that doesn't justify its existence as a movie. It offers hardly any insight into the characters and just acts as an unnecessary stepping stone in Marvel's chain of films ranging from Incredible to to bland. With no real care put into anything, and an even bigger focus on some of the annoying characters from the first Thor, there's not much reason to watch Thor: The Dark World.",Thor - The Dark World

198,kunalkhandwala,Technicality finds its happy medium with comic book storytelling,9,14 November 2013,"It has been 2 years since the New York incident and wars are raging all across the nine realms. Asgardian warriors have the onus of restoring order and warding off all evil. Meanwhile back on Earth, Jane Foster has accidentally unleashed an ancient weapon of the Dark Elves that resurrects their race, threatening the very existence of the Universe. The Norse God of Thunder has a mighty force to reckon with and will need the assistance of his deceitful brother Loki. Thor must prevent the world from falling into darkness before the imminent convergence of all realms. With most of the events unfolding upon Asgard, some fantastic special effects were obvious devices to be used by the celebrated TV director Alan Taylor whose most recent works include several memorable episodes of Game of Thrones, Mad Men & Sopranos. 'Thor: The Dark World' is undeniably an exciting superhero epic that outdoes its predecessor and establishes Chris Hemsworth as a worthy Avenger. While the Asgardians police the realms and keep trouble away from their homeland, Thor's ambivalence is highlighted. On one hand, he has a role in protecting Midgard as an Avenger and being closer to Jane Foster and on the other, the responsibility of being the King of Asgard in the near future. As Jane accidentally becomes the host for the dark power Aether on Earth, Thor decides to bring her to Asgard. Darkness then draws onto itself and the resurrected Malekith (Christopher Eccleston – Who?) attacks the might of Asgard itself causing terror and despair. Thor must now seek the assistance of whom he wouldn't trust at all but retribution, has common enemies. Together with Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor must prevent Malekith from unleashing darkness upon the world before the convergence of all nine realms occurs. The common plane of this rare alignment falls in Greenwich, which then serves as the final battleground for an epic clash between Thor and the forces of the Dark Elves. At his third outing as the God of Thunder, Chris Hemsworth is more convincing and iconic than ever before. He effectively manages distinct relationships in this sequel, between his father, his conniving brother and his love, Jane. With more humor, action and evil, Hemsworth does a mighty job with his hammer. Natalie Portman has a better role that is suited to her talent and at Asgard, she feels just at home as she was on Naboo as Queen Amidala. Anthony Hopkins might look weary of playing Old Odin but his voice and persona still make him the most suitable King. The show stealer however, is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. His comic timing and charm simply add to his character's dishonest nature. The untrustworthy Loki is turning out to be the most lovable villain and that simply asserts how well Hiddleston plays the part.Alan Taylor's comprehensive background with major TV series does enable him to blend in several elements of the story in a fast paced, eventful and exciting movie of less than 2 hours. A seemingly uncomplicated plot does yet provide the grip and thrill. With some exemplary visual effects that not only showcase the fantastic realm of Asgard in vivid light and colors but also showcase the epic destruction in Greenwich, Taylor makes remarkable use of technologies to enhance the story's appeal. The best part is, he directs the screenplay in a seamless manner that keeps the audience engaged with the pace so the film isn't heavily reliant on its visuals but is merely aided by it in its storytelling. That is precisely how such superhero movies should be made. The cinematography is excellent even with simple scenes such as Thor's arrival upon Earth, London's aerial view and the action on desolate landscapes of other realms. The background score has the epic tone and sustains the darkness associated with the film's evil. Technicality finds its happy medium with comic book storytelling and Taylor deserves credit for enhancing Thor's presence in the Marvel world. As Malekith's evil grows with the power of Aether, Thor's strength increases with his loved ones around him. His definitive stance for Midgard's well being and for his love, Jane Foster will establish him as an Avenger and protector of all realms. Meanwhile, Loki's wile ways shall keep us entertained with the brilliant Tom Hiddleston. Thor: The Dark World isn't ground-breaking but it does everything right for a superhero movie and that, is the simple reason you should spend that money. Oh, and to watch the scene where Thor sheds his cloak, jumps off the balcony, catches the incoming mjölnir and flies away. Epic.8.688 on a scale of 1-10.",Thor - The Dark World

200,fredschaefer-406-623204,"If you didn't like MAN OF STEEL or THE DARK KNIGHT, then this movie might be....",8,10 December 2013,"If you thought MAN OF STEEL or THE DARK KNIGHT movies were way too serious and earnest, then by all means go see THOR: THE DARK WORLD, which contains more than enough humor, action, and engaging characters to satisfy fans who get what comic books are all about.As a followup to THE AVENGERS, THE DARK WORLD hits it out of the park with epic characters, great special effects, and a plot that could be lifted straight from the best work of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. It comes in just under two hours, which makes some people complain that the movie felt rushed, is just about right for me.The first order of business for a superhero movie is to get the heroes right; and Chris Hemsworth does nothing if not improve upon his work in the first THOR film and THE AVENGERS. Thor this time around has learned from his experiences in battle and begun to think like a king.The second order of business for a superhero movie is to get the villain right. This time around the Big Bad is Malekith, the leader of the Dark Elves, who wants to wipe out the Asgardians and take the universe back the darkness before creation. He is one of those Marvel tropes: an ageless evil who lives for nothing but revenge. Played by Christopher Eccleston, he's all ugly and grim, while his right hand man is the Kurse, played by Abewale Akinnouye-Agbje, who played Mr. Echo on LOST. Their main weapon of mass destruction and the McGuffin of the story is the Aether, a WMB once hidden away by Thor's grandfather, but now discovered by Jane Foster, the Thunder God's main squeeze. While Malekith and the Kurse are pretty one dimensional, they are more than offset by the glorious return of Tom Hiddleston's Loki, imprisoned on Asgard after the events of THE AVENGERS. He offers his help to his half brother after grief makes them allies-at least for the moment; but we are never sure of his motives and that tension drives every scene Loki is in.The third order of business of a superhero movie is the special effects. And while THOR has plenty of CGI, it does not overwhelm the characters or the story. Certain aspects of the plot clearly were clearly lifted from scriptwriter's's template: there is a battle before the first third is done where the good guys have their butt's kicked and setting things up for a comeback at the climax. For at least the third time this year, we get to see a giant alien space ship lay waste to an Earth city. There's always the pertinent exposition shoehorned into the script, but at least it's not a drag on the story. Lot's of familiar faces are back this time around: Stellan Skarsgard is back as Dr. Selvig, his mind addled after his encounter with Loki in THE AVENGERS, while Kat Dennings's Darcy gets a boyfriend. Natalie Portman's Jane Foster is the perfect match for Hemsworth's Thor. Idris Elba, Ray Stevenson, Jamie Alexander, Tadanobu Asano, and Rene Russo are fellow Asgardians. Anthony Hopkins is grim and grumpy as Odin and following in the steps of Michael Caine and Richard Burton: talented British actors who really liked big paychecks and weren't particular how they earned them. Stan Lee gets his cameo and there's an amusing one by Chris Evans's Captain America. Somehow, Chris O'Dowd turn up as Jane's blind date.There's also a very pertinent cameo by an Academy Award winning actor in one of the after credit sequences; it's worth staying for and sets up the action for films yet to come.",Thor - The Dark World
201,achyutaghosh,Extremely enjoyable. Grandoise vision. Impeccable execution,9,9 November 2013,"I am a long time fan of comic books, and have really enjoyed Hollywood's current craze with them. Over the past few years, Marvel has reinvented large scale movie spectacles, infusing action and wit with science fiction and fantasy with great effectiveness, and earning top dollar for it. They have hit the bull's-eye again with Thor- The Dark World. As a sequel it belong to a hallowed club- it betters 2011's Thor in every conceivable way- better acting, better plot, better action and way better humor making for one thrilling experience.The story is standard superhero stuff- there is a catastrophic power. Dark forces once wielded it, good guys hid it, somehow it surfaces, dark forces want to reclaim it, and it is time again for the good guys to stand up again to ensure it does not happen. After a lengthy prologue that tell us about events that predates the creation of the universe as we know it, the movie picks up right after the New York invasion in the Avengers. Loki is in Asgard as a prisoner, and Thor and Jane Foster are united again, but only after Jane accidentally stumbles into another dimension and embodies an ancient dark power- the Aether. The dark elf Malekith wants to possess it to, well, turn all universe into darkness. After Asgard is invaded, and the only thing that both Thor and Loki loved is taken away from them, an uneasy alliance between the two remains the only thing that can stop the destruction of the universe. All in all, a premise that requires a lot of popcorn to digest.""I wish i could trust you""- Thor ""Trust my rage""- LokiShoehorning Norse mythology into science fiction is a crazy idea, right? But what execution here. The production values are impeccable, kind of leave The Avengers far behind, even though extensively shot in Marvel's version of Asgard which is an imaginative living, breathing world. Game of Thrones director Alan Taylor is at the helm here, and the mega bucks at his disposal come off strongly. The pace is snappy, there is never a dull moment due to frequent action and the infectious humor- Kat Dennings, Chris O'Dowd, Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skaarsgaard gets guffaw inducing lines. This is as much Liam Hemsworth's movie as it is Tom Hiddlestons'. If Thor is called as the witless oaf who would punch his way out of a situation, Loki is irresistible as the snarky, duplicitous, conflicted, whimsical trickster, an anti-hero that today's Breaking Bad generation would love to bits. Loki shifts from black to white to grey, and grey is what he will remain in the Marvel universe henceforth- choosing sides that benefit him. And in between comes in Chris Evans in a scene stealing cameo as Captain America lampooning himself (""I can feel the righteousness flowing through me!"")It is true that we in India do not have a comic book culture, and the lack of quality source material is evident. A week back we had Krrish 3, which was ambitious no doubt but came out horribly clichéd. Thor-The Dark World is a 2 hour lesson for Rajesh Roshan on how to tell a wacky story that actually captivates the audience. It is goofy, has numerous plot holes but by God i had a great time watching it. Dazzling action, tons of humor (this is the third time i have mentioned the word in the review, i know!), charismatic actors and likable characters- this is the Marvel billion dollar formula and it is at full display here, audiences rejoice. Definitely recommended- 9/10",Thor - The Dark World
202,Come-and-Review,Not that bad...,5,24 March 2015,"This is again like the previous chapter too downrated. Want to remind that more than a superhero movie, The dark world seems a space-fantasy movie. This movie has much action, though I somehow managed to get bored at the end. The fact is that, just as Guardians of the galaxy, marvel space sci-fi overuses energy flares, beams and such... and that at the very end gets kinda annoying to me. Still, Thor: the dark world has enough humor, story, and good plot/action to overlook at this slight problem... I want to note down that toward the beginning we have a series of events that reminds deeply of the phenomenas described in the novel 'Roadside picnic' of the strugackij brothers, the original story that inspired Tarkovskij's eternal sci-fi classic, Stalker; therefore I really appreciated that maybe unwanted reference. Score is different than the first one, and I didn't like it that much. Overall, I liked the movie, not so much like other stuff, this is not at all a deep science fiction.",Thor - The Dark World
203,jace_the_film_guy,Boring and Clunky,3,16 July 2021,"Boring and clunky. I finished most of the other MCU films in one sitting or two, but Thor: The Dark World took four days to finish. I could not help but keep falling asleep. The film is just plain boring. The villain is forgettable (going in I really could not remember this villain or his value), the significance of the convergence was too complicated to be fully explained and the pacing dragged. It does have a fantastic score, but that is one of the few positives. The best moment of the film was the final scene with Loki on the throne. Other than that, the rest of Thor: The Dark World was dark and moody. I honestly do not think I will ever go back and watch unless it's during a marathon rewatch of the MCU.",Thor - The Dark World
204,mjb301086,On par with the first,7,23 July 2021,Don't really get all the hate for this one. It's definitely low tier Marvel but not the worst Marvel film.,Thor - The Dark World
205,Mike-DD,Beautiful photography,9,15 March 2014,"Since the first film was based mostly on Earth, we never got to explore Asgard. Well, we get to do that here, and Asgard is breathtakingly beautiful. Looking in part like an ancient city, you get lost in the imagery especially during the battle scenes. The photography is done so beautifully you do not feel jarred seeing futuristic fighters amidst ancient-looking buildings and longboats that fly and shoot lasers. And the various panoramic scenes of a spaceship in the middle of London were well-done too.The fight scenes could have been choreographed better though - at times, I wondered why a technologically advanced race was still fighting with swords and shields while wearing non-functional capes when their defence systems shoot lasers and put up force fields. Asgard is supposed to be the ruling realm but its soldiers fight with swords and shields against laser guns and mini black holes? I'm also surprised its fortress is so easily overpowered - you'd have expected even stone walls and columns in Asgard to have a greater degree of resilience. If the fight scenes were better choreographed, I'd most likely be awed enough to enjoy them rather than think about them.I'm glad to see Heimdall having an expanded role in this film. I did not read the comics, so I was intrigued by the power and responsibility wielded by him, being supposedly able to even deny the King of Asgard entry into his realm. It's great to see him doing much more in this film other than guarding the Bifrost like in the last movie.Loki's banter is delightfully enjoyable as usual. And I especially enjoyed the short scene where he was changing his and Thor's forms so as to be ""less conspicuous"". Apart from the visuals, the story was engaging enough. The plot moves fast, keeping one engaged and interested till the end of the film. Some cheesy lines at the end of the film, but they were to be expected. All in all, a very pretty picture-story backed by a credible plot.",Thor - The Dark World
206,Spartan_1_1_7,A highly entertaining ride.,8,10 February 2014,"Another hit by Marvel and with Captain America: The Winter Soldier looking awesome so far, Marvel The Avengers Phase two is looking pretty good. This was an improvement from Thor 1 in almost every way. The story was your typical Superhero story but it was executed properly which made for a great viewing. The Marvel humor is also present thoroughly in this movie. They timed it rightly and it even made me laugh out loud during some moments. There were also nods to the Avengers universe here and there, which makes these movies all the more fun as it is all connected and what not. Marvel has certainly hit a Jackpot ever since they decided to do this from 2008.Almost all the cast from Thor 1 was back, which was good too see. Chris Hemsworth delivered a great performance as Thor yet again. His character development is good and you can see how much he has changed since Thor 1. BUT I'll have to say, the star of the show is LOKI. He just nails it every time he is on screen. Tom Hiddleston as Loki is probably one of the best casting decision ever. He is one of my favourite character of this Marvel Avengers universe. And the WTF/Awesome ending of this movie just made the wait to see him again a lot harder. The side characters are good too, whether it is for comic relief or other stuff. Mainly Darcy, she is funny and its good they kept her. The action sequences were really good and very entertaining. The CGI was nice and much improved from Thor 1. There was a lot more action too this time, and rightly paced too, which made the movie an entertaining experience through and through. As it is common with Marvel movies, be sure to check out the two after credits scene. I can't wait for Captain America: The winter soldier now. Must watch for any fan of the Marvel movies. 8.2/10",Thor - The Dark World
207,iguth,Better than you'd think,7,28 April 2019,"Known across the Marvel fan base as the worst of the MCU films much of the time, it gets too much hate. When it comes to a stand alone Thor sequel, I really could not have expected anything different. This sadly means that it is quite forgettable but even so, it is a Thor movie. Dark World focuses mainly on Thor, and Thor. The supporting cast is there but much less important than anything Thor does to progress the plot (the plot on Earth has no effect on the story). Even though this movie is a progression of the Thor series, it still manages to provide no development of the mentality of Thor, or Loki, or even Odin. This movie seems to me as a good way for Marvel to accomplish things that set up other movies now, The Aether, deaths, etc.",Thor - The Dark World
208,michaelhirakida,"The Worst Film Of The Year. Loud, Obnoxious and All Over The Place.",2,8 November 2013,"Go ahead and find this review not useful. But listen to me. I love Marvel films. The Original Spider-man Trilogy was amazing and The Avengers was awesome. But when I saw Iron Man 3 I was bored out of my mind and I felt it was not good. So I lowered my expectations for this movie and hoped it would be better right? Because from what I learned, the lower the expectations, the better the movie. Big Mistake.Thor The Dark World is all over the map with scenes of badly choreographed action scenes to bad comedy to laughable acting.I really wanted to like this film because I liked the original Thor. It was really good and it was directed by Kenneth B. who is the man who made The best adaptation of Hamlet Ever. But the movie suffers from production troubles to a bad script.The Film begins with this super magic thing called the Ether... I think which causes destruction. They find it and this one guy says ""Lets Destroy it."" but this other guy says ""ITS TOO POWERFUL! We must put it in a place where it is easily touchable!"" I knew this was going to be a bad film because the beginning suffers from cliché after cliché.Thor returns to Earth because Jane gets the Ether in her and they must heal her. The Dark Elves who are the bad guys for the film attack Thor's planet and the main baddie tries to line up the main 9 planets and cause darkness everywhere. Thor gets Loki from Prison and they go stop the evil baddie.The script and direction are extremely weak. The script sucks because the dialogue is horrendous. The acting is hilarious from Anthony Hopkins as Odin as he overacts a lot in this movie.The action scenes are poorly choreographed and make no sense.Also, Heroes should have weaknesses. Thor nearly throughout the whole Has none. Why should we care if they are unstoppable without any weaknesses, that takes away the credibility of the character.Also, this teleporting plot line makes no sense. They go nearly everywhere in this movie. In the final fight scene fall everywhere going back from place to place. They never explain why these teleports are randomly put all over the map but it really annoys me.The jokes... oh my god. They are so unfunny. Who cares if the Professor guy's pants are not on? Bad comedy has to be understood and this movie doesn't understand comedy. The character of Darcy is obnoxious. She was alright in the first but she always has to say HOLY SH*T 500 times a scene.The special effects are alright but its not always about the effects. One effect actually hurt my eyes and I didn't know if it was the 3D or if my eyes just hurt.There are very few good things about this movie. The guy who plays Loki is one of the only redeeming qualities of this movie and he is very convincing. The Stan Lee Cameo is also great and funny like always. There is a awesome twist I wont spoil. But that's about it.This movie is just super loud in its bad action scenes are poor acting and ear bleeding sound effects.Thor The Dark World is the worst movie of the year without a doubt. I was disappointed severely. Marvel can be much better then this and I hope Captain America The Winter Soldier does a better job at being a better superhero movie.25/100 D",Thor - The Dark World
209,grumpy-3,even better than the first one,9,29 October 2013,"Saw Thor Dark World yesterday, and by golly it was a hoot, good to see a comic adaptation that is not up its own arse as the last two Batman films were, lots of humour, great action, and really good to look at. again the 3d conversion was pointless, they really should stop doing this to get extra bucks, but there you go. The cast are all perfect all playing straight but also loose. I was worried when the title included the word Dark, used also for Star Trek into Darkness, but thankfully it relates literally to the Dark planet and the baddie who wants to turn the Universe from light to Dark. the humour was even better than in Avengers, and the cross referencing with the Marvel universe and characters was perfect, looking forward to seeing it again this time in 2d if i can find a cinemas that will be playing it on a large screen if not will wait for the DVD",Thor - The Dark World
210,destinylives52,Good Sequel,7,21 January 2018,"The second of the Thor movies, ""Thor: The Dark World"" has the Universe threatened by an evil, elf ruler who wants to use something called the Aether (a powerful, energy source). As Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth) goes from one world to the next to quell wars, as well as sulk because he misses his girlfriend (Natalie Portman), the evil guy and his evil henchmen are on the march to retrieve the Aether and bring destruction to every world he can reach. Why? Because he's evil.Hemsworth has a plan to destroy the evil elf dude, but it goes against his father's wishes. Hemsworth decides to do it anyway with the help of his ""brother"" Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and a few Earthlings who are in way over their heads. The plan is risky, and failure means the deaths of gazillions of creatures in many worlds.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Thor: The Dark World"" is the scene when ** SPOILER ALERT ** Hiddleston is told that his adopted mother has been killed in combat by the evil elf ruler. Quiet and calm at first, Hiddleston suddenly destroys his room with his magic. Earlier in the movie, Hiddleston uttered harsh words toward his adopted mother.""Thor: The Dark World"" was more fun than I thought it would be. The action sequences were very good, as expected; but the dialogue and how the main characters interacted with each other were done very well, which has become the trademark of Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. Despite the alluring special effects and thrilling action scenes, the characters are the ones we truly connect to.--Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",Thor - The Dark World
211,caseynicholson,Enjoyable! But Not as Good as Its Predecessor,8,22 April 2015,"Let me begin by saying that I'm writing this review as part of my Marvel Cinematic Universe review series as I'm watching all ten of the MCU films in preparation for ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" which is set to come out in a couple of weeks. That being the case, I was excited to watch ""Thor: The Dark World"" because of the fact that my memory of this movie was that I enjoyed it a lot more than I did the original ""Thor"" movie based on my experience of seeing each of the films in theaters upon their original release. When I watched the first ""Thor"" for this review series, I found that it had really grown on me. So ""The Dark World"" surely would grow on me too, right?Sadly, I found that the second installment in the Thunder God's franchise was not as much of an improvement over its origin story as I recalled. Whereas the first ""Thor"" gained ground in my estimation, ""The Dark World"" came across a bit weaker than when I saw it in the theater.Before moving on, let me quickly say that I nevertheless do like the film, and find it to be a strong movie overall. You'll see that I've given it 8/10 stars. I had given the first ""Thor"" 9/10 in this review series, so ""The Dark World"" is just barely less enjoyable based on those rankings.That said, Thor 2 has its ups and downs. On the positive side of things, I really enjoyed the basic plot of this movie. We get to see Thor going back and forth between Asgard and Earth, just as we did in the first film. The relationship between Thor and Jane Foster is developed, Loki, Odin and the other Asgardians play crucial roles, and the time spent on Earth is much better used than in the first film. I found the Earth scenes in the first film to be a bit contrived, and almost came across as sort of an archetype of the standard ""extra-terrestrials come to Earth and causes havoc"" type of storyline. In Thor 2, the Earth scenes are much more developed, with the film's final Earth battle proving to be a robust climax of the film.Where the film suffers, however, is its poor character development for its main antagonists. This stands out since said characters play such a critical part in the film, and also because they are basically the only significant new character additions in the film at all, as most of the characters have been carried over from the first movie. As such, it's easy to keep up with Thor, Jane, Loki, Odin, etc. But the villains have very little back story, and very little in terms of developing their characters as the plot moves along. None of this is to say that you won't be able to keep up or follow the storyline--it's simply to say that the storyline will seem a bit trivial because the villains are at one and the same time underdeveloped and yet also portrayed to be egregiously evil. That kind of lack of character development makes the story seem a bit hollow, in spite of the fact that it's nevertheless a strong plot overall.All that said, I would again give the film 8/10 stars. This is another strong showing for the MCU, and a great film that is fun for anyone who is into the comic book genre of movies. It's also significant in that it foreshadows the already announced ""Infinity War"" direction that the MCU is headed in by showcasing one of the Infinity Stones, the Aether as a major part of the storyline. In summary, ""The Dark World"" falls short of perfection, but it's nevertheless fun and entertaining overall, and significant in the larger narrative of the MCU.",Thor - The Dark World

It even managed to keep too much silliness from happening in the romance department, which was a bonus.Great special effects, loved the new angel of old mythology meets technology, meets other worlds, meets star wars, meets flaky human existence.

Firstly we have Thor: A completely uninteresting character played by someone without any skills whatsoever. Secondly it is a world with space ships, where all soldiers has clubs, axes and swords. Duh? Thirdly? well, the story is completely uninteresting and hard to follow.

215,craig-hopton,"Less Thor, more Loki please!",7,5 November 2015,"I preferred this to the first Thor movie. It is predominantly set in the lands of the gods rather than on Earth -which means more scope for SciFi/magical cityscapes, weird spaceships and bad guys.Thor himself, played by Chris Hemsworth, is actually a bit dull. In the first movie he goes through a character development from an insolent young adult to a responsible king-in- waiting. In The Dark World he's just regal, sensible and boring.But don't dismay! The character of Loki is developed very nicely in this movie and he steals the show. Loki is the double- crossing trickster of the gods and much more interesting than the one-dimensional characters surrounding him. Tom Hiddleston is well-cast in this role.The bad guys, the Dark Elves, are excellent too. They're truly frightening creatures (for a 12-rated film). Full marks to the make-up artists I think. There's some great battle scenes between the Dark Elves and the Asgardians.All in all this isn't a masterpiece but it's entertaining viewing throughout.(And it's surely just a matter of time before a Loki spin-off movie comes our way!)",Thor - The Dark World

219,JPfanatic93,"A movie is only as good as its bad guy, but Loki isn't the main villain here",7,16 November 2013,"The Odinson returns in his second solo venture, more grandiose than the last, but still very close in narrative make-up to its predecessor, despite a change of director. Kenneth Branagh declined the offer to helm this second installment while female director Patty Jenkins was fired early on, at which point Game of Thrones director Alan Taylor took over the reins, and quite successfully so. The Shakespearean overtones are nevertheless kept in, only enlarged by his Martinian experience with grand halls, epic battles and conniving siblings, all too similar in nature to the subject matter so far. After leaving the Avengers and returning home with his captive brother Loki, Thor (Chris Hemsworth more beefed up than ever) has been kept busy for two years fighting rampaging marauders and other dangers to cosmic stability across the Nine Realms. Meanwhile, his human love Jane (Natalie Portman) also hasn't taken time off in search for her divine boytoy by using every scientific means at her disposal. On investigation in Britain, she stumbles upon a portal to another place where she is infected by the Aether, a dangerous, ancient material that is the key energy source of the largely extinct Dark Elves that once battled the Asgardians for dominance in times immemorial, and lost. Sensing the Aether has awoken, the few remaining members of this shadowy race prepare for another shot at universal power grabbing under the leadership of the wrathful Malekith (Christopher Eccleston wearing creepy make-up). When they unexpectedly assault Asgard and kill Thor's mother, the distraught wielder of the powerful hammer Mjölnir disobeys his heavenly father's commands and recruits his untrustworthy brother Loki (an impeccable Tom Hiddleston, again playing the trickster god with the usual vigour that makes him the most fascinating Marvel villain of them all) to defeat the Dark Elves before their nefarious plans for Jane and the universe are brought to their catastrophic conclusion. The only bond that shares them at this point in their overly tumultuous relationship is the mutual love for their mother's memory: otherwise there is no trust or love lost between them. Will Thor manage to save his girlfriend and everything else, without ending with a knife in his back at the hands of his seemingly imbalanced brother, or crushed by the ever stronger Malekith? It will remain to be seen during a bombastic battle in the British capital (instead of set in the States, as has been usual in Marvel movies thus far).The problem audiences might have with Thor: The Dark World is the fact it doesn't dare to leave its established comfort zone and therefore sticks suspiciously close to what we have already seen in the previous film. Though Thor's cosmic portion of the Marvel Universe is certainly expanded in terms of scope and story, thematically speaking there's little to be found that feels new. The nature of heroism, the love for a mortal woman, the rivalry between brothers: it has all been done before, but at least The Dark World doesn't do it badly. In terms of style Asgard has never looked so glorious to behold: a sharp contrast to the dreadful dead soil of the barren world of Svartalfheim that had to be conquered and annihilated for the Norse gods to rise to power – which makes you rethink how much of 'the good guys' they really claim to be – as we are told in a fabulous prologue that feels a lot like the opening of a certain Peter Jackson fantasy blockbuster. Apart from the many predictable but entertaining scenes of supernatural action The Dark World provides, also ever present is the level of humour that reminds us we ought not to take any of this too seriously, as well as keeping us from forgetting we're watching a comic book adaptation. Key in this is a reversal of the dynamics between Jane and Thor seen previously, where he was cast out of his world in order to come to terms with a ""lesser state"" of existence for his own good. This time it's Jane's turn to be a stranger in a strange land as she's swept to Asgard where her Earthly unsophisticatedness causes many a merry moment: not because she's overwhelmed by it all, but due to her impulse to make scientific sense of her new environment, which startles the Asgardian natives somewhat. Those who hoped for more Asgardian style dialogue, as present in the comics, will find themselves disappointed though, as the gods unfortunately speak as much of a contemporary language as our own. Thor and Jane make a decent on-screen couple, but it's the supporting cast that succeeds the most in keeping us engaged, with Hiddleston worthy of most praise. It is often said a movie is only as good as its bad guy, which should have made The Dark World a very good movie, but Loki is forced by the plot to be submissive in terms of villainy to Malekith, despite the fact Loki far exceeds this new villain in being interesting (no criticism on Eccleston's performance it must be stated), mostly thanks to his almost heartfelt loss of his mother, which for a moment makes you think he genuinely wants to help Thor in exacting revenge. And by pulling that off convincingly, Hiddleston again reveals why he was such a good choice for this lovable rogue. Dark or not, it's Loki's world, and we would do well never to underestimate him as everyone else does.And be sure to stick with the credits a while longer to witness a largely unrelated but nevertheless hugely intriguing typical Marvel 'bridge' to next year's Guardians of the Galaxy, which will expand the cosmic corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe even further. It stars Benicio Del Toro with a funny accent and a silly hairdo, so you have no valid reason to miss out on it, really.",Thor - The Dark World

221,tinovalkki,Great comic book adaption,9,2 November 2013,"Thor: The Dark World is a great superhero movie which combines elements from fantasy and scifi movies. There is enough surprise moment and humor to keep it ongoing and sustainable. Movie lends shameless elements from Star Wars and Lord of The Rings movies and combines them together to an original adventure. Movie looks and sounds beautiful. Bouncing between different dimensions could easily be confusing but director Alan Taylor keeps them tightly together. Even the length of the movie is suitable, less than two hours, which is great remittance despite all the action and scenery. That ensures that you won't get bored and movie rumbles through it's duration like fast train. Balance between humor and drama is great in spite of some murky moments. It is good to see that Marvel takes good care it's movies and combines finely different productions. That ensures nice comic feeling in their movies. Unquestionably Thor: The Dark world is Marvel's elite in these comic book adaptions. The end of the movie promises more sequels for this sledge hammer hero. I just hope they have more courage to bring elements from Asgard mythology in upcoming sequels. That would make this even more enjoyable movie experience.

222,IndustriousAngel,"Very comic-book like, but with little emotional impact",6,8 November 2013,"It is more fun than the first Thor, but also a bit more unfocused, not really knowing what it's aiming for. It feels way more comic-y, a good thing in a comic book movie I think - very colourful, strong images, and so on - though it goes a bit high on silliness during the endfight when the earth-worms jizz them POWERS all across the nine worlds and back again.One thing I didn't understand - why did the screenwriters raise the stakes like they did? Obviously they wanted a funnier adventure this time, and there's some really nice laughs and even slapstick - so why not a ""smaller"" plot? I never had the impression that the future of the universe was at stake, but if we have to believe Odin and the scientists - it was. Never felt that way. There's a point where it's a matter of seconds if the universe will cease to exist, and Thor coyly travels by Subway to the epicenter of events (after politely asking for directions, of course) - that's very funny and silly but completely stops the action and takes away much impact.And, come on - where was the romance? There was more emotion between Thor and Loki than between Thor and Jane. It worked in Thor1 (kind of) so why not here? Where were the sparks flying between Sif and Jane?What I really did like was Loki, it was always one of the strengths of the Marvel comics that their villains could (and sometimes would) be heroes in a different situation. Hiddleston really steals the show. Other highlights: The spaceship designs and most costumes.Overall: An entertaining and fun movie that takes itself less serious than necessary and suffers from an uneven tone in the way ""The Fifth Element"" did - if you liked that one, you'll be OK with Thor2, too!",Thor - The Dark World

This will ensure the nine realms live happily ever after, under the benign rule of ""Odin"" (Anthony Hopkins) and his much loved wife Frigga (Rene Russo).Meanwhile in an ancient flashback we get acquainted with Aether, a very dark power the Dark Elve warriors ""Kursed"", led by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) are keen to get their hands on. They are frustrated in this endeavour by the armies of Asgard, led by ""Bor"", Odin's father from many thousands of years ago.Back on Earth, Astrophysicist ""Jane"" (Natalie Portman) is led by her intern ""Darcy"" (Kat Dennings), equipped with her own PA, to an abandoned warehouse where objects appear to act oddly, disappearing to another dimension when dropped from a staircase.Separating from the group, Jane is suddenly teleported to another realm as you do and becomes possessed by the ancient super weapon Aether, an easy mistake to make whilst out taking a stroll.Concerned for Jane's safety, after being alerted to her plight by Fandral (Idris Elba), Thor brings Jane to Asgard. It is obvious her presence in Asgard is dangerous, as it lures the Kursed like a moth to the light, or darkness to the Aether. Following events, Thor is obliged to trust Loki and Fandral to find a way to leave Asgard against his fathers wishes, leading to an attempt to trick Melkith and destroy the Aether.Can Loki be trusted, is the fate of the world's safe, will the foretold alignment of all nine realms lead to a cataclysmic event, all good comic book questions to answer.The film is an obvious upgrade from the original film with a budget to match, Hemsworth and Hiddleston play their parts with consummate ease and obvious glee. Hemsworth retaining his almost Shakespearean style of delivery, which remains a source of amusement to the audience but is largely accepted by the earth bound characters. Both lead actors star wattage is much higher than before and clearly are enjoying every scene and one-liner. It is now difficult to imagine either part being played by other actors.As before, the film seemingly represents a hybrid of earlier movies, stealing like a hyperactive magpie from new Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. Occasionally the slim story and movie Macguffin (Aether) is exposed and the film skirts close to Game of Thrones (GOT) without the sex and gore. All huge throne rooms, fabulous cities and dark portentous events hanging over proceedings. Director Alan Taylor, previously directed 6 GOT episodes which may explain the similarities.However, if you treat the film as pure entertainment, as you should, there is much fun to be had. Buoyed by the lead actors having a blast and not taking themselves too seriously. However Hopkins looks somewhat uncomfortable, perhaps not getting the ""do not take this too seriously memo"" and Rene Russo gets little to do. However gate keeper Elba, obviously a much bigger star than before, gets his role beefed up accordingly.Back on earth, Stellan Skarsgard as a scientist helping Jane, gets ready for his ""Nymphomaniac"" Lars Von Triers directed role, by spending much of the time in a state of undress or in an institution, presumably the pay was good. Portman, understandably performing heroine in distress duties most of the time still manages to be attractive, strong and vulnerable as required. We also get a brief cameo from Chris O'Dowd as Jane's prospective boyfriend post Thor, good luck with that endeavour.There is plenty of humour to puncture the preposterousness of a man/god with a big hammer smashing stuff up, which is almost a pre-requisite in our post-modern, self referential movie world.Watch out for two post credit sequences, a neat cameo and of course Stan Lee, all now well established Marvel studio trademarks.Summary A different, better and more confident film than the original and continues to expand the Thor universe in an interesting way.Hemsworth and Hiddleston are on fine form, if you like comic book superhero films with state of the art effects and enjoyable characters, this will do very nicely.",Thor - The Dark World
225,Morejambo54,Bland and forgettable but has its qualities.,4,14 April 2021,"The movie is all over the place. Possibly the worst pacing of any movie I've ever scene, with random scenes that slow down the film while not actually having a purpose of being there. Some of the characters have been improved upon since the first thor film while others have had a major downgrade. Thor, I believe, had an upgrade, he is much more likeable in this movie and continues to make the right choice and shows how his character has developed since the fist film. Loki was probably the biggest disappointment, he really played no role in this movie and was just thrown in at stupid points in the story. Loki also had an unnecessary amount of comedic lines which really does not fit his character at all, especially in a movie like this. Jane Foster was awful. The dark elves were awful. The scientist guy that runs around naked was awful. Even the mothers death was awful. The soundtrack for the movie was good though...yeah. Not marvels finest work.",Thor - The Dark World
226,haydenluz,Thor: The Dark World,3,23 January 2021,"Thor: The Dark World, directed by Alan Taylor, is another one of those MCU films where it's take it or leave it; If you enjoy Thor, and the different worlds aspect, you will enjoy this film, if you don't particularly care for it, you're most likely not going to like this film. I always try to give the Thor films the benefit of the doubt, due to it's hard to sculpt premise, but The Dark World wasn't one of those films that needed to be made. Even though Alan Taylor handled most of the aspects better than the first Thor, while somewhat keeping the continuity alive, The Dark World is just utterly forgettable, and almost disposable. Taylor set up a few decent expositions, but due to the fast pace, nothing carried through, becoming underdeveloped, and thrown away, with the tones being here, there, and everywhere.Taylor did his best by trying to give everyone more to do, but everyone was just so bland! Our returning protagonist do the best with what they're given, but all of the side characters, especially the human side characters, are just throw away. The creative team spent no time building anyone up besides our three leads in Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, and Tom Hiddleston. Chris Hemsworth returns once again as Thor, but there wasn't much added to his character. The writers spent too much time on trying to force the relationship between him and Natalie Portman, that ended up diminishing some of Thor's best qualities, to a certain extent. On the flip side, his relationship with Loki is captured great, being the best parts of the film. I wish I could say that Hemsworth carried the film, but he, himself said that he wasn't too crazy on it. Natalie Portman returns as Jane, just to take up time and space. The writers tried to make her a key piece to the narrative, but it did not pay off at all. I feel bad for Portman, because she's a very good actress; she just can't catch a break with these writers, writting her character. Tom Hiddleston returns as Loki, but he is questionably sidelined for most of the first half of the film, not having much to do at all. Even though I wasn't fond of him being put off to the side for the majority of the film, the writers gave him a nice grounded side to his character, while making a great impact to the film. The biggest issue I had with Malekith is, if you're going to have a great villain like Loki in the film before, you need to at least match the power, or out-do him, and Malekith is a flat out, laughable villain. His super underdeveloped motive is tremendously outplayed already. Christopher Eccleston tries way too hard to be a good villain, but he poses such a small threat, while just not fitting the scheme for Thor, or the MCU at that. Kurse on the other hand, definitely had the potential to be a decent villain, that poses and actual threat, but he was nothing but a disposable side character.The screenplay by Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, Robert Rodat, Don Payne & Christopher Yost, was the biggest downfall of the film. Most of their dialogue and jokes were forceful and bland, while they couldn't seem to find a tone to stick to.One of the best aspects of the film, was the action, backed up by the film wonderful effects. Out of all of the films so far, besides Marvel's: The Avengers, the action has been there, but not one of the highest points of the films; here, it's one of the main focuses, paying off pretty well by cutting down some dialogue scenes that could've been created.Overall, I came in HATING this film, but left somewhat enjoying it, and now seeing it just SLIGHTLY better than the first.",Thor - The Dark World
227,domtaylor,The worst film in the MCU.,5,12 July 2018,"The sequel to what was the worst film in the MCU managed to achieve something: it stole that title from it's predecessor. Despite a hokey narration that sets up the plot, 'Thor: The Dark World' starts off promisingly with a good action sequence and re-introduction to Asgard, but it soon becomes clear that the film is aimless. Far too much time is spent with the uninteresting 'Earth characters', and the pacing is terrible. Even when the action finally begins, it's boring. Sure, the special effects look good, but we don't care about them because we don't care about the characters. On top of that, the film has what is probably the worst villain of the entire MCU and it has horrible cinematography. At least it has a better handle of tone than the first and the camera is held straight. Plus, it's watchable enough and stands on its own two wobbly legs without setting up further films. 5/10",Thor - The Dark World
228,bravesfanc,Better than its predecessor,7,14 November 2013,"I enjoyed the first movie but after watching it thought to myself, ""well that wasn't bad, but I wouldn't watch it again"". The sequel however, I would watch again. Maybe it's because all these movies that have come after the Avengers are all tied together even more. Regardless, it was a fun movie with plenty of action and humor to go around.But like most people, I would agree that ""Loki"" is by far the best part of this movie. The acting was fantastic and you get more interested every time he's on screen. The rest of the cast also does a good job as to not take this too seriously but serious enough not to make it laughable.As always, stay past the credits for an extra scene. Although I didn't get it, after reading what it meant online, it seems Marvel have very big plans for their characters. This sequel was better than the first so if you liked the first one, you will definitely like this one.",Thor - The Dark World
229,rcolgan,"Enjoyable, but flawed",5,22 August 2014,"Thor Dark World starts two years after the events of 'The Avengers' as a great evil known as the darkness possesses Thors girlfriend Jane Foster (what a random coincidence!). Thus Thor must save her and the rest of the world from dark elves who seek to use the darkness to destroy the universe. The stakes are supposedly higher, but it never feels that way. Even in the final fight then it never feels like Thor is ever in any real peril. The dark elves just never appear as that much of a challenge in the film. Not only do they not pose a threat but they never appear as interesting characters either, even the leader of the Dark Elves Malketh doesn't get much attention. Whilst Ecclestons performance is impressive and the makeup design is interesting, the villain doesn't get any background. Malekth's sole motivation in the film is to destroy the universe. Why? Because he is evil! At least that's all we really get from him. Largely because the dark elves don't get that much screen time. More time seems to get put towards bringing back the fan favourite Loki to the film.This could be good if he were written in properly. But the problem is that he isn't. Loki was only written in after the success of the Avengers and doesn't really have any role to play. They try to justify his inclusion in the plot at times, but the truth is he is there for fan appeal alone. He's the kind of character who you could remove all of his scenes from the film and you'd still get a complete story regardless. Saying this, Loki does still have many enjoyable moments. He still has the same memorable wit people loved from the Avengers and Hiddelston does have quite a few scene stealing moments. Thor is still an enjoyable hero in this one. Though his story isn't as interesting. In the first we got to see his transition from a reckless soldier to a noble warrior to gain the worthiness of his hammer Monjir. But here he doesn't really progress at all. But for what he has to work with Hemsworth gives a good performance once again as the Norse god of thunder. His presence alone is one of great power and his delivery does make for some hilarious moments. On the downside many of the action scenes in the film are pretty forgettable. Largely because most of them don't feel particularly well choreographed. Most of the earlier fight scenes try to look like a big epic battle scene, but they never really feel that way. They'll always be in some interesting backdrops ranging from fantasy cities like Asgard to the populated city of London. But they will usually lack any real sense of excitement that we expect from the Marvel universe. Luckily the final fight does make up for this with a fight between Malketh and Thor stretching across several worlds. It makes little sense with the teleporting between worlds lacking any real sense of cohesive logic. But it still makes for both some cool visuals and funny moments.Out of the entirety of Marvel Phase 2, this is the weakest outing. It doesn't add anything original that we haven't already seen from the marvel franchise. In the end it's really nothing more than mindless action with a little bit of comedy thrown in. If that's all you want from a marvel film you might enjoy it. But if you're expecting the same charm and heroics of the rest of the marvel universe then you'll likely get let down.",Thor - The Dark World
230,fredberglyle,THOR is powerless at the dark world,5,13 April 2014,"Okay, so another Marvel comic flick. The sequel of 2011 Thor movie and the avengers. Would serve as a prequel to next Avengers movie. A super-hero movie about the demi-god, his brother Loki, his father Odin and the Asgardians. And yes, the audience get to see Jane (played by Portman), doctor Selvig and friends from London. The movie contains lot of special effects that are good esp. the fight scene at the climax. Loki was better among the main characters in this movie, while others here are bad. The villain Kurse was cool. All the other characters are so much under-developed and superficial. The script could've been way better. The teleport scene was a disappointment. Except for CGI, I disliked the entire movie. Still watchable just once, if you are a die-hard marvel comic fan.",Thor - The Dark World
231,MovieProductions,Thor: The Lackluster World,5,22 December 2013,"** out of **** While the first Thor generally received favorable reviews, it wasn't exactly met with acclaim. But I liked it a lot more than I had anticipated, so I thought lightning would strike twice (pun- intended), especially since this time around, reviews weren't too striking (pun-intended) for ""The Dark World"". With my logic, the reviews would REALLY not subside my experience of the film. Well... they were spot-on. The top critics that is. I'm not going to re-tell the synopsis for you. It's Thor. It's the sequel. There's a comic book to it and when you read a review for a blockbuster sequel, you just want to know the simple answer to a very simple question: Is the movie good? No... but let's not get too carried away with the fact it's not great, because it's not bad. So where does the problem lie?Well for starters, this movie was underwhelming as hell. With so many twists and turns, and changes in character motifs, you'd think the film would be very emotionally enveloping. But it just feels so dry, because the pacing is too abrupt to let you soak in the material. And characters just pop in and out of places, without a sense of cohesion or above-average scriptwriting. The first to me really nailed the chemistries between characters, but this one didn't make me care for anyone with the exception of- you guessed it- Thor. I found Darcy to actually be borderline obnoxious here, and Jane was just... Natalie Portman. Even Anthony Hopkins felt underused with his character.I understand being a sequel, you want to rush to the big action set pieces and show off every penny you've spent on graphics/effects, but what made the first Thor so great is while it was visually pleasing, it connected to its viewers on a more emotional level. This made for some truly epic moments and considering it took its time, the payoff was way more substantial.Also, while I viewed this in 2D, I feel it would be so unnecessary to see in 3D. No 3D moments. It doesn't seem like it'd have this grand depth of field. It just looks like a lovely 2D production.While ""The Dark World"" may snag an Oscar nom. for its art direction, there's a reason why the nominations stop there. I'm not saying ""Thor"" should aim at an Oscar (that'd be spectacular though), but just saying it should aim at least somewhat higher. With a more rushed pace, a lack of cohesion (feeling dodgy in parts), and a more than underwhelming resolution, ""The Dark World"" roped me into a lackluster one. It's not exactly a bad movie, but with the inflation of movie tickets, who wants to see an inferior sequel to a better-made original? (Which is cheaper to view by the way).",Thor - The Dark World
232,Caleb_Everett,Thor?,5,23 May 2019,"One of the slowest and dullest movies in the MCU.I love Thor and his entire story, but this movie just kind of drags...the best part of this film is the redeeming factor of Loki, other than that it's just a little out of whack.

234,gerry_barnaby,Slightly over rated but still worth watching.,7,30 October 2013,"Likes : OK ill start by saying I have a positive review to tell you but I have a negative one as well, as this film is slightly overrated. Marvels director Alan Taylor has done a good job with this as its enjoyable to watch, it has it (WTH) funny moment that you do find yourself laughing at because it was funny special some of the Thor & Loki moments in the film.This film does have a dark tone which might be disturbing for younger viewers, visual effect were brilliant as we see lot more of Asgard after the first film, I will say it more of emotional storyline to be honest this time I did find myself tearing up in some parts.There isn't as much character development as the first film, and Thor's friends are nowhere near as interesting as the Avengers. I guess they simply needed these characters to all remain as they were so as to keep continuity within the Marvel universe, but it's noticeable how little impact the storyline will have on anybody.Christopher Eccleston played as Malekith the Accursed dark elves leader played a some what insane bad guy that wanted to turn all the worlds to darkness, there isn't much in the way to say why he was doing this other than the back-story of the darks elves & this world destroying energy.There is a bit at end of the credit but there is a bit mid credits that seems to lend toward Thanos possible for some reason, it was just that one scene that had that mysterious feel to it like something bigger was going on behind the scenes but we don't know yet, as we've heard Avenger 2 or 3 will have Thanos appear so it could be a link but its unclear at this moment.With the character of Loki I did think it was going to be a little repetitive since he been 3 films now but I believe he's character has more of a big part to play in coming events I think he's still working for the dark forces of Thanos for some reason because of he behaviour or it just Loki being Loki. What I did notice was a bit of a jealously Starr from Sith (Jaimie Alexander) to Jane (Natalie Portman) because from what you can see Sith has a thing for Thor even in a moment of the film a scene with Thor & Odin seem to suggest that.This film in the way of fighting scene dose have a few battles but not much, probably the most important character in the film showed just what he can do even tho he a gate keeper but from what I saw he can seriously kick ass Heimdall play brilliant actor Idris Elba I through it about time some one write him in the storyline doing something awesome instead of just watch the gate & the universe because he has such a style in he acting he stands out with an on screen presence.For me the comical moment were OK but some people mite find this ruins the dark tone of the film because it become less of a serious film at times & more of a comedy film of Thor, but it enjoyable to watch.Dislikes : The negative side of this film, is the slight humour I did find that it wasn't really need but Disney being Disney they want a film that kids can watch as well, I think Malekith character as to why he want to turn the worlds into dark could of been explain in the back story but it wasn't real much explained .My only real complaint about this film was the way it ended the last 5 Min's of the film You could see what was going on but there was curtain elements as to why & what the hell is happening.It leave you with an open ending with no closure with you wanting to see more to see what is going on in that scene but that where the credits role. This main is why I feel this film is slightly overrated .",Thor - The Dark World

236,kaden_lewis,Thor: The Dark World,8,16 June 2021,"Once again, we have another good Marvel film that is severely underrated. ""Thor: The Dark World"" in my opinion was better that the original. It felt different in a couple ways. It had a better plot, better story, better action, and even better acting. I really enjoyed the plot about The Dark Elves trying to turn the Nine realms into eternal darkness as long ago as 5,000 years, during the alignment of the Nine realms, when Odin's father was on the throne, and then coming back 5,000 years later just before the next alignment to try again. I also liked the story of Jane being infected with the Either and needing to get it out of her, during that, we got to see Jane go to Asgard, and Thor and Loki team up to try snd escape Asgard after it went into lockdown. The action, and final battle scene were also better in this movie. As I am watching Marvel's movies latter into the franchise, I can see the action getting better, and them getting a hold on how to make a good action sequence. The last thing I saw improved was the acting, in my opinion both Chris and Tom largely improved.I really recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch it. Don't listen to the critic reviews, this is a good movie.",Thor - The Dark World
237,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,7,8 November 2013,"The first Thor was a fun, entertaining movie, that featured interesting characters and a very interesting story (I simply love myths and legends), along with good acting and a great villain. It wasn't a masterpiece, but nobody should expect too much of a superhero movie: they are all made to entertain with enjoyable sci-fi mumbo jumbo and some fan service for the female public – which is kind of unusual, since men are the main target audience of superhero movies, and we haven't had any relevant/good female superhero movies recently (or even ever?). But I digress; the important thing here is that the first Thor was good and – according to the superhero movie rule – the sequel should have been even better: was it? Thor: The Dark World starts by telling a myth about Dark Elves, their lord Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and how he wanted to send the whole Universe into darkness by using a strange substance called the Aether, but was defeated by Asgardians. In the present, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is still waiting for Thor (Chris Hemsworth) to return after two years, and investigates all anomalies she encounters. Such an anomaly makes her invisible to Heimdall (Idris Elba) for some time, so Thor, worried, comes to take her to Asgard, where they discover that the Aether runs through her veins and is slowly killing her. Chaos ensues as Dark Elves attack Asgard and Thor has to team up with Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to stop them.The first thing that you might notice about this movie is that it is laughably silly, but also very entertaining: it is almost 2 hours long but it doesn't feel like it, and it doesn't bore. Actually, the ending almost feels rushed and I wish it were a bit longer and more developed. Action and non-action scenes alike are entertaining and interesting. But it is very silly: the Dark Elves, the exposition, the story itself – everything feels as if it was made for really dumb people who, hadn't the movie been so simple, would have flooded the internet with ""I don't get it"" threads. But still, I found it enjoyable and laughed at the silliness a few times, especially at that one scene – that goes nowhere – where we see Thor shirtless, washing his hands and then staring at the distance. It lasts a few seconds and is completely useless – except for maybe making girls faint/stare in awe. A truly good movie feature is the villain: Malekith is quiet, ruthless, dangerous – he doesn't joke around, he truly wants to kill everybody.Christopher Eccleston, who plays Malekith, is great (and maybe that's why he never looked good as The Doctor: he's much better at playing villains!), and I want to congratulate him for being able to stand 6 hours of make-up every time to look like Malekith. Tom Hiddleston is simply amazing as Loki, he stole the show and fit his role perfectly. Too bad he got so little screen time, especially considering the other actors. Hemsworth is still good, but Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman are just awful. I can understand Portman's horrible performance, since she wanted out of the project (but wasn't allowed) when Patty Jenkins, who should have directed this Thor, dropped out due to creative differences. I still have to find a reason why Hopkins looks so bored and tired the whole time. I sure hope one of them gets a Razzie for Worst Supporting Actor, because they really ruined the movie – just like the awful green screen in some scenes, which is shameful for a movie that has such a big budget. In conclusion, Thor: The Dark World is an entertaining popcorn flick that could have been better but that you'll enjoy nonetheless.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/",Thor - The Dark World

Thor 2 opens with a Lord of the Rings style sequence with a lot, and I really mean a lot, of incomprehensible mumbo jumbo that I couldn't care for at all. Hopkins delivers his silly lines as if Shakespeare himself wrote them...which is kinda funny. Several actors are once again underused (Russo, Elba), the villain is even more one dimensional than all the previous MCU villains. The story...ah well I just did not care one iota. Hiddleston is good, as always, but not as effective as in Avengers. Hemsworth as Thor is at his most entertaining when he is playing the slightly stupid hero on Earth. You do get to see some of this in his interaction with Natalie Portman during the third act on Earth.

But its sequel is really interesting,,,,.... The story starts in the same manner in which iron man 3 has started,,,,after the event of the avenger in new York....Thor is back to Asgard with Loki,,,,of coarse Loki was kept in prison....In the same time in some other part of the world,,,,the king of darkness was planning something bad.... The plot of the movie was not much interesting as compared to captain America or the avenger with some physics here and there etc.....But was good enough to hold u to your seats,,,,Whats actually rise your interest while watching the movie is the screenplay,,,,how a not so interesting plot was shown in an interesting form,,,,that's the strength of marvel comics,,,,they don't give enough strength on the plot as DC comics does,,,,instead of that they make there screenplay interesting,,,,and Thor 2 has a lot of humour jokes which will make u laugh rolling down your seat in the whole movie.... No doubt the action sequence are good too,,,,i haven't seen the movie in 3d but it was good in 2d too.... The best thing in the movie was the character of Loki(remember the villain from the avenger)....This time he was in the right side helping Thor but for his own profit,,,,and i guarantee u this man has a high sense of humour and is the most charming and 2nd most interesting villain (after joker from dark knight) in all time Hollywood movie....The chemistry between Thor and Loki is too good.... Natalia Portman is an Oscar winner actress,,,,she can do a superhero's love lady role with closed eyes,,,,so she was good enough too....

241,japamo,"Glorious and Gloriously Preposterous,""Thor: The Dark World"" Makes Armageddon Both Dire and Fun",9,26 October 2014,"Successful depictions of mythological tales embrace both their grandeur and bizarre but entertaining illogic. Marvel Comics' ""Thor"" recognized this, as did the original ""Thor"" movie, and now its more cosmic, world-spanning sequel, ""Thor: The Dark World"" (hereafter ""Thor: DW""). Even though not only Earth (Midgard) but all the Nine Realms of Norse legend including Asgard, abode of the gods, are threatened by an existence-ending ""Dark Side"" as embodied by the liquid Aether, ""Thor: DW"" manages to intersperse and sprinkle dry, understated, but sharp humorous dialogue and situations throughout its epic tale.This is no trivial feat, since along with the expected warrior battles and clashes and imminent Armageddon (or Ragnarok), ""Thor: DW"" deals with forbidden mortal love, latent mortal/deity romantic jealousy, incorrigible and enigmatic siblings, obstinate and imperious fathers, self- sacrificing goddesses, unhinged astronomical geniuses, and charting your own destiny. Within each of these elements ""Thor: DW"" explores both their serious and light-hearted sides.Pointy-eared but cruelly saturnine Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), the Dark Elves' leader seeks the Aether to bring back the darkness they need to live and extinguish the hated brilliance of Asgard and the other worlds. The Asgardians, led by Thor wielding his enchanted hammer Mjolnir, have managed to wrest the Aether from the Dark Elves and hidden it within what they think is a totally unexpected place. However, astrophysicist and Thor's mortal love interest Jane Porter, incensed by the Thunder God's long absence, attempts to locate a dimensional portal in order to contact him again. Concealed within a London warehouse district, she finds not only the portal, but the Aether as well. The Aether possesses her.Malekith, with the brutal assistance of the ape-like juggernaut (no, not that Juggernaut) Algrim/Kurse, has sought to recover the Aether for over 5,000 years and use it for universal darkness once the Nine Realms are linearly aligned. Realizing that Jane has now become the Aether's vessel, Thor transports her to Asgard in an initial attempt to protect her from Malekith. Nevertheless, Malekith, Algrim, and the Dark Elf armada of dagger-shaped ships soon breach even Asgard's seemingly-impervious defenses.Against the edicts of the Lord of Asgard and Thor's father Odin (Anthony Hopkins), Thor decides that instead of remaining besieged behind Asgard's fortress, he will take Jane to true safety in an obscure dimension. To do this, he must free and make an uncertain Faustian alliance with the God of Deceit and Evil, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), imprisoned in an Asgardian dungeon for crimes he committed in the ""Avengers"" movie. To buy time for the escape, Thor asks the omniscient, all-sensing Guardian of Asgard Heimdall(Idris Elba) to risk treason by running interference for him. And so ""Thor: DW"" boils down to whether Thor can save Jane and the Nine Realms (including Earth) from Malekith and the Aether.Yep, these are literally deadly serious issues the movie is dealing with. But with effortless skill, ""Thor: DW"" sees the inherent overwrought silliness of it all and gently teases and prods it without diminishing the importance of these issues. For example, Thor faces a towering, Goliath stone creature in a scene that might remind you of Indiana Jones and the swordsman in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". As another example, to help the jailbreak along, Loki transforms himself and Thor into various figures including an out-of-left field patriotic one. Back on Earth, Jane's brash intern Darcy (Kat Dennings) sardonically and bemusedly comments on the wild proceedings when the Thor/Malekith battle spills over onto Midgard. Jane's oddball but enthusiastic mentor Dr. Erik Selvig, committed for streaking at Stonehenge, has nevertheless seemed to discover a gravity-shifting device that might avert the alignment, provided Darcy and her own callow but cute intern can get him out of the mental hospital. Finally, loved all the dimension-hopping and throwaway critters, especially in the very last scene.The humor also makes ""Thor:DW"" more relatable even to people who are not Thor or Norse mythology aficionados and fans. Without it (and without the introductory exposition) at the movie's beginning, newcomers might be at a bit of a loss as to who these outlandish characters are and what the heck they're fighting for. They might not know who grim Hogun (Tadanobu Asano), dashing Fandral (Zachary Levi), voluminous Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), or the stunning Sif (Jaime Alexander) are, but they know about romantic entanglements (Sif gives Jane such a stare), a son's duty to a father (Thor in Odin's shadow), and perseverance in finding the hidden bravery and self-sacrifice of a previously selfish and treacherous brother (Loki's helping Thor defend Jane), and finding the courage to blaze your own trail in life (Thor resolving to stay with Jane on Earth). Therefore, ""Thor:DW"" manages the neat trick of making Armageddon not only foreboding but also satisfyingly enjoyable. 4.5 starsP.S.: ""Thor:DW"" is a self-contained story in and of itself, even if you haven't seen the first ""Thor"" movie. But I heartily recommend you see the first movie, and watch the credits of this movie, because they continue Thor's story and raise doubts about Loki's reformation, AND connect to a broader Avengers story line involving some powerful stones. Verily, Thor will return.",Thor - The Dark World
242,sammielimehouse-84658,"Not Terrible, Not Necessarily Good",7,15 April 2021,"This movie is one of the worst MCU movies, which isn't me saying it's an absolute dumpster fire, but compared to the other movies in the MCU, this just doesn't hold up. The tone is all over the place, the villain is probably the most forgettable in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe, and they killed off Freya for pure shock value. Honestly, the only thing that's truely entertaining about this movie is Loki and Thor's relationship. All in all, this movie isn't great, and is one of the MCU's lesser films.6.9/10.",Thor - The Dark World
243,drew_atreides,Hiddleston steals the entire show,7,8 November 2013,"In the original run of Marvel movies i think the one that i expected the least from was the first THOR. I was surprised when that one actually came out as the BEST of the Marvel flicks leading up to AVENGERS. Heading into ""THOR: THE DARK WORLD"" my expectations were significantly higher (though after Iron Man 3, maybe I should have tapered them), and thus i came out of this one slightly disappointed. Hemsworth's Thor really doesn't have much character development in this one. He was much more enjoyable as the spoiled-boy prince who earns the right to wield Mjolnir. Here he's kinda wooden as the wounded-puppy longing for Jane Foster. And when you see what Foster has been up to you really wonder what the guy could ever see in her. Honestly, the human characters in Thor 2 are the weakest link. Too much bad writing and too many cheap jokes that fall flat. Kat Dennings brings her ""2 Broke Girls"" shtick to the movie and it bombs badly. Portman's Foster is a pretty unlikable witch of a character. And what have they done to Stellan Skarsgard?Chris O'Dowd appears to be written as a poor sap of a nice guy who is being passed over for He-of-the-golden-locks, but he actually comes out as someone you root for and want to tell ""Hey, buddy, it's okay. You're better then her anyways!""That's the real problem with the movie, the only person you really root for is Loki!!And how easy that is, as Hiddleston just chews this movie up and eats it for breakfast. Anytime he is on screen, the enjoyment factor goes up.The bad guys have a real cool look to them, but they aren't really developed to any point where they felt like a threat. And while interesting in concept, the final fight is head-scratchingly yawn inducing.It was nice to see Rene Russo actually have something to do here, and Hopkins was once again solid as Odin. And thank goodness for that saw-it-coming-but-still-lovely-to-see twist ending.I liked it. It was okay. But it wasn't as good as the first Thor.High hopes for CAPTAIN America:WINTER SOLDIER.",Thor - The Dark World
244,Morbius_Fitzgerald,Tired.,4,1 September 2014,"Now before I start, I want to make it absolutely clear of 2 things; 1. I liked the original Thor movie, it wasn't great but I'd call it entertaining enough that, if anyone wanted me to sit through it again, I wouldn't object. 2. I know that this might sound like ""Oh, Morbius is just going on with the same old thing, he didn't like The Avengers so he obviously will just blindly hate on every Marvel film"" no, I can assure you, in this review I have measured up each pro and con as fairly as I can.The plot is basically the same thing you've seen in a ton of these films; bad guy tries to take over the world, hero tries to stop them and get a love interest into the mix. There isn't that much else besides that. Its been done to death in these films and for the most part, done better.However, I do have to defend other aspects of this film before I get to the complaints. Firstly, the CGI is amazingly well done. The acting is from just about every player, pretty solid, the action scenes are all really well done and I'll at least say, its watchable.Now onto the complaints, now you would've probably seen the first film. Assemble in your mind each and every single complaint; the love relationship is underdeveloped, the humor is bad, the writing is bare bones simplicity and it under uses the movie's best talent. This film has all of those things but to a worse off degree than the first. As if, instead of saying ""How do we improve this over the original?"" they said ""How do we make more flaws in writing than the original?""First off, the movie's talent is just, as I've said twice, under used so much that its pretty much ridiculous. Stellan Skarsgard is the worst one because as much as Anthony Hopkins and Christopher Eccleston are under played, at least they don't have this god awful humor. What passes off as a joke in this film? Skarsgard running around Stonehenge naked, Skarsgard not wearing pants, and the oh so funny antics of Kat Dennings, even though the Jar Jar Binks comparisons are a little harsh, she's still pretty bad.The love relationship is just terrible in this movie. Natalie Portman and Chris Hemsworth have little to no chemistry and most of that, I blame on the writing. Now, okay, when it comes to other blockbusters where Portman played the love interest, it had worse writing (STAR WARS EPISODE 2) but in this, they share little to no scenes together, they barely talk to each other alone (and wouldn't she question ""hey, what was up with that alien army I saw you fighting on TV?"") and they don't even say goodbye to each other when the film ends. However, to their credit, both actors are trying, good god are they trying, but nothing works and after reading that, how can it? Apparently the Bifrost Bridge is repaired...out of nowhere, so what is keeping them apart? In the first one, it was made clear, in this one, its like Thor has ADD and can't decide whether he wants to be with her or not. But, oh, that would ruin Marvel's formula. Um...f#ck formula! The Marvel formula has been in use since 2008 and its getting tired! Captain America 2 had the ""f#ck formula!"" attitude and its by far the best Phase 2 movie.So, overall, I don't hate this film, there are certainly good things about it but enough for me to like it? No. While its not the worst I've ever seen, it is an annoying film with the ""playing it safe"" bland formula Marvel has decided on what works. Hello. Can just one Hollywood movie take a risk? That's what makes people remember it.",Thor - The Dark World
245,mitchell5954,"Not as Good as the First, but still Entertaining.",7,11 November 2017,"Thor The Dark World is a very action-packed, visually pleasing, and entertaining time at the movies. I ultimately really enjoyed the movie. However, the film does have some notable issues. In some ways Thor 2 is superior to the first film, but in most it is inferior. The film takes place sometime after the Avengers. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has been locked up in the prison in Asghard for what he did in New York. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and everyone else are fighting to restore peace to the nine realms. Meanwhile the villain named Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and his race called the Dark Elves have returned from their slumber. Their goal is to obtain a substance called Ether to destroy the nine realms and return everything to darkness. Meanwhile, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her friends come across a dimensional anomaly. This is happening because all nine realms are lining up which happens every-so-often. Because of this she is transported to Asghard and back and is infected with Ether. Thor must now save Jane and all nine realms from the Dark Elves with the help of Loki. The film has many great qualities. The effects are amazing. The effects in the first film were already great, but this film ups the ante. The effects are twice or even three times better than the first film, as is the world building. This film showcases more of the nine realms, and also fleshes out Asghard better than the last film did. The film spends more time in Asghard and in the Dark Elves' home world than on Earth which I was okay with. I did not dislike the time spent on Earth like many people did, but I just found the scenes on Asghard and the Ice Realm to be more interesting and fun. Lastly the action scenes are greatly entertaining, especially the Loki prison break scene. The action is another thing that is upped in this film. I also love the design of the Dark Elves. I also like the technology employed by both the Dark Elves and Asghard. This film does a better job at showcasing the technology and mythology of these different realms.However, where this film excelled in action and effects, it unfortunately drops the ball when it comes to character. There is really no character development in this show. Thor is now a wise leader that puts other first. Other than having to defeat the bad guy there is no conflict he has to deal with, and he does not change or grow. Granted, I would rather have a character remain static than regress and forget the lessons they learn from the previous film like in the Iron Man sequels. However, I would like some form of development for the characters, especially the main ones, but we really do not get that. Thor, as well as the other main characters are still likable and they never irritated me, but I felt that their characters never went anywhere. Odin and Thor's friends in Asghard are given even less to do than in the first film which is saying something. Those characters did not get much to do in the first film, but I can kind of understand because the film is about Thor learning his lesson and about Loki's jealousy. However, here they are given less to do which is a big missed opportunity. I heard a lot was cut from this film, which might include more of Odin, Thor's friends, and the villain, which the film needed. I hope we get to see that footage when the film comes to DVD. The villain is extremely boring and lazy as well. He is probably the weakest kink in this film. He is a generic villain that wants to destroy the world and the hero must stop him. He has no dimension or charm like Loki does. Compared to Loki in the first film and the Avengers this villain is weak. Even in this film Loki is better, because you constantly question whether you can trust him. Also, they threw in this very forced humor that does not work. This mainly occurs when we are on Earth. When we are on Asghard and the other realms the humor they had felt natural and was funny. Occasionally you get a funny joke, but whenever we are on Earth we are treated to unfunny humor. We had quite a bit of humor on Earth in the first Thor but, in my opinion, it was not as forced and was actually funny. I feel that this becoming a thing with these Marvel movies, where they feel the need to through in forced and unnecessary humor. The Iron Man sequels definitely have this problem.Overall, Thor The Dark World is a very entertaining film. There is not much dimension past the action and scope, but the characters are still likable and fun and the action and effects are breathtaking. It is not quite as good as the first film, but is a good movie nonetheless. I think it is definitely worth a viewing in the theater.",Thor - The Dark World
246,jimmyb-03299,I guess the rest of the team was still recovering,6,9 March 2020,Liked it except for if your gonna have a Marvel movie where an alien ship shows up on earth its now an Avengers level threat and expect the rest of the crew to show..

247,evilnigga,Eh not an improvement,2,5 October 2021,"Just like its predecessor the movie hold no weights in the story whatsoever, but this time it's even worst because it's all over the place. They decided to just ruin the movie by narrating exactly what the entire thing is about in the opening scene. Just another forgettable Marvel garbage.",Thor - The Dark World
248,TheSeaLion,The worst of the best,6,22 April 2014,"After the release of ""The Avengers"" in 2012, Marvel entered what has been called the second wave of their films. The second wave contained sequels to films from the first wave, including ""Iron Man 3"", ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and ""Thor: The Dark World"". Critically, ""Thor"" from 2011 did better than ""Thor: The Dark World"", but when it comes to the general moviegoers, they seemed to prefer the sequel over the original. ""Thor: The Dark World"" is the film that I suspect most people wanted the first ""Thor"" to be, a fun superhero-fantasy adventure featuring the hammer-wielding god. In those terms, the film succeeds and is decent, but of all the good Marvel films, it is the worst one.Taking place after ""The Avengers"", Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has returned to Asgard with Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Thor soon learns that the Convergence, an alignment of the Nine Realms which will create portals between all of the realms, is going to occur soon. On earth, the girl Thor formed a relationship with in the first film, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), is infected by a red mist called Aether. Thor brings Jane to Asgard to help her, resulting in an attack on Asgard by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), a dark elf who wants the Aether for himself.The film's plot is so overly complex with magical and scientific gobbledygook that even with the help of websites to remember exactly what happened, I'm sitting here wondering if I explained it correctly. While the portals between realms and all of the magical powers in this film give for some fun action sequences, the film is still left a complicated mess that will leave you wondering whether or not you just are not smart enough to understand or if the film was just not smart enough to pull off what it was trying. I'm going with the latter on this one.Compared to the other Marvel movies, ""Thor: The Dark World"" had the least effect on the cinematic world that these films are based in or on the characters in them. The first wave of films led up to ""The Avengers"", which helped change Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in ""Iron Man 3"", and helped change the world the films are based in in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"". In this case, ""Thor: The Dark World"" is a film where Thor just goes around, fights some monsters and dark elves with his hammer, and saves the day. Granted, the Aether will probably do something in an upcoming Marvel movie, but that could be way down the line in ""Thor 7: Filing Asgard's Taxes"". In the case of this film, there are no immediate effects to either the characters or the world.While ""Iron Man 3"" also relied on an overuse of humor, ""Thor: The Dark World"" takes it up to the Nth degree. It feels like there were two writers for the film, one who was told it was a superhero movie and the other was told it was a comedy movie. Then, both of them worked together and created a script that was half superhero and half comedy. The comic relief was welcomed every now and then, and some of the comedic elements were very humorous, but after a while, it started to get stale. A lot of the characters were made overly-witty and the expansion of Darcy (Kat Dennings) and the addition of her assistant Ian (Jonathan Howard) were comedic relief that went on too long and were sometimes given precedence over the story, sort of like the raccoon, hummingbird, and dog in ""Pocahontas"".While there were a lot of problems with the film, there were still some good elements to it. It was nice to see many of the characters again, including the always changing Loki (and I don't mean in appearance). Lady Sif (Jaimie Alexander) is another character I was excited to see again, who I believe was criminally underused in this film. I was hoping they would explore the love triangle between her, Thor, and Jane, but that never occurred. It was nice getting to see the all-seeing Heimdall (Idris Elba) a larger role this time around and the performance from Anthony Hopkins of Odin was superb.As I said before, the plot can be frustrating at times, but what it sets up makes for some fun action sequences and getting to see some cool worlds. The film also includes a good musical score.""Thor: The Dark World"" takes ""The Avengers"" spot in my opinion as the worst of the best Marvel movies. Its overly complex plot makes little sense and there is no immediate effect on the world or characters, but it is a fun ride with some occasional good humor and it does let us see some of our favorite characters from another realm.",Thor - The Dark World
249,DonaldDooD,No Lessons Learned,4,20 October 2014,"Lulz. The IMDb rating is at a solid 7.2, but the written reviews are mostly panning the movie. And rightfully so. Thor 2 does little to improve from the last entry. While we have better visuals and more Loki, the character, plot devices, and comedic relieve are just as bad, if not worse. If it weren't for the enormous budget, the movie would have blew. I usually give some lenience towards plot devices. You can't let small parts of a movie ruin the entire experience. But crap were they awful here. I've rarely seen a film so contrived, so desperate to use characters that don't belong. But we need to have the brothers team up, and who would our Norse God be without a beautiful woman by his side? The Aether has no rhyme or reason to what it actually does, and the villains were store shelf. But none of the characters had enough time to develop beyond movie clichés.I disliked Kat Dennings in the first one. Now I hate her. She's a complete ditz who has no respect for the impossible events going on. She breaks tense moments with dollar-store lines, devoid of comedic creativity. But we also have some useless intern, and Dr. Erik Selvig. He's turned into ""movie crazy"", a man who acts delusional, but is really a misunderstood genius. Its a stupid and offensive plot point, made by imbeciles who don't know, nor care, about mental health. Thor's Girlfriend (it might as well be her name) still lacks any connection with Thor, and is such a bit player in the story. She's supposed to be a genius scientist, but everything she says is Hollywood gobbledegook. The only strength beyond the production values is Loki. Most of the good moments of the film revolve around him. He has the most personality, and is the only character to develop in any way. But his relationships still need fleshing out. I need more time to buy his love and hate for his family.Are you really that desperate for a time-waster? C'mon. There are better action movies out there. Thor: Dark World will soon be forgotten. I'd never recommend it, but there's worse I suppose.",Thor - The Dark World
250,The_moan_of_all_moans,The World's in danger; let's laugh about it.,5,4 November 2013,"As much as the action is intense and the special effects are stunning, the film - in my opinion - was ironically rather dull. There where a few things that made me lose concentration and interest in the film. For example in the middle of a big destruction filled scene, they try to make you laugh. Why? the whole purpose of an action scene is to become fixated on the screen, to hold your breath while chaos ensues. Not to make you laugh. But OK, the action scene resumes and it build and builds and then....yes they try to make you laugh again. And why? Well because when you strip back everything; when you retract the unnecessary comedy; when you holster the money making action scenes; the story is dull. So, they inject a lethal dose of comedy and romance to try and distract you. And hey, there's nothing wrong with adding comedy to give a more varied experience for the viewer, but doing it in the midst of a Malekith (the so called villain of the film; played admirably by Christopher Eccleston) attack is preposterous; all it does is undermine the fear factor that the villain is supposed to carry; he may as well have been wearing a t shirt saying ""i have no chance"". And it was constant; no real focus on the villain, just little bits here and there. Him and his cronies may as well have been at Santa's workshop preparing for Christmas.Let's build a ""monster"" of a villain and laugh him to death. The World's seemingly beginning it's end and unless you are a scientist you are running for your life. That's basically the story of the film, with also too much happening in it. In order for a superhero film to succeed it has to focus; although profits would disagree with me. But it is because of the special effects that people empty their pockets, to be in the cinema and hear the roar of Thor's hammer, the rumble of explosions. Not the story. Look at Batman's latest outing, three films focusing on the darker side of a superhero; it was simple, the villains where built to be feared. It stayed on track, and apart from one or two one liners in each film, there wasn't any need for comedy because the story was so good. Thor, like Iron Man, Like Avengers will always make money,they will always be blockbusters. But they are not solely superhero films, there is always another character who is just as important as the hero and that should not be the case; unless of course it is the villain and in this film there is no sign of that. The villain is vanilla and when you don't have a great villain, then the hero cannot reach greatness. Action was amazing but everything else was uninspiring.",Thor - The Dark World
251,hooma814,Marvel at their worst,5,18 February 2020,"Watching the Marvel movies in chronological order has been quite interesting so far, but this movie is forgettable at best. I longed for it to finish so I could just get onto the next in the series.The romance between Thor and Jane is dull. Their reunion is almost a bit of a joke. What was even more frustrating though was the movie just assuming the audience wouldn't notice plot holes in the story or that we wouldn't care. It felt lazy in a few areas. The holes lining up over London of all places how convenient? And where have Shield been this whole time? The interns even mention this, as if this covers over the problem. Like putting a plaster on over a fatal wound. And I'm almost certain those planets Jane went to would not be sustainable planets for her even breathe air on and live! Plus she seems pretty chilled for the whole experience she has gone through. If I travelled through space and time to an epic kingdom like Asgard, I would be losing my mind! Jane is like ""meh"", I don't buy it.The supporting characters for me I thought were below average. They felt like a weird mash up of The Hobbit and Star Wars characters. I think they had a chance to create some really memorable and important characters in Thor's story line. Instead we're just left with his lame friends and joke of a love interest that just bring the movie down.In saying that, it does have early hints of the success of Thor Ragnarok towards the end of the film where it starts to not take itself so seriously. Thor in the underground was a classic. Got to love the acting of Chris O'Dowd, little throwback to Bridesmaids seeing him again. And Loki was great to watch, he captures a lot of what I imagine Loki to actually be like. Just when you start to like him again and trust him, he rips it all away.In the end it was pretty predictable and cliched. These Marvel movies really start to head into that dangerous pattern of invincible heroes who always win, get the girl, and thwart the plans of the enemy. Totally cliched with Thor not knowing how to use the ship and randomly button mashing the controls as it magically turns on. This was just stupid for me. Even the mad scientist with no pants was a bit much. This recipe just killed the love of superhero movies for me over the next 3 of 4 years of Marvel movies. Only worth watching if you want to know a bit of the plot really.",Thor - The Dark World
252,toll-8,This film suggests Thor can't live without Loki and should really be saved for The Avengers' movies,5,22 November 2013,"Marvel Phase Two is fully underway now with the second instalment of the section coming in the form of Thor: The Dark World. Kenneth Brannagh has vacated the director's seat and Game of Thrones' Alan Taylor has replaced him with the principle cast all returning, including that scene stealing tycoon Tom Hiddleston.This time out Thor must reconcile with the un-too-happy Jane, who is fully aware he graced his presence on Earth during The Avengers (perhaps like the rest of the world she saw it in her local cinema) and enlist the help of brother Loki to stop the evil Maliketh who has threatened to destroy all nine realms of the universe. The plot is utter nonsense, like we expect from superhero films, but it lends itself to what director Taylor does best; epic battle sequences. Compared to its predecessor this is bigger, bolder and badder with Christopher Ecclestone bringing a darker baddie in the evil Lord Maliketh. Despite the obvious lift from the original this does however feel like a weaker movie. The action scenes are meatier (you expect nothing less from Taylor) but the story has given way because of this, something Brannagh was good at. It is as if the Thor series needs a cross between both directors to really bring through a better movie. Perhaps someone like Joss Whedon, I don't think he's too busy at the moment. Instead what we have with this sequel is an emotionless narrative that allows Loki to shine through once again. We can't help but wonder that if the character was omitted from the films that they would cease to be made. Hiddleston's appearance is briefer than previous outings but he still manages to bring the charm and humour that the first one also had. There is also an excellent and somewhat unusual performance, from Stellan Skarsgard who is a much different character to what we remember. He is also charged with bringing through the humour and via these two characters we are given a film that breaks up epic battles with comedic one liners and scenarios. This gives the film a frustratingly noticeable tonal shift throughout which eliminates any emotional impact the film may have had. Around the half way point a potentially emotional scene takes place but the choice of scenes that surround it fail to lead into and out of it. The editing makes it jumpy and there is little room to settle into one tone before jumping into another.In comic books superheroes are faced with a host of villains. Some are noteworthy and some are trash receptacle fodder. Unfortunately Marvel appears to have picked the latter of the two in their choice of Maliketh. His motives are never explored and his involvement adds little to the plot other than to bring Thor and Loki together.The plot is where the film is really let down. By the time the epic climax takes place (a well constructed battle in Greenwich) the story isn't up to speed and there must have been a scene or two cut that would have brought us emotionally to this level. It is all rather rushed with too many stories being nipped in order to gain more Loki. Even encounters with Jane are skimped on but I can't see this as an issue due to her being a highly unlikeable character. The problem with Thor is that without Loki the character has little going for him but with Loki plot strands are under developed or merely Macguffin's to bring Loki into the story. It makes us question as to whether Thor is really a strong enough character to hold his own movie in the way Tony Stark/Iron Man is. For me he isn't.Thor: The Dark World is a disappointment to the Marvel universe. It is probably slightly better than the original film but that was a weak instalment also. The tone throughout both films alters and it is as if no one really knows what to do with the character. There is suggestion a third movie will be on the way but if Loki isn't around it could fall flat on its face and if he is it may feel repetitive. Perhaps it is time for Thor to hang up the hammer until the Avengers come calling.Rating: 2.5 / 5Directing: The battle scenes are awesome but the emotional elements have little impact. Acting: Hemsworth is fine; Portman is flat so it is a good job Hiddleston is still on form.Script: I can't help but think the script has been altered throughout production.Cinematography: The film looks great (Asgaard especially) and the epic final battle is breathtaking.Score: Adds to the battle sequences.Editing: At times it is far too pacy and doesn't allow the quieter moments to sink in. Overall: Not one of Marvel's finest and raises the question of Thor's ability to carry an entire movie.",Thor - The Dark World
253,drawlife,A little better.,6,3 November 2017,"First off, I wasn't crazy about the first Thor film. It could have been a lot worse. The film peaked after the Frost Giant fight. I'd rate it a 5/10That being said, Thor: The Dark World, is super flawed, but it is leaps and beyond better than the first Thor film. I say that because there are less scenes of Earth, and a lot more Asgard and the nine-realms. I loved the impressive visuals of the Asgardian world that Marvel created and it was pure eye-candy. Hemsworth and Hiddleston truly shine in this film. I loved watching their brotherly banter and how Frigga's death cause them, mostly Loki to undergo some character transformations. I also liked Loki's little ""redemption"" path, and there is a touching scene with him and Thor when Loki is supposedly ""dead."" Surprisingly there was a lot of humor, some of which where the jokes landed, but most of the time it was very annoying. Natalie Portman is wonderful as Jane, Stellan Skarsgard is mostly used for gags, and Kat Dennings as Darcy is used for comic relief, very overused might I add. I disliked her character a lot in the first film, and that hasn't changed since. The Captain America cameo though, that was so awesome. There's much more action in this film than the first Thor film. As I previously stated, the action in the first film peaked when they fought the Frost Giants, but here there's plenty. I loved every action set piece, especially the climax. Director Alan Taylor does a good job blending in fantasy and sci-fi all together, also adding a touch of Game of Thrones in there. As a matter of fact I think he did a better job than Kenneth Branagh in introducing the world of Asgard. My biggest complain in this film is the villain. I wanted more of Malekith in this film. Christopher Eccleston portrays an awesome Malekith, but however there really isn't much character development over him. He's just shown as an evil dude who wants to bring the world to darkness. Nothing more. Aside from a brief introduction told by Odin at the beginning about who he is and what his plan is, there isn't any other character development for Malekith and he really suffers because of this. He doesn't interact with enough characters only Thor and he never goes into any detail about why he's doing what he's doing without a clear motive or reason. Even though they had their own action moments, certain characters like Lady Sif and the Warriors Three that were promised larger roles instead were minor which was sort of a bummer. This film has some re-watch ability factor, where as the first Thor didn't. Thor: The Dark World is just pure popcorn entertainment. 6/10",Thor - The Dark World
254,coljam21,As boring as the first.,4,19 November 2013,"Didn't really want to go watch this because I didn't like the first installment and I should have stuck to my gut. This movie was boring and drawn out. It was a 3 at best but I gave it 1 more star for the awesome costumes. The Jane Foster character is boring and bland and her assistant is meant to be witty and a little wild but comes off superficial and vapid. She's not funny at all and does not balance Foster's character.Thor is great eye candy and so is Loki but that is about all Asgard has to offer. Thor going between Asgard and Earth did not add anything to the movie. The worst part of the movie was the fight sequence in the end. Thor and the villain tangled in a fight jumping from realm to realm for what seemed like 5 minutes was a total waste and didn't make any sense.I almost feel bad for Hemsworth and Portman being stuck in this awful project. I don't know why Portman would sign up for such an insipid project. All senseless action, barely a plot then a juvenile twist in the end in a feeble attempt to make people aware there will be another segment. This time I'll follow my gut and stay away.",Thor - The Dark World
255,The_Celluloid_Sage,Still not overly impressing...,7,6 April 2020,"Thor: The Dark World was the eighth film in the by now well established Marvel Universe along with being the second of the Thor movies. All the key players from the first film return (much like with the other MCU properties) and we pretty much get a similar film to the first, only with a much darker story and bigger and better set designs and scenes.We start with another Hopkins monologue telling us about the events of the past and a mighty war that pitted the Asgardians (Led by Odin's father) against the Dark Elves, led by the evil Malekith (an excellent Eccleston). Malekith wished to send the nine realms back into eternal darkness using the destrcutive force of the Aether, a form of dark matter.Malekith, realising his loss sacrifices his own people in an attempt to destroy the Asgardian army while running away to lick his wounds and lay dormant, biding his time. After their victory, the Asgardians buried the Aether deep underground where no one should or would ever find it. In the current time, Odin is listening to Loki's pleas (a wonderful Hiddleston) while Thor and his friends attempt to bring peace back to the realms.The story and action here are much more quicker paced than in the first film. Much like with Iron Man, the second film, having done away introducing us to the main characters gets us straight into the meat and potato of the action. Action scenes are filmed here and the special effects are mostly excellent along with some beautiful photography.Alan Taylor, who before this big budget feature mainly directed television episodes (with the odd made for television movie thrown in) certainly uppped his game and proved worthy of him being picked. The Dark World is quicker, tighter, faster and more action packed than it's predecessor by a mile. The screenplay is certainly not to Iron Man's standards but is acceptable enough.As for the cast this time round, Hopkins does his best Shakespear once again, Hemsworth as Thor huffs and puffs adequately while still looking every inch the Norse God. Natalie Portman does her best damsel in distress while Hiddleston once again whines and spits his dummy out as (though his much better this time in my opinion).I feel full credit should really go to Hiddleston as I literally cannot stand the character of Loki. In part I'm sure is due to Hiddleston's excellent acting and as said earlier, I feel his is much better in this than he was in the first film or the Avengers. The scene stealing award must go to Rene Russo though. Once again she is thoroughly excellent in a minor role and definitely has the best scene of anyone. Stellan Skarsgård is once again is his usual brilliant self and provides much of the films light relief and comedic moments along with Thor's one-liners and wit.There isn't really much more can be said. Audio is also good and the soundtrack, while impressive is not in your face (ala Iron Man) and seamlessly blends into the background so you barely take any real notice of it. Certainly on a par with the first film and an improvement over Marvel's previous film in the franchise which was a little bit of a let down.
The Sage's Rating: 7/10",Thor - The Dark World
256,StonedMagician,Very Good: 8.0,8,28 July 2019,"The first Thor film was something of an oddity, possessing much more of a comedic element than Marvel's other cinematic offerings. This gave it personality, and made it the better of Marvel's two 2011 films (the other being Captain America). The sequel, though by no means lacking in the laughs department, takes a darker approach to the continuity, with considerably more action than its predecessor. The acting is still commendable across the board, but it is Tom Hiddleston who delivers the breakout performance, perfectly showcasing the pent-up rage Loki has against the world that has exiled him. This time, Asgard is under seige by an ancient enemy known as the Dark Elves. The action has a sort of stormtroopers-vs.-Ewoks vibe, as the Dark Elves cut down the sword-wielding Asgardians with energy-based projectile weapons. While it's obvious that Asgard will not be destroyed this early in the storyline, it does indicate that forthcoming Marvel tales might not be as light as they were in the past.",Thor - The Dark World
257,mjplysaght,Completely forgettable,4,15 February 2017,"Of all the films in the MCU, this is definitely one of the weaker installments, which I hate to say, because the film brings a bunch of ideas into the mix. The problem is the execution. Thor reunites with Natalie Portman and her scientist friends who witness random spatial displacements on Earth. Natalie Portman then gets possessed by the 'Aether', some legendary substance and the most forgettable Marvel villains, the Dark Elves try to overthrow Asgard.Tom Hiddleston returns in this film as the cunning Loki, which I'm thankful for, because he's easily the most popular Marvel villain. However, the story seems to go all over the place in terms of pacing and focus. And at the end of the day, you know there aren't going to be any lasting stakes because they need to produce more sequels at the end of the day.It's disappointing that the Thor films aren't quite to the standard of some of the other Marvel films, because he's practically a god. And yet the majority of this film is bogged down in a forced love story between Thor and Natalie Portman which is reminiscent of Attack of the Clones.The worst thing about this film is that it introduces one of the Infinity Stones, yet the way they handle it is so clumsy. You only find out what it is in the mid-credits sequence, for God's sake.Kat Dennings was quite unbearable in this film also. The awkward humour that comes from her character is cringeworthy at the highest degree. I know that Marvel films like to mix up the drama with a bit of lighthearted humour, but it really seems that in this case, the writers had all the drama established in the script and then at the eleventh hour, they realized ""Damn it! There's nothing funny here! Quick, let's make yer wan from 2 Broke Girls be the only source of comic relief!"" To conclude, this film tries to be epic, and while there are interesting ideas and concepts here, it ultimately falls flat.",Thor - The Dark World
258,ssto,desperately silly but quite hilarious,6,5 November 2013,"i don't generally mind silly clichéd stories and try to ignore them, but gave up and went to the cinema mostly to see some fancy FX. there were some, and some more and then even more - pretty much apart from the shallow story, it is no wonder that the visual effects make this movie, but then there was the astonishing surprisingly good humor! i guess it's the weather in London that helped inspire some crazy little jokes that simply saved the movie.you wouldn't expect that a heroic fantasy movie would be saved by jokes, but here it is, so many little moments that were delightful and helped forget the rest of the nonsense.this and Tom Hiddleston who is the superstar in this episode of Thor, he is incredible and hopefully will be given even more space in another followup. it was he who helped sustain some kind of a story throughout the hollow graphic scenes - what an excellent actor! apparently marvel have realized that the universe of the avengers is what keeps people going to the theaters, so it was really nice to have scenes with ties with the other superheroes, and even continuity with the Avengers movie. i wonder what Disney will do with the star wars franchise, kinda scary that the cashflow is guaranteed with only a mention of some of the iconic characters there...anyway...Thor...quite fun(ny). i wonder how the first episode actually did in box office, but might be there will be need for a new superhero movie soon. because a super hero movie cannot be sustained by jokes only... the original batman somewhat proved it - it was the Dark Knight that made me really consider this a great story.so...Thor...well... :)",Thor - The Dark World
259,GTeixeira,Another fun entry for the Marvel franchise,7,5 February 2014,"Two years after the events of 'The Avengers', Loki has been imprisoned in Asgard and Thor is restoring peace through the realms. As the realms are about to converge and an older-than-the-universe evil awakens again, it's up to Thor to protect his girlfriend Jane, who has the key power needed for the villain to triumph.Part of the 'Phase Two' of Marvel's cinematic universe, 'Thor: The Dark World' is the second solo adventure of superhero and Norse deity played by Chris Hemsworth. It stands strong mostly thanks to a cast that is already more used to their roles.Hemsworth, by now, has already mastered his role. He managed to find the right balance for his character, far more mature and leader-like than in his previous appearances. As before, Tom Hiddleston dominates every time he is on screen as Loki, being responsible for some of the film's best moments. Anthony Hopkins is good, but flawed; his Odin acts a bit too out of character later on, considering how he was established in the first film it is hard to believe he would get so carried away by grief and risk the entire universe for a relatively petty revenge.Earth-wise, once again the film suffers from the same problems. Natalie Portman is quite weak here (as much as in the first), which is problematic considering she has a larger role; meanwhile, Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgard once again serve as nothing but a sad attempt at comic relief. Skarsgard, in particular; his character, so serious and intelligent on 'The Avengers', has been reduced to a pathetic loon that has little to do with how his character had been presented before.The plot is inventive, and the expanding on the Marvel universe was nice. The whole Dark Elves storyline was good, the villains were menacing and challenging (Christopher Eccleston and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje were very good) and the concept of the Aether, while somewhat underdeveloped, was nice. Sif and the Warriors Three, as well as Heimdall, were fun to watch if a bit underused.The special effects and action scenes were nice as always, and even without Kenneth Branagh Asgard kept the same fantastic-yet-medieval look from the first film. The final battle, with the characters moving through dimensions, was a particularly good visual feast.My main problem with the film, though, is not the weak comedic try or the underuse of certain aspects. Main problem is the fact this is an established universe where Thor is not the only hero. In 'The Avengers', it took multiple heroes (Thor amongst them) and a super-secret spy agency to stop an otherwordly invasion. In here, you have an otherwordly being, even more powerful than the one before, who is not wanting to rule the world but to DESTROY IT and ALL OF EXISTENCE... Yet Thor tackles him by himself, and ENDS UP VICTORIOUS?!Considering a 'nobody' astrophysicist like Jane (Portman) could track the dimensional rifting, wouldn't SHIELD do the same and investigate a possible threat? Where is Iron Man, who has been shown to go around the world relatively fast? It is not like no one knows what is happening, as there is a lot of people watching and filming the battle.When you consider it by itself, 'Thor: The Dark World' is a very good and fun superhero film, only dragged down by its weak attempts at humor (8/10). Franchise-wise, however, the film ends up with some plot- holes and continuity illogicality (6/10).The ending was very good, foreshadowed but not overly predictable. The mid-credits scene expands the Marvel universe further, and creates hype for their future works.",Thor - The Dark World

The stories were always more sophisticated than these modern movies, so I usually feel disappointed. The first ""Thor"" was probably the best of the lot, but sadly the sequel fails short.This movie doesn't take itself as seriously as its predecessor. There are a constant stream of cheesy one-liners and occasionally one manages to be funny.Thor and Loki are well played as usual, but Portman's character is just annoying and uneven. Her romance with Thor is about as bad as 'Star Wars Attack of the Clones'. I don't think this is Portman's fault; I just don't think the producers of this movie were very ambitious.",Thor - The Dark World
261,YJLcool,"Another highly entertaining, action-packed sci-fi fantasy action thriller from Marvel",8,6 November 2013,"Thor The Dark World is another highly entertaining, action-packed sci-fi fantasy action thriller with some surprising plot twists and surprises throughout the film. The sequel surpasses the first film for its stunning depiction of the other realms (especially Asgard, which is lacking in the first film). The artistic designs for the costumes, weapons, set designs were nothing short of impressive and visually spectacular.The film has a fine balance of action, humor and emotion. There are more enjoyable action scenes and several emotional scenes involving Loki in this sequel which proved to be better than the first film. The climatic battle and Dark Elves' assault on Asgard were shot brilliantly. There are several interesting cameo appearances which proved to be a delight to the Marvel fans as well. The lead actors managed to deliver charming and heartfelt performances and most of the character interactions in the film were great and handled very well (especially Thor and Loki's constant bicker).However, the film has a rather short running time (a mere 112 mins) considering the number of characters they have included in the film. The characters of Odin, Heimdall, Sif or Frigga are simply not given enough screen time, which is a minor disappointment. The Asgardian army are shown to be too weak considering their ability to invent flying ships or even an Einstein-Rosen bridge (Bifrost Bridge). The main antagonist of the film, Malekith is not shown to be compelling enough or rather generic, his intentions are not fully elaborated and has to rely on two other villains to further the narrative. There are some unnecessary characters and scenes in the film (Notably overly long scenes involving Ian or Richard). Strangely enough, the Dark Elves have their own alien language but the Asgardians don't (they speak English instead).The love triangle between Thor, Sif and Jane was not explored at all in the film.Furthermore, how Thor managed to arrive in New York in The Avengers film is not further explained in this sequel as well(The Bifrost Bridge has been destroyed and it is expected for the sequel to provide a proper explanation...The Avengers film just briefly mentioned that Odin have to find considerable amount of dark matter to get Thor to Earth).Overall, the film still succeeds as a decent entertainment and remain as a wonderful addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that will not disappoint the fans and satisfy most casual moviegoers.Rating: 8/10Note: As for all Marvel films, be sure to wait for the mid-credit and after-credit scenes.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/11/movie-review-thor-dark-world.html",Thor - The Dark World
262,feyipuk,"Watch it for Hiddleston, the rest is comical",7,9 March 2014,"As the ""pre titles"" - history section - to the story tells you, the bad guy - Malekith the Accursed - creates an ultimate weapon to rule the universe, gets stopped, and goes away plotting his revenge. That should give more than enough scope to have large scale battles between the protagonists, plenty of opportunity for Thor to run around smashing righteous thunder into anything he encounters. Like Gimli in Lord of the Rings, but with Legolas's hair. Yet the battles are more one on one. The acting may be strong in parts (which is to be expected with Portman, Hopkins and Skarsgård), yet it would have been good to see some more of Eccleston as the main protagonist. And you can tell that Malekith has spent his time not only plotting, but also in R&D, while the Asgardians haven't learnt much from the previous film. Not to mention the number of pillars that get destroyed, no wonder the world is dark! Hiddleston shines as the tricky Loki, with the rage of a son betrayed by his father, the despair of a son lost to his mother and the contempt of a betrayed and lost brother. He may have been the obvious figure head of evil in Avengers Assemble, but here he gets to play a full range of roles and comes out as the real star of the show. And despite knowing Zachary Levi was playing Fandral, if I hadn't I wouldn't have recognised him with the blonde hair!",Thor - The Dark World
263,TheCasualReviewer,Possibly MCU's worst?,6,31 May 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
Jane (Natalie Portman) has been infected with a powerful elixir that causes Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and the Dark Elves to return to Asgard in an attempt to retrieve the elixir.REVIEW:
This film isn't terrible, but when comparing it to a lot of the other MCU films, it falls a little flat. The whole ""Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) is crazy"" bit that they play for a lot of the film came off quite random and wasn't necessary. Then this film really made me realize that the character of Darcy (Kat Dennings) is completely pointless. Don't get me wrong, I don't think Denning is bad as Darcy and there are even a few moments that I fount quite funny with her, however, absolutely doesn't help the story in any way. As a sorta kinda mannish character that doesn't work. It's also very clear in this film that despite being in a science group, she knows absolutely nothing about science. At least make the character worth something in that realm. Aside from that, I felt that we didn't see any progressive character arc for Thor (Chris Hemsworth) We had a less funny version of himself separate from his other film and The Avengers. Honestly, I felt there was much more to Loki (Tom Hiddleston) than Thor. I found myself wanting to get to the scenes with Loki. Other than that, I think the film was serviceable. The action was decent, good amount of conflict and some entertaining moments. I didn't mind the film as much as I was dreading watching it. 6.0/10.",Thor - The Dark World
264,moviescoundrel,Not so dark,7,8 November 2013,"This follow up was supposed to be darker than the last. It is a bit darker, but not quite as advertised. I know it is popular these days to make an origin story or sequel even darker to attract audiences and works for the most part. It's just not quite as dark overall as the previews make it seem. Part of it is for sure, but it's no ""Empire Strikes Back.""The film is at its best when Thor wields his armor and is in action. This happens much more in the second half but still not quite enough in my opinion, but that's me, an action junkie. The earthly scientists seem like an added on annoyance and that part of the ""convenient"" plot doesn't quite click until the end of the film. The climax is pretty entertaining, as there is a lot of flying, world traveling, portal jumping, hammer flying, action.Characters: Thor (Hemsworth) and Loki (Hiddleston) are the centerpieces here. There's a storyline with Thor and a ""friend"" from Azguard that his dad would like him to court that is interesting and would be cool to see fleshed out, but at under 2 hrs total for the run time, there's just no time. I was glad to see Jane (Portman) back, and the director does a good job of not making her feel like just a third wheel, although there are times I wish she would just stay on earth and let the demi gods do their work.",Thor - The Dark World
265,brent_or,A Mundane Epic,6,12 November 2013,"This is the sort of film that I could write and rewrite a review of several times, attempting to find just the right thing to say. For the sake of avoiding that, I will be brief.Thor: The Dark World brings more characters and a wider scope of a story (and superb visual effects) into play, relative to its predecessor. Unfortunately, it loses the warmth and simple beauty that was present the first time around and suffers from an extremely clichéd, uninspiring and ultimately uninteresting execution of the overall plot. Viscerally, it is like watching handfuls of charcoal pencils repeatedly crushed for a couple of hours. Dark, yes, but compelling, no.It is not a ""bad"" film per se. It is just not particularly good, in my opinion. In the theater, it felt very lengthy and I was fatigued as a viewer, which either means that it is too long, or has the effect of being so. Either way, not a good thing.In particular, the villain is underdeveloped, as is the relationship arc between Thor and Jane. Generally, the story is clear and easy to follow, but it is a bit cluttered to the point of meandering effect, and does not manage to escape a certain pervasive dullness. The employment of humor is a double-edged sword – it undermines the needed elegant seriousness of the story, while at the same time mercifully making it watchable.I want to note a few scenes, though, that do impress and inspire me. Early in the film, a few moments are spent in a tavern and in the street outside, somewhere relatively pedestrian in Asgard. It feels wintry and almost like A Christmas Carol. It also feels more personable than most of what follows. There is a beautiful funeral scene as well, very evocative and for me, a return to the mythological pleasures of the first Thor film. Finally, a scene in which Frigga engages in mesmerizing hand-to-hand combat with the villain. These are instances in which I can feel the potential for how great a Thor film COULD be, with a truly great character-driven story and the right director. Here's hoping for next time.Overall, technically decent but a mundane viewer experience. To put a different way, less than the sum of its parts. I would group this film with The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2 as Marvel Studios' least interesting installments so far. 6.5/10",Thor - The Dark World

This film is a step down from the original, but not by much. The familial dynamics among the Asgardians are intriguing, as always, and relationships are further developed. However, some still do not run as deep as required, resulting in sometimes lackluster dialogue and emotional depth. The fight scenes are solid, but lack the excitement from previous films in the franchise. The Thor sequel relies much on the plot to carry the load, and it mostly delivers. A better than decent story that leaves the audience waiting for the next film truly is what keeps it afloat. Various smart comedic choices additionally provide a nice balance between an ultra-serious Asgard and more lax Earth. The cast does the most with what it has to work with, it seems.",Thor - The Dark World

Thor will take on a journey both dangerous and personal, and he may team up with some people he never would have imagined he would do so.Where Kenneth Branagh's introduction to Thor was a charming, cheesy, even campy fish-out-of- water type of comic book film, Alan Taylor's ""The Dark World"" is tonally, visually, and thematically a different type of film, on a much bigger scale than the relatively low-key first installment. At times it even feels like a sci-fi war movie. On a positive note, it seemed just as grandiose and big as the first one but in a different way. Plus, I enjoyed the character development and interaction between Thor and Loki. They were interesting characters, and I wanted to see their progress as brothers after ""The Avengers"". Tom Hiddleston as Loki is a show stealer; he delivers such great lines with such a great delivery that it's hard not to enjoy. My one issue with the character arc is that when he's brought back to live in the end (disguised as Odin), I have many thoughts about this: how did he live? How did he come back to Asgard? Where is Odin? Is he alive or dead? I wish that was explored more.I also like the mother. She played a more substantial role in being both nurturing and able to stand her ground. When she died, I legitimately felt sadness in seeing a great character pass away. The funeral scene was also very well done and shot. Another positive note was the comic relief characters (the humans) being somewhat tolerable in this one than in the first one. Some scenes with them are annoying, but some (especially the ending) is well done that I really enjoyed their performance.However, my problems with the movie are two things: one is the villain and the other is the actual dark world. For me, the villain was weak and forgettable. Even though Loki was kind of weak in the first Thor movie, he grew on me. This villain is so forgettable and uninspiring that I forgot what he looked like, as well as his motive being very underwhelming. Secondly, the Dark World, a world that has been built up and is in the title of the movie, is so generic and bland that it could've been called anything else.On the whole, it's got problems and issues with the villain, and it's location. However, as a fun comic book movie, it's very enjoyable. I think this is better than the first one because the stuff I enjoyed from the first one is expanded in this movie whilst the things I didn't like from the first movie are either tossed to the side or not brought up that often. It's a fun movie with some problems, but still enjoyable.",Thor - The Dark World

I liked Thor a lot more in this movie than in his first flick and the Avengers. He was much more charming, likable and yet still a force to be reckoned with. Hemsworth's performance was a lot better in this movie too, even with his emotional scenes, like with Frigga's death and when Loki died.Speaking of Loki, he was incredible in this movie as well. His brotherly banter with Thor was so enjoyable because it is what normal brothers actually do. I'm glad that he's still playing his games with Thor and Asgard.I also really like how this movie looked. The first Thor film actually looked pretty good showing the mystical Asgard but in this film it's much more defined. I love the scene with the ships fighting each other because we get to explore the land more. Even the wardrobe for the characters looks better as it doesn't look like plastic but looks very well designed. One scene that was powerful as well as beautiful, was Frigga's funeral. No words were spoken but there was still a huge amount of emotion that could be felt. It also helped that it looked amazing.The villain in this movie, Malekith, was horrible. He was even outshadowed by Loki. He had no development or interesting qualities, we were just told that he was evil. He is no doubt the worst villain the MCU has had.I also have to complain about the humans in this movie. Jane was still annoying, and I still don't believe Natalie Portman as a scientist. Darcy was equally as annoying as total nuisance and caused mass eye rolls in the theater. I still like Selvig, as he's dealing with being under Loki's control. I am actually glad that a good portion took place in Asgard although Jane being there was bad.Even though the final battle took place mostly on Earth, it was actually really fun, having Thor fly around and go through portals to different realms and different parts of London.+ Better performance from Hemsworth + Loki + Asgardian aesthetic - Characters on Earth - Terrible villainFinal Score: 7.2/10",Thor - The Dark World

And MARVEL does nothing wrong while bringing out this new Thor movie. It has all the fine elements of a MARVEL film. Comedy,suspense,action and also a surprise cameo(I'll say no more).This movie's story focuses on the power of Aether which was hidden from Black Elves by Odin's father. Then the story goes on about how Thor stops it from reaching the hands of evil Malekith when the Aether re-surfaces. The best part in the movie is the wry humour, the action of course and a little sentimental touch. And Loki also has a very interesting role in this one. The earth part adds a bit of scientific element to the mythology, thereby making it a complete package.MARVEL's bringing more and more great films with The Avengers franchise and also a good TV series (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D), so we fans are definitely not going to miss this one.

273,aaronjbong,"The God of Thunder Returns, with More Lightning",8,2 November 2013,"Marvel's superheroes just keep coming. It's just only been a few months since the release of the immensely successful ""Iron Man 3"". Now it's Thor, the God of Thunder to strike back. Thor is of course the least relatable of the Avengers. But that doesn't stop this movie from succeeding. There are multiple references to what happened in the blockbuster ""The Avengers"". Often referred to as the ""alien invasion in New York"", it doesn't really play a major role in the primary plot in ""Thor: The Dark World"" itself. So, even if you haven't watched ""The Avengers"", don't worry, you won't feel left out.The plot of ""Thor: The Dark World"" concerns with something extremely ancient. The Aether is kind of like a fluid that is extremely full of energy and is able to turn ordinary matter into dark matter. This ancient relic begins to play its part in the story after scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) travels to another world accidentally and encounters it. It is later revealed that every 5000 years, the nine realms will be in perfect alignment and therefore, borders between these worlds become blurred. This is an event known as the ""Convergence"". However, due to the recent activity of the Aether, a race called by the Dark Elves, led by Malekith, are awakened. Apparently, they were once ruthless rulers who were defeated by Odin's father Bor. Bor vanquished the Dark Elves and it started a peace that lasted for thousands of years. However, Malekith wants the Aether to plunge the whole universe into total darkness. He intends to that at the peak of the ""Convergence"". Now, it's up to Thor to stop Malekith and his evil schemes. If Thor is to defeat Malekith, he's going to need help from someone unlikely...... Loki.Yes! A team-up between Thor and Loki. This is one of the most exciting components of the film. Thor is serious, powerful whereas Loki is wise-cracking, mischievous, and very tricky. Together, they form a very well-balanced duo and seeing them work together is true joy. There is plenty of action. Of course! It's a superhero action movie. But the superpowers incorporated here are mighty and therefore the sequences are intensified. The Aether is slick and don't forget, Mjolnir is a ravager. The 3D is amazing and I watched this in IMAX 3D. Not all of the scenes were shot in IMAX, but some of the landscapes were incredibly beautiful. More of Asgard is revealed and it really is gorgeous. The movie also had a comedic nature. In fact, it was funnier than I expected. The mischievous and charismatic Loki is plenty of fun to watch. Watching him on screen is pure delight and his character is extremely interesting. But you also have to keep an eye on Dr. Erik Selvig, Jane's ally. He's gone a bit crazy in this movie and therefore, his antics are hilarious in the movie. Malekith is an all-powerful villain and he is intimidating. However, I didn't really think he was an interesting villain. His background is rich but that was short. We don't know really know Malekith. He is extremely devoid of character and sometimes, he's so boring. He, along with his race, speak a language that sounds like pre-historic dialect to me. Performances were wonderful. Chris Hemsworth is a well-rounded character and has given Thor adequate depth. Natalie Portman is stunning as the pretty and intelligent Jane Foster. Anthony Hopkins shows his class as Odin. Tom Hiddleston is flawless as Loki. His performance is top-notch. Christopher Eccleston's performance was polished enough, although his character was a bit boring. So is it a good movie? Yes. ""Thor: The Dark World"" is a good sequel and I would say that this exceeds the original in quality. I enjoyed the film although the villain was kind of dull. It may fall in some aspects but overall, this is a great success. And as a Marvel film, check out the two post-credits scenes. Rating: 8/10Final Verdict: ""Thor: The Dark World"" is a well-polished sequel that has great action, excellent chemistry (especially between Thor and Loki), but lacks character in the villain.",Thor - The Dark World
274,freewillyfan,Thor the Dark World,6,3 November 2019,Thor the Dark World is a pretty forgettable movie. There is some good action and acting. But there earth scenes aren't interesting and Natalie Portman doesn't seem interested in the film. The plot is forgettable and the villain might be the worst in the entire MCU. Loki is great again and the scenes with him and Thor are good. Overall and average movie.6.5/10,Thor - The Dark World

Series movies like Marvel are becoming more and more popular, which is not a good thing.",Thor - The Dark World
276,adamsmith-51004,"""I wish I could trust you""",6,16 April 2021,"The Dark World offers plenty of action, some really funny moments, great performances, and per MCU custom, sets the stage for more adventures to come.In the years since this movie came out, it's garnered a reputation for being among the weaker entries in the MCU.It seems like a lot of the criticism is directed at the movie's villain Malekith the Accursed, played by Christopher Eccleston. Personally I really like the guy. Sure, he's not Thanos-level great, but for the most part he works as a villain to watch and Eccleston does an good job with the material he's given.Some criticism's also been directed at Kat Dennings's Darcy. Some people say she has too much screentime, but not really. We only really see her at the beginning and during the 3rd act, but that's about it. Plus, she manages to get some pretty funny moments, especially one gem towards the end.Criticisms aside, The Dark World is a pretty entertaining movie, and I hope that other people feel the same way. In this movie we follow Thor in the aftermath of The Avengers, and he works to take down the Dark Elves, an ancient race ruled by Malekith the Accursed. However, in order to stop him, he's forced to make an uneasy alliance with his brother Loki before the whole universe is plunged into darkness forever.Chris Hemsworth once again turns in a great performance as the God of Thunder, and it's nice to see Thor act more like a noble individual after seeing his pompous attitude in the first Thor movie. Like with the first one, Natalie Portman does a good job as well, and she gets a bigger role in the story this time around. We don't see Stellan Skarsgard's Selvig as much here, but he still gets his moments, this time being more paranoid after the events of The Avengers.Again, Tom Hiddleston's Loki is a standout here. Interestingly enough, I've heard that they cut out material featuring Malekith in order to feature more of Loki due to his popularity. That does make me a little sad, as it may have helped better flesh out Malekith in the eyes of viewers, but what are you gonna do? Anyway, we see Loki feeling even more alienated than ever in this movie after The Avengers and the first Thor movie, and you can't help but feel for the guy, despite his history of misdeeds. We see him struggle with personal loss this time around, and it helps make him a more interesting character to watch. I think deep down he really does love his brother and his father, despite being treated unfairly. That said, if he has to get the Asgardian throne by faking his death (again), then he will.The cinematography in The Dark World really is something to behold. Alan Taylor takes over directing duties from Kenneth Branagh, and he manages to make a great-looking flick. The costumes are beautifully designed, the CGI is great, and the action scenes are fun to watch.The Dark World, like all MCU films, has teases for what's to come in future MCU installments, such as Odin going missing, Thor's continuing journey to becoming king, and this movie introduces the second Infinity Stone, the Aether, AKA the Reality Stone. And in one of the post-credits scenes, we get an appearance by new characters that appear in future MCU movies.",Thor - The Dark World

278,hkauteur,HK Auteur Review - Thor: The Dark World,8,5 November 2013,"Thor: The Dark World properly continues the story after The Avengers (sorry, Iron Man 3) and Thor. It retains the things that I liked about the first installment without repeating them. The plot moves fast and it's intense. Things never gets too grim and has a genuine sense of adventure and awe. Dry witty humor is used again effectively to balance out the ridiculousness of Norse gods walking amongst humans. The fights look tough and grueling, more so than in The Avengers. Partly because everybody's physically melee fighting and the Dark Elves are actually physically challenging to Thor and the Asgardians.The Nine Realms are explored more thoroughly and the audience gets to spend more time on Asgard, which is a much more interesting place to be than Earth. The designs and world creation are impressive, particularly in the disaster sequences. It shows how brilliant an idea it was in the first film to imply that magic is unexplainable science, thereby combining and justifying both.Chris Hemsworth owns the role of Thor with his presence. Thor is a character whose depths are only shown when interacting with other characters, which is that served as a disadvantage in The Avengers. In his own movie, there's an immense cast to give him that depth. I liked his arc in this story. Natalie Portman gets to be the fish out of water this time around and it's an entertaining reversal.Tom Hiddleston again oozes charm as Loki. It's a great actor relishing a great part. He plays the audience like an instrument as we intermittently love and hate him. The writers put a lot of work in designing the twists and turns in Loki's infinite mind games, truly earning the character the title of ""God of Mischief"". Loki fooled me again and again throughout and I kept wanting to trust him.The Warriors Three gets wrecked a bit. It seemed like there was some scheduling problem in which Tabanobu Asano's Hogun had to be reduced. Also, I prefer the Joshua Dallas as Fandral, who had to be replaced by Zachary Levi from Chuck. Levi by comparison seems to struggle channeling Errol Flynn. Both cases are unfortunate.The new villain Malekith played by Christopher Eccleston is buried under a lot of Dark Elf make-up and speaking an alien language in his own scenes, which removes any chance of proper scenery chewing. His presence as a villain is ultimately functional on par with Hugo Weaving's Red Skull. Malekith exists for the main characters to grow and there's nothing wrong with that. In fact, it is noteworthy. Marvel seems to be ensuring that their villains never are more interesting than their heroes. The heart of the story is still the central relationship between Thor and Loki. In fact, it's probably the most interesting relationship in the current Marvel cinematic universe. Director Alan Taylor knows this and competently moves their story forward.The numerous Stan Lee cameos is starting to get creepy because it means there are a growing amount of Stan Lee lookalike clones in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And is it me or has Anthony Hopkins been playing the majority of his roles like a Norse god all this time? I am just kidding.Depending where Captain America: Winter Soldier goes with Captain America's story, I wonder how many more solo movies Marvel actually needs to plan out. It doesn't look like they're planning any solo Hulk films and Iron Man seems to be up in the air right now. Who knows how Guardians of the Galaxy is going to turn out. But they can really just start doing more Avengers movies at this point. That said, I do want to see what happens with Thor and Loki in a third installment. Actually, a third Thor is very necessary.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",Thor - The Dark World
279,jaguiar313,"Edgier but, still enormously entertaining sequel.",8,7 November 2013,"Thor was one of my favorite of the Marvel Phase 1 movies. I loved it's fun mix of fantasy and real world adventure and thought Hemsworth made a noble and very likable hero. And now the Norse God turned superhero is back in his second solo adventure and a welcome return it is. Thor: The Dark World opens 5000 years earlier with an alignment of the planets being taken advantage of by the Dark Elves and their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) to unleash a weapon called The Aether which will convert all the worlds into dark matter where only the Dark Elves may exist. Thor's grandfather Bor (Tony Curran) defeats the invaders and they are assumed destroyed and The Aether is hidden away never to be found... or so Bor hoped. But, in the present, the worlds are aligning again and the long dormant Malekith and the remaining Dark Elves seek to destroy all once more and, as fate would have it, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) stumbles upon the hidden weapon and it is absorbed within her. Now hunted by Malekith, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) brings Jane to Asgard against Odin's (Anthony Hopkins) wishes and must somehow find a way to stop Malekith, banish The Aether and save the woman he loves and all the known worlds... and the only one who can help him is his devious step brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) imprisoned in Asgard's dungeons by Thor's own hand. This second solo adventure is this time directed by Game Of Thrones and Deadwood director Alan Taylor who creates a much grittier and down to Earth version of Asgard then the bright and magic kingdom-ish version we saw in the delightful first feature directed by Kenneth Branagh. It's still recognizable as Asgard and it blends perfectly with the first Thor but, we get to see far deeper into the city and into it's halls and pubs and get a more lived in and functional look at Thor's homeland. The tone of the film is also darker at times and that was a nice change from the upbeat first film and Avengers but, so not to get too dark or grim, the film is punctuated with a lot of fun and humorous sequences especially those involving Darcy (Kat Dennings) and Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard), the latter's trip to Stonehenge being especially hilarious. I thought the humor and the darker story elements were blended just fine and there was plenty of action and strong drama throughout till the big free-for-all ending set in London where Thor and Malekith finally get to throw down. And the action and special effects do not disappoint, they are top notch as all the previous Marvel films. The budget is on screen in all aspects from sets to costumes to FX. Taylor gets good work from all the cast. There are some nice character moments in between the drama and destruction and all the actors are now very comfortable in their roles and work very well together. Hemsworth is once again a noble hero who has grow since his first visit and the battle in New York. He and Portman still have a nice chemistry together and I liked their scenes especially when Thor has to explain where he's been for two years. Dennings gets a bit more screen time and handles it well getting some of the bigger laughs and Hiddleston is once again scene stealing as Loki. It was also nice to see Rene Russo get a big scene and have a bit bigger part this time and Hopkins is still endearing as the weary but, majestic Odin. We also get some nice scenes with supporting characters Heimdall (Idris Elba), Sith (Jaimie Alexander), Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Fandral (now Zachary Levi) and Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) but, those expecting expanded roles from this bunch will be disappointed. Newcomer to Thor's world Christopher Ecceleston, is OK as villain Malekith but, he really doesn't make a strong impression or stay with you after the film is over. To me his somewhat tepid villain is the film's only real stand out weak point. Taylor's interpretation of Don Payne and Robert Rodat's script is highlighted by a moody score by Brian May and some nice cinematography by Kramer Morgenthau. Overall, Thor: The Dark World is a very entertaining follow-up that gives us enough of the action, drama and suspense we are looking for and takes it in enough of a different direction to keep it fresh but, not straying too far to alienate us. It's not perfect, as stated the villain could have been stronger, there are a few slows spots here and there especially in the first half and earlier on we can tell there was a bit of editing to manage the running time but, for all the entertainment we get, those minor flaws can be overlooked. A fun and worthy sequel to both Thor and The Avengers and certainly less schizophrenic then the mixed bag that was Iron Man 3. As with all Marvel films stay through the entire credits for not one but, two additional sequences and keep an eye out for a couple of really fun cameos. Another solid bit of entertainment from Marvel and Disney.",Thor - The Dark World
280,michael-3204,Cracks in the MCU,5,14 November 2016,"The strain of intense serialization takes a toll on ""Thor: The Dark World,"" the eighth film in Marvel's on-going cinematic universe. Natalie Portman is back as Thor's earthly romantic interest, Jane Foster, which necessitates a slightly awkward part-explanation, part-avoidance of why Thor seemed to forget she existed during the events depicted in ""The Avengers,"" in which Jane did not appear. Coming up with a compelling story that is about 70% a continuation of ""Thor"" and 30% a continuation of ""The Avengers"" and fits into the larger, on-going MCU story line that is supposed to culminate somewhere down the road paved with Infinity Stones is a tall order, and the multiple writers don't quite pull it off. Neither, however, do they completely fumble, and Alan Taylor's serviceable direction as well as a solid cast most of whom we're familiar with do a good job of smoothing over the rough spots as much as possible. The cast is really the best feature -- Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston are by now so comfortable with each other that it is easier that ever to believe these two were raised as brothers, it's good to see Portman again and Kat Dennings as Jane's sister is more of an asset to the story (and slightly less annoying) than she was in ""Thor,"" Rene Russo as Thor's mother gets more to do, and there are a few pleasant if minor additions to the human side of the story, including Jonathan Howard and Chris O'Dowd.Unfortunately, the movie doesn't spend as much time exploiting these strengths as it does on yet more universe-threatening, lazily conceived super-villains, the Dark Elves, and on fake science and fake legend about astronomical convergence. ""Iron Man 3,"" the first film in the MCU to follow ""The Avengers"" and the one immediately preceding this, played it smart and didn't pretend the universe was at stake, for the obvious reason that such monumental stakes would call for the involvement of all Avengers. This film is not so smart. Despite the high stakes, the film really doesn't go very far afield. After the globe-trotting qualities of the most of the MCU, this one feels studio-bound and more reliant than ever on computers to create any sense of scale.The fun thing about Thor as originally conceived was the supposition that what most people regard as Norse mythology was, in fact, based on powerful aliens whom the primitive humans would have perceived as gods. The first film got that; this film, rather than explore that motif in more depth or even play with it, opts instead for mumbo- jumbo about gravitational anomalies that helped ancient peoples build temples and what-not. It's meaningless drivel and a little insulting, both to ancient civilizations and audiences' intelligence. I'm all for suspending disbelief, but give us something worth suspending it for, not a grammar-school rehash of ""Chariots of the Gods.""This is still better than ""Iron Man 2"" and not really appreciably worse than ""The Incredible Hulk,"" which was more coherent but duller. It is, however, the first in the series that makes me wonder whether Marvel can really pull off its ambitious enterprise as consistently as it hopes.",Thor - The Dark World
281,OlieRendch,It sure lives up to its title - a very dark film indeed.,6,1 November 2013,"So a year on since the Avengers assembled and Loki has been in prison while Thor is making peace in the Nine Realms while the Bifrost was being rebuilt. So after all that is explained in the first 10 minutes we get to the story line which revolves around a Dark Elf known as Malekith and his search/revenge plans. Christopher Eccleston did a very interesting role although after watching I think he didn't own it, other people could have done it as well, if not better. That didn't ruin it though as another, unexpected, plot point revolves around Loki and the issues of trusting him which make for some very twisty and questionable scenes. I'd have to say I enjoyed the parts set on Earth more rather than in space for some reason, but all in all I liked how it looked although some elements I had seen before in other media. There were of course references to past films as the Tesseract got a mention as did New York. So my final thoughts are this: the special effects were great, the plot was OK but I've seen better, and all-in-all I have the same feel about it as the first, it didn't wow me but neither was I bored, it was just in the middle.",Thor - The Dark World
282,aldri-feb,2013's best superhero franchise,7,1 November 2013,"I have no expectation before watching this movie after a disappointment that 'Iron Man 3' had marked months ago. Unpredictably 'The Dark World' is above what I think it would be. 'Marvel: The Avengers' franchise has never been this much fun since first 'Iron Man'. Alan Taylor as director dares to take risks in storyline and makes it out from comfort zone. Some action scenes are entertaining and sometimes hilarious, especially when Loki involved. Thor character is shown much more development than the previous movie. In 'The Dark World', Thor is described more grown up and more responsible to save Asgard and Earth from villain's threat. Also the studio has succeeded to exploit Thor's power in this movie that doesn't happen in first franchise or in 'The Avengers'. The presence of Malekith has succeeded enough to give good impression as villain. Perhaps there's quite disorganized in plot and some jokes aren't in the right place. Overall, 'Thor: The Dark World' is one of the most memorable superhero movie this year, also great one from 'The Avengers' franchise. The IMAX 3D is worth to watch though.",Thor - The Dark World
283,fluturoj,Fantasy,6,24 August 2016,"The movie was more comical than I expected, in a very good way. I just love when Thor comes to earth and I just loved Loki's sarcasm in this move. He nearly became my favourite character. And I also love how parts of different sequels are all linked and connected. Makes me feel like I am watching a huge TV show, only that is in movie parts and extremely better done. Oh was I glad that someone (Jane herself) actually mentioned how all that was Jane's fault. I was starting to get frustrated how no one was bringing that up. It was like a huge elephant in the room and I just couldn't bear. The real-life lessons: didn't find many instances that made me think that that could be a useful lesson in real life. Plausibility: at the beginning I was thinking that it is totally impossible that from everyone in the plant Jane was the one that found the Aether, but I was happy that the movie justified this by giving a believable explanation- she found it because she was looking for Thor and following the signals by having some of the most advanced devices and not to forget the anomalies that made this all possible since all the worlds aligned. So logically, no one was looking harder and with more advanced equipment then Jane so the odds of her being the one finding it were pretty good. Character development: I liked how Loki's character stayed true. He helped Thor but he still had his own agenda. Not the totally bed guy with greed and ambition that can't let him be called honours and good. Storytelling: this is where I didn't like the movie so much. The story got a bit boring and was moving slow and you could expect the ending. You thought that Thor's plan would succeed and he alone would be the one to bring an end to it all and that's exactly what happens. No twists. I think Loki's survival was supposed to be a surprise but somehow that was also expect able. It would have been more interesting if he actually died (even tough I'd hate that).",Thor - The Dark World
284,DubhDoo,Thor-rific,8,3 November 2013,"Marvel are everywhere at the moment. In the past two-and-a-half years we've had 'Thor', 'X-Men: First Class', 'Captain America: The First Avenger', 'The Avengers', 'The Amazing Spiderman', 'Iron Man 3', 'The Wolverine' and now, 'Thor: The Dark World'. There are also four more Marvel movies to follow next year – 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier', 'The Amazing Spiderman 2', 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. This could seem like overkill, except all of the aforementioned movies already released have been good and some great. Which now brings us to Thor's third big screen outing – how does it compare to slew of Marvel movies around today? Very favourably.Following the chaotic events that rocked New York in 'The Avengers', Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) are back in Asgard, with the latter being imprisoned for his crimes. The Nine Realms appear to be in order, but an ancient race is on a vengeful path – The Dark Elves, led by the villainous Malekith (Christopher Eccleston). Upon discovering a portal between Asgard and Earth, scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) accidentally reawakens them and they set their sights on Thor's homeworld.In stark contrasts to the recent DC films (except 'Green Lantern', but let's forget that ever happened), Marvel Studios' movies are unadulterated fun. 'Iron Man 3' and 'The Avengers' set the bar high for the level of sheer fun and Thor's latest continues along this path. It's also leaner than every other recent action blockbuster and all the better for it, as e.g. by the time the 30 minute climactic battle in 'Man of Steel' begins, the end credits start rolling on 'Thor: The Dark World'. Additionally, the action sequences are terrific and exhilarating, while the comedy is properly funny and occasionally hilarious. There's also an unexpected cameo from a Marvel regular that is one of the most joyous things I've seen all year. Alan Taylor uses his experience from the brilliant 'Game of Thrones' to great effect when approaching the fantasy worlds. As per usual, Tom Hiddleston is a delight to watch, lighting up the screen whenever he appears, while Hemsworth is efficient and the rest of the cast are solid. There are flaws – one or two plot strands disappear and some roles are underwritten. However, 'Thor: The Dark World' may not be a profound classic, but it is gloriously entertaining from start to finish and a very worthy addition to the ever-expanding Marvel canon. Also, make sure to stay for the entire ends credits, as we got, not one, but two post-credit sequences, which I won't spoil, but I will say that one of them offers an excitingly weird glimpse into a future Marvel movie.",Thor - The Dark World
285,jafar-iqbal,"Not as good as the first film, but fun nonetheless",7,24 November 2013,"Phase 1 of the Marvel Project is all done and dusted, a phase which started on a massive high with the first Iron Man (arguably the best solo Marvel superhero film to date), and ended on one with Avengers Assemble (the best Marvel film, in my opinion). Marvel Films did what was seemingly impossible, and did it unbelievably well. So, like millions of others, I waited with bated bread for Phase 2 to kick off. Iron Man 3 rolled around andheh. It wasn't an awful film and the Tony Stark character took an interesting turn, but it didn't live up to the success of his first two outings and the Marvel standard as a whole.Which brings us on to the next step of Phase 2 – Thor. The first film was one of the big surprises of the genre. While his other superhero friends are steeped in some level of reality, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is from an entirely different world, so the task of bringing him into 'our' world and making it believable was a tough one. But they did it, and the result was a thoroughly entertaining film that took advantage of the character's supernatural elements. With the sequel, directors Alan Taylor and James Gunn (taking over from Kenneth Branagh) decided to amp the supernatural side up even more.While the first movie introduces us to Asgard, Thor's home planet, The Dark World is set almost entirely in the alien world. This time, Asgard is under threat from an even darker foe hell-bent on literally destroying the entire universe. The epic plot allows the film to explore Asgard with much more detail, and we gain a better understanding of how the world works. Expectedly, we're treated to some gorgeous CGI and special effects, making it fun to watch. The fish-out-of-water formula is also subverted as Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is now in Asgard, essentially playing our eyes and ears. Unfortunately, that formula isn't as successful as it was in the first movie. Watching Thor try to make sense of Earth is genuinely hilarious, but we don't quite get that with Foster. Funnier than that is seeing Foster's Earth friends go about their business (Kat Dennings, in particular, is very funny).In fact, the scenes in Asgard, as a whole, aren't overly amusing. That is, until, one Tom Hiddleston enters the fray.As Loki, Hiddleston is once again sublime. That scathing sarcasm, the wry smiles, his excellent diction and tone; everything about the performance is a pleasure to experience. It is by no means an exaggeration to suggest that he steals every scene he is in. My favourite scenes were the ones that he was in – just waiting for him to say something, and knowing it was going to be gold. And it pretty much always was. The character's journey in the film is also very gripping, and sets us up nicely for whatever might come next. Loki is to Thor what Iago is to Othello: he is the actual main character, he is the one we want to see. And just like people have argued that Shakespeare's play should be called Iago, I would strongly argue that the film should have been named after Loki.Where we have a problem is that, when Loki isn't on screen (and his screen time is crucial but limited), the film just never seems as engaging. I found myself missing the character, and wishing he was ever-present. I won't reveal any spoilers but will say the ending makes up for that longing, but that doesn't stop the film suffering because of it.This is, overall, why the sequel just doesn't work as well as the first film. And it isn't just the lack of Loki's presence; other characters I wanted to see more of were used sparingly. Kat Dennings, as mentioned before, was one of those characters; and Stellan Skarsgard was another. Instead, we saw a lot more of Anthony Hopkins (boring and uninspiring), Idris Elba (strong presence but also boring) and Christopher Ecclestone (who is completely unrecognisable but actually quite good).Don't get me wrong, The Dark World is not a bad film. It's much better than Iron Man 3, and there is enough excitement and good action to stop you getting bored. It just isn't as engaging as the first one, that's all. Sadly, Phase 2 of the Avengers Project has started with a bit of a whimper; we can only hope it gets better from here.",Thor - The Dark World
286,BiiivAL,"Second, but not in quality",8,13 June 2018,"Honestly, Thor was never my favorite superhero. I liked the first film, but did not make much enthusiasm, and in ""Avengers"" all my sympathies were given to Tony Stark. Therefore, ""Torah 2"" I waited without much trembling. And if it were not for my love for the Marvel franchise and not the prerequisite on which I managed to visit, then perhaps I would not even have gone to the movie to film ... And I would have lost much! ""Thor 2"" was just an excellent, incredibly exciting movie adventure. Unequivocally I can say that this film-sequel I liked much more than the first ""Thor"". The creators of the picture made a serious work on the mistakes, took into account many shortcomings of previous films and significantly raised the level of quality.In general, I was very pleased and pleasantly surprised. And now I will try to briefly describe my impressions, to reveal the pros and cons of this film.1. A fascinating and rather original story. ""Thor 2"" is a film with a completely new, separate narrative. Formally, it is the continuation of the first ""Torus"" and ""Avengers"", although the main storylines with these films are not connected in any way. Describe the story - it's a thankless task, a great chance to give undesirable details. Therefore, I will confine myself to general remarks. Firstly, it is very gratifying that the plot of the film does not develop according to the scenario of the ""Renaissance of the Legend"", according to which, judging by everything, practically all the fantastic films released in the last year were shot. Secondly, it's worth to praise the writers for the fact that the action develops systematically, powerful action scenes alternate with lyrical digressions and small humorous insertions - that's why the film keeps the viewer's attention for all two hours. Thirdly, I am glad that the film will not be delayed: everything is lively, bodrenko and laconic. Well, the last moment, which I wanted to comment on is the ending. For most viewers, it turned out to be very unexpected. As for the inconsistencies and some logical blunders, their presence seems inevitable for almost every fantastic film. Besides, in Torah 2 there are not so many of them (in comparison with the first film, at least).
2. Excellent graphics and special effects. Life in the 21st century taught me not to be surprised at anything. I do not know what special effects need to be invented so that in the current conditions they make a special impression. Therefore, ""Torah 2"" I'm not going to consider from the point of view of sensationalism and some novelty. Of course, if I had seen a schedule of this level even five years ago, then it is quite possible that I would lose my speech. Today, this film is just dignified. All special effects are well worked out. From this position, this picture can be safely put on a par with the same ""Man of Steel"", for example. There are, of course, individual details that looked excessively computerized and slightly unnatural, although for fiction it is forgivable. Of course, this tape is worth watching in 3D format, so as to maximize the effect of presence.3. Beauty! What not to take away from this film, so this is a beautiful picture. And for each viewer the understanding of this beauty will be very special. For example, the male half of the hall was fascinated by the unrealistically divine views of Asgard and really spectacular mass scenes. Their companions were much more interested in Thor himself, or even his material shell, which he actively demonstrated. Undoubtedly, all spectators, regardless of their gender and other characteristics, appreciated the beauty of the night sky, stars, incredible nature and architecture, which is abundantly presented throughout the film. A beautiful picture is accompanied by good music, which has already become quite traditional for the genre of fiction.
4. Friendly cast. After the ""Avengers"", it seemed that the actors' ensembles of the subsequent crossover movies Marvel would look bleak and insignificant. It is for this reason that the third ""Iron Man"" caught up with a bunch of actors who, in fact, played no special role in the development of the plot. In ""Torah 2"", the main actor's skeleton was removed from the first film, and there were almost no new actors. Due to this, the screen does not create an overload in terms of unnecessary dialogues and unnecessary scenes, and the cast seems very friendly and united. Of course, the main thanks are due to Chris Hemsworth (who, incidentally, after the movie ""Race"" has grown very much in my eyes). He easily becomes the center of the film, brilliantly copes with all the tricks, comfortably feels in the costume of Thor (which is said to be terribly uncomfortable) and perfectly interacts with other actors. In this film, he makes his character more charismatic and profound - and this can not but rejoice. Natalie Portman, of course, is good. But she practically did not show her character development. Although, of course, it should be praised for her work, because in comparison with the first film, from a purely physical point of view, it was much harder for her. Loki Tom Hiddleston continues to be one of the most disgustingly attractive villains in the fantasy world. And the rest of the actors are an excellent way to distract attention from the main characters and bring to the film a share of humor and diversity.Also worth noting that the film is full of ""little joys"", calculated on a fan base. For example, very pleased with a small, but very funny cameo Chris Evans in the role of Captain America. Or already become a classic cameo by Stan Lee. There are also soul-stirring allusions to previous franchise films. And most importantly: do not forget to stay at the screen for a few minutes longer! You are waiting for two additional episodes: the first - after the incredibly colorful final titles, the second - after the usual basic titles. Both episodes are very interesting and directly lay the path to the next film Marvel ... (personally my rating of expectations after these episodes at times increased).
TOTAL. ""Thor 2"" is a spectacle that keeps the viewer in suspense from the first to the last seconds. Bright, colorful, saturated, dramatic and even quite unusual, moderately tragic and moderately ridiculous fantastic action, which is absolutely not a pity to spend two hours of free time. This is a solid and high-quality product, which you can safely forgive some plot flaws and inconsistencies. ""Thor 2"" - perhaps one of the best fantastic films of the year and one of the most worthy sequels for this genre.Unexpected, very nice gift. A real surprise for fans of fantasy and specifically the magnificent Marvel franchise, which, apparently, only gaining momentum ...Enjoy watching!",Thor - The Dark World
287,rahuljonathan-nair,Good story in the sequel with nice twists!!,9,14 November 2013,"Wonderful performances by Thor, Loki, Jane, Odin and Malekith and the story continues to be charming!! The effects are amazing but the best moments are when Thor and Loki share screen space. Loki has the power to make you empathize with him, but is that just another one of his deceptive tricks? Thor, Loki and whole Norse mythos is as complex as any school of mythology that was formed eons ago in days of old, when magic filled the air. This movie is also about sibling rivalry as well as a long-distance love story with an intergalactic twist. Don't miss this one. Note: You may not like this film if you don't enjoy superhero films. And don't forget to watch two post-credit scenes which has a surprise!!!",Thor - The Dark World
288,ryanskywalker-87402,"I am Odin, King Of Exposition, Guardian Of The Nine Parts Of The Script We Couldn't Figure Out A Graceful Way To Shoehorn Into Dialogue",5,29 April 2017,"For all the heavy operatic bombast, the best moments of Thor: The Dark World are the small nuances of character and scenario. Thor getting on to London subways, the little conversations between characters like Darcy and Thor, Thor's nonchalantness after taking down a giant rock monster (""Anyone else?"") and the fact that the second half is essentially a buddy road trip movie between brother's who essentially hate each other. The best scene of the movie might just be the wake that the Asgardian's hold for fallen royalty. Between the sombre tone, the choreography and the grand light bearing cinematography, you get That is exactly how I would imagine this society sending off a royal figure.Unfortunately, for the most part, the movie is not really concerned with these moments. The movie has a lot of plot, and it thought the best solution for that would be to go straight through that plot like a bullet. This might be a symptom of this movie's troubled production (would not be the first for Marvel). This was originally meant to be directed by Patty Jenkins, but for reasons I don't think have been fully explored quit or was fired, leaving the project for Game of Thrones Alan Taylor director to complete. With the appreciated focus on fantastic settings and action sequences, this is certainly a smart choice (though I do miss the brightness of Kenneth Branagh's setting). When Jane says something to the effect of a device completely changing the laws of physics, it's essentially a wink to say that the action is about to get wacky. And thankfully it fulfils that promise, nabbing from video games like Portal in the best possible way.But in getting to that point the movie spits through a lot of its building blocks. Without comic knowledge I wouldn't really know what the aether was, and hints of B-plots (like a love triangle between Sif, Thor and Jane) are left on the cutting room floor. Within two minutes the movie goes from Thor and Jane having seen each other for the first time in two years to them both being in Asgard trying to get a alien power source out of her body. There's a bit missing in between those two pieces where the two just sit and around and talk. The Dark World is missing those parts of movies that we think are superfluous, but in reality add to mood, pacing and character.And the story's weird pacing becomes more of an issue when the new characters are so ill-defined or wasted. There are small things, like the fact that Selvig turns from a minor comic character in Thor and a tragic figure in The Avengers to an over the top, naked clown here. Stellan Skarsgård's performance almost makes it work, but then you remember that they only get rid of him in the first half of the plot so he can turn up for convenience sake in the second half. Also *SPOILER* whilst the second half after the death of Thor's mother shows the correct level of grim pathos for a movie called The Dark World, the first half forgets to make us care.Then there is the movie's most notable problem, one it keeps repeating but is exacerbated most here, is the movie's villain. Why spend so much time with a prologue on the Dark Elves if you are going to waste Christopher Eccleston and make Malekith so unmemorable a villain? In fact, Malekith is such a generic villain, with lack of clear motivation and no characterising beyond ""bad"", that that he has ironically become ""memorable"" again as the default example of Marvel's Villain problem (on television guys like Kingpin and Kilgrave have solved this problem). Thankfully the movie's second villain, Loki, again elevates some of the material by Tom Hiddleston's charm and the charm between his and Chris Hemsworth alone. In fact, a movie that is just those two and their relationship would have probably been among the highest of Marvel's properties. As it stands, it's a highlight amidst an otherwise mediocre film.Thor: The Dark World might not be the worst Marvel film, but it is certainly the most forgettable. At the time it seemed to demonstrate that the second film in a Marvel solo series would always be the worst. Thankfully, the next Marvel film would shatter that conception",Thor - The Dark World
289,~AleXa~,Simply spectacular...,10,9 November 2013,"Thor: The Dark World 9.5 out of 10.0Simply spectacularTo start, the Marvel superhero franchise is the one of the few second only to Pirates of the Caribbean, to figure out how to make a captivating film. By the end, they leave you with a feeling of breathlessness and exhilaration that is rare to find in movies these days. You feel as though you were with the characters on their journey, felt what they felt. They accomplish what any great film should—to make the audience feel as though they lived the movie for those two hours. Those kind of films excite and inspire me in a way that cannot be described, something rare that you cannot put a price on.Thor: The Dark World manages to do just this quite effortlessly (so to speak). The characters in my opinion are the backbone of the film, and they are beautifully written and portrayed. Particularly if you watch its predecessor beforehand, you can see the evolution and development of the characters. Thor has learned humility and sacrifice, and to deal with a pain brought on too soon. Loki is evolving as well, and it is exciting to watch Tom Hiddleston deliver a performance that opens your heart to what may arguably be the most well-written antihero of all time. Loki is so conflicted, torn between his heart and his drive for power, continually struggling to control the onslaught of emotions swirling around inside him. Always sly and manipulative, he finds an advantage and a witty retort for every tense situation. Even though he is devious and cannot be trusted, the pain and torment he endures pulls at your heart, and like Thor, you just can't help but hold onto a glimmer of hope that he is still in there and can be reached. This film offers both answers and questions to where Loki's true allegiance lies. Without revealing too much, it is absolutely marvelous seeing a little piece of the good inside bubble up to the surface. The direction was a nice change of pace with Alan Taylor taking over for Kenneth Branagh. Usually directorial changes are at the detriment of the sequel, but not so in this case. He gives the film a feeling of depth and a much broader scope than the first. It's visually stunning, and only wish we got to explore Asgard a little more. The CG is *far* improved in this one as well, lending itself to helping the audience submerse themselves.The transitions from action to drama to comedy were so quick and yet so seamless. It is a testament to the screen writing that we can feel engrossed the pain and loss in one scene and then laughing in the next.I also love that Anthony Hopkins as Odin and Rene Russo as Frigga got more screen time. I only lament that we did not get to see Thor, Loki, and Odin fighting side by side, but perhaps such novelty is reserved for the third installment.Furthermore, I also find fascinating that in theory, the anti-gravitational fields caused by the convergence offer an explanation to otherwise unexplainable things that happen in our own world, and as they state, may be another offering to the fact that in some cases science fiction turns out to be science that we had yet to understand. There is an intelligence and curiosity involved in this film that was grossly lacking in the first.The one complaint I would say I probably have is the lack of character development of Jane Foster. She seems to just be kind of there, with no particular conflict other than the Aether running through her veins. She does show strength, but for the most part is portrayed as nothing more than a woman pining after a man—well, Thor that is. I also thought there would be more of a complication regarding removing the Aether from her without killing her. Furthermore, Dr. Erik Servig's eccentricities I think were a bit over-exaggerated, but it brought humor nonetheless. One could also argue that more elaboration should have been offered regarding Malekith and the Dark Elves, but being as though there were so many shades of gray and eccentricities surrounding Loki that were far more fascinating, there is much less need for it.And I'm not sure if it was just me, but despite all the overall success of the execution of the film, I couldn't help but feel as though some scenes were cut out. It seemed as though we missed something in Asgard with Thor and Jane, and also the bifrost was destroyed and now suddenly it's just there with no explanation?There is a transformation starting to take place in this film as it evolved from the first, and I can't wait to see what direction they take in the next one. I'm not entirely sure how I'm going to last waiting two years to see what happens next9.5 out of 10.0-HM",Thor - The Dark World
290,kuuk3,A good entry into the Marvel Universe,9,29 October 2013,"Having just watched a premier screening, I am delighted to come away from the cinema to write a positive review. Thor Dark World is a spectacular special effect driven film, much of which is set in Asguard.I was worried that including Loki yet again might become a little repetitive, but in this film he excels as a great character, I only hope however that they don't overdue his presence in the Marvel Universe. How many times can this guy come back from the dead?There isn't as much character development as the first film, and Thor's friends are nowhere near as interesting as the Avengers. I guess they simply needed these characters to all remain as they were so as to keep continuity within the Marvel universe, but its noticeable how little impact the storyline will have on anybody.The armies of Asguard were noticeably lacking in fire-power and weapons (even though they have an armoury), which is made even more evident when an entire guard division bring knives to a laser-gun fight. Their turrents were the only defense they had against an Ariel assault and proved to be practically useless. You would expect them to be better prepared.The healing powers of Thor, Jane, and even a smashed alien space-craft become a bit of a running joke as well. But at least they get hurt, even if it only takes them a scene to heal. And if smashing every column holding up a building is still not enough to take it down I'm not sure what will be. Christopher Eccleston played a competent bad guy, although his intentions for what he was doing was still unclear as to why. Its simple to say he was insane and just wanted to kill everybody, but when a threat of that magnitude appears and planetary alignments are in effect, you expect half the Universe to show up and stop him or take advantage of the situation, or come looking to take the power for themselves. I also expected to see the entire army of Asguard come to help out at the end like they apparently did in the past. Not just Thor who appears there by mistake.The scientist with the miraculous plot saving devise is also a little hard fetch to take in, especially when he creates a remote control for cosmic anomalies. Along with Loki's illusion power which also serves as a convenient plot-saving devise at times. I'm willing to overlook these but there's no denying what they are. Overall its a good enjoyable superhero movie, which you will want to watch several times and is a decent entry into the Marvel Universe.P.S. Watch it in 2D, The 3D added little of worth.",Thor - The Dark World
291,rtp4242,Thor: The Dark World. The writers must have been hammered.,2,6 July 2014,"Maleikith (Christopher Eccleston) leader of the Dark Elves possesses the Aether, a weapon with which he intends to destroy Asgard. Thor, (Chris Hemsworth) prince of the Nine Realms, doesn't want to be King of the Nine Realms, but neither does he trust his evil brother Loki (Tom Huddleston) to be King of the Nine Realms either. When trying to slip through a wormhole to try to meet Thor, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is infused with the Aether, and given supernatural powers. Malekith wants to retrieve the Aether from Jane to destroy Asgard and the Nine Realms. Thor can't kill Malekith by himself, he needs the help of his brother Loki. Does Loki help Thor or join forces with Malekith? What happens to the Aether?Thor is when the Marvel cannon of characters hits the bottom of the barrel. Thor is the weakest of all the Marvel superheroes in my opinion, a Norse god with a hammer as a weapon. What's so super about that? The mythology around him is weak, Asgard is not exactly Krypton, Thor is hardly Batman, or even Spiderman, there is nothing compelling about the character, and unlike Iron Man, neither the story nor the character draw the viewer in. I don't care about Thor, or his rivalry with Loki, so what is left is a story with no plot development, no character development, and a movie that jumps form action sequence to action sequence, from special effect to special effect, with no rhyme or reason. And the terminology just sounds like so much gobbledygook. What the heck is Aether, the convergence, the Dark Elves, the Nine Realms? What do the Dark Elves do? Bake evil cookies? This movie suffers from the same problem as the Avengers, a scant plot, underdeveloped characters, and a rush to get to the action scenes and special effects. Again, it took six people to write this dreck, did they take turns writing in crayon?Chris Helmworth is a wooden actor, he brings no dimension to this character. Hemsworth seems only interested in creating a larger than life character, but he brings nothing else to the role. Tom Huddleston is not a menacing presence, neither is Christopher Eccleston. Natalie Portman can be a good actress when given a good script, but she's back in Queen Amidalla mode here, she has very little to say, trying to sound important but is only used as a love interest and damsel in distress. Anthony Hopkins is brought in once again to try to class up the proceedings, it doesn't work. For more Thor-ough reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",Thor - The Dark World
292,Valkonian,I liked it,7,7 June 2021,"While definitely not better than the first one it has its moments. I'd watch this over the 3rd installment any day. Not sure why people are so down on this movie. Definitely better than the trash CGI fest Black Panther.I'll say this, the comedy in the Thor movies are some of the best in the Marvel serie.",Thor - The Dark World
293,yuzou-45815,Nice,8,27 March 2020,"This is a ""sequel that looks too good"" movie. A science fiction movie. A fantasy movie. An action movie. A comedy. A love movie. A disaster movie. A film with subtitles in the end but no eggs .",Thor - The Dark World
294,slicedbread117,The God of Thunder Strikes Again.,7,16 December 2013,"Thor was not the easiest hero for Marvel to bring to the big screen. His mythical roots and overwhelming power never made him the most popular character out there. That all changed with 2011's Thor, and even more so in The Avengers. There definitely are stumbles along the way, but Thor: The Dark World gives another solid solo outing for The God of Thunder.As the second entry in Phase 2 of Marvel's Cinematic Universe (MCU), Thor: The Dark World is restricted to telling a story that will fit into the MCU, but that doesn't hold back the story one bit in this solo adventure. In fact, in ways you don't fully see until the very end, this movie undoubtedly pushes the entire MCU forward in high gear. The plot focuses around the Aether, an ancient weapon hidden by Asgardians thousands of years ago from a race of Dark Elves and their leader Malekith, who has since returned in pursuit of the Aether and Thor must stop him from consuming the universe in darkness. The plot is interesting and involving, but the pacing is a little all over the place, bouncing between a Lord of the Rings in space vibe to the fish out of water comedic tones on Earth. The narrative has some twists, turns and plenty of humor throughout the whole film, but sometimes things just fall out of place. The Nine Realms were also not expanded on as much as I had hoped, giving a lesser sense to the greater cosmos that exist in Thor's universe, but the film's scale still feels large enough to satisfy.Yet even more entertaining than the main plot, is the subplot created between Thor and his fan favorite brother Loki, now a prisoner of Asgard. This subplot almost takes the form of a villain redemption arc, and it is stellar to say the least. At many points in the film, it almost seemed as though Loki was the star of the show.With each new release in the MCU comes an expectation for high-level action scenes and breathtaking CGI. The Dark World succeeds in delivering both of these in the movie, and in top form as well. Large scale battles with ancient sci-fi tech make for some wonderful CGI and entertaining action sequences. Thor himself is not under powered nor is he over-powered, thus creating a hero who is a blast to watch in action, but also has his short comings against a powerful enemy. All in all, the action lives up to the expectations you'd expect from a MCU flick.The aforementioned enemy is Malekith, and along side him his army of Dark Elves and the powerful, Hulk-like Kursed who provides Thor with a re-incarnation of his Avengers tilt with the green machine. Malekith, played by Christopher Eccleston, is a pretty poor villain. Dark and evil yes, and that's the main issue, he's utterly one dimensional and unfortunately underdeveloped, as many MCU seem to be, not getting the chance to really evolve into a movie-changing baddie. Yes there are some moments of entertaining action featuring Malekith, but it can't bring him to a level of a top tier villain, and it hurts the film as a whole.The vast majority of the cast from the first Thor returns for the sequel, and mostly still in top form. Chris Hemsworth still proves that he his the perfect man to play Thor, while the supporting cast is very strong. Tom Hiddleston once again puts on a performance that captures him the essence of a lead role, cementing himself as one of the best characters in the MCU. Natalie Portman returns to portray love interest Jane Foster, a less than admirable performance while Anthony Hopkins provides some awesome star power as Odin. These names are just a few that have important roles in the movie, and the wonderful performance by most of the cast gives the characters depth, and in turn are exciting to watch.Since 2008, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been pumping out pure entertainment for hardcore and casual fans alike. There's no denying that this film has some problems with a lack of some character development, and sporadic instances of feeling too small, but Thor: The Dark World continues on Marvel's triumphant path by delivering a fun, flashy and entertaining movie with solid acting and action plentiful enough to keep the movie from ever coming to a complete halt. With a mid-credits scene that teases some potentially major plans for the MCU, this terrific Phase 2 entry seems to be just the beginning for what's to come from the ever-growing world of Marvel heroes.7.5/10",Thor - The Dark World
295,dinalt10,Not a patch on the first Thor,6,25 February 2014,"Had been looking forward to this film ever since the first was released.Never read the comics, so basing my like of the first film purely on the direction, humour and lead characters.But fast forward to this film, and what happened ? Okay, Kenneth Branagh was going to be a hard act to follow - but this film just seemed to go for CGI and forget the script.Tom Hiddleston and Chris Hemsworth both carry off what passes as a script - but despite the films title, and ample chances for big combat scenes, there actually isn't much combat.A shame, as I'm normally a fan of Christopher Eccleston - but the evil elf character just didn't cut it as a villain.To my mind, a wasted opportunity for the franchise. With its roots in mythology, the Thor franchise has a rich history of combat and tradition to call upon.Even when Asgard was being attacked, there really wasn't much combat - most centred around CGI flybys..............and when there was combat, it was almost playground stuff, and usually seemed to end with an attacker throwing a grenade thing at the Asgard defenders.So not really much use of Thors combat skills - or unfortunately the hammer.And the end fight wasn't exactly thrilling either. Just Ecclestons elf firing the dark stuff repeatedly at Thor - hardly the stuff of legend that the 'historical' fight sequence would have you believe.The first Thor film was fun, paced and directed well - this film certainly doesn't manage that.Ending leaves it open for another instalment. If Marvel go ahead, I hope they look at what people enjoyed in the first film.",Thor - The Dark World
296,andrewnmiller,One of the most surprising movies I've ever watched.,7,11 May 2015,"After seeing the first Thor movie, I wasn't sure how I would like this film because the first film completely blew my mind, so I thought that Thor: The Dark World wasn't going to be as good. Clearly, that wasn't the case because I found Thor: The Dark World to be an action-packed thrill ride with a lot of humor and action, but there were a few minor issues that held it back from being as good as the first one.The film opens with an backstory about The Dark Elves and their leader, Malekith who seeks to plunge the universe into everlasting darkness by using a weapon called the Aether, but before he can carry out his plan, Odin's father, Bor, invades the Elves' home world, takes the Ather and seals it deep within the earth. We then cut to the present day where Loki is thrown in jail for his war crimes in The Avengers, while Thor is busy cleaning up the mess his half-brother has cased. Meanwhile, Dr. Jane Foster is transported to another world and is processed by the it, spending Thor to come to Earth for Jane, but Malekith has sensed the Aether and comes to Asgard looking for it, and Thor now must protect Jane and The Aether from him.The change in directors provides a nice change of pace with Alan Taylor replacing Kenneth Branagh and typically, a change in directors proves to be a severe disadvantage to the movie like Brian Singer leaving X-men 3 and having Bertt Ratner direct, but not in this case. Taylor gives this film a feeling of depth and a much more epic size and scoop to it than the first film had and made it much more darker, but at the same time, more humorous.Now, one might think that injecting Nose mythology with sci-fi would sound like a ludicrous idea but the way that it's added into the story really does make the movie better. The visuals, production design, costumes and overall look of the movie is fantastic and Asgard seems a lot more tangible than the first movie and we get a much larger look at the place plus we get to see other places in the 9 Realms with Svartalfheim being a deserted wilderness. While the first Thor movie certainly had some bad-ass fight sequences, I feel that Thor: The Dark World ups the ante when it comes to the action and getting to see more of Thor using Mjolnir is always wonderful to watch with the two stand-out action scenes are the battle on Vanaheim and the showdown between Thor and Malekith. The humor makes this movie much more enjoyable to watch and it's just hilarious like when Loki, Thor, and Jane are flying a spaceship out of Asgard and Thor is constantly crashing into things or when Jane slaps Loki over the events in New York.As with all the MCU l films that I've seen already, almost all the cast in Thor: The Dark World hit the mark and seem to wear their roles like a well-made outfit: It's pretty clear that Chris Hemsworth has really matured into the character of Thor by being less arrogant and more humble but still maintaining the same level of charm and charisma he did in the first one and virtually dominates the screen. Much like Robert Downey Jr. always being Iron Man or Chris Evans always being Captain America, Hemsworth is and will always be Thor, no questions asked. Tom Hiddleson once again brings his A game when playing Loki conveying a performance that allows the viewer to see what is one of the best written movie anti-heroes ever. What makes Loki such a wonderful character is how torn he is between what his heart says and his lust for power, consistently trying to hold back the attacks of despair buzzing inside him. Continually withdrawn and devious, Hiddleson plays Loki in a way that's oddly fascinating and even though he's scheming and untrustworthy, the pain and suffering he goes though tugs at the heartstrings yet you can't help but love him, plus the scene where he's stabbed and lays dying in Thor's arms is truly one of the most emotional moments in the whole MCU. Natalie Portman returns as Dr. Jane Foster and is just as charming and attractive as he was in the first movie and the chemistry between her and Hemsworth just radiates whenever they are together on screen. Renee Russo gets to have more screen time in this film as Frigga and puts in a pretty solid performance. Anthony Hopkins is and will always be Odin and plays the role perfectly in this movie, playing the old knowledgeable father, but at the same time, being serious when need be. Jamie Alexander, Zachary Levi, Ray Stevenson and Tadanobu Asano are all good in their roles. Christopher Eccleston is effective as Malekith, but I do feel he could have been more fleshed out as a villain and his motivation left a lot to be desired. I never liked Kat Dennings as Darcy in the first film and I still found her to be even more annoying in this film. As for Stellen Skarsgard, he does overact a tad too much here, but it's not a major problem.On the whole though, I liked Thor: The Dark World just as much as the first one. It improved on a couple of things from the first film and added a much darker story. Throw in some great action scenes, some nice romantic moments, awesome visuals and great performances and you have one awesome Marvel film. I will recommend this movie to any Marvel fan or anyone who likes comic book films and be sure to stick around for not one, but two mid-credit scenes at the end of the movie.",Thor - The Dark World
297,SebMoz,I can't even remember 3/4 of the movie,3,14 November 2020,"Whereas the first Thor film at least had a compelling narrative and a main character with a decent arc, this movie seems to forget everything. Thor has been reduced to a boring all-powerful guy, the side characters hasn't got much better, and the plot feels meaningless and tedious. The villain is complete garbage as well, without any personality or depth. The finale is tensionless and you don't really feel anxious about the outcome what-so-ever. I'm also still somewhat annoyed at the portrayal of norse mythologi. The only thing saving this movie from being a disaster is Loki, who actually entertained me, and he worked way better as a side character than a main antagonist. Still, this isn't a movie I feel like watching again, it's definietly one of the worst MCU movies so far.",Thor - The Dark World
298,Badmoviessuck,"Loki is ""dead"" and all you say is NO!?!?",5,19 December 2018,"This movie is bad, everything good they did with the first Thor movie is gone in this one.CHARACTERS
Thor is mediocre in this one.
They didn't do much with Thor that they could have done.
What they should have done is to put Thor to the test and make him have conflicting emotions like they did with ""The Winter Soldier"", in that movie they made Captain America shine throughout the movie and he made choices that moved forward the story, they used his character to move forward the story.
But in ""Thor The Dark World"" stuff happens to him and it's not him making the choices to move forward the plot, he is a passive character.
I have a problem with Odin.
In one scene Odin wanted to start a war with the Black elf's, but wasn't he the guy who didn't want to start a war with the frost people, i don't know if it is an actual flaw or they did this to show how fearsome the Black elf's can be but if it's the ladder then i will hate this scene even more.
Loki is actually not bad.
I like how he exploits others to benefit him and that really adds to his character and it was a twist to find out that Loki isn't actually dead.
Thors moms death was pointless, they shouldn't have killed her because no-one cares if she is dead even Thor didn't care that much (But he dosen't really care that much if any of his loved ones died) Thors mom dying was pointless and the reason they probably put that scene was to show how fearsome Malekith is.
Jane has a bigger importance to in the movie but she is still bad and bland, Darcy (I finally remember'd her name) is bad also but she dosen't have a lot of screen time so she is not as annoying as she was in the last movie, Erik selvig is mediocre and no-one cares about him, Ian has no importance to the movie.VILLAIN
Malekith is trash.
he has barely any screen time and when he does he says cliché lines.
I think his goal is to get the Etern so he can rule the world which is a generic bad guy motive.
and i don't get how Odin's men could win the black elf's, in the beginning scene they are fighting really good and then after that scene the guards are really bad, one guy managed to defeat like 10 guards.
Malekith is the worst villain in the MCU and i hate him.FINAL ACT
The final act was the only good part and it wasn't even good.
The reason i liked it was because it was so bizzare and weird.
Thor and Malekith fight in different places by falling through portals, Thor and Malekith gets smashed and a Frost creature teleports to greenwich.
It's not that weird but it's weird enough to interest me.VERDICT
This movie is peace of garbage and you should not watch it",Thor - The Dark World
299,FluffyPantsReviews,Boring...,4,18 July 2019,This movie is so boring throughout. Chris Hemworth is great as Thor as always and Loki is good also. The dark elves are so boring but do have a cool look just no character. The final battle is not good but the best action scene in the movie is the dark elf invasion of Asgard. Sets up the reality stone. This movie is just boring throughout...,Thor - The Dark World
300,H_Spengler,a pretty decent addition....,7,14 November 2013,"Well, I liked it better than I did the first Thor (my problems with the first being that I didn't find the time allowed for redemption believable, and there was a lot of unnecessary CGI.) And i'm a nerd, especially a big Marvel nerd.While it's true that this movie had a little more going on, my main issue was with how rushed the scenes that were supposed to be emotional, poignant and devastating were.The death of Frigga, the ""death"" of Loki, and the scene where Thor visits Loki are great examples of this. Now, I've read contradictory things on the IMDb message boards with some blaming the director, others, the editors. I don't know who the blame lies with, but not allowing the full emotional impact of this scene to ride out so everyone- in movie and audience could be allowed to feel this was a mistake. Yeah I know that Frigga's tribute is a grand Viking funeral, but this comes after those personal to her are gathered around her. As far as the ""death"" of Loki is concerned, I just believe extending that scene an extra minute would have been more powerful, especially seeing as he is a major and popular character. The elves looked menacing, and like a force to be reckoned with, sadly there's no dimension to them or any dimension to Malekith. They're the bad guys, and we're given little more to their motivation other than wanting the universe in darkness. Hardly any time is spent on them.I'm still not sold on Natalie Portman as I still think her part could've been played by anybody, but at least she's less frumpy here, and boy, does she know how to slap people in the face, oh boy does she ever. A little too convenient that she find herself the one infected by the Aether out of a planet full of billions, but I guess for the sake of the story i'll buy it.Why does Selvig have no pants? And why is he ""crazy""? What drove him to these things, what's the point of it.(What happened to Odin ultimately? Was he killed? was he sent into suspended animation? cast off to a different planet/dimension completely?) Why wouldn't they be gods and immortal? Why would Odin say that? You mean to tell me they can fly, conjure magic, get beaten to a merciless pulp by the Hulk, stabbed, shot with fire balls/flames, hit by cars, endure apparent space travel by falling into the void, and battle with countless entities including but not limited to frost giants, but a mere impaling into the chest would be enough to kill them? or they would simply die after approx. 5,000 years? I felt that line was out of place and unnecessary. Sometimes the CGI was a little overwhelming, and some ""landscapes"" were awful dark and drab, almost to the point of the darkness interfering with me seeing/understand what was happening.Some of the dialog at times I found corny.Now the great: LOKI. so glad he's a big part of this movie too. I highly anticipated seeing what had become of him post Avengers. Every second he's on screen he steals the show. Loki consistently remains the only one in this series with any dimension, development or understandable motivation. Hiddleston is a great actor and has done an outstanding job, The scenes between him and Thor make the movie.Thor: he's grown on me. It took me a while to warm up to Thor, something that didn't start happening for me until the Avengers. Thankfully he's starting to have a personality, and thinking wisely. And yes, his physique is something to behold! Sif and The Warriors Three: They were great, glad we had the opportunity to see them in action again. It will be interesting to see what happens with Sif.There were lots of little moments sprinkled throughout this film, clever little happenings (ie: Thor hangs the hammer up on the coat hook, the subway, the Captain America cameo.)The end scene was great...people cheered in my showing (including myself), and left for a pretty good Asgard cliffhanger. Also, thank you Del Toro, now i'm psyched for a ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movie. Overall not a bad addition, and yes, I'll be buying on Blu-Ray. PS- Studios, yes, give Loki his own movie. But only if you do it right, don't change the character for monetary reasons, and don't take him out of character, you can find some decent script writers who understand what this is all about.",Thor - The Dark World

302,TheMovieSnob247,Disappointing,5,17 June 2014,"If I had to describe this film in one word, it would be: meh. The movie is average at best. The story is very bland and anticlimactic as you never really feel the result is ever in doubt. Yes, I know it's a Marvel movie, but with films like Spider-Man 2 (2004), Iron Man, X-Men First Class and X-Men: Days of Future Past it's clear that Marvel can make a really great film when they want to. It just feels like the movie never really tries to make you question whether there is any really danger and seems like Marvel going through the motions expanding on it's catalogue. Having said that, there is just enough action and more than enough comedy to justify your ticket (and really, that's why we watch these isn't it?). Tom Hiddleston continues to be one of the more interesting actors in the Marvel films and he doesn't disappoint here. In my opinion, this is the least compelling Marvel film since Captain America and no where near as enjoyable as the first Thor film. You can pass on this one. Enjoyed my review? Keep in touch!

But it has been 2 years since Jane Foster and Thor parted ways and now they are reunited because of a darkness that shrouds over Jane's inner body as she infects a most powerful and deadly weapon that could not only destroy her but the entire 9 realms – it takes a vicious monster Malekith (played wonderfully by Christopher Eccleston) to destroy all of the races in the universe to converge it all in darkness. But it takes Thor (Hemsworth) along with Foster (Portman) and Loki (Hiddleston) to save the day. But what we don't know may surprise us – that the Tesseract, the Aether, so close together creates something more deadly than what they could ever even think that could happen to the fate of the entire universe. This movie was excellent and I am looking forward to seeing what is next for our mighty god of thunder.",Thor - The Dark World
304,thomas-w15,Set your expectations low!!!,4,23 January 2015,"Thor: The Dark World 3.5/10- I loved all of the Marvel movies, with the exception of Iron Man 2, and I thought the trailer made this movie look awesome. It was an understatement to say I had high hopes for this movie. It hurts me to say this, but I left a little disappointed.The beginning of the movie to me did not start off well. I thought the idea of the movie beginning with Thor restoring peace to the nine realms was good, however, I could not stop but from thinking that it all looked silly. The costume design looked like it was just mashed together at the last minute and I thought they could have picked a better setting to at least add some tone of seriousness to the opening scenes. I did like how all the Marvel movie including this one continue to offer good laughs through out the film. Unfortunately, there is a time and place for those laughs. Thor: the Dark Work did a relatively good of monitoring where to put those jokes until the final fight scene. The final fight should have had some intensity to it. I'm not gonna lie, I did laugh along with everyone else, but I was still expecting something more. This part that I was waiting for never came and because of this, the movie felt incomplete. The brightest light of the movie to me was Tom Hiddleston. His acting continues to grow and I thought he was even better in this movie than in the Avengers. He is the perfect choice to play Loki, the devious brother of Thor who is not sure which side he is on. Hiddleston dominated every scene he was in. Chris Hemworth delivered another solid performance as the hammer-wielding God Thor. He adds good humor to the character and does the best with the story line that he is given. Natalie Portman does an above-average job at playing the pretty yet extremely clever scientist Jane Foster. Anthony Hopkins seemed like he was not really giving his best effort as he was playing Odin, king of Asgard. Still, Anthony Hopkins worst is still better than most others best. The only time I thought the plot was well-written when the ending came which really got everyone in the theater thinking and that Tom Hiddleston's great performance finally resulted in something good. Now, just like any other Marvel movie, there is a scene after the credits. I was confused by what it meant, but I would be lying if it didn't leave me intrigued and excited for the next one. Was this movie the best in the Marvel series? No, not by far. Aside from its predecessors, the movie still offers enough good laughs and some solid action to make your experience entertaining. Still though, I was expecting a lot more than it gave.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",Thor - The Dark World
305,btkb,Might as well watch it since it is an Avenger movie,9,18 March 2020,"The fight at the end was pretty awesome.It is better to watch this movie to understand what is going on in Endgame, as they do their journey.I gave it a 9/10 because comparing it to the first one, this one looked a little different. It was still great, but it wasn't TOO great like the first one. I guess that is confusing.Pretty much, this movie did not look like it was going to be better than the prequel of it. It is still worth it!",Thor - The Dark World
306,Jemae,Really?,2,2 November 2017,"Boring movie! It wasn't interesting and once again it had those very forced, (meant to be funny) moments again. There was one part that made me laugh/smile, it was when Thor walked into the apartment and hung his hammer up...yep.Also what was going on with Thor's voice? He sounds Aussie (yes I know Chris is an Aussie), Irish and he does some other accent too. Plus some moments his voice is so deep that it doesn't even sound like him. The look of the film, looked good.",Thor - The Dark World
307,ZuhayrRoha,Worst MCU movie but has one of world's best scores,5,24 June 2020,"Patty Jankins(WW director) left the movie for good. The script is really bad. Even at the end Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely couldn't save it. (MM wrote Cap 123 & Avengers 34)For me, Chris Hemsworth's Thor was still unlikeable, just bland cosmic stuffs, Thor is OP and the first movie took his worthiness away for great storytelling but this movie didn't do anything for me to relate to the main character.Loki is a movie saver, he shines in some scenes, changing to Cap, tricking to cut thor's hand, and him in jail in a helpless state was great. His reaction to his mother's death was golden.Jane and the annoying bunch returns and it's bad comedy, only 'meow meow' made me laugh. Natalie and Chris has no chemistry and audience didn't even care to notice that the last kiss wasn't actually even Natalie, but Chris's Wife.A lot has been said about Malakate ( I don't care to spell him correctly) but the actor even said filming was tough because we all know his character is the worst villain ever. This happens when in every movie our hero faces a world ending villain with a silly and unexplored motivation. The final fight was fine, some clever elements of cross world telapotation was available.The aether/reality stone was tied well but there also exist the retcon of solid gem & liquid aether.Positive things, Thor's mother's death was good but they could have gotten more emotions out of me if we had more of her. Endgame did a good job and looking back it now has more emotional punch. The main reasons why I like her death is because it has one of the best soundtrack, 'Into Eternity' it was so good that Taika returned it in Ragnarok.The main theme song is legendary, Bryan Tyler does a phenomenal work. I listen to both the soundtracks time to time.If you are looking for entertainment, it has it. But nothing more to offer than a Blockbuster.",Thor - The Dark World
308,jonconnormustlive-46298,"A step up for Thor, but forgettable",6,6 May 2019,"Thor: The Dark World smartly focuses on fantasy worlds as opposed to taking place on Earth, this gives us plenty of great visuals. The story is quite interesting as well. I like the direction they took with the characters Thor & Loki.The Bad: Pace is slow, this in turn makes the film feel forgettable, the villain is much to small a character to stand out. The film lacks much humor (though I do like serious movies) which makes the pace suffer more.
Overall Thor: The Dark World is still worth your watch, it's a step up for Thor and for the MCU as a whole.",Thor - The Dark World
309,SureCommaNot,The best of the three Thor films,9,29 September 2020,"This movie has it all: the perfect blend of romance, comedy, action and mischief. It pains me to see how much the third film threw off the balance and became my least-favorite of all the MCU films to date.Worth noting is how complex Thor and Loki's relationship was, and how as a viewer you are often trying to understand how sincere is their bond, how problematic the interplay of altruism and hubris, and how layered and nuanced their sense of justice. I contest that none of the MCU films depict this complexity as effectively, and with so many layers, as this one.Unlike the third film, the playfulness in this movie always supported, rather than undermined, both the plot and the character development. In the third film, horrific death was treated as a joke, as was Jane's absence. But here you feel the weight of things.And the mystical elements in this movie made sense; you understood (at least with repeated viewings) how the physics of the trickery worked. Whereas with the third film, well, I still don't understand why weapons just went right through Hela, why such was depicted at the edge of the screen, with no characters seeming to notice or acknowledge her imperviousness, and why the filmmakers had the characters continue to attack someone unaffected by weapons, removing any sense of the stakes involved.This movie lives up to its name, keeps things dark, and it works: very, very well.",Thor - The Dark World
310,Gin-ster,Superman meets Star Trek,9,21 April 2014,"My review is essentially the same as the one I posted for the first Thor movie. It is utterly preposterous; it is hard to follow and the ""otherworldly"" places look phony. Why such a high rating, then? I would've actually have given it a 10 if not for two detracting things: one is that it is too long, with a few fight scenes too many. Yes, we get it; Thor is mighty; the CGI artists are mighty; but these points were made over and over since the opening scene so at the end it seemed to drag.The second detraction is for the asinine comical touches provided by Jane's sidekick Darcy, which are too disruptive to the point where they take you out of the film's universe and into the land of sitcom. These problems aside, all the rest plays beautifully. The blending of myth and science fiction worked very well - it was ""Superman meets Star Trek"" because not only did Thor's might save the universe, so did scientists with their technobabble and gizmos. As to the characters - simplistic, yes, but they outdid themselves compared with the first film. Hemsworth did an excellent job not just providing muscle-bound good looks but was able to capture the angst of the ""Superman"" character, torn between duty and his love for a mortal; and Loki's strange combination of despicable yet pitiful was ""off the charts."" (SPOILER - when Thor visits Loki in prison, Loki at first maintains the visual illusion that all is well with him. Then he drops the illusion, and the sight of what he has become is cringe-inducing). Portman, playing Jane, was at time dangerously verging on a ""sitcom"" rendering of the love interest, yet could carry off the role of someone smart and brave in additional to being, of course, gorgeous.As to the story line - yes, absolute preposterous junk, but anyone watching a movie based on comic books knows that going into it; even with some plot twists and turns, it is never in doubt that ""good will triumph."" Still, I highly recommend this film - with its excellent portrayal of stock characters, the moodiness of the ""universe,"" and the incredible special effects, this is ""dumb fun"" with the highest possible production standards.",Thor - The Dark World

NOBODY CARES THAT YOU ARE SO SELF ABSORBED THAT YOU RUIN MOVIES FOR YOURSELF BY BREAKING DOWN EVERY STUPID THING! JUST GO TO THE MOVIE AND ENJOY IT DAMN IT!I really liked this movie because I didn't look so far into it other than it's a sequel of a good movie that has hot lead roles and an excellent villain. It wasn't as good as the first but it wasn't bad by any means. It essentially had the same feel as the first one and that's good enough for me. I liked that it was set in London this time. Also, I liked that Kat Dennings got more screen time than the first because I love her to death and she was really funny. Speaking of which, this movie had a lot more laughs and I enjoyed that. It's always good to have stupid little laughs here and there in a serious-ish movie like this one. Just go to the freaking movie, sit back and enjoy the ride. Don't get caught up in ""the dimensions of the characters"" (It's based off comic strip, are you guys serious right now?) I can't imagine a bigger waste of money than going to a movie in theaters and stripping it bare.

We also have some ancient powerful"" enemy which has been defeated aeons ago, when he tried to take over control of the universe, or something like that. Now this enemy is back along with some kind of super-weapon. And our heroes evil brother Loki is also present and continues with his schemes and tricks. Our hero is - as before - invincible and in the end we have big battle on Earth and on the plant of Who-cares-heim. The powerful (read boring and forgettable) enemy is defeated and in the end of the movie we some some hints for things to come in planned sequels. Nothing new.

315,picturetaker,"What on Earth, no Asgard was this?",2,22 November 2013,"I like the first Thor but honestly this one was so boring and predictable that I left the movie theatre tired and incredibly bored. It starts off with a huge battle and that is great. I like battles but it is between the Asgard and the Dark Elves. The dark elves get beaten and thought of as dead. And for some reason Asgard, protector of the nine realms does not really confirm this, they just assume. So an entire millennium passes. Then Natalie Portman is in London. Just like that, for some reason she is in England and then for some reason, just like that in a warehouse is an inter dimensional gate to a dark cave that holds some crazy slimy looking evil ghost like thing, that naturally possesses her sort of. She is still herself but if some touch her they are thrown across the room, while if others touch her they are fine.Well after an hour of this, then finally the Dark Elves attack Asgard, attack London and take the evil from Natalie Portman who survives naturally. Thor does a bunch of punching and tough stares. Loki lies a bunch of times and naturally there is a big alien battle in London and of course Thor saves the day with the help of Natalie Portman and her earthly friends.I honestly found this movie so boring and recycled that I found myself actually wanting to fall a sleep in the theatre. I had such high hopes for this movie because I thought the first one (see my review for it) was pretty good. This one I am not interested in ever seeing again. It is predictable, long and boring.",Thor - The Dark World
316,TheBarleyGuy,"Feels a bit hollow, but looks stunning.",7,15 May 2016,"Well, this one was a long time coming. Somehow I missed this completely in 2013, and so it was inevitable that I got to it. The first Thor was never my favourite, less because of the quality of the film and more because I've never really connected with, or been super interested in Thor as a character.Backstory aside, I was pleasantly surprised by The Dark World. Hemsworth is a charming and charismatic presence, and Tom Hiddleston has such a strong screen presence that it's pretty easy to get through on the two alone. That, coupled with the (almost) unrecognizable Christopher Eccleston (Doctor Who) as Malekith give enough to like in the performances to recommend this one.Honestly, the track record that Marvel studios has for creating entertaining, and quality films is something that almost seems completely unbelievable. At their worst, the movies they put out are thoroughly entertaining, and this entry is far from the worst.One of the most interesting parts of the movie come in the visuals; particularly in the design of the dark elves, and the other realms. There are some really interesting fantasy elements in the movie that almost felt like they could have been Guillermo del Toro designs. There's some of the most interesting visuals and creature design present in this movie that the rest of the MCU just hasn't come close to yet.While it might be easy to doubt this one, especially after director Alan Taylor's most recent work Terminator Genysis, but all in all, Thor: The Dark World is a fun, entertaining ride that offers some solid performance and visuals. It managed to get me excited for the upcoming Thor film, so I guess that's something.",Thor - The Dark World
317,pinkled5,Poor writing and characters,5,30 November 2013,"There are a number of reasons why I found this film to be disappointing, unlike its predecessor which I enjoyed very much.1) Underdeveloped Bad Guy Syndrome: I know almost nothing about the bad guy even after watching the film. A dark elf who wants to blow everything up. Apparently that's all we need to know and all we'll ever know about the main villain in the film.2) Pointless Main Characters: The main characters in this film offer nothing of substance or value. For example, you could have replaced Jane with any other character without affecting the film. She exists solely as plot vehicle. The film does not explore her relationship with Thor, her reaction as a character to being transported to a different world, etc., etc. She's as thin as cardboard, like the rest of the main characters of this film.3) Very Poor Humor: Almost all of the jokes in this film made me roll my eyes and groan. It's as if the script writers liked the humor in Avengers and attempted to duplicate it without any knowledge of how.4) Ridiculous Plot Devices: Things in this movie only happen because the script says they have to. For example, Jane being the one possessed by the dark energy. Or the car keys being discovered on another planet. These things make no sense but exist solely because they have to for the plot to continue. I hate that.I had high hopes for Thor II but in the end it was just another disappointing let down.",Thor - The Dark World

Would surely recommend this for watching.",Thor - The Dark World
319,Sisiutil,"Good for action, but lacking the emotional depth of the first film",7,15 December 2013,"Thor: The Dark World has a lot going for it: charismatic leads, strong supporting characters, lots of great action sequences, and a straightforward story. It's entertaining and is a decent, solid entry in Marvel's cinematic universe.But it could have been so much more. I see in this movie yet more evidence of a troubling habit in Hollywood action films: cutting vital character moments for the sake of inserting more action.The emotional underpinning of the first Thor film was the title character's growing maturity and redemption. In its follow-up, the heart of the film should have been Thor and Jane's growing romance. In particular, we had the opportunity for a compelling love triangle (Thor-Jane-Sif) that would underscore the differences between Asgard and Earth, between making the safe, obvious choice (Sif, the practically-immortal warrior maiden) and the hard, risky one (Jane, the vulnerable, short-lived human). But aside from a few seemingly throwaway lines that hinted at what could have been a much better story, we get none of this. This is a problem, because what is it that's driving Thor in this movie? It's his quest to save the woman he loves, even if it means betraying the realm where he grew up and is destined to rule. At least it's supposed to be, but we never get more than token acknowledgement of Thor's inner struggle--unlike the first film.Instead, what we do get is a pretty standard action movie: seemingly unstoppable bad guys; the stalwart good guy and his spunky love interest; their quirky helpers; clever one-liners; and, of course, action, action, special effects, action. It all holds together well enough, but the first Thor movie had so much more of an emotional foundation. This one feels rushed, as though several important (quiet, emotional) scenes are missing. Apparently some of those will show up on the DVD; I certainly hope so.Marvel should learn not to be afraid of making its movies a little longer. Thor, with his basis in mythology, deserves a big, epic canvas, and if it takes an extra 10-20 minutes or more of screen time to fit in the whole story, then so be it.",Thor - The Dark World

Went with my daughter and we enjoyed it, its obvious a lot of work went into the production. its well worth a watch, a lot of action. We saw it in 3D. I think the thor series will run for a while. Thor is essentially Marvel's answer to Superman and, as with The Man of Steel, it can be difficult to craft a tale around a hero who is essentially invincible. Sometimes you can spend hundreds of millions not to get a great movie, they spent a lot of money on this movie, I think it paid off just about. At the end of the day its fantasy fiction, so you have to judge this movie on its artistic approach and its not bad at that level. I have see far worse movies.",Thor - The Dark World
322,redeyedtree,Humor's the big winner,9,3 November 2013,"Thor: The Dark World has great characters, special effects and decent plot lines but humor was the big winner and at the lead was Kat Dennings. There was drama, action and romance and life and death struggles but these were effectively offset by one-liners and situational comedy without being awkward or detracting. These combined elements made it an all round fun movie to see (in 3d, if you can). There was this wonderful battle between light and dark both in the sets and the characters. Marvel fans must see it but there is enough other enticements to drag along a non-Marvel friend or two. Female presence is strong with Rene Russo, Jaimie Alexander, Kat Dennings and of course Natalie Portman. I know it hasn't come out in the US and I don't want to spoil the fun. Heimdall is a wonderfully complex character even though he has only a fraction of the screen time. As in the first Thor, he is caught between his duty and the greater good. Idris Elba's portrayal of him is one of mystery and sage-like wisdom. Thor's world is rocked but how far? The ending leaves you wondering and hungry for a third.",Thor - The Dark World

326,Dfschohr-532-549658,Thor: The Dark World,7,17 November 2013,"Personally, I feel that all of these superhero movies are getting played out. I was excited and along for the ride just like everyone else when this whole superhero craze started. Now after the Iron Man Trilogy, Captain America, Thor, and The Avengers films have come out out, we can see which hero can truly hold their own movies and which ones should just stay with the group. After the events of Thor and The Avengers, Thor: The Dark World picks up two years after Thor (Chris Hemsworth) left Jane (Natalie Portman) in the first film. Loki (Tom Hiddelston) stands trial for his actions on Earth and is imprisoned. The Dark Elf, Malekith, is resurrected when Jane's body is possessed by the Aether. Thor soon comes back for Jane, bringing her back to Asgard, where Malekith and the Dark Elves wage war to receive the Aether. Chris Hemsworth is and interesting actor, Thor is not the superhero to have his own movie. I'm not a fan of 3D, and I'm especially not a fan of 3D when there are multi-colored buildings and rainbow roads popping out at me, it's brain-numbing. Tom Hiddleston is sensational, I love his character work with Loki, its extremely fascinating and impressive. Natalie Portman, once again is missed place here. She is one of my favorite actresses, but everything falls flat with with her character. I just don't care. Anthony Hopkins does his usual ""Hopkins"" soft, mono-tone whisper, then yells at the top of his lungs. The film definitely has its flaws, but it has a few perks also, a few great fighting sequences and Loki's masterful illusions. I wasn't the biggest fan of the first film, I definitely enjoyed it and have watched it a few times since, I think Thor: The Dark World might be slightly better, but not by much. Alan Taylor, the films director, does a fine job with some of Thor and Loki's fighting sequences but for the most part when its dialogue driven, most scenes fall flat, and the CGI is overwhelming. I give Thor: The Dark World a 7 out of 10.",Thor - The Dark World
327,joris-nightwalker,Yet another Marvel epic,4,22 December 2014,"The Marvel Universe is without any doubt one of those Hollywood hypes I just can't get my head around. What is it that makes people fall in love with those superheroes who are no more than embodiments of the American value-system? And, even more so, why are the bad guys always in business with (semi-)communists, (Arabian) terrorists or evil (Russian or Asian) scientists? The clichés are too much for me. Maybe it's because I'm European. But that doesn't explain why so many Europeans dig this franchise. So maybe it has nothing to do with all that and it's just plain old Hollywood: looking for the greatest common divisor to capitalize on, in other words the best commercial formula for the highest profit. When realizing this it isn't all too bad to watch those Marvel films, 'cause it's only Hollywood numbness and as a viewer you just need to lower yourself to that level. It then also becomes possible to measure those movies against each other. When doing so the pattern - for me - gets quite clear: the second phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy) is way better than the first one (which only had The Avengers that distinguished itself). I'm not anticipating any of the future Marvel films (at least 11 are in the running), but when seeking brainless entertainment, I suppose there's a lot worse out there.",Thor - The Dark World
328,Stefan_Loves_Movies,#Movie Review,7,28 July 2021,"Thor : The Dark World (2013) has its flaws but despite all that it still manages to keep you entertained. The plot seems scattered and over the top, only a few jokes landed, the Ian Boothby & Darcy Lewis combo was not so enjoyable for me. Also you know that something is wrong with the movie if a random servant of evil is actually more interesting and appealing than the movie's villain...

329,Nothinggrandproductions,A fun addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe,8,11 November 2013,"Thor: The Dark World is the 8th installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A universe that is an incredible feat in movie-making. Sure, not all the movies have been mind blowing but that doesn't change the fact that what Marvel/Disney is doing is changing movies, more notably the big blockbuster films. They have these intertwined films in a way that we've never really seen before, it's all one big universejust like a comic book. And I love it. As for this 2nd installment in the Thor franchise, it's pretty good, is it the best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe? No, not really. But, it is certainly an improvement over the 1st film. The movie opens with an opening narration just like the first one about the Dark Elf Malekith who wants to destroy the universe using a weapon named the Aether. This takes place a long time before the days of Odin's rule and involved Odin's father, Bor. Time passes after the Dark Elves have failed and we turn back to Thor in present day. Loki is sent to prison. Thor is lonely but protecting the nine realms. And we have an onslaught of fun action scenes that felt very Lord of the Rings esque which I loved. The Dark Elves are the main villains in this film but they aren't exactly the most interesting which has been a problem in most of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Loki really being the only standout villain out of all the films, at least in my opinion. There is still plenty of great action pieces especially towards the end which rather than being a big, insane fight is slightly more focused and certainly fun. The humor is there, not in The Avengers doses, but it certainly is still there, especially with Loki and Tom Hiddleston doing a great job.I don't expect to go into these movies and get my life changed or be enlightened in some way. I come to have fun. And I certainly did. Is the movie a bit safe? Yeah, it kind of is, it doesn't try to doing anything crazy or even for the most part, impact the Cinematic Universe a whole lot but it still delivers where it needs tobe entertaining. Overall, I don't think I need to be telling you to see the movie because most of you probably already havebut, these are Event Movies and that's truly what I love the most, these have to be seen in theaters with a large crowd who are excited to see it just as much as you are, that's the way to do it.",Thor - The Dark World
330,mephotography2001,Another Great Marvel Blockbuster,9,27 November 2013,"Action, humor, Loki being Loki, Chris Hemsworth took off his shirt for the ladies, and Kat Dennings has officially become my favorite female of the franchise (though I won't watch ""Two Broke Girls""). There was a lot of ""Star Wars"" kinda stuff, but Asgard has usually been described as having technology and medicine beyond our own, so it wasn't hokey. The only thing that I felt was hokey was the after-credits epilogue with The Collector, and considering a high percentage of Marvel movie fans aren't comics readers, it didn't upset most people. For the first time in the new wave of Marvel films it seemed like a cheaply thrown together scene, like a fan-made Star Trek parody, but when you consider how freaking insane the idea of The Collector is in comic book form, this was about as ""real"" as they could make it. And I believe the director admitted it was a last-minute shoot to get that in before next year's ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", so while not being impressed, I was not surprised. Overall, highly recommended.",Thor - The Dark World

336,rsj624,The Dark World Comes Up Just Short,8,26 April 2014,"--WARNING: There may be some spoilers ahead for those who haven't seen the film, so just a heads up. In order to accurately review this film, it may be necessary to talk about some key moments.--Oh, Thor. Thor had won me over with his first feature film. I'd never been a particularly big fan and actually had wasted effort in staying away from the comics as they had zero appeal to me growing up (queue Aquaman here as well). Yet in someway I got around to watching Thor, and here I am having just finished the sequel due to that enjoyable experience...I feel let down, but not angsty or bitter; more or less cheated.Now before going any further I feel it necessary to state that this is a good movie, dare I say a great movie; but I feel some fair warning is needed for those who are unfamiliar with the original film released a few years back. First off, this is not an easy movie to watch if you have not seen the original, and it is very much so a sequel. Second, those who wrote it where clearly aware of the expectations some currently popular actors are now facing as their careers grow. Those who have seen a spike in attention and or have begun to harness a more promising future since the first film's release have seen their roles grow in this film, yet unfortunately to a less organic and much more forced standard. And lastly, it is a blockbuster, much less that of an Iron Man or Avengers blockbuster, and a lot more like what could be considered the bottom rung of the finer Marvel adaptations.With that being said, the story is more or less an episodic occurrence of events that serve as a jumping off point to reunite Thor with Natalie Portman's character, and everything else more or less exists as a way to utilize the popularity of Loki as much as possible. It's not to the point where the film should've been called ""Loki: The Dark World"", but the actual villain is largely forgettable, and the franchise would've most likely benefited more from creating a film centered around a brotherly conflict, rather than make it seem like they're beating around the bush to facilitate tension. It ends up feeling like those involved didn't know how to make the complicated relationship between Thor and Loki exist in a stand alone way, when several original ideas would've been better than the more generic approach they had taken: *Spoiler* Someone dies, Thor and Loki share an interest, Thor and Loki team up...been there dudes *end spoiler*.It just make you want to roll your eyes rather than go 'Yes! I've been waiting for this'. A surprise isn't even needed for this to be a good film, but given the caliber of comic book adaptations these days, I feel like this film was treated much more like a cash in than a genuine attempt to make a great film like its many other marvel contemporaries.No other conflicts or relationships seem really worth mentioning cause no one else ends up feeling even moderately important; they're all just comedy relief in a story that doesn't even feel serious often enough to warrant that. Also, you will see the twist coming from a mile away, and yes it reeks of this cash-in I previously spoke of. It's a beautiful film which goes without saying, as it is easily one of the nicer ones to look at; but to recommend this movie you'd need to be a fan first and foremost. It's fun, but it's fleeting, and it's most likely going to be the more forgettable Thor film in due time.",Thor - The Dark World
337,SugarandIce,Loki: The Dark World,7,9 December 2013,"For the Dark World, eight stars seems a bit high, however seven stars is definitely too low. Let me put the weakest elements of this film out first. Emotionally, this film rarely connects as much as the first film. Thor does not receive any noticeable development. Characters like Siv were underutilized and the villain was forgettable. The comedy dosage is a bit too high as well. In these ways, it falters behind the first movie.In other ways, in most other ways, this film is actually an improvement over the first. It's an all around solid film with good pacing and memorable scenes. I'm sure many people were glad to see a fully powered Thor for so much of the movie. The main attraction though is Loki, who, in tradition, steals all the scenes. In fact, Loki's character is written better than ever in this film. The rest of the movie which is at least good, pales in comparison to any scenes with him. There is a noticeable spike in writing quality when Loki is on screen. Thor is also at his best when interacting with Loki.",Thor - The Dark World
338,jasonpachar,The Light at the End of a Dark World,10,26 June 2014,"When we left our friends in Asgard, all was right in the 9 realms after Loki was thrown into an abyss for his selfish ways and almost destroyed everything the Asgardians hold most dear. But it has been 2 years since Jane Foster and Thor parted ways and now they are reunited because of a darkness that shrouds over Jane's inner body as she infects a most powerful and deadly weapon that could not only destroy her but the entire 9 realms – it takes a vicious monster Malekith (played wonderfully by Christopher Eccleston) to destroy all of the races in the universe to converge it all in darkness.But it takes Thor (Hemsworth) along with Foster (Portman) and Loki (Hiddleston) to save the day. But what we don't know may surprise us – that the Tesseract, the Aether, so close together creates something more deadly than what they could ever even think that could happen to the fate of the entire universe.This movie was excellent and I am looking forward to seeing what is next for our mighty god of thunder.",Thor - The Dark World
339,pegasus-67050,Visually lovely and continues off from the Avengers with some valuable character development,8,9 April 2020,"This movie is certainly not on par with the first Thor film. It is still lovely however. The villain sucks but it's worth watching for Thor & Loki alone. Everyone else is pretty impactless except from Frigga and Heimdall. The acting isn't special apart from some memorable scenes with Thor, Frigga and Loki. Everyone else just doesn't leave an impression.Visually, Asgard is still stunning and is important to the plot of later MCU films (Endgame).The best part of this film in my opinion is Thor & Loki's interactions. Same with the other Thor movies but they also had extra content that actually meant something. I know this seems harsh but this movie is still one of the best fantasy/Thor/Loki/Warrior/Godly/Norse journeys out there!After Loki *dies*, the film is a lot more meaningless to me. He is easily one of the best parts of the film as he provides angst, laughs and some great interactions with his adoptive family. Even the other Asgardians (aka Thor's friends: Sif and the Warriors Three). He's the star of the film besides Thor obviously. Jane is much less interesting of a character than she was in Thor 1. She spent most of the movie possessed by the Aether (aka Reality Stone). Darcy and Erik are still true to their characters which is cool! We need some funner characters (No reason to mention the new 'intern.' He IS meaningless!) Don't get me wrong I love a darker, intense story sometimes (Infinity War/Endgame) but here Thor was extremely serious; To the point of being almost characterless. I love Thor. He was great in Thor 1, The Avengers and Ragnarok but here he was pretty boring. Nonetheless Loki was so cool in this movie as I already said, so at least he livened up the movie where it needed it most.Odin and Heimdall didn't do much except sit on the throne. At least Heimdall got a cool battle scene and helped Thor out of Asgard although it was forbidden by the Allfather. Frigga got a nice scene with Loki. One of the few since all of hi- most of his and Frigga's scenes were deleted :( even though they were *very* important to the plot of first Thor movie but at least those scenes are on the internet (YouTube). :/I didn't mention the soundtrack because in all honesty I don't remember it at ALL even though I've seen the movie at least five times. The soundtrack in Thor 1 was beautiful and emotional Even the Ragnarok soundtrack is more memorable than this film's one. I'm sure there is some nice music in this movie. It just doesn't - you guessed it, leave an impact.Overall a decent movie with good storytelling, amazing visuals and some awesome character interaction! :D.",Thor - The Dark World
340,jacobmeyerjkm,What the hell?,4,8 February 2020,"This was made when Marvel movies were really hit or miss, and this was one of the last misses before Age of Ultron. They made almost all of the characters unlikeable and the villain? I don't remember his name let alone his morals or motivations. Just another forgettable superhero movie that no one really asked for. If you're gonna have a movie be forgettable, at least make it fun in the moment, y'know?",Thor - The Dark World
341,filmfanperspective,The Cough Syrup of Destiny!! (**1/2),5,5 May 2015,"It wasn't that long ago that I remember the deep feeling of appreciation for Marvel as they delivered on their promise. After all, ""The Avengers"" was the Hollywood rarity- a film that audiences were asked to be patient for, and for all intents and purposes, the hype was well-justified. Going forward, we know ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is coming in 2015, and ""The Avengers 3″ in 2018. These immense upcoming films will follow the same pattern as the first, in that a series of individual films will set up the events to culminate in the team-up. I'm fine with that, but I do require Marvel to maintain their focus with these solo efforts. ""Thor: The Dark World"" is a very good looking movie that doesn't pay off in the most disappointing way- it doesn't respect its own audience, and thus becomes a huge missed opportunity for Marvel.If you've seen ""Thor"" and ""The Avengers"", you know that the 'Bifrost' and 'rainbow bridge' were destroyed, Loki (Hiddleston) is going back to Asgard and prison, and that Thor (Hemsworth) returned to Earth, but without visiting Jane Foster (Portman). These issues will need to be addressed in this film, and they are (mostly). After ""Thor"" made a big deal about the destruction of the Bifrost and its implications, nothing is said about how it was repaired in such short time (2 years). I suppose that is of little consequence in the big scheme of events. Loki still plots away in his Asgardian prison cell, apparently not humbled by his convincing defeat. He still feels entitled to a throne (any throne will do). The astrophysicist Jane Foster, as Heimdall (Elba) tells us in the first film, still searches for a way to reach Thor through the path of science. For as little time as they had together in the first film, clearly the Prince of Asgard and the Earth-bound, mortal scientist formed a strong connection- something this film doesn't spend enough time extrapolating. These characters will do anything for each other, but I've struggled to buy into their bond; after all, they haven't been on a single date, haven't shared their feelings or intentions to each other, and haven't shared a bed (that we're aware of). Other than a few longing glances, what is it about these two characters that make their actions believable or justified?Dr. Foster is working out of London in this film- luckily for her, that happens to be the EXACT location (Tanzania was apparently too remote) of a magnificent quantum space event is taking place. The 'Nine Realms' of the universe are all aligning at once, and this 'convergence' apparently allows for easy travel amongst the many branches of existence. As the movie tells us, an artifact of a sinister nature (of course) was hidden a long time ago during the last convergence, and wouldn't you know it- our favorite senator from Naboo (oops, wrong film) stumbles upon it. Literally.This artifact, designed by Malekith (Eccleston) of the ancient race of beings known as Dark Elves, looks exactly like angry Dimetapp to me. According to the movie, it's darkness as a weapon. So, Dr. Foster gets 'infected' by this substance, and becomes slightly dangerous to others. Except Thor. On top of that, the dormant Dark Elves are reawakened across the universe by Jane's interaction with the gooey Robitussin. I'm still confused by these things, but this film isn't interested in explaining away that kind of logic.Doesn't it seem like a grave misstep by the all-powerful Odin and the mighty Thor to have this weapon in the heart of their kingdom? Granted, Thor does have a plan to save her, but by then the Dark Elves have come a calling on Asgard, with technology that is at least 9,000 years old but makes the modern Asgardian defense seem obsolete. That perfectly encapsulates the problems with this movie; we've established a feasible, grounded-in-reality 'Thor-verse' to work with, and this film just craps all over those very rules. I also wondered where the entire population of Asgard was the first film gave us a bustling, populated kingdom, but when Dark Elves attacked, I only remember seeing soldiers and royalty. Did I miss something, or did the filmmakers get lazy?I should counter by saying that this isn't a bad film- it is earnest, and funny at times. It simply seems to have forgotten its audience as well as what made the other films in the 'Avengers' pantheon work, which is what bothers me. After sitting through five set-up films before ""The Avengers"", producer and Marvel film chief Kevin Feige should know better than to allow a film like this to go through- one that treats the established audience like amateurs. It's a rushed, heavily edited (it appears), logic-defying action spectacle that lacks the emotional resonance of the first film and defies the established logic we were used to. Is it possible that there is a better edition of this film out there, or that director Alan Taylor (of 'Game of Thrones' fame) had a grittier, longer version in mind? With the film clocking in at 111 minutes, and with rumors about studio-directed reshoots earlier this past year, I can't help but wonder if those interested in dollar signs saw a bleaker, longer film at first and got scared enough to ask for changes (or mandate changes). I'm clearly speculating, but if that's the case, shame on them. Shame on them anyways for giving us an inferior film.",Thor - The Dark World
342,Spencer-Staggs,Definitely Not The Best MCU Film,7,29 January 2021,"I've been rewatching all the Marvel Cinematic Universe films recently, and Thor: The Dark World is my most recently finished. Although this movie isn't the best MCU film, I still think it's worth the watch. Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skargard, etc. are all great in the film, but I think where the film goes wrong is with it's villain. I believe that they should have given more character development than they gave him. We don't know why he originally wanted the Aether other than him wanting power. The other qualities of the film are just fine. Most of the humor lands, and the CGI/special effects are great.My rating: 6.75/10",Thor - The Dark World

All the characters were so superficial and one dimensional that I did not care in the least what happened to any of them. Apparently the entire universe was at risk, and this film managed to make that prospect completely boring and leave the viewer 100% indifferent about the outcome. Impressive.There were a few attempts at humor thrown into the movie. They were all childish...they failed...and in fact were so ""unfunny"" they made me cringe.About Thor. How interesting is a character who is apparently entirely omnipotent....? Near as I can tell, he can neither be hurt nor killed....and can travel the universe at more than the speed of light. Yawn. I have enjoyed Natalie Portman in many films...but even she could not contribute anything useful to this turd.Having said all this...as of this writing this movie has a 7.6 IMDb rating.

344,BharatSamra,"Not Thorful, But Not Thorsome Either",6,22 December 2013,"Thor: The Dark World expands on the beloved Marvel Cinematic Universe, quite literally, this time with one of the least exciting Avengers taking the spotlight for Hammertime.Despite the devoted fan-base of this incredible world of Marvel superheroes, you can't help but feel that Thor: The Dark World is the first instalment in the franchise to feel most contrived and out of place. Yet, this sequel is still a mild improvement on its predecessor, though together they combine for the weakest in the series of superhero films, even though Thor is probably the strongest out of the bunch. The film finds Thor doing his thing in Asgard, before his lady love Jane Foster conveniently stumbles upon a weapon known as the Aether, which the Dark Elf Malekith intends to use to destroy the universe. Asleep yet?Negativity aside, Thor: The Dark World is a mostly enjoyable comic-book flick with some superb action, actors and, I can't think of another word that begins with 'a' so, humour.For an incredibly cheesy character, Chris Hemsworth still has the oh my demigod factor to bring a great balance of confidence, charisma and physicality to the role of Thor. This can be said of all of the Asgardians, including Anthony Hopkins as Odin and Tom Hiddleston's fan- favourite portrayal of Loki. While narratively Thor: The Dark World is predominantly yawn-inspiring, the presence of Hiddleston's Loki compensates as fans are genuinely interested to see his current personality and relationship with Thor following the events of The Avengers in 2012. It is the human characters that are the dull, annoyingly cheesy and unnecessary obstacles that often get in the way of the overall pleasant 112 minute sequel. Notably, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is used as a pathetic damsel in distress signal masquerading as a character with any significance, while Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) is pretty much the idiotic joke machine waiting for her cue. These characters, along with the contrived villain Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) are really the Aether to what could have been a very promising second outing for Thor. With no disrespect to these actors whom deliver fine performances, it is their characters that suppress absolute enjoyment of Thor: The Dark World.Apologies for this tennis match I am having with myself in complementing and then hammering Thor: The Dark World's qualities; still I'll continue to play. More positively, the film is possibly the greatest comedic achievement for the superhero squadron on screen to date. One moment had the audience in an uproar of laughter; those that have seen it will know the moment, and those that are yet to see the film will know when they bear witness to its hilarity. Even during other scenes where the humour feels slightly inappropriate given the circumstances, you'll easily yield with laughter, or at the minimum, a low-key grin.It's almost superfluous today to commend a modern blockbuster for its CGI quality. However due to its stark visual improvement over its 2011 predecessor, Thor: The Dark World is certainly worth mentioning as an aesthetically potent force which makes the movie a Thorful lot of fun!Whilst the Thorsome Asgardian actors, humour and visual effects are enough to keep Marvel fans entertained for two short hands around the clock, it doesn't take too long to realise that Thor: The Dark World is probably the most forgettable and forced in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, though by no means the first for Marvel (I'm looking at you 'Amazing' Spider-Man). Thor's lack of character development since the end of Thor, along with the villain out of nowhere and no care Malekith make this sequel feel pretty purposeless in the grander scheme of things. And that's not even mentioning Jane Foster: Marvel's version of Daphne from Scooby-Doo, except more pointless, boring, unconvincing and no fun for anyone.After a Thortless and needlessly dull opening 45 minutes, Thor: The Dark World has plenty of surprises along the way to amuse the fandom inside of devotees, that'll shadow its flaws until you really start to think about the film, but it's some fun while it lasts.",Thor - The Dark World
345,Hassan_Scarborough,Go see it!!! A movie review without a lot of spoilers,8,7 November 2013,"This was a fantastic film and I'm not a big Thor fan. Best action Sci-fi film of the year by far. I saw Man of Steel and this was way better. This film is a lot more diverse than most(if not all) of the films that came out this year. The directing was fantastic, cinematography top notched. Did I mention I wasn't a big Thor fan?One thing to bare in mind. Now, when I went to see this I was expecting a geek fest, but instead it was a girl fest of women who wanted simply to see Chris Hemsworth. So for the die hard comic book fan, just bare in mind there are going to be a lot of young women swooning in the theater. If you think Natalie Portman is sexy, then your in for a treat. No flesh is exposed but you'll get to gaze at that pretty face throughout the film.It's got everything.Love story, family saga, action, some of the best special effects, and even comedy.

346,Big_D_Box_Office_Score,Loki steals the show!!!,9,8 November 2013,"The Marvel Studios movie universe dominates the super-hero movie genre right now. And how have they done it? By NOT making super-hero movies.Stay with me here...Marvel Studios has made it a point to make action-genre movies, that just happen to have their super-heroes in them. Iron Man? Action/sci-fi. Captain America 1? Action/war themed. Cap 2? Action/espionage/political thriller. Guardians of the Galaxy? Action/space opera. Thor 1 and 2? Action/fantasy. The point being, if Thor didn't have ""Thor"", the Marvel comic character, but just some random big dude with a hammer, the movie still works as an action/fantasy movie. IF YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE MYTHOLOGY OF THE COMICS, YOU CAN STILL ENJOY THIS MOVIE JUST AS MUCH AS ANYONE. You can't really say that to the same extent when it comes to the Batman or Man of Steel movies. Marvel's got it down to a science, and you gotta give it up to them for that.That being said, let's get into specifics...""Thor: The Dark World"" could have easily been called ""Thor: LOKI WILL RULE YOU"". Tom Hiddleston, by far and away, steals this movie, and leaves you wanting so much more. Fun fact: A few months ago, they actually called Hiddleston back to the studio to shoot additional scenes with Loki, due to popular demand. And it was well worth it. Sure, there are other actors in this movie, but really...LOKI.I think that what Hiddleston is doing with Loki is, at the very least, on par with what Heath Ledger did with The Joker. Of course, Ledger's Joker is at the top of the pile when it comes to movie super-villainy, but Hiddleston is right at that level, and he's doing it with a character that, up until the past couple of years, wasn't nearly as well known. LOKI.The scenes without Loki are alright too. Chris Hemsworth makes a good Thor, Idris Elba can do no wrong, Natalie Portman is tolerable, Anthony Hopkins owns Odin, and Kat Dennings is adorable. And they all make great bridges from one Loki scene to the next.Wait, Loki isn't the main villain here? There's someone else? That's crazy...I didn't really notice that other guy, because LOKI.All jokes aside, this is just a great, well written, fun time at the movies. 3D isn't necessary for this, BUT Marvel sweetened the deal by adding an extended 5+ minute trailer for Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier to the 3D screenings, which includes a pretty great fight scene. So, 2D or 3D is really your call.Thor: The Dark World earns a 4.25 out of 5 on the BDBOS. Well done.STAY THROUGH THE CREDITS!!! There are TWO bonus scenes to stick around for, one halfway through the credits (!), and a 2nd scene at the end.(Hey guys, thanks for reading my review, hope you enjoyed it.

The one that would suck you out of thin air and crushed you into a small ball into hell. Some sort of a black hole kinda thing, which disappear after erasing someone from the world.The acting was great, though the human team looked like they were acting for TV shows instead for a movie. But maybe that was what the director intended. Light and entertaining. Especially Darcy and the new intern's interaction, also the newly-turned-crazy Sweden scientist.Portman was as beautiful as ever, but that was all from her performance.Rene Russo was more impressive, an eloquent fighter queen, one that was too fine to watch.The directing though, with the connection between worlds idea, showed how oh-so-Godly the director was.Totally unpredictable. That was how Alan Taylor's imagination was not making sense as ever, yeah, the good guys shall win in the end. How ever too-lucky-to-be-real the process was.The Asgardian team was not exploited as much as in the first Thor, for which I exhaled in relief. I didn't like them being the centre of the story too much. Those characters as a group weren't as interesting as Odin versus Malekith dialogues.The tricks and treats, that was how good I felt the directing and editing was. I felt tricked yet as good as getting a treat. Some of your predictions weren't always turned out right.Go watch it! They said the 3D was showing a great effect as well!",Thor - The Dark World
349,Shad_Critic,Another Improvement,7,28 April 2015,"Thor The Dark World is good. Definitely an improvement to the first one. It had more action, its storyline was more interesting and the special effects were great. Marvel did a good job again on making movies. The storyline was interesting because of the new characters and the new worlds.It also gave us some new characters that are likable in a way. Another thing I liked in this movie is that it'll make you hyped from its coolness. Yes, there may be boring parts but those only takes a while.In conclusion, Thor The Dark World is good. It was such a satisfying movie. Now, I really can't wait its next sequel Thor Ragnarok.",Thor - The Dark World
350,svr-2200,Thor The Dark World is visually dazzling and impressive with some epic visual effects and action scenes that are delight to watch.,7,26 September 2017,"Thor The Dark World: Movie Review. Thor The Dark World is an visually epic and entertaining superhero Marvel film with some enjoyable performances delivered by Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston. The movie looks good visually and has some great action sequences. The action sequences are stunning and outstanding.The main story plot is very unconvincing.The villains and negative characters of the movie are very under developed and the movie suffers from these underdevelopment of characters that somewhat stop the movie from being a epic masterpiece in terms of story plots and negative characters. Some scenes and sub plots seems to overloaded with dull and boring screenplay and feels uninteresting. The humour is good but feels forced at some times and there are few unnecessary characters with make the movie underwhelming and irritating. But, there were lots of better enjoyable and redeeming moments and surprising good action visual elements, with better pacing, some strong solid better acting and even some actually interesting scenes that makes Thor: The Dark World an enjoyable visually stunning Marvel Movie worth to watch.(Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others.

Thor (Chris Hemsworth), who has been away from astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) for two years, dealing with instability across the Nine Realms, returns to Asgard. Then Jane chances upon an anomaly that brings back the Aether, a mysterious force that once threatened Asgard and has awakened its long-time enemies, the Dark Elves, who are out for blood. Meanwhile, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), is languishing in prison, awaiting his next chance at glory.""Thor: The Dark World"" is MCU's worst movie ever. The character of the movie is not defined. Looks like you know this character but don't understand character traits. The movie was not strong enough like THOR's first movie. CGI and VFX were good. They did not even describe the characteristics of the villain character Malekith. I think the new character should have been further defined but they didn't.It is the worst movie of MCU.",Thor - The Dark World
353,coy_dog0,A surprisingly good movie.,6,13 November 2013,"A good story told at a measured pace. Not a masterpiece, but probably the only Marvel Studios movie since Iron Man 1 that approaches being a 'great' movie (though its not there yet).A lot of Star Wars imagery, from the design of the ships to the framing of the shots; when the 'Alien Elves' erupt out of that hole thing, it feels like the opening of A New Hope! This could be my favourite Marvel Studios movie after Iron Man 1.I hope Marvel continues in this direction, but let the directors have MORE control, more vision and more passion.A very entertaining blockbuster, but the next one will be better.http://www.comicbooksyndicate.com/thor-the-dark-world/",Thor - The Dark World
354,ramkoil,We walked out,1,22 February 2014,"We very seldom walk out of a movie, but to us our time is worth more than the cost of any movies. This move was bland one dimensional, and with no character that you could care for. The girl that was suppose to be Portmans assistance was utterly pointless and annoying. To top this there was an assistant to her, this man was even dumber than her. I think it has become an sport to make male characters with no spine and brain in Hollywood movies, it makes the feminist happy. Back to the movie, 30 minutes through we were literally falling sleep, so looked at each other and just left. There is no plot that can have anything remotely to do with any possible laws of physics, anything goes. No characters to relate to, and special effects well, there are explosions that is all.

355,AkelaLoneWolf,Loki steals the show again - Marvel needs to work on its plot,6,21 June 2014,"Although Thor, the namesake of the movie series, is masculinity incarnate; there is little doubt that the audience is not really impressed by the hammer brandishing deity - likely because Thor pales in comparison whenever the arch villain Loki makes an appearance. Perhaps one should congratulate Marvel on the success of creating this charismatic evil character who even dominates The Avengers, not to mention the spawning of countless fanfiction and secondary creation. Marvel needs to work on the storyline as it is stretching thin, what is the remote probability of all this new dark energy targeting Thor's ladylove as a host, out of zillions of beings to choose from the vast universe with the nine realms? The plot feels flimsy to begin with, and though the brilliant coup and contracoup actions by the brothers near the end are exciting, the actual final scene is an inevitable anticlimax and seems like child's play. The only solace being the hint of yet another sequel - with our favorite villain it, of course.",Thor - The Dark World
356,newguy85,Midgardian Mind Getting Overwhelmed,8,15 November 2013,"With the score of Marvel movies out now in essentially the same universe, the directors ask a lot from the viewers. Before seeing this my wife and I watched Thor 1, thinking it would catch us up, but we both forgot about The Avengers, and looked at each other confused when Loki was brought to Odin in handcuffs. We also both had to think about what the characters meant when they talked about a god taking over Selvig's mind... Basically, the movie gives you zero help in remembering why things are the way they are, so I'd recommend watching Thor and Avengers first before checking this out.I loved the way the movie looked and flowed, but there were a lot of ""well it's a movie"" plot turns, and the plot itself seemed strait out of Start Trek: an alien race is dormant after being conquered and their power source taken away, the power source is found and awakens them, they seek to bring the universe to their status-quo. That being said, the art design was fantastic for the Dark Elves and for Asgard, kudos, and there were some seriously LOL moments that seem to be a trademark for Marvel to keep their movies out of the realism that DC is trying for.It was fun and enjoyable and again Marvels has a winner... but I would stress to the viewer, there is required viewing of at least the Avengers to know what the hell is going on.8 out of 10",Thor - The Dark World
357,Dory_Darko,MARVELously entertaining.,9,9 November 2013,"Watching Thor: The Dark World tonight, I got the feeling that Hollywood might have finally gotten the hang of it. In theory, a sequel should always surpass its predecessor, although as we all know, many have tried and famously failed. But a new trend seems to finally be breaking through. X2 was better than X-Men. Spider-Man 2 was better than the first. And now that I've seen it, I can tell you Thor: The Dark World is better than Thor. (And the fact that these are all Marvel productions, that's food for anther discussion.)I thoroughly enjoyed Thor, directed by Kenneth Branagh, when I only saw it for the first time just this spring. In fact, I watched it again the same week. Which is saying enough to imply that my hopes were high for the sequel. So I was really looking forward to tonight and I was not disappointed.Thor 2 was helmed by a different director, Alan Taylor, which typically always spells trouble in my book when they change the director, but I take my hat off to him. What I admire is that he managed to capture the tone that Branagh set in the first film flawlessly – even perfected it in a way. He brings to the table a duality which almost never works successfully in any film, but here, does so perfectly: Taylor made Thor 2 notably darker, yet at the same time more humorous. I take my hat off to the writers as well – they put in a ton of great jokes, all at the exactly right moment. Had this been done even a fraction less tactfully, the film would have sunk like a bag of bricks, like so many others have. I found myself (and the audience) laughing my butt off one moment, and feeling very serious and engaged with the on-screen emotions the next. Even when it happened abruptly, it still never felt inappropriate. Now that's good entertainment. Two thumbs up.The actors all wear their roles like a custom- made suit. It's obvious that Chris Hemsworth has really grown into his character, third time around. This guy IS Thor, hands down. The same goes for all the other actors, they were all perfectly comfortable in their roles and respective environments. The one that intrigued me most, however, was Loki – personified absolutely magnificently by Tom Hiddleston. Much like Hemsworth, it seems he was born to play this role. He captures all the slyness, all the arrogance and all the torment of a man almost unable to bear the weight of his own ego in a single flicker in his eyes. And then that grin Perfection. The way Hiddleston plays Loki is strangely captivating. You know he's totally wicked and cannot be trusted, yet at the same time you can't help but really like him – you might even end up rooting for this guy, and I'm not sure many other actors would have managed this.All the special effects were as good as one should expect them to be these days. I have nothing much to say there, except that it was all terrifically eye-pleasing, and Asgard looked even more beautiful than before. It was all convincing and very well done. Still, I have not completely explained why T:TDW is better than the first. Actually, I might not fully be able to. It's mostly a feeling. As much as I was entertained the first time, I was even more entertained now. It was more action-packed, more exciting, darker and it just had a great deal more adrenaline. The only thing that I think was weaker in this film, was the character of Jane Foster. Her character was just less interesting, kind of blank. I actually don't remember much of her at all, except that she slapped Thor a couple of times and she had all this creepy stuff coming out of her Also she was somewhat of a damsel-in- distress most of the time with the look of a scared kitten on her face, and that's not exactly how we like to see our ladies nowadays. It's so common to see women being perfectly independent now, that it's a little weird to see a grown woman with ""three degrees in physics"" (as Darcy so poignantly points out) scared and shivering like a little girl. Most of the time, Natalie Portman just didn't carry her scenes very strongly, and that's strange coming from such a fine actress. So maybe one of the actors was actually a little out of place after all, thinking about it. Having said that, that's pretty much my only complaint. Every other element in this film was very solid, the story was very good and they absolutely nailed the pacing. Those two hours went by in the blink of a eye. Thor: The Dark World is wonderfully entertaining and a definite must-see for every Marvel fan. In fact – at the risk of enraging the Marvel Gods – this might just be pretty stiff competition to X-Men Watch out Wolverine, I think I have a new favorite superhero.",Thor - The Dark World
358,tuhin94,"A vast improvement, but with a lot of room left for more",8,23 April 2014,"First and foremost, I am sad to say that the sequel did not top the original as thoroughly as has been put forth as a general consensus. If anything, they have used elements from the first Thor and simply added a new villain. But, that is breaking it down to its very core element and does not do the film justice. As is expected with big budget superhero movies these days, the special effects were simply flawless and beautiful. The sound guys also worked their magic. The actors (reprising and new) did a terrific job pulling us into the fictional ""Earth"", Asgard, and Svartalfheim. Thor, Jane, Odin, Loki, and all the lead characters impress just like they did in 2011. As the baddies, Malekith and his Dark Elves are quite a force to be reckoned with. They were not the types to have a nice meal with. And I liked that quite a lot. Thor was challenged and almost killed on multiple occasions instead of defeating them with a swing and a shock. And Kurse? Now that's a right-hand man a tough baddie like Malekith needs! The fight of the century between him and Hulk would rake in chests upon chests. The little fusses I made for its duration added up, however. For example, Loki's body was simply left behind by Thor. Of course, we discover later that Loki was not killed, but is it not an insult to not bring Loki back to Asgard? And there was a lot of unnecessary dialog intended to pass off as comic relief, but was only obtuse. Things like, ""I better get my pants."" And why would the students in the library not have run away like the rest of their peers right outside when Malekith's ship crashed down instead of making Thor's fight a big celebrity photo shoot? Finally, some of the scenes were not needed, like Selvig's nude terrorism story on the news being shown twice and the double history lesson that could have been summarized into one that was slightly shorter. All in all, entertainment at every step. Watched 04/23/2014, written 04/24/2014.",Thor - The Dark World
359,SforSmile,A lighthearted Rehash.,6,1 November 2013,"The blithe and action-filled sequel to the solid and surprisingly interesting ""Thor"" from 2011, never quite unfolds the necessary emotional depth that would make you truly care for the characters as there is no character development like in the first part where the all shiny thunder god Thor made a remarkable transformation from an arrogant bully into a responsible hero whereas now he appears to be a rather one-dimensional beau who is good for some stunning stunts and few cool lines; with his roguish brother Loki as a welcome exception since his ambiguous motives have a sort of lurking sensation to them even though he is slowly turning into a Roly-Poly doll whose tricks are getting old.The rag rug of a plot is too unoriginal and therefore too predictable to be really suspenseful in spite of some more or less contrived twists. It's the ever same ""Capture the Flag""-formula, where the hero needs to wrest a ""Holy Grail""-like magical stone from the enemy's greedy claws in order to save the world, that we have not just recently seen in too many movies before; whether it's called ""Tesseract"", ""Allspark"" or like in this case ""Aether"", it may be a somewhat necessary plot device that brings forward the action, however, if it remains like here the only impetus, the only sense without a deeper meaning, without a humane message, then it is too little and trite to have a lasting impact. Nowadays, every episode of ""Game of Thrones"" offers much more excitement and drama than many a Blockbuster I've seen in recent years.What's missing plot-wise is compensated with great visuals and nearly breathtaking action sequences that come along as a Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings meets Viking mythology crossover fantasy/science-fiction mash-up which is definitely a plus. The invasion of Asgaard by the Dark Elves strongly resembles the great Battle on Naboo in ""Star Wars: Episode I"" especially since Bambi-eyed Nathalie Portman plays the dame in distress in both movies. The chemistry between her role Jane Foster and Thor is good although their kisses lack the fiery passion we saw in Spiderman for example; much more touching love stories have been told than this one for sure.""Thor: The Dark Kingdom"" is at least nice to look at.",Thor - The Dark World
360,neazy,Soulless,4,10 September 2017,"Whilst this film is not entirely dreadful, it commits a sin perhaps even worse - it is dull. An uninspired story, formulaic dialogue, and a raft of meaningless characters conspire to make this the worst entry in the Avengers franchise. The last criticism is the most serious - for a film that sets itself up from the first as a battle of the ages between light and dark, the dark is disappointingly, well, opaque. Christopher Ecclestone's considerable talents are utterly wasted as the wooden, one-dimensional and frankly utterly uninteresting Malekith, and the lack of a genuinely characterful or menacing villain cripples the film entirely. He is an empty shell of a character, especially viewed against the beguiling mischievousness of Loki, and it makes the rest of the story, try as it might, a disappointingly run-of-the-mill blockbuster smash fest.The film generally hangs together as an overall effort - the visuals are OK, the acting reasonable, the story, bar some curious leaps even of in-world logic, and some predictably silly plot points, is solid enough for it to be not unwatchable. But there is no spark, nothing to generate enthusiasm, not enough meaningful drama to develop engagement and attachment. Unfortunately, therefore, it is utterly forgettable.",Thor - The Dark World
361,benjamincallinicos,"A good follow-up that unfortunately suffers from pacing issues, annoying subplots and a wasted villain",6,26 October 2018,"This sequel does improve upon the first Thor film, but barely.However the same pacing issues do apply to this film and the whole art direction and tone is just dark, ugly and plain dull.The only things that save this film are the performances of Hemsworth, Portman, Hiddleston and Eccleston (although he is wasted in the film).It's bogged down by subplots with annoying characters who are meant to be comic relief. The only one that actually worked was Selvig's who's mind had been warped by Loki's sceptre in the Avengers (good continuity!)But the subplot with Chris O'Dowd as Jane's date, and Darcy along with her quirky intern, Ian, that was unnessary and tedious as Darcy was a character from the first Thor film who I never really cared for. Nothing against the actress playing her, though.On the whole, this is one of Marvel's weakest movies and it was a huge slog to get through as the story didn't intrigue me. It's boring in places, trust me.",Thor - The Dark World
362,zaidmnomani,A Big Pile of Nothing,4,5 June 2020,"A while ago I watched all the marvel movies in the MCU. For the most part, the films range from mediocre to actually pretty good. Thor 2 might be the only one that I disliked. To be clear, I don't have strong feelings towards this movie at all. It's just dull to watch.The acting isn't bad, but none of the actors add anything to their roles. Natalie Portman has proven that she can be great, but in this movie she is just annoying. Her character is the stereotypical love interest who's there because studios think you have to have a girlfriend in every superhero movie. No wonder Natalie Portman decided to skip out on Thor 3.Chris Hemsworth himself has said that he does not like this movie, and it's easy to see why. Thor has no arc in this film at all, and nothing unique or interesting that makes a character gripping. The only thing in this movie that could have been emotional was his mother's death. The problem is, Thor has never had a proper relationship with his mother, and the audience is never given a reason to care about her death. Even Thor does not seem to care that his mother died. He's a bit sad but gets over it in a couple of minutes.The film tries to give the side characters some personality, but I still struggle to remember their names. Most of them are the comic relief sidekicks, and that's the extent of their role in the film. The main villain, Maliketh, is about as bad as a villain you can get in a superhero movie. He want's to take over the universe for no reason, check. He is after some MacGuffin, check. He has a completely uninteresting design and voice, check. The actor who played Maliketh said that he hated the role, and had no idea what his character was supposed to be.Then there's the other two side characters. Kat Dennings and Stellen Skarsguard. Kat Dennning's character is another annoying comic relief. Eric Selvig went from wise old man to crazy old man in between the films. The first shot of him in the film is him naked in front of live TV, which I guess is supposed to be a joke.The plot is also extremely by the numbers. Nine planets will align and the bad guy will use the MacGufffin to destroy the world, blah blah blah. Then Thor shows up just in the nick of time to save the world with the help of Natalie Portman and then learns some lesson. The end. It's also utterly pointless in the story of the MCU. Just read the Wikipedia plot summary and you'll get about the same amount of enjoyment as you would if you actually watched the film.",Thor - The Dark World

While I don't agree to that, it could've been a lot better. And perhaps it would've been better if Marvel just let Patty Jenkins do her thing. Nonetheless, the action and acting is pretty good, but the comedy is just cringe. The jokes just do not fit the dark nature of this film, which is something Marvel Studio's improved on in Thor: Ragnarok.",Thor - The Dark World
364,khfan250,"A Welcome Addition to ""Phase 2"" to the Marvel Cinematic Universe!",8,24 April 2014,"Last summer's ""Iron Man 3"" turned out to be very disappointing, but ""Thor: The Dark World"" does a much better job of kicking off this second phase of Marvel movies. I did enjoy the first ""Thor"", but this movie does a much better job of exploring some of the other worlds and raising the stakes.The original cast returns for this second film and they are great! Chris Hemsworth is still a great Thor and Tom Hiddleston really gets a chance to shine as Loki. Natalie Portman is still hot and plays a good Jane Foster. The rest of the original cast is good, also, though I really wish that Kat Dennings was not in these movies because she's annoying and pretty pointless. Christopher Eccleston is Malekith, the new villain for the film. He's a bit boring and is honestly pretty forgettable, which is a shame because Eccleston really is a good actor.The story for this movie is very fun. No, it doesn't always make sense, but like other successful Marvel movies, it keeps you entertained and wanting more. The film also does a much better job at foreshadowing ""Avengers 2"" than ""Iron Man 3"" did, so that's an added bonus that all fans should look forward to.The effects are sort of hit and miss. Asgard and the other realms that are shown look spectacular. The action sequences are well choreographed and make for an exciting time. But some of the costumes look a bit silly and fake.Final verdict: ""Thor: The Dark World"" is exactly what it is meant to be. It is an entertaining thrill ride from start to finish, with good characters and great, action packed scenes. It is not a great Marvel movie like ""Iron Man"" or ""The Avengers"", but it is a worthy entry that will leave you entertained and wanting to see it again.",Thor - The Dark World

366,jimbowclock,Thor: The Dark Mess,6,10 June 2019,"Thor the dark world is by far the goofiest of the marvel films thus far. Also the most head scratching. It makes you wonder what they were trying to achieve and what was the point. It's a mishmash of all fantasy franchises before, themes of lord of the rings, star wars, game of thrones, and even pirates of the Caribbean. Its shot very dark with amazing looking villains who look extra evil. Irritatingly not used to their full potential. Being so dark they also shoehorn out of place humor that is confusing and mostly misses its mark. This film also has some of the best visuals and effects in the entire marvel universe. Loki is also at his best. Its wacky, goofy, and a complete mess. I recommend on the grounds to watch in awe. The worst of the marvel films to this point, but still worth sticking around for the odd unique mess it was. Oh, and confusing plot holes galore. 60%",Thor - The Dark World
367,keithbrown-90195,The Dullest MCU Movie,4,18 September 2016,"I really enjoyed the first Thor. It was actually probably my favorite of Marvel's phase one films. The mixture of high Asgardian fantasy mixed well with the fish out of water humor on Earth. I'm sure having Kenneth Branagh in the director's chair certainly helped. He has a good touch for switching between high drama and light humor.The Dark World arrived at a time when Marvel needed to build its larger universe's ultimate conflict. As a result of this, the antagonists in this movie feel undercooked and nonthreatening. Maybe its their designs, which look alarmingly low budget, but they are maybe the weakest villains yet in the MCU.There was ripe opportunity here to make it a personal threat, where Jane's life was legitimately at stake. But the human element of the Marvel movies always plays second fiddle to the spectacle, and this story line is no more than a brief distraction until we get to the ships colliding into cities and CGI explosions.I actually quite enjoyed the climax of the movie, which is usually not the case for these. There's always a light comic touch to the Earth scenes in these Thor movies, and they thankfully continue that trend even during scenes of mass destruction. It's nice to see Thor asking for directions on the Underground, or confused office workers witness two supernatural beings slide down their window in agony. While not exciting for a story point of view, it was entertaining. Plus, I really liked Natalie Portman's red rainboots.It's too bad then that I was really not a fan of the first 75 minutes, where much of the action needs to be explained to us for it to have any weight, and then for the action to be middling at best. I don't know if it's Alan Taylor or what, but his Terminator film was just as generic and dull as this felt for a good long while.Mildly enjoyable in the end, but a forgettable entry in the grand scheme of things.",Thor - The Dark World
368,gurubesar,Amazing CGI,7,15 December 2013,"One thing for sure about this movie is the CGI. It is quite impressive and amazing. A lot of effort has been put to make this movie a good science fiction movie. However, as in most of the science fiction movie or the stories from Marvel. there is always the nagging thing which bothers me. In the set up where the character is using laser gun or whatever they call it, there is still some army who is fighting with a sword, lance and using shield. This does not really making any sense. If they could create something weapon of laser class, why would they fight using a sword ? And to make it worse, the party with the sword is actually beating the guy with the gun. I know this is science-fiction and movie is an imagination of something, but can it be made with more sense ? Another detail which I find a bit annoying is the ""politically correct"" selection of characters. This is a story of Nordic god. I have nothing against the African American people, but does it make sense to see one of the God portrayed by a black guy ? It does not matter how good the acting of this particular person, but he is so out of place in the environment of Nordic setting. Maybe for once; drop the ""politically correct"" attitude and do something for the benefit of the art...",Thor - The Dark World

370,NoodlePit,Now you're thinking with 6/10 portals,6,16 June 2020,"People complain about the humour in this movie (specifically Kat Dennings' character and her intern), but the humour is honestly the best part of the movie for me. Actually, I think this movie is just overall better than the first one. It feels like something actually happens, the twists work better, and the cinematography, sets and costumes all look better. The familial beats also hit their mark with me, especially with regards to Frigga.It's not without flaws though. I still can't quite take the fantasy elements all that seriously. They're better than in the first film, though. The villain really does not work. Jane getting infected by the Aether was a weird choice that seems to be there only to force her into the plot. Sif and the Warriors Three have even less presence in this movie. I am not a fan of crazy Dr. Selvig, especially with Iron Man 3 just prior to this taking PTSD after the Battle of New York seriously. I don't like the concept of Dr. Selvig's magic portal sticks, but they were used really creatively in the final fight scene.",Thor - The Dark World

For whatever reason MARVEL spares no expense to add levity across the film to make the severe theme(s) less painful (without spoilers). Stay until after the entire credits sequence, and when you get home pre-order the DVD. Tom as Loki is priceless, and the Eric Selvig character actor is almost Cleese-like. It's nothing like Ironman 3 nor Wolverine, it's all MARVEL keeping in phase with the upcoming stories.

This has exceptional action, good heart, good sad and a good bad. The humor was about 65% on, but I think the 35% that didn't hit was dry smirking humor, which is good for me. I do think the 2ndary Aasgard fighters or Thor's posse could have been used in the final battle against the other elves and that probably would have made it a 8.5 - 9.0 straight out.The disclosure is that Thor was my 2nd fav superhero growing up behind Spiderman so it would be hard for me not to like it, OVERALL IT WAS A VERY ENTERTAINING MOVIE.",Thor - The Dark World

If you expect Shakespearean depths... well if the fact that its a movie based on a comic book based on North mythology chewed by Uncle Sam didn't give you a hint its might not be your type of movie, i don't know what would have? For most of the part the film dose good with what its aims for... i think (i mean i never read any Thor comic book which i could compare it too)It has its moments, even though there are things that are pretty easy to figure out like the romance between Daisy and the intern. And sometimes the movie is stupid like when you put so much focus on Loki can not be trusted. Like 4 characters say ""he will betray you"" than 4 characters tell him ""i will kill you, if you betray Thor"" and Thor admits it he counting on Loki trying to betray him, and says like 2 times he dose not trust him. There plan depends on Lokis ability's of creating illusions. And its not like he did something terrible twice... oh wait he did. So after this much build up not even going ""hm... maybe i should really check if his really dead, or not just let him lay on the ground"" is the stupidest thing you can do. Its like Batman putting the Joker in a room with innocent people and going ""they will be fine"" If you just want some fun without too high expectations you probably will like it. I enjoyed it my self as a watchable once type of movie. But there are things which annoyed me i would like to address. 1) I know coming up with new stuff is hard, but could you at least drop the clichés? the first scene daisy and intern where together and daisy ignored her and did not listen to her it was clear they will just hook up at the end of the movie. things like this dose not make your movie better it drags it down. And watch out for stupid stuff. For example the death of the queen. I liked her strength and courage. What i did not like that the situation was stupid. How many guards where around Odin and Thor? I cant imagine a situation where for example the white house gets attacked and security goes ""lets protect the president and his son - What about the first lady? - meh she will be fine"" Shes the queen, when a unknown enemy attacks your fortress, you bloody protect the queen too, beside the king and there son. Anyways there also the thing i detailed before about Loki. And a small thing the creature which eat a few dark elf than till the end credits poof in to nothing. Im guessing its a predator, and somewhat Elephant size... so its probably eats a lot. And in a populated city there are plenty food = people. So seriously no body though ""might not be a bright idea to leave the giant predator roam around freely. 2) this is my personal opinion: Natalie Portman is a over rated actress, and she sucks in the sci-fi/action movies. She was terrible as Padme and keeps bringing the same bad acting as Jane Foster. I think shes more of a diva type, its always like Natalie Portman trying to play x character, and probably thinking about the Oscar party, or nail polish or plaza kitten stuff. 3) Stop inventing stupid alien languages. Or if you really need to do it make a nerd version and regular version. So the 25% nerd who actually gets a boner from a made up fake language can go to the nerd version. And 75% who dose not give a s*** or gets frustrated cause main characters keep speaking in a stupid gibberish language, and misses few words form the subtitle and loses the plot, there for the interest in the movie... its freaking Thor, if we are able to accept that the north mythology was ""true"" except they where aliens, we can handle aliens probably having there own language, but speaking English so the stupid non-sense blubbering dose not confuse us. 4)Im from Hungary. Americans pretty much the only nation who try to steal other nations myths and make a own version of it. And they are also the ones who will enjoy it the most. This is why characters like Thor and Wonder Woman will never be as popular in EU as they are in the US. This is why Thor is my least favorite Avenger. I think it improved a bit from the last movie, I mean we see more Asgard technology in this one, but beside this its still really unimaginative. Take a side that the idea to make North Myth in to a comic is stupid on its own. It still has the feeling that there civilization aren't involving. They still pretty much dress, battle, party like in the medieval with some polish. Just think about it how much human clothing, buildings, definition of fun, social interactions, views, religions... pretty much how everything changed several times in thousands of years. Not to mention this guys live thousand years people change often from decade to decade cause they learn and experience, what would a being who experience thousand years would be like? Imagine if for example Einstein would have lived for 5000 years what impact he would have than had on humanity? They don't have Geniuses in Asgard? I never able to shrug of the feeling that world(s)Thor trying to create just stopped in evolving and only exist so Americans can claim North Mythology as there own. And that's pretty much while Thor in best a watch able once popcorn cinema for me.",Thor - The Dark World
374,cubsckc,Nearly Perfect!,9,8 November 2013,"I heard a lot of good things before the movie came out, and it did not leave me with regret. Definitely a must watch film. A few things that I felt failed its justice I'm not sure could have been made better without making it a Lord of the Rings film. Firstly, I'm not sure the Dark Elves had enough screen time. They were awesome, and I think they chose some good actors for the part. I just feel they could have used their skills more. Secondly, they could have spent more time on the story about their past. It was good but they could have really highlighted this scenario to expand their fan base and create a cult of nerds. Again not sure if they could have been fixed, but as fiction fan who appreciates lore I have to express that. Lastly, not a big fan of the comedy, but I'm not a fun guy. Everyone else had a good time in the theaters. The acting was pretty good and I believe you felt the drama and emotion between Thor's family. To me that was the highlight of the movie. The custom, props and effects were great. That much said, I believe this movie makes you want to know more about the Marvel Universe and the scene after the credits leaves you handing.",Thor - The Dark World

376,Rage-Kage,Another great movie in 2013,10,19 November 2013,In my personal opinion 2013 has been full of great movies such as Iron Man Star Trek and Man of Steel just to name a few. Im really happy to be able to say I can now add yet another movie to the list. Thor the Dark World was every bit as awesome as I'd hoped it would be. The story of the MCU was furthered along as well as the story of the stand alone character Thor.I loved seeing Loki once again doing what he does I loved seeing Thor evolve more as a character and I also loved seeing Thor taken from a more sci fi approach.Its great seeing these big characters being worked into a story grounded in reality but since most of this movie didn't take place on Earth they were able to take a more futuristic like approach to realistic then they have before.Overall I don't really have a whole lot to say other then that Thor the Dark World is a great entry in the MCU I give Thor the Dark World a 10/10,Thor - The Dark World
377,tkbludis,Boring and mediocre,5,18 June 2019,"Thor The Dark World is a very boring MCU flick. The villain is boring and forgettable, the plot is meh, and the scenes on earth are very uninteresting. However the action sequences are fun and the special effects are good, and Anthony Hopkins is fantastic in this film. But overall Thor The Dark World is boring and mediocre.",Thor - The Dark World
378,tjsdomer2,A Low Key (Loki) Entry,6,13 August 2016,"Thor: The Dark World picks on Asgard at some point after the events of The Avengers. The Tesseract is safe. Thor has the good graces of Odin. Heimdall watches over a repaired Bifrost. Most importantly, Loki faces charges for his crimes on Earth. Lurking, however, is Malekith and his Dark Elves who wish to unleash the power of the Aether on the Nine Realms and return the universe to darkness.Overall, I don't really care about any of this stuff, save for one exception (more on that later). Thor: The Dark World struggles to improve on one of my biggest complaints of the first film; the nature of Odin's power and the Asgardians' immortality. The rules of the Eternal Realm seem too fast, loose, convenient, and underdeveloped for me to feel engaged, and once again, Odin comes across more as Mad King Ludwig than the Allfather.The new additions of Malekith and the Aether seem unconvincing as well, in that the former lacks screen presence and the latter doesn't really differentiate itself from the Tesseract. In the end, deus ex machina and weirdly times jokes rule the day and seems to answer any questions the viewer may have, or even distract one from them.Despite my complaints, Tom Hiddleston nearly puts on a one-man show as Loki, and delivers the best of his three performances in the MCU. Chris Hemsworth does a serviceable job as Thor as well, but Hiddleston certainly stands out and almost does enough to allow me to give this film a solid recommendation. 2.5 out of 4 stars.",Thor - The Dark World
379,jayz-55807,Disappointing,1,28 July 2020,"Chris Hemsworth is wonderful as Thor and Tom Hiddleston's Loki is the best. But Thor: The Dark World is a step down from 2011's Thor with average action, a flat romance and story that is slightly boring and feels insignificant within the Marvel canon.",Thor - The Dark World
380,wichtigesbuch,not worth watching,4,17 January 2021,This movie was like eating cereal and water. wouldn't watch it again.,Thor - The Dark World
381,hakrames,A let down to a improved sequel,6,23 March 2018,"Thor: The Dark World follows Thor, Son of Odin, after the events of The Avengers with the tension between his brother and him still tense and a new issue caused by family a long time ago affecting his current life with his love and the world he has grown to love too. Alan Taylor does a very good job directing. Improving on the first film with its overuse of dutch angles and keeping the filmmaking more simplistic and stylistic. The best part of the film is the action scenes are very well filmed and beautifully designed with special effects, great direction, and fantastic acting. This is though not Taylor's best film in his career and it sadly is the weakest Thor film in the now trilogy with a lot of issues from the script and some questionable acting choices as well that could come from Taylor or the casting director. Getting to the writing, it feels like each act in the film is written by a completely different person and has a few times that I felt like I was watching a different film completely with each act change. The script portrays the main antagonist as this one sided generic villain that has just one job and it is to destroy the universe, heard of that one before?, yeah me too. And especially with Iron Man 3 having a very rich villain, it falls short on the writing. Besides that the characters written are all good. But I do feel like they were trying to cram in as much as they can into this film which was completely unnecessary for this aftermath film. Then the tone change, with it going from extremely dark and serious scenes to awkward comedy doesn't transfer well at all in this film and honestly doesn't feel like a Marvel film when rewatching it. The acting is overall amazing. Hemsworth drastically improved in this stand alone film compared to the first in his acting. Hiddleston is once again amazing as the god of tricks and his manipulation and use of great plan developing to get what he needs. Even minor characters like Thor's warriors and his mom and dad all are so much stronger than the first film and have a lot more useful parts and more defining roles than the first film which is nice. But the main villain once again comes off bad compared to the rest of the film. It could've been from the prosthetics but his acting comes off so bland and feels like his voice is one of those computer text-to-speech things. But one character compared to an ensemble of amazing actors can be forgotten. With a huge issue of storytelling and a single character that could've been better written and acted. It falls short on its potential as the sequel. Thor: The Dark World gets a 6/10",Thor - The Dark World
382,theflixerdotcom,Better than the first Thor..,7,11 November 2013,"I thought that Thor was a decent movie, but possibly the weakest of the Avenger stand alone movies. I didn't think it was on par with The Hulk Remake, Iron Man, and even Captain America. I felt the Thor movie was a little weaker (Captain America is a close, but not too close, second place).That said, Thor: The Dark World gives Thor the type of movie that the first one should have been. The scale is larger, the effects are better, and I think the story was stronger. I enjoyed the humerus aspects of the film which were ramped up due the success of the Avengers. This formula works.Hemsworth does a good job with Thor. You can tell he's really embraced this role as it is his defining role to date. He obviously looks the part, and he does a good job giving Thor a personality. He's a little rigid, but I think that's the character he's playing. The intensity is there, but so is the comic relief when it needs to be.Tom Hiddleston really steals the show with Loki. His charisma shines through in his portrayal and you can really tell when a truly talented stage/film actor such as Hiddleston finds a role and a character that he truly loves. His portrayal is effortless and full of emotion, which in my opinion, makes Loki by far the most intriguing villain in the entire Marvel Universe.I could do without Natalie Portman's character. I understand it's necessary in order to humanize the film and link Thor to Earth, but I find it a little pointless that she has to be included as a piece of the puzzle surrounding the Dark Elf mytho. Having Asgaard and the Dark Elves battle on their own would have been just as effective and less annoying.The three Agaardians are utilized much less in this movie and were almost rendered to bit-parts. I thought this was too bad as I'm certain they have larger roles to fill in the comic book universe and would have been a better fit into the movies as compared to the group of annoying human characters.Odin (Anothony Hopkins) was a mystery to me. In the first movie he is seen as a confident, wise, powerful leader whom must be shown respect and yet in this movie he appears to be a cranky old man. I wasn't thrilled with the treatment Odin received.In the end this is a solid movie and I think much better than the original. There are some strange directions taken with the story, but in the end some fantastic effects, solid acting, funny jokes, and Loki redeem many of the flaws Rating: 7.5/10",Thor - The Dark World
383,WheelzFourReelz,Thor: The Dark World is an enjoyable superhero movie. If only it were more...,7,2 March 2014,"Thor: The Dark World is a movie I have been waiting for a long time. I really enjoyed the first (no matter how average people thought it) and the trailer for the sequel looked awesome. And I hoped it was awesome. Was it awesome? Almost. This movie takes place a few years after The Avengers. The nine realms are at peace until all of a sudden, evil is released. Best synopsis ever. As plots go, it's pretty good. It stays true to the superhero formula and has a couple of plot twists. One is a complete surprise, one is completely predictable. However, there are a lot of plot holes in this movie. Often in the movie, I was scratching my head thinking, ""Wait, how would that work?"" That kind of detracts from the movie a little. Now, I'm going to be straight with you. For the first forty minutes or so, I was thinking, ""Okay, this movie is having a hard time going anywhere."" Yeah, it starts out rough. The beginning of the movie starts out rather dull. It had a hard time pulling me in and keeping me invested. But, when things started going down and punches were thrown, that's when things got interesting. It turned out to be a fun movie, but I wish it had the same charm from the beginning. Speaking of charm, this movie is very funny. It's the funniest Marvel movie since The Avengers (which isn't saying much because the only other Marvel movie that came out after The Avengers is Iron Man 3, but it's still the funniest). There were chuckle moments and even moments that had me laughing out loud. However, there were some jokes that felt stale. Most of them came from Kat Denning's character. I think she's very cute, but she didn't really have that much of a point in this movie. The action is what you'd except in a superhero movie; action packed awesomeness. And that's what this movie has. It was just cool seeing Thor wipe out a bunch of people with his hammer. IT'S SO SATISFYING! Overall, this movie is good. It isn't quite as good as the original Thor, but I still enjoyed it. It's definitely a worthy successor to The Avengers and it's definitely worth checking out. And it has not only an awesome Stan Lee cameo, but also an awesome cameo of a certain Avenger. No spoilers, just saying.",Thor - The Dark World

386,rdnyscott,beautiful movie,10,17 December 2017,"Though the closed captioned Star Trek like elves detracted from the quality, the rest of this movie was wonderful. The rejection of Loki by his family causes the audience to truly sympathize. On top of this, he faces threats by Thor and his friends, as Thor just assumes Loki wants revenge for the death of their mother merely because Thor does. The part where we see the brotherly interaction as they argue over how to direct the spaceship was adorably accurate and hilarious. I think this movie is being rated so poorly due to the closed captioned elf scenes, which were boring, but I loved everything else, especially the end where Loki winds up on the throne because he is disguised as Odin. The scenes without language captions were very emotionally poignant and compelling.",Thor - The Dark World
387,thealphakeno,It was a fantastic movie yet boring,7,19 November 2013,"It wasn't a very good start but the ending was superb. Thor 2: The Dark World was a fantastic movie yet boring. It was like Iron Man 2 which is full of dead scenes and conversation. The movie consists of 50% talking and 50% amazing fighting scenes. lots of funny parts though.I'm not a Thor fan. I'm a Loki fan that's why I'm seeing the movie. The movie was very deep which is at some point, non fans couldn't understand at all like fans need to explain the scenes for them to understand. The CGI effects were too bright and look unrealistic at all. They should've worked on it.The story focuses on the battle between Malekith, who wants to destroy the universe and the Asgardians after taking the Aether from Jane Forster's body. Loki helped Thor and used the opportunity on becoming a king. The mid credits scene explains the Aether as part of the six gems on the Infinity Gauntlet. The Collector kept it which leads to the storyline of ""The Guardian of The Galaxy"" in the future where we might see Thanos using it to conquer the universe.I rated it 80%. Not bad for a Marvel Movie.",Thor - The Dark World
388,elliomartinez,Just bad,3,9 February 2021,"The worst MCU movie I've watched so far. It was boring and uninteresting. It added nothing to the franchise except for the Aether (reality stone), and the way it was presented was also confusing. The use of color to set the tone of ""dark world"" was clever, but at times it was too dark.Natalie Portman's character is extremely boring!!!",Thor - The Dark World
389,yaxleycratler,I liked it!!!,8,8 August 2018,"Despite the crappy reviews it has gotten I thought this movie was really good. The characters were more thought out and not as bland as in the first one, Hiddleston once again gives and memorable performance and I loved how they delved into his character more than any one else's. Thor was there to be awesome and Jane was also there but she wasn't as helpful as before probably because of the Aether. Malekith was a cool villain but very underdeveloped. They could've added a couple more minutes to explain his character more. Thor was also funny in this film which was nice because Thor is usually so serious. The beginning and ends of the movie were fantastic. Overall the kind of forgot the Thor and Kane live affair and opted for a good movie.",Thor - The Dark World
390,warrenf_peace,"Excellent Sequel needing Thor 3 and ""Thor Four"" *SPOILERS*",8,8 November 2013,"I loved the first film, and with good reason - Kenneth Branaugh directing is always top shelf, and the cast was really strong. I looked forward to the sequel, knowing well it would be hard to match the freshness, art and grandeur of the first film. And the movie-going experience indeed started strange: I showed up right at the start time (11:00 AM matinée'), which by AMC Lowes standard means that I would have 4 - 6 previews to sit through, plus a few ads. Curiously, as I sat down (at 11:03, expecting to see ads..) I came midway into the ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" preview. I asked my neighbor if there had been other previews, and he said, ""This is the first preview,"" and I thought 'Goodie! I can see what other Sci Fi or Superhero films are coming soon.' But to my surprise, the movie started next! Totally out of character for AMC. The intro was a laconic (low-key) teaser, which did set the tone for the film (it was a little flat). While I liked the movie (I love the characters - Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard and Tom Hiddleston - not to mention Sir Anthony Hopkins - are all excellent thespians), I blame the director Alan Taylor for not getting as much emotional reach from them and the story as I would have liked, (but then, I am a genius, and super- critical :<)There were fantastic, well-conceived story ideas in this film, great action, nice unexpected surprises, some cute humor (Dr. Eric Selvig is great as usual - he better be in Thor 3 and ""THOR 4/Thorfour?""!!), and Darcy even has some great humorous scenes, too. Plus, I could look at Natalie Portman all day. My chief complaint was the emotional flatness after a certain queen's fate, which could have brought down the house, but the story didn't have time to develop certain relationships, and that is my other complaint; it felt slow in parts, hurried in others. But still, it's one I want in my library, because Marvel has a great franchise here. The fact that Thor was one of my favorite superhero comics as a kid has nothing to do with it, although they have cast the characters as perfect as you can get. I wish I could get hired for the next installment, because they have teed up the trilogy nicely, with many possibilities, and I Hope the actors will find a way to sign contracts for 2 more films, before any other actors are changed (*SPOILER* Switching actors for the part of Fandral wasn't a show-stopper, but I would have liked for them to have kept Josh Dallas from the first Thor).So I give the film an 8/10, although I nearly gave it a 7 (7.5 is probably where it belongs). It's a GOOD movie, not GREAT, and not the first Thor, but an entertaining, exciting, visually compelling, well-acted sequel that I Hope makes enough box office to guarantee the next 2 movies (with Hemsworth, Portman, Hiddleston, Skarsgard at a minimum reprising their roles, and hopefully the others, too). They could do a nice love triangle intrigue between Jamie Alexander - who looks great in this, BTW, and kicks ass convincingly! - and Portman. If you are a fan, you HAVE to see Thor 2, and if you are new to it, by all means see Thor 1 and Avengers first, if you can, as it will be much easier to follow - at a minimum, see Thor 1. The key to the success of this franchise will hinge on the next film, which I can envision as being the best of the series IF they get the story right. This should lead to an Avengers 3, and then back to Thor 4, by which time Hemsworth might be ready to give 'Meow meow' (as Darcy calls Mjolnir) to the next red-caped, crusading Asgardian.",Thor - The Dark World
391,soloriamagic08,Strongly lacks the emotional core of the first movie,6,11 November 2013,"A dark elf named Malekith and his right hand Argrim/Kurse fought an ancient war against Odin's father for the possession of a powerful macguffin called the Aether. If possessed by the elves it has the power to put the entire universe back into darkness. However, this can only occur during the convergence. This is when all planets in the nine realms are perfectly aligned and thus easier for Malekith to use the aether to darkify all worlds at once. He loses and is forced to flee and put himself and his surviving people into stasis until the aether is accidentally found once again by a certain brown-haired scientist. Cue Thor and the problems this brings to his world and family.Mal and Argrim/Kurse- Neither character has any real depth. The director said that unfortunately most of it was left on the cutting room floor. However, even though kurse does most of the brute strength work in the movie, and Mal really doesn't get to do anything groundbreaking until the final battle, both are deliciously intimidating and menacing. Basically they are everything Loki failed to be in two movies. Good villains. They lack strong characterization but they both got the job done. Their actors worked with what they had and they did it beautifully. Also of special mention is the dark elf language. It was made especially for this movie and sounds deliciously demonic.When the aether is awoken again Thor is forced to team up with his deeply untrustworthy adopted brother Loki, and his shallow as a kiddle pool love interest Jane Foster. He is more mature here, but also still very likable. Movie hit its stride when Thor and Loki are together. Great chemistry. Their screen-time together is unfortunately all to brief. Gotta get back to what's important Jane's posse and their'funny' earth scenes.Jane- she serves three unfortunate purposes and they are the plot device to get Thor to earth, his depthless love interest, and a damsel in the distress. Seriously she literally spends the second half of the film knocked out, has no speaking lines with Loki after the infamous slap, and barely any lines of note with Thor either for that matter. She does get to be of use in the final battle, but it's a little too late. Foster (and friends) needs to be written out of the story someday soon.Loki-I liked the character yet again and he is the sole reason I went to the theater to see this. I saw Thor and the Avengers on Netflix. He has such a strong presence that the screen feels empty when he isn't on it. His overall characterization and agency felt more at home here. Like this is the real continuation of Loki from Thor 1 instead of that pathetic comedic mess he was written as in the Avengers. This movie just proved to me yet again that Loki is treated better as a character in the Thor movies.Acting overall was good.I loved the ending credit artwork.No love triangle crap. Asgard was beautiful. It looked more lived in here. Music was decent, but scenes go by so quickly that you really can't appreciate it. You will actually have to youtube if you actually want to listen to it.Fanservice pandering is very evident here to the detriment of overall characterization. Will become very apparent what I mean by this after the movie is watched.Comedy- overall execution is the problem. Sad things happen in this movie and yet I didn't care. Couldn't care. A lot of the comedic points were strongly misplaced.This leads me to my biggest problem there was a severe lack of emotional impact. The somber scenes just flew past while the earth and funny got to keep on strutting. Transitions from melancholy to earth/funny were off big time. We aren't given time to linger and soak in what just happened and the characters aren't either. More time should have been spent on the emotional scenes and less on the latter.Earth- more tolerable then the first one, but overall still the most boring part of the Thor movies. If they can't (or won't) get rid of earth, at least in his movies, then please tone it down. Just like the first film the most exciting and character driven scenes happened on Asgard and the other worlds. Leave earth for the avenger team-ups. It's not the runtime it's what you do with it that matters. We stayed on earth with its meh characters and comedic moments to long, and the emotional parts suffered greatly for it.The overall dialogue was off. It was clunky in parts and cheesy. I definitely preferred the first movie.Two credit scenes - The mid is foreshadowing a movie to come and it's an atrocious looking scene. It looked like it came from the worst of the sci-fi channel. Even the director has gone on record despising it. It was filmed by someone else. If this is a hint to what this future movie will look, and play, like then I sense marvels first bomb. End credit was meh to.Disney's cheesy stamp is all over this. You can tell Marvel /Disney had their hands too far in the cookie jar in this one. To the point the director is asking fans to petition for a director's cut so we can get the serious, emotional movie he wanted instead of this big budget action comedy. I will never understand how they seem to know that the family drama is where the juicy meat is, and yet they keep giving us large doses of earth characters and their 'funny' moments. It's like since the Avengers has made this a shared universe Thor can't be the high fantasy drama it could and should be. Overall this movie did the visuals and action better than the first, but it missed the boat on the most important thing to me. A soul.",Thor - The Dark World
392,TiagoRicardo,Better than expected,7,3 November 2013,"Let me just start this by saying that I was not expecting great things from this movie, but Marvel has done it right again and i believe that anyone who enjoyed the first movie will not be disappointed with this one. The special effects were really cool and the Asgard scenes were amazing in IMAX 3D. The return of Thor and Loki was by far better than I expected. Loki was really better than in ""The Avengers"", it was more funny and more enjoyable to watch. The only negative point in this movie is the villain (Malekith) which is like an accessory to the story. Marvel Cinematic Universe is getting better and I cannot wait for ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". Definitely a surprise, ""Thor: The Dark World"" is one of those rare cases where the sequel beats its predecessor.",Thor - The Dark World

395,adam-scrivner,Better than I expected,5,20 November 2013,"Having seen the first Thor film I knew not to expect too much - lots of action, plenty of nonsense, Anthony Hopkins looking a little worn, moderately thin plot. All of these were delivered. Surprisingly the acting was not too bad at all in places, although the Darcy Lewis character is one of the most irritating that I have had the misfortune to experience on screen.There was some confusion early on as there were references made to events that weren't in the first film, so I must have missed another Thor film at some point, but I can only find one other on IMDb. This also detracted from my enjoyment.In a nutshell, after a promising start, the film nose-dived considerably, but then managed to claw its way back up from being ""awful"" to simply being ""mediocre"". As brainless sequels go this was a reasonable effort, but I won't bother watching it when it is eventually on the telly.",Thor - The Dark World
396,veensepeper,Worthy follow-up to both Thor and the Avengers,8,5 December 2013,"I must admit, after seeing a mere mediocre Iron Man 3, which was saved by the actors as opposed to delivering an exciting story... I worried for the Marvel Phase 2 as a whole. Thor: The Dark World proved me wrong.Yes, it has its weaknesses. There is a scene where Thor and Loki are walking down the hall; Loki transforms them into a number of different characters. It serves no other purpose then amusing the children - adults will find the scene embarrassingly annoying. When a major character dies, leaving an impact on Thor, Odin and Loki, it felt rushed. And there were too many clues towards the somewhat forced twist at the end, which made the reveal obsolete.Also, it was a little too much of plot convenience that it was Jane who discovered the evil force Macguffin. And Selvig being a little craycray as an aftereffect from the Tessaract makes you wonder how Hawkeye fares these days.Other than that: it was all a great roller coaster ride. Especially the final fight, which was both personal and still had multiple worlds at stake. It also featured really fast paced interdimensional traveling that felt like a more crazy episode of Phineas and Ferb - but due to a good set-up never got you to loose the suspension of disbelief.So, without any (mentionable) spoilers... this is Thor: the Dark World for you. Epic and Awesome...",Thor - The Dark World
397,camachbr0,"Came for Thor, Got a little More",7,20 April 2014,"MINOR Spoilers; Nothing on what happened, just some scenes I wasn't a reader of the comic books. I didn't get to adore Thor till I saw the film. So being a ""newbie"" (as I bet most comic book geeks would label me) I felt that Thor: The Dark World was the first of the films that was a little too concerned with shifting the universe smoothly from its second phase to its third. Don't get me wrong Thor 2 was a fun film to watch, and a good one, but as much as it feels that it picked right up after Thor 1 (or the Avengers, I think that's the correct chronology) there were some character inconsistencies and a patchy ending that felt as though it was putting a band-aid on a gashing cut. The biggest dynamic is the shift of chemistry from Thor's relationship with Jane Foster to Thor's relationship with Loki, that sonovagun Loki. When they team up in the film its hands down the most enjoyable part. Their brotherly banter, with Loki as the nagging little brother and Thor as the ""shut up bro"" older brother feels real. The looming question, Is Loki good now, or is he still bad, builds more suspense than the final showdown between Thor and the bad guy. Tom Hiddleston kills the role. As long as Loki remains a big of a part to the universe, we'll be seeing him in future ""Top 10 Villains of all Times"" lists. Apparently the ritual sacrifice to holy brotherhood was the love story of Jane Foster played by cutie pie, Natalie Portman. Bottom line is that a love scene would have kept the romance interesting (and the film PG-13). Thor and Jane Foster's relationship was a big reason why the first film was so good. The notion that Thor wasn't able to see her ever again was the biggest question I wanted to see answered in The Dark World. Despite the bi-frost being totally destroyed in Thor 1, Thor is sailing from realm to realm (apparently for two years) kicking ass and taking names before he casually plops on Earth to see Jane. Common girlfriend line, ""Where were you my superhero hunk? You never called"" is answered with, "" Babe, I was too busy making sure the realms were free of ugly creatures."" I wasn't a fan of how they ""band-aided"" that situation, and I wasn't a fan of the romance-less between the two. I think they kiss twice, and one of those times is in a post-credit scene. Our Earthlings, Darcy, Eric Selvig, and a new intern, are really, really un-interesting: the worst part is they play a part in the resolution. Selvig's dive from the responsible moral voice in the first film to ""running around naked in public"" crazy scientist is one of the easier character inconsistencies to spot. Darcy's a bunch of one-liners. Chris O' Dowd (cop from Bridesmaid) plays an earthling interested in Jane Foster, but he's really there to set up a jealousy quip by Thor. Ironically these earthlings feel more like aliens than the Asgards. The gatekeeper is still awesome. Thor's fighting sequences are still awesome. Odin is still awesome, although a bit meaner and questionable in his choices (character inconsistency #2). We all agree Loki is awesome. The humorous, relaxed feeling that we get from all the Marvel Universe films (except Hulk) is awesome. A touch of Star Wars is awesome. Essentially The Dark World delivers on the promise that it's going to be just as entertaining as the original. However it's too concerned with progression of the cinematic universe that it forgets Thor is what we picked to watch. You'll realize this in the end if you truly think about how the ""twists"" are actually cliffhangers to set up what's next. The patching to go along with a forgettable villain that's almost an illusion to distract us makes this a downgrade from the original, but it's another day another adventure in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and that's always worth watching. 7/10",Thor - The Dark World

400,newtonpost,"Well, that was a surprise",10,30 October 2013,"Just got back from seeing this and thought I'd put in my thoughts.This is by far the most intricate and thoughtful of the Marvel films to date, with a great story and some superb performances, particularly Hiddleston's as Loki. The characters from previous Asgard related outings are there, but thanks to some good writing, are more 3 dimensional and therefore, interesting. This is one of the few films that would have benefited from an extra 15 minutes or so to explore further the motivations of the key protagonists. There is plenty of large scale action, as well as some laugh out loud humorous moments that help to keep this kicking along.I am both surprised and delighted that this is not only the best superhero movie to date, (even eclipsing Spider-Man 2), but currently the best movie I've seen this year.Don't miss this!",Thor - The Dark World

But the story progressed in a very good way towards the end. The mega-franchise sequels is getting interesting with each of the movies. Hope for more superb sequels for this one as this as a cliff-hanger on the mid-credit bonus scene at the end which will keep the audience intrigued to watch the next sequel very eagerly.The first Thor movie was not that good according to me as it looked like, along with Captain America, was done in preparation for the The Avengers Assemble movie. But this movie story moves independently continuing from that movie with only references to it.On the whole a great movie to watch to the fans of Mega-Marvel franchise.

Yes I know this is entertainment, and this movie was moderately entertaining, but once again the makers have tried to please everyone by adding a bit of everything; action, special effects, romance and humour, just far too much of the latter for my taste in a genre that does not require hilarity to succeed.Although it has a lower IMDb score I much preferred the 2011 Thor, a stronger storyline, darker and no laughing matter!",Thor - The Dark World
403,imdb-783-507847,Actually really rather good...,8,2 November 2013,"The Review: For me the original Thor film was my second , least favourite Marvel adaptation after Captain America (sorry Capt.). It wasn't bad but it always felt like it was missing something special. Now, two years later and bolstered by an appearance alongside his Avengers buddies, the Blonde, buff god returns in what is a far more well rounded and successful movie.The Story: Faced with an enemy that even Odin and Asgard cannot withstand, Thor must embark on his most perilous and personal journey yet, one that will reunite him with Jane Foster and force him to sacrifice everything to save us all.Firstly let's get this out the way. Thor 2 is actually really good. Excellent in fact. Of all the Avengers films, it's probably the most 'together ' . It has a simple story, which moves at pace, with action and drama but keeping it tight enough to come in at under 2 hours. It even manages to get around (at least MOSTLY get around) the standard CGI monster fighting CGI good guy trope that has hobbled the end of every Avengers film since Iron Man.A large reason why the film works so well is the sublime decision to once again sit an unlikely candidate in the director's chair. Be it Jon Favreau for Iron Man or James Gunn for the upcoming Guardians Of The Galaxy, Marvel have a knack of picking the right man for the job. This time out respected TV and Game Of Thrones director Alan Taylor brings a more even vision to the film, much more suited to the material than Kenneth Branagh, and obviously revels in having a larger that his usual budget to play with. The action is clean and well shot, and best of all you can see every punch, every explosion and every insane flying spaceship moment.Oh and talking of flying Spaceship moments director Taylor is obviously a fan of 80's cheese fest Flash Gordon, being that he borrows a considerable part of the films finale for the attack on Asgard. Not that I'm complaining as the mix of sci-fi, Norse legend, super hero and action make for a pleasant change form the usual Earth bound Marvel world.Hemsworth once again proves he is a man of considerable talent, delivering action alongside comedy and the occasional pathos. Naturally Natalie Portman has little to do (as is the female role generally in a Marvel film) but she remains a welcome addition, as does the returning Idris Elba, Tom Hiddleston (once again a stand out as Loki) and Anthony Hopkins (as his most gravelly). Rene Russo even gets to kick arse, which is nice. As for former Dr Who and professional grump Christopher Eccleston he does good with his limited bad guy role, but in reality with the added make up and FX it could have been anyone as Dark Elf leader Malekif.In truth the film has little against it, other than maybe an element of familiarity, and ends up being one of the best blockbusters of the year. Maybe not as good overall as Iron Man 3, but certainly more fun. For the most part.So overall a good script, great characters and some snappy dialogue alongside standout action sequences and a fast pace mean that deservedly Thor The Dark World will be another hit for Marvel. Truly a studio that cant seem to get it wrong.Reviewed By: Phil HobdenJoin the debate on our Facebook Group (www.facebook.com/groups/Filmsploitation) or on our website (www.thefilmpodcast.co.uk)",Thor - The Dark World
404,brickmoviereviews,Thor: The Dark Wolrd - Marvel's Phase Two Indeed Gets Darker,7,8 November 2013,"Imagine what it was like before the solar system existed. Now, imagine what it was like before the universe existed. Before the universe, what was there? According to Norse mythology, before the universe, there was darkness. In Thor: The Dark World, directed by Alan Taylor, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is forced to fight the darkness that once consumed everything.Two years after Thor's first visit to Earth, and just over a year after The Battle of New York, scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) dreams that one day Thor will fulfill his promise to her and come back. While on a date, Jane's assistant Darcy (Kat Dennings) pulls her away from her date and to a deserted building which housed some sort of portal. After being sucked in by a portal, Jane stumbles upon the aether, a powerful, other worldly element desired by leader of the dark elves, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), to bring the darkness back to the universe forever. The aether, with a mind of it's own (in a way), attached itself to Jane, now living inside her. When Jane surfaces back in London, she is greeted by Thor, who takes her back to Asgard after realizing something is terribly wrong.Once the aether is awakened, Malekith is also. He learns that the aether is on Asgard, so he strikes. After a bloody battle, Thor is forced to go to the one man in all the nine realms who he trusts the least, his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston). With Loki free for now, he, Thor, and Jane set out to destroy Malekith and save the nine realms from eternal darkness.Being the second installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Phase Two, Thor: The Dark World does a nice job of getting the story across. The Dark World was miles better than Thor back in 2011, and while it certainly is not the best movie of Phase Two, and only tops a couple movies in Phase One, TDW holds it's ground. Much of the movie was CGI effects, which were spectacular. Also, TDW seemed to go along with the overall plan of Phase Two to go darker, which TDW did both literally and story wise. While some may say that Malekith is a perfectly suitable villain, an argument can be made that he was subpar, and could have been made much more evil. Sprinkled throughout the movie were scenes that could have, and probably should have, been removed. Also, some plot point may be confusing, so be sure to pay close attention.All in all, Thor: The Dark World is a solid movie. Chris Hemsworth gives the best performance he has given as the character. Tom Hiddleston once again shines as Loki, and Natalie Portman does a solid job as Jane Foster. Unfortunately, Stellan Skarsgård's Dr. Erik Selvig is ridiculously underused and treated as a joke, which is a shame especially considering the roles he play in Thor and The Avengers. With all this being said, Thor: The Dark World is still a definite must see.Rating: 7 of 10BrickMovieReviews.wordpress.com @BrickFilmReview",Thor - The Dark World
405,r_massey,We're up all night to get Loki,4,22 September 2014,"The first half of the film was very boring and did NOTHING to engage the audience. The film only really picked up just before Loki was broken out of his cell by Thor. Characters (apart from Loki) were bland and extremely boring, Malekith was terrible, the Aether just seemed like another Tesseract, his army were a little too similar to the Chitari for my liking and may as well have just been Storm Troopers and the whole ""turning the entire universe into darkness"" plot line seemed too cliché. Special effects were special. What was with the weird colour scheme used and the blurry backgrounds? It looked like something out of 300. Asgard still looked nice. I enjoyed seeing Loki and Thor team-up but Thor's action sequences on his own weren't that good. The final battle was a little too reminiscent of the IM3 final battle for my liking; Thor jumping into different worlds/Tony jumping into different Iron Man suits. So, this film is only really good enough because of Loki. If it wasn't for the character and his excellent portrayal by Tom Hiddleston, this film would most likely get a 3/10. If you want to know what happens in the film because you want to catch up with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, just read the plot online and maybe watch a montage of the best Loki moments in the film.",Thor - The Dark World
406,sankhan99,Don't watch 3D Version,5,4 December 2013,"First part was much better than this one. Title in review has quite weak plot and above all it lacks emotional intensity and thrill which first part had. Because of shallow plot, this movie will fail to take you along. In these kind of movies Villains are very powerful and invincible. But heroes look for out of the box solutions to get them down but in this movie Villain character is very weak and is without any convention. Villain doesn't look intelligent and dangerous to me. He was just a villain to fill space. Good news is there are 2-3 laughs as well though I didn't laugh as I found them not very laughable.Direction was OK. Acting was good as normally is in these kind of Films. Portman was bit better. This movie has high production value. Lot of effort and money used in creating stunning visual effects.So my suggestion to readers is that ""Don't watch it in 3D"" specially if you have watched Gravity in 3D recently. You will feel very bad like me. And will curse 3D technology which I think is mind blowing if used properly.Its OK for one time watch but nothing memorable.",Thor - The Dark World

I am already excited for the movie to hit the theater, now I am extremely thrilled once watching it. I think it was more into the movie itself than what to do with the prequel of it, or even The Avengers Movie. I mean, it certainly can be enjoyable enough even if you didn't watch any of the other two movies. I am a big fan of Loki, and that would certainly escalated even much better after seeing his stunning tricks in this movie. Believe me, you would be too. I think it was a solid story plus actions in it. More than just entertained by the hilarious scenes that keep on flashing upon the screen, the Max of 2 Broke Girls (Kat Dennings) sprinkled more dusty jokes that would make you laugh. I am a big fan of Marvel Avengers Game on Facebook too, which help me love this movie so much more with all those characters such Sif, and not to mention its newly Special Ops 14. And if you're a fan of Chuck, the Zachary Levi played quite a role in this movie as well. I can't explain how much I love this movie, unless you watch it yourself.

409,mynameisibrahim,Fun movie going experience,7,1 November 2013,"Thor, the Mighty Avenger, returns in his third outing in as many years. His latest installment derives plot strands from Thor and also deals with the residual effect of Avengers Assemble.With Loki imprisoned in the dungeons of Asgard, Thor strives along with his loyal comrades Lady Sif and the Warriors Three to maintain equilibrium across the nine realms. However, unbeknownst to Asgard, an old nemesis resurfaces in the form of the dark elves. Circumstances dictate Thor to forge an unlikely alliance with the captive Loki, in order to prevent an impending cataclysm.Directing duties change hands from Kenneth Branagh to Alan Taylor. A television veteran, Taylor has experience with shows such as Lost, The Sopranos and recently, Game of Thrones. It is that background which serves him well in this instance.He excels in making personalities with demi-god status more relatable, both in triumph and loss. All things affiliated with Asgard exhibits more authenticity. Furthermore, the characters are grounded in reality and the sequel delves deeper into the intricate relationships between characters than its predecessor.Chris Hemsworth is an admirable physical and emotional embodiment of the Norse deity. Tom Hiddleston is able to delineate grey shades in another accomplished performance as the nefarious Loki. While the latter may garner plaudits for his portrayal, Hemsworth shines as the eponymous warrior as well.While Thor was ostracized to earth in the first movie, the roles are now reversed and Jane Foster, played by Natalie Portman, is taken to Asgard. Portman is afforded a more substantial role and is pivotal to proceedings. All in all, she does well as Thor's star struck love interest.Doctor Who alum Christopher Eccleston portrays the implacable Malekith, a dark elf hell bent on seeking retaliation. While he delivers a menacing threat, assuring higher stakes for Thor, ultimately Malekith is tantamount to a generic and one-dimensional antagonist.The highlight of The Dark World is undoubtedly its humor. The blue print is akin to Iron Man 3 and the director is able to balance the comic relief with dramatic sequences. Secondly, the Thor and Loki dynamic is a thrill for viewers. Their collective charisma ensures some of the movie's better sequences.Moreover, the action and visual effects, in keeping with other Marvel movies, are exquisite. Battles are well executed and expansive, particularly the swashbuckling finale. Last but not least, the story arcs for both Thor and Loki culminate in an emotionally satisfying manner.The film is not without its loopholes though. At a running time of only 112 minutes, events unfold at breakneck speed, which may feel like several scenes have been edited. Ultimately, the sequel is bigger than its precursor in terms of scale and provides an engaging movie going experience.",Thor - The Dark World

This one, on the other hand, is not only a cliché soap opera movie, but confused as what it wants to be. Half the beginning forces rom-com background music on us & the other half is full of ironic quips & other shenanigans that belong in a Jim Carrey film. The story, villain, and connectivity to The Avengers is laughable and the cliché humanoid 60's Star Trek aliens take you out of the movie. This should have been a home run but it's quite disappointing if looking at it objectively and not as a drooling Avengers fanboy.

413,reigntall,One of the better entries in the Marvel series,7,31 October 2013,"Thor: The Dark World is the next entry in the high quality series of Marvel movies over the 7 years or so and it is one of the best. Its funny, its got action. And did I mention its funny? Honestly, I think this movie had more sarcastic comments, wise cracks per minute than it did hammer punches to the face.Story is fairly generic. Super evil guy thought long dead wants super evil thing. Thor and crew doesn't want him to get it. It's straighforward enough. However, for a movie titled Thor, it sure does spend a large amount of screen time with other people, Natalie Portman, the other scientists when Natalie Portman is in Viking Land, Loki, the bad guy, Loki again. Actually, I don't really mind the Loki part. I hate him as a character, but he is fascinating. He truly is the god of mischief, you never know what side he is on, though usually its his own side. I don't understand how anybody trusts him ever.Every character always has something funny to say. Every side character is comic relief, and Thor is pretty funny himself too. With so much casual comedy all the time, the incredibly sad and dramatic moments create a jarring tonal shift. Then after a short while its back to jokejokejoke. For most of the movie, the action isn't that mind blowing or fascinating. But the movie makes up for it with the final fight, full of chaos-inducing wobbly gravity and warping all over the place.tl;dr a fun, entertaining super hero movie, with jarring tonal shifts, but one of the most fun final action sequences.",Thor - The Dark World
414,maleficarus,Sigh...Zzzz...,6,22 December 2013,I was never a really big fan of Thor to begin with and this movie just proves it to me again. This movie was so slow and boring. The first hour I almost fell asleep a few times. The special effects were really well done but other then that I really do not think this was a great movie. I gave this movie a generous 6 out of a possible 10. Normally these types of movies at least earn a 7 from me but this one at best was a 6 only.You can tell that this sequel was made for the sack of making some more money off the very boring Thor. I for one will not waste my money on a third that is for sure. They really need to stop wasting everyone's time with Thor. He is boring and other then his looks has very little going for him. Good day!,Thor - The Dark World
415,irrelevantlife,A wasted opportunity,6,9 March 2014,"Thor's character, motivation and relationship to his brother Loki and with a mortal young woman has been the focus of the first Thor movie and extended into the Avengers. Yet not much was ever revealed. I went into this movie, thinking that we would learn much more about Thor, his home world, his relationship with the young woman he loves, and the consequences Loki's actions have had for Thor's family. Only a very small portion of that is ever fulfilled in this movie.Sadly, we don't see much character development, and not much consequence is given to the conflict that involves forgettable villains and schemes. The main characters are not given any time to reflect or show emotional attachment, even when one seemingly important character is killed. Furthermore the action scenes tend to be overdone, and lose interest as they go through the motions. The movie is filled with humor, and in my opinion it goes too far. There is no investment to be made for the characters. I can understand when a movie does not want to take itself too serious, but this was bordering on comedy, where I thought that lines that were delivered didn't fit the intended mood of the scenes in any way. The performances were very bland, and Loki's character seemed to be the only one believing he was in a science-fiction/fantasy world, whereas the rest of the cast were pretty much dialing it in.So a missed opportunity, not even a big budget can save it from feeling perfunctory, with too many shallow underdeveloped characters and a boring conflict that doesn't seem to carry any real depth for us to care about.",Thor - The Dark World

Read on to find out more!!!",8,2 November 2013,"Thor returns in yet another triumphant adventure. When the original aired in 2011 it was perhaps the Marvel property that people were most skeptical about. The God of Thunder, wearing a red cape, Norse mythology and all, it sounded really silly. It was perhaps this low level of expectation, which I also had for Iron Man, which helped to make it such a success. It was fun and loud with a good heart at its core, not to mention introducing Chris Hemsworth and the outstanding Tom Hiddleston. Their chemistry helped to seal the deal and this continued with their adventures in Avengers.I think over the years, many of us have become quite endeared to all of the Avengers characters, they are almost household names and each new Marvel entry is welcomed with considerable fanfare. Thor: The Dark World is no exception.The story begins by introducing us to the Dark Elves led by Malekith in a time before Thor and Odin. Bor, father of Odin, managed to stop Malekith from using an energy known as the Aether to return the universe to the darkness it once knew before there was creation. The Aether was hidden and the story fell into legend and fable.However, as the alignment of the planets approaches once again, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), now residing in London, inadvertently makes a discovery that is going to draw her straight into the heart of Thor's latest adventure. Thor is forced to return to Earth and even bring Jane back to Asgard where the Asgardians are given something of a rude awakening. They soon realize that the Dark Elves they remember from their bedtime stories are very real and have once again returned to try and throw the universe back into darkness.This is a great adventure with real consequence. We are reminded that although perceived to be gods by people on Earth during the time of Vikings, Asgardians can be hurt, can be injured, and they frequently do. Thor has to muster more than just physical strength to try and defeat the Dark Elves and it is not without some dire consequences. More than once I found myself wiping away a manly tear from my eye. Thankfully, Thor has the assistance of all his friends from the original movie and they play no small part in helping him try and restore order to the nine realms.I enjoyed once again seeing these characters that I've grown to love and I was happy to see that this movie can be enjoyed as a complete story in its own right, not serving to be just a set up for the next Avengers movie. There is a healthy dose of well-timed humour, which helps to balance the otherwise dark overtones of the story. Performances are great all round, continuing the old world Shakespearean style of banter we have come to expect from Asgardians. I particularly loved some of the imagery seen on Asgard, seeing their world, how they live, watching Thor and Jane meander around the charming streets of this beautiful alien world.I felt Thor seemed somewhat underpowered in this outing, especially after seeing him topple cities with his hammer Mjolnir previously, but this may simply be a reflection of how powerful his adversaries are this time.What I did feel was weak were the 3D effects, so save yourself a buck or two and just watch it in a standard 2D digital screening unless you really want to see the extended Captain America Winter Soldier trailer which is attached to the 3D screening.Another homerun for Marvel, I strongly recommend you catch this on the big screen and, it goes almost without saying, stay right to the end of the credits as there may be more than one golden egg waiting for you.Check it out!Rating 8 out of 10FOR THIS AND OTHER REVIEWS CHECK OUT MAXIMUMEXTREME.NET",Thor - The Dark World

420,seannasuti,It may be one of the weaker MCU films but it's still enjoyable,8,17 April 2017,"I've always argued that there's yet to be a 'bad' MCU film. Have there been weak ones? Sure! But, at the very least, the weakest entries still have things about them that make them worthwhile. 'Thor: The Dark World' is one of the prime examples of this. However, it still has just enough in it to make it an enjoyable enough minor outing in the MCU.In some ways, this film actually improves upon its predecessor. More time is spent in the Nine Realms than on Earth and the visual effects and action sequences are both improved upon. Plus, any scene between Thor and Loki is a major highlight.However, as far as what happens in it, it doesn't really contribute much to the overall lore of the MCU aside from a few twist reveals. Also, it, unfortunately, has the weakest villain in the entire MCU in the form of Malekith. Christopher Eccleston is sadly wasted in the role, restricted by makeup and an elvish language. Despite what it may seem, he proves to be a lackluster threat for Thor and company to deal with. Clearly, the increased screen time of fan-favorite Loki affected Malekith's role in the story.Like 'Iron Man 2', this is clearly one of the MCU films that was most affected by the infamous creative committee, and in some cases, it does show. But 'terrible'? Absolutely not. I will say, though, that this one doesn't really warrant as many re-watches as some of the other MCU films.",Thor - The Dark World
421,ammarjamal,What did I just watch?,5,15 November 2013,"Personally I am more of a DC fan than Marvel, but it seems like everyone has been pressuring me to watch the second installment of the Thor movies, and...it was disappointing.Thor 2 is directed by ""game of thrones"" director Alan Taylor who proved that he has a future in Hollywood, Alan Taylor is a great director, Thor 2 looked beautiful and the fight scenes were great. Sadly Alan Taylor's great directing could not overcome Thor 2's disappointing story, in my opinion it is too early to make a Thor film that takes place in Asgard, but it made sense because it seems that the Thor franchise can not survive without Loki. The film felt very messy as we learn about Malakith, a villain who barely appears in the film, the viewers just have no connections what so ever with the MAIN VILLAIN of the movie. Instead the writers focused on Loki who was amazing in this film, but the countless ""is this guy Loki?"" confusion was way too much, the viewer was unable to relate, first it was Loki against Thor (in the cell), then it was Loki with Thor (while going to the secret passage) then it was Loki against Thor, but we find out it was a trick...then Loki ""dies"" BUT we later find out he betrayed Thor...that was Way too much ""Lokiception"". In the film we see a slight tension between Sif and Jane Foster which I found to be completely unnecessary because except for the awkward looks they give each other, nothing really happens between them. The humor in Thor 2 is outstanding, but it gets repetitive at times. It felt like some points in this film were just not necessary at all! I understand that the writers wanted to make a point but the scenes were very briefly explained (the date in the beginning of the film). Although Chris Hemsworth did a good job as Thor, but it's starting to get old, I don't get the feeling i get when watching Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man or Hugh Jackman as the wolverine. But Tom Hiddleston is brilliant as ever. Overall, Thor: The dark world is an overrated film, where we see messy writing, mediocre acting (except for Tom Hiddleston) and unnecessary tension between the characters. Although Thor 2 had some flaws it is still worth watching Alan Taylor's outstanding directing in the film.",Thor - The Dark World
422,seans_life,A well done comic related movie.,7,10 May 2014,"A really enjoyable movie and decent 3D effects in it although not over the top but I definitely oh'ed and ah'ed watching the movie. The graphics combined with great acting made for a very fun viewing. The combat definitely looked great with all the special effects added. The stone creature Thor absolutely obliterated was outstanding looking and that scene where he was defeated the stone creature was pretty funny. In fact I think on the subject of funny they did a good job of adding light hearted moments in this film without it feeling forced and not ending up corn ball.The main characters not from Earth were interesting. Thor, Loki and Odin had an interesting family dynamic going on. It kept me interested. I also did have my heart strings pulled when Thor's mom was killed. The funeral / ceremony to honour her death was very interesting and I wonder what all the parts of the ceremony meant. In regards to the ending to this movie it left me shocked and wondering what I missed. I definitely want to go back and look and see if I can figure out how Loki did what he did. I definitely will be interested to see the next movie if there is one planned.In regards to the acting it was what it should be. I would say that playing Thor had to be difficult and to not have it turn out cheese ball is an accomplishment for Chris Hemsworth.I should also mention that the scene where Loki, Tom Hiddleston, and Thor, Chris Hemsworth, fought together and supposedly the character Loki died well I thought that was really well played. Outstanding. Another example of where action/combat in this film shined.Let me finally say I was a person who knew nothing of this story coming in as I don't know the whole Marvel Comics thing and yet I found watching the film extremely enjoyable and in the end wanted more.I am going to give the movie a 7 out of 10.",Thor - The Dark World
423,kees_cornelisse477,made me remind of Star Wars,4,6 August 2014,"I first like to say that I enjoyed the movie and it's a very good sequel to the 1st one and the Avengers. I think it's also better than the first because I like the story better and there are more twists to the story, the first one was pretty straight forward. This one's got action, drama, comedy which is all used very well and everyone that is someone have their good moments. Thing is that the alien worlds and space battles made me think of the Star Wars battles, I really like Star Wars and I didn't really wanted to see it in this movie, that is what made me dislike it a little. And of course the use of ""epicness"" as in all avenger-like movies is just a little much, but I accept it and still enjoyed it. In the end, I will recommend it to everyone who enjoys a good superhero movie and I'll most likely see it again soon because I like watching movies that I like a few times.",Thor - The Dark World

425,jamielee_uob,A dim light in a dark world...,7,21 May 2019,"The best way to describe this film is....hmmmm? The plot was indecisive for me, and scrappy! It was as if there was never meant to be a sequel to Thor...but they had success in the last one so asked Stevie wonder to knit a movie together...and this was it!The action scenes were impressive as always, and the beautiful Natalie Portman is always a plus...but I can't help feel this may have just crossed the line of too much fantasy!On the other hand..certain elements of the plot did impress me. The emotional scenes of a family torn apart, and the introduction of new creatures and mythical relics seem OK to me...This really is a film which I think needs rewatching to fully grasp the elements...the cliffhanger ending is always a Hollywood classic but can't help but that was a bit farfetched...judgement on this film will be more concise once I know the true depth of what is to come

426,jamiepick-16042,Mediocre MCU Film that Deserves a Thor Star Rating (Sorry),4,26 June 2021,"Thor The Dark World Is Probably one of, if not, the worst MCU Film in the franchise. It isn't a bad movie, it just doesn't feel quite like a marvel film and falls in comparison to the comic books. Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston and Anthony Hopkins Saves This Film, Brian Tyler's Music Score also saves this film since his OST For lots of other films are amazing, The mid credit scene was awesome, Some of the scenes do work really well and Some of the visual effects were decent.However, this film still fails in comparison to the comics and has a lot of problems unlike its other movies. Loki had a plot twist. It was said that he would team up with Thor, but in the movie they don't. Natalie Portman's acting was also pretty bad, Gone is Thor's and Jane's unpredictability and much of the Romantic relationship and originality of the first movie. It acted like from Jurassic Park 3 where Ellie Sattler and Alan grant became just good friends. This relationship was just separated. The villain Malekith was just original. It looked like a regular Villian you see in modern movies. It doesn't even link as well to its comic books. Some of the scenes were dumb. But The biggest problem about this film is Chris Hemsworth as acting here. While I do like him, it looked like he was getting bored playing as him. Gone is his epic ness and much of his originality from the first movie.Overall, this film while it isn't bad by all means, this film is definitely by far one of the weakest in the MCU And just skip this if you've not or have seen it. You should see Thor 2011 or Thor Ragnarock instead.Rating: 4.5/10.",Thor - The Dark World
427,fanpepox,Betting on a darker and more serious tone is useless if the plot just isn't rich enough.,6,6 November 2021,"Thor: The Dark World fails on the same points as its predecessor, but in an even more remarkable way. Although the dark tone suits it well for the most part and the main character is given plenty to do, the film succumbs under its own weight trying to focus on an unsubstantial villain with no development and unnecesary plot twists that are only there to push the story forward. The action sequences are an improvement over the ones on 2011's Thor, but other than that, little else can be said about this forgettable entry.",Thor - The Dark World
428,mohamed_tarek,Loki : The Dark World :),10,31 December 2013,"Thor : The Dark World is a must see movie. It gave me hope in Marvel Studios after the disappointment I have seen in The Wolverine and Iron Man 3. Amazing movie , excellent story , great action and good slight of Comedy. The cast was amazing. Chris Hemsworth is THOR , no one could have done it better and he is actually much better than in Part One. Tom Hiddleston ( Loki ) was simply amazing and without him the movie wouldn't make it. He makes the villain someone you want to be which is rare. Heimdall ( Idris Elba ) was more involved than he was in part one which I liked it. If you haven't seen it yet then wait till the end or till they sent you out of the cinema cause there is too more scenes , one of them is worth seeing.Again LOKI was amazing with him expect the unexpected :) , you gonna love him.",Thor - The Dark World

But what this film does good is to provide epic high-level entertainment, if you are the type of person who could relate to such kind of a fantasy movie. Chris Hemsworth is great. Natalie Portman makes a solid performance as usual.Only thing I did not like was the voice effects they used on Chris who sounds a bit like a robot. Not necessary.",Thor - The Dark World
430,ar-anmolrawat,Entertaining but with flaws,6,9 November 2013,"Pros: Its Thor and it will always be entertaining. Comic scenes are perfect and make you laugh. The second half has some great visual effects and good action. The climax fight is what most of the people dint like in the reviews but I loved it. Chris Hemsworth has owned the character and I can't imagine anyone else in that outfit now. Loki is funny and intriguing. Overall a good package but not as good as the first installment.Cons: Comic scenes were good but there were too many. If you wanted it to be dark, you will be a bit disappointed. As a character, Malekith was not developed properly. The story does not revolve much around him even though he is the main villain of the movie. The first half was a bit dull as compared to the second half. The 3d effects are not up to the mark and i was feeling irritated watching it in 3D as there was nothing so great about them that I had to watch everything with a tint of black.Overall if you like Thor, you will like the movie. He is my favorite Marvel character (of course after Tony Stark). Natalie Portman has nothing much to do except being a mess or the source of problems for Thor and Asgard.The post credit scene reveals a bit about Avengers: Age of Ultron and was worth waiting for.The post post credit scene is something you may as well skip as it's definitely not worth the wait.I liked the movie but wanted it to be better.7 on 10",Thor - The Dark World
431,DarksIayer,"This movie, I like it! ANOTHER!!!",9,24 November 2013,"Finally we get to see the full power of Thor unleashed! But what really made this movie great was Tom Hiddleston as Loki, and Christopher Ecclestion as Malekith. Both were great villains, and I loved the way Loki played off of Thor. I also loved seeing Thor and Malekith duke it out in the final fight as well. Seeing more Idris Elba is always a plus. I just wish they would have spent less time on Midgard. Other than that, easily the second-best MCU movie. Make sure you stay for a crazy reveal in the last scene, as well as an mid-credit scene that has huge implications for the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe! 10/10",Thor - The Dark World
432,lpklump,Thor The Dark World was terrific!,8,26 March 2014,"Thor The Dark World was a thrilling sequel that takes you into space and all nine realms.This movie is intense, and makes you have all different emotions.Chirs Hemsworth who played ""Thor"" is such an awesome character that is very wise and very strong. I thought that Natalie Portman who played ""Jane Foster"" did better in this movie than the first one because she was cooler and tougher. Tom Hiddleston who played ""Loki"" he can be dramatic, funny, and mean. He has some great personalities. Christopher Eccleston who played ""Malekith"" was one of the toughest super villains in the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 2"" so far. He was unstoppable compared to Loki.I thought that Brian Tyler did a great job of making ""Thor The Dark World"" soundtrack and it's themes, it sounded beautiful.This movie should've been the beginning of the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 2"", because ""Iron Man 3"" SUCKED, big time!!",Thor - The Dark World

Loki was the only standout.The explanation about how the girl got the ether virus was stupid.The floating and teleportation was just dumb.Thor beating up his own army was dumb.90's movies seems to get the storyline and acting better than these current crappy films with bloated budgets and technology.,Thor - The Dark World
434,EvolBob,Did not live up to expectations,2,31 October 2013,"We had a midnight viewing last night (Wednesday 30th Oct midnight)and for some reason there were less than 20 patrons, so that was the first warning sign. Then there was 30 minutes of adverts and promotions - okay maybe I exaggerate just a tad, but I was just so excited to see a movie I've waited so long to see, every second of delay was torture.When the movie started the real torture started. Probably I'm getting too old and I've seen all this shat before, I just expected something different for a change. If your mentality is below 12 you might like it, otherwise it is old hat with unimaginative villains that were even too far fetched for a cartoon.By the time Thor was half-way through I was bored and couldn't give a flying sardine who did or didn't get killed. The directors (I don't even want to know) obviously couldn't take the scrip seriously (and who could blame them) and it showed with idiotic out of place comedy. I believe this was done just to distract the long suffering viewer, except it did remind me of a dumbed down version of Dr Who - if that is possible! The bottom line here is credibility, no one in this work of fart could act there with a straight face. There was never a doubt the Universe was going be saved - I'm not kidding - it is this stupid!",Thor - The Dark World
435,fossicle,80 Yr Old Pair of Underwear,1,1 March 2014,I liked the first Thor but this one was a total failure.The plot to this movie is as thin as an 80 Yr Old Pair of Underwear that has been worn by a homeless dude for the past quarter century.I mean thin. The beginning was difficult to understand. I even attempted to use closed captioning to get the drift of the beginning.The only redeeming features of the movie were Loki and the two sub-characters who worked for Jane Foster.It sounded like Chris Hemsworth just graduated from Woolloomooloo Grammar given his thick Aussie accent (which was not as pronounced in the first movie).,Thor - The Dark World
436,skeecats,Not great but not terrible either.,6,10 February 2014,"The only reason I am writing this review is because the reviews I have seen here are either someone hated it totally or thought it was the best movie they ever saw. The truth is somewhere in the middle, Thor will never be the best movie you ever saw, nor will it be the worst ever, if you think its the worst ever then you haven't seen Dragonball evolution. What can i say about this movie, There was far too much going on to connect with the characters in too short a time.Yet still, the acting scenes and action were solid. The movie just lacked emotional substance, which you would expect from a Thor movie. Things could have been explored a little differently especially when it comes to romance and some other of Thor's relationships including Natalie Portman's character, Jane. There was a lot of one dimensionality to the characters with the exception of Loki. Other than that this movie was solid fun.I would suggest renting it or having it in your DVD collection, for that boring Saturday. It isn't a memorable one but it will wind the time away and give you a few laughs and giggles. That and Thor just kicks BUTT. :)",Thor - The Dark World
437,svanlijnden,"Good Gods, bad MacGuffins!",7,2 January 2014,"The guy with the big hammer is back! He is still mostly the straight man in a story that mixes Shakespearian family drama with mythical mumbo-jumbo. Mind you, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and his Asgardian kin are not Gods, because that could cause all sorts of controversy among the believers of various 'legit' religions. The movie takes the Lord of the Rings approach by throwing you right into an epic battle with explanatory voice-over. It introduces the movies villains economically, making no compromises to people who may need a moment to transition from their daily routine to this fantastical world. You'll either have to go with it or just go.In time, you do stop worrying about the plausibility and practical aspects of life in Asgard and the other realms. What becomes more of a problem is some really silly science being used on the earthbound side of the story. The mythical worlds are so far removed from reality that applying credibility seems inappropriate. But hanging a whole lot of gibberish pseudo-science off two fake-looking devices with a dubious- looking remote control , and making the grand finale hinge on the vague workings of it, is annoying. Sure, I can understand that these doohickeys simply do what the script needs them to do, but they are such obvious plot devices that the lazy writing is hard to miss. The writers have some fun by playing around with the effect the thingamajigs cause, and even use it for some good comic relief, but it does throw you out of the story. The writers expose themselves too much as puppet masters.Now, all this makes it sound like I didn't have a good time watching Thor: The Dark World. But it is fun, in a cheesy, over-the-top kinda way. Most of the cast from the first movie is brought back in, including the great Tom Hiddleston as Loki, though I don't quite like how the movie handles him. In-between this movie and The Avengers, he does seem to be spending an awful lot of time hanging around in a cell. And being a trickster, a character you can never get a handle on, he risks going from intriguing to boring in the end. Nathalie Portman is back as the love-interest, brought together 'by fate' according to Thor, though I'd say it was the script, working really hard to maneuver her into place. I like Portman in the role and it's always a joy watching her slap people in the face. Her assistant Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) works well as the comic relief, though the funniest moment involves a very quick and unexpected cameo from one of Thor's former comrades-in-arms. Idris Elba also returns, as gate-keeper Heimdall, a lot more well-known by now and still looking hot despite the colored lenses. I look forward to seeing him in the Mandela biopic.The main problem with Thor: The Dark World is one of tone. Sometimes it takes itself very seriously, sometimes not at all. That can work if the comedy is in the dialog and the interplay between characters. But as a viewer, you do want to feel that the writers are dedicated to telling a solid, well-thought out story and are not just having a laugh.@PopCultJunk",Thor - The Dark World
438,chakor-74657,"Not the worst, but not the best either",6,30 December 2018,"For the most part I enjoyed this movie for what it was, but the biggest flaw with it is that it has a hard time justifying its existence beyond being a sequel for the sole purpose of having a sequel. The best parts are easily Loki's development, but he's honestly not in the film that much. The problem is that, beyond Loki, it just isn't very interesting and the plot is utterly uninspired and predictable.While I actually rather enjoyed the cheesiness of Makekith and the Dark Elves, as characters they were still unimpressive. Another thing that did annoy me is how Asgard no longer looked gold and grand as it did in the first Thor movie by Branagh and instead it looked like your average Game of Thrones set (which is appropriate since the director was also involved with GoT). Without Loki around, Thor's character here honestly isn't very interesting and he just feels like a generic superhero. The score is good but it still isn't anywhere near as memorable as Patrick Doyle's score for the first film.Overall it is just an OK movie and a fine watch when binging the other Marvel films. It is far from being Marvel's absolute worst film as many Marvel fans and nonfans alike proclaim, but it's still a massive step downward from what the first Thor movie was and it really didn't add much to the MCU as a whole other than the Reality Stone/Aether and Loki usurping the throne of Asgard.",Thor - The Dark World
439,ryleyjoyes,Just watch a summary video,5,30 April 2020,"This movie is so incredibly awfully boring but was merely a speed bump for the franchise. Like I said, not worth the watch. Marvel tried but failed, just move on to the next movie.",Thor - The Dark World
440,jgraff-20249,Underrated and Over-Criticized,8,26 January 2020,"I think for many people this movie falls under the category of ""That movie I watched once and forgot about, therefore it must be bad"". Well, I love this movie in that it takes a deep dive into Asgardian history, lore, and just the visuals in general. This is a beautiful film that shows off Asgard whenever it suits the story, and I have no problem with that at all. I'd also bring up that this movie offers a lot of development for Loki, and Thor: Ragnarok wouldn't make any sense without his character development in this film. I think post-avengers Loki is my favorite version of the character, he is at peak snarkiness, but we also see actual emotion and sorrow after Frigga's death, which turned out to be a heart-wrenching funeral despite her not being a very developed character. This movie also makes Frigga's appearance in Endgame all the more impactful. Thor receives further development as well. We see him change from being a vengeful war seeking petulant prince into having to become responsible and selfless, even if it means committing treason against his home. This time, Odin is the one making irrational decisions. I think people also forget that this movie introduced an INFINITY STONE. So if nothing else, it's still quite an important film because the Aether is in no other film until Infinity War.
Also I'd give the score in this movie an 11/10 if I could. Brian Tyler's score is gorgeous and matches the film perfectly.",Thor - The Dark World

442,Our_Feature_Presentation,Thor The Dark World: Three words: TOO MUCH COMEDY!,6,17 January 2014,"Thor: The Dark World. Now with most new movies I review this review may contain SPOILERS so read at your own risk. Thor: The Dark World improves on many flaws of the first Thor, like probably my biggest problem with the first Thor was that the 9 realms were way to polished and neat in this movie the realms look more like actual places that have dirt and muck. And also Asgard looks much more Viking-like and that makes a whole lot of sense considering the Norse mythology was created by Vikings. In this movie Thor got to do more Thor-like things with his power, and be more of a hero. Thor The Dark World also threw in more creatures they all looked pretty cool especially the secondary villain Kurse, he was big, and violent a real Challenger to Thor sadly I felt he didn't get enough screen time. Thats one of the problems with the movie, the villains were really cool but had no were near enough screen time, like Malekith, great design from adapting a comic to a movie, cool powers, good threat, worthy enemy, threatening but in the end he was only on screen for like 17 minutes, I fell they should've cut out parts of the Earth scenes and replaced it with more Malekith and Kurse scenes. On Earth there were two characters in particular that the whole movie could have doe without, the two interns (I know they probably have names but I didn't care enough to remember them) they annoyed the crap out of me, I hated them really took the movie down a notch. But out of the negatives there were some positives that outweighed them, the character of Thor was much more heroic and godlike, Loki's back and he's good in the movie and doesn't overstay his welcome, the fights were great very imaginative especially the final fight with portals and realm jumping. Now some cameos that I noticed of course Stan Lee had one and it was great as all the rest, and the one that's probably the best is a Captain America cameo, I wont tell you when were or how it happens but man it's cool. So in the end Thor: The Dark World is better than the first but this is still a flawed movie, but even with the flaws Thor The Dark World gets an 7.5 out of 10.

Robert Downey Jr. was remarkably great in this film. He did something that he didn't do in the other IRON MAN movies. Overall, the movie was unique and funny at some moments. Then, THOR: THE DARK WORLD came out...I didn't get to catch it in the theaters so I downloaded it. I jumped on my couch and turned the TV on.The movie was absolutely spectacular and just plain awesome!! I mean the effects were so revolutionary that it feels like I'm actually in one of the Nine Realms. I loved the performances by Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman.

445,Spiderfan19,Mediocre,7,12 March 2019,"Let's be honest, I dreaded watching this one. It is one of the worst MCU movies in my opinion. The story is meh, the villain is terrible, and the character development is not noticeable outside of Loki. Speaking of Loki, he was definitely the best thing about this movie, but the fact they faked his death is somewhat annoying. I personally think that was where he should have died, it would have fulfilled his character arc throughout the movies, and would have been a satisfying ending to the character. There were some great moments, but the rest of the film wasn't as good. All in all, a pretty mediocre movie with a terrible villain.",Thor - The Dark World

447,toronto_ghostbuster,"Generic and bland, but not terrible",5,21 October 2014,"Thor: The Dark World follows the same formula as all the other big budget block buster franchise sequels. More action, more explosions, more drama, also, more ""grey"". What is it with all the new adventure movies and extremely bland colors? The original Thor managed to keep me interested and excited throughout the entire film, but this time I really didn't find myself having very much concern for any of the characters. Now, I know the plot is important, but It's hard to care about a plot when you don't care if the characters live or die. I found I was bored, and completely uninterested in the usual banter between Thor, Loki and Odin. It's become very dull and predictable. I also never really found myself rooting for anyone, unlike the first film where I found myself rooting for multiple characters. Whatever made the chemistry work in Thor seems to be almost lost in the sequel. The pacing was slow in all the wrong places, and the dialogue in my opinion went from acceptable to corny with nothing in between. All of the comic relief was terrible and did not work. The Chemistry between Thor and Jane lacked sincerity, and Darcy's character actually made me roll my eyes on several occasions. She's pretty much the Jar Jar Binks of this franchise...Just there so the kids can have a character to relate to. What was good about the film? Clearly a lot of effort was put into the visual effects and action sequences, I guess that's worth noting and the plot itself is not bad either. Basically, it's your run of the mill action sequel. Not terrible, but not great either. Just bland. In conclusion, although this is not a great film, it's watchable and if you're someone following the Marvel Universe, it's kind of a must watch as some major events take place.",Thor - The Dark World
448,chrysoberylz,"Fun, Entertaining, Hilarious, and Badass",8,2 November 2013,"Far better than the first movie. Sorry, but I found the first movie is a bit boring... I do not read the comics so I will just write what I know from the movies version. This sequel of Thor (2011) is simply amazing and obviously becomes a movie that you want to watch over and over again like Marvel's The Avengers (2012).The main characters from the first movie come back. With a bit of change in the cast, I think (Zachary Levi!). Begins with a war in the ""space"" between Malekith and Asgard, Loki with handcuffs brought to prison, another battle in present time with the appearance of Asgardian warriors. Thor, of course, came up with a dramatic entrance. Kicking-ass as usual, then the story moved to a peaceful, everyday life in Earth/Midgard. Jane, Darcy (Kat Dennings is still awesome), and Ian (intern!) found a dimension portal as told by a group of kids, Jane disappeared into another world, the Aether made Jane its host, Jane came back to surface, and finally met Thor.Thor brought Jane to Asgard and tried to get out the Aether from Jane's body. But yeah, it is not that easy. Then Malekith invaded Asgard resulting Frigga's death. The scene when Frigga and fallen Asgardian warriors were burnt and brought to afterlife was really awesome and gave me chills. Thor, seeing this, would not just sit around while Malekith and his army brought grieves to Asgard. He asked for Loki's help to escape Asgard. Of course also with the help of Sif, Volstagg, and Fandral. Epic battle with Malekith ending with Loki's death (no, he is not). Thor then came to Earth with Jane and battled Malekith for the last time. With those portals being unstable, some of the teleport scenes are hilarious and awesome at the same time. Malekith was killed after being teleported to Svartalfheim, with Malekith's own ship crashed over him.And do not forget the post-credit scene. There are two of them. Seeing this post credit indicates the possibility for the third movie. Overall, this movie is awesome. Action, drama, comedy, science-fiction, mythology things, you can find all of them in this Thor: The Dark World. All of them are in right position and makes this movie amazing. But with all those amazing things about this movie, it also has a bit of minus side. I think Loki needs more screen time than that, no sign of S.H.I.E.L.D. at all??? (only mentioned once), and why should Frigga dead? Thor: The Dark World is highly recommended. Especially for the fans of Thor, Marvel movies, and action-genre. You will not be disappointed and I am sure you want to watch this over and over again.",Thor - The Dark World

This kind of bad is not the bad that's cool bad, but the bad that makes you feel bad about making yourself watch even a second of something so bad you will spend you life trying to forget how bad it was.",Thor - The Dark World
450,mrfish5000,A film worthy of Thor,9,31 October 2013,"I loved Thor's original introduction, I think Kenneth set a prime example for the mythologies, and this film exceeds and refines the efforts that came before.The score was terrific, characters alive, and the effects stunning. The screenplay balancing humour and emotion stunningly well. Thor: The Dark World is my favourite Avengers outing thus far, Captain America shouldn't disappoint either.Criticism and Spoilers However, I did think that Odin was too solid of a character, not encompassing the mythology of his role, or mirroring examples seen in other Marvel animated movies.Reference to Jodenheim was good, and I hope Loki's 'see you in hell' line will be a reference to his participation in a Surtur storyline for Thor 3, maybe so given Marvel's interest in maintaining his involvement due to his fan following.What I thought should have changed - was that Odin intervene in the end by means of the Tesseract, aka cosmic cube - to combat the aether spread, as it would bring a much more direct contrast to the artifacts, and interest in Odin's armoury again.Iron Man should have at least been in touch somehow, worldwide panic is a big deal lol, but Cap's inclusion was hilarious (and maybe referencing skrulls later), but again is no big deal as Iron Man 3 could have said the same thing about including shield and Cap.I didn't like the fact that the collector was portrayed so strangely, and not introduced, but I'm guessing that will come later. Thor should have fought the horned guy longer, making Malekith a trickier enemy calling for Odin - who would have come down to earth to help, and then coming to terms with human interaction - acknowledging his saving them in the past with the frost giants in himself etc.Also - I think he should have revived Freya with the Cube if it were possible - maybe revealing after Thor and Loki banded together - and locking Loki away (although proud of his progress). And the ending was somewhat misrepresented - I think if Loki was to take over Asgard (which he believably could after that speech) - he would use an artifact, reflecting the scene in Thor with the casket - but I think he should have fled to Jodenheim with the creature at the end.""There is a purpose to everything your father does"" - 9 out of 10, a triumph for the genre.",Thor - The Dark World
451,jbrowning-w,Best marvel movie to date(except iron man and including avengers).,7,3 November 2013,"If you thought that avengers was good, you will be pleasantly surprised with Thor:the dark world. This movie plays tricks that the first set of marvel movies never did. This takes brave steps that change Thor's life and makes you wonder through the rest of the movie what more steps are made. The villain, although very distant to the characters and not as personal as Loki is, Christopher Ecclestone is still a brilliant actor and has a very evil vibe when he plays the role of the evil Dark Elf leader. Overall this is a masterpiece for marvel as I have seen marvel's movies as nothing special until now(accept for iron man). So I recommend watching Thor: The Dark World as it has an epic cliffhanger and gets you really excited for the next step in marvel's movie franchise.",Thor - The Dark World
452,mdilday94,The plot needs improvement,6,13 December 2018,"The first Thor film was good, not great, this movie however is not so much. The plot/story was mediocre, the main villain Malekith was bland, not to mention he and his minions resembled rejected Doctor Who villains, in the comics they had medieval weapons like the Asgardians did and Malekith was a magician, but in this film, they have alien weapons and mount on space ships, I don't mind changes but this shoves the limit. The best parts of the movie was graphics, they were amazing, the battle scenes were also cool and Loki was entertaining. Don't expect too much from this film.",Thor - The Dark World

This movie clearly is one big predictable run for profit for the movie company, director, and actors: nothing but clichés in every aspect and detail, cheesy dialog, silly sound effects, pretty faces, buff bodies, over-dramatization, stupidity, and the list goes on and on and on. This movie is a travesty, a cartoonist's public rape of Nordic mythology for money. This movie is sucking up to a well-mapped audience which has no care for quality, as long as they get their 10 minutes of something cool to tell their friends about. By being in this movie, Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins, Rene Russo, and Stellan Skarsgård have tripped and fallen from any and all artistic grace that they have earned over the years. Shame, shame, shame.",Thor - The Dark World
454,christineyoon,"Thor: Definitely worth seeing, but not as entertaining as the latest hit movies",5,12 August 2016,"Thor 2 was a thrilling sequel to Marvel's Thor movie series, and the movie branches from Thor and The Avengers. Loki, depicted by Tom Hiddleston, plays an important role in saving the world, which is unexpected because he played someone who tried to destroy the Earth in Thor and The Avengers. Jane Foster, portrayed by Natalie Portman, played a more useful person and proved her brilliance while working with Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth. The top box office movie taught me some Norse mythology, useful for English class, proving the film not only fun but educational. I learned that there were brother and rival gods named Thor and Loki who had a father named Odin. They all lived in Asgard. Tom Hiddleston fans rejoice!This movie, however, ranks between unnatural and natural. On previous reviews I've defined what I call natural, which is when a superhero movie makes the audience feel as if they are part of its world, among the bystanders. While this film was wildly entertaining, it does not line up well among the other superhero movie greats, such as Spider-Man with Tobey Maguire and the new Marvel and DC Comics movies. Lately, these movies have been getting more and more action-packed and adventurous, causing my previous ratings, such as this one, to go down. While Chris Hemsworth definitely fits the role physically, the acting was not exactly on par; at least, it still caused me to cringe a bit.This movie ranks a 5, only because movies such as the Revenant are ranked 10 and other comic book movies have been much more interesting and captivating than this one.",Thor - The Dark World
455,jcucchisi-77-755989,The worst Marvel universe film but still ok,7,28 July 2019,Thor: The Dark World is a film with too many different tones and doesn't know what it wants to be. Some of the film is like Shakespeare is space (which in this movie it's not as cool as it sounds). Other parts of it want to be a buddy cop movie with Thor and Loki and these scenes are the best part of the movie. It also try's (but fails) to develop more of Thor and Jane's love story. The villain was very forgettable and boring and the plot is kind of like the plot from Transformers 3 (though its done much better in this movie). Still most of the action is enjoyable (other than the final battle) and like I mentioned before Thor and Loki's chemistry was great and saved the movie for me.,Thor - The Dark World
456,sbsfm-11538,Fantastic... to me.,8,27 April 2018,Thor the Dark World was the first Marvel movie I've seen and the first at the movies and I really liked it. Sure the main villain was not great but that didn't destroy the movie. I still like the movie to this day and like it more and more each time a watch it everyone has their own opinions and this is mine.,Thor - The Dark World
457,perzin,Still enjoyable!,7,22 June 2021,"This is one of the weakest MCU films, but that doesn't mean it's bad. Thor: The Dark World falls flat in the villain department with Malekith as the big bad. His motivations are the typical ""haha I'm evil and want to destroy everything just cause"". Despite this, it's still an enjoyable film. The scenes with Thor and Loki together do for some great character development, specially in Loki's side. We get to understand him a bit more and it's nice to see what's become of him after the final battle in the first Avengers film.",Thor - The Dark World
458,Fanboy218,VERY VERY entertaining!,8,4 November 2013,"Before going to the theater, I expected this to be a great entertaining movie not necessarily better than the first thor, but an entertaining blockbuster, and it was still much better than what I expected! I had a blast ! The action were very entertaining, the universe that the director has made were beautiful. It was also really funny (though some jokes just seem too forced), and the script was also well written. The first 60 minutes was a great build up, and the next 60 minutes were just better, in other words this movie was entertaining from start to finish. This movie's surely on par with Iron Man and even The Avengers (not necessarily better), and without a doubt better than the first Thor. This movie had a lot of flaws, but it doesn't matter since it's so entertaining. It might just be the best superhero movie of the year (though I really liked man of steel).If u either like action movies or superhero movies, you must definitely watch the film. Some people might not like this film because they mostly don't really follow about what's going on or what's happening in the asgard world, if u are one of these people, do yourself a favor and watch this movie for a 2nd time!! It would be much much better if u really know what's going on since the start.",Thor - The Dark World
459,ChaosStar,Hammer can't break the anvil.,3,26 April 2014,"I wanted to give this sequel a shot as the two attempts I tried with the first movie failed miserably to please but I had heard from a friend that this one is different, I know not how.. From the beginning we have a poor plot, like most Marvel movies. For some reasons, Dark futuristic space Elves want to wipe out the world that they failed eons ago. Taking too much out of the great battle of the Lord The Rings, the Elves are broken and exiled, promising to return with a weapon to destroy and rule all life *cough one ring* Meanwhile somewhere else in the space time spectrum, Thor and his cliché mundane battle brethren who seem as out of place as the swords and axes with their stupid cross over space ships, grenades and guns, are waging war with other.. things not explained. Returning after certain victory with Thor on their side, our Northen hero in space gets an itch that tells him that whats her face, Jane I think, comes into danger by stupidly touching an alien and obviously evil substance. Oddly enough she isn't abducted by a secret American syndicate, something I thought was definitely going to happen with this plot but alas, it's more simple. Jane is brought to Valhalla as they are the ones to remove said evil substance where we are sadly subjected to Hokins horrible over acting( a shame), Loki being as ordinary as ever( really we have seen this character in a lot of movies, The black sheep of the ruling family intent on taking it over) Loki is in jail, Loki is suddenly not in jail, fight between siblings, more fights, more fights in more stupid sword and gun cross overs, fights on Earth and some professor without pants, obviously a Stan lee cameo ( the only laugh) and more fighting with a nice little boring love moment, all wrapped up in a foreseeable and weak excuse for a plot twist. Pretty visuals... that's really about it that's worth it. I was sad to see Chris D in it. I really just wish movies with such a huge budget put money to novels or more thought out comics with better plots and less stupid content.Thor had great visuals, Decent enough typical blockbuster action and an Australian. 3/10",Thor - The Dark World
460,ThePeruvianPost,The WORST MCU Experience to date!,5,11 July 2019,"""The second instalment might have amended its visual effects and the development of some characters as Dr. Erik Selvig, as well. However, the result was an earnest film, which, in spite of struggling way too hard to provide entertainment and laughs, ended up being another undistinguished superhero experience""After watching the first instalment and the first crossover in ""The Avengers"", I was hoping that this second phase, which began with Iron Man 3 and concluded with Ant-Man, could provide almost the same quality as the predecessors, it is to say, some bettered features. Disconsolately, this prediction was only achieved with Captain America and the novel Guardians of the Galaxy. It is not to declare this bunch was terrible, but unsatisfactory overall. Why? Because it stepped back on narration, unnecessary extended scenes and, the worst of all, it tried to bring to the forefront themes where the charm of our favourite actors are not shown. For example, this one will go to Loki, a demi-god whose evilness is incomparable but never leaves his challenging field towards Thor, his charming and comedic sense of humour. What have you actually spotted in the film? Basically, the opposite. As the film moves on, you will sense this dark theme is the main reason why it does not prosper whatsoever, because it is leaving what makes Thor such an awesome Avenger and what makes Asgard a place where everyone wanted to live in. The single moment I get the chance to watch Asgard, as it truly is, was the very beginning when the people was celebrating alongside the king and the royal family, a place of unity, family and mostly love... after all, the people wanted to see that ""Asgard is not a place but its people"".The villain's aspirations were OK, taking into account the same I-want-to-rule-over-the-universe cliché. Nevertheless, considering his power, he could have been an interesting villain (better than Ultron) because he wanted the realms to be ruled, in other words, a great part of the universe. Finally, the best thing about the film was the earth scientific gang which, without whom, the film would have got a worse score.",Thor - The Dark World
461,rachogrady,Perfect movie,10,11 May 2019,The sound effects were awesome! What happened was excellent! Loved that little trick Thor and Loki did. The dark elf was cool and the infinity stone. Just needed to have more screen time for certain scenes,Thor - The Dark World
462,sqdb,Plot less Piece Of Garbage,1,27 March 2014,"I don't write many reviews but, after seeing this crime against cinema, I felt compelled to voice my opinion, in the hope of saving potential viewers time and money. Basically, I saw the first Thor film when it came out and it didn't exactly blow my mind, so I wasn't expecting much from this film. My gut feelings proved to be justified. I cannot believe all of the praise this film has received and even most of the critics go on about how great it is, which proves how little they know. This film is a two-hour special effects show, with no plot and actors that are too unbelievably good-looking to be true. I would imagine that this film would only appeal to comic-book nerds or 10-year old boys and anyone else would be bored stiff after the first hour. I am angry that this crap ever got the green light from Hollywood and angry at myself for wasting my time and money to watch it. I have seen better DTV films than this, which were made with worse actors and a much lower budget. Avoid this crap like your life depended on it and, if you really must see it, wait until it turns up on TV. At least then you won't have wasted any money to see it. Simply awful.",Thor - The Dark World
463,j-pryde,An unfocused mess,5,4 November 2013,"The first Thor was probably one of Marvel's more trickier movies since it centered heavily around Norse mythology. To make it work in the ""real"" world was a massive task. Integrating a billionaire playboy who doubles as a tech-powered superhero, or a scientist who turns into a green rage monster was easier to accomplish than the fantastic world of Asgard, Gods & Monsters.Credit must go to Kenneth Brannagh who found the right balance between the fantastic and ""real"" (that's a stretch anyways) world. Furthermore, Brannagh focused on the characters instead of bombastic vfx (he still provided tons of beautiful shot visuals though).His replacement Alan Taylor however goes in the opposite direction and favors stylish visuals over character development. Worse still, the pacing and tone are all over the place.The Dark World tries to hard to provide the same brand of humor Joss Whedon is known for but fails to deliver the laughs, or they are rather misplaced.Bottom line: It's a too unfocused movie that suffers from a weak script and a director who tries too many things at the same time.",Thor - The Dark World
464,CinematicThylacine,This Movie Could Have Been Great But Sadly It's.....Low-Key,6,23 April 2014,"To be truly honest there were a lot of neat elements and scenes in this movie, however they were bogged down by several other groan-worthy elements. First let me point out that I thought that Thor (2011) was one of the more impressive of the recent Marvel movies, mostly because of my liking of Norse mythology (no matter how Hollywood-ized it may be). Going into the theater I expected a great movie, though I had some small doubts deep within myself after seeing Avengers. Let me first start with what was good:Tom Hiddleston once again steals the show with his top-notch performance as Loki. Thankfully I was glad to see that they once again made him an in-depth character instead of a one-dimensional cliché boring villain like he was in Avengers. The scenes taking place in the Nine Realms were really breathtaking and unique, I commend the art department for their world design. A lot of the action scenes (outside of Earth) were well choreographed and directed, with enough elements to keep things interesting. The dynamic between Thor and Loki was particularly interesting in this movie, and I was glad that it went beyond ""I hAtez yoi for-eva cause you waz da bad gui in Avengers"".The villains had an interesting dark ascetic too them, almost a strange medieval Gothic mixed with HR Giger and just a splash of Elder Scrolls daedra. At first their ""Teletubbie"" masks were a bit distracting to me, but over time I sort of ignored it for the sake of the movie.Now then, we shall unfortunately go onto the elements that brought the movie down (at least for me):The constant Avengers references got old really quickly, I mean REALLY quickly. Yes we get it, the Avengers happened, now can you please shut up about New York and focus on the current bad guys?A majority of the Earth scenes were slow, boring, dull, and took away screen time from the rest of the film. Perhaps the English tourism council paid Marvel tons of money just to film a majority of the scenes at famous landmarks in England.Jane and the scientists, to me, REALLY bogged this movie down and took away precious time that could be given to other more interesting characters. The constant cussing science assistant and goofy ""were are my pants"" jokes got old pretty quickly.Not harp on Anthony Hopkins, but his portrayal of Odin felt somewhat ""phoned in"". Almost during the entire movie he looked bored and detached, perhaps it could just be the writing and script though.The main dark-elf villain, Malekith the Accursed, seemed to have something lacking to his character. This however is true for most villains in Marvel movies, seems like DC movies get all the well developed villains....The final battle and climax! Oh goodness, I could not take that seriously whatsoever. I mostly blame the lame ""paradox"" gimmicks and the fact that it was taking place *SPOILERS* in the middle of an English university where a bunch of uniformed British students are hanging out by the library windows saying ""By golly! That's bloody daft right there!"".In conclusion I would say that if you want to watch this movie, give it a try, but don't expect a great movie.",Thor - The Dark World

I watched it merely to continue advancing the plots of all of the Marvel films, so that I will not be behind for the highly anticipated Avengers 2. Once again, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), an ordinary denizen finds herself in the midst of an intergalactic crisis. The improbabilities continue as she miraculous seems to have all answers to all of the perilous situations that she winds up in.The biggest highlight of the film was Tom Hiddleston's portrayal of the ever-charismatic Loki. Time and time again, I asked myself where were all of the other avengers and superheroes that exist in that universe. As with all Marvel films, there were two ""secret"" endings during the credits, which was a delight and an enigma together.",Thor - The Dark World
483,manuscriptna,"Great action, hilarious comedy, and character improvement make this a hit",8,6 November 2013,"Thor: The Dark World is, in short, a hit. With a new and different threat, the battle takes place behind the lines, in wastelands, and on metropolis Earth, rather than the cold world and small town scene of the first film. Trickery, subtlety, and cunning take the place of brute force this time, and it's a good direction to take.The characters, for the large part now established, were furthered well. Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) was played well, but could have spoken up a great deal more near the end. It should have been more shocking when he finally spoke English, in fact I don't recall the exact moment he started.The action in this film was great, but skipped a few beats at times, which is forgivable this time with Loki's interchanges with Thor. Marvel did meet my expectations with intermittent comedy, once again. This sequel was full of it, and each time it was written and performed very well, and got a laugh from the whole audience.The movie is family-friendly except for fantasy violence, two moments of direct violence, partial nudity (a character is shown in public on television, but is thankfully censored), and less worrying details seen here. See it in 3D, see it in 2D, either works. 3D doesn't stand out, for better or worse. All in all, Thor: The Dark World is worth seeing in cinemas.P.S. Stay after all the credits roll, and you'll be doubly rewarded.I was given early access to see the film by Walt Disney Studious.

I thought it the strongest in the Marvel Universe series after Avengers and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Yes, better than Iron Man (all of them).Casting is solid, with a great bad guy, the storyline is appropriately over the top, without too much attention to character development, and the whole feel of the move is that of an epic myth, in a comic context. Those are traits of many comics, and not necessarily bad ones.Maybe it's my interest in Nordic mythology which gives Thor the edge, or the astonishingly great, epic scenes in the movie.

I do enjoy the suburb acting by Tom Hiddleston, and watching Loki con everybody to his will is very fun. Plot was interesting, but they didn't play enough on the power of the the being. I also didn't like the fact the Earth depended on a psycho scientist, a smart scientist, and two dim interns.

487,taggard-98527,The first real disappointment of the MCU.,4,16 April 2016,"I am going to skip my usual format and just have an open dialog about this film. I found it incredibly hard to come up with any ""The good""s let alone some ""The great""s. Simply put, I think this is the first MCU film that I don't like at all.If you read my review for Thor (2011), you will know that I really loved that film. I loved the cast, the humor (in particular the physical comedy), the redemption story, the introduction of Hawkeye, pretty much everything about it. The Dark World trashes everything that was great about the first movie, and I don't even know why.To start, the comedy of the first movie is almost entirely around Thor and how he doesn't understand the world he has been thrust into without his powers. He is hit by cars and subdued by orderlies. He smashes cups and drinks his new found friends under the table. His ego is the joke and we laugh and smile along with him as he finds his feet (and his place) in a new world. In TDW, the jokes are much meaner and, to me at least, far less funny.One of the principal sources of supposed humor in TDW is Dr. Erik Selvig's mental breakdown. We see an absolute shell of the brilliant scientist we saw in Thor. He runs around naked, gives lectures to a group of disinterested mental patients, and takes off his trousers to think. This is funny how? His mind was almost destroyed by being forced to create a device that killed thousands and practically caused the downfall of his own planet. Har Har.Another source of ""humor"" is Darcy's Intern...cause picking on/abusing people is funny.Unfortunately, the fantastic ensemble cast is entirely wasted. Sif is turned into some sort of love rival and the Warriors Three are turned into mindless, characterless drones who do what Thor tells them, no matter how dumb. Darcy is a joke, a caricature of her character in Thor, and the chemistry between Thor and Jane is as flat as ever.There are so many other problems with this movie. The plot doesn't make sense and relies on so many outrageous coincidences. Death happens too easily and with little real emotional impact. Unnecessary twists happen for no reason. It treats the viewer with such little respect, I could go on for pages.In summary, did not like, won't watch again anytime soon.",Thor - The Dark World

491,jaovitu,Confused,3,5 April 2020,"The sequence of Thor don't have a plot/screenplay, character's development and universe construction. Not even a good director would save.
I prefer to believe that Yorst hindered the work of Markus and McFeely, because they have a well known comic story to adapt and write the screenplay, but they delivered a story without context, development and sense of logic.
The acting was good, but the construction of the characters over the movie didn't make it possible to understand what was the meaning of that acting. With reservation for the performance of Tom Hiddleston, Rene Russo and Anthony Hopkins that could get up a little bit of political critique, Marvel-standard and strength to the movie.
Alan Taylor is capable of conduct a plot and make some good material of it (as we could see in GoT over the years). So, we can not point fingers if the movie is a failed of screenplay or direction, but the cinematographic environment couldn't be created by the constant breaking of sequences and missing/weak spots.
The especial effects are great, and the actions scenes delivery, but you're so confuse when you're watching, that you can't enjoy and be involved with these characteristics.",Thor - The Dark World

The action is relentless. I still don't understand what actually happened - some ancient enemies were defeated but they came back and wielded phenomenal cosmic power and had some awesome space ships and shot lasers at the Norse Gods who fired their lasers back.

494,AlexandraBello,"Well, I'm a fan now!",8,8 November 2013,"I don't go for Thor's movies because I was not the biggest fan for comic books. I was more into girly stuff. However this movie kept me interested the whole time!Although the movie starts with an epic fight, I consider The first part of the movie as very humorous and light (lovely thing); then it gets into action mode.A couple of concepts that grabbed my attention:*The convergence between the worlds. *The way they gave Thor's mother the farewell. *The shape of the Dark Elves' ship. *The implosion grenades. *The volatility and texture of the Aether and the beauty of its prison. *Malekith resting chambers. *Algrim/Kurse's fast killing ways. *The masks or helmets used by the enemy's troop. *The world traveling fighting scene. *Malekith's language. How beautiful.Elements that make this movie unique:*Several grisly scenes throughout the movie. *The depth in Loki's character personality. *Gorgeous cinematography, especially in the scene where Thor's mother is sent away, far far away. *The pace of the movie brings the elements together in a sensationalist way to keep the ADD's attentive.Things that surprised me:*Loki's cooperation with Thor and the whole situation. *That Loki was alive after Kurse stabbed him. *Loki was so excited when he was released from his cell, and a bit comical. *Seeing Stan Lee in the mad house or the mental ward. *The ending (where Loki is pretending to be Odin) and the other ending where The Collector shows his ulterior purpose to give cue to the next movie. I just don't know what happens next in the comic books, so for me this was a surprise.LOVED IT: *Darcy making out with that intern (Ian). *Heimdall's performance like always. *Frigga's fighting scene. *Erick Selvig running around naked. *When Thor and Jane F. come into her apt. *The beautiful Asgard world and its gardens. *When Thor believes Loki is dying.Still expecting: *A mini cat fight between Sif and Jane, because Sif was literally throwing herself to Thor. *A visual of the Dark Elves destiny. *Romantic final scene between Thor and Jane, maybe they get to the next level? *Odin's fate since Loki took his place. *Thanos appearance and maybe Death's as well.

495,ronggur-silalahi,"Fun, epic and it fills up the whole room of excitement",7,13 November 2013,"Thor the Dark World is a total revolution from the first movie. The one thing i noticed though, throughout Thor, Avengers and Thor 2, his hair gets longer every time (which i'm not complaining). The movie was full of action, which fulfills the audience as they walk out of the theater. On the other hand, comedy took place in many parts throughout the movie. What is more interesting is that most of the comedy was performed by Loki, who everybody knows as a major Marvel Villain besides Dr. Doom and Thanos. The comedy, in my opinion, was there because the success of the Avengers, which had many comedy scenes in it, made this movie likable. This movie totally fixed the things that miss from the first Thor. There were many scenes where they introduced Thor's ability to performed his power in certain ways that no one had ever seen before. The connection of Thor and the people of Asgard and his family was portrayed really well by their language, joke and style of speech. The music was an epic score. It really defined the story and I still could not get it out of my head. It's not as memorable as Pirates of the Caribbean but it definitely built the excitement watching the movie. Everybody must go see it. It's well thought and the story and action really defined Thor. Go see go see!",Thor - The Dark World

497,millmat,"A worthy, if not slightly weaker installment in the Marvel film franchise.",7,10 April 2014,"""Thor: The Dark World"" is the Marvel film that made me realize the element of the franchise's success. It's the movie's preference to not take themselves too seriously. Sure, there's still good character development and drama, but the movies still know that the premise is nothing that serious, and manages to have fun with itself, and in the process, lets the audience get in on that fun too. They are as much fun too laugh at as they are to be entertained. Despite not reading any of the comics, I liked the first ""Thor"" movie, so I looked forward to seeing this one. This movie takes place in London (a decision I find pointless, but that's just me). Jane Foster, while awaiting the return of Thor, discovers that she's possessed by a mystical element known as the ether. Because of this, a group of dark elves from the titular dark world, are sent out to kidnap Jane and use the ether's power to rule the world. Now it's up to Thor to stop the elves, all the while trying to decide what to do about his brother, Loki. Something I find that the film does a very good job at is telling a three-act story. The first third of the movie reintroduces as to all of our favorite characters, and the dilemmas that they're all facing. None of it is boring, and I was content in seeing where it would be going. Unfortunately, the second act doesn't shine as much. After Thor saves Jane, he takes her back to his home world, Asgard. Here, we take in the lavish art direction by John Bush, almost reminding me of the ""Ave Maria"" sequence from Fantasia. And yet, I still feel bored. This goes on for awhile. It finally starts to pick itself up during a well paced fight scene between the asgardians and the dark elves, and, without giving too much away, someone dies. One of the other characters had previously built up drama between them, leading to some actual drama. And finally, the final act gives us practically what we want. A great final battle, well paced action, and plenty of brushed on humor. ""Thor:The Dark World"" is a worthy, if not weaker, edition of the Marvel film franchise. The plot is very engaging, the comic relief for the most part is very funny, and as always, the action scenes are some of the best I've ever seen. It's proof that the movies still like to have fun with their premise, like any good action movie should.",Thor - The Dark World
498,jmiew,Best of the 3.,8,14 July 2020,"I'm rather surprised that this is deemed by many as the worst of the 3 Thor films when In my view is the best by a long way.

499,mykedee,What was that?,4,17 November 2013,"Terrible movie. As bad as the first entry and this is hopefully the last. Convoluted, blurred, and without meaning, this was a mess from start to finish. I give it 4 stars for some humor, and the fact that I own several 60's Thor comic books and hope the attention increases the worth of my collection. BAD! I fell asleep early on, went to get popcorn and soda to wake up; after another 30 min found myself dozing again. This is amazing considering it was cold and very loud in the theater. Forgive me, I like story development, and characters to root for, or root against. There is nothing worthy here. This was made because the previous entry made money, so why not chase the cheddar shall we?! Hollywood and their overuse of CGI is increasingly bad and overdone. The characters hop around, as they do in Man of Steel another bad flick. They move really fast and do things we could never imagine characters doing 30 years ago on screen. Well so what?! It looks sooo fake and the result is an unimportant, needless and ridiculously boring movie. AVOID! ps, get a look at the elves as they run in their costumes (big laughs), they actually look like they are in costume! Enough already!",Thor - The Dark World
500,sheance114,"In the tone of disappointment, it's like nothing happened",5,24 March 2014,"Thor: The Dark World is a sequel of the Thor movie in 2011, also a follow-up to the cross-over film: The Avengers, and an eight installment in Marvel's Cinematic Universe. Starring Chris Hemsworth (Rush) as Thor, Natalie Portman (Black Swan) as Thor's love interest, Jane Foster, Tom Hiddleston (Midnight in Paris) as the vengeful Loki, Anthony Hopkins as Thor's father, Odin, Christopher Ecclesston as Malekith and Rene Russo as Thor and Loki's mother Frigga. The film was set to release November 8, 2013, yet ahead in the Philippines which was on October 30th.I truly am a GAGA fan of the cinematic universe. How I begged for something like this; films that are interconnected with each other and one day will cross-over in one epic movie and proceed. Marvel Cinematic Universe is the answer to this plea.They have created oneness and interrelated concepts in comic characters like Iron Man (which truly was the best of all franchises), Captain America, Hulk and Thor. They also even managed to expand the world in television and created a spin-off story about the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. which disappoints fans a bit, but not me.I remembered not liking the first Thor movie due to its long precedence of build-up and little non-satisfying action scenes. And it doesn't differ in Thor: The Dark World.The movie started off with an explanation of Malekith's treason to the Universe with Anthony Hopkins lame voice over. I wasn't INTO IT because there was no intensity in the actor's voice; he was just like a bored story teller and it should've been created with impact since it's the opener of the movie, and it's just infuriating hearing Hopkins lazy on that build-up.And the build-up continues on and on in about an hour out of 112 minutes of the film which bored me to death, not even Frigga's death created much impact.There was a part where Malekith and his gang had already infiltrated Asgard which I also didn't feel the threat due to the fact that there was no build-up on how Malekith would intensify his revenge.The interesting part only exaggerated when (SPOILER, MAJOR SPOILER) Loki died and he battle between Thor and Malekith who acquired the Aether (A dark force in liquid form to extinguish the 9 realms and create darkness) from Jane who had possessed the said element.Yet still the action scenes feel heavy.Although, there were truly funny moments in the film that delights me, since everyone should know that any Marvel Cinematic Universe film would not be possible with no touch of comedy in it. I remember laughing my ass out loud when Loki transformed himself to Captain America that made Chris Evans' uncredited cameo. The comedy lasted throughout the climatic ending, which wasn't even present in the build-up part that lames it all up; not even the amazingly funny Kat Dennings' made an strong laughable moments in the build-up parts (but not in the climax where she and her intern was really funny).So everything sums up to the climax part and the rest of the film was a blah.Thor gave me the impression that there are ups and downs in any cinematic world, and Thor was a down. The action scenes were 'bad' heavy; the build-up was too much that gives a bore; the climatic part wasn't that satisfying; there were no 'HELL YEAH, THAT'S THOR' moment; and there was really nothing to say about the film but disappointment and nothing happened.Thor: The Dark World is directed by Alan Taylor.",Thor - The Dark World
501,JulianTheIronManMintz,Yet another awesome Marvel sequel,8,14 February 2015,"Thor the Dark World in my opinion is another fantastic Marvel studios film, and like Iron Man 3 it doesn't deserve hate or bashing. Yes, to some it may feel like another filler movie u until 'Age of Ultron"", that doesn't move the story of this shared universe any further at all, is a waste of time with a lackluster villain and mediocre plot. I respectively disagree to all but one of those points: the villain in this one was honestly pretty weak. He had very little motivation, little to no relate ability and was pretty wasted. That being said, its forgivable due to these points as to why the movie rocks--It's better than its predecessor: This is no knock on the first film. We loved it and the unsurprisingly Shakespearean feel of director Kenneth Branagh's introduction of the character. They've raised the stakes and was an all around better movie than the first, something that had yet to be done in a MCU sequel that wasn't The Avengers.-It's surprising: And those surprises don't feel cheap. Thor: The Dark World is unpredictable, and we guarantee that at least something will catch everyone off guard, especially THE surprise.-It's again filled with genuine humor: The film is packed full of jokes, and while some of them don't work (it's probably packed too full), the ones that do really do. It certainly isn't quite as funny as The Avengers, but then again it wasn't written by Joss Whedon. It's probably the second funniest in the MCU.-It utilizes its supporting characters: Everybody this time around has something to do. Granted, with the number of characters in the movie many of them don't have something to do for long, but it's very impressive how important so many characters ended up being. Even Frigga (wife of Oden) gets in on the action, and we can't help but be happy that Heimdall has a bit more screen time than expected. It touches our Idris Elba loving hearts.-It's full of action: This is no surprise given that Game of Thrones director Alan Taylor was brought in for the Thor sequel, but the action in this installment is more gritty and ""realistic."" The multi-realm final battle sequence was really cool, and it sure beats the finale from Thor.And for those 5 simple reasons, including the amazing casting, performances, chemistry between characters, effects and of course the Stan lee cameo are why Marvel still hasn't had a bad movie yet.",Thor - The Dark World
502,Jackal75,It's dark alright but not in a good way.,5,11 March 2015,"The rating on IMDb is misleading. The movie is average 5/10 at best. The plot of the movie is that Thor must fight the dark elves who use ether as some sort of weapon. The acting is okay. Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins were competent in their roles. The standout was Tom Hiddleston who played Loki. Kat Dennings of Two Broke Girls fame plays the intern is there for the comic relief. However as other users have mentioned, the humour is not funny but rather irritating. She too has an intern and he comes off as an idiot and not in a funny way. This movie has some amazing special effects and scenery, however unless the plot is of good standard, special effects can only carry it so far. The action scenes with Thor are bloodless thanks to a pg13 rating and are not that great. This movie is worth a hire or wait for it to come on free to air TV.Jackal75",Thor - The Dark World

Yeah...I see these things in the movie but I don't see how they're hurting it, and when it's explained, I understand it, but I just don't see what everyone else is seeing. I enjoyed the movie and literally the only thing I didn't like was how underused Christopher Eccleston was, and he was criminally underused. I think people complaining that his character wasn't developed are spot on about that. Otherwise, this is in my top five for favorite Disney Marvel movies.",Thor - The Dark World
504,Filmazer,"Not spectacular, but still a noteworthy...",6,31 October 2013,"...addition to ""The Avengers"" canon of films.I recommend this movie if you are any of the below:1) You are a completist and would feel wrong to have missed an installment belonging to the Avengers series of films despite speculating that it is a filler movie made only to grab your money.2)You love to stare at Chris Hemsworth's bulging biceps.3) You love superhero movies, even if its plot is pretty standard with few or no surprises.4) You are single male and have nothing better to do.My gripes with the film may be more of a problem with Hollywood movie-making these days than with the film itself. Production feels uninspired and run of the mill. The plot, props, action, effects and gags are all neatly in place to generate just enough wonder and excitement for the average viewers so they don't fall asleep.During the movie, we are told that there are nine realms, but each one is nothing more than a snow globe when compared to the diversity of Earth. Apparently, in all the other realms, people can travel between dimensions but still fight with swords and axes. Whereas on Earth, we have all manner of weaponry but knows sh*t about the universe save a few super geniuses who like running around strip naked and whatnot.So there you have it.If none of what I've just said sounds like a major turn-off, I will say that this is good entertainment equivalent to regarding an extra value meal at Macdonald's being a good meal sometimes. Otherwise, please do yourself a favor and steer clear of the movie to save yourself from having to cry about it later on the boards.",Thor - The Dark World
505,samuelrichards-84599,Pretty mediocre and bland sequel,3,4 February 2021,"Thor dark world is mostly just boring and lame the main character Thor isn't all that interesting compared to other mcu protagonists but Chris Hemsworth did a great job as him. The other human range from meh to decent, a lot of the fight scenes are pretty lazy and don't look very good the main antagonist is extremely boring he has no motivation and isn't at all threatening and the actor didn't do well as him. Also not to mention how little screen time he gets, but Loki is by far the best character in this movie a lot of the funny jokes/scenes come from him and the relationship between him and his mother is great. Pretty much every decent scene in the movie involves Loki, and the cgi is significantly better than the Thor 1 but it's nothing to special some of the character designs and worlds look pretty good the antagonists army the dark elves look nice and there's interesting ideas like black hole grenades and this movie is quite significant to the mcu which is both a good thing and a bad thing the ending is quite good and directly leads into thor ragnarok though, but overall not that good",Thor - The Dark World
506,alexandresobreira-12-509311,Quite the disappointment,2,11 November 2013,"Thor the Dark World was quite the disappointment. Sure, it was fun to watch, but that was all, and the clichés were quite annoying. Frigga's death was perhaps the most glaring of them. And she dies for the only reason (if you can call that a reason) that they need Odin to loose control and prepare to go after Malekith like an enraged bull (which he never seems to get around to do, leaving everything to Thor once he and Loki get to leave Asgard. Also, Asgard's defenses and army were pathetic. Being caught unawares makes no sense, as Bor was supposed to know that Malekith was alive, and thus so should Odin. And even caught at unawares would not provide for such a ridiculously easy victory by the Dark Elves over Asgardian forces and such a horribly silly idea that Frigga could take care of herself (I mean, seriously, what is the good of having an army in the palace if they can't even guard the queen?). And all that so Thor could be shown as the only one that could fight the Dark Elves. And Odin only gets to kill one with Gungnir!! Of course the cliffhanger at the end was just silly. I believe we are to assume that Loki was disguised as the guard that came to announce the arrival of his ""corpse"" to Odin (considering the sidelong look the guard gave Odin), and thus managed to overpower him somehow (which should be very difficult indeed, but, hey, the movie is way less coherent than the comics, so...). Another thing that annoys me (that was somewhat present in the first movie, but not to this extent) is Odin's and Thor's insistence that Asgardians are not gods. They are! They are the Norse gods. Seriously, I can only think they were afraid of offending the sensibilities of Christians watching the movie, but, come one! Odin is called the All- Father because the is supposed to have created the Nine Worlds. And so on and so forth. Just boring. Ah, by the way, if Asgardians are mortal and not gods at all, why does Odin refer to Jane as ""mortal""? He should have used a term like ""short-lived"" or something like that. Of course the magical day-saving device Erik and Jane put together is not a problem: Marvel does that all the time, like when Dr. Doom manages to create a device that steals the powers of the Beyonder, a being so powerful and alien he should be beyond the understanding of any human without centuries of studies and scientific progress. But Doom, like Reed Richards, is supposed to be a genius, which apparently means, in comic book parlance, he is wiser, more knowledgeable and more intelligent than anyone (except Reed Richards, of course. :) As a final comment, no, the film did not have the promised wider scope: the 9 reals are barely shown, Hogun's village is just as bad as any cheap Conan-like under financed TV production, Svartalfheim is just a desert filmed through darkened lenses, we just get to see enough of Asgard to, as I said, see how badly organized they are, and then we come back to Earth... again! My perfect Thor film would be if they compressed the old Colonizers of Rigel Saga into a movie. No saving the Universe (which is also a boring cliché, like, Thor will only show up on the big screen when he is saving the world), but just fighting an alien race waaaay away from Earth.",Thor - The Dark World

508,Al1899,Thor: The Dark World,10,2 December 2013,"Marvel sure know how to up their game. This sequel is one such example. I wasn't familiar with Thor but after viewing the first film, I decided to view the second, after a university class, and I really enjoyed the film. The Marvel Cinematic Universe just keeps getting better with every film and I cannot wait for more! Best parts...* Chris Evans cameo - This was a surprising cameo as Tom Hiddleston was acting just like Chris Evans and I mean speaking exactly like Chris Evans!. Everyone in the cinema enjoyed this cameo and they, along with me, were clapping for this magnificent scene.* Filmed in London. - It was a great decision to film in London as the previous films were more or less situated in America. Different locations are good and I like diversity.* The music played during the funeral of Frigga was a standout for me as it was emotional as everyone in the realm of Asgard were sad to see the demise of a much loved Queen and mentor. It was such a beautiful scene and the music gets to you as it was perfect. * I felt really sorry for Loki when he was told by an Asgardian guard about the demise of Queen Frigga. Despite everything that happened in the first Thor film and Avengers, he really loved his foster mum and it was shown when he got up and released his rage by blasting everything in the prison with his fists clenched. * Sir Anthony Hopkins once again shows that he was the right actor chosen to portray Odin. Sentencing Loki with authority at the beginning of the film and exiling Thor in the first film were defining moments by an actor I truly admire.* Bringing Kat Dennings back as Darcy was a master stroke as her timely comedy lines and actions balanced the action scenes as well as the heart-wrenching scenes such as the death of Frigga and the apparent demise of Loki. I love the witty personality of Kat Dennings. * Natalie Portman...What can I say?! I absolutely love everything about her life!!! She has such a bubbly personality and is definitely cute. As for her performance in Thor 2, I loved it! I hope she will be in third film and have a part in Avengers 2. If Thor and Jane Foster go their separate ways in Avengers 2, I will never forgive Marvel for this action as I truly admire and love Natalie Portman.Overall, I enjoyed the film and I rate the film 10/10. Performances by everyone were phenomenal. I can't wait for Captain America: The Winter Soldier.",Thor - The Dark World
509,smvouriot,Incredibly generic apart from an inspired final act,4,27 December 2014,"'Thor: The Dark World' basically plays out exactly as one would expect from a Marvel Universe movie. There are many wisecracks, fights, explosions and post credit scenes. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's just that a good 75 – 80% of the film gives off an aura of 'been there, done that'. Of all the Marvel Universe films that have been released thus far, beginning with the fantastic 'Ironman' in 2008 and most recently at the time of writing with the average 'Guardians of the Galaxy' in 2014, this second film starring the God of Thunder would rank close to the bottom, but although since all but one Marvel Universe film is 'OK' at the least, that's still saying that even the lesser films of this saga are only just entertaining and nothing more.Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston give the only performances of note as the two main characters, with Hemsworth again owning the role and Hiddleston showing Loki's sneaky and cunning side with amusing results (A scene where Loki transforms into different characters, including a certain Captain, is one of the few genuinely imaginative and entertaining parts of the film.) The only problem I have with Loki is that, during the first half especially, he just isn't in the movie enough. For roughly half the running time, Loki is reduced to sitting in a prison cell by himself, which isn't high on the list of the many things I want to watch Loki do. Apart from these two, none of the other actors are particularly memorable, which is a shame since there are great actors like Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins in the film as well. No one in the film gives a bad performance, it's just that the performances are only serviceable and nothing more. For example, take the villain, Malekith played by Christopher Eccleston. Malekith growls and snarls in both English and Dark Elfish in a deep menacing voice, complete with threatening villain features and a plan to destroy the universe (I wonder though, what a boring life that must be if your plan to destroy the universe actually succeeds). Malekith is the definition of a bland, stereotypical villain in an Action/Adventure/Fantasy/Sci-Fi film. He does nothing interesting, his plans are conventional, he possesses no individual or memorable characteristics, his lines are never witty and even his physical appearance is bland and generic. This is a shame since he is played by Christopher Eccleston, an actor I like very much and whom I know can pull off memorable villains. This then begs the question, why hire a good actor like Eccleston only to alter his voice, have him speak gibberish and obscure him in makeup so that he is close to unrecognizable? You might as well hire some random guy off the street of roughly the same height/build to play the character if there's that much makeup and alterations rather than hire a professional. Lots of money could be saved and hardly anyone would notice.The whole film, except for the inspired finale, has a run-of-the-mill feel to it. Other aspects, such as the direction, cinematography, production design and score feel bland and workmanlike. The composer of the film is Brian Tyler, whose work I usually enjoy very much, but he phones it in here, offering standard order action movie music. Usually I find Tyler's work has a distinct personal stamp to it, with him being especially good at subtly emotional cues in the midst of action movies (For example, his work on 'Eagle Eye', 'Battle: Los Angeles' and even 'Thor: The Dark World's cousin, 'Ironman 3') but none of that was evident here. Alan Taylor directs most of the film with no personal style or flair (Much unlike Kenneth Branagh from the first 'Thor' film) until the truly inspired and entertaining finale which is a nice break from watching cities getting obliterated by otherworldly beings in action films nowadays. I won't spoil but I will say that this is where the film truly becomes entertaining and I only wish that the preceding 80 minutes or so had been as fun and creative as the final act. Let's just hope that director Alan Taylor's next film, 'Terminator: Genisys', is more in the vein of the final 20 minutes of 'Thor: The Dark World' and not the other 80 minutes of boring, generic action and exposition.Finally, one problem I have with not just this film, but the entire Marvel Universe, is that in each new standalone adventure, the stakes are always low, which doesn't exactly make for edge-of-your-seat viewing. Because whatever happens to Thor, Ironman, Captain America or anybody major, you know they'll survive because A: The film will extensively tease what's to come, B: The next film will most likely already be in production, C: Even if a character does die then they usually find a way to revive and D: Marvel has already planned out their films until at least the end of the decade. Combine the knowledge of all these factors while watching a Marvel film such as this one and the result is incredibly uninvolving. There may be lots of action, but it is rarely exciting, since you know that these characters will defeat the enemy and be all ready for the next adventure. In the end, 'Thor: The Dark World' feels less like a movie and more like a product, only here as filler to advertise and build up to what's to come, while unfortunately forgetting to create a unique identity or personality all its own.",Thor - The Dark World
510,tonybaiden,Behold the might of Thor! - Spoilers,9,25 November 2013,"What can I say? This film was truly epic. A must watch with phenomenal action sequences and hilarious humour. Positives: 1) Great acting, especially from Tom Hiddleston as Loki, most probably the third best cinematic incarnation of a comic book character, behind Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark/Iron Man and Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. 2) Just like The Avengers and Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World consisted of great humour. 3) CGI. The immense detail used for Asgard, Svartalfheim and so many more locations and objects were incredible! 4) The opening. An awesome flashback of Bor and the Asgardians against Malekith and the Dark Elves. It showed quite a direct narrative in what was happening at the beginning. 5) The ending was exactly what true believers would want. Who would want Loki to die (apart from Erik Selvig and Agent Coulson)? No-one. His apparent death was emotionally meaningful, well to Thor anyway. Before Thor left Asgard to return to Earth, he was telling Odin about Loki's sacrifice and said ""Thank You"". After Thor left, the image of Odin was actually an illusion! Loki lives saying most probably the best line at the end of a movie where Loki says ""No brother, thank you."" 6) Cameos. Stan Lee is back! Excelsior! Te legend of comics, the cameo king, he's back! It was hilarious seeing him back on the big screen as he wasn't in The Wolverine or Iron Man 3, well, he was, only in a deleted scene though. But Stan didn't have the best cameo. Everyone thought we'd see Cap again in Winter Soldier, but no. After freeing Loki from prison, Thor and Loki were headed towards a Dark Elf ship, Loki made Thor look like Sif, then, Loki, unexpectedly made himself look like Captain America! Stars and stripes all the way! 7) Frigga kicking some butt. Maybe the funniest and most shocking fight in the film, Frigga almost defeated Malekith with just two knives! Unfortunately for Thor and Loki and Odin and the Asgardians, Frigga met a tragic end. 8) Thor and Mjolnir. Thor and his hammer are ultra epic. You could see Thor jump off a cliff, flip over, catch Mjolnir and fly! Awesome.Negatives: 1) Malekith. He wasn't a big problem, but he was kind of a one dimensional villain. All he practically wanted was the Aether, a deadly source which inserted itself into Jane Foster. Couldn't Malekith been nice and asked politely for the Aether? Maybe that would've been a bit boring. 2) The intern's intern. That's correct. Jane Foster's intern, annoying Darcy Lewis hired an even more annoying intern who just stood around watching the world erupt into chaos and whacking a dark elf with a car. They could have either got rid of him, or put him to good use. 3) The post-credits scenes. I am super hyped up for Guardian's of the Galaxy and the first of the two post-credits scenes introduced to one of the Guardian's main antagonists. The Collector. He did actually look kind of cheesy with his lamb skin coat and purple minions. Seeing Thanos at the end of the Avengers was amazing. Probably the best post-credits scene ever, especially as the Avengers is my favourite film of all time. Seeing The Collector receive the Aether, an infinity stone, didn't feel right for me. I absolutely love Marvel and Infinity is an epic storyline, so couldn't we see Thanos get the Aether? If they were going the Guardians of the Galaxy way, why couldn't we see Rocket Raccoon or Groot pop up? Post-credits seen 2 was worse. It was 45 seconds and 37 seconds of it was spent with a Thor and Jane having the cheesiest kiss ever and then randomly, a monster pops up in London! I was hoping for an Age of Ultron post-credits scene, but hay, we might see that in Winter Soldier or Guardians.Conclusion: Thor: The Dark World was an awesome film, the third best in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, behind Iron Man 1 and The Avengers. Full of laughs and an overall thrilling action-packed epic. Better than the original with great direction by Alan Taylor. 9/10.",Thor - The Dark World
511,jonathanelmaleh556,It truly is something else,9,10 November 2013,"I really loved the first Thor movie, but my 1 complaint with it was that we didn't get enough Thor, now in this movie Thor was just a complete bad ass for the entire movie, the plot moved fairly fast and was interesting, i found the best scene to be when Thor, Loki and Jane go to Malikith to give him his darkness thing (i forgot what it is called) and Loki made a illusion as if he had turned on Thor by cutting off his hand and pretending to help the elves, but in the end he was still on team Asgard but it cost him his life (but in the end of the film it was revealed that he faked his death so that he could pretend to be Odin because Thor didn't want to be king so in the end Loki would be king, even in a different body), now for my 2 problems with the movie, 1) I felt that malikith was not a threat to Thor in anyway so if he would even try to go face to face with Thor, he wouldn't even stand a chance, now the second problem isn't as big of one, the movie was very funny and they made a lot of jokes, now in the end of the movie they had a big intense scene that primarily took place in London but they still were making jokes and I wish that they could have just taken it a little bit more seriously but still it worked most of the time.",Thor - The Dark World
512,tb7682,Very well done,9,11 November 2013,"I have never been into superhero movies like this and would have never imagined that I would enjoy them. My husband wanted to see this movie so we went to the first opening on Thursday night. I have to say that I loved it. I didn't expect to and I was trying not to. The one thing that I found to be the most interesting is the dynamic between Thor and Loki. I loved the complicated brother relationship aspect. I think that Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman were good in this movie but the best was Tom Hiddleston. I don't believe that I have seen a movie with him in it. But he was truly the most interesting and believable character. He was the reason I wanted to continue to watching the movie. I kept wondering if he'd betray Thor or if he'd be an honest brother to him. All I have to say is that the ending is the best. It'll make you think ""I really didn't see that coming."" Well, some people might see it coming; however, if you are completely unaware of comic book stuff like me, you will be surprised. Anyways, I was surprised I liked it and Loki stole the show.",Thor - The Dark World
513,fachrial-ilham,An upgrade,6,12 November 2013,"Ever since I watched the first Thor movie, I had this feeling that this superhero will not evolve into a great movie. Because frankly, Thor 1 sucked. This sequel proves me, well, almost wrong. There are three things this movie improved: 1. plot 2. visual effect 3. character developmentFor the first point, I think Marvel - ever since the Avengers - has been working a lot on a serious and full of twists plot. This movie tried to do that but I think they could do a little better. There are a lot of ends that they could expand, such as: when Jane was in possession of the Aether, she had visions and strange things happening to her body that Thor thought he had to bring her in to Asgard to cure. But instead of curing and before anything big enough for the story could happen to her, Malekith sucks the Aether out of her. The story could elaborate on how Thor tries to save her instead of letting her roam lazily doing nothing in Asgard. Or is it an attempt to clash Jane with Sif who also has feelings for Thor? If it were then I don't think this movie gives you enough of that. Or is it the prelude to Thor 3 which would open up more on Jane and Asgard? This one we shall wait and see.Visual effect: average. I don't see anything new in this movie that I haven't seen before in any other movie. Nothing I could elaborate. Harry Potter movies have better ideas on this one. As for character development, this movie is moving so fast that the characters had no chance to introduce and tell us if they have something more than we see in the screen. Loki has a riff of emotion in this story but that too felt too quick and premature. Even the ending is weird for me.All in all, a good movie but it could use a little more improvement.",Thor - The Dark World
514,john_carlton02,What in the hell am I watching?,4,5 December 2013,"The Dark Elves have blasters and space ships? Asgard is ringed by anti-aircraft guns?what?Marvel jumped the shark on this one. Oh & the story is uninteresting, uninspired, and lame. I used to be a big fan of Natalie Portman, but she's just crapping thru another role that could have gone to any actress.the only bright spot is Kat Denning. she makes a better Jane Foster & can at least emote. Natalie apparently left all her acting talent on Leon The Professional.try harder Marvel to make a good movie. This one stinks.wait until this POS is on free TV & refuse to spend money on crummy movies.",Thor - The Dark World
515,cobyscomics,Thor: The Dark World,9,26 January 2014,"I think I had the perfect viewing experience. Wednesday I watched the first Thor movie; then Thursday afternoon I watched the Avengers, before going to see The Dark World Thursday night. I've also been playing the ""Avengers Assemble"" Facebook game, which prepared me brilliantly for the movie. It's one of the great joys of the transmedia empire that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In the Facebook game, the newest Spec Ops mission has Kurse, Dark Elves, and several other elements from the movie. I'm not too familiar with this part of Thor's canon, but being even slightly introduced to these parts of the story via this game made the movie that much more enjoyable.It's hard to put into words just how much I enjoyed Thor: The Dark World. It was everything a Thor movie should be, and then some. In the first movie, I found myself wishing for more time exploring the Nine Worlds. I also found it hard to care about Asgard and wishing for more time on Earth. This time, not only did I get to see Thor and his Asgardians wrapping up their campaign to establish peace throughout the Nine Worlds, but I also got to see a brilliant before-the-dawn-of-time story. The story made me care about Asgard even more than Midgard (Earth), to the point where, not only did the setting not matter, but I found the scale tilted the other way, where I wanted more Asgard than Earth. Although, Jane Foster and her Phoenix-esque possession by the Aether provided the link for me (as for Thor) back to Earth, and I found myself loving the story that much more.It was the most fun I've had at the movies since the Avengers. Everything about it was done masterfully, and I can't wait to watch it again! Not only did they do everything I wished they had done in the first Thor movie, and do it better than I ever imagined they would, they also took some of my favorite elements from other movies and perfected them.Ever since seeing the kids mess with the malfunctioning matrix in Beyond, a short film, part of the Animatrix from 10 years ago, I've been subconsciously wanting to see this squishy gravity concept played out better on the big screen. I got this wish fulfilled in The Dark World. Watching the kids, Jane, Darcy, and Ian throw stuff into the weird anti-gravitational field in the abandoned warehouse was super neat-o. Then, when Thor and Malekith were fighting and warping and teleporting between worlds, with ""Mew-Mew"" (Mjolnir) frantically trying to find its way across the galaxies and back to its master's hand, I was blown away. This fight couldn't have been better! Ian slamming the car down on the Elves was just icing.With the Man of Steel a few months ago, a bit of my yearning for the epic super-powered battle that Dragon Ball Z perfected was satiated. But Thor versus Malekith took epic fights to a whole nother level! The timing of The Dark World's release couldn't have been better, with Man of Steel coming to Blu-Ray this Tuesday. There is no competition! Seeing Thor flying through the air like that with his electrified hammer, as he came crashing down into Malekith to teleport him away, I actually believed he was the god of thunder. I dare say I've never seen a better epic battle.I also loved how they continued to play with Arthur C. Clarke's notion that ""magic is just science that we don't understand yet"". Jane's back and forth with the healers about the ""quantum field generator"" versus ""soul forge"" was just one little example of this. The forcefields both in the prisons and over the capitol were another. It was especially amusing watching Thor and Loki try to figure out how to make Malekith's ship work. There were many other wonderful parts of maybe science-fiction / maybe magic that made the movie just that much better.During the part when Thor and Loki are escaping from Asgard, I couldn't help but think back to some of the now-lame space battles from Star Wars and how much better this was than that! Even some of the sound effects were the same. I know it's difficult to say anything is better than Star Wars, but, I have to admit, Malekith's fleet was cooler than any of the ships from the former.So many other good parts to this movie. Too much for my feable mind to have remembered after only one viewing. Thor: The Dark World was such a fun, fantastical, beautiful, amazing movie. I can't wait to watch it again!",Thor - The Dark World
516,Kubrick2002,"better than the first great acting, locations, and what?!?",7,27 April 2015,so in Thor the dark world the dark elves lead by malekith want to take over the 9 realms with an infinity stone known as the ether. the location on earth primarily england provides a different view on the world and that the world knows about Thor and most likely the other avengers. tom hiddleston and Chris hemesworth do a awesome job as brother-brother. Loki's mind tricks are also seen a lot more. hemdal is just amazing taking down that INVISIBLE plane. Odin is helpful in explaining what are the infinity stones and who are the dark elves. but hold on a second what happened to Odin. Loki's now on the thrown of Asgard and lucky for him hemdal hasn't alerted Thor who is now living on earth with Jane. the collector also makes a post credit appearance and so does Adam warlock in his cocoon. the collector wants the infinity stones so that thanos wont destroy the universe and all the interesting life. it confused me until i saw it the second time and saw how great this movie is.,Thor - The Dark World
517,SanForZeke,Better than Thor 1...,5,4 April 2014,"...which doesn't say much. For all it's impressive visuals (and it had a few), it's still the characters and story I'm hoping to appreciate. A stunning environment means nothing if the characters are as likable as yesterday's garbage. So... I'll go into the characters since the story is too easy to go through.Malekith - sorely underused, in lots of ways. I hoped for a menacing Dark Elf that would intimidate our dear Asgardians, and really push them towards the wall. Instead, he came off as a semi-tired Dark Lord who really, really wanted his shiny toy that would enable him to wipe out everything into darkness unless of course, someone just happens to be able to stop him. Kurse was far more intimidating than him.Thor - If he is supposed to play the ""royal"" prince of Asgard, and no emotions whatsoever otherwise (unless Loki makes him angry), then he did a good job. He's a protector, nothing more, nothing less, again, unless Loki riles him up - shame he went down to Earth.Jane & her mortal sidekicks - Good God. Even Selvig wasn't worth watching in this movie. All of them really was just there, stealing screen time. Romantic interest Jane is insufferable, she still haven't developed a character beyond pining for Thor - is this the reason miss Portman is bored with her role (not very challenging) or does she just doesn't care?. Just get rid of them, already. I swear, if that blasted ""romance"" survives in Thor 3, then I'm done.Odin - Oh, he was in the movie? Yes, now I remember him.. he waved a spear and killed a Dark Elf, told Loki off and argued with Thor.Loki - Someone who actually seemed to enjoy his role. Can't say I blame him, when you gets to be the guy that likes to push the buttons of everyone else. It doesn't bode well when the semi-villain is the most (if not only) interesting character in the movie, but since he was around, I could watch from start to finish. He had the mockery, the anger, and the illusions to make it interesting. And well, besides the fact that he actually bothered to breathe a little ""life"" into his character.What else is there to say... Frigga and Sif, as little as we got from them, was good enough. Credit to Frigga for being a kick-ass character and to Sif for sticking to business. The Warriors three was underused, the Dark Elves (sans Kurse) were boring, and I could care less about everyone from the Earth who filled no purpose but to to offer a timely solution to all the problems or talk about Jane's romance with Thor. Loved the Captain America cameo.But still, better than Thor 1. Thanks Loki.",Thor - The Dark World
518,shifeili,What???,1,1 February 2014,"I don't know how some of the reviews here are so positive! Bad. bad movie. All the happenings seem so constructed, that I couldn't stop thinking why the figures in the movie act so stupidly. Very bad writing. The scenery can be good from time to time. But the events in the movie just seem like none of the characters could make A SINGLE logic and useful decision. 2 stars because it had some good pictures in it. Otherwise more than horrible movie that made me think ""What? Oh, come on!"" about a hundred times. it almost seems like a spoof of a good vs. bad plot. And on the way we have a bunch of bad jokes to mess up this movie even more.",Thor - The Dark World
519,baqken,About as flat as a lazy Saturday morning cartoon,4,8 November 2013,"I'm not going into details about the movie because at the heart the problem Thor has is pretty simple: It ignores a lot of the motivations of the characters on a thinly laced plot.The first Thor took a while to grow on me, but it still outdoes the second installment. But why is it a better movie than the second installment? It's mostly because the motivations of the characters and villains are clearly laid out and establishes a better impetus with the story. Loki is struggling to find out who he is, Thor is trying to become who he is expected to be, and the frost giants work out the rough edges in the story arc, the same can't be said of The Dark World.You don't have any sort of interesting dynamics between the characters and instead get references to the first movie, or things that worked for the first movie, and try to play them out again. The movie never really picks up any identity for itself and just continues to harp on the events of the Avengers as well as the lead into new films of the franchise being its primary focus which makes the plot really spread thin and boring after a while.For the sake of not repeating myself, concerning the villain that is, I'll leave it at that. Save your money.",Thor - The Dark World

He was complex but with a tinge of madness mixed in and perfectly written for the film. The rationale for what he does and how he behaves is masterful. I truly loved how Loki was written and portrayed. Then again, I honestly can say that about all the main characters. Thor and Jane really are allowed to shine here as well.My main critique after watching the first film was the instance romance between Jane and Thor. After watching this movie, you buy the love at first sight scenario boosted by the situational intrigue. This time around, the pace of the film really worked well. I can't remember a film that grabs you like they do right off the bat and never lets go but does it with intelligence and heart. Hard to argue any editorial cuts at this point whatever they may have been.",Thor - The Dark World

Natalie port man was the main part of the film.All the roles were equally distributed in such a way that no one was seen less and no one was given more importance.So if there is anyone who has been reading this review, i have to say just one thing.Shut down whatever you are using and rush to the nearest theater.

Too many fight scenes/political conflict scenes in ASGARD. I wanted to see more scenes where Thor interacts with earth people (Natalie Portman character).The acting was GOOD.

Really. Bland. The story was remarkably similar to the first, and very predictable. But, in my opinion, the good in this movie outweighs the bad.I should proceed no further without mentioning Loki. He was absolutely incredible in this film. He was just as clever and interesting as he always has been, and we got to see much more brotherly banter between him and Thor this time, which was really awesome.Asgard is absolutely beautiful. We get to see much more of it this time around, and it was extremely aesthetically pleasing. I have seen people say that Jane Foster's sidekicks, Darcy and Ian, were annoying in this film. I in no way found them annoying. They're hilarious! The final fight was really fun as well. Watching Mjolnir try to follow Thor while he tumbles through worlds was hilarious. The humor in this movie is on point. Loki is hilarious, the aforementioned sidekicks are hilarious, Jane's earth ""boyfriend"" added some interesting comic relief, and little moments like Thor hanging Mjolnir on a coat rack were great fun as well.

Let's add this too! After all, we have Princess Amidala in our cast! Oh, wait! I saw this movie the other day, 'Star Trek: Into Darkness' and it was f*ing a-m-a-z-i-n-g! What about having Loki resemble Khan, and we could also borrow from the title too, let's call this sequel 'Dark' something... let me see... Oh, I got it! Dark World!"" I could go on and cite moments that reminded me of John Carter, King Kong, X-Men and so forth...Don't get me wrong, the movie is not bad, but at least to me, it felt too much like a 'montage' from other movies.I liked the first one very much, so maybe my expectations were too high.

He got the balance about right I thought - although possibly a little soft and not berserker enough.3) Loki stood out for me as well played character. Subtle and solid. 4) Humour was well placed and a fun watch.

528,Aleksandar_Amurov,THOR 2 enters my ALL TIME FAVORITE list,10,9 November 2013,"The second installment of the saga of the God of Thunder is rocking awesome!!! I haven't had so much fun in a movie theater since THE LORD OF THE RINGS. It's that good. The Hobbit on the other hand isn't near close. Thor is nothing like the other Marvel movies about super heroes. This one is a totally different animal. It is up there with the big boys-Star Wars, Star Trek and The Lord of The Rings. I could tell that the movie crew spent a good amount of time to make it right. This is not a fast production for easy cash ins. This one is The Real Deal-A True Movie Magic! I was a bit afraid that the second one is not going to match the quality of the first one. I mean how do you top the scene where Thor is being cast out of Asgard by his father Odin. The level of acting delivered by Anthony Hopkins was just awe inspiring! Well, the second one has few of those scenes and it just keeps delivering. How long has it been since I wanted to see a movie over again. Thor and Thor 2-Tthe Dark World are an instant classic and as I love to say: Do yourselves a favor and see those two movies! I recommend regular projection over 3d screening since the film was originally shot in 2d and was meant to be viewed in 2d. It is cheaper too. Actually if you go to a morning projection in any theater you will pay close to nothing. I payed only $6.00! If you don't want to pay that you can always rent it off of the RED BOX kiosks for a dollar and some cents(the movie will take a few months to be available to rent). Always pick the blu-ray over DVD for richer colors, greater resolution, crisp details, supreme audio quality and that cinema feel that is bigger than life.I want you to know that my review is totally independent. I am not paid by any company for my reviews and will never let myself be paid to deliver a review. I am a regular citizen that enjoys watching movies and I stand behind all of my reviews. Please check my List of Movies and if you disagree with this review you are most likely a looser. Just kidding, not.",Thor - The Dark World
529,nico-hvi,... but it sure is entertaining!,6,3 November 2013,"Those words were uttered quite often by myself (also to myself) as I walked home from the theatres after watching Thor: The Dark World. The story makes little to no sense and incorporates all the tropes one would expect: the monster of the week (Dark Elves this time around, the Frost Giants seem to be a distant memory), some enemies become friends and Chris Hemsworth takes of his shirt.However, even though I've never been a fan of 'accepting something for what it is', that is exactly what this movie forces you to do. It doesn't attempt to make any sense, nor does it even slightly attempt to take itself seriously. I think the last time I laughed out loud so much during a movie was watching Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and that says a lot.This movie truly is a stellar example of an action comedy, but could benefit greatly from a slightly more coherent plot. All in all though - well worth the watch.",Thor - The Dark World
530,triskelsey,Not So Epic,7,9 November 2013,"Out of all the heroes, my favorite is Thor simply because I love the dynamic between him and his brother and because its set in Asgard (which is ten times more awesome than Earth). Plus, this movie I was incredibly excited for just for the simple fact that Alan Taylor was directing it, the same director who did the most awesome Game of Thrones episodes.Now, on to the actual review. Was this the best movie I've ever seen? No. It really wasn't, it had some humor but not as much as Iron Man 3, had some good action but not as great as say, Game of Thrones and Jane Foster was more irritating than in the first movie. The start of the movie greatly mirrored the start of the first movie which began to irritate me already, why copy what was already done and not that great? I loved the chemistry between Thor, Sif and the Warrior's Three and was sorely disappointed that they didn't get shown more. Loki's scenes were incredibly interesting though they once again, like in the first film, didn't emphasize on the relationship. They hinted that Loki was close to Frigga, had learned magic from her but it was nothing really detailed.Odin was a dick, extremely so. Jane, as I said, was annoying. Thor was good but he could have gone so much farther. His and Loki's scenes were the best out of the whole movie but they were short and ended so abruptly. I wish that this movie would have gone more into the entire relationship of the royal family, to show the bond and the broken pieces instead of just brushing against it. It bothered me the potential and it just wasn't met. Malekith was just not, that great of a villain. He sort of fell flat and that too irritated me because he had the potential for a cool story.Now don't get me wrong, the movie is fantastic. It really is great, good action, great chemistry, awesome special effects (except at the very end) but there was just the potential formore. So much more. I would have loved it if the Aether had taken over and controlled Jane. Would have loved for a little bit more Thor and Loki, more royal family, more of Sif and the Warrior's Three. Just more. Less elves and Jane, more Asgard. The twist at the end was fantastic but again, I wish that they would have explained like why Loki kept saying sorry when he ""died"". We can all guess but I would like a for sure answer. Did he mean it or not? What happened to Odin? Obviously Sif and the Warrior's Three didn't suffer that bad of a punishment (after credits scene alert) but why? Loki hates them along with Thor (maybe), so why spare them? AND WHY COULDN'T HE KILL JANE? PLEASE GET RID OF HER!The after credits scene was awesome, I couldn't help but squeal at such a strong hint at Guardians of the Galaxy. Ah! So exciting.All in all, good movie just a little disappointing but totally worth seeing especially for the Captain America cameo. Ugh, best part if the whole movie (and it was between Thor and Loki! Imagine that).",Thor - The Dark World
531,matty006,Phenomenal! Better than The Avengers,6,1 November 2013,"This was phenomenal! Better than The Avengers with the expanse of a larger scale, and expanding the Marvel Cinematic Universe to reaches that exemplify the sci-fi feel to it. This is 'Star Wars' meets 'Lord of the Rings' with a touch of 'Flash Gordon' and the right blend of comedy and dark, sinister tones. This - along with the 'X-Men' franchise - shows how to bring a comic-book onto the big screen and do it so that it feels like a comic-book and also it's own original movie. Plus, stay for the entire credits...it has 2 post-credit scenes as opposed to the usual one).",Thor - The Dark World
532,djx360,Good movie though felt held back than letting loose with the scope Thor Universe has.,7,12 November 2013,"Having mix reactions about the movie, on one hand i loved minor characters like Darcy & her Intern, The Warriors Three were a hoot. In the big league, Loki was awesome as always though his deceptive plot seemed simple than complex which i prefer.Thor was being Thor, while i grow less of a fan of that beard by each passing movie, i do enjoy his dialog delivery. Jane Foster is growing tiresome at least on me, her animated counterpart was better portrayed in Avengers EMH, i guess Natalie Portman can't do much about this one as the cinematic character itself seems to lack scope for development. I really want Marvel to move to Thor & Sif, Sif for the brief period i saw her in Thor tales of Asgard, grew on me quite well.I was looking forward to the Dark Elf but again Thor Tales of Asgard did a better job with Algrim than Dark World with Malekith. Like Man Of Steel the movie can be better experienced in moments than a complete experience, the end credit scene for example just increased my curiosity & some scenes featuring Loki did bring out the best of Thor.I hope the Next Thor movie can build on this.",Thor - The Dark World
533,erinlale,"fun, but don't expect the Aesir of mythology",9,13 November 2013,"I like this movie. I recommend it, for movie fans, for action fans, for Marvel fans, for f/x fans, and even for my fellow heathens -- but for us, I must add the caveat that there are scenes that one might find shocking if one goes into this thinking one is actually watching a story about our gods. Think of the Marvel Thor movies as an alternate universe. I'm not going to list the scenes because I don't want to get too spoiler-y, but...Spoiler alert! Don't read any further if you don't want to read spoilers! Let's just say that at least scene one involves character death. You might not want to take young heathen children who might be confused about the difference between the Marvel Asgardians and the Aesir. It could be upsetting for little Asatru kids to watch a god they honor get killed.There is a lot of ""fantasy violence"" in this movie, so it's probably not one that kids that small would get taken to see anyway, but I thought it was important to warn heathen parents about that.That aside, this is a really enjoyable movie. The effects were seamless. The plot twists never stopped, right up until the end (which left me scratching my head and wondering if I missed a clue somewhere. I really didn't see it coming.)",Thor - The Dark World
534,insessionfilm,Thor: The Dark World is entertaining and fun,8,8 November 2013,"DIRECTION Alan Taylor, mostly known for TV, gets the directors chair for Thor: The Dark World and brings us Thor in some new and fun ways. This version of Thor is much more complex and darker than the first time we met the God of Thunder. The visuals are just as amazing and the main characters get a little more interesting. The camera work is solid, especially when shooting the aerial combat scenes we get. There's also another great shot when we first see Loki and Thor together where Loki is being sarcastic and the camera work almost operates as another character. Not to mention, Taylor throws in some great cameos there. The pacing is very good and there's a great mixture of Thor in action and dialogue that sets up the story. Some of what Taylor is doing can come across off as confusing, especially to new fans but overall what Taylor does is entertaining and fun.Grade: A-SCRIPT The story pretty much picks up right after The Avengers as Thor is now back in his realm making sure that all the realms are at peace. We are introduced to a new alien race that is an old enemy of Asgard. Their secret weapon is eventually found by Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and all the worlds collide (literally) as Thor and Odin try to find a way save Jane and destroy this secret weapon. At the same time, Loki is now in an Asgard prison because of his actions in The Avengers. However, after an attack on Asgard and a tragic incident, Thor must now rely on Loki to help him destroy the enemy. The conflicts created here are interesting and well explored. Much of the dialogue and scenes between Thor and Loki are very funny and well crafted, showing realistically what a brother-brother relationship looks like, but amongst Gods. The story is also very science-y and is heavy on the dialogue that is sometimes hard to keep up with. The main villain isn't that interesting and isn't explored enough to really care about much. Overall, it's still a fun story and the gripping relationship between Thor and Loki keep it engaging.Grade: B+PERFORMANCES Chris Hemsworth has become a defining character in the Marvel universe and hammers down this character well (see what I did there). He's fantastic as usual and brings a wittiness to the character we haven't see much of yet. His action shots, especially with the Hammer are really good. Portman on the other hand is more hit or miss. The character could be written better but for what she's doing she's okay. Portman really didn't want to reprise this role and it's easy to tell in some scenes but overall brings it when it mattered. Tom Hiddleston is unbelievable as Loki. And by unbelievable, I really mean it's hard to believe how believable he is as that character. He's got all the charm and evilness that makes this a fun character. Anthony Hopkins is also great as Odin. I thought he was fantastic in the first Thor movie and again, he's perfect as the Asgard King. The rest of the supporting cast, including the awesome Idris Elba, is very good even though they have little to do overall.Grade: A-SCORE This is perhaps the best Brian Tyler score yet. Tyler's scores in the past haven't been bad but they haven't been stand out worthy either. Patrick Doyle's score for the first Thor is really good and stands out on it's own very well. Tyler doesn't use the same themes here but the theme he does come out with is very good and brings a good element to the film. It's not too distracting but it's also fun to listen to inside and outside of the movie. Without giving anything away, I do want to mention there's an Alan Silvestri theme that plays out in a cameo appearance that's really awesome. The crossovers have even gone into the scores as well. I love it.Grade: AFINAL THOUGHTS Thor: The Dark World is a great continuation in the Marvel Universe and it's a better direction than Iron Man 3. It's entertaining and the relationship between Thor and Loki is great. It's a good step up from the first film and introduces some new characters. The average fan may have a hard time with this though and some elements are tough to care about but overall it's still very enjoyable. Also, if you see it in 3D, there's some awesome footage you'll see of Captain America: The Winter Soldier.Overall Grade: A-",Thor - The Dark World
535,happycalamity,Thor Smashes Back with a Great Sequel,8,3 December 2013,"Thor: Dark World is a sequel to not only the original Thor but also the Avengers. Thor: Dark World picks up right as avengers finished so Thor is back in Asgard with Loki in tow they imprison him then time passes and Thor has brought order back to the nine realms. But the real story begins when Malekith played by Christopher Eccleston reawakens. They explain his back-story with some quick exposition in the very beginning. He and his ship of dark elves are attempting to awaken and control an ancient artifact so they can plunge the nine realms into eternal darkness. Suffice it to say Thor is not interested in the idea of eternal darkness so he sets about stopping it with the help of an unlikely ally. Now with my assessment of Thor: Dark Worlds Action, Acting, Story, and Visuals. Starting with action now if you have seen the original you know there was minimal action there were about 3-5 action sequences in the whole movie. Thor: Dark World quickly fixes that almost every scene is action packed leading up to a fantastic final fight between Thor and Malekith involving worm holes between the realms. So during the final fight they are tackling and hitting each other through wormholes which was a fantastic way to break up the possible monotony of the standard ""THOR SMASH"" which is pretty hard to avoid when making a movie about a character whose main weapon is a hammer. So the final fight is definitely something to look forward to incredibly enjoyable and surprisingly funny. Next the acting, it was very solid good performances all around although Tom Hiddleston really stole the show as Loki delightfully smarmy and smart-alecky throwing witty verbal barbs at Thor when ever they share the screen. The back and forth between Hemsworth and Hiddleston is incredibly enjoyable. I feel I must commend the writers for almost all the Marvel comic movies they do a fantastic job inject humor into their movies in a way that feels very natural and rather than distracting from the story in fact add another layer. Story wise the movie is torn straight from the marvel comics I am almost 100% sure 90% of the world had no idea who Malekith the Betrayer was before this movie. Yet they did a great job introducing him and he proved a very worthy adversary for the mighty thunder god. The story followed a fairly standard story arc although there were a few I didn't see that coming moments. Visually this film was incredible the special effects are getting so good now days that you rarely see a big movie with sub par effects. OVERALL Action 5 out of 5 Stars Acting 4 ½ out of 5 Stars the half is for Hiddleston Story 3 out of 5 Stars it was pretty standard story line with a few surprises Visuals 4 out of 5 Stars standard visuals good though",Thor - The Dark World

I wonder..where the h#ll is Captain America and the Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement and Logistics Department.? I believe Thor is protecting all the nine realms..i wish S.H.I.E.L.D would 'guard' at least one.. Saw Thor -The dark world.. good work Alan Taylor..successfully continued the time-line after Kenneth Branagh and Joss Whedon.. Thor was really desperate to take Loki with him..and in Svartalfheim the most iconic villain in MCU meets his redemption.. excellent job by Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston.. I do believe before the universe there was darkness and it has Survived. I hope it survives till the next Convergence. its a Marvel movie, at-least one important characters have to be sacrificed of course.. For now the nine realms are safe and In Thor We Trust!",Thor - The Dark World
537,mikesmithspeed,Good Movie I like It,8,2 July 2015,"The acting was solid and good. The production value was super. Everything else was really wonderful. It's totally different from the first part of Thor. I like this movie and want to watch again. There are very some good things this movie. The guy Loki is one of the only one redeeming qualities of this movie and he is very convincing. The Stan Lee Cameo is also great and funny like always. There is a awesome twist I wont spoil. But that's about it.The only reason for I am writing this review is, because as i have seen the the other reviews here are either someone hated it totally or thought. I would like to say about this movie, It was the best movie they ever saw. The truth is somewhere in the middle, Thor will never be the best movie you ever saw. If you think its the worst ever then you have not seen Dragonball evolution.I am totally enjoyed this movie. I loved when they showed Loki broken down due to the death that went along with it. The scene with the funeral was beautifully done, as well. I also was really caught off guard when they cut off Thor's hand, it was such a good surprise, even though it was a bad thing. There was still a good flow to the movie.",Thor - The Dark World
538,Vinzz,Fun little mess of a movie,6,11 November 2013,"Yes, Loki is fun to watch on screen. Yes, I like Kat Dennings character. Yes, there are some funny lines/scenes. Yes, the special effects are numerous and generally well-done. But too many negatives otherwise. No, I don't know anything about the villain. No, I don't understand the villain's motivation. No, I don't understand what they hope to achieve with the thing they are trying to acquire. No, I don't understand the 'weapon' and what it does (other than, 'bad stuff'). No, I don't really care about the good characters. No, the climactic battle didn't make much logical sense at all. I suppose if you've been collecting Thor comics forever, then all of it would make sense and you would already care about the characters. However, if you come into this without that background, be prepared for 2 hours of apathetic munching of popcorn, broken by an occasional smile. It's a summer movie, just a few months too late.",Thor - The Dark World

Great story people might want to see again to understand it all if are much Keen . Loved the action and amazing effects .Loki's repetitive role, the way it was shown predictably that he would be alive was poor, it should have been a lot better and would have earned a more remarkable ""wow"" factor which was missed and looked ordinary that yes Thor 3 is coming or Loki is going to continue as enemy in Marvel's one of next .Thor 1 is still a lot better than this . Anthony Hopkins's role as king looked short in command , with less army shown and premature weapons with them and in Asgard like just laser guns . When enemies breached for Odin's wife, no guards were there. Years passed by in the movie and in real for making Thor 2 obvious, so should have been better with small things too . Will be very disappointing if we see that Loki has actually killed Odin and has taken over in the next .

543,girishprabhu11,Best Marvel movie of the year.,10,12 November 2013,"Thor 2 - The Dark World , I believe is the best Marvel movie of the year. Popular avenger Iron 3 really had a very bad impact on fans like me but thanks to the crew for pulling up socks and making ""my favorite superhero"" movie this good. Well, I cannot simple say its a flawless film but it emerges our expectations in a good way. Attractive Asgard is a beautiful realm made, and the special / visual effects in the movie are possibly the award winning feature. Good mixture of comedy and drama. Thor with his usual knack humor has done extremely well (*phew* there was lot of hype on Loki). THOR! WOW! The character is perfectly drawn, his strength is depicted very well from the comic Thor. Plus Hemsworth is perfect for the character and I believed it since previous Thor. Little ambiguities in terms of story line especially Jane getting affected by the Aether as if it was simply made to make sure Thor will have a girlfriend beside her, but thanks to Natalie, she gives justice to the character. ""Another"" - Thor missed saying it though. *giggles*",Thor - The Dark World
544,MrDude_o_o,Now this is how a comic-book film should be made,10,1 November 2013,"I'm pretty grateful to the makers of the film; as I left the theater, I had that feeling which I haven't felt since the 90s. There is not one single unnecessary, exaggerated, dull or boring scene (some events which could easily be told by cliché scenes are artistically presented) and this is a sign that the film-makers of Thor: The Dark World take what they do serious and respect the audience. So we had everything we expect from a good comic-book film, beautiful visuals, fight scenes (neither long nor meaningless), fun chemistry between Thor and Loki, intelligent twists and tricks, great acting by Hopkins and Hiddleston, funny moments which made the audience laugh out loud. Go and see it, great entertainment. (Don't leave the theater during the credits, you know, it's a Marvel film.)",Thor - The Dark World
545,ouxhan,You should lower your expectations,4,2 November 2013,"I watched the movie yesterday in the evening and honestly I did not enjoy it at all. Firstly we were shown 50 minutes ( yes 50 minutes!) of advertisement. I can proudly say I know all the kid's toys now.I was expecting much more better Thor movie however I was wrong. First half was ""Narnia"" and the second half was ""London City Guide for Tourists"" founded by some ministers probably. Odin was same , he always makes mistakes and Thor is always right. It was very weird to watch how they connect Jane Foster character and her fellow friends to the movie . Things happening all the time without any sense. Crazy weirdo scientists ( Hollywood likes to show weirdo crazy British scientist lately - Pasific Rim - Agents of Shield etc..), a very bad villain and thousands of Asgardian Guardians (Lets say headless chickens), very amateur Asgardian King( I do not even let him to drive my car, he is the king of stupidity.). I do not believe someone else could write this movie worse than them. 110 minutes of getting bored just to watch a complete disaster. By the way weirdos saved the universe with a game-boy and couple of sticks. We do not need any superhero anymore.If you are 12 okay you will enjoy I am sure. Stay away!!.And to Hollywood : Guys OK you can make special effects but please learn how to shoot a proper movie.",Thor - The Dark World

Not like Iron man, that I really liked only to see a really bad sequel and a not so good second sequel, this movie delivers all the way. A really good cast, a story fit for this movie, heaps of action, great special effects and balanced and effective humor made this a real fun experience. I will not give anything away but I do recommend you stay in your seat till the very end!! There is to much to write down here and you should see it for yourself but this is up there with the Avengers and Spiderman 1 and 2, it's just that good and that much fun.

I think that the first thor movie is not that great, so I came to the theater with no high expectation. But this movie is actually awesome. The story is great, the duration's not too long, nor too short, it's enough. The casts are great. Chris played thor well. He showed the emotion, but still can keep his arrogance. The effect is amazing. I watched it in 2D (because for me, 3D just ruin the story), but I can still feel the effect. There are some little joke that actually made this movie better. The audiences cant stop laughing during the movie. So for conclusion, this movie is great, I think its better than the previous one.",Thor - The Dark World
548,ieuah,"Great fight scenes, but a weak villain.",7,23 November 2013,"Thor: The Dark World is packed with great action scenes, which is what you get when you add Alan Taylor to the mix. There is no shaky cam, which I find tends to get a bit disorienting, and the camera has you right in the middle of all the battles. There is also a lot of humour, more so than in the first instalment of Thor. But I do have a couple of gripes about this film. At the start of the film, which deals with a bit of Asgardian history, Thor's grandfather hides the Aether where ""no-one will ever find it."" You'd think then that some human scientist wouldn't stumble across it very easily not even half an hour into the film. Also, the villain Malekith was very disappointing. Christopher Eccleston did a good job, but there is no back-story to Malekith, his motives are never fully explained, the audience doesn't get a true sense of who he is, his power is underplayed (I thought) and all in all he's just a rather weak antagonist. Finally, Darcy. Annoying, not particularly funny, adds nothing to the film, I just don't know why she's there. And the intern has as intern? Okay, whatever. But apart from that, I really enjoyed it, great action, and a rather satisfying ending.",Thor - The Dark World
549,viktor_ilarionov,Not that Good,3,7 February 2014,"The movie offers a great fictional realm (Asgard) it is so rich and unique, but the improper cast of the movie often remind us that it is fake. I'm not talking about Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddelson or God forbid Anthony Hopkins those guys are well casted and did their jobs well. The story of Thor is based of the scandinavic myths and songs and in the movie Thor more or less acts as a viking and looks like one too everything in Asgard is made to mimic the Scandinavian culture or perception of Asgard after all thats where the sourse is from and it is such a bummer when you see that Heimdall is cast as black nothing against Idris Elba great actor but thats not how Scandinavians describe it in their songs thats not how it is even in the comic book sourse and what about Thour's gang one of them fights with rapier the other one is Asian thanks god he does not fight with nunchaku although that would make more sense.

550,devanshsharma50,Thor'ough Enjoyment,10,26 November 2013,"This movie rocks. Everything is in complete synchronization with the plot. i watched this movie twice and i am still looking forward to watch it again. Chris Hemsworth is excellent as usual but Tom Hiddleston has done more than excellent work in this movie as Loki. His character, acting and dialogues are exactly what we want to see. it is like having Heath Ledger from The Dark Knight as the Joker.others to look forward to are Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins and Christopher Eccleston. this movie is darker than all the marvel phase-1 movies and is a lot better than it's predecessor. Loki is the best thing that happened to this movie. if Loki was not in the movie, i would have rated it 8/10. The second half is clearly better than the first half. But the first half consists of some excellent scenes like Frigga's funeral which are beautifully shot and create magic. The final battle is packed with action and a much anticipated kiss between Darcy and Ian. Stellan Skarsgård as Erik Selig adds up humour in the film side-by-side with Loki disguising as captain America. this movie makes up for enjoyable watching.Thor'ough Enjoyment",Thor - The Dark World
551,duckdodger242003,"Another outstanding effort, Marvel does it yet again!",10,31 October 2013,"It's hard to believe that a movie with this subject matter can make you think as much as it thrills you and makes you laugh. Yet, this film does just that. It really does appeal to all of your movie viewing skills. It's very artistic and you would expect no less from a director that crafted Game of Thrones. He presents the entire film in a way that can be savored. Many aspects are classical drama and yet other aspects are just plain old fun kick-butt action scenes. It's a perfect blend and this movie is far deeper then I would've thought. The pacing was perfect as is the indirect link to the Marvel movie Universe... I can't wait to see what Captain America brings us in his sequel.Also, I absolutely love the character of Loki because there was so much texture to the character. He's the perfect Marvel villain. He was complex but with a tinge of madness mixed in and perfectly written for the film. The rationale for what he does and how he behaves is masterful. I truly loved how Loki was written and portrayed. Then again, I honestly can say that about all the main characters. Thor and Jane really are allowed to shine here as well.My main critique after watching the first film was the instance romance between Jane and Thor. After watching this movie, you buy the love at first sight scenario boosted by the situational intrigue. This time around, the pace of the film really worked well. I can't remember a film that grabs you like they do right off the bat and never lets go but does it with intelligence and heart. Hard to argue any editorial cuts at this point whatever they may have been.Overall, a movie that's superior to everything else that I've seen this year.",Thor - The Dark World
552,m-hertzler,It Has its Moments but Fails to Rise Above Mediocrity,6,8 March 2014,"What can I say? Yet another mediocre output from Marvel, sure it's not bad, in fact, it's completely watchable but is that all we demand from blockbusters anymore?Though, that is not to say Thor 2 is without its merits. It's greatest achievement is perhaps it's absolutely flawless production design. I'll congratulate the fellow who could find a single fault within the sets, costumes, make-up and/or CGI and even directing and acting. Moreover there are more than a handful of Grade A action/comedy sequences that truly transcend the film and may I say, are completely kickass.But there are some major things wrong with the film and with a production this flawless, the blame can only fall on one spot... The writing.As a screenwriter myself I got a lot to complain about here, I'll try to keep it short but get ready for a roast...Character development is lacking with no real motivation for the Dark Elves actions and no significant growth in Thor or other characters by the end of the film. The pacing is uneven and sporadic, with way too many breaks for exposition. Which brings me to..Too many things set up and not enough payoffs, ex: whatever happened to the Asian guy in the beginning? I would have loved to see that tie together to something at the end.And lastly, there is a lack of momentum and sense of scale to the story. Instead of a slow build to a giant payoff the movie sort of meanders and wanders. Worst of all , even though apparently the entire universe is on the line it never feels that way. I mean what the hell?! the Dark Elf invasion of earth is like one ship and a few dozen soldiers..End roast.Long story short, Thor 2 is a beautiful film to look at but overall suffers from a script that doesn't do justice to the material. Though, despite the scripts numerous shortcomings it has just enough moments of brilliance to keep you watching all the way through. If you keep your expectations low you'll have a decent time with the movie, just don't expect much.",Thor - The Dark World

He's back for a third time on our big screens, but this time things appear to be a bit darker and Thor becomes more desperate for help. I felt the first Thor movie was good, but could of been a lot better as I felt it lacked in the action side of things and concentrated more on humor. The Avengers movie showed more of Thor's strength and abilities but I still felt like he was holding back.The story of the film shows Thor (Chris Hemsworth), making up for Loki's (Tom Hiddleston) mistakes by clearing up the nine rounds 'planets', and shows that he doesn't feel like he belongs anymore and misses his mortal lover, Jane (Natalie Portman). He soon manages to reunite with her, but an evil elf named Malekith returns from the past to destroy everything in his path. Thor soon realizes he cannot do this alone, and takes desperate measures by asking Loki for help but the question is can Thor trust him?This new film is the definition of awesomeness. This time we get to see a lot more action, which is both clever as well as fun. We see the hammer used a lot more and we see more of Thor's strength, which helps to prove that he isn't a god to mess with! Marvel have always been clever with there humor and I feel this film is the funniest so far, yes even better than Iron Man 3! It manages to make you laugh even in the more serious of moments. Christopher Eccleston I felt brought a lot to the role of Malekith, despite the face he was unrecognizable, his voice managed to bring originality as well as the sense of darkness that was needed. In the first movie I felt it was hard to connect with Thor, as he is obviously a God, who is hard to be beaten. However in this film I felt more connected, as you could sense his emotional pain, which is mainly loneliness.If you like action, a good laugh as well as a good story, then please go and see this amazing film!

555,annasuwinski,Thor: The Confusing World,6,2 February 2014,"I remembered my initial thought when watching this movie for the first time; I thought it was utter crap. First of all, I didn't understand what was going on and I keep wondering when the real plot line will begin when it was already half of the movie. Things felt it like it was a blur, it was moving too fast but it didn't have content. I felt rather confused after watching the movie. I had to consult with my friend who is a comic expert in order to fully understand the movie. Based on that, I thought the movie did very poorly. What do I think about it now? After watching it for a second time in better quality, I was able to piece things together better. However, keep in mind that I researched and knew more about the plot line from another source. Because of that, I still feel that the movie did poorly. Not as poorly as my initial judgement but still rather poor especially after watching and comparing it to the first movie. They had a good thing going on in Thor 1 as it was different from other Superhero movies; it centred around the character rather than the action. They should have stick to this formula, but I guess after the launching of the Avengers movie, they were high on action steroids. Not to say that action movies are bad. They are definitely interesting. I just think they were trying too hard in this movie, which complicate it. I know that a lot of people and myself included watched this movie as we were already invested in the characters, especially Loki. And that was basically the only part that hold up the movie; Loki. Without him, the movie would definitely fall apart. He had the only emotional depth and lines of the movie. The dark elves plot line and another infinity stone made it rather difficult for people to digest or understand the movie. Now as a comic book fan and reader, I knew a bit about it and I was still left rather confused. So, I would just imagine how people who did not read the comics felt like; maybe ignorant is bliss? It made more sense though when it was explained and made it a better movie. For example, the place where Jane stumbled on and got infected was suppose to be the hardest place to find. However, she found it rather easily. So how do I judge this? as it was an 'OK' movie after I knew the facts but it was a poor movie before I looked into it. Nothing much to touch on the cinematography. It was still good. No complains there. Everything looked believable and the shots used in the movie were good. I was disappointed in the score though. I guess it suited the movie as it was rather fast paced which is reflected in the score. It wasn't the emotional build up that was created by Patrick Doyle in the first movie. I hope if they do another Thor movie they will learn from this second movie mistake and revert back to the first movie's simplicity; more insight on the characters. If not, then I say forget about doing another Thor movie and just do a Loki movie. I mean, that's what the fans actually really want.",Thor - The Dark World
556,atedmon2,Unfavorable Thor 2 Review,4,8 January 2014,"This movie's only saving grace was every scene with Loki, who sadly isn't going to be in Avengers 2 according to Joss Whedon. This film spent way too much time with Natalie Portman and her throw-away friend characters trying to dish out quirky comedic relief, which resulted in painfully unfunny scenes that dragged and dragged and dragged... I'm not sure what it is about Natalie Portman's acting but for me it was excruciatingly reminiscent of her Queen Amidala performance. Her acting tends to be pretty hit or miss for me but these Thor movies just haven't been doing her any favors. The relationship she has with Thor is so unconvincing and bland that the movie can't even be bothered to tack on a little farewell scene for the both of them when Chris Hemsworth goes back to Asgard at the end. It cares that little. Also, generic evil bad guy is more undefined than any other super villain the Marvel movie universe has come up with so far. Why is it so difficult to write a memorable antagonist in these movies?",Thor - The Dark World
557,anthonyjdedrickjr,Better than reviews let on,7,8 May 2020,This was the last MCU movie I had to see and it was quite enjoyable. I liked it better than the first one. Not quite as good Ragnarok.,Thor - The Dark World
558,swiss422,A visually stunning mess,3,23 February 2014,"Gotta say, digital eye candy can be pretty astonishing. Wish I could look at the worlds they created all day. Screensaver maybe?But as for what's going on in front of all this stunning art direction, it's all pretty ridiculous and confusing. Honestly, by the end I just got tired of things smashing and breaking for no real reason, and found myself desperately hoping the thing would just end already. The scenes with Loki were the film's saving grace; while he was around, I found myself interested. But trying to make sense out of all the rest of this slop just made me tired and frustrated. I'd gladly watch about half of it again with the sound off, and I recommend the film highly to the deaf community.Surprised to see it's so highly rated here. Well, I guess that's what passes for entertainment today.",Thor - The Dark World
559,zorrorojo8,Villain?,7,23 February 2021,"Movie was great except for the villain. I felt like Thor destroyed a rather weak villain too quickly. It was a very fun movie and overall enjoyed this film. Not the best Thor movie, but not the worst.",Thor - The Dark World
560,wormhole9000,Awful unwatchable rubbish,1,22 March 2016,"AWFUL GARBAGE MOVIE!!! Saw this garbage on Starz the other night and wished I could get those hours of my life back. The movie was way too underdeveloped and zoomed through the plot, me and my son could not understand what was going on at times and we could not keep hold of the characters., with the exception of Loki. In addition the last hour or so of the movie became terribly predictable and extremely boring. But regardless...this movie was terrible and awful. The characters were just so superficial and very one dimensional that I did not give a hoots to what happened to any of them. Apparently the universe was in trouble, and this film managed to make that concept completely boring and uninspired. Leave end of world stuff to X-men movies. They do it better. There were also a few pitiful..attempts at humor thrown into the movie. Which were all extremely kiddie...and..childish...they fell flat...and in fact were so ""unfunny"" they made me cringe. I had to watch X-men movies after this to remind myself why I look comic book films.",Thor - The Dark World

Everything from the saturation to the action scenes just felt sleep-inducingly boring. Loki has charm, but the other characters seem to have lost theirs.

The movie was way too fast paced, we could not absorb what was going on at times and we could not grab hold of the characters., with the exception of Loki. Plus the last hour or so of the movie became terribly predictable and simply boring. The first two Iron Man movies were fantastic, the first Thor and Captain America movies were great, but not with the disappointment of Iron Man 3 and not Thor 2 I feel that the Avengers franchise has lost its steam.... I have a feeling that too many hands are in the pot now in these movies and it is ruining the quality. I only hope that it doesn't carry over to the Star Wars franchise.",Thor - The Dark World
564,tt-nuda,one too many jokes?,7,7 November 2013,"Plot is much much better than the first movie, not that it was bad before. There is bait too much Jokes I think... It's all fun an game, but when the serious moment arrived the seriousness didn't get to peak ... because the joke lighted the mood over all of the movie. All characters got a moment which is great for the actors, maybe not as much for the movie it self... the time get chopped up bait too much. Some of the lines are bait too cheesy.I felt like they promoted the fun too much and not enough sadness or heaviness as it should have been but that could also been the preview's faults since it looks so sad, dark and dramatic in the trailer... but that being said it's a bast seeing the movie. The landscape of the worlds is much much better we see more and it feels more real.... there is a physical location being shown geographically which is great. Love the ending... altho i totally saw it coming... The best serious moment for me was maybe when we see Logi all broken before he got out...",Thor - The Dark World
565,dols-j,Really enjoyable movie,8,2 November 2013,"Went to see this yesterday and had a great time watching this. It was great to see a bit more of Asgard this time around although would have also loved some more of the rest of the realms itself. Loved that they showed Vanaheim in the beginning. Lots of humour already right from the start of the movie & that continued throughout the movie. Gripping one liners & nice little surprises like the ""Captain America"" appearance, which had the room bursting out with laughter yesterday. Also loved the insight we got into Loki's soul after what happened to Frigga. It gave the character more depth & explains why he does end up siding with Thor after all. They all did a brilliant job on the fight sequences, loved watching those as they weren't extremely long. Great CGI stuff although a bit obvious when they had to do close ups. It's shot in a darker light ( if that makes sense ) but I liked that bit as the movie tone is set in a darker mood. The chemistry between Jane & Thor was better compared to the 1 st movie IMO. I believe Hemsworth was a better Thor as he had to grow into his character in the 1st movie, whereas Hiddleston owned the Loki character from the 1st minute he put on the horns. At least that is how I perceived it. Heimdall was awesome & I liked that he got more screen time this movie. Was expecting more from Malekith movie wise, missed some of that darkness that really started of this war..Tom Hiddleston as Loki however stole the show as Hiddleston has embraced this character completely & is totally in touch with how Loki should be portrayed.The ending made me grin as I had a serious ""Hell No!"" Moment at a certain point in the movie, just sitting in my seat shaking my head in disbelief...but I shouldn't have worried really.Worth the wait & looking forward to seeing the next instalment!",Thor - The Dark World
566,maxiam_us,Thor 2 Rocks!,9,3 December 2013,"The mighty protector of the Nine Realms soars once again in the very first movie made of arguably Marvel Comics' strongest Avenger, the Mighty Thor! Yes, I said ""first movie"", and this will be expounded on later. Anyway, ""The Dark World"", besides being an actual Thor film, may also be the greatest ""Masters of the Universe"" film ever made as well. Watching the beauty of Asgard and the other realms, or the combination of science fiction and fantasy tropes(Elves wielding laser guns! Rocket-powered flying longboats with energy missiles!) reminded me of Eternia and the struggles of its Heroic Warriors versus the Evil Warriors(I prefer the 2000s Masters of the Universe versus the Evil Warriors). In fact, while thoroughly enjoying Marvel's latest cinematic offering, I wished that some movie company would produce a new He-Man film, using ""The Dark World"" as a springboard.The film revolves around the titular hero(played by Chris Hemsworth) who, after fighting in the Battle Of New York, has returned to his duty as the champion of the Nine Realms, striving for peace between them after the destruction of the Bifrost Bridge in the first film installment. Meanwhile, Jane Foster(Natalie Portman) and Darcy(Kat Dennings) have been searching the Earth for the Thunder God for the last two years, while their companion Dr. Erik Selvig(Stellan Skarsgard), suffering from the effects of Loki's(Tom Hiddleston) mental manipulation in ""The Avengers"", has seemingly gone ""bananaballs"", ranting about protecting the Earth in ""The Convergence"" of the Nine Realms.However, his delusions are justified by the film's main villain, Malekith(Christopher Eccleston), the ruler of the primordial Dark Elves of Svartalfheim, who wants to return the mulitiverse to the darkness that predated creation. Aided by his number two, Algrim(Adewale Akinnuyoe-Agbage), he searches for ""The Aether"", a liquid-type weapon of pure darkness that he created millennia before to do the horrendous deed. Luckily(or unluckily), the weapon possesses Jane Foster, setting the conflict between Thor and Malekith in motion.And where is Loki in all of this? Well, you would just have to see, now will you?""The Dark World"" is an awesome cinematic science fantasy struggle against good and evil, finally giving fans an exploration and expansion on Marvel's version of Teutonic/Norse Mythology. From the desolate blackened crags of Svartalfheim to the gilded spires of Asgard, we finally get to see Thor in his natural element, battling giant stone men, partying with his fellow Asgardians(to a minor degree), and having heart-to-heart talks with his father Odin(Anthony Hopkins) and all-seeing Heimdall(Idris Elba). Thankfully, the references to the Avengers Universe are minor, a detriment, in my opinion, of the first movie.In fact, with the focus being only on Thor, the Thunder God comes across as a character worthy of comparison to the Distinguished Competition's Man of Steel, as powerful, immortal, protector of planets with adventures on global and universal scopes. Close your eyes, and Asgard shares many similarities with Krypton(of course, it would be the other way around, as Asgard predates Krypton by several millennia). As a benefit of this, the film expands on the roles of Thor's supporting cast, including Heimdall, Freya(Rene Russo), and Odin, while adding a new Fandral(Zachery Levi) and shrinking Hogun's(Tadanobu Asano)'s role. Fans also get a chance to see Nine Realm technology, such as the longboats and armed Elves I mentioned beforehand. The humor, one of the only positives of the first movie, is still here as well, whether it is how Darcy gains Jane's attention when she was on a date to how Dr. Selvig dresses when he has to ""think"".I saw nothing wrong about this film. It is a very entertaining superhero action movie. Beyond Hogun's reduced role, and maybe the glossing over of a love triangle between Lady Sif(Jaime Alexander), Jane, and Thor, this film still gets an A from me. However, as I mentioned before, I consider this the actual FIRST Thor film. The one before it was not a Thor film to me, and is one of the weakest entries in Marvel Studio's library. Why? Because it was more about introducing Thor and Loki for the following ""Avengers"" film than introducing any of Thor's actual comic mythology. At least ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" explored his origins and mythology, while telling an awesome superhero yarn. The first ""Thor"" was more of a by-the-numbers introductory hero chapter, more set-up for ""The Avengers"" than anything that could stand on its own.",Thor - The Dark World
567,paulboyowhite,Terrible is too good a word,3,9 February 2014,OK so I am going to get straight to the point.This movie is one I was really looking forward to watching.The first Thor movie was one of my favorite super hero movies of all time.This was NOT. For a big budget movie with a big budget cast it left me feeling like I had wasted my time watching it.I can't single out anything in particular that was bad as the whole thing just felt like filler material. The baddies are lacking any real threat and this time round I just found that both thor and Loki did nothing worth remembering.I am not expecting much from the next Captain America either but it cant be worse than this.For me this is up there with Catwoman and both Fantastic Four movies,Thor - The Dark World
568,berzinam,Entertaining and Inspirational,9,3 May 2014,"I was really waiting for this movie to come out as recently I have really fell in love with Marvels work. And because I have seen the first part of Thor (I know I haven't reviewed it yet but I will) and really liked not only the overall concept of it, but also how it has been made for viewers to enjoy.Although IMDb suggests that this is an action, adventure and fantasy genre movie I would definitely add comedy to this list as well. You will see in this post later on few silly quotes I fancied, but believe me - there was a lot more where it came from! I was laughing really often although others in the cinema weren't quite as much, so it gets back to your sense and level of humor.Story totally fascinated me by its moving around the time ans space and how it all fit together. Although partly I wished I could get to know other worlds as well but they managed to connect every story on the timeline quite good.This movie totally inspired me at the time I really needed it and especially by showing me really well made bad character. He was gruesome, ingenious, evil and overall resentful. Although from the story I understood that their species weren't left a lot, but in the movie it seemed like quite a lot of them fought and died, and fought more, I would have wanted to understand - where did they came from? Born suddenly, and if so then how? But this was the only thing I couldn't understand as one super strong warrior can't be at all places at the same time to win the war, right?Although I couldn't understand why the quality of effects changed during the movie from really crappy made ones to really great, overall I really enjoyed this movie and will definitely watch it few time more.",Thor - The Dark World
569,rich-grindell,An unaccomplished sequel,6,9 June 2018,"As per Marvel studios the production, effects, costumes etc were fantastic, certainly provided a spectacle. 
The plot however was (to sound like a douche critic) fairly contrived. Followed a very basic formula with little depth and character development. 
I found it kept my attention moreso towards the end and the individual performances were well acted, given what they had to work with. Put it this way, the mid end credits scene crammed more plot into 30 seconds (and an intriguing performance from Benicio del Toro) than most of the film.",Thor - The Dark World
570,mex1997,Excellent!,7,2 November 2013,"Thor was arrogant and impulsive and learned to become more worthy . Thor : The Dark World begins an amazing way showing a great view of the mythology behind the 9 realms , the threat generated by the Dark Elves that have Ether that the course of the film becomes the real danger , then we have an already created for the development of the plot . We have an excellent view of the whole essence of the comic book Thor , the costumes and special effects contribute in an extensive Experience the general performances performed by the actors are convincing , the villainous Malekith is well interpreted and demonstrates a true cause for their action, Loki once again steals the show and keeps a large treacherous and leaving everyone in a state of attention to each step taken by him . Throughout the film we have a load of jokes and acceptable contrapartes , the mythology is explored very well in the movie as references to various occasions , the special effects are excellent , the soundtrack is good and demonstrates a balance between action of the moment. The film has problems like lack of direction in relation to the romance between Thor and Jane Foster and causes get stressed enough , in the final moments of the film lacks a bit of understanding . and we also have references to the Marvel universe , and stay until the end because there is 2 scenes after credits ; Thor : The Dark World is a great movie and one of the best ever made by Marvel Studios , is well worth watching.",Thor - The Dark World
571,zig_utzig,"Probably not as dark as you might think it is, not bad though",7,8 November 2013,"The title of this second instalment of ""Thor"" may lead spectators to believe this is a dark movie and less humorous than the first one, but that is very far from the truth. Actually this second film is even more comical than the first, for the good or for the bad. I say this because the frequent humour in ""The Dark World"" bothered some fans while pleased others. As I was watching it I did think some of the comical scenes were a little over the top and others even unnecessary, but generally I very much welcomed the humorous touch. Some of the scenes that put a completely characterized Thor through trivial human situations were very funny. Cameos were also very well used (there's even a special appearance from one of Thor's colleagues from The Avengers). Stan Lee's cameo in this one was one of my favourites from all Marvel films.Another thing that some fans complained about was the motivation (or lack of it) from the villains, the dark elves. Well, it's hard to put in a 2 hour action movie too many explanations without taking the risk of spoiling the pace of the movie. However the explanation in the beginning seemed clear to me, even being quite superficial. I don't read comic books (so I don't have any reference from them), but when the narrator said that dark elves are a race born prior to the birth of light and they want to spread again the dark energy across the universe, their motivation was pretty clear. I mean, unlike humans or asgardians (who were born from light), dark elves were born from dark energy and they simply want that energy taking over light as the moving force in the universe. Dark energy, which is represented in the movie by the alchemical element known as ""aether"", is considered a natural force in many mythologies and philosophies and is also a widely accepted theory among today's astrophysicists. So asking what is the purpose of the dark elves is the same as asking what is the purpose of dark energy, and that is a philosophical question.The spaceships battle scenes in Asgard were also a point that raised complaints. The movie creators were definitely inspired by Star Wars here, even the spaceships designs are quite similar (X-Wings for the good guys and Tie Fighters for the bad ones). I was not bothered as I saw the movie because I am a big fan of Star Wars (especially the original trilogy), but I understand that crossing fantasy/mythology with science fiction might not please some people, even if this crossing has always been present in Thor. I also have no complaints about CGI or sound effects, I think the movie is technically great (as every other movie produced by Marvel).Lastly, characters and acting. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddlestone) are the movie's stars and they are perfect in their roles. Along with Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man and Chris Evans as Captain America they are the best casting in The Avengers, in my opinion. I have no criticism to their work. Anthony Hopkins is again excellent as Odin and Rene Russo is just average as Frigga (she certainly does not inspire majesty to me). Stellan Skasgard is again exceptional as Dr. Erik Selvig (crazier than ever) and Cristopher Eccelstone plays a just reasonably evil Malekith (I was much more afraid of the excellent Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Algrim). Natalie Portman as Jane Foster does a good job despite her character being a little too bland; she plays much more the ""defenceless little girl"" type than in the first movie and that was a bit disappointing. The rest of the cast did well as they did in the first movie, some playing comical parts (Kat Dennings) and others more serious ones (Idris Elba). So Thor: The Dark World is one more movie from Marvel Studios that combines action, comedy and science fiction, but with the ""bonus"" touch of Nordic mythology. If you enjoyed the first one I recommend you to check this sequel.My rating: 7/10",Thor - The Dark World
572,lordarislan,not better than Thor #1,6,17 November 2013,"the movie was OK and i wish i did not pay $13:50 to see it but i needed to kill time and since i liked Thor since it aired back in the 70's at 3pm weekdays after school along with iron man, the hulk, and spider man. but i was let down i don't understand who gave this over 7 it is a 6.5 maybe 6.7 at best. i guess i just expect more from a superhero movie especially after seeing the dark knight, iron man, man of steel, etc. i would wait for it to come out on DVD, and i wouldn't spend the extra cash for blue-ray. but don't get me wrong its not bad, but it's also not good enough, and the extra endings after the credits is getting real tired, real quick. i guess it'll piece itself altogether one the infinity gauntlet is together and probably a nice set up for avengers 2.",Thor - The Dark World
573,jobyjohnp,trying to kiss gaming buts?,2,18 March 2014,"Not much of expectation. But. The movie was so boring and unreal. No story and felt like it's trying to imitate role playing game themes. Not much of a real story. The second quarter felt intriguing. But after that it plunged to the sewers :D. There was no story. And it's a shame of what they did with the potential of good graphics. Spoiler alert in next few lines. Trying to pose Loki as changed person as a twist? Too Predictable. What was more annoying was getting rid of him instantly. If you dig in a twist in story, you let it sink, not flush it away. They should try to make a low selling game instead. Hope the mistakes are learnt and the pathetic twist and prequel to possible 5 to go are made better. watchable :p. Adios",Thor - The Dark World
574,wazzic,You have seen this before. Watch something else.,3,9 November 2013,"Walking out of Thor: The Dark World I felt I just watched Transformers: Dark of the Moon again. It has the spit out formula that blockbuster movies like Iron Man 2 have. It feels like TV has another spin off cop show. The CGI is big-budget, but the story here has hardly any suspense and is boring. The movie reuses the short action, talking, villain creates problem, talking, and conclusion plot line. The movie starts with a small-scale fight with irrelevant enemies to introduce Thor. Then Jane messes with a portal while an ancient vengeful antagonist who lost long ago shows up, all the way to the mid-point when Marvel recreates the Star Wars The Phantom Menace battle with the energy shield dome and two armies run at each other, and it ends shortly, to restart in the ending. Thor has no weaknesses and he needs Loki for distraction. Describing the ending in one sentence sounds like the premise of The Avengers ending. Save your money for the next Marvel movie. I wrote this review this morning and six hours have passed and I have forgotten most of the movie.",Thor - The Dark World
575,vladasulinskas,And in this movie you will see... everything you have seen many and many times before,5,1 February 2014,"My opinion about this movie will be clearly opposite from the most of the rest viewers. Not because I hate comics, neither because I love them so much that I can't take any deviations in the movies from the printed original versions of the stories. It is because this movie was dull, boring and full of almost painful clichés. If you have seen previous Marvel movies, here you won't find nothing new, except, of course, new villains. A very huge flaw is the plot as it is duplicate of the casual superheroes saving planet Earth movies. There is an exiled great evil - the ark Elf Malekith who lost against Asgardians and for some reason waited eons of years for revenge, his seemingly unbeatable (of course, falling because of cheesy trick at the end of the movie) sidekick for dirty work Kurse, lots of not so clever minions made to be beaten buy the good guys. Most of the movie is about how they have their vengeance and obtain the all-powerful universe destroying weapon Aether. Then there are some good guys who help hero just before the culmination of the action, over concerned father Odin, a hated traitor Loki who, of course, sacrifices at the time of need, a hero's girlfriend Jane Foster who is to be saved. And naturally almighty hero Thor who suffers from personal life problems. In this movie they even have a demented scientist and incapable of performing everyday cares Jane's friends but who also happen to be extremely helpful than the Earth is attacked by super powerful evil entity. The villains to destroy the universe yet again will have to attack the poor Earth where they lose (though after winning in Asgard against gods). Despite all this sarcasm I can say that the last scene of the movie was great and was the only part not according to the usual superhero film script plan. By the way, there is additional extra scene just after the credits... Acting, in my opinion, was average. It could be because of the fact that in such type of movies there are only few characters who have development. Cast was good but exceptional performances were made by those who played the bad guys - Christopher Eccleston (Malekith) and, Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Chris Hemsworth is probably the best possible actor as Thor. Others, however, did not shine so bright. Even Academy Awards winners Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman did not looked so perfect as they always do. Most people enjoy screening of comic book based movies because greatly executed special effects and entertaining fight scenes, especially if it is in 3D. More than a half of movie consists action scenes, so you will get both heaped. However, fight scenes are boring and predictable since you can tell before even they start whose time has come to lose and die. Fight scenes look messy although both inventive as creators mash up medieval, modern warfare and Star Wars like weaponry at the same time. Landscapes seem much improved form Thor 1. Soundtrack and cinematography? There reason why people usually don't talk about them in comic book based movies... There are a lot of jokes, some of which are cheesy one liners and some are fairly descent. This slows down the tension. In overall it is not a bad movie. Had great potential with strong cast, great visual effects, great director Alan Taylor and astronomical budget. However, its predictability, lack of creativity and clichés kill the interest in the movie for those who are not Marvel movie fans.",Thor - The Dark World
576,nhanguyen,"Not only about war, but also about love and lost",9,31 October 2013,"Comparing with the last movie, this movie is far better, because they are deeper, logical, the story is far better.The humor factors has decreased slightly compared to other Marvel movies. i thought that movies of Marvel are always funny, humor but for this movie, they have put seriousness and darkness on this,making this movie more that just an action, fighting blockbuster. Although i kindly didn't like it since i prefer more humor. For other movies like Iron Man, you laugh most of the time. But for this movie, there are many silent moments in the cinema. Its not only about fighting, war,power...its also about love and lost. What you saw in the trial and what you thought is not what this movie about.

577,andrewleivesley-697-421069,A much stronger entry into the Avengers universe than both Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D and Iron Man 3,6,30 October 2013,"Firstly I would like to say I am a big fan of the modern day marvel films. However, I was extremely disappointed with Iron Man 3 it lost its focus half way through with one of the most ridiculously executed twists I have ever seen. Thankfully Thor:The Dark World gets these right. There are many moments throughout the film where it looks like it is set in one direction and then it completely changes course and this makes it extremely entertaining to watch. Apart from questionable performances from Anthony Hopkins (who is one my favourite actors) and Christopher Eccleston, the performances are excellent. Chris Hemsworth has never been better as the God of Thunder but it is Tom Hiddlestone's performance as Loki which steals the show. He is without doubt a joy to watch on screen and always demands attention as it is never quite clear what it is he is about to do. It is this unpredictability that undermines the true villain Malekith who is fairly weak in comparison. Now the story. The story is fairly basic; ancient evil after an evil power source which can destroy the universe etc. But it is the way in which it unfolds which is so captivating. With many fairly shocking moments which drive the story to a more darker road. This brings about my only complaint on how the actual story is told. There are several moments where the story is quite emotionally driven and these scenes are the highlights of the film. Yet after each seen they jump straight to comedy elements and it just doesn't seem natural all the time. Don't get me wrong the comedic parts are some of the best (the Captain America scene was incredibly funny) it is just too much of a drastic change. All in all this is a must watch for fans of Marvel. It is better than the first in my opinion and much better than Iron Man 3.",Thor - The Dark World
578,fairleyhlloyd,"First Was Okay, This One Was Meh",5,8 November 2013,"This film was just okay. Maybe my expectations were too high for Thor 2. I was really hoping it would improve on the first one (which was good but had so much more potential.) I saw some good reviews for this one and some bad ones, so I tried not to have my expectations up TOO high whenever I saw it on my own. Don't get me wrong--it was an enjoyable movie. It had its funny moments, many of them involving Tom Hiddleston. There was also more time spent on Asgard, and Jane finally got some more screen time. But overall, the film was average. Perhaps I was expecting more from it, but it fell down from my expectations (only slightly, as I did not love the first film but thought it was just decent). I really, really wanted to love it, but I didn't. So I guess I was disappointed in it.SPOILER ALERTThe plot of the story was mediocre. We're given a back story about the main antagonist, Malekith, and a little about Asgard and his connection to it, but it's a little incoherent. Which isn't totally bad, I guess, but Malekith's reasons for wanting to destroy Asgard just seem flat to me. He feels like your atypical I-Wanna-Destroy-Your-World type of villain, which has been done many times before.The way they make Jane get possessed by the evil source or whatever that Malekith needs felt like a forced way to have her in Asgard. She spends a lot of time passing out or cowering behind as battles wage on. It gets a little better near the end, where Jane helps Thor defeat Malekith, but overall she isn't given much to do. I don't expect her to be superman or whatever, given that she has no powers, but I wished she had been given more to do as opposed to being the victim of an evil entity. She also doesn't have enough chemistry with Thor to make me feel like they really love each other.Darcy was funny in the first film, and still was to an extent in this one, but there was times when she was annoying. She got too much screen time, and I believe that a comic relief needs less so that they remain funny and not get annoying. Her sidekick, or intern, also feels useless and is used to temporally replace Eric Selvig, who, thanks to Loki, has gone insane and does crazy antics for comic relief.As I mentioned earlier, Loki was fabulous in this film, having very funny one-lines and making smart remarks. However, his motives get a little messy in this film. It makes since that he would be a sort of shades of gray character, but when (and there's a HUGE spoiler coming up here) he is supposedly killed to sacrifice himself for Thor and then appears to be alive and wanting the throne is Asgard as Thor leaves to Earth, I'm left confused. What was the point of Loki ""sacrificing"" himself if he wanted the throne? Was he pretending to die so that no one would suspect he'd become king? Maybe that's just apart of the mystery of his plot, and I'll have to watch the next film to see. But, as a stand-alone, it's confusing.Odin is reduced to being a jerk for the sake of the plot. He shows little to no concern for Jane when Thor brings her to Asgard until he discovers what she is possessed with. He also basically tells Thor that the only difference between him and Malekith is that he ""will win"" the battle. This seems a little out of character from the Odin we met in the first film, who wanted to be a fair and strong ruler. I know why they did it-- to give Thor a reason to want to stay on Earth--but by making Odin do something that seems so rude kind of turns the audience off from his behavior.Once again, Thor's friends (Sif, Fandral, Volstagg, and Hogun) receive little screen time or anything character development in general. Fandral, Volstagg, and Hogun say little to no words in this film; a possible love triangle between Sif, Thor, and Jane is implied and then quickly gotten rid of. These characters are fun, and I really wish I got to see more of them.Some of the comic relief felt odd. For instance, Selvig is glad when Thor tells him that Loki dies but quickly offers Thor some very awkward condolences. I completely understand why he would want Loki dead--this IS the man that possessed/made Selvig go crazy, after all-but the audience is led to believe that Loki really has died. Maybe they expected us to know that he hadn't? I know that I didn't believe his death, so maybe that's why. But there were other places where the comic relief felt odd, too, mostly exchanges taking place during the battle scenes. At least they were funny.And finally, the film feels entirely too short. I get that they might not want to make it longer for budget reasons, but if that's the case then they shouldn't try and throw in character development. Some things just felt rushed, and some characters feel underdeveloped. Admittedly the length is not as bad as it was in the first film, but this is mostly because we've already gotten to know the characters and they are now being expanded on.SPOILER ENDSo that's pretty much how I feel about Thor: The Dark World. I guess it sounds like I disliked it more than I liked it, and maybe I do, but it wasn't a bad film. I'd watch it again if someone asked me to, and I'd laugh at the comical parts and still enjoy the movie. It's just one of those instances where a film is okay, or even good, but could have been better.",Thor - The Dark World
579,brandonrengert,THOR: The Dark World is definitely out of this world!,10,10 December 2013,"So this movie just blew me away. I did not expect it to be so funny. I thought that MARVEL got away with so much hilarity. But hey, the people loved it and so did I. What I loved about this movie was that you actually got to see more of Asgard and the way it was built and the details of it. The graphics were stunning and the storyline was a hit. So The Dark World is about a dark elf leader named Melakith and he strives to own this dark power to rule the planets as you would say. THOR struggles to maintain peace in the 9 realms of space and he must defeat Melakith while using his brother for help. Loki in this move was so deceiving. In the first THOR movie, we all know he was a bad guy. Then the Dark World he looks to be a brother sometimes and other times a fool and a double-crosser. I think in the movie (I didn't see it very well cause I was eating popcorn) Loki actually cuts off THOR's hand and it grows back. That part there made me feel that Loki wasn't really on THOR's side at all. But then you see Loki take his life for THOR and he actually dies. Natalie Portman had way better lines and acting in this movie. She wasn't nervous or acting all girly. She was actually slapping Loki because she was mad at him from The Avengers when he ruined New York. She actually got to see Asgard as THOR promised her from the first movie. She somehow manages to get the dark power that Melakith is looking for inside of herself and she reacts to it if people try to steal it, like Melakith.Overall, this movie was funny, hit the spot, was out of this world and they should totally make a 3rd movie!!!",Thor - The Dark World
580,olyoff,Better than the first,6,28 November 2013,"I enjoyed the first Thor and I was looking forward to the Dark World and it didn't disappoint in a sense. For one reason, I didn't go to see Thor: The Dark World for a deep movie experience but for a fun action movie. But I knew coming in what I was going to see and I had a fun time watching this movie. The movie is directed by Alan Taylor and he expands on the world of Asgard and creates great battle scenes in this movie. But the movie more or less is just another marvel action movie. The movie has its moments but certain aspects of the movie are off. For one example, Thor and Jane Fosters relationship feels somewhat forced and unnatural. And Thor's villain, Malekith, isn't very well developed and is probably one of my least favorite villains of all the Marvel movies. But Loki played by Tom Hiddleston is an excellent character and his always entertaining when on screen. But other than Loki the other characters are just more or less there to carry the story. The story isn't bad but as I've said I wish certain things were better developed. Thor: The Dark World is definitely a movie I would recommend you go see if you want to have some fun. It's action is great and this great movie to see with the family, with date, with friends, or just your self. Better than average movie but gave me thorough enjoyment through the filmVerdict:6/10 better than an average movie",Thor - The Dark World
581,zjjim,Very Funny but not a perfect one,7,8 November 2013,"Seems that Loki is so popular these days that each girl will be screaming about him when watching the movie,which makes Natalie Portman invisible and unimportant. The lines in it are very funny with great humor,visual effect is also fantastic. However,it remains a big problem that the descriptions of each role are not convincing enough for us to understand what they are thinking about or planning to do.Supporting roles show us great performances which are way better than Thor and Jane,especially for Darcy and Erik. Anyway,some incredible surprises still turn up now and then.And it is way better than the first one.You shouldn't miss those excellent moments.",Thor - The Dark World
582,chelsea-taylor-110,The unexpected journey,10,3 November 2013,Thor 2 the dark world is an amazing film full of lots of unexpected scenes in it that i am going to let you find out for yourself. The film was casted extremely well as it is a sequel to Thor. Chris Hemsworth done an excellent job as usual fitting into his character. Tom Hiddleston who plays Loki was an extremely comedic actor in this film and i found that he was naturally funny with the script given and made it his own. Natalie Portman was not you're usual super hero girlfriend that continuously gets into trouble and screams at everything she sees instead she was a very perky character and brave she got her hands dirty helping Thor with his fight. I strongly recommend this film as it has some amazing graphics in.,Thor - The Dark World
583,eunvin-h,"All Loki, no Thor.",5,6 February 2014,"I would give this 5.5. In fact, I am surprised by this high rating in IMDb, which I have been (and am) often using as a reference before watching any movie. Here, I come here to review this with no perfect English and shallow knowledge on movies. What I want to say is that this isn't worth watching. I watched this merely as a fan of the ""Thor(2011)"" (Seriously, Thor: The Dark World a 7.7 rating???). In comparison to the previous one which nicely introduced the character of Thor and the charming villain Loki, I don't see anything in here. There are only fighting, nice graphics, with no real substance (I truly agree to Viktor Cicvara's review) to draw the audience into the story line. Such one-dimensional characters and full-of-coincidence story. Only made me a fan of Loki, who wasn't the main character of the plot. Nice CG work, but worth no watch. -------Complete Spoiler only for those who are not willing to watch this film, yet curious or who doesn't care about spoilers---Suddenly, Jane gets dragged in (really out of nowhere) and soaks in a tremendous power that will destroy the world. Thor takes her to Asgard. The dark elves awakes after a millennium of time (maybe because the power have come out into the world as they waited. For a millennium!!!). Attacks Asgard and gets rid of its defense system so easily as if they could always have done it (with a little guidance of Loki). Kills the queen and run away because of Thor (so powerful to scare them off and hurt them). With the defense down, Asgard in danger. The King says that Asgard will fight back, Thor accuses him for being cruel...? As they cannot win the enemy, Thor decides to give them ""power"" and easily kill them (What a plan to save Asgard). Just as expected, the power is given and the whole nine realms in danger. What is surprising is that the once-mighty Thor cannot suddenly beat a single subordinate who he have already scared off. Loki gets killed saving Thor. Thor angry. Thor go earth. Jane know where the nine realms collide, which should happen every 5,000 years and happen to be soon. Thor fight the dark elf very well, win. (Goes in and out of universes so many time.) Thor return. The King of Asgard complements him, saying he's the true king (What a nice plan he has completed.). Thor rejects to be in a dehumanizing position. Turns out that Loki wasn't dead and acts to be the King via illusion. Loki prevails.",Thor - The Dark World
584,thevocalcoach,Good!,7,19 November 2013,"I actually liked the first Thor movie better, but that could be because when I saw the first movie it was in a huge theatre and we got to watch it in 3D which for movies like this adds a lot to the experience. It was great seeing the characters back, there is a lot of good funny moments to go with some really good action scenes. I'm not a huge fan of the comic book character of Thor so I obviously prefer other movies about super heroes but it's still pretty good. I went into the first one with low expectations and really enjoyed that movie a lot, this one I had higher expectations and maybe that's why I thought the movie was really good but not quite great. I would see another Thor movie if and when it comes out, fun and worth seeing for sure, fan of these movies or no you will find stuff to enjoy in them.",Thor - The Dark World

Question circulating in my head was what kind of people did give this rating different than 1. It is a disaster I cannot even explain, horrific play and scenario, won't even talk about the interpretation of the Scandic mythology as whoever has seen the first one knows its done by people with no sense of it at all. Indeed, this thing is a serious offense against the culture of the Scandinavians.In a few words, it reminds me of a cheap Hercules style series, looks like the budget has been $14, 189.67 in total, is made by people with no sense of mythology and is totally disastrous. Worst 8 euro I have ever spent in my life, worst by far. Movie deserves a parody. Cries for one.",Thor - The Dark World
586,haraldfriedchicken,"Very enjoyable, but not flawless",7,8 February 2019,"This is certainly not a movie without some questionable parts. We have the standard bad guy who doesn't really have much motivation other than to consume everything in darkness because... well, evil?The great positives of this movie are firstly... surprise surprise, Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Certainly my favorite part of both the first Thor movie and The Avengers, he's still fantastic in this movie. At one point his one-liners became rather tiresome, but for the most part in this movie, he's a greatly enjoyable character with the greatest character arc.
Secondly, Asgard is still just as beautiful as in the first Thor movie, if not even more beautiful. Tons of great VFX work throughout this movie makes it look gorgeous, I bought the blu-ray for this movie for the visual aspect alone.Some negative parts of the film would be firstly as mentioned before, the ""bad guy"" who carry as much depth as a kiddy pool. The script overall feels a bit ""meh""... with some poor dialogue throughout. Direction is also a tad messy and you can expect this whole ""9 universes"" thing to make up some confusing and messy scenes.I must admit that I was afraid a huge triangle-drama would occur when Jane and Thor's female warrior buddy, Sif exchanged looks, clearly indicating Sif's jealousy towards Jane. Luckily, they never went further on this.To conclude...
Enjoyable movie with great visual effects and most importantly, Loki.
Some negatives can be found, but overall I consider this to be among the better Marvel movies.",Thor - The Dark World

Instead, along comes this endless battle royal that goes on and on and on with sword fights and battle scenes. Not to mention the all too typical these days - cars getting tossed around like swatted flies scenes that made me wonder if this was supposed to be a Transformers remake or a Tolkien version of a Rambo movie or something. I was expecting a SUPER-HERO movie, not a war movie. At the start the movie seems promising but as it goes on it becomes painfully obvious that little was invested towards writing an interesting plot line and script for this stinker. Evil elves versus Azgardians? Give me a break! Maybe if they make a third movie they can pit Thor against an evil villain here on Earth and the earthlings can be more than minor window dressing in the plot line.

Once more, the viewers are left in the dark (pun intended) when trying to understand Thor's dimensions, parallel universes, worlds, and how to travel between them. There are plenty of action scenes,and -- differently than other super hero movies -- there's comic relief during the fights so we are not actually bored for 15 minutes as the hero and villain ultimately destroy a city (cough cough Man of Steel); which is good.The acting is fine, but not superb. I will point out to Kat Dennings as a bright spot, and Loki is always an enjoyable character.Other than that, the directing is not original, the plot repetitive, and the actors not that exciting.But, if in comparison to other super hero movies of nowadays, this one fares above the average.

Malakith seems like a mere target practice for Thor even while super powerful. He will never ever strike you as a really dangerous bad guy...and that's because he isn't. His soldier Kurse seems to be more bad-ass than him. Such a waste of a bad guy.The second bad thing is Loki. Yeah I know, people say that he is the best part...well he's both actually. Brilliant at times but severely overused. He makes the movie interesting but it gets annoying when you see that his side-story outshines the main ""universe destroyer"" by a mile.Third part are the funny scenes and humor. It's good to have silly jokes here and there but there are SO MANY in this movie that you can't really take anything seriously. Darcy character should be funny but It really and utterly IS NOT.

596,tyson-choi,Good film - i liked it,6,8 March 2021,"I'm not a big MCU fan unfortunately.But I like Thor. The film has many great qualities. The effects are amazing.The effects in the first film were already great, but this film ups the ante. The effects are twice or even three times better than the first film, as is the world building. This film showcases more of the nine realms, and also fleshes out Asghard better than the last film did.The film spends more time in Asghard and in the Dark Elves' home world than on Earth which I was okay with. I did not dislike the time spent on Earth like many people did, but I just found the scenes on Asghard and the Ice Realm to be more interesting and fun. Lastly the action scenes are greatly entertaining, especially the Loki prison break scene. The action is another thing that is upped in this film. I also love the design of the Dark Elves. I also like the technology employed by both the Dark Elves and Asghard. This film does a better job at showcasing the technology and mythology of these different realms.However, where this film excelled in action and effects, it unfortunately drops the ball when it comes to character. There is really no character development in this show. Thor is now a wise leader that puts other first. Other than having to defeat the bad guy there is no conflict he has to deal with, and he does not change or grow. Granted, I would rather have a character remain static than regress and forget the lessons they learn from the previous film like in the Iron Man sequels. However, I would like some form of development for the characters, especially the main ones, but we really do not get that.Thor, as well as the other main characters are still likable and they never irritated me, but I felt that their characters never went anywhere.Solid 6+",Thor - The Dark World

599,gorangogo,This movie is absolute garbage.,2,16 November 2013,"Let me start off by saying I had fairly high expectations for this film, not only being a fan of the first film but of Thor as a comic book characters. To be nice, these expectations were not met. To be realistic, this is easily the worst of the Marvel movies. This is my first review so sorry if I jump around a lot with what I say. Let's begin with the characters. Thor was.. okay. He said nor did anything noteworthy really. He didn't grow that much as a character, and simply felt boring. Natalie Portman was horribly boring to watch, and in some scenes her character was written as an idiot. That seems to be a common problem with the movie. Jane Foster? An idiot. Eric Selvig, an originally intelligent character that had some serious, good talks with Thor? Running around naked because the Tesseract made him go insane... or something. It wasn't very clear. Speaking of, if he went insane because of the Tesseract, why was Hawkeye completely okay after a bonk on the head? Darcy? The most annoying girl on the planet. She was meant for comedy but came of as GRATING to listen to and watch. Odin was a douche who didn't know how to rule properly. Malekith was just... boring. The makers had so much to work with, considering in the comics what a clever sorcerer he is, as well as a deranged homicidal madman. In this movie his motivations are unclear and his only character trait was he likes to frown at things with his puffy looking face. Character wise the only saving graces were Idris Elba as Heimdall and Tom Hiddleston as Loki, which did not matter much considering how little they were in the movie. Which is strange because Loki is in the trailer so much, but has MAYBE 20 minutes of screen time. The special effects in this movie were just ugly. Every monster looked fake and many of the scenes looked like they were pulled out of a last gen video game. the set design was okay, but not once did I feel immersed. Everything felt like a flimsy set. It was just an ugly movie to look at. The plot was just all over the place, with cuts to different scenes happening frequently. Many scenes were completely useless could have been cut altogether. Literally the only good scene was when Loki and Thor trick Malekith. Also, considering it was never explained how Loki was able to survive a stab wound, switch places with a guard, then switch places with Odin becoming the new leader of Asgard, the ending makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The dialogue was just... horrendous. There were multiple points where myself and the people I've seen the movie with just laughed at the ridiculousness of what was being said. Speaking of, the movie was farrrrrr too funny. Don't get me wrong, I like comedic relief in these Marvel movies, it works for the established universe but GOD they literally play every scene for comedy it seems. Even the final world ending battle with Malekith was played for comedy. For Christ's sake, THOR RODE TO THE BATTLE IN A SUBWAY CAR. There's a gag where him and Malekith are sliding on the side of a building with office people looking outside blankly, completely meant for comedy.. IN THE FINAL, WORLD ENDING BATTLE. Avengers, Thor, Iron Man 1,2 Captain America, all these movies had the common sense to put the comedy in scenes where it was necessary. Hell, even Iron Man 3, the most comedic movie behind this one had the common sense to say ""This is the final battle. Let's make this badass"". Another problem with the final battle itself is that it has no 'WOW' moments. There's no real climax, everything is just bleh. OH and Malekith is squished by his spaceship. That's something. Oh and why the hell do Asgardians and Dark Elves have so many technological based things?! They have star ships, turrets, laser cannons, ray guns, etc. There's nothing here that feels like magic, which is what Thor should be about. And the Aether. The main point of the movie. The weapon to spread darkness throughout the universe essentially ushering an era of rule under Malekith. I couldn't tell you a damn thing about this thing other that it spread... darkness. whatever that means. The concepts that this movie is trying to give are incredibly under explained. Where did the Aether come from? Not explained. How did Jane end up actually finding it? Not sure. What's the Convergence? It's when the 9 realms line up so Malekith can... spread... darkness?.. How powerful is it? I have no idea. Apparently universe shattering, but Thor doesn't have much trouble fighting an Aether powered Malekith. It's actually kind of sad how easily he was dispatched. There is little fun to be had in this movie. It's just stupid. I didn't care about a single character besides Loki, who was actually somewhat developed and easily stole the show when he was on screen. This movie is absolute garbage and has ruined Thor cinematically for me. I truly hope Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy are good or I truly worry for the Avenegers 2. Please save your money. Don't see this movie. Don't tell the studios that this Transformers 2 level garbage is okay to put out, that these characters are okay to ruin. In the end, I give this movie a 2 out of 10, because Idris Elba was good, Loki was fantastic, and it had a single scene in the movie where it gave me a glimmer of hope that it would be redeemed. I'm sure I have far more to address but I'm trying really hard to forget this film and reread the latest Thor comic epic, Gorr the God Butcher. If you want to see some good Thor, read that rather than watching this. Please.",Thor - The Dark World
600,rterenzini,Thor faces off with some angry elves.,9,9 November 2013,"The word that most comes to mind when describing Thor: The Dark World, is IMPRESSIVE! This second independent Thor film in no way disappoints and in my opinion is only topped by The Avengers in likability. The sheer scope of the movie is awesome. We see a lot more of Asgard and get to bounce around to a few of the Nine Realms for a very enjoyable ride. Director, Alan Taylor does a phenomenal job balancing the action (and there is a lot), the drama, and the humor in this film. There are some genuinely touching scenes in this film, something that Marvel, overall, has done a good job with in the Avengers based films.The basic plot involves some pretty nasty Dark Elves and their desire to unleash some cosmic badness, effectively ending the universe as we know it. These elves are tough hombres. They have stealth ships and weapons powerful enough to cause Asgard and our heroes some real problems. But the heart of the film lies in the relationship between Thor, again played perfectly by Chris Hemsworth, and his mischievous brother, Loki, who Tom Hiddleston has made my favorite villain. The best moments are between these two. I won't throw out any spoilers, but I will say that Loki is spectacular.Natalie Portman is back as Jane Foster, Thor's love interest, as is Stellan Skarsgård, who is very fun to watch as Erik Selvig, the slightly off astrophysicist. Anthony Hopkins, puts in another turn as Odin, Thor's old man and conveys a tiredness of the old king as he once again faces war with an old enemy.See this film in the theater.

601,Rayjin,"Thor 2 > Thor 1 - But is it still a good film, worth to watch?",6,1 November 2013,"I'm a really big fan of superheroes, I've read many comics and I've watched nearly every film, which is based on a superheroe comic. Thor - The Dark World is far better than the previous Thor but I have to admit that the sequel wasn't worth to watch in the cinema, on the release date. Even though we can see a film, which offers you far more action than the forerunner, you can't overlook the fact that Marvel-Studios has created this film. During the first 40 minutes I've experienced an immense entertainment because the director Alan Taylor was really successful at creating a great atmosphere, the plot was taken really seriously, because it didn't contain any of these typical small jokes which normally appear during a Marvel-film. In addition there were a lot of mistakes considering the logic of the plot. After the first part the film became more and more atrocious, especially in the end. I will give ""Thor-The Dark World"" 6 out of 10 points because the film offered me more entertainment than the forerunner but if it was only for the first part, I would give 9 out of 10 points.",Thor - The Dark World
602,vanessaparra12,Marvel Did It Again!,10,8 November 2013,"I always go to every Marvel midnight premiere and I was really excited since Iron Man 3 was a bit disappointing. I was never a big fan of Thor when I saw the first movie but what really made me a fan was when i saw The Avengers. I was still a bit skeptical but after the first 30 min i was hooked. It was a rollarcoaster of action, drama, and a few laughs. It was so much fun watching this movie even though i just watched in 2D but i will definitely go see it again in Imax 3D. Loki is my favorite villain in the Marvel world I love him! Every scene with Loki was wonderful! Man hes a sick bastard but i love it. I know who I'm dressing up as next year at Comic Con ;) I strongly recommend seeing Thor the Dark World its great for the whole family and the crazy nerd like myself. IN THE NAME OF ASGARD I GIVE THY MOVIE A 10!",Thor - The Dark World
603,abuwaquase,Great Entertainment,10,10 November 2013,"Thor 2 ""The Dark World"" gives great entertainment movie. Both the parts of the series of Thor gives full entertainment, and full of enjoyment. It is one of the best sequel I watched. The theme and concept of the movie is very perfect and is best suitable. Thanks to the Marvel gives much entertainer movie.All the characters played in this movie is so perfect. Specially i like the character of Loki played by Tom Hiddleston.Overall This movie is great entertainer movie with lots of actions with excellent graphics.I give it 10/10.",Thor - The Dark World
604,jpr-852-246178,Good,7,24 November 2013,"This is a very enjoyable movie best seen on the big screen so see it while you can.The cast and characters are really good with them being very entertaining in their parts.There is great action but also great comedy at times and the balance between the two is very good.The special effects are obviously very good as well this being a Marvel summer blockbuster. Better than the first Thor I think, but I like the first movie better overall as far as the stories go, the rest is about even.Be sure to stick around after the movie too because during the credits and after the credits there are extra little scenes that you will enjoy. And there will definitely be more sequels to this movie, for sure.",Thor - The Dark World
605,ratemymovietoday,Superfun !,8,5 December 2013,"The thing that pleased me most is that this movie is so much fun to watch, which is in fact an irony given its name. The first Thor (2011) contained darker and serious themes concerning father son relationship, betrayal and in some places was painfully slow to watch. But this time, its gun blazing from the first scene and the pace remained consistent till the end credits !The best part of the film is that the writers/directors avoided the mistakes which they usually do while making a sequel to a hit movie.They tend to make story lines nostalgic and repeated, put in huge amounts of cash (which is not bad though :P) and try so hard in making the sequel perfect that the movie becomes bland and losses all its sheen in the process. One classic example is Speed -2. But thats not the case in Thor 2013. Storyline is kept basic but still entertaining, dialogs bit clichéd but not cheesy and action scenes were better and bigger but not confusing and complex (a la Transformers where you can't even track who is getting thrashed by whom!).All the major characters returned from the first film and each one performed up to expectations, Thor is more sleek, Jane is more charming, Erik more mad... but to me, the real star of the movie is Loki ! he somehow makes a scene more fun and engaging. Loki has risen in stature this time, especially after the events in New York. Everybody knows that he is shrewd and opportunistic but now he somehow gains a mystical respect which nobody shows but everybody feels for him, even the audience !This time, Thor has to not only save Asgard or Earth but the whole universe and the only person who can help him in his fight against the dark forces is Loki himself. The dynamics of brotherly love are evident between them but they still are enemies and this weird equation creates an exciting chemistry between the two.Watch this movie to see why sometimes saving universe can be fun !",Thor - The Dark World
606,kemalberk,Loki I love you son.,9,7 February 2014,"Great movie for every age.Very good action scenes and good acting.Especially Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston they were amazing.Just Thor,the son of Odin,can save the world against Dark elf's.Looks like ordinary and similar to first movie but it didn't same because Malekith is very powerful than Loki and it makes movie more exciting and different.Scenes with Loki and Erik Selvig were funny and new.The end of the movie Loki became king of Asgard and Thor turn to his love Jane foster.What a ending..Even now I feel exciting about new movie.I always love Marvel's heroes and movies but sometimes they droll about scenario for example last Wolverine movie was terrible and boring but this movie was exciting and fluent.Chris Hemsworth is excellent in every role.In my opinion Loki need own movie it can be very funny.This movie deserve nine points from me.",Thor - The Dark World
607,taylorwongfans,Meh,7,10 June 2014,"It is a good movie,lots of cool action and great special effects. I find the story slightly weak but that may be just me. This movie is filled with talented actors but the dialog and script aren't exactly the best. I felt it was a bit cheesy at times, especially with the convergence mumbo jumbo, but again that is just my opinion. I think everyone just watched this movie for Loki but he seemed like a big plot hole in the end. If you have some time to kill this movie will do it for you, it's not bad but I don't think it's that great either, if you really want to see a good movie,find another Marvel movie like Avengers or the new Xmen to watch it will be much better!",Thor - The Dark World

It has a highly similar scene and concept.2. Dark Elves' s spaceship clashes into the palace of Ascard to assault >>> 99% similar animated scenes you can find on the trailer of star Wars videos game, The Old Republic(2011), which Siths' s spaceship clashes into Jedi's Temple to assault.3.

609,spudhead_12,"A 2 hour set up for Ragnarok, which is a 2 hour set up for Infinity Wars which is...",6,5 September 2016,"Gosh, how many films to set us up for the future Marvel films? And Marvel hold our attention and live up to the expectation?The films enjoyable. And as a set up it works, I'm certainly excited to see what the future films have in store. But in this elaborate set up, we've completely lost the plot. You will ultimately watch this film and go ""Wait, what happened again?"" But it's better that way, because to re watch and this time focus on the actual plot, rather than the side story set up, is to be sorely disappointed. **SPOILERS** So the plot goes that some dark elves used to once rule the realms, and had it snatched off them in the final moment. They're leader kills the majority of his civilians to try again 5000 years later. He doesn't mind waiting. All he needs is an event called the convergence and a magical all powerful ether. It's super powerful. The convergence is coming and Jane Foster stumbles on the ether, waking the dark elves so they can kick arse in Asgard, in scenes that very much look like Star Wars. Conveniently, it seems that, despite kicking butt earlier in the film, once they get the Ether, they actually suck. Like, really suck. And the world is saved by 4 humans, 1 of which is mad the other 2 complete idiots, running around with sticks and Thor - a mind-numbing boring superhero. Which is a relief I guess, for Earth anyway. But doesn't exactly make any sense. So watch and enjoy Loki (Tom Hiddleson) completely steal the limelight to distract you from what really would be a bad film otherwise.",Thor - The Dark World
610,jasenm5,It's Hammer Time!,8,6 November 2013,"I'm one of the few nerds in this world who wasn't terribly impressed by the first Thor movie. I didn't hate it. I didn't even really dislike it. It was a movie that was just there. A one word rating for it would be meh. When Avengers came out I was pleasantly surprised by how much more entertaining the Thor and Loki characters were. They started to grow on me. While I'm not quite sold on Thor as a stand-alone super hero, I love Loki as a stand-alone villain. I'm going to say it right now and save you some trouble; this movie is very much worth your money! If you stuck around after that last statement, instead of just going out and throwing your money at some teenager with a poor complexion, then let me tell you why this movie is so great. It really breaks down two three things. The first is the Amazing visual effects. Thor: The Dark World is much more in the production style of Avengers, than the first Thor. It had big ambition, big talent, and an even bigger budget. These amazing VFX are only highlighted by some great cinematography, and amazing locations. Iceland (as an alien planet) was the most amazing of them all. The second was the story line. Thor: The Dark World focuses on an agent race of evil elves that are in search of a substance that can destroy all nine realms by throwing them into eternal darkness. While the elves were goofy looking, they made for a formidable foe. I won't lie, the script won't win any awards (except maybe something goofy like an MTV movie award), but it's fun! Fun counts for a lot. The third and final aspect that made this film so great was Tom Hiddleston. The man who plays Loki is an amazing actor, and portrays villianry at near Tim Curry levels. Hiddleston has an amazing career in front of him. Go see ""Thor: The Dark World,"" wait through the credits (there's two stingers), and enjoy the large amounts of fun that is the Marvel universe. You wont regret it, and you'll be prepared for the next Avengers movie. http://watchplayread.com/thor-dark-world-worth-money/",Thor - The Dark World
611,jacoblegobatman,Thor: The Yawn Film,4,22 September 2018,"This movie... I'm starting to think this, and Iron Man 3, were written poorly because Avengers made so much money. So the writers just though ""If these films bombed it won't matter."" And boy did they bomb. And if they did bomb, we probably have gotten Phase 3. But thanks to Winter Solder and Guardians we did. Now back to... this thing.Okay lets talk about the positives in this movie. Loki. That's it. Loki is the best part about this film. Tom Hiddleston puts his all into this and again he's awesome. Wish I could say the same for the rest.Lets talk about the biggest problem with this movie. Asgard. Asgard is the most boring place in the MCU. It looks like dull and is so boring. With Ragnarok they didn't spend too much time there. Here we spend about a quarter there. In fact the whole movie looks dull. Everything takes a Fan4stic/ Suicide Squad look. Just because you make everything dark, doesn't mean you're brilliant. The humour is also boring. I give the first movie credit that it did have a good once in a while. Here, its like trying to find humour in Schindler's List. Its so dull. And the villain... People have said how terrible most of the MCU villains are - minus Loki- and yeah they are right. But even with the worse ones you member them. Even with the worse ones you can remember their appearance. Here, who cares who the villain was, the movies over. The climax is probably the biggest issue with this film. The idea of it is brilliant. Portals to other dimensions can lead to who knows how many ideas. But no. We stay in Grey Britain. No wonder it took them 4 years to make another Thor film. That was goodIn the end this film should have been called: Thor: The Dull World.",Thor - The Dark World

There's some spaceship battles straight out of the Star Wars prequels as well.Apart from some nice visuals and some decent fights, a couple of cool cameos and some funny moments, this one fell flat for me and poor in comparison to the first.It was only when the battle came to Earth that things got interesting, I think prior to that there may have been too many CGI backgrounds and special effect fights which made me switch off.

In truth it could've been 20min longer but I liked it. People love to complain about this movie *SPOILER* (DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS FILM) The reason Thor and many others shift through one realm into the next is due to a Once in 5,000 Years event called The Convergence, where all Nine Realms line up, causing energy and matter to be able to pass realm to realm as though through a door. Some people can't grasp this and therefore, due to their sloping foreheads, will never grasp this concept. When asked, ""what is your favorite Marvel Film Franchise (?), a noted physicist said Thor 1 & 2, because of how true these events actually are being considered in the real world. (Wormholes, etc.) But back to the film. This is great. Im seeing people say They hate this but loved Avengers, or vice versa. This is ludicrous. Say you don't like Thor, fine. I have no issue with personal taste. All I'll say to sum up my feelings are, working at a comic shop, reading Thor all my life, this is a great story with great banter and action.

(aka the soul of a movie) well this movie had no soul in fact when i left i felt mine died a little, this made me kinda sad but i got a frozen coke on the way out so that made me feel better for a little while i guess. Anyway i thought we were going to see the characters develop more but i was wrong again and man i hate it when i'm wrong 16 times in one day, I felt nothing for them i didn't even care for any of them and that bothers me a lot when you go to see a movie like this and you don't care? something is wrong and or missing.4) The Humor! A lot of people are talking about this both bad and good but i can't comment cause i didn't see nor hear any humor.5) Reaction from the Audience! Like watching a movie with friends when you reacted together in the same way for example laugh at something amusing it makes the movie more enjoyable, non existent in my theater of about 12 or so but still you would expect something like a laugh, a giggle or gasping but well you already know what i'm going to say.In conclusion this is my first time submitting a review for a movie and to be bothered so much by a movie to then write one has to mean something, It just seems like movies these days are lacking in heart they just want to pump these out without putting heart in them and that makes me sad... sad enough that now i have to go watch friends to cheer me up.Thank you for reading and remember these are just my thoughts and opinions by all means if you want to see it please do and form your own thoughts on the experience and i hope you enjoyed reading.",Thor - The Dark World

I had to go and see it again and again it was just so absorbing, humorous and intriguing. Once again, with no surprise, Tom Hiddleston's performance was amazing. Every time he was on screen I was either laughing or crying. The brotherly bond between Thor and Loki was touching, hilarious and emotional at times. Chris and Tom work so well together, their constant banter as Thor and Loki had the whole cinema cracking up laughing. Kat Dennings, she would have to be another star of the movie as Darcy Lewis, despite the fact that she's not one of the leading characters, she is sarcastic, witty and absolutely hilarious every time she was in view, along with the help of her new intern, 'Ian.'The plot was easy to follow, and you didn't want it to end! Especially after watching the Avengers and the previous Thor movie another thousand times before this one. Definitely a good watch! Humor, love, tragedy and so much more drama. Witness the return of Jane Foster, Thor Odinson, Darcy Lewis, Loki Laufeyson, Erik Selvig and his pants! Don't miss this amazing film.",Thor - The Dark World
619,nheger,"Hated it at first, loved it the second time",8,22 April 2017,"I first watched this movie when it came out, with great expectations. I found it to be a total mess and would probably have given it 2 stars. Re-watching it now, years later with no expectations, I loved it. It wasn't flawless, and certainly the main bad guy had no screen time and so some potential drama was lost with him. But the movie isn't just about the main bad guy - Loki was at his most brilliant, funny, and deceiving, as he should be. Thor was being Thor, which is in itself epic. There was some real loss, some real emotion for these characters, there was a lot of Asgard and Asgardians - all in all entertaining.Why do I like it so much better now? I think because I now understand both the storyline, with all the little side plots, and also the context of the infinity stones. If one is unfamiliar with the Marvel universe, then one would miss the side plots and developments that happen outside the main plot line, and the movie would indeed be very one-dimensional. So I guess this one's for the insiders or people who re-watch it. Loved it on the second watch.",Thor - The Dark World

The plot was to complicated (a bit like Stark Trek movies) for the ordinary person and failed to wrap the viewer in the movie like we were in the Avengers and Iron Man. It did entertained us Marvel fan but not my wife who was looking at the watch 30minutes into the movie (though she did like the avengers). I mean, Superman is a difficult character to bring down to earth and humanize but the last movie accomplished just that, shame they couldn't do the same for this sci-fi Thor movie.

While I thought the first Thor movie was the worst of the first wave of Marvel movies, I went into this one with high hopes. But within the first five minutes of the movie I was bored out of my mind. Throughout the entire movie NOTHING happens. They spend the entire movie talking about doing something, or talking about things they did off screen. Even the action scenes were incredibly boring. they just bounced around from punch to punch. Nothing really ever gets resolved. Then there's the writing. The characters are very one dimensional. There dialog was very unrealistic. I mean, no one talks like they do in this movie. And there is absolutely no character development, the characters end the movie exactly where they started! Then there's the villain. I love Eccleston. But they didn't give him anything to do. He simply walks on screen, looks at something, then walks off. He's BORING! Just like everything else in this movie. All this movie is capable of is beating you over the head with all of the pretty lights. And while the movie is gorgeous.

But don't forget about Loki which i think has his own attractive side. Thor won't be Thor without Loki.

The movie however does what it is meant to do - i.e. entertain. Don't go looking for logic, questioning at times that if Thor can fly, then why does he need to take a subway or a taxi. Natalie Portman is given her due share of screen time.The build-up to the story is good, better than some of the recent superhero movies, and the special effects give a lot of life to the movie during the first hour. Performances are quite decent. Loki stands out and maintains is stature as someone who can constantly surprise you.What really disappointed me was the way Thor saved the nine realms. He did something that worked (had to obviously as he is the superhero). I am not even sure if the writers and director were sure about the logic that was used for defeating the dark side. Honestly, I think it could have been a good movie if they could get the end right, but the movie still meets the purpose, which is thrill, entertain and dazzle, and then forget once the movie is over.",Thor - The Dark World

The actions scenes are better, the plot is better and there is great banter throughout the film. Due to these factors it is entertaining and has more than enough in it to keep you interested. The acting is fantastic, especial by Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, as they work great together and appear to have a great understanding of each others roles. I just can't understand why people don't like this film unless they are not a fan of superheroes. After seeing this film last night I read through a few of the reviews afterwards and was shocked as some people were giving it lower than 7. These people are clearly boring and have no idea about an entertaining film and enjoy watching films that just depress you and have no idea about what a fantastic superhero film this is. I recommend you watch this immediately as you won't be disappointed.",Thor - The Dark World
630,jmacsporran,A different direction for the not a God of Thunder,6,9 November 2013,"Welcome to a review of Thor 2.First, I did enjoy this film, I have seen it twice, with two different groups of people, the first being with a group of friends who are long time Marvel fans, both in the comics and in the movies. The second was with the girlfriend. In both experiences the film was enjoyed by me, but sadly I believe it lacked the quality in direction that was shown in the first film, and it is probably due to the loss of the original director.Yes there is a lot of action in this film, maybe there is technically more in this than in the first film. However, the action from the first film appear to be more memorable as it was correctly paced, with the right balance of humour and action (and plot).The opinion of this was shared by my Marvel die hard friends, but maybe the opinion of my girlfriend is what the balance was aimed for as she absolutely loved it due to the love story between Thor and Jane being a more central pillar of the story this time around.So what can I say about the acting. It was very well acted with Loki definitely once again being the star of the show. Thor was well acted and I have grown to love Hemsworth, but sadly Portman did not seem to want to be in this film and it showed. All the scenes involving her, from the scenes in London to the home world of the Dark Elves just felt wrong. This lack of connection meant I could not root for her and Thor and throughout the film I really did want Malekith just to kill her already and create a new story arc for Thor...hopefully with Lady Sif.The plot was good, not well paced as the original and at some points seemed off. Possibly due to the forced moments of humour inserted but also as if they decided on the plot as they directed the film.**Spoilers** There was no real explanation on why the loss of the Bifrost lead to the rebellion and wars of the Nine Realms, I guess we are just meant to accept it happening. The plot of the Aether plods a long, slowly revealing itself, but we never see why it causes the end of the world, some small explanation of conversion of everything in dark matter. There are also too many unanswered questions as the fate of the Warriors 4 and Lady Sif following their traitorous act.MAJOR SPOILER and sadly the plot surrounding Loki usurping the throne from Odin is not fully explained as how it happened, just a cliffhanger for cliffhanger sake, and this is caused due to the poor editing. So at what point did the Asgardian scout arrive? How did the real Loki manage to stab the Kursed, escape and not get stabbed? As far as I am aware an illusion was meant to be insubstantial.I would regard this as a good film, but considering the standard of Marvel second films I was a little disappointed. Usually Marvel has shown the second to exceed the first. As shown by Spiderman 2, X men 2, Iron Man 2. But sadly this might be the new standard following the slight degradation of the second sequels we have had this year.Note, stay after the trailers, there are 2 end scenes. Sadly there is no Nick Fury this time, which was disappointing, but one scene is for the lovers out there involving Thor and Jane. But this fan is definitely wanting a Thor and Sif storyline.",Thor - The Dark World
631,IoneVi,"Entertaining, but not without flaws",6,31 October 2013,"The opening scenes of Thor:TDW were promising and left me and my sister very excited! However as soon as those were over the movie started rather slowly and took too long to get on track. I felt like quite some time was wasted on comic relief and attempting to explain unnecessary things, instead of character development and the much needed spotlight on the motivation behind certain characters. This made the movie a little bit boring in some scenes and prevented before mentioned characters from truly flourishing, which is a pity. Thankfully the pacing went up a notch after the first act. The movie ended the best way possible and left me hyped for the upcoming MCU movies.I liked the villains. However, where the main villain was quite menacing in some scenes, I do think he was equally unimpressive in other scenes. Chris Hemsworth as Thor was good, although I wished the screenwriters had given him better lines and the director would push him to show more emotion in some scenes. As much as I like Chris, I do think his performance in Rush was better than here. I also wished that Thor's inner struggles were fleshed out a bit more. Tom Hiddleston as Loki was flawless, and without a doubt Loki stole the show in every scene he was in. Loki got nice character development in this movie, and when I look at his journey from Thor to the Avengers to this movie, I think the directors and Hiddleston did a great job with the character.Overall I liked this movie, so my rating would be 7.5/10",Thor - The Dark World
632,vrmubaiwa,Thor - costume design,5,20 November 2013,"The costume design was excellent. I would have loved for Thor to be a little more buff.I totally agree with this review I read on another site 'At the beginning of the film there's a battle that could fit in a ""Lord of the Rings"" film, and the costumes and Asgardian culture have a medieval influence. However, you also can see very futuristic spaceships darting through the skies, and there's a great action sequence that features a fight between Thor and Malekith where the characters are jumping through portals between worlds almost faster than you can keep track'",Thor - The Dark World
633,guardians-lucknow,How to ruin a weekend ? answer is Thor: The Dark world,2,13 November 2013,"Thor: the dark world drags you in to complete darkness, you will find not a single reason why the makers have made this film, no matter how much you juggle your Head. The story starts with history lessons about Thor's grandfather. You will never see him again for a single second in the whole movie. And the point was to create an enemy who is enormously strong but hiding out for centuries, another senseless thing. Well Loki is in prison and became a ""Family Guy""!! Is it possible ? Natalie Portman is in danger and she is not safe even in Asgard. Thor's entire contribution was to save the girlfriend and leave the people on their own. Things are happening on earth too, Erik Selvig runs without cloths not wears his pants, I don't know what was the reason behind that. Chis Hemsworth has done a terrible job, Tom Hiddelston over shadowed everyone else through his spectacular performance. Idris Elba and Anthony Hopkins are as good as they are. Action sequences has nothing new and quite boring at some places. Vfx and special effects are too heavy for this plot. Background sound is terrible and film's biggest drawback.You can watch Thor 2 only under one condition, You are a die hard fan of LOKI. All my 2 stars are for Tom Hiddelston.",Thor - The Dark World

My Dad is not a fan of superhero movies but he really enjoyed this and was totally surprised and pleased with the incredible quality and intelligence of it.Has a perfect balance of action and intelligent dialogue, the serious with humour, the celestial with family. A wonderful addition to the Marvel film universe and my favourite so far. A must see for anyone who wants to see a quality film you can watch and enjoy again and again.You can really tell just how much hard work and effort has been put into this film to make it the best it can be thought the whole of the film. The story is gripping and well told, the dialogue in every scene whether serious or funny is wonderful, the acting is superb, all the characters are interesting, believable and compelling. The locations and are just stunning! I can not praise this film enough, a must see film!!!",Thor - The Dark World
635,curt9733-895-553291,Hollywood gets your $ again,1,10 February 2014,"I studied the convergence for 25 minutes. This movie gets high ratings for the same reason that The Hobbit does: people love to see great effects that are neato, and rumbling sounds. One more sign of crumbling intelligence in a crumbling society. Most of the great movies have no special effects whatsoever. Few of them come from modern day Hollywood. Save your time and pick your nose in the bathroom at home. Crap, I don't have enough lines. I can't figure out how to write a long review about something as vapid as this movie. If you liked ""Android Cop, ""I, Frankenstein"" or ""After Earth,"" then you will love this one. I took my son to this and 25 minutes in I told him I would buy him a toy at Walmart if we could leave. The total price for the evening was $15 for the movie + $45 for the LEGO set = $60. However, he got a new toy and I didn't have to watch that crap movie.",Thor - The Dark World

I say this despite not being able to leave a critical review but an opinion is an opinion whether or not it is an informed one so they all count, both the good and the bad. I think the movie got a raw deal with all the other big movies that came out afterwards or maybe it just did not fit peoples tastes even it was a good movie . I don't understand why people are hyping Loki, yes the actor that played the part did an excellent job but the actor that play Thor also did an excellent job in how he portrayed the title character . I can't honestly see anyone else as Thor. I liked nearly the entire story the movie told and I did not find the villain to be as lacking as has been claimed by some, I just accepted him for who he was. The villain make have had a different personality to differentiate him from his counter part in the marvel comics.",Thor - The Dark World
637,brynnmac-978-576634,"Nothing special plot wise, but the treatment of the female characters was horrible.",5,7 May 2014,"Thor 2: The Dark World Director: Alan Taylor Writers: Christopher Yost, Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, Don Payne, Robert Rodat, Stan Lee, Larry Leiber, and Jack Kirby Cast: Chris Hemsworth (Thor) Natalie Portman (Jane Foster) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) Rating: 2.5/5 Review: Wow. That was horrible. OK-not horrible but still really bad. Well, plot wise anyway. If you want to look at the portrayal of the female characters, its negative star worthy. So the movie, on the surface, was what I've come to expect these days-meh plot, lots of CGI, a healthy mix of comic relief, and romantic scenes at the wrong times. Female Character Portrayal: GOD WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED HERE. Let's see 1. Jane and Thor make kissy faces at each other the entire time 2. Frigga (Thor's mom) does some cool stuff and dies. Great. Kill off your only strong female character 3. Sif is hardly in it and has little control over the rebellion in the beginning. 4. Darcy is saved by the intern and makes out with him. THIS IS THE MOVIES BIGGEST PROBLEM TO ME. GUESS WHAT DARCY. HE SAVED YOU BECAUSE HE IS A DECENT HUMAN BEING. NOT BECAUSE HE HAS FEELINGS FOR YOU. AND YOU DON'T OWE HIM ANYSORT OF SEXUAL OR ROMANTIC INTERACTION BECAUSE HE SAVED YOU. YOU OWE HIM YOUR THANKS. THAT'S IT. F YOU MARVEL. So the plot: Like I said-meh. Aether is in Jane. Dark Elf guy wants it. Dark Elf guy gets it. There a big battle. The End. You may like this stuff, but I don't. Its formulaic and thus boring, and there is little to no character growth. I found myself so bored that I was discreetly checking Tumblr in the middle of the movie. Then something mildly interesting would happen and I'd start watching the movie again. Then I would get bored and feel the urge to read something. The closest book was These Broken Stars. I would have rather read that then watched a good portion of the movie. And I am NOT a fan of that book. There were a few good scenes and a few misplaced ones. Let's start with the misplaced. The newscast about Erik running around naked. Should have waited to revel that tidbit until the scene were Intern and Darcy found out. I guess Marvel was going for dramatic irony but it would have been a tad bit more suspenseful if we hadn't known. The kissing scene in Asgard. Let's see, the Aether is dangerous, no? Maybe you should work on getting it out and away from the Dark Elf guy instead? Or maybe have a conversation that doesn't end in kissing? I get that they missed each other, but they need to get their priorities straight. OK so now let's cover the good scenes. Far and few between. And usually didn't last for more than a second. The bit about Erik stripping and latter not wearing pants ""because it helps him think"" were funny. And the one where everyone told Loki ""if you betray him I'll kill you"" and then he replied ""Evidently there will be a line"". Then Loki died. Nice and dramatic. Shame he didn't stay dead. As a write this, I hear the future fangirls and fanboys gasping. But Loki! You say. He's misunderstood! Inner pain! His character has depth! No no and no. he is not misunderstood. He does have inner pain but that is no excuse. And yeah depth, but still. Doesn't necessarily make him a good guy. Reasons he is not misunderstood: 1. He consorted with the Frost Giants 2. He killed 80 people in one day 3. Enslaved Hawkeye and several other members of SHIELD 4. Tired to enslave the entire human race. This includes you. And you family and best friends. And probably would have let your pet starve. And this would mean no more Breaking Bad (or whatever show it is you watch) 5. Destroyed a large portion of NYC 6. Made all of Asgard vulnerable to attack from the Dark Elfs. 7. Got his mother killed. (Only person to care about him by the way) 8. Stabbed Thor. This guy is not be trusted. 9. Handed Jane over to the Dark Elfs. 10. He possibly killed Odin. 11. He is now ruling Asgard without anyone knowing what's what. Sounds pretty evil to me. You know what Loki is? A serial killer and a traitor to Asgard. He possibly killed Odin-WHO ADOPTED HIM AND RAISED HIM AS HIS OWN. EVEN THOUGH LOKI IS A FROST GIANT, ONE OF ASGARDS GREATEST ENEMIES . But he had a plan! No he didn't. Five thousand things could have gone wrong and he would simply do whatever he had to in order to survive. He doesn't care about anyone except his mother. And she's dead thanks to him. (Actually, I don't think he cares about his mother. It was for some sick emotional appeal) Nothing excuses what he has done. Nothing. The plot twist with Odin was just random. WTF? How? How did he survive? Doesn't matter. He manipulated Thor and will likely manipulate everyone else in the next movie. Loki is a bad guy.",Thor - The Dark World
638,writeduke,no subtitles,6,11 May 2014,"Good action fodder, I enjoyed it. I was perturbed that there was no translation available on my disk for the Black Elves speech. We had to guess what they were saying. I was wondering if this was only the rental disk I was using, if so, that's a mean way to treat your audience for renting and not buying. I am hoping the future movies have a lil more plot, maybe some deeper character builds. This movie seemed a bit rushed, like a lot was left on the cutting room floor. (Directors cut probably). The Black Elves were interesting, but there was no substance to them, they could have been any bad guy. Their costumes were cool, but again, they never got interesting, and no subtitles forcing the audience to guess their words made it worse.",Thor - The Dark World
639,WinterSoldier99,Why you can't miss this movie.,10,5 June 2014,Thor: The Dark World is an awesome movie. It has great music. Some of the best action scenes. Effects are mind blowing. A scene Loki and Thor that takes your breath away. Loki is what makes the film.Tom Hiddleston plays the role as if born to. He brings something to the screen that no one else could've. There is a good bit of comedy and emotion bouncing back and forth between Thor and Loki. Jane and Thor get back together (obviously from the picture) and Thor has been watching over her.Chris Hemsworth has been bringing peace to the 9 realms after the great Battle of New York. An old power thought to be extinct threatens Jane and the world. watch and see the twists and turns and pain they have to go to just save the world yet again.,Thor - The Dark World
640,srpc21,Very surprised by generous rating.,4,24 August 2014,"The first film was excellent; it was a great mix of humour, action and interesting characters with a strong storyline in the beautiful world of asgard (especially in 3D) I was really looking forward to the sequel but was bitterly disappointed. Asgard and Thor's supporting characters made a very cameo appearances and much of the film was based on earth with Kat (Darcy Lewis), Jane (Natalie Portman), and Kat's love interest (who wasn't in the first film). I appreciate the inclusion of Thor's love, Jane, but the other two had too much time and I don't think are interesting enough characters.The action scenes were short and none come anywhere near matching the opening fight scene with the frost giants in the first film.Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) played their roles well but with a weak script it wasn't enough to save it.",Thor - The Dark World

This movie is actually that freaking good, I was in shock.I first saw the film in cinemas back in 2013, and distinctly remember saying to myself 'eh', but looking back on that now, what was I thinking?? This movie is so much more than what the reviews are saying, it is a proper, hardcore enjoyment-fest, and I implore everybody to give this movie a watch, or, if you have already seen it, please give it another chance.Some of the writing is a bit crappy but like 90% of the film is so awesome that I could not take my eyes off the screen. It's a genuinely funny, feel good movie with GREAT action scenes, a believable plot line and deadset emotional story telling.I genuinely want to sit back down and watch it again, I'm not joking.8/10 - would give 8.5 if possible.",Thor - The Dark World

This movie had a better story and more darkness than Ragnarok. Thats why Ragnarok was a little disappointing for me. Because Ragnarok should be a thrilling ride.

Having watched the movie I can only say, the filmmakers did not disappoint. Thor: The Dark World is an epic, action-filled roller-coaster ride from the beginning to the very end. The film does not take itself too serious which is why the story works so well and is such fun to watch. After now three movies Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston seem to live and breath their characters and Hiddleston once more steals the show as Loki. For me, Thor: The Dark World is one of Marvel's masterpieces and I am already looking forward to a third movie!",Thor - The Dark World
649,Buildinwings,"Accomplishes what it sets out to, which is mostly popcorn-action, plus a few pleasant surprises.",8,9 November 2013,"Thor: The Dark World is a movie that doesn't shy away from its genre or source material. For the most part, it is a simple and relatively formulaic plot, couched in well-shot and entertaining action sequences. The context of the fantasy universe works well, again the result of ""leaning in"" to this quasi-supernatural setting. The other things this movie accomplishes is in developing the characters further, without falling victim to the stagnation that it risked in being a third installment with these characters. We see Thor mature, and place personal sacrifice ahead of the lives of countless people. We see Loki put aside differences for a common goal (however capricious he may be at heart). We also see the differences between Thor and Odin that explains why Thor is a guardian, and not a king.If all you're looking for is a fun, function film that follows and builds on established characters, you've found a good one. If you're looking for something deeply cerebral, or something that goes into the deeper implications of this multi-dimensional existence, look elsewhere. Overall, 8/10 because it accomplished what it set out to, 1 point off because the dark elf masks remind me of the ""putties"" from the Power Rangers, and 1 point off because ambition was set a touch low in being an archetype of a plot arc.",Thor - The Dark World
650,captainlokiamerica,Outstanding!,10,26 December 2013,"When I first saw this movie on opening night I was amazed. Alan Taylor did an outstanding job on this movie. The Visual and Special effects were absolutely breathtaking. The script was incredibly well written with the humour Marvel movies are famous for.I very much enjoyed the character changes in this film. Thor (Chris Hemsworth)changes from arrogant prince to a true hero. Loki (Tom Hiddleston)changes from trickster to a broken hero.The cast in this film did an incredible job, was not disappointed. The battles were epic and well choreographed.This movie contained so many twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time it was playing. I was not disappointed. I feel Marvel did a really fantastic job. The movie deserves more then ten stars.The rest of this review contains spoilers. If you haven't seen this movie yet, please stop reading it.Stan Lee's cameo was hilarious and perfect as usual. Chris Evans' Captain America made a little cameo that I really enjoyed (I was wearing my Captain America sweater when I watched it).""Thor: The Dark World"" had a plot twist that was completely unexpected. Loki died. He died a hero and I very much appreciated that. He died protecting his brother, Thor. I cried when watching that part, which I have never done before while watching a movie. Thor's reaction to this big moment was perfect as was Hiddleston's performance. Loki didn't actually die. Of course he didn't, he is the God of Mischief. The ending is what got me. Thor is having a talk with Odin, saying that he cannot be king and asking if he can stay in Midgard(Earth). Odin eventually lets Thor do so, but here is the part where I was stunned by: Thor said thank you and left. Odin was actually Loki and he said ""No, thank you."" Then the movie just ended and I was sitting in the movie theatre thinking: I have never been Loki'd so many times before.",Thor - The Dark World
651,rundler32,Comic book movie without much comic,6,14 November 2013,"Chris Hemsworth as Thor is passable (definitely better than his Home and Away days). When he is being coy you can see the cheeky Australian come out of him and he is clearly more comfortable in this side of Thor than the tough stoic version. Thor appeared to be missing the old English type of speaking that was in the Avengers or Thor which at times was quite witty. This also means I couldn't walk around the house imitating his old English speech which was disappointing for me. Chris Hemsworth does provide a little bit of eye candy for the ladies (impressive back and shoulder muscles I say), in one scene an actress purposely falls on him just to see if the muscles are real.Tom Hiddleston makes Loki his own. He is broody, depressive, defiant and a smart alec. He pulls all sides off his character, one could say almost perfectly. Hiddleston and Kat Dennings were definitely the two actors who brought the most to this movie in both acting and giving the movie character. Without these two actors I might as well have been watching the Expendables but this time set in space.Natalie Portman was not acting to the quality she has done previously, for example the Black Swan. To me she appeared to be going through the motions or it could be just the depth of the character she was asked to play was quite shallow.Kat Dennings who is the main actor in 2 Broke Girls was a stand out for myself. Every time she walked on stage I think I found myself smiling or having a laugh.Christopher Eccleston whilst being the main ""baddie"" in this movie is not giving enough depth for you to feel ""yes this guy deserves to be beaten and is a real threat to the nine realms"". Instead you are left feeling yeah he provides good action scene fodder and special effects. This character needed to be more menacing.Anthony Hopkins and Rene Russo play small but important roles in the movie.The special effects of this movie are very good. There seemed to be scenes where the special effects was the main actor without the need for any human or dark elf actor to step in front of a camera.The movie was directed by Alan Taylor, he has mainly done big TV shows in the past like Game of Thrones and the script was led by one of Marvel Comics main writers Christopher Yost. I feel that sometimes the characters though lacked the depth for some of the big name actors that were obtained for these roles. But if you're in a $300 million movie within 9 days why wouldn't you act in this Marvel studios cash cow.A criticism I have of this movie is that it is following the trend of a 'serious' comic book movie where there seems to be more brooding than fun. Yes the movie has great special effects, good action and drama. Though comic book movies have seemed to forgotten the term comic relief. That is why I enjoyed Tom Hiddleston, Kat Dennings and at times Christopher Hemsworth when they had their moments on not taking themselves too seriously.Other moments I really enjoyed were the cameos of Chris Evans as Captain America and Stan Lee the creator of Marvel Comics.Overall as an adult, Thor: The Dark World was solid with great special effects, some solid performances and other actors going through the motions. I have a feeling that young teenage boys will really enjoy this movie. This movie is a popcorn movie built for the masses and definitely a movie that will not strain your brain. It is slow moving and at times it is appeared the storyline chucked together inefficiently to ensure it fully explains things that are not needed for an action movie. Time wise it goes for almost a full 2 hours.http://mondaysheroes.wordpress.com/thor-the-dark-world/",Thor - The Dark World
652,kyprosck,A step in the right direction,8,3 December 2013,"This is Thor as it should have been!!! This time the filmmakers didn't fear going all the way with the fantasy aspect of Thor and that paid off big time. The production design of Asgard is spectacular. Alan Taylor is a better fit the Kenneth who could handle the Shakespearean part of Thor but i thought he was lacking in the action department, and what's with all those dutch angles!!! Chris Hemsworth owns the role of Thor and after seeing him in Rush I think that he is not just a movie-star but also a good actor with potentials to be great. As for the other actors, Tom Hiddleston as Loki shines in every scene that he is in, showing amazing emotional depth, especially after one of the movie's many twist. The rest of the cast are well suited for there roles and Kat Dennings is still annoying but cute. The bad guy is somewhat weak in my opinion especially if you consider the fact that he followed Loki as the main villain. In conclusion the movie is very good with amazing action and some genuinely funny moments...and speaking of funny prepare your self for one amazing cameo by an avenger. 8/10",Thor - The Dark World
653,siucok,Not exactly flawless.,7,6 November 2013,"Overall, I have to say that I did enjoy the film. But there are a few things that came to mind and they're pretty annoying. First, is Asgard's defense so weak that their enemy can enter the main palace so easily? Where were Odin when Frigga was attacked by Malekith and his ally? Would the protection of their Queen be so lame? I don't get it. Second, if some alien are doing some destruction of that magnitude like what Malekith is doing at Greenwich which is on earth, wouldn't the other members of Avengers have heard about it? I just think it'd be more believable if that final scene doesn't happen on earth. That's all. Sorry for ranting, I just couldn't help it.",Thor - The Dark World

Out of curiosity, I looked up the director, and unsurprisingly, he's done mostly just television shows. Gotta be honest, not a very good transition. I think I could have looked past it eventually if the story was interesting, but it really wasn't. Jane is a pretty much blank slate, only there to motivate Thor, not really a character with anything going on.

Like most of Marvel movies in recent years, Thor: The Dark World is presented in a light and humorous tone(in contrast to DC Comics movies that are darker and more serious). It's a straightforward fantasy/sci-fi/action movie. Some attempts on humor would seemed a bit desperate and unnecessary, especially when they are doing some serious sequence. The storyline is pretty standard, but it's pretty much what is expected. The visual FX is good, but the 3D version is still the Hollywood version of ""Show me the money"".

The visual effects are fantastic.I actually got the subtle homage(probably not intended) to Dr Who since Chris Eccleston was Dr Who once after all.I expected to be surprised, and was.

E-mail, Facebook, coffee, BOREDOM.Any relation between this and Norse mythology is merely in the names. Thor could not fly; he rode a chariot. His hammer only returned to him if he wore magic gloves. Frigga was not Thor's mother, Jörð was Odin's love and Thor's mother. Loki was not evil, merely a particularly annoying practical joker and mischief maker. Odin was not a peace keeper, he was a pure warmonger always willing to start a fight. Sif was not a warrior, she was goddess of the harvest and grain--and blond. Of all the characters depicted in this movie, only Heimdall was fairly accurate. Natalie Portman is always pleasant to see, but her limited role in this film was not enough to salvage this pathetic excuse for a movie.IMDb viewers gave this movie a 7.2, obviously because they have more familiarity with Marvel comics than Norse mythology. Very sad.",Thor - The Dark World
659,comicman494,"An improvement on the first, a fantastical return to Asgard",8,9 November 2014,"Most importantly, The Dark World felt like a post-Avengers story, both plot-wise and in the characters' arcs, whereas Iron Man 3 felt like it could have been told before the Avengers with little difference. Hemsworth again vanishes into his role, and Hiddleston is as slimy as ever. The humor was probably some of the sharpest and least forced of all Marvel's movies so far, with everyone really upping their game. I loved the change from Shakespearean drama to Lord of the Rings-style fantasy; it really allowed for some epic locations and battles, while overall showcasing some new sides to Asgard and the universe in general. The use of various color palettes was genius, changing from greys to greens to oranges and browns really differentiated the worlds and tones. The plot mechanisms also gave way to some of the most inventive and thrilling battle sequences I've seen. If Man of Steel dragged a bit for you in the battles, you'll probably feel the opposite here. In fact, the entire film clips along briskly and could stand an extended cut. I was just sad when it ended; I wanted more. Some clever twists and turns kept me completely invested in the characters and story. Unfortunately, an undeveloped villain left a lot to be desired, and prevents it from ranking as Marvel's best for me. But for sheer exhilaration, it parallels Marvel's The Avengers and Man of Steel, earning bonus points for the change to outright fantasy genre Thor belongs in, as well as some brilliant tie-ins to Viking culture. There were also some very appreciated nods to the first film, and a scene that will take you so off guard you'll need the movie to pause just to recover - in a good way.",Thor - The Dark World
660,kozarkar,Arguably the best superhero movie of 2013,8,10 December 2013,"In one word , it was ' Brilliant' It is undoubtedly better than its sequel, and also it's the best Marvel film till date , behind the Avengers! I must say I didn't expect it to be so good! After a little disappointing Iron Man 3 earlier this year, it's very satisfying to see a good stand alone Marvel film It's a must watch, for all the Marvel fans, and if you weren't pleased with the first Thor , this would definitely please you ! It's a good entertainer Chris Hemsworth does a better job this time around, and with Portman, Hiddleston, and others, all playing their part. So all in all, its a good watch , even for a non marvel fan , I reckon , go for it !!",Thor - The Dark World
661,gillr001,Ermmmmmmm,7,4 November 2013,"Don't really know what to say. I went in with great expectations and around half way in, the movie exceeded all of them. But at the end I felt like something big was missing. The movie starts of quite dull and boring. And around half way out really picks up but the end again wasn't as good as I wanted. The villain is also rubbish. I am a massive superhero fan. But Thor 2 wasn't that great. Loki was the only character that was actually interesting and hilarious. There was some good action sequences but I wont ruin anything. So go and watch the movie but don't expect something amazing it was like the amazing Spider-Man all over again (but not as bad)",Thor - The Dark World
662,BulmaBriefs,Fun Fresh and Exciting,10,20 November 2013,"There may be a third movie coming sooner than later. With the success of the first movie and the second being number one for twelve days thus far, why wouldn't there be a third movie? Hang on to your seats people because the mischievous Loki is at it again. At least this time his ways may have changed just a little but not by that much. Just go see the movie and stop reading the reviews. Believe me, this wouldn't have been a number one movie if it wasn't worth watching. I even rated it ten out of ten because it was that good. It was the best movie I saw this year and if I could go see it again I would. Hopefully, it will be on DVD next year.",Thor - The Dark World
663,RomanHowell,"Lots of Ideas, Not Fully Explored",8,14 December 2013,"Thor: The Dark World is a big step for Marvel Studios. The movie marks the first of several projects that is not an origin story, The Avengers or Iron Man. Everyone loves a good origin story but these next films will determine if the individual Marvel movie style can continue. First up to bat: Thor.Picking up directly after the events of The Avengers, Thor: The Dark World brings us back to Asgard where Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is imprisoned for his attempted conquering of Earth in The Avengers. Also, it is revealed that his brother Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) visit to Earth in The Avengers was part of an ongoing war he is waging to bring peace to the nine realms. Thor is continuing this crusade in beginning of The Dark World but he is interrupted when his mortal love, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), discovers an ancient evil known as the Aether and the Dark Elves awaken to steal the Aether for their own diabolical uses. Thus begins the epic.To keep it short and spoiler-free, the movie is fun. It tops the first Thor in action and humor. Marvel movie creators have fine tuned their wry sense of comedy where characters are nonchalant in the face of danger and it still cracks people up. Where it stumbles, though, is in character development. The movie is just so full of plot that it has no choice but to throw it all at the audience as quickly as possible. This, unfortunately, results in a lack of simple seemingly insignificant scenes that actually build emotion and connections between the characters. A good example would be the Dwarfs' slow but entrancing singing scene from The Hobbit which threw in a dash of culture and brotherhood between the adventurers. There are scenes like that but it feels like half of them are missing or more time could have been dedicated to them. Hopefully, a director's cut will amend this.This rush also affects Loki. Loki is a great trickster, master of illusion and deception. Hiddleston has nailed the part down to a menacing glare and he has secured a seat as the main villain. But due to the film's speed, the audience doesn't have enough time to grow to trust him enough to be shocked by his next move. It feels more like a waiting game to see what he'll do next. Despite the fandom for Loki, the movie decided to push him to the side for a one note, evil for the sake of evil, Malekith, leader of the Dark Elves (Christopher Eccleston). Perhaps they're waiting use him in Thor 3. They certainly gave a very nice setup for the next chapter in a twist that will make everyone, once again, eager to see what will happen next.",Thor - The Dark World
664,micahkaminer,My opinions and review on the movie,9,21 January 2014,"I Loved this movie :) i personally recommend this to all my friend... Its based on Norse Mythology which is a subject im really into reading a a lot about but anyway the opening scene is really good then it picks up where the first movie ended.Battles scenes are decent.I couldn't help but notice how much this movie wore its influences on its sleeve. The movie version of Malekith is a Star Trek villain, through and through. He's mostly Romulan (I mean, look at him) with a little bit of Klingon thrown in. All his scenes feel like they're from a Star Trek movie (and not a great one), even down to the lighting. Some Asgard scenes feel pretty Star Trek-like, too. Any of the scenes that involve air battles feel a whole lot like Star Wars. There's an obvious Lord of the Rings influence, and I don't just mean in terms of the way characters talk or have beards. The way director Alan Taylor actually shoots close-ups looks very similar. And let's be real here: One big piece of the plot is Crocodile Dundee 2, with Asgard in the place of Australia (OK, I'm half-kidding on that one).Even Asgard seems less godly and more outright alien in this movie. Their medical facility (sick bay?) has non-magical apparati. Jane Foster even knows what they're using to examine her. It sparkles less. Odin's throne room isn't shot with the sort of impossible brightness it had in the first movie. It's dimmer. Anthony Hopkins plays Odin with less godlike certainty, even. There's a shot where he's considerably shorter than Thor, and he sort of just looks like a guy with a beard. He says outright the Asgardians aren't gods and can die.And that's what ultimately makes Thor: The Dark World a winner, in spite of its problems. It may occasionally lose some connection with the audience, but it always endeavors to re-establish it, either with a nicely timed joke or a gripping action turn. Also: It ends on a comic-book cliffhanger. That's pretty rad.",Thor - The Dark World
665,hphomolka,Just average,6,27 November 2013,"Compared to the previous Thor, this one was just average.Compared to any other recent avengers movies this one was not good at all.If you're looking for Stiff acting, Failed joke attempts and plot holes then this is the movie for you.Special affects are OK but below par compared to other Marvell movies. Its was nice to learn a little more of the back story of Asgard but it was the Asgardian acting that made the film particularly bad.Lots of people are talking about how the anti-hero of the story, Loki, is this total rebel bad-ass and compare him to other beloved villains like Heath Ledge's Joker but not so. Loki's participation in the film is minimal.Overall, just average, but I wish I would have picked a different movies to see at the cinema.",Thor - The Dark World
666,ukshine,Great return for Thor,9,31 March 2014,"As a bit of a Marvel fanatic, I always look forward to their superhero movies. Thor first became a sensation in 2011 when the not too hard on the eye Chris Hemsworth came crashing in with his hammer onto our big screens. I loved the Kenneth Branagh directed movie, which I felt brought a new kind of sophisticated humour rarely seen in the Marvel universe. I was apprehensive about The Dark World as I wondered whether after the smash hit that was the Avengers in 2012 if Thor could stand of his own accord again, without the help of other superheroes. Because lets face it, Thor (although pretty to look at) is in my opinion a little boring compared to the other Avengers. It was his interaction with the other characters in the Avengers that made him stand out.But it works.Thor The Dark World plays to Thor's strengths, the strengths that made him stand out in the Avengers, which is his interactions with those around him. In Thor The Dark World we get to see more of my favourite brotherly love. Thor and Loki (played by the fantastic Tom Hiddleston) were again the stars of the show. Their relationship kept me glued to the screen and their interaction with each other was simply magical. The twist of the two brothers working together to avenge a family death meant that we begin to see how complicated the brothers relationship is. I think that this development in the brothers relationship is pivotal to the success of this movie and certainly left me wanting more of both Thor and Loki.The plot involves Thor again enlisting the help of his favourite humans, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and Darcy (Kat Dennings) to save the universe from a new threat. The evil dark elf Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) is determined to plunge the universe into eternal darkness so that he may rein supreme. Christopher Eccleston does an good job with what I feel is a rather limited villain. It is difficult to portray a villain who is barely on screen or who speaks a made up language making it difficult to convey specific emotions. I felt that the movie lost some of the magic from the first films with such a bland villain. It was the presence of Loki (a far superior ""bad guy"") that saved the movie for me.I can overlook certain aspects that made me cringe. Zachary Levi whom is a fantastic actor and one of my personal favourites, had the most ridiculous accent which caused me physical embarrassment whenever I heard him speak. Some of the humour I felt was forced, I never again want to be subjected to Stellan Skarsgard running naked through Stonehenge. The humour in the movie was at it's best when Loki returned.Personally, despite the under developed villain and the desperate attempts at humour, I loved this movie. I think I am justified in saying my enjoyment was mainly down to Tom Hiddleston's portrayal of Loki. His performance I cannot fault and without him I feel this movie would have been sorely lacking.",Thor - The Dark World
667,buster-boy,Perfect Follow-up,8,3 November 2013,"Thor: The Dark World is an ideal example of how a super-hero sequel should be done, it steps up the action, the emotions and the stakes.Thor 1 was a good super-hero film it was the minimum it should be but Dark World steps it up a notch it has an excellent story showing more of the Asguardian universe than ever before. It, like Iron Man 3(which i personally didn't like), shows the affects the Avengers had on the hero and their supporting characters.Now when I saw Loki in the trailer I thought that he wouldn't play any part at all in the story and he was only there to bank in on his likability but I was wrong he does belong in the film and wouldn't be right without him.I would recommend seeing this film massively to anybody who loves adventure (my second favorite Marvel film after the avengers)P.S Christopher Eccelston, yet again, makes an excellent villain.P.P.S If you do go and see it heads up there is 2 after credit sequences so make sure you sit through ALL of it",Thor - The Dark World
668,wilscwnbjosman,Great Addition To Phase 2!,8,2 November 2013,"*Acting*: Fantastic - Kat Dennings stood out to me; although she had a lot of screen time, more so than the Warriors 3 it appeared - but she portrayed the character so well that I really didn't care because frankly, she was very entertaining. Chris Hemsworth reached a new level of 'fantastic' with his performance - he held his own and kept the film going.Not a huge amount to say about anyone else; Hopkins is always great, my personal 'meh' regarding Portman continues (Foster seems to be a believable character, though so kudos) and Ecclston didn't get a huge amount in the way of screen time. Hiddleston was incredible. I leave him until last, because... well, he was incredible.*Effects*: Much like the first film, I thought the effects of this film were flawless. There are few films which have effects and graphical quality which match Thor, for some reason they are literally amazing, and better, in places than Iron Man 3.*Directing*: There is a scene where some Elves fight some Asgardians with flying ships - this to me felt way too Star Warsy. But other than that, Taylor did a good job.*Writing*: The effects and acting aside, the writing was one of the best bits if this film: it was surprisingly funny throughout, and the Old English way of speaking is continued well.*Fight Scenes*: *drools**Tone*: I loved this tone. Seriously, it gave hopelessness when it was necessary and I loved that because the audience needs to feel hopeless against the bad guy so that when the good guy wins it's just that much more satisfactory. And Loki just added a giant enigma to it. *Characters*: Loki is my main point regarding this; compared to Thor (1) he is very different, but nonetheless unpredictable. And because of Avengers, he has become even more so. Ergo, there's a bunch of moments where 'I did not see that coming.' Darcy, too, seems to have a larger part, which was fantastic. Having watched all the other films previously, I can now say I like Selvig's arc, and his character, while not required so much by the plot, helped continue on his story in a post-Avengers world.*Chris Hemsworth's Muscles*: He looks like a Nord when he takes his shirt off. It might be the hair.*Weaknesses/Drawbacks*: With Iron Man 3, I found the score to be great - and memorable because of it - so I therefore own several songs from the score album. However this score, not so much. I'll try listen harder on my second viewing, but I was not blown away by it (though I could hear Iron Man overtones...) I'm not sure if Agents of SHIELD have spoiled me for intra-Avengers references, but Chris Evans pops up and I'm not sure if its really necessary, though it was funny and nice to be reminded of the fact we're in the Avengers world. I didn't feel it was long enough. The midway-through-film action sequence in Asgard provided several battle sequences, all of which ended rather abruptly.And the funeral scene, while moving, felt long in comparison to the battle sequence. The scene itself I had no problem with, just the sequence before it. I also felt it missed something. I liked Jane Foster's input into defeating the bad guy, and the comedy was great, but I still feel there is something missing, and I can't quite put my finger on it.The 'intern', I felt, wasn't a necessary character. While it was somewhat nice for Darcy to have a guy, it's not like the audience, or indeed, Darcy, would have suffered if he wasn't there. And indeed, the plot would definitely not have suffered had he not been there. I guess that's my own particular approach to film-making.*Future Set-Ups/Questions*: The film does what all great franchise films do - make's the audience ask questions about the end and the franchise's future. Taylor has set up something that makes me want to explore. Mid- credits scene too, interests me - for those who don't know, it's Benicio del Toro and Guardians Of The Galaxy setting up that film, and probably Thanos in some way too. The post-credits scene is nothing special, though gives us a point about Thor on Earth, and is kinda funny (won't say why.)",Thor - The Dark World
669,vigetowow,Thor: The Comedy World,6,1 November 2013,"I was very interested in seeing how they would up the Thor sequel and I have to say it was a great movie on the whole. Asgard was amazing and had a great feel about it, you felt you were there yourself. But I felt although humour in the marvel movies is great and they hit it just right in the first movie, it was to forced in this one. It almost felt like they should have run a canned laughter track and had some of the awful jokes written by the people who made 2 and a half men (the world most over rated crock comedy). Thor's use of flight was really great and had some great shots of him flying about. But like in the previous movie Loki stole the show! Christopher Eccleston did a great job playing the Dark Elf king. If you love Marvel you have to see it just to complete the set.",Thor - The Dark World
670,BrendaVictoria13,"I loved it, but somewhat disappointed.",8,17 November 2013,"I overall enjoyed the movie.I loved when they showed Loki broken down due to the death that went along with it. The scene with the funeral was beautifully done, as well. I also was really caught off guard when they cut off Thor's hand, it was such a good surprise, even though it was a bad thing. There was still a good flow to the movie.But, there were a few things I didn't care for too much in the movie. For Example, the beginning of the movie and middle of the movie was a bit slow. The action of the movie didn't really start till then end. It took a while to pick up, which wasn't what I was expecting. There also were some scenes that I felt weren't necessary that were in the movie. The last thing I was disappointed with was my favorite line in the trailers was not in the movie.I still loved the movie and would recommend it to anyone who is curious about Thor.",Thor - The Dark World
671,doyledarragh8,Marvels first let down Spoilers MIT be in this,6,9 November 2013,Thor 2 first off wasn't a bad movie first of all. The Main reason i was let down was because there was too much Humber it was like they where forced to shove Humber down are troths but Besides that Tom Hiddleston hes scenes where so Funny The Other reason was that the villain Malekith played by Christopher Eccleston i felt that he was week and kinda plain it wasn't Christopher Eccleston fault he just didn't suit the role he just didn't hold up and an other reason there was a fight between Thor and Malekitch and he was so bad it was like it lasted for 2mins maybe less then Thor won it was a joke and there was parts of of the second half where Loki dies and after that scene they went back the jokes like from there really id think thats where the movie wood pick up and start to be come more serious but no they keep on with the humber i really think this was the most disappointing movies this year One of marvels most disappointing movies ever i wanted to go in turning my brain off but i just couldn't,Thor - The Dark World
672,odellhuff2,Thor the Bor,4,18 November 2013,"Though I'm a devoted fan of SciFi, video games, fantasy and anime, I've always felt like an undernourished geek because I missed the superhero/comic book fan gene—especially when the genre can produce something as seductive as ""The Dark Knight."" Watching ""Thor: The Dark World 3D,"" however, has cured me of any residual shame in my belief that comic book stories are more cartoonish than cartoons. This movie is just a comic book with lots of frames, and not a good one at that: poorly directed, badly written: ""I believe fate has brought us together."" Argh! 'Kiss' had more subtle makeup. The storyline disintegrates like English cow patties under a cave golem: before there was even light in the universe there were the Dark Elves. Despite this implausibility, is that why they're called Dark Elves? With the war (over what again?) lost, along with their ""aether"" (OK—the aether graphics are cool), being some cosmic evil essence, I think, supposedly to be hidden so thoroughly that no one would ever find it—""ever"" lasting only until Natalie Portman accidentally falls through a rabbit hole to trip over this most unfindable object on a pedestal under a spotlight. Acting OK but even Natalie Portman is lackluster and unbelievable in this kind of movie, a 'superhero (god, whatever) defeats (insert evil dude here) who wants to destroy the universe', crash bang kapow story we've heard and seen way too many times. Oh, and destroy a major metropolis in the process—any will do, as long as there are identifiable landmarks to pulverize—the destruction of which is as gratuitous as Thor delicately dabbing himself shirtless at the holy water fount, not that we're complaining. Sorry, Thor, while we appreciate your saving the nine realms and sterilizing London, it's just not going to work out—though your mother likes her, Natalie's got to be pushing 40 and you're over 5,000, you're an Odinist, she's Episcopalian poor deity—palace annihilated, bossed by father, his mother and brother murdered, knocked about by Dark Creatures—but nothing gives the god of thunder even a grunt of discomfort but the repeated bitch slappings of the physicist scorned I resolve to never see another one of these again— hopefully because they stop making them.",Thor - The Dark World
673,ff9000,"All style, no substance",4,10 November 2013,"The acting was solid. The production value was superb. Everything else was really poor.The back story and character motivations are laughably sparse. Most of the characters are completely one-dimensional, with the possible exception of Loki. The plot is the most boring and typical of all action plots - some ""bad dudes who happen to be really ugly"" decide to ""destroy the world for no reason other than being evil"" and ""only our hero can save us all"", etc. Moreover, it was lazy writing - whenever an absolute miracle needed to happen, it conveniently did, every time. Of course this is a mindless blockbuster Marvel movie so we shouldn't expect much. But the thing is that these kinds of films CAN be made with a reasonable plot, pacing, and character development. The writers were obviously just going through the motions to cash in on the surefire moneymaker sequel, and from a business perspective it is hard to fault them. But it says a lot about the sad state of Hollywood in 2013 that this film currently has a 7.7 on IMDb.",Thor - The Dark World
674,tsyates2020,Great Movie!,8,10 November 2013,"I really enjoyed this movie and in some respects feel it was even better than the first. The storyline and characters are much more developed so you a better sense of the life of Thor. You also see that Loki has true heart felt feelings for his mother and brother which is not seen in Thor 1 or the Avengers. I laughed several times during the movie which was great considering the heavy subject line.The only drawback to the movie is the overly ""comic book"" and ""superhero"" feel to the story. There is the token ""helpless woman"" who the hot superhero is working to save. This is way over played in superhero movies these days so I cannot deduct rating stars for Thor following this ""guideline"". Definitely a must see movie for all action-adventure movie fans!",Thor - The Dark World

It was perfectly balanced between tragic and amusing, between epic and casual, between ancient and contemporary,... The acting is superb (as ever in the Thor movies), the costumes look great and the script exceeds all expectations. The beautiful animation of Asgard, the ships and magic added a lot to the movie as well. The chemistry between the characters was very well and interestingly portrayed as well, especially the ones between Thor and Loki and Jane and Thor. Thor 2 was surprising and amazing, I'd definitely recommend it to any fan of Marvel movies.",Thor - The Dark World
676,liopleurodon-king,A Surprisingly Good Superhero Film,8,5 November 2013,"I am usually not a fan of the superhero genre. However, I did watch most of the recent superhero films due to my sister being a huge fan of them. I'm usually unimpressed with superhero movies, even with the successful Avengers and the Batman trilogy. It is a massive challenge to create an entertaining storyline in a film that everybody knows the hero is going to win in the end. Recent superhero films (especially Man of Steel) failed at this and I was prepared to face disappointment upon stepping into the cinema hall.Thor The Dark World was one that I can honestly say was entertaining. Surprisingly. I think I was generally happy with it because of the realism of the conflict that they face. In the Avengers, when alien beings attacked earth, humans on earth somehow decides to do almost nothing. No appropriate military action by earth's governments. It's the same with Iron Man 3, US military did nothing when the president was captured.In Thor The Dark World, the threat was at Asgard. The whole of Asgard was ready to go to war. Due to the effects of the alignment of the Nine Realms, portals between worlds were opened but as it all happened too sudden, nobody from other realms was able to react on it. This is more believable than the Avengers' situation (where Loki was on Earth for a long period of time and Shield knew he was up to something having stolen the Tesseract yet no military action were taken when the aliens attacked).You still have to ignore some plot holes and ridiculous logics (like why Asgardians still fight with swords and shields when their enemy who were in suspended animation for the last 5000 years had laser guns) but it was still very entertaining for a superhero film. The development of the main characters were done satisfyingly. Thor, who were a rash, short-tempered Asgardian prince with a thirst for war, is now more mature and sensible in making decisions. We also saw the other side of Loki despite his continuous mischiefs.The balance of action, humour and ""superhero realism"" makes it fun to watch. It's not overly complicated but it's also not too dumb or predictable. Overall I'm quite happy with this film and I would recommend it to anyone who is starting to lose faith in the superhero genre.",Thor - The Dark World
677,rashelledave13,Better than the first...,8,3 November 2013,"Thor: the dark world is far far far better than the first movie for me... and a greater adaptation than its predecessor.In the first movie, all i saw was a spoiled, arrogant, barbaric prince from a realm unknown to us earthlings. He did nothing but irritate me and wasted enough of my brain cells and time. :lBut, HEY!!!! in the second movie, oh my! there is substance in every speech that the characters give. My! My! Also, Thor is not a spoiled barbaric prince anymore. He uses his mind this time. There's also more depth between the interaction of him with his brother, loki. Though betrayal and hate separated them, i was astonished how they came to terms with their differences and emotions for their departed mother. As always, CGI is good. Better character development for the protagonists. The story have more substance and was more logical. humor decreased but rarity makes the humor funnier. lol i love loki's character more... :D tom hiddleston was perfect for that part. if it's so good.. why did i give an 8?I love christopher eccleston but i think his character, malekith was taken for granted by the writers so this movie can have a villain... it's like saying ""oh well.. you're just gonna die in the end so i will not put much thought into your character"" another reason was the questions that popped up in my mind... i thought they were going to hide the aether where no one can find it? they should've placed a guardian in that place if it's really dangerous. lol how lucky was jane that she's the one to find the hidden aether?",Thor - The Dark World

With a fantastic contrast of scenes and emotions this film kept me entertained and hooked until the very end. It made me laugh, made me scared and made me cry (especially the scenes surrounding Loki). Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgard made some hilarious jokes and made me and all of my family laugh. Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman conveyed the relationship excellently, Christopher Eccleston was captivating and Tom Hiddleston made me smile and cry, what more can I say( he is an amazing actor and my idol).The plot twist at the end was fantastic and totally unexpected, the whole plot was well planned and written.

679,saser400,Surprisingly good,9,5 November 2013,"Let's start by saying that I'm a big Marvel fan and I'm loving what they are doing with this film series. Having said that, the first Thor film was a little 'meh'. I'm glad to say this one improves on it in every possible sense. It starts off slow but builds into an engaging and thoroughly enjoyable story.The story is pretty good for a film that makes no logical sense, the characters are well-developed, the action is excellent, the script is good and the jokes are amusing throughout. There is less overacting and the overly Shakespearian language has been toned down a bit, but still present as it should be. And I'm glad to say that there is only one moment for girls to swoon over a shirtless Chris Hemsworth.The CGI and effects were excellent but, for an effects-driven film, they were almost overshadowed by the quiet intense moments between Loki, Odin and Thor. The acting was solid throughout from pretty much every cast member, Hemsworth doing a good job as the hero, Tom Hiddleston and Anthony Hopkins with solid performances and Ecclestone excellent as the menacing villain, even if his motivations and plan don't make much sense. The most surprising thing about this film was its successful attempts to be funny. It could almost be called an action-comedy, with many laugh- out-loud moments. A film that is fairly dark, hence the title, but still doesn't take itself too seriously. There are missteps; I might be the only one who didn't realise that Charing Cross isn't 3 stops from Greenwich, and frankly I didn't care, it was still an amusing sceneThe film itself is littered with Easter eggs and references to other Marvel characters and films, which make it very enjoyable for fans of the comics. The best part of this film was the ending, with a few huge reveals, teases and WTF moments for anyone with knowledge of the comic books. This is simply a well-made superhero film, possibly one of the best ever. Certainly one of the best films of this year.",Thor - The Dark World

683,chels-rox,"I have not came here to mock, yet more to congratulate 'Thor: The Dark World'",8,30 October 2013,"*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*I attended a premiere screening with high hopes for this film, and left feeling really accomplished. Alan Taylor had placed a fresh input in this film and it worked incredibly.I watched it in 3D. I didn't think it was necessary to watch it in 3D, as it wasn't used to its best. But, I watched it due to the fact I wanted to see it the day before it's release and Tom Hiddleston!Stellar performances all around. Chris Hemsworth, good. Tom Hiddleston, great. Christopher Eccleston, good. Anthony Hopkins, great. Kat Dennings, hilarious as usual. Stellan Skarsgard, just as funny as Dennings. One characters I believed didn't being her best performance to the table was Natalie Portman, yet this must of had to do with the director conflict back in late 2011- early 2012.This movie, without a doubt, is one of the more funnier Marvel movies the franchise has to offer. Loki had most of the laughable lines, his name being 'the god of mischief' and same goes for Dennings and Skarsgard The action scenes were great and quite realistic, feeling like you truly were in the nine realms.Finalizing quickly, this brought much more then the original Thor in my opinion in terms of action, plot and performances. Major plot twists are well thought and unexpected, which pleased a fan such as myself. Overall, one of the best movies I have seen all 2013. Eight stars.""When do we start?""",Thor - The Dark World
684,rhebecky17,I loved the Film!,10,3 November 2013,"Thor: The Dark World is a 2013 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character - Thor who fights to restore order across the cosmos but an ancient race led by the vengeful Malekith returns to plunge the universe back into darkness. Faced with an enemy that even Odin and Asgard cannot withstand, Thor must embark on his most perilous and personal journey yet, one that will reunite him with Jane Foster and force him to sacrifice everything to save us all. It was really a great movie, thrilling, with humor, great visuals and highly recommended to watch not just by the marvel fans but definitely must watch by all. Chris Hemsworth as Thor was hotter, smarter and much powerful this time. I loved the brothers (Loki and Thor) fight side by side against the enemy, this was the best we've seen for Loki with his trickier acts. Marvel keeps delivering high level characters act which make us more excited on what to expect next.",Thor - The Dark World
685,jencook-823-715296,"Action hero movie, emphasis on the ACTION",6,17 November 2013,"In this movie, there is way more action than plot. It appears that the director/writer was focused on making the movie ""exciting"" first, then coming up with some plot devices to fit in with it. The ""Aether"" is particularly uninspired as a choice for the big bad. It's an excuse to skip writing any characterization for the antagonist; (""Hey, it's just an evil entity that's silent and just sort of.. there. Yay! Less work for us!""). (SPOILER) My biggest complaint with the movie (and this bugged the heck out of me) is the completely out-of-place spaceships and fighters (Think x-wings like Star Wars. Yes, really.) Asgard is supposed to be a realm out of myth. There is a reason everyone gets around using the bi-frost, isn't there? If everyone has spaceships, why were we told in the first Thor movie that the destruction of the bi-frost prevented transportation to other realms? And if these people have guns, why do all the characters on Asgard fight with swords/clubs/daggers? I'm trying to get over my annoyance about this ill-advised overlap with sci-fi. Not having any luck with that. The movie is entertaining, though, in the same way that mindless summer blockbusters are. This would have fit right in with summer releases. Some nice in-jokes for Marvel fans. Now for the actors:Natalie Portman is pretty boring. She doesn't have much to do except swoon, really. Chris Hemsworth does a good job; in my opinion there are limits to what you can do with Thor as he's written in these movies. A bad actor could make a disaster of it; a good actor can make it just fine. There's not much room for an actor to show off his craft. Anthony Hopkins is never bad, but both he and Rene Russo are just sort of there to occupy roles that have to be filled. Very one-dimensional, but then again, that's not out of the ordinary for superhero movies in general. The best part of the movie?? TOM HIDDLESTON. The dude wears Loki like a second skin now. He steals every scene he's in. The character of Loki would, in anyone else's hands, be as simple and one-dimensional as all the other characters in the movie. Instead, he brings subtlety to a role that could easily be reduced to scenery-chewing. He's a master at the grin that conveys, all at once, the mischief of a little boy, the evil of a true villain and a bit of the resentment of the orphaned and overlooked son. I found myself paying much more attention anytime he was on screen just because I find his portrayal to be bordering on the sublime. 6 out of 10 overall, because of the (gag) spaceships and the lack of any suspense for the audience.",Thor - The Dark World

687,sietse-arne-schelpe,The jury is still out,3,30 October 2013,"I watched it in premiere in Belgium. As they only showed it in 3d I can say. Don't go to the 3d version. The quality is bad. Some frames are not sharp at all. And you miss a part of the story. As the plot and movie itself I am not saying it is bad. But some solutions are just stupid. I like Marvel a lot but in this movie I am missing the feeling of the Marvel universe. Just to say 1 thing. If you have an army as strong like in the Avengers , why is Thor fighting them alone. Why is iron man not helping, Captain America or even the hulk. The army was there to shoot at the spaceship. So there are gaps in the story and the 3d version sucked to make a final opinion on the movie.",Thor - The Dark World
688,CD-official-fanpage,"Great film, very gripping and action packed",8,30 October 2013,"Thor: the dark world, is a film that, when I walked into the cinema, I had very high expectations of because the first one was very good, I was not disappointed and the viewer won't be either. The film has a very good beginning as within only ten minutes of the film starting the character of Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth, is introduced to the audience just after (spoiler) a circular storm occurs, pouring over Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), Ian Boothby (Jonathon Howard) and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), this is then followed by some mild violence and the action gets better from then onwards. It is extremely gripping and fast paced throughout the whole film, there is never a quite moment. (spoiler) There is even a small appearance from the much loved Marvel character, Captain America, only small but it is a cool moment that reminds you that this isn't just any old film, this is a Marvel film. I really enjoyed this film and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. The ending of this film makes you very excited for the next instalment of the Thor films.",Thor - The Dark World
689,sienubbink,Amazing!,10,1 November 2013,"I had high expectations for this film, and boy, was I NOT disappointed. I absolutely loved it. The amount of plot twists were uncountable. I think Marvel did great, great follow-up to Thor/The Avengers. My personal favorite is Loki, and I simply cannot wait till his next featuring. This is definitely a recommended watch. It has action for the guys, love for the girls, and everything else. There is actually no crtitiscm I can give you about this movie. I can't think of any crappy Hollywood movie cliché's. In my point of view, this movie was amazing. Story line was great, actors were great, the lines were great, everything was great. Ten out of ten from me.",Thor - The Dark World
690,catabrazil-834-539677,A very satisfying continuation of the Marvel movies that will have you smiling for hours after.,10,2 November 2013,"A truly satisfying sequel to the Avenger series. Those that have seen the previous movies will be completely thrilled, and those who are just starting will appreciate the snappy, witty dialog and the action-packed scenes. The film is filled to the brim with adventure and the romance is just subtle enough to exist, but will not bore the younger ones. The French version of this film is terrific. Some jokes were better rephrased in French than in English, from what I've seen in the trailer. A couple scenes were almost word-less and still had me shaking in laughter. There are also heart-wrenching moments, and a predictable twist at the end (it couldn't have been a Marvel movie otherwise!) but the direction of the twist was unexpected. Stay after the credits for extra scenes.",Thor - The Dark World
691,tobywan_kenobi,"Much, much better than expected",9,2 November 2013,"I have just returned from watching Thor: The Dark World and I have nothing but praise for it! For some reason i was expecting to be underwhelmed by this outing but am extremely and pleasantly surprised by the quality of this film....the acting, particularly from Hemsworth & Hiddlestone is genuinely first rate, and the direction skillfully engages you and even more skillfully avoids falling in tired cliché which is extremely impressive as the Dark Elf plot line is, to be honest, nothing new.As a reader of the Thor comics it is fantastic to see the characters of the main protagonists being fleshed out in line with their comic book portrayals. The Loki that Hiddlestone has slowly shaped over three films is now, for my mind, the Loki of the comic books. It's this kind of thing that really pleases me. Hemsworth's Thor is now much more rounded and fleshed out (pun intended, my girlfriend was extremely impressed with one particular scene). The effects for Mjolnir and indeed for all of Thor's powers were much more considered and impressive than in previous films . Nice to see.As others have said, the main pulling point in film is the relationship between Thor and Loki and it's this that gives the film a really satisfying depth and interest. This is a highly enjoyable and impressive film and I will be seeing this again, (in 2D though as 3D adds nothing) and whole heartedly recommend this to others. 9/10",Thor - The Dark World
692,curious-avi,Boring and unworthy of your money and time,3,8 November 2013,"I have seen Thor 1 and I thought that it was a nice introduction to something good they will come up with in future. I didn't like the character of Thor, the way it was portrayed later in the avengers and was disappointed with it. Then comes Thor: The dark world and i have been reading pretty descent comments about it everywhere and decided to give it one last chance and boy i was wrong. This movie has thoroughly and utterly disappointed me, there wasn't a single WOW moment in this movie, special effects had nothing special in them, story: over complicated along with astro physicists and their weird instruments and what not. It was humorous at time but seldom the timing was appropriate. My verdict: I will personally not suggest my friends to watch this movie or any future Thor movie.",Thor - The Dark World
693,soumitra-bandi,"Good action, Good acting by few, loosely bound story line.",7,9 November 2013,"Given, it has thrilling action sequences, WHEN they appear. CG is fine, in 3D they look cool and fantastic. Acting is average, but some characters you should watch out for are.... Odin, his queen and the Asgard Gate Keeper. Awesome characters written beautiful; laded with honer, commanding obeisance, expressing legions and affection to their kin, in their own subtle yet exuberant fashion. Characters that were very well filled in with actors who are know to execute such roles with color and fines of master painter.When it comes to Thor and his conversation with the male counterparts in the movie, he speaks like he should, like Son Of Odin! However things change quickly when he is talking to his girlfriend, it gets little mushy, in a cheesy way. And Thor's hammer looses weight a couple of times, I mean literately. (Reminds me of my nephews Halloween costumes, that scare the s*** out of my dog) Characters from the dark side lack a good introduction, and a follow through. Which make it little hard to really submerge into the move. Some of the ends are loosely tied. Their mother ship looses some serious weight, from the first half of the move to the second, almost gives me proportion creeps, now that I am thinking about it. (you will know what I am talking about when you watch the movie) However they were acted out well.Over all enjoyable move. It has good thrilling action sequence which gets your blood pumping, earthlings are lil disappointing, don't mind them, go see the movie! There is a good chance you might like it!!! Oh, and get some caffeine in to your system, you will feel pumped like the teenagers next to me in the theater, they sure enjoyed the move!!",Thor - The Dark World

It confused me a bit as in the first movie the Bifrost was destroyed? And now its suddenly OK again? Bit of a let down in the fact that I would of liked an explanation on how on earth they'd be able to fix that. Tom Hiddleson definitely done it for me though, I could stare as Chris Hemsworth all day if I could but my eyes were on Hiddleson this time, he is an amazing actor and suits the role of Loki Perfectly. I would of loved to have seen a wee fight between Jane Foster and Lady Sif, you can see them giving each other dirty looks but they do nothing about it? Quite pointless to add that jealousy in if nothing is to be done about it! Amazing special effects though and a lot of violence - the 2 things I love the most!

I must say that I was a slight bit skeptical when I found that Kenneth Brannagh was not directing this film, and in the end the movie didn't have the same twist of the first one. I will say that i enjoyed Thor The Dark World just as much, or better then the first movie, even without the flow of the first movie. All I can say is they left a little bit to be desired with the villain, and the movie was way to short. The acting was fantastic on everyone's part, and it was a great movie. Join Thor and Loki as they travel between worlds, in an epic battle between good and evil. The question is, do they make it out unharmed and avoiding death?

Anyway, good CGI, simple but efficient storyline, and nice actors for an overall good movie. 8 Stars =].Go and watch it now! This sentence is just to get enough lines, I'm reviewing a marvel dammit! Not a masterpiece of any kind!",Thor - The Dark World
697,buttons9173,"Just my thoughts. Beware, there are spoilers!",10,11 November 2013,"This is a spectacular film; one of the best one's that I've seen in awhile. I'm still thinking of this movie after seeing it on Saturday. And it's Monday now. I'm actually going to see it a second time tomorrow!I love how they made Loki really sassy, and how Darcy was becoming more in it. Thor was much, much more mature as well. It seems like all the characters had a time to shine.Though there was a lot of funny moments in this, it had a lot of heart breaking moments. Such as when Frigga died, and the whole funeral scene for her. And then there was the scene when Loki 'died'. During the scene where Loki 'died', I saw character development. At the end of the first Thor film, he states that he did all of his doings for his Father, Odin. But with the second Thor film, he says that he didn't do it for him. We also saw that Thor and Loki love each other, though they do not show it.Tom Hiddleston is a brilliant actor, he portrayed Loki's emotions very very well. Like at the time where Thor told him ""No more illusions"", when his mother died and he went to see him. Tom literally did a great job at that, from his eyes to even looking like he was shaking. All of the other actors did a great job, too. I also enjoyed how more of this movie took place in Asgard, instead of Earth. I feel as if that had a huge impact of the film. We also got to see other realms, which drew me in more.Not to mention, the end. There was a hang there, sort of seeking to a third Thor film. I think that the cliff hanger was a very good one, and I am definitely looking forward to what comes more of the Thor movies, and even Thor and Loki in other Marvel movies, such as the up coming Avengers movie - though I'm not quiet sure that Loki will be in that. I would recommend this movie to anyone. 10/10 Great film.",Thor - The Dark World
698,KatePrimus,Wow.,9,12 November 2013,"First off, I have to say that I went charging into the movie theater not having a clue what this movie was going to be about. I wanted to see it because Thor is my favorite Marvel series, and I didn't have any expectations set besides hoping this Thor would have a lot less romance than the last Thor and that the movie would spend most of its time anywhere but Earth. I was pleasantly surprised. Most of the movie took place on Asgard and other planets. Of course there was romance, but I felt like it had its place and didn't interfere with the plot. Darcy and Ian's little romance was lighthearted enough that it was enjoyable to see. After Jane was taken to Asgard, my biggest fear was that she was going to somehow end up immortal by the end of the movie so she could live with Thor, since Odin had brought up several comments on how Jane's life would be over in a flash compared to Thor's. While the bit about the ""the entire universe hangs in the balance"" is so old it has mold growing on it, I liked how the movie didn't end right after the Aether was extracted from Jane. To me, this gave more strength towards Thor's character flaw. He created an elaborate plan just to get Jane off of Asgard and even chose to work with Loki, yet he still failed and Loki (seemingly, at the time) paid with his life. I felt that Malekith should have been elaborated on more; he would have been a more interesting character if we knew who he was and why exactly he wanted to commit evil deeds. Besides this, the movie was fantastic. Although Kurse was a bit hard to take seriously because his helmet-thing bore close resemblance to a warthog in my eyes. The music fit well with the scenes, the deaths and Loki's supposed death were emotional enough for me (although I felt like Thor's reaction towards his brother's death was rushed; he and Jane took off after Thor watched Loki die in his arms). Loki's humor was brilliant, although I don't quite understand why we had to keep watching Erik running around nude on the television — we saw it once and I think once got the point across well enough. I thought the funeral scene was beautiful and emotional at the same time, and I can never get enough of Asgard's night sky. I also liked how Heimdall was given more of a part in this movie; he's a cool character who didn't get enough screen time in the original Thor. I also happened to see this movie in 3D and I'm a person who wears glasses and does not own contacts, so I usually resent going to see movies in 3D, but this movie was so worth it and I would actually go to a 3D showing again.",Thor - The Dark World
699,joshuamelancon,Not as good as the first.,6,13 November 2013,"I liked the first one. I knew nothing about Thor as a superhero going into the movie. The first immersed me into a new world while doing a great job of bringing that world into our own. Everything looked great, it felt different, and reminded me of experiencing the Lord of the Rings in a smaller way.This one...not so much. Yes, it's a sequel and it's given that the audience should already be immersed into its own world, following the first. But...as it progressed, the jokes got more common, the clichés showed up, and I swear I would've made a good profit if I had $20 every time Loki used his trickster-hologram move. Now, I did enjoy most of the jokes, because they felt appropriate and in the right place at the right time. But when the world about to collapse, the fabric of reality about to break, people are dying, space-time is going out of whack...I find it very hard to take the conflict seriously. I'm not expecting Dark Knight or Man of Steel seriousness because that's just not how the movie presents itself. But as the plot unfolded, I just wasn't able to follow much of what was going on. Then, the villain himself...what a let down. I didn't expect much in the first place, but was hoping nothing like Iron Man 3. His grunt is apparently stronger than the hulk and his almighty, ever-destructing, reality-breaking weapon/power didn't seem so great once it met Thor and his hammer.I enjoyed the action, some jokes, and the special effects looked spectacular. I liked how it showed more of the less glorious side of Asgard and showed different realms. I also enjoyed being able to watch a Marvel hero on screen again.",Thor - The Dark World
700,natestahlw,Where's Thor?,2,13 November 2013,"**SPOILER ALERT**Full of action, humorous, and an overall fun film with one major flaw; ""Thor"" is nowhere to be found, replaced by an entity that amounts to little more than a big guy with a hammer.The Thor faithful, especially those that followed Walt Simonson's adaptation of Snorri Sturlusen's stories in the prose and poetic Edda, will more than likely be disappointed in what Marvel has done to their hero. Gone is the super-being that travels faster than the speed of light, gone is the mightiest entity in the nine realms, replaced by something that is ""Thor"" in name alone. The ""Thor"" we find in ""Dark World"" suffers from many of the same weaknesses and limitations that humans do, leaving us wondering, and asking ourselves; just what is so special about this character?

It not only has serious and ""dark"" moments, it also has humor, love and friendship. A bit of everything, and that's what makes a movie so great.The parts between Loki and Thor were so intense and amazing. I remember them and I get chills. I really don't care if it sounds stupid, it's true. The dialogues are perfect, and the chemistry that every single character has with each other is amazing. This movies just gets you.

Firstly I'd like to say that I enjoyed most of the film. The Dark Elves looked quality with their Armour and masks etc. Thor was good. Loki was better. Special effects were great. Fighting and action scenes were a good example of how to show action without the use of shaky cam, which is far too common in ""family Friendly"" action films these days. The main issue I had with the film was the humour. It was way out of balance. In particular, Dennings' character. I didn't care about her. In the first film they had a great balance with the seriousness, action and humour. Dennings was in the background and said the odd dopey thing, but in this film they really shoved her silliness down your throat and ramped up the jokes which ruined the balance of the film. She had way too much air time for a character irrelevant to the story. Hiddleston Was great as always. Rene Russo looked like a bad-ass with her blade.Anthony Hopkins was....Anthony HopkinsThor's friends weren't in it enough.Thor has some issues for wanting to be with Portman over Jaimie Alexander.

710,carrieannebowyer,Excellent but not enough Loki or Frigga,10,6 December 2013,"This was an excellent installment in the Marvel Universe. As always Tom Hiddleston steals the show with his Loki. However it should be noted that he is not in the film anywhere near enough as he should be. The pairing of Tom and Chris as Loki and Thor is always great viewing and sadly there is not enough funny duo action. It has been noted that the film is a lot shorter than most and a fair few good scenes have not made the final cut, mainly Loki, Loki and Thor and Thor and Frigga. Saying that the film is great with a brilliant cast. Anthony Hopkins does seem a bit wooden in this but it is due to Odin aging and the fact I think he has just had enough of the situation in Asgard. It is very much worth a look and more.",Thor - The Dark World
711,redpandarevolution,Even more shallow than the first.,3,6 December 2013,"The plot barely exists for this film. Generic evil people try to take over universe, Thor stops them, the end. Which might have been alright but there was very little action in this mindless action film. What little fighting we got was poorly orchestrated and repetitive.The dialogue is wooden and adds nothing. The characters with the exception of Loki have no depth and only exist as an assortment of clichés. Hiddleston makes for a great Loki but that is literally the only good or interesting thing in the entire film.Thor continues to be the worst Marvel movie franchise and Hemsworth is possibly the worst actor to ever star in multiple major movies.",Thor - The Dark World
712,shiabeth13,Most disappointing sequel you'll ever pay to see!,4,20 December 2013,"Thor: The Dark World was truly a dark disaster. Although many critics disliked Thor for lack of plot, the Thor sequel fell entirely short of its predecessor.The first scene opens up with a red, demon-like, liquid spirit and evil force that will eventually inhabit Natalie Portman's character and Thor's love interest, Jane Foster. The creepy, flimsy aliens that have possession of it are not only weird, but let's face it, just down right ugly. In addition, fans of the first Thor expected for the chemistry between Thor and Jane to develop, something that never quite happens. Yes, Jane and Thor kiss and yes, Jane fondles over Thor as he passes out while saving the world. But the two just ""happen"" to meet again, giving no real connection to the audience. Thor just happens to ""fall in love"" somewhere in the first movie, a scene that had to be deleted from the big screen.The biggest fault, be it mine or the producers, was the continuation of the film from the events of the Avengers. Because I didn't see the movie, many scenes I simply did not understand. Had I known, I would've seen the Avengers prior. But I thought I was going to see a Thor sequel and not an Avengers knock-off? Overall, it was even more disappointing than I could have imagined. Better luck next time, Marvel!",Thor - The Dark World
713,asghar9,Thor,9,12 January 2014,I just love the movie. The star is a perfect thunder lord. He really looks like a super hero. The movie is getting better and better. I would love to see more episodes of Thor.The Avengers team is not at all complete without Thor. The series is growing too good. Even better in every next movie. Every single movie of the series is a master piece. Great mind working behind the same. I always wait for the next episode of the series. Unfortunately not easy to create too many in a year but 2014-2015 are quite good. THOR the dark world was more than expectations. loved to watch it on the big screen.,Thor - The Dark World
714,lukas-hammonds,Predictable and imbecile,4,2 February 2014,"*contains spoilers* Comics movie adaptations should be viewed as marketing exercises aiming to expand the reader base of the particular brand, and to sell even more books and merchandise to them. As a result, these movies, in an attempt to win over more fans, always pretend to be more than what they truly are: power-fantasies, tales written for teenage boys. Even though Marvel's target audience has shifted in age, the original characters created by Stan Lee back in the sixties were intended for this group. Now I don't mind a teen fantasy being transformed into a film, if it was marketed as such, like in the case of Narnia. It's a straightforward deal: you got what you ordered, French fries. But when it is puffed up with all the 'proper ingredients', it becomes a farce: techno babble and spaceships for science-fiction, over-the-top-acting and instantly predictable plot lines for family drama, bad guys chasing good guys in a dog fight for action, and even more miserable breaking-the-fourth-wall puns for comical relief than in the first part. I bet that no one from the management knew what this film was really supposed to be. Consequently, the actors stumble across the scenes as if they didn't know what the heck is going on either. At some point, you will ask the burning question: why would I care for the protagonists in the first place? A third-grade character from Family Guy is more engaging and has better lines than any one of the staff of Thor 2. Nothing in this movie makes too much sense. All we see is a race of Übermensch people living in glittering CGI pipe organs with all the wealth and knowledge to rule several realms, yet dumb enough not to prepare for a sneak attack on their capital. And don't even get me started with the Convergence and the Nine Realms... Truth be told, Portman was a refreshing experience, but after a while, even she was all over the place with her multiple roles of the affectionate Senator Padmé in love with the young, ambitious male leader-to-be, her being a super-smart astrophysicist and her being pretty much the plot device embodied. I wasn't a fan of the first part, but it had least some memorable scenes, and the out-of-world super-hero-in-trouble in New Mexico thing going on. This movie is the prime example that you cannot make up for an uninspiring story and sloppy writing, not even with cobbling together CGI, Hollywood headline acts and a whole bunch of high-tech Uruk-hai Orcs.",Thor - The Dark World
715,Vasil_Enev,I was fascinated from this movie,10,25 January 2014,I was hoping this movie to have another part because I was really fascinated by the first and second one so I am glad to see it coming.I really liked the moment when Thor became better person and demigod in the first movie and also the turnabout in the second movie when the two brothers Thor and Lookie united each others powers to fight against the evil forces and the fact that Thor and Jane Foster met each other. And also the fact that she made her dream come true seeing the bridge. The end of the movie makes me think that there will be third part and I hope so.I expect not be disappointed.,Thor - The Dark World
716,Alterion-me,My review of Thor: The Dark World (2013),4,5 February 2014,"Being directed by Alan Taylor; I had high expectations for this film, even though I don't think I've ever seen one of his films I have watched episodes he has directed for TV (The Sopranos, Rome, and Game of Thrones). Chris Hemsworth reprises his role as Thor and Natalie Portman returns as Jane to re-spark the romance that was (thankfully) left out of The Avengers. One of the first problems I noticed with the film was that the dialogue was really bad; a lot of the time it added nothing to the story or characters. An example of this is that we get the same explanation of the 'Convergence' from about three or four different characters. Yes, I get it; it's a major plot point, MOVE ON! And the time that isn't dedicated to hammering in information that we already know, is filled with unnecessary quips and one-liners. One of the worst culprits of this is Loki; there's almost an entire scene where he just makes some really terrible jokes, I just wanted him to shut up for the rest of the film. Although I will say I do actually like the character of Loki (despite the fake deaths); he is a good character played by a good actor and they do give him some great moments (His part in the ending of the film is pretty cool; don't worry I won't ruin it for you). I did feel that the relationship between him and his ""mother"" Frigga (Rene Russo) was a bit forced as I didn't really get the feeling of a deep connection between those two in the first film. On the other end of the spectrum; a love triangle between Thor, Jane and Sif is introduced and doesn't get built up at all throughout the film, ultimately leading to nothing anyway, so what was the point? Most of the action scenes in this film just made me question how the Asgardians had defeated the Dark Elves before, considering they have those awesome grenades. The film excels in special effects and they did a great job in creating the beautiful Asgard set. With some great music to build the excitement of the scene, it proved to be a really enjoyable piece of action. I was very disappointed to realise that Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) is a terrible villain; firstly I downright didn't like the look of the Dark Elves, their motive was really bad; they don't like the light though at most it's of a slight annoyance to them, like a fly that keeps flying in front of your face (doesn't mean you have to destroy the universe). The Dark Elf on steroids was really the antagonist; if you're going to watch the film, watch it for this guy, he's pretty cool, Malekith just ends up looking like the damsel in distress. The ending was nothing inspired; the teleporting around was pretty cool but the novelty wore off after the second time. I hated how they end up defeating Malekith; it was boring and predictable and made no lasting impression. All in all this film was below average. Though I thought the directing and special effects were very good, the writing on the other hand was awful; it had bland characters and an uninteresting story filled with pointless dialogue. Even the actors didn't seem to care about this movie. Some of the action scenes were good but that was mostly down to the visual effects and music. And even though it was nice not to have Loki as the antagonist; Malekith was just plain awful.",Thor - The Dark World
717,giggly_austin,Thor: The Dark World,10,15 January 2015,"Thor: The Dark World, is one of the best 2013 Marvel movies. It gives you smiles, tears, & jaw dropping moments. If you love Marvel movies & have not seen this movie I recommend seeing it. No spoilers here, so it's 10 out of 10 for me. I loved it and all of the other Avenger movies. I hope you like this review and enjoy every MARVEL movie out there like me. Not all MARVEL suck. They have gotten better over the past years. I don't see why you wouldn't want to waste you money on this movie. Iron Man, The Hulk, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow & Hawkeye are for sure the best MARVEL heroes out there. You can for sure trust me on that. :)",Thor - The Dark World
718,pecmertens,Lazy writing leads to lots of missed opportunities,2,18 February 2014,"Let me start immediately with my major gripe; the writing is awful across the board; the story, the dialogue and the action are all extremely bland.Ten minutes into the movie, the story appears to be identical to that of Avengers, and it stays like that until the end. An immense old power is found, the good guys try to destroy it and the bad guys use it to take over the world. The power is nondescript and functions as a deus ex throughout the film. The big disappointment is that, you don't get a good demonstration of what this power is until 90 minutes into the movie, and without spoiling too much I can say that it really isn't that much of a threat at all, just like the relatively small army of aliens in the Avengers wasn't much of an actual threat either. I truly can't imagine any way the premise of the movie could have been worse. Copying the premise right from your last major release and making the bad guys even less of a threat...The dialogue consists mostly of cheesy one-liners, which doesn't help making the relationship between Thor and his family, and him and Jane more interesting, even though things got of to a reasonably good start in the first Thor movie. There's hardly any real tension save for the most textbook cliché's with Thor challenging his father in an argument, where the king's position is portrayed as such a blatant idiocy he loses all his stature.The enemies are 'dark elves' which all look identical and about which we learn absolutely zero-squat except that they are invisible to everything and everyone unless they need to be beaten by a bunch of Asgardians to aid the progression of the 'story'.Meanwhile, we visit Asgard, but we learn nothing about it either. We see identical and disposable soldiers/guards and a king sitting in a large EMPTY palace, and that's all. The one star I gave is for the rare moment of humor and displacement when the queen of Asgard briskly tells Jane to do everything she tells her to without question, and Jane immediately realizes that this woman who's bossing her around is not just a demigod but also her new mother in law. There is so much more room for stuff like this, however it's never used.The fighting choreography is awful; mainly lot's of close-ups of elbows hitting prop-armor. The tactics of Asgard's armies are those of kindergarten play-warfare; run forward and shoot, nothing more.Truly a lackluster affair..",Thor - The Dark World
719,AllanCompressor,Another fantasy/sci-Fi film exceeding reviews,8,2 March 2014,"This film falls into the class of fantasy/sci-films FAR better than critics would lead you to believe. This is far more ambitious than the original Thor, with a far more clever script. Tom Hiddleston can always be relied upon for solid villainy; he is appropriately used. Christopher Eccleston is a well known British actor who has impressed me in everything he has done since Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth. The dynamic between Thor and Jane Foster is less interesting than between Thor and Loki. The whole plot about how dark elves are trying to commandeer this protean ""Aether"" to somehow re-immerse the universe into ""dark matter"" probably had actual experts like Sean Carroll rolling their eyes. But who cares? A British stage actor plays a bad guy trying to destroy the universe, while the good guys try and stop him. This is a solid escapist film with lots of good actors having fun, and more than a fair share of witty moments. This film could have probably fallen short with inferior editing. I feel this stands as a legit film independent of the Avengers' juggernaut. Two other fantasy/sci-fi films also, IMHO, which far better then critical reviews were the Hobbit (lots of a abuse: why??) and, surprisingly, Oblivion. I finished this film very pleasantly surprised with how well it worked.",Thor - The Dark World
720,tadams5257,Worth the rental,7,9 March 2014,"Overall, I think this was a good movie to watch with the family. It had the typical good guy versus bad guy with the girlfriend in jeopardy. I did not think the plot was as engaging as the first movie, but it was still captivating enough that I sat and watched without leaving the room for popcorn or snacks. My son really loves the action and adventure of the show and thought the fight scenes were ""really cool!"" The scenes with the crazy professor made the kids laugh and it was comical to see the interaction between the intern and her intern. I think Natalie Portman's character needed more substance, but it was definitely worth the Redbox rental.",Thor - The Dark World
721,niels_stevens,Another Marvel movie,4,26 March 2014,"The plot of the movie wasn't good; it was a typical marvel movie: the good guy catches or kills the bad guy and gets the girl. The first Thor movie was fine but now the second one is just for the money. I mean it's a marvel movie people will always go even though it might be terrible, they just want to see it because it's a marvel movie. There was not much action in the movie but when there's a fight scene it will be is full of special effects and spectacular so that kids love it. Also Loki is back in the plot, I personally think it's time to let the character go, he's always in the movie as a bad guy but they still trust him and they think he's going to be good again. The movie was just written to make money; it had very little to do with the previous films. It's becoming more of a series, it's just another episode; something changes between Loki and Thor and then they (or only Thor) kill or capture a bad guy. I also think they're completely missing the point, the whole universe is at risk but it's more important that Jane is fine then the whole universe being wiped out. The universe being at risk wasn't really important although I thought that was meant to be the point. For Thor what's so fun about a movie when the lead character is invincible and kills the bad guy in less than a minute. There's a whole movie about the wellbeing of one person who will eventually die and the lead character will still have to live a long time after she passes, but the one thing the movie: the risk of the destruction of the universe is a side-issue.",Thor - The Dark World
722,email-959-579395,Yuck,4,27 March 2014,"I just want to echo the sentiments of many here... this movie is not good. I loved the first Thor, it was methodical, developed the characters and dosed out the power of Thor and his foes in small and very impressive bites. This leaves you with a healthy understanding of just how powerful and dangerous this fictitious world is.This film dispenses with any sort of sense and throws a ton of visual effects at you hoping you'll be blinded enough to overlook the shoddy script. It didn't work :/. The story gives no depth to any characters, and the only saving grace is it didn't really weaken any established characters from the first film. I don't require much in the way of thought provoking content, but give me something. Action for action's sake is played... and so is the Thor title if they don't turn it around.",Thor - The Dark World

They are making so many that the quality is just not possible. It's like it's about quantity instead of quality. Every Marvel comic book now has 3 movies. How many Thor or Captain America movies do we need. I know it's about making money. But as a consumer I want great movies. Make a killer movie that leaves everyone satisfied.

724,sandaraleme23,"Not amazing, but better than Thor (2011)",5,5 June 2014,"The plot isn't anything mind blowing, and like most superhero movies, the dialogue was incredibly cheesy and it made me cringe at times. I don't know if it was just Natalie Portman's acting or Jane's character, but her vulnerability annoyed the heck out of me. She was just a really flat character. I give it a 5 because of Loki. First of all, Tom Hiddleston IS an amazing actor. Second, Loki himself is three-dimensional, unpredictable, and advanced character, and I am so intrigued because he is so DIFFERENT from other Marvel villains. I feel like the movie really revolves around him rather than Thor. Overall, it did exceed my expectations because I thought Thor, the first movie, was terrible and The Dark World was a little better.",Thor - The Dark World
725,Mister_Beefy,Thor: From Marvel to Mundane,5,7 February 2014,"Marvel, best known for revolutionizing the comic industry in the 1960-70s, has recently taken their infamous monthly deadline work-ethic and adapted it to the motion pictures industry. And, while this tactic may be a guarantee for a monthly onslaught of paper-backed mayhem, the same cannot necessarily be said in regards to consistency of quality.The most recent example: Thor: The Dark World. Why the sophomore attempt at the Thor franchise may have slightly outperformed its predecessor in regards to direction, story concept and art design; it, ultimately, still found itself over-welding its weighty Hollywood Hammer, resulting in an utter demolition of continuity, writing and optic nerves.Once you get beyond the pseudo-(meta)-psychics and babbling tech-talk, the background story is left suffering from a big floppy case of motivational dysfunction; as you find the characters haphazardly wandering though scene after scene, perhaps searching for a certified script doctor.And, while the story lent itself to several subtle moments of potential acting gems, most notably from Tom Hiddleston, they were soon obliterated under the mystically omnipotent sledgehammer of Hollywood Blockbuster.Sure, we could chalk up Thor: The Dark World as just another comic book inspired popcorn-fest if Christopher Nolan hadn't already proved that you can masterfully take the absurd and polish it into a piece of cinematic art.So, while this most recent high-def installment to the Marvel universe may satisfy your immediate super-hero craving, expect its fatty leftovers to spend their golden age in the back issues. 5.5/10",Thor - The Dark World
726,illusioner,"i would use 4 words for Thor: The Dark World, Fun Fun Fun and Natalie Portman",8,8 December 2013,"i would use 4 words for Thor: The Dark World, Fun Fun Fun and Natalie Portman :).Watched it today. I liked Thor 1, it was a Fun, well executed and acted Origin story with the main lead fitting for the role. Chris Hemsworth is a perfect Thor, just like Hugh Jackman is a perfect Wolverine. Chris has totally taken over the role of Thor and made it his own. When you see him on screen he truly is a believable God of Thunder. And when you see an actor embrace a role like that, you automatically enjoy the movie. I was hoping Marvel would improve more in Thor 2 specially after the Blockbuster The Avengers, and boy, they have . The Action and effects in this one is top notch and as big of a scale as they should be, and Marvel also finally realized that they need to show Thor fly (Thanks to Man of Steel :D), and they have with some awesome sequences. No comparison to Man of Steel of course, but still some really awesome scenes, specially in the end. The Final sequence is literally been fought every where, you'll know what i mean when you see it. Special effects this time around are absolutely fabulous, although i am very much disappointed at the use of 3D. Its not utilized to the extent or in a way that you would feel the 3D, if i had a choice i would have preferred it in 2D. As that makes the Action and effects pop out.OK aside from the cool action and visuals, i won't go much in to the story line as always, an overview though. After the Bifrost destroyed since part 1, Thor is busy bringing peace to the 9 realms when an ancient weapon, forged by the king of The Dark Elves, long beaten and forgotten by the Asgardians, is activated accidentally by Jane (Natalie Portman) and The Evil King Awakens with his army. From here onwards the story move forward as Thor needs to protect and save Jane and all 9 realms from this powerful weapon and The Dark Elves. And of course what a Thor movie would be without Loki (The Awesome and charismatic Tom Hiddleston), Thor requires Lokis help, in which again i won't go in to details, and we get to see some awesome scenes with both specially when Thor frees Loki, and you will witness an Awesome Awesome and unsuspected scene in a hall when they are talking . What leads to there alliance, is again you need to see for yourself . and the conclusion to that will make you go WOW....For the last Epic battle, this time around the last action sequence is kind of centered in Greenwich, London, you'll know what i mean when you see it and if you guys are following Marvel Agents of Shield TV series, you should watch Episode 8 ""The Well"" after watching Thor 2, as it starts, where the final battle ends, u'll enjoy more. I loved every single minute of the last sequence, it had some really really great moments and as much as i want to talk about them here, i can't as it would spoil it for you. It had some cool funny moment as well. And i have to say one thing, i just have to. Last year, Man of Steel was criticized for showing too much destruction and collateral damage, every other person who didn't like the movie was talking about it that they didn't like it coz of that. Well, i think those people who criticized MOS for those specific reason, should stay away from this one and hate this as well , as Marvel has shown some massive destruction in London as well as Asgard and they have shown some major collateral damage as well. Lets see how many people make this ridiculous complaint now. Just Enjoy people, Superman is Alien with super powers, Thor is an Alien/God with Super Powers, what good a movie will be if they don't get to show us what they are capable of, at least this time around, Marvel didn't shy away from these things and actually showed it.Rounding up, i need to mention the Awesome Kat Dennings, every time you see her on screen, she will make you smile if not laugh, she is one funny lady . As good marvel have used Dennings character this time around, they have really miss used Lady Sif, Jamie Alexanders character in this one. Everybody was hoping to see her more in action and Marvel actually promoted it that way as well, but that is not the case, she has almost the same role as in 1.All in all, Thor: The Dark World is an awesome and fun Sequel, there is not a single dull moment in the movie and any person who loves fantasy, scifi and action movies, will love this one as well. It is a worthy sequel, bigger and definitely much better. The only thing i didn't like about the movie was its 3D presentation and the fact they didn't give Lady Sif more screen time, as i was expecting to see her more in action . Oh well, i can settle for seeing Natalie on screen anytime though lol. Another thing which is itching my brain, thats related to Loki, but since it is directly related to the plot, i can't discuss it here. but i really hope that makes sense in the upcoming Marvelverse.Go watch Thor: The Dark World in the cinema. Its Fun and Awesome. Highly recommended.Score 8/10 (it would be 9 for me, but the 3D was disappointing)",Thor - The Dark World
727,arierashelle,Thor: The Dark World,10,9 October 2015,"Thor: The Dark World is a Marvel action fantasy film that director Allen Taylor takes you on an adventure with the god of thunder to save his beloved, Jane Foster, from the evil that consumes her. Following in the expectations of all Marvel movies, Thor: The Dark World is packed with amazing actors and actresses, a setting that helps you feel as though Asgard is a real place, and a well-developed cast. What more could you ask for? For starters let's talk about the fact that all Marvel movies have these actors that fit each part perfectly. It almost seems like they are all planted in a garden and perfected until it is time for their shot in a movie. For instance Chris Hemsworth, who just happens to be 6'4"" with a godlike body, becomes Thor in the movie. No matter what other character he plays in any other movie, we will forever be known as Thor, the god of thunder. Another example would be Tom Hiddleston, who also just happens to be 6'4 with a villain like persona, transforms into Loki, the god of mischief. These two men will never escape the identity of Thor and Loki, unless they are some other type of species like Anthony Hopkins. When Anthony Hopkins plays a character, you only see him as that one character, during that one movie. During the movie it didn't click in my head that he was Hannibal Lector, all that I saw was Odin. The cast for this movie was unbelievable, not only were the men amazing but the women were fantastic. (Spoiler alert) Kate Dennings plays Darcy Lewis the intern of Jane Foster, who decides she needs an intern herself. Speaking of their relationship Jane decides it's time to start dating, so obviously something would go wrong that Darcy would need to crash her date, eat some of their breadsticks, and convince her to leave. Not only is Darcy hilarious but her intern is funny as well, so is Eric Selvig.Anyway, the set design was crazy amazing. Inside the Asgardian Castle was so well constructed that it makes you feel like you're really there. Not only were the set designs great but the graphics were fantastic. They didn't look like the scenes were filmed in front of a green screen, but looks like they're actually doing everything that we see on the screen. To tie everything together, the costume designers who fashioned the clothing and the wigs to look as if it should actually be authentic Asgardian clothing. The detail on Thor's armor really represents his status and his character's personality of not only a warrior, but a leader as well. The designers also put a lot of thought into Loki's breakdown scene; his clothes weren't perfectly pressed, but truly focused on the element of pain that he was experiencing.Not to throw shade on the first movie, but this movie flowed a lot better than the first. The characters were more established, there was no need to add any exposition explaining who this is and what he does and so on, because the foundation was already laid out from the first movie. The characters themselves have grown as well since the first movie; you really begin to see Loki and Thor as brothers when they escape in the enemy's ship. You also begin to see that Thor truly loves Jane, not an infatuation like Romeo and Juliet, but an actual deep love for her. You no longer just see Loki as the angry, spoiled, handsome villain, but instead you see him as this man who just wants to be loved. He wants the same love that he sees Odin has for Thor. You see him lose the one person he actually loves, his mom. You see the part of him that you feel you can not only trust but love and have sympathy for.For me, Thor: The Dark World catapulted Marvel movies to the next level. Through every scene you never once wonder ""when will this movie end?"" It's like a good home cooked meal, you just want more and looking forward to the next one.",Thor - The Dark World
728,jakkar,"Underwhelming, soulless.",5,10 November 2013,"A weak entry into the Marvel lineup, this film has most of the right ingredients but lacks something vital.I left the cinema disappointed - but without any great glaring crime to judge the film for.The action sequences are filler, lacking exciting or creative choreography in favour of formulaic exchanges of gain and loss, the mechanics of drama laid bare. The plot is epic, but no-one seems to have any real grasp of what 'the end of the universe' would really mean. The villain is an excellent actor not given anything to work with - a character without a personality, without either strength or weakness, without any motivation except that issued bluntly in the prologue. He hasn't a single meaningful line. He has none of the layered darkness and intrigue of Iron Man 2's villain, or Thor's own Loki.Loki excels in his tightly defined role, but as a side-story he only scores so much screen time. Thor remains well-played but has acclimatised to Earth standard remarkably quickly across his two brief holidays there, lacking any of his brusque viking charm or culture clash from the original.Heimdall is a weak depiction this time around - very much the same character, but with none of the barely-contained, frightening power of his first outing.Asgardians and Svartalfar alike are faceless, masked or helmeted mooks, serving only to die in battles with all the energy and realism of a children's play directed by a nine-year-old Michael Bay.All in all, the film is simply... Dull Hollywood entertainment without any threat, drama, darkness, or intrigue, and all too much comic relief that costs the atmosphere rather than being part of it. The closest it gets to interesting is in its reality-bending gravitational anomalies between worlds, which remind one more of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchise or the classic novel Roadside Picnic than anything else.Odin has been tragically rewritten into an angry, elitist grump even before the plot gives him a reasonable excuse.I'd say avoid this one, much like The Incredible Hulk, and perhaps Captain America.

729,ttg-5,"Chris Hemsworth can't act, but I thought this feature film was okay regardless.",7,18 April 2015,"Disclaimer: This feature film was pretty decent, and the review below will state why. I rated this feature film 7/10 stars because of the following, and the feature films lead actor not being as talented as one should be to be a feature films lead.I enjoyed the Thor movie, and am proud of myself for watching it due to me typically not liking movies with male leads who seemed like they were hired based off of their alleged appearance versus acting skills/ability -- For example: If Thor is supposed to be a massive god then the person hired to play him may have more looks than acting ability on his side and get the part/movie studios are deliberately looking for that.Chris Hemsworth cannot act that well in my opinion, so I will say I was disappointed when it came to that. The movies visuals, plot, other actors, all of their costumes, and ability to keep one like myself paying attention for the length of the movie was way better than his acting. As a result I found myself happy about the film.As far as the visuals go, Asgard was dipped in gold and visually stunning. The movies costumes for the people of Asgard, Thor, the Dark Elves, and a monster called ""Kursed"" were eye catching and cool to look at for the entirety of the film. The stories plot was very easy to digest, and I enjoyed it's simplicity allowing most viewers to follow its story line smoothly.The film has to deal with ""Dark Elves"" wanting to obtain and use something called ""Aether"", to turn the universe into the ""darkness"" it was before it existed/destroy the universe as we know it for all of eternity --allowing them to reign supreme over it once again, as they did before the birth of the universe as we know it now/as it's portrayed in the film. Thor is lured to the movies conflict due to the ""Aether"" hosting itself in Jane Fosters --his mortal love interest-- body during an early point in the movie, and through time learns of the power of it and the cataclysmic results of it getting in the wrong hands. His goal is to prevent the antagonist of the film --Malekith, the main Dark Elf focused on-- from going forward with his cataclysmic plans.All of that is very simple to understand, and for kids, teens, and adults that's something that makes the movie easy for them all to enjoy and experience while being on the same page.With all of those things being said and touched on, I recommend this movie as being one worth seeing on your own time. It was decent enough to me for me to say that. Enjoy, if you decide to view it.",Thor - The Dark World
