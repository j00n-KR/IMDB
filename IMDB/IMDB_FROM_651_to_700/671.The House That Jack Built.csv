0,Horst_In_Translation,"Trier as controversial as ever, if not more",6,19 December 2018,"""The House That Jack Built"" is the newest film release by controversial Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier, in his 60s now, and it is a really long movie at 2.5 hours. After his take on sex in Nymphomaniac, it is all about murder in this one here as we are taken into the world of a serial killer's mind. He is played by Oscar nominee Matt Dillon and in pretty much every scene from start to finish. There are several chapters early on that present to us chronologically how Jack moves from one murder to the next, how he eventually plans to kill several and also how it all began, namely with Thurman's character provoking him. Yep Uma Thurman who from being Tarantino's muse has somewhat moved on to von Trier. She already was a true scene stealer in Nymphomaniac as well and she is almost as good in here early on. Well, this is an extremely violent movie we have here. I will not go much into detail about what you see exactly, but if you are mild-mannered, then skip the watch here. People are graphically murdered in various ways on several occasions throughout the entire film, there is one scene particularly painful when we see the protagonist cut off his lover's breasts. And how macabre it all is we find out later on seeing how he made a purse out of one breast. But maybe what is even more bizarre are the looks of the one boy that he gunned down during the hunting experience. Regardless if it is lovers, children, strangers or old friends he murders, there is never remorse and the main character sure is an evil genius. But the way he (almost) gets caught in the end with the siren is almost a bit too easy, too amateurish for him. Or did he want to die after fulfilling his masterpiece, the full metal jacket sequence? I doubt it, would not have fit the character. You could also wonder to which extent Bruno Ganz' character really exists or if he is all in the mind of the main character only. As we see him walk down to hell in the end, the film feels entirely different compared to everything before that. And not better in my opinion, which is quite a shame because I really adore Ganz and it makes me somewhat sad how old he looks in here. Anyway, he plays the killer's conversation partner from start to end, even if we only hear voiceovers most of the time like he was some kind of psychologist speaking with him. And there is also that recurring argument between them about what makes something art. Is love essential for art? The killer of course says no. He sees himself as an engineer, an architect, but also as an artist and his creation consists of the lives he has been taking. This does not only refer to his secret hideout, but also to other scenes like the crow grave with the mother and two children in the hunting ground I mentioned earlier.The one scene that shocked me the most was certainly when he was clipping of the baby duck's leg mutilating it and I am relieved to see it was not real and just a prop fake leg. Otherwise I would have rated the film considerably lower, but yeah aside from the question if you should let a boy cut off a duck's leg for a movie, I am also glad there is animal protection present in films these days. I am not too shocked this was more disturbing to me than all the pain caused to humans because I knew all of this was staged and fake and nobody was really hurt. But with animals you cannot be too sure, especially as said scene added almost nothing except the common perception that serial killers show destructive tendencies already also in their junior years, but nothing that stands out or so. So yeah, a lot of the violence here feels for the sake of it, but still it is a decent film in my opinion. von Trier sure knows how to entertain and there is definitely not just a sadistic note to the film that will make us smile or even laugh more than we should, but there is some extremely bizarre humor in this film, like for example the scene early on when he tries to get into the widow lady's house and how he turns from police officer to insurance salesman within minutes to succeed. Also liked the reaction from him when he is seen by somebody passing by. Or another somewhat morbidly funny moment later on is when he plays the alcoholic outside tricking the cop into thinking everything is pretty much alright. You will laugh here, maybe even a lot and that is not a given for a LvT movie. What else can I add? Oh yeah, lets not forget that Dillon gives a pretty good performance here and carries the film nicely. He may not be entirely on par with Ganz at the end, but other than that it is absolutely his film and probably not many actors would have given a better portrayal. Physically he is fine for the role too. Apart from that, I think the dialogue writing is very smart constantly and maybe the best thing of the film. I read that audiences left theaters watching this one while others applauded towards the end, but the general reception was not too great it seems. I still enjoyed it though and yeah, even if I gave a rating somewhere in the middle, it is another von Trier work that most people will love or hate. I myself give it a thumbs-up and recommend checking it out, if you think you are capable of stomaching all the excessive violence that is. Yeah it is not as meaningful and deep as it aspires to be a lot of the time, but it does not need to be in order to be a success. Him falling down was also the really right choice for the ending. Speaking about endings, this is where I end my review.",The House That Jack Built
1,claudio_carvalho,Mr. Sophistication,7,2 January 2019,"In the 70´s, the serial-killer Jack (Matt Dillon) is having a conversation with the mysterious Verge (Bruno Ganz) about his murders. Jack, who has obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and the nickname ""Mr. Sophistication"", randomly reports five incidents to show Verge that his murders are artwork. However Verge tells that love is missing in his works to be art. Meanwhile Jack builds and demolishes the house searching for the correct material.""The House That Jack Built' is a creepy story of a serial-killer by Lars von Triers. Matt Dillon is perfectly cast in the role of a serial-killer that needs to clean the crime scene since he has OCD. There some questions without answer but in general it is a good film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil):""A Casa que Jack Construiu"" (""The House That Jack Built"")",The House That Jack Built

Jack is a successful serial killer and a less successful architect. He owns a freezer on Prospect street where he stores the bodies and sometimes poses them for photos. He considers himself an artist to justify his addiction to killing and flipping signs like he is Dylan in"" Subterranean Homesick Blues.""I was bored with the pseudo-intellectual dialogue. Now if they had Bruce Campbell as the lead and lightened things up a bit, maybe a few ""Kill Bill"" innuendos with Uma Thurman on the screen.

3,kosmasp,You don't know Jack,9,7 May 2019,"But that's what this movie is for, right? It is about getting to know Jack and what this abysmal person is about. How he became who he is. Calling him an anti-hero would not really cover it. A powerhouse performance from Dillon and all the other actors involved who mostly are sub-stories themselves. It will be difficult to watch for sure and that is not just because this has a lot of vivid violence included (or at least the aftermath of it), but because of the nature of the movie and the evil core of the main character.But this is also very heightened to the extend that it is also spiritual. The ending might also break the movie for you, but then again, if you swallowed all the other stuff, will this really be a game changer? On the other hand, some might have wanted something different, something easier ... but the movie is not that. And overall that is a good thing - it is not a bluepring on how to behave in life for sure and there is no sympathy left ... but this is very well told and made",The House That Jack Built

6,trashgang,too long and to many conversations,6,31 January 2019,"Due the fuzz at the Cannes festival concerning the viewers and this flick immediately it became a must see. Already knowing that some fuzz is pure publicity (Hereditary for example) others are real.So finally I could pick this up and see what it was all about. And once over I do had mixed emotions. Clocking in over 2 hours is way too long. There are moments that he speaks and speaks with his victim that I really thought, go on, kill her.Further on it's all about a serial killer but knowing Trier it is a arthouse flick. So a lot is explained with footage. Let be the footage the most shocking in this flick. Animals being killed or moments are shown of Nazi's and their concentration camps. The killings itself are okay and in fact it did remind me of Man Bites Dog (1992) and Portrait Of A Serial Killer (1989). But those particular flicks are more brutal. As Man Bites Dog was on the edge of becoming funny even as it was as brutal as hell here we have the same. A few moments I thought, really?Toend, shocking for many I agree but way too long and a lot of conversations that are a bit boring but that made you go into the mind of the serial killer. Not really my cup of tea.

7,deloudelouvain,"Lars von Trier, a name you'll never forget, for better and for worse.",8,9 March 2019,"Since watching Antichrist from 2009 I pledged I would never watch a Lars von Trier movie again, that's how much I absolutely hated that movie. But after years passing by you forget about that pledge and so I tried The House That Jack Built. You can say what you want about Lars von Trier but his movies are very controversial. He has an unique way to bring a story and for that you have to give him credits. The House That Jack Built is again a very special movie, but this time the story was interesting, not like Antichrist that I found utterly boring. This time you have again shocking moments but since the story was captivating they kinda fitted well in the movie. Matt Dillon did a great job playing Jack the serial killer, definitely one of his best acting. The whole movie is about this character and the rest of the cast, even though they did a good job, are just screen filling. The end was very what you can expect from Lars von Trier, a bit chaotic and maybe not the best solution, but this time his movie worked, at least for me. Visually it's all perfect, the story and acting were good, the strangeness a typical signature for a Lars von Trier movie.",The House That Jack Built
8,christopher-underwood,I am a convert,10,28 March 2019,"Fabulous and remarkable film that grabs a hold of the viewer from the very start. Even though this breaks my own little 'Dogma' rules in that a film of over two hours repetition and numbered scenes should be avoided, Lars von Trier asserts his authority and as far as I am concerned holds attention and (unbelievably!) belief until the wondrous and spectacular Dante inspired ending. The performance of Matt Dillon is crucial and his opening scene with Uma Thurman vital to the film's success. As it happens the scene is utter perfection and the varied and mounting degrees of humour, frustration, anger and retribution are all present and ensure that the attentive viewer is sucked in. Brilliant film making and although I have tended to ignore the director in recent years because of length, I am a convert.",The House That Jack Built
9,thesar-2,Henry's Jacked Up Portrait,8,18 July 2020,"I was looking for a New-Neo Western and found a foundation of a killer movie.That was a true story. I was looking for a completely different subgenre of a film and discovered this gem on Hulu. Been wanting to see this for awhile and I was NOT disappointed. I love Hulu because they're not afraid to get the unique movie greats on their service when they're mostly known for TV.Talk about disturbing. So many scenes here...so horrifying, so mesmerizing. So dumb - not the filmmaking but characters, on all sides. You truly can't take your eyes off this. You almost want to root for him, like Hannibal Lecter, but then he pulls some disgusting act...Getting ahead of myself...The House that Jack Built is the building of a serial killer as told in some blank narration between the title character and some unseen interviewer. We're told, and it will come to pass, we're going to hear about 5 incidences in a serial killer's span of ""art."" And I didn't learn to the end, the first incident involves Uma Thurman. That was her?!I digress. You almost feel dirty for following this ""man"" around as he slaughters innocents, innocence and imbeciles, for the most part. Mercifully, the main villain/""protagonist""/title character is played by Matt Dillon who really sold us on his stoic, emotionless killer who may/may not want to be caught.To be honest, despite this coming out in 2018, but is set in the 1970s/1980s, I would've never ever believed he would encounter such stupid victims as he does in this movie if not for the turmp years. Not to be political, and I'm trying not to show sides here, turmp's (yes, purposely spelled wrong and uncapitalized because he cares so much for his name - okay, fine, I did cross the line) America, many stoopid people have come out of their rinky-dink closets. So, this movie is definitely plausible as this killer stalks brain dead citizens.Full disclaimer: this is an artsy movie. It's purposely slow and shows many images of ""Look What I Can Do!"" to reach the viewer. For the most part, I could ignore those scenes as they were too obvious. I was interested in the narrative and see where this was headed. Sadly, it didn't have the best of endings, but the 95% leading up to was worthy of a viewing.Just be careful. As the other Jack, the head of the Behavioral Science Unit of the FBI, Mr. Crawford, from the brilliant The Silence of the Lambs once said: ""Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head. Just do your job, but never forget what he is.""Oh, sorry. Have you forgotten yet? He's a monster.***Final thoughts: I HOOOOOPE the scene with the duckling was fake. I looked away just as it happened, but that looked really real. I've seen movies that actually killed animals for the sake of art, and I never forgave movies for doing that. I just hope this one was fiction. Not sure what I'm referring to? SEE my words above: ""Talk about disturbing. So many scenes here...so horrifying, so mesmerizing...""",The House That Jack Built
10,MOscarbradley,A serial killer movie like no other.,8,29 December 2019,"You know that a Lars von Trier serial killer movie is unlikely to be like anyone else's serial killer movie; that it is most likely to be more gruesome and perhaps even with a streak of very black humour and ""The House that Jack Built"" certainly doesn't disappoint. What we might not have guessed was that it would take the form of a dialogue between our serial killer, Jack, (a never better Matt Dillon), and some Stygian boatman who is probably rowing him all the way to Hades, (Bruno Ganz. perfectly cast).When it was shown at Cannes a number of critics walked out. Why? Could they really have been so sensitive or did they just want to punish von Trier for even showing up? Certainly no-one could deny that as serial killer movies go this one is highly original; you might even call it pretentious but then you'd be missing the joke or could that have been the reason for those walk-outs? Serial killers aren't supposed to be funny.Using animation, paintings and newsreels to illustrate Jack's 'career' von Trier goes his own way as usual and the von Trier way is, as we know, both shocking and disturbing in ways other director's films simply aren't. If you want to see a 'thriller', forget it but if you want to get inside the head of one crazily inventive outsider, (von Trier, who else), then this is the one for you.",The House That Jack Built
11,dromasca,anatomy of evil,8,14 July 2021,"I have a proposal for those who have not yet seen 'The House That Jack Built', Lars von Trier's latest film (2018). Try to forget who the director is. I know it's not easy, because we are dealing with a person and a personality who provokes and shocks, who seeks and attracts scandals and who knows that advertising is best when it's bad. My opinion, after watching this film to which the 2018 Cannes Film Festival scheduled only a premiere out of competition, is that the attitudes and reactions triggered by this film are much more extreme than the film itself. It is a dissection and a psychological analysis of a serial killer, developed with effusion over two and a half hours of screening, but I did not find in this film anything that would shock me more than what I experienced for example at the screenings of 'The Silence of the Lambs' or 'Zodiac' and the graphic visual details do not exceed what we saw in the countless films in the series 'Scream', 'Halloween' or 'Elm Street', not to mention the violent and psychological intensity of the films of Tarantino, Lanthimos or von Trier himself. Whoever manages to separate this film from the advertising shell of the image that the director is trying to build to himself will have many reasons for cinematic satisfaction.Von Trier assumes in 'The House That Jack Built' the risk of describing five episodes of the blood and corpse-laden journey of a serial killer. At one point, Jack, the hero of the film, played by Matt Dillon, confesses to his future victim that he committed 60 murders and is about to commit the 61st. One of the messages of the film may be that one should believe the statements of those who confess to criminal inclinations and bloody sins. Why is von Trier a special case? Other directors who have approached such themes and characters have not faced similar dangers, but von Trier has made enough other extreme films (but also some sublime ones) as well as shocking statements, so that when he speaks evil we may be tempted to believe him. Jack's travel partner in the film is most of the time a voiceover borrowed from Bruno Ganz, that of a character named Verge, who receives Jack's confessions and forces him to look for the roots of the deeds he commits. Is there any possible justification? Is there any other alternative end to this journey than in one of the hottest circles of Hell?Matt Dillon succeeds to create in 'The House That Jack Built' one of the best roles of his career confirming the statistics that make the roles of psychotic criminals career peaks for the actors who play them. Bruno Ganz - in one of his last roles, he would die less than a year after the premiere of this film - creates an excellent counter-character in Verge, and the use of off-screen dialogue between the two is in this case perfectly justified. Lars von Trier copiously uses the collage technique by inserting animation, sequences from his own films, documentary sequences (including with characters embodying the evil that Hitler and Mussolini) and musical sequences such as those with pianist Glenn Gould. The original music and the soundtrack belong to Víctor Reyes and the cinematography to Manuel Alberto Claro, the faithful director of cinematography of von Trier for more than a decade. The America described by von Trier (who has never visited the North American continent) is perfectly believable, the realism of the scenes amplifying the horror effect. The combination of sophisticated references, core dialogue, psychological analysis of the character on the one hand and his behaviour on the screen on the other hand can be confusing and shocking, but it is interesting and asks questions that seem legitimate to me about how evil can be represented on screen. Anyone who knows von Trier's films understands that he rarely compromises. This is not the case here either and in my opinion the balance is clearly positive.",The House That Jack Built

I won't spoil anything, but the movie is about serial killer, and the way he does his ""thing"" was disturbing for me. And make no mistake, this a movie by L.V.

Something we are attracted to yet repulsed by & often choose to ignore. But, to the credit of the producers it is a look inside the mind of one type of serial killer in an art film sardonic sort of way.

18,tomgillespie2002,A stand-in for von Trier's self-satisfied smirk,4,7 January 2019,"Seven years ago, Danish provocateur Lars von Trier found himself banned from the Cannes Film Festival after making a rather ill-timed joke about sympathising with Hitler during a press conference for Melancholia. For a festival that seems to inspire walk-outs and boos from audiences who have apparently never seen a film before, it was never going to be too long until von Trier wriggled his way back in. After all, for a director famous for clitoris-removal and the mocking of disabled people, the lure of free advertising from appalled cinema-goers would surely be too strong to resist. For his return, von Trier brought The House That Jack Built, a two and half hour serial killer movie that often feels like a stand-in for the director's self-satisfied smirk. Not only does the film feature animal cruelty, infanticide and open mocking of the #MeToo movement, but the anti-hero at its centre talks frequently at length about his real obsession. You guessed it: the Third Reich. This is a giant middle-finger to the Cannes board.Jack (Matt Dillon) is a serial killer who, by the end, boasts more than 60 victims. He mainly kills women, but he also kills men and children if the subject is just right for his unique brand of 'art'. At the start of the film, he discusses his life and the nature of evil with an unseen man, played by Bruno Ganz, who we don't see until the very end. He defends his grisly past-times as artistic expression, claiming that everyone who died at his hands will be forever immortalised in his work. His story is recounted as a series of incidents, the first of which involves Uma Thurman as an impossibly stupid victim stranded by the road-side. Convincing Jack to give her a ride to a nearby garage that can fix her car jack, she almost talks the stranger into killing her, even handing him the murder weapon. When the brutal, sudden murder occurs, we almost feel a sense of relief. You can imagine von Trier stroking his chin and grinning at the thought of us feeling like she deserved it. Over the course of a decade, Jack ponders his favourite kills, taking the occasional detour to discuss architecture, literature and the work of Glenn Gould, and to repeatedly build and knock down his dream house.For a film that understandably caused outrage at its premiere, The House That Jack Built isn't gory and full of spatter, but that isn't to say the film isn't frequently repugnant. An old lady is strangled to death for comic effect, a duckling has its leg snipped off, and worst of all, a child's corpse is contorted with wires and preserved in Jack's walk-in freezer, positioned in the background of many scenes just in case we happen to forget. Such blatant button-pushing would be forgivable, of even admirable, had this trudging vanity project been remotely convincing. Instead, its two and a half hours that feels two and a half hours, with a miscast Dillon delivering monologues on the beauty of genocide and the evolution of architecture while von Trier plans his next trick to make you feel uncomfortable. The film's best performance is delivered by Riley Keough as a young woman Jack cruelly names Simple. Jack toys with her low self-esteem before dispatching her in a horrendous manner, but there's real humanity lurking in this scene, and a real sense of dread conjured up by von Trier. The whole thing is almost saved by a climactic journey through a Hell seemingly inspired by the covers of death metal albums, which manages to be both truly eerie and cartoonishly comical. But then you remember what you had to get through to get there, and wonder how to get your 150 minutes back.",The House That Jack Built
19,Thanos_Alfie,Not good...,4,3 January 2019,"""The House That Jack Built"" is a Crime - Horror movie in which we watch a highly intelligent person who has Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) trying to handle his nerves. We watch him over a span of 12 years as he starts his murders and becoming a serial killer. As the police get closer and closer to him he starts taking greater risks, he does that because since he creates artworks with each one of his murders, he believes that the greater the risk the better the artwork.Since I didn't have high expectations from this movie I wasn't let down by it. I didn't like this movie because it had a boring plot with some humorous moments and nothing more. The direction which was made by Lars von Trier was a bit predictable if you have watched some other movies of his like ""Antichrist"", ""Melancholia"" or ""Nymphomaniac vol.1/2"". He wanted to present this movie so philosophical or even humorous but I believe that he lost it somewhere in the very beginning and since this movie is more than two hours you can understand what happened. The only good from this movie was the interpretation of Matt Dillon who played as Jack and he was simply outstanding. I believe that he made his best interpretation until now.To sum up, I have to say that ""The House That Jack Built"" isn't a good movie, it has a decent plot and the idea of this movie is very good but becomes very boring movie due to a poor direction. If you are a fan of Lars von Trier and his movies then I am sure that you are going to love this movie and rate it with eight to ten, but if you aren't and you expect a classic horror movie then don't bother watching it.",The House That Jack Built
20,TheMovieDiorama,The House That Jack Built provocatively applicates bloody ligaments as a foundation for artistic philosophy.,7,12 March 2020,"Dante Alighieri's 'Divine Comedy', 'Inferno'. A journey into the diabolical descent of hell, with concentric circles depicting the sins of torment. Lust. Greed. Wrath. Gluttony. Heresy. Layers of transgressive retribution that reap the souls of those suffering its torturous methods. Dante's Inferno, along with Purgatorio and Paradiso, are heralded as works of art. One of the greatest pieces of world literature, inspired by the theology and ideology of Thomistic philosophy. An epic poem allegorically representing the human soul, artistically embellishing moral principles. Art educates. Art guides. Art inspires. Its igniting iconography beckoning the most simplistic of powers that both intimidate and stimulate. Fascism. Communism. Christianity. Humanity surrounds itself in symbolic art. Why? Do images represent more ideals than literature? Do masterpieces evoke cultural significance? While these all apply, the answer is far simpler. Art transcends time.Von Trier, arguably the most provocative auteur in cinema today, assimilates that ethos by likening the depiction of Inferno to a psychopathic serial killer. Jack, with all his artistic constitutions, murders an ill-mannered woman whom rudely demanded her vehicle be repaired. Jack, ironically, slaughters her with a jack, stores her body in a freezer and rapidly unleashes a pessimistic perspective upon the world. Narratively constructed through five pivotal incidents and an epilogue, von Trier crafts a titillating psychological horror that endeavours to illustrate insight into the mind of a serial killer and provide political subtext apt for today's violent society. Without revealing the core contents of Jack's illicit shenanigans, this feature truly is a gruesome ordeal meant to polarise its audience. The unsettling imagery, from homemade breast removals to shooting children at a hunting range, and audacious editing are purposefully manufactured to provoke. It's two and a half hour runtime is solely built to exasperate, yet provide an equally stimulating message.Each incident that von Trier bravely embeds, heightens the characterisation of Jack as a serial killer. The realistic charming anonymity he presides in, as he lures unknowing women to his spacious red van, produces a perceptive antagonistic aura that almost feels existent. A contagious allurement that turns this sadistic creature into an approachable human. Charismatically, Jack is portrayed by Dillon whom of which returns to the screen with an outrageously deceptive performance harking back to Bale's universally acclaimed role in 'American Psycho'. The tongue-in-cheek delivery of von Trier's dialogue grants an ostentatious yet equally personable appeal to Jack, and that's without mentioning Dillon's stoically creepy posture and mannerisms. Small details such as the analysis of OCD during a murder and psychopathic insight into political undertones, especially with lines such as ""Nobody wants to help!"". Dare I say, Dillon makes a scarily pragmatic serial killer? Well, I've said it now!The real cusp of ingenuity though, exudes from Ganz' narration, whom portrays an incarnation of the poet Virgil. In between each incident, Jack and ""Verge"" philosophise certain theories as to why Jack slaughtered all his victims. Almost resembling a confession scenario. However, it's Verge's neutrality when interrogating Jack that provides evocative meaning to the purpose of von Trier's polarising methods. For example, querying Jack's superiority as he murders women who ""strike him as seriously unintelligent"". It explores the mind of a deranged soul in a creative religious light.However, much like art itself, its contents borders on pretentiousness. The violent incidents themselves are filmed with enough panache to elevate the simplistic material. The conversations that link them together, edited with embedded clips of contemporary instructional paintings (the architecture of cathedrals, shadows of pain between lamp posts etc.) and images of acclaimed paintings to symbolise cultural impact upon modern society, are rarely subtle. They are, incredibly, aggressive. Both in nature and in execution. Bowie's 'Fame' and the repetitious depiction of farmers scything in a synchronous manner were effective once. To consistently repeat the same motive, which consequently diminishes the allegorical violence, proved to be ineffective and most importantly pretentious. The greatest masterpieces transcend time due to the finer details. Subtlety is everything. The brutality against women also exceeded its stay, with graphic scenes conveying Jack's supposedly superior masculinity. As a side note, the third incident involving a family at a hunting range was distasteful. Oh, and the duckling. Granted, these are personal qualms, but mentioned regardless for those cautious by such controversial imagery.As uncompromising as Dante's Inferno, The House That Jack Built constructed an unsettling link between infamous iconography and guilt-free violence. Satirising audacious ordeals by injecting vivid dialogue that welcomes sadism. Whilst von Trier may have overstepped the mark on several occasions and pretentiously inundated the film in authoritarian commentary, its shock factor will evoke your inner perversive side. Or, you'll plunge the depths of hell trying to retrieve lost time. Polarising art as always from von Trier! Wouldn't have it any other way...",The House That Jack Built
21,Tweetienator,Not So Good Not So Bad,6,19 December 2018,"I don't know, the acting is good to very good and also everything else is well made and thought thru but somehow The House That Jack Built never got me, most of the time I was slightly bored, and some of the ""blabla"" between the murders did not really inflame my mind but rather felt like an artificial attempt of ""pimping up"" a rather blunt story. Maybe its me, I am rather fed up with all the Hannibal Lectors of this world and I just can enjoy stories of serial killers truly if spiced up with lots of gore and horror.A masterpiece like some reviewers state!? I don't believe so - Melancholia was an excellent experience for me (one of the very rare movies depression is really well portrayed - of course, excellent played by Kirsten Dunst, and the rather surreal turning of the story didn't feel artificial at all), but this one I guess I will forget rather quickly, but it is certainty not a bad one too.",The House That Jack Built
22,videorama-759-859391,THE GREAT SK FILM THAT LARS MADE,9,14 March 2019,"Lars Von Trier has done it again. This was truly an eye gaging and pensive movie experience, as we really go into the recesses of a depraved serial killer, in what could be one of the greatest serial killer films ever made, well original, any way. This two and a half hour blood fest, though not excessive, because a shock testing movie, carried by one great performance by Dillon, who truly grabs his unhinged character by the horns, and really makes the film deliciously fun, and his OCD attachment, though kind of irritating, I liked.
I've always considered Dillon a good actor, who's never dropped his level of performance. He''s one of the most talented young actors, I've seen since the 80's, but his performance here, is the cherry on the top of all his others. He's truly creepy, and will have you writhing, or shifting some in your seat, mostly in forewarning of his atrociously murderous actions, about to follow. This great movie goes too far in one breast slashing scene, kind of putting a despoiling or ridiculously stupid touch on it, like they now do in a lot gory R films, DeathWish last year, another example, which I saw exactly a year before, to the letter, where a car was dropped, by a revenge fuelled Wiilis, and a guys intestines flew out. Breast sized wallet has a new meaning too, in extention to the breast slashing scene, replayed twice too. Siobian's death was the most shocking scene, as to her eventual physical state, after kissing miles of bitumin. THTJB does draw many resemblences of filmmaking style as of his former one, Nymphomaniac, and that's not a criticism. Also a little bit of Breaking The Waves in this too, which I still consider his superior one. I love how this film really gets to evaluate Dillon's character, as his perceptions, in fantastically perceptively written dialogue, relative, and mostly innocently telegraphed images between, of course not the first movie to do this. Think back to Natural Born Killers, and this movie's a long way from that. Uma Thurman, a much underused actress now, saddens me, as to only now see her in Lars Von Trier's films. The last twelve to 15 minutes of this film involving our killer Jack's fate, is originality and inventiveness at it's finest, and like Nymphomaniac, a lot of care and thought has gone into this film. Actual Serial Killers would understand this film the best. This movie's an ode to serial killer, and a high reccomendation from me. Child and Animals Murder themes, may offend. Just saying this as a pre warning. A highly creative and thought provoking, not to mention, challenging watch, from a guy who knows how to make movies, and richly entertain. And the house metaphorically speaks volumes too.",The House That Jack Built
23,jtindahouse,"A tough watch, yet a rewarding one if you're capable",8,1 May 2019,"From what I could gather about 'The House That Jack Built' before seeing it it was basically an ultra-violent, thriller/horror arthouse film. Those films have been very hit and miss over the years for me. 'The Eyes of My Mother' is one of my favourite horror films of all time for example. Others that were similar I have hated. Seeing that 'The House That Jack Built' was 2 and a half hours long had me a little skeptical because if I wasn't enjoying it then it was going to be a very long ride. Luckily though I did enjoy it.It was a film that I enjoyed more and more as it went along. At first it seemed very choppy, uneven and pointless. Then as it went along it began to gather a flow and became extremely watchable. This was actually my first ever Lars von Trier film. I know he does some pretty out there stuff but I had never actually seen any of it. I suspect for the most part this film is about as normal as it gets for him.My favourite part of the film was actually the 'epilogue'. It had me hooked. I literally couldn't take my eyes of the screen. It was crafted brilliantly and had me thinking about it long after the credits rolled. The credit song was also an outstanding choice.This is not a film for the faint-hearted by any means. Almost every scene is extremely dark and disturbing and some of the individual moments along the way are bordering on unwatchable. If you can stomach it though I think most will have a great time with this film. I know I did.",The House That Jack Built
24,billcr12,Ouch,8,16 April 2019,"Melancholia was a rather silly film with an absurd Kirsten Dunst relieving herself on a lawn while wearing a wedding dress. All is forgiven for Lars Von Trier. This time around we have Matt Dillon as a philosophical serial killer who dispatches men and women with alarming efficiency. The script is both sick and funny at the same time. The director has a field day with the emotions of the audience on a roller coaster ride of humor and violence. I have not had so much fun since my favorite film, A Clockwork Orange. Those who appreciate Kubrick's masterpiece will surely enjoy an updated Alex in Dillon's modern day murderer. Matt is a whirlwind as a man inspired by such individuals as the Ice Man, Richard Kuklinski. Lar's world is an extremely dark and uncaring one. This ain't Marry Poppins and no one will live happily ever after. The ending is a good one with our hero encountering a nether world which must be seen to be believed. The House That Jack Built is one of the best films of the year.",The House That Jack Built
25,jadavix,Far better on second viewing,8,30 December 2018,"Having just re-watched ""The House That Jack Built"", I have changed my opinion of the movie. At first I gave it five stars, finding it boring and uninvolving. That was totally unlike my recent second viewing.I believe in the first place I had found Dillon unbelievable as a serial killer. I'm now not sure how I could have come to that conclusion. Dillon's performance really started to get under my skin during my second viewing. He's an actor who always seems to ooze untrustworthiness anyway. Here he is a pathological liar in addition to a murderer, and what is terrifying about the character is the way he is an endless resource of lie. Take the scene where he cons his way into a woman's house, for example, and actually changes his story several times during the conversation, which is of course more like a monologue. You never get the sense that the woman even believes him; she finally gives in due to the exhausting weight of this man's B. S.Dillon finding that note to play the role with was genius.I also appreciated Bruno Ganz more here than I did last time. A conversation between two erudite people at the centre of the movie obviously invited comparisons with von Trier's previous ""Nymphomaniac"". I still don't think the conversations are quite as interesting here, but I found they related more to Jack's activities than I previously mentioned, and were less irritating abstraction.I'm still not crazy about the ending, however, but at least I was able to come up with an explanation for it this time.",The House That Jack Built

27,arthur_tafero,Good Try But No CIgar - The House That Jack Built,4,24 July 2020,"The problem here is that there is no suspense; you already know what's going to happen in almost every incident except the first one. The film had a good start with the talented Uma Thurman making the first fifteen minutes very interesting. But, unfortunately, the film descends into a predictable pattern despite the good direction of Lars, one of the best. This is pretty much due to two fatal flaws; the acting of Matt Dillon; who is not really believable as a con man/killer. A killer maybe; but not a con man. The other fatal weakness is the writing; which although trying to copy the Coen Brothers chemical formula, fails to do so. It lacks the class of American Psycho or the intensity of Zodiac. It is rather a dumb movie about a dumb man who does dumb things in the name of art. It had possibililies, but they were never realized.",The House That Jack Built
28,drownnnsoda,"Another dark odyssey from Lars von Trier, for better or for worse",8,26 April 2020,"""The House That Jack Built"" follows a serial killer (Matt Dillon) who recounts a number of murders throughout his decade-long ""career"" as a serial killer to Virgil (the Roman poet) as Virgil guides him through the nine circles of hell, in Dante's Inferno-fashion.I have followed Lars von Trier's career for two decades now, and have always found his films challenging in some way, and this one is no exception--that being said, it's probably his most straightforward and narratively amusing work to date. As is the case with von Trier, the film is divided into chapters, each detailing one of the titular Jack's murders in Washington state in the 1980s. There are obvious shades of Ted Bundy here, some more blatant than others, but ""The House That Jack Built"" is far from your typical serial killer film.The segments feature commentary from Jack and Virgil, and are interspersed between diatribes from Jack (in voiceover) in which he attempts to give a rationale for his ""life's work""--murder--as a grand artistic masterpiece. Many have speculated that Jack is an analog for von Trier himself, making an argument for his life's work--a career making unequivocally controversial films. This is a fairly clear double-meaning that is injected into the film, but where it takes an unusual spin is in its ultimate treatment of Jack--though the protagonist, he is not really an antihero, and he's certainly not a hero.Each of the five flashback segments detail specific murders Jack committed, and are laid out in true von Trier fashion with a cold, clinical presentation. The camera does not shy away from the most uncomfortable moments (violence or no violence), and each segment is shot through with tar-black humor that mitigates (to some degree) the calculated nature of the violence that takes place. Matt Dillon's performance is appropriately cynical and icy, while the various prey-Siobhan Hogan, Uma Thurman, Riley Keough-manage to wring the humor out of von Trier's script while still maintaining a sense of perceived danger.The ending of the film is, as many have noted, over-the-top, but it does allow for some poetic justice that, if absent, would render the film an absolute nosedive into nihilism. Having seen many of von Trier's previous films, I was surprised that he chose to end it the way he did--though, by the same token, his selection of the conclusion could be as much a tongue-in-cheek joke as anything else. This is part of what makes his films fascinating and challenging: The audience never quite knows where he is landing from moment to moment. That being said, ""The House That Jack Built"" is surely not a rationale for murder, though it may indeed be a grand, self-reflexive metaphor for its creator himself. In any event, it is one hell (no pun intended) of a ride.",The House That Jack Built

30,TdSmth5,"Not that great for a Von Trier movie, despite strong moments",7,14 April 2019,"Two guys are talking. It sounds like one person is confessing or getting therapy. As often in movies one person will say that he's heard it all, that nothing will shock him, the other person of course goes ahead with the story thinking it will shock the other. The one guy, Jack will tell Verge about 5 incidents in his life. The first involves him driving in his van and stopping for a stranded woman. She's got a flat and her jack is broken. He reluctantly agrees to drive her to a shop to have the jack fixed. Right away the woman asks him if he's a serial killer, and starts talking about what would happen if he were, how he could dispose of her body without anyone knowing and so on. She's also arrogant and treats him like crap. After a couple of trips, Jack's had it and slams the jack into her skull. He's got a hideout of sorts on a street with a partial street name sign. There he's got a freezer with old pizzas. There's another door in the freezer that he can't open and never has made a serious attempt to open.We learn that Jack in an engineer who thinks of himself as an architect. His goal and greatest expression of freedom is building a house for himself, a project he starts repeatedly only to have it torn down quickly after.He then shows up at some woman's door pretending to be a cop. But she doesn't buy it. Then he switches stories claiming to be an insurance guy who can offer her a larger pension. Now she lets him in. Eventually he strangles her. As he's about to leave the scene with the body a cop shows up but Jack manages to talk his way out of it and drives away dragging the body behind his car.At some point he runs over a woman. At that point in the story, Verge asks about love. Then Jack tells him about an episode where he takes his girlfriend and her two children hunting. And he ends up hunting all three down. At some point he starts taking pictures of his victims in weird positions. Then the talk turns to art. He starts sending the photos to police signing as ""Mr. Sophistication."" Verge insists on bringing up love.So Jack tell him about another girlfriend he had, someone he called ""simple"" because he thought of her as dumb. one night when he starts getting all weird, she make a run for it, runs into the police, but again, Jack talks his way out of it. She screams but no one cares. And she actually, despite supposedly being the dumb one, identifies him as the serial killer Mr. Sophistication.After a talk with Verge about WWII, he devises a plan and device to kill a bunch of people with a single bullet. He's got a bunch of guys bound and locked up in his freezer. But now his luck starts to run out. He needs a full metal jacket round, but got something else in the box he bought so he's back to the gun store but this time the clerk gets suspicious and wants to see some ID. Jack storms off to a hunter friend, who realizes he's responsible for some robberies (?) and calls the cops. A cop arrives, Jack kills him takes the cop car and drives back to his freezer sirens blazing. Because he needs more distance for his shot, he finally decides to open the other locked door only to find...Verge sitting there. Attracted by the sirens, police finally make it to the place and try to break in. With the help of Verge, Jack finally builds the house of his dreams. But then things turn weird.One person telling another about her life is reminiscent of Nymphomaniac. And a lot of other parts of this movie will make reference to Von Trier's previous movies. There's even a collage of scenes near the end. The House That Jack Built is hardly the brilliant movie people say it is, nor is it as terrible as other claims. It's somewhere in the middle. It's not shocking, brutal, or all that funny. Sure there are parts that could be and should be these. But the tone of the movie is so flat that these lost their effect entirely. Of course that's part of Von Trier's style. But here, all the talk, Verge's voice, the length of the movie, and Verge's employment of seduction 101 techniques of using the other person's name 3 times per sentence got on my nerves and numbed me pretty much go the entire movie. And neither is Jack the highly intelligent serial killer of the descriptions. On the contrary, I found him pretty dumb but with a ton of luck. There's indeed some social criticism as well but it nothing to get too excited about. I had to see this movie in two sessions because I got tired and bored of it after a while.Now, yes, there are some intelligent things said, but consider this movie is more than 2 and half hours of talk. It would have been outrageous had nothing interesting been said at all. Even more so since Von Trier tends to have didactic moments in his movies, he does research about something then his characters start explaining things. There's stuff here about hunting, WWII, psychology, art. Particularly interesting to me was to the whole issue of art in relation to death/ a serial killer because art is one of those things some people think that everything should be sacrificed for, in the extreme case even life, or rather the lives of others. But as Verge explains, art turning against life is a contradiction and an aberration. And yet it happens. So it is neat that you have characters actually explaining themselves (even using illustrations) as opposed to 99% of movies where no one has anything to say about anything except the typical baloney self-esteem-boosting Hollywood lines. But in a movie this long it wears you down. Not to mention that in the ending Von Trier goes against the script and nearly sacrifices the entire movie for the sake of borderline non-sensical art. Missing for me was also the more characteristic, interesting, and funny signature Von Trier editing style, in that regard this movie is more conventional. Overall, I have a hard time recommending this movie because it's so dull and the parts that should be thrilling are filmed in a dull way as well. Yes it is worth watching, but this could have been a much stronger movie had he filmed this in a different stage in his life, say after producing the brilliant The Kingdom.",The House That Jack Built
31,I_Ailurophile,Disturbing yet fascinating,9,6 July 2021,"'The house that Jack built' might be the most unique and artistic portrayal of a serial killer ever committed to film. If there are better examples, I'd be rather curious to see them.Matt Dillon is fantastic, giving what is surely one of the best performances of his career as he portrays the title character with a cold menace that belies an unexpectedly wide range of emotion. That range is limited by Jack's obvious psychopathy, but he's not the typical serial killer, and this isn't the typical movie about a serial killer. For the extraordinary lack of risk or consequence that Jack faces throughout the film, the astounding ignorance of those he encounters, and certainly not least of all the underlying thrust of the narrative, the movie feels a lot like a fairy tale.Of course, that notion could also be chalked up to Jack's role as an unreliable narrator. The film consists mostly of flashbacks to several of Jack's murders, interposed with a variety of images, clips, and animations relating to specific concepts used to describe them. We see all this as Jack waxes poetic about his aptitude for death, speaks of his murders as a form of art, and philosophizes and otherwise converses tirelessly with a guide, ""Verge."" Their unseen trek is realized visually late in the movie, cementing a highly fantastical element that at once risks our suspension of disbelief but also neatly fits the narrative slant. Until then, the persistent audio exchange between Jack and Verge is entertaining, and engrossing.As weirdly entrancing as the dialogue voiceover is, the visual depiction of Jack's legacy is both gripping and horrific in its monstrousness. The ""second incident"" goes so sideways, revealing another aspect of Jack's person, that it nearly becomes a sick comedy of errors, yet that instance of relative levity stands alone. It's surrounded on all sides by shocking violence, including animal cruelty; oddly casual discussion of genocide; intense misogyny; and a glaring revelation of the broad, cruel indifference of ordinary people. This is a film about a serial killer, yes - told from his perspective - but these things should disturb us, and do.Throughout it all, Lars von Trier's ingenious screenplay gives star Matt Dillon, and even mostly unseen dialogue partner Bruno Ganz (""Verge""), considerable leeway to inhabit their roles and express deceptively complex characterizations. The wit and intelligence of his writing is brought to vivid life in his direction that makes every scene feel very real. No less essential is the sharp editing from Molly Malene Stensgaard and Jacob Secher Schulsinger, keenly stitching together every detailed shot in Jack's flashbacks, to say nothing of the varied imagery in the interstitial segments.I find myself surprised. I sat to watch 'The house that Jack built' knowing nothing substantive of it, and with no real expectations. The construction of the film is decidedly unconventional compared to most pictures, though certainly meshing with the deeply artistic style von Trier is known for. Early scenes are so jarring in their craft that I felt unsure of what I was getting into, but the vision solidifies quickly, allowing us to soak in the violent yet captivating exploration of the killer's mind. I don't know if ""fun"" is quite the right word, but it's definitely a terrific ride.Between von Trier's approach to film-making and especially the difficult and often grotesque content, this is by no means a picture that will find favor with all audiences. For anyone open to a wide range of forms, though, 'The house that Jack built' is outstanding in its craft, and altogether fascinating - and highly recommended.",The House That Jack Built
32,AudioFileZ,A Serial Killer's Descent Into Degrees of Hell,7,16 December 2018,"The House That Jack Built uses the mounting deaths Jack commits as building something that is an extension of himself. It kind of has a path of giving in to an unnatural desire to full-on fantasies involving corps. It's really pretty sick and dark. In this I think the movie gets the depravity of a deranged unconscionable person who is deeper and deeper into his obsession over a period of years.Matt Dillon is definitely up to portraying a creep who is on the surface attempting to be a kind of deep intelligent killer, but is a mad empty vessel. He gets both across which is important for a story such as this to hang. The movie straddles the gore for cheap shock (i.e. not all as believable as the movie alludes) with the believable. Mostly you accept in spite of his chance taking ridiculousness Jack just continues the ""descent"" he is on. Actually it seems to be part of the story that society doesn't shut him down sooner?I think the film does finally take a turn that is creative and unexpected. It has a final sequence in which Jack is being condemned not in a court of law. This separates the film further. This is not just another serial killer film, it is not a wanna be mind game like Seven, it is uniquely it's own. Matt Dillon is, at times, a bit too natural in this Jack character and that is unsettling it itself. The film is filmed in a kind of voyeuristic way of Jack being interviewed and explaining his actions. Add it all up for that unique thing I think the director was going for and, mostly, hits. That is what makes it worth a watch.",The House That Jack Built
33,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Flawed but Haunting Film,8,23 December 2018,"This was a film that I was turned on to by the news that people walked out during its screening at the Cannes Film Festival. I actually wrote a news article about this and personally was a little bit skeptical about it. I was still intrigued to see what this film was all about. The official synopsis is the story follows Jack (Matt Dillon), a highly intelligent serial killer, over the course of twelve years, and depicts the murders that really develop his inner madman.We kick off with hearing talking with a black screen. One of the voices is Jack while the other is that of Verge (Bruno Ganz). It appears they are traveling somewhere and during this journey, Jack is telling the stories of 5 murders he committed that really shaped who he is.The first one is of Uma Thurman. She is a woman who asks for his help when she has a flat tire. She is loud woman who is talking about serial killers and bullying Jack around. He finally snaps and kills her. I am taking this as his first murder, but the film shows us glimpses of him as a boy, where it seems like his nature into what he grows into.From here we see other woman that he murders and in-between each story, we learn more about Jack's past and more insights into him as a person. The more he kills, the more depraved he becomes. To make things worse, he has horrible Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and believes he is making art in what he is doing. Everything takes a turn when he tries to complete his greatest work yet, but can he before everything tumbles down.This recap was a little difficult to do, because part of it is that you really need to see and experience a lot of what happens in the film. I didn't really want to spoil things either. There is a lot to unravel in this film as it runs for two and half hours. I will say that if you like serial killer films, this one is quite interesting. It does have a feel of Dexter in that we are getting a lot of narration from Jack as he tells us the things he did. I personally enjoy that, but I know some people might not.Being this film is about a serial killer, I did find it interesting all of things that are incorporated into the character that match up with what a lot of real serial killers had going on. One of them being that Jack is attractive. He is quite smart; he has issues as a child where he would hurt animals. As stated above, he has OCD and he also mimics being a police officer at one point. This attention to detail was something I really thought was good.Something else I really enjoyed about the story is seeing the change in his character. We are getting him telling us this story, but we are actually seeing him as he becomes worse. It is odd that he is the killer in this film, but at some scenes, I was hoping that he wouldn't get caught. I was thinking to myself that I shouldn't be thinking this way, but the film presents it in such a way and he has such charisma that it was hard not to.There is also the issue of religion in this film. The epilogue really delves into this, but I won't get into that. I will say that Verge has a direct representation with this though. It is interesting that fairly early in the film, Jack states that he is an atheist. He does believe there is almost divine intervention though that allows him to get away with things. As I also said as well, the ending really delves into this much more.Something else that I could see a lot of people being upset about is the misogyny in the film. I don't necessarily this film is misogynistic though. I do believe that Jack is and I also believe that is another common trait among serial killers. The film actually calls Jack out on this aspect and I don't even think the female victims are stupid. I think there's the realism that you don't know what is happening until it is too late.I will say that this film did have some pacing issues with me. I think the problem is that the film is too long. There is quite a bit that could have been cut out to tighten this film up. There are a lot of things that are repeated a couple of times that wasn't really needed. We get some talk about art, architecture and engineering that doesn't really go anywhere. I think that could have been removed to tighten this up. With that said though, I really dug the ending and where it went. I thought it was an interesting idea to use in this film.From here I will go to the acting, which was amazing. Dillon did a phenomenal job as Jack. I think his look, how he plays the role and everything was perfect for it. As mean as it is to probably say, I could see him actually being this guy if he wanted to. Ganz is quite interesting in this film. We don't see him until the ending, but I really like what his character represents. Thurman, Siobhan Fallon Hogan, Sofie Gråbøl and Riley Keough were all good as the victims. It was interesting to see Keough topless as well. The rest of the cast round out the film for what they needed as well.Something else that was great was the effects in the film. This was something that I was curious about as I knew a lot of people were upset about this part of the film. They were done practically, so the amount of realism that went into them definitely is a part of it. I don't even think this is the most violent Lars von Trier film I've ever seen. There was one that really got to me, but I would say the effects were really good.Now with that said, I thought this was a good film. There are the makings of a great film here, but I think that there are just some minor missteps. I thought the story was great as well as the acting and the effects. There are some darker aspects to the story I liked. I think that the pacing would have been better if just some of the unneeded things were removed from it. As it is, I think that it hurts the flow a bit. The score of the film really didn't stand out to me, aside from them using David Bowie's Fame. I did happen to really enjoy that. I did have to watch this as the rated cut, so I do want to check out the director's cut when it's available. I do think this film has the potential to move up to a great film, but after the initial viewing I have it as good.",The House That Jack Built

35,fntstcplnt,The House That Jack Built (2018),6,12 July 2019,"Directed by Lars von Trier. Starring Matt Dillon, Bruno Ganz, Riley Keough, Uma Thurman, Siobhan Fallon Hogan, Jeremy Davies, Sofie Gråbøl. (R)Disturbing serial killer drama from controversial director Lars von Trier; familiarity with his output should prepare you for what's in store. Dillon plays the titular psychopath as a volatile, obsessive-compulsive creep, lacking empathy but not detachment, and it's certainly a bravura piece of unsettling acting. Unfortunately that performance is at the center of an overlong (2.5+ hours), deeply unpleasant film-going experience, one that mistakes provocation with statement too often not to be dramatically uneven. Despite the gruesome murder and mutilation on display (including a brief scene that will make animal lovers wail in horror), the most difficult thing to endure here are the bits of pretentious navel-gazing during off-screen ""narration-style"" philosophical discussions of life and art between Dillon and Ganz, who plays the Roman poet Virgil (he's called ""Verge"" through most of the film, but a remark about ""Aeneid"" around the midway point is a glaring enough clue that we're headed for some Dante's ""Divine Comedy"" applesauce in the epilogue). Excluding that epilogue, the film is broken up into five chapters (or ""incidents) detailing past killings, mostly involving (""stupid,"" as he calls them) women, all but one unnamed; it's perhaps telling that von Trier provides them such limited human qualities so that they represent innocent flesh more than substantive characters. Difficult to recommend, even if you don't mind the sensation of your skin crawling and stomach turning, but even more difficult to dismiss entirely.56/100",The House That Jack Built

37,saptesh786,Not a movie ! Documentary of a psycho Killer !,1,1 January 2019,"Some movies are not for your entertainment but are only for director's satisfaction. 'The house that Jack built' is like the same. Not a single moment in the movie entertains you. Only full of slaughtering, murders and bloody scenes from start to end. You even see such horrifying brutal acts in details whereas you don't want to see it at all. 60 or more murders did by hero ( villain ?) but none of his victim resist him? At least not a punch seen anywhere. He fools peoples and police like they are child and has no brain. Only killer has! The length of such movie is 2.30 hours means you have to watch sinful brutal drama without escaping till end like a punishment. And what is about end? An angel come from heaven to take our hero at the hell . What a idea ! When slaughtering 60 peoples there is no angel ! May be he was sleeping and called him by director saying him that now come my movie is to be end and you have a role here so that viewers can get release from my torture drama jail.
Uma Thurman is wasting here. Totally reverse roll from Kill bill.If you want to learn how to be a killer (sorry, serial killer) then you must watch this. This is ideal course material. Some universities may add for degree course.You are expecting entertainer then totally avoid this title. You will be upset.And I bet you can't see all five incidents in this movie.Rest aside all positive reviews and suggested awards. It is not watchable movie. In other words it is not a movie. Only a psycho killer's documentary.",The House That Jack Built

39,Vivekmaru45,Another very disturbing movie by Lars Von Trier paralleling his earlier work Antichrist(2009).,6,20 December 2018,"This is not how I would like to remember Matt Dillon. I would however like to remember him for the role he played in the film The Saint of Fort Washington(1993).I have only watched one movie of Lars von Trier called Antichrist(2009). And I didn't even like that movie. This film can be classified as a serial killer movie. The main character of the film called simply ""Jack"", is a person that suffers from a compulsive personality disorder that prompts him to kill people and then arrange them into artwork. He then photographs his so-called art.My favorite movies are based on real-life serial killers. Ted Bundy(The Deliberate StrangerTV Movie 1986), John Wayne Gacy(To Catch a Killer TV Movie 1992), Jeffery Dahmer(The Secret Life 1993), Henry Lee Lucas(Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer 1986), Ed Gain(Deranged 1974), Andrei Chikatilo(Citizen X 1995, Evilenko 2004), Albert Fish(The Gray Man 2007), Carl Panzram(Killer: A Journal of Murder 1995), John Reginald Christie(10 Rillington Place 1971). Note these movies are very disturbing, watch them with a strong heart - when you watch these film pray for the souls of the hapless victims taken before their time.Verdict: Matt Dillon's acting is 10/10 as always. Uma Thurman gives a small cameo. I think she's still very beautiful and she's one of my favorite actresses. Bruno Ganz(Nosferatu The Vampyre 1979) another favorite of mine give a very moving performance as Verge. Verge alludes to Virgil, a poet and Dante's guide through Hell and Purgatory. There are a lot of philosophical allusions throughout the movie that life is evil and soulless. The direction by Lars von Trier enforces this.",The House That Jack Built

42,kuarinofu,Quality work,8,13 December 2018,"Just came back from this movie's midnight screening and I can say I'm satisfled. This was a well crafted experience. A well written story of a psycopath's serial killings presented by him (which adds some tints and flavors) as an artist's work. This is the short version.
It's much more deeper but I don't really want to spoil anything for you. Interestingly enough, everything in this movie also acts as a tool, the music (cycling through mental states of the main character), the dialogue (sometimes awkward on purpose to see his evolution), some beautiful shots intercut with archive footage to illustrate Jack's inner vision and more.
The ending got me a little confused since I don't think I caught exactly what the movie was trying to say (got the easier references but not all of them) but other than that - it was a rich and deep experience for me.

They did not make me believe in any way this man was capable of much less tying his shoes. The 2 lady so reluctant to let him in was OK as soon as he said he could double her pension. Please.

And no doubt that is what attracted Matt Dillon to the project.. But the fact of the matter is this director definitely has his best work behind him. Much like Spike Lee and Oliver Stone. And there is probably a very good reason why he hasn't done a film for the past decade. He just didn't have anything to say. And I don't feel like he had anything to say with this movie either. Dillon did a great job. But he just didn't have much to work with. The writing was halfway decent. Bruno Ganz was great. But It just did not add up to very much in the end. And the ending was just silly. I would say save your time and watch something decent. This film is lacking anything in the way of substance.,The House That Jack Built
48,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Works Best When Not Trying So Hard,6,27 December 2018,"THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT isn't quite sure when it's good since the good parts don't last long enough, or connect to the movie as a whole, pieced together with boring and annoying off-screen conversational narration (i.e. colorless commentary) between Matt Dillon and a mysterious, unestablished Bruno Ganz...As a Serial Killer Movie, the most interesting scenes are the deaths, and there are five ""situations"" in total, warned up front by title cards. But overboard director Lars von Trier throws in so many video clips (Nazis, etc) that in trying to connect with the ""ultra violence"" on screen, the story and character become secondhand as opposed to second-nature for Matt Dillon's Jack, made up like someone who'd be teased about dressing like ""a serial killer"" including awkward glasses and uncomfortably looking ""nice clothes."" In fact, his first victim in Matt's BEAUTIFUL GIRLS co-star Uma Thurman literally begs to be murdered.The next two deaths successfully wield an intentionally irritating vibe that Jack could strike at his intended victim at... any... moment...And the very fact that (especially during the first hour) you don't want him caught during particular close calls... especially as he's moving the bodies to a privately-owned meat-packing room... is proof the movie's working i.e. you want the exploitative bloodshed to continue since... well... that's what it's about: You didn't pay for a romantic comedy...But the violence, while seeming real enough within the movie, often feels distant and unrealized from the perspective of Dillon's character: as if we're seeing what he's fantasizing as opposed to the reality of a sick, twisted mind.Von Tier plays his CLOCKWORK ORANGE inspired hand so close to this fictionalized psychopath that, in trying to show all this bloodshed as mundane and par-for-the-course, there's very little to be actually shocked about...Especially as the well runs try before the overlong arthouse production is less than halfway through.

It churned my stomach because there isn't a pleasant moment in this entire film and the camera is constantly shaky and there is a scene in which the camera spins around giving you motion sickness not to mention the long drawn out watch checking sequences of the killer talking to a Freudlike angel of death. Apparently they could only commission one early eighties song which plays over and over and over during the two and a half hours of this poorly acted mess and which might have made sense in Natural Born Killers but doesn't make that much sense here unless you just want to make mass murder seem groovy.Actually, I started writing this review before I watched the last half hour of this film and now that I've finished it I just don't even know what to say. This film isn't a ""dark comedy"" as people claim, but the ending sequence is so idiotic and comedic it's just ridiculous. All in all this film is a waste of time. It has no point to it.

52,SkullScreamerReturns,Like American Psycho but more artsy and symbolic,7,6 August 2021,"I haven't seen many Lars von Trier films. I only remember I hated ""Dancer in the Dark"" when I watched it as a teenager. That's another story, I'll watch it again sometime and write a review.""The House that Jack Built"" got my attention from some ""disturbing movies"" list on the net. The premise about a serial killer sounded interesting so I put it in my watchlist.But this is a difficult movie to review...In the surface it's a lot like American Psycho - a sick story told through the eyes of a killer. In aforementioned film Christian Bale's over the top performance made it seem also comedic. This one, too, has comedic elements but it's more subtle. Matt Dillon's lead character is somehow more creepy. He's funny too but he's unpredictable and weird. His motivations are quite unclear which makes it more disturbing.My mind is blank when I try to describe this movie. It escapes the categories you want to put it in..but I guess that's von Trier for you.Most of the time I thought ""ok, this is similar to American Psycho, this is a macabre murder drama-comedy"" - which it is, but it is also more. It has a lot philosophical speculation about the essence of art and morality, and the murder story gets some kind of symbolic frame around it, even though it's perhaps a bit thin. And then there is an interesting ending. The less you know about it the better, but I was really surprised. I got some David Lynch feel and (the director admits this in the bonus interview) - Ingmar Bergman influence. He also says this is his most Hitchcock style film, which I didn't come to think of.Strange but fascinating film.

53,eagandersongil,"Cruel, grand and proud.",9,5 November 2018,"Lars Von Trier gives himself completely to his egocentricity and superb in his new film, with touches of genius and subtleties of failure at the same time, the new film of the always controversial Danish director requires mental and stomach effort to digest and watch his two and a half hours about the philosophy of art, or the philosophy of a murderer, or the philosophy of violence, are some points among the various ramblings that permeate the film.
First of all, his script follows the division that Lars Von Trier usually uses, with epilogue and prologue, but it resembles in particular with his last long, ""Nymphomania"" by the constant conversation with a listener, but not only for this, there is a parallel very clear in his ambitions, in ""Ninfomaniaca"", Lars Von Trier tries to explain the world and human nature through sex, here, we have the same objectives, but with broader focuses such as art, violence, sadism and religion. Lars Von Trier makes a great film through the multiple views of interpretations, we can interpret the film as a psychopath's trip to the psyche or we can pay attention to his philosophical explanations and excuses for death, life, art and the world, or we can only see one film about a murderer, ""The House Jack Built"" needs a lot of the maturity of the viewer, as it is a film that requires a lot of attention to be able to understand its signs, even if some, Lars Von Trier throws in your face. We have discussions ranging from the vilanization of man in modern culture to art in the practice of genocide, passing through love and materialization in art and search for feeling, are many ideas, and the great demerit of the film is I could not complete and complete all only in this film, since in his cinematography, Lars complements these subjects. Lars uses a very own script feature, the 7-part division that tells random stories draw the sensation of plot progress from the viewer, which for the smarter, will only be able to see the progress and division of the acts through the conversation of our protagonist with the character of the verge, in addition to several metaphors involving his feelings, like the house itself or the refrigerator door that does not open, the film causes a certain distance from the protagonist with the public, because our protagonist is completely depraved and sick, but we must not judge him or his acts to embark on his sick journey with refinements of cruelty and genius provided by Lars Von Trier and Matt Dillon.",The House That Jack Built
54,x_manicure_x,Uncompromising,7,14 August 2021,"""The House that Jack Built"" has been marketed as a horror movie or a thriller, but I found it much more enjoyable as a pitch-black comedy and a realistic character study. I am sure it would have sold more tickets if it was a conventional serial killer flick, but I loved the idea of turning it into the life reflections and philosophical essay by an OCD psychopath. Maybe it could have been at least thirty minutes shorter, but it was pretty enjoyable overall (even if never memorable). I couldn't help thinking of Jack's confessions and self-indulgent monologues as Lars von Trier's own reflections over his career and fame as a controversial and provocative artist. Jack's philosophical divagations played over archival footage somehow reminded me of the old school ""Metal Gear Solid"" monologues.By the way, the critics at Cannes who found this extreme must have spent their whole career watching dramas on Netflix. Sure it's a cruel and gruesome film, but we have seen much worse.",The House That Jack Built
55,Rendanlovell,A great movie clouded by an ego,6,21 December 2018,The film has long stretches of our main character discussing art and death that utterly ruin a compelling character study. Matt dillion is great in the lead role and the main character can be quite interesting. Von triers direction also does a solid job of making you feel the impact of a scene but boy does this movie love itself. It's nearly the definition of pretentious. (I mean he literally credits himself in as many roles as possible including ones he just made up) What Lars has created is a film that he just had to ruin. Shoving in clips from his own movies as our main character explains what makes good art or praising Hitler's killings and building design. Who knows if this is actually Von Triers views or not but it seems very likely that it is and its entirely his fault that this movie fails.,The House That Jack Built
56,Rendanlovell,An ego reigns supreme,6,23 December 2018,"Recently I watched my first ever Lars Von Trier movie. The now infamous director has some incredibly controversial films under his belt. Films like AntiChrist, Melancholia, and Nymphomaniac. And The House that Jack built follows in these other films controversial footsteps. It's A film that is no holds barred in a number of ways. It's incredibly violent and disturbing, depicting extreme violence against children, animals, women, etc. Which, on its own, would be unacceptable by today's standards but the film is all about A serial killer that fancies himself an abstract artist. Which oddly enough, describes Von Trier himself, but we'll get into that in a moment. The film tells the story of Jack, a serial killer that recounts 5 of his life-defining killings over a 12 year period. the film is full of inner monologues, parrels between art and life, and characters discussing the details of art. So obviously this movie is going to be quiet divisive. Some people will love this movies no holds barred attitude. But others will undoubtedly despise it for the same reasons. As for me, I'm unfortunately on the fence, which is apparently a place Lars doesn't want anyone to be. Again, something I'll address soon. The biggest reason I'm on the fence with this film isn't because of its violent nature or even the highly disturbing aspects it has. In fact I love these aspects of the film. I love how violent and unrestricted it is. I love the main characters attempts and failures at being an artist. The biggest reason this fails for me is Lars Von Trier himself. Again, I haven't seen anything else he's done but I definitely recognize his work. I think this film is a special breed of Pretentious though. Which isn't a word I use to describe many films because I don't think many films are as undeniably full of themselves as this one is. There are an innumerable amount examples I can point to that prove this point. Whether it's Lars putting clips FROM HIS OWN MOVIES in this film as the main character talks about what makes good, long-lasting art. Or him crediting himself in a number of different roles like the House of Corpses concept creator. Just from watching this film I found it to be incredibly clear that this man is an egotistical maniac that just can't help but constantly pat himself on the back. But this kind of ego is something I'm not sure I've ever seen before so after watching the film I felt compelled to do a ludicrous amount of research on this man. And what I found turned this vividly clear portrait of an ego crazy maniac a bit muddy. The more I dug into the man, the more I realized that this man is a weirdo. He's a social outcast that struggles with anxiety, depression, and social situations in general. He gets flustered under the spotlight incredibly easy and often says a bunch of stupid things that he doesn't mean. Like that time he said he was a Nazi and that he understands Hitler. So how can this man be so amazingly pretentious while simultaneously being a clear social outcast? Well I think the answer is hidden in The House that Jack Built. He's said that the film has a lot of him in it which is something that can be said for all his films. From what I understand, his other films balance themes of Nihilism, depression, and dark humor just as this film does. But unlike Antichrist or any number of his other works, The House that Jack Built isn't about a theme or a message. It's about him. Where his other works merely reflected who he was, I think this film is just about him entirely. I think Jack is a character modeled after himself. Jack is a serial killer that wants to be an artist who suffers from obvious mental illnesses like OCD. There's a scene in the film when Jack murders a lady in her own home. But before he can leave he is forced by his own brain to clean and re-clean a number of times before he is satisfied. But slowly, over time this OCD side of him wears away and he begins to take more risks with his ""art"". He is also constantly talking to what we think is a voice in his head about art, engineering, and why he feels compelled to kill. I think this reflects Von Trier and his own artistic endeavors. He's always been an incredibly provocative filmmaker but, at first, he was making films with a message. Which was his personal form of art. But each movie up until now seems to find him pushing the boundaries further and further, trying to see what he can get away with. Now, he has completely dropped the facade of movie making. Now he is simply making movies because it makes HIM feel good. He no longer has an interest in entertaining or making people feel what he feels. All he wants now is to make himself feel good. The parallel between Jack and Von Trier in this way is very obvious. At first, Jack is killing people because he believes his vision will change the world but over time he begins to realize that he is a failure and continues to kill people simply because it's all he knows. After 12 years of killing people, Jack has nothing left in his life but killing. There's a scene in the film where Jack describes killing and how he feels great as he does it but the euphoria of killing quickly turns into pain. And when the pain is at it's most intense he must kill again. I think this is how von Trier feels towards his films at this point. He's said that making movies is both easy and his form of therapy. So if he is a victim of his own mind as it seems he is, this metaphor of having to create or being in constant pain feels like it applies to his work. And the back forth that Jack has with Verge seems to be Von Triers own thoughts going back and forth. Should he say this? Should he do that? Of course, this is all speculation on my part but it makes sense to me. It makes sense that Von Trier views himself as a serial killer of sorts. He is undoubtedly a controversial figure and perhaps he feels that he won't fully be understood until he goes to hell. I think if you view the film through this lens it's an incredibly compelling character study. The problem is that the film shouldn't be about him. Great art is when the artist can communicate something that resonates with people or demands change in some way. But The House That Jack Built doesn't do this. Instead, it seems to only exist because Lars needed people to look at him again. He wanted the spotlight back on him so desperately that he made a piece of art about him making a piece of art. Which doesn't resonate with me nor does it demand change. He doesn't leave room in the film for the audience to see anything in but himself. And that doesn't step you forward as an artist. If anything that catapults you backward. For a film that so extensively discusses art Lars displays a fundamental misunderstanding of what art truly is and why it's so valuable.",The House That Jack Built
57,kaptenvideo-89875,"Be afraid! The bad boy of European movie industry, Von Trier is back in movie theatres after 5 year hiatus.",7,27 October 2018,"The story follows Jack (Matt Dillon), a highly intelligent serial killer, over the course of 12 years, and depicts the murders that develop his inner madman.Also starring - Bruno Ganz, Uma Thurman, Siobhan Fallon Hogan, Sofie Gråbøl, Riley Keough, Jeremy Davies.This doesn't happen often: I watched the whole movie, the two and a half hours of it, and still couldn't say whether I find it good or bad, or even whether I liked it or not. Didn't find it boring, that's for sure - although I wouldn't call it exciting either, exactly.One reason are the short but vivid scenes of extreme violence, which make one take a mental step back from the experience, and even think about not writing a review at all. Just in case that some reader would think that I condone violence or something.The second reason is, of course, Lars von Trier himself, the co-writer and director of this joint. He doesn't seem extreme in interviews, but when it comes to work, the notorious film-maker likes to provoke and divide audiences without hesitation.And ""The House That Jack Built"" might just be one of his crowning achievements in that.Critics are divided as well. Many see the movie as empty provocation, or just tedious. Some see it as a something more. One is certain: it's not a mainstream entertainment. Not only for the overall creepiness and length, but also for how it's been put together.You see, Von Trier has been more interested in making a point than making a movie with audience-friendly flow or tempo.Compared to the ""regular"" movies, there's no clear structure - yes, Jack's story is divided between five cases but what happens during each is never easily anticipated - or for how long.This is one of those rare movies which keep you guessing for the most time, never knowing what can happen next.Von Trier also doesn't try to build and hold suspense, like in a ""normal"" movie, especially the one about serial killers.He may have even actively worked against letting us just watch and get carried away because there's so much narration during the whole thing - in fhe form of constant dialogue between Jack and his mysterious companion played by Bruno Ganz.Maybe because of the spotaneousness and unpredicability of the central antihero, it somehow still works. I never found myself idling and bored. Even during the end-section that left me even quite puzzled, which was clearly the authors' intent.What makes it all so provocative and divisive, then, you may ask. It's the constant narration or dialogue between the serial killer and his companion. They argue over different things, mainly whether killing can be considered as art, and what makes murder such a bad thing anyway.At first glance, these may seem like a stupid questions, but there's more to these arguments than wish to break taboos or something. Von Trier has deeper thoughts on the matter, and he wishes to make the audience think along.People will interpret Von Trier's intentions differently, which is surely part of his goal. I would summarize the central thesis that if art is an act of creation and self-expression, then artful killing can be art too (which it certainly is for the serial killer Jack).And before you rush to claim that killing is bad, let's not forget that everybody is at least indirectly or partly responsible for certain amount of death around the world, from eating meat, or even buying it and then just throwing it away, to not taking an active stand against destroying the environment where we all live.Von Trier goes on to discuss several connecting themes, such as how killing can be addiction and how most of the violence is somehow associated with only men.But the most shocking parts are Jack's actual killings, especially some that I didn't believe the author would dare to include in this day and age of political correctness.Then again, the director's own stance seems to be against killing, because it's never glorified which is rare in the movies indeed.Some of these acts may be funny in their own horrible way but none is intended to make you feel this adrenalin-induced watching glee as in most action flicks. If a person gets shot, for example, there's nothing cool and visually captivating about it. One just drops down like a big bag of flour, and stays this way.Having commented on all the ""important"" things about the production, I can't forget Matt Dillon giving a remarkable performance as our anti-hero.Just like the movie's approach to killings, there is nothing show-offish about him work. He seems to have wholly immersed into this character which makes him just mesmerizing in its own quiet way.Dillon's easy naturalness combined with the unpredictability of the character makes this a cinematic ""bad guy"" to remember, although there's little unforgettably cinematic about him per se.""The House That Jack Built"" is a movie quite unlike anything else that you can see in cinemas this year. Unless you and I visit very different kind of cinemas.Anyway, don't approach without hard stomach. Von Trier is not for everybody, and has never been, especially his latest.",The House That Jack Built
58,noahgibbobaker,Pretentious nonsense?!?!?,7,8 March 2021,"This is essentially Lars Von Trier stroking his cock and tickling his balls for two and a half hours, for a phase it feels good but you can't jerk off for long without it feeling boring and repetitive.""The House That Jack Built"" takes a sartorius angle on art films and specifically Lars Von Trier films. It does this by showing what it thinks are uncompromising disgusting acts, over explaining everything and showing pointless montages of high art and architecture and whatever else Jack and the disembodied or corporeal voice of Verge are talking about. I think the satire would have worked a treat for me if Lars hadn't removed two ribs in order in suck his own dick while presenting this element. There's a montage of what Lars considers high art with clips from both ""Melancholia"" and ""Antichrist"" which is enough to get a good idea about how pretentious everything about this is. Despite having criticisms about the kind of parody angle I actually really liked it for the most part, yes it's extremely self-indulgent and ends up repeating the same point over and over but it's also genuinely hilarious and actually pretty smart a lot of the time.I liked a few of the performances, especially Matt Dillon', the cinematography is cinematography in a Von Trier film, same goes for the editing, the dialogue is unbearable at times and not great during the moments where I don't recoil at it either, the soundtrack was good and surprisingly not annoying cause, like the film, it's very repetitive and the score was awesome, the many montages + narration take away any room for interpretation which really hurt the film, but is also kind of the point of the film which is a problem I encountered criticising many elements of this movie. I likely would have immensely enjoyed this film if everything before the last 20 minutes weren't explained to me.Jack is meant to be a genius, he's referred to as a genius many times over the course of his film but he does so many dumb things unrelated to his OCD (which as someone with OCD I can confirm is delt with well) only because satire? Or is it bad writing that can be written off as satire, this is why I had trouble critiquing this, almost everything ""bad"" about it can be played off as satire, but many of these things that can simply be shrugged off severely damage my enjoyment. Except for one thing, the uncompromising violence is nowhere near as brutal as it thinks it is, none of the imagery or implied violence had any effect on me which at times ruined the sartorius angle, the family sequence is the worst culprit of this, it comes off very silly, I laughed during this elongated stint of the movie because it was all so predictable, terribly executed, terribly acted, Lars still can't direct children, unnecessary and (again) disgustingly pretentious, so I didn't laugh for the reasons intended.Despite having criticisms and despite really hating my viewing experience for about an hour I still really enjoyed seeing that state of the worth from Von Trier's perspective. You might know that I'm borderline obsessed with what people think so to see so many of his thoughts laid out in front of me was something quite special. He does like to shove his ideas down audiences throats but it's alright with me.",The House That Jack Built

However, the storytelling is good and the film often frames the titular Jack a bit comedically, which occasionally lightens the mood of the very grim subject matter. It also goes out of it's way to condemn and vilify his actions so that von Trier doesn't need to be put on a public watch list.

61,TheVictoriousV,When you're so unique it becomes boring.,4,29 December 2018,"Does anyone else miss pre-depression Lars von Trier? I still give him Antichrist and even Melancholia, but the ""just because"" stylistic choices of the tedious Nymphomaniac made me yearn for a time when he had enough thought behind his unconventionality to give us his wonderful Dancer in the Dark, and enough humor to give us Riget. He was always nasty, defiant, and upsetting like only he knows how, but some things have changed.Now we have The House That Jack Built; another film that, despite how different it is from every other movie out now, still manages to be predictable if you know your Trier. I often defend strange decisions and rule-breaking in film, as with Michael Haneke's Funny Games, but Von Trier somehow manages to make clear that the only reason he's breaking the rules is that he's Von Trier, the supposed arthouse emperor. See what I did with that shot? Aren't these title cards weird? Look at how oddly edited everything is!We get ""more of the usual"" in other departments as well. The documentary-esque camera work (à la Dogme 95), the super-slow-motion bits, the jump-cuts, the lengthy lecture-like conversations, and the controversial scenes of violence and mutilation. The villain protagonist, OCD-ridden serial killer Jack, narrates the film nigh constantly, and despite sometimes doing us the favor of explaining to us what he's thinking and feeling, I don't know that he ranks among the greatest, most complex killers of cinema.Matt Dillon is good in the role but like many a recent Trier character, Jack rarely partakes in any particularly human interactions or monologues. It's difficult to emotionally connect with the characters of Von Trier lately, especially when they start reciting whatever opinion or observation was on the director's mind while he was writing and felt the need to vent.The movie supposedly alludes to his fiasco at Cannes. You know, that time when he apparently ""understood Hitler""? I didn't notice this when I saw the film myself but I believe in the critics (there's definitely a sequence where he congratulates himself). It's nice that he got to screen another film at the festival after all, but the film in question may have made his future at Cannes uncertain.In the movie, Jack retells a number of ""incidents"" from the past 12 years of his life, where he would slaughter women played by the likes of Uma Thurman, Riley Keough, and Siobhan Fallon Hogan - these scenes, I gather, haven't exactly countered the idea that Von Trier has weird feelings about women. I maintain that he gave us admirable female characters in pictures like Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark, but who knows? Did the divorce change things?Listening avidly to Jack's tale is Bruno Ganz, never seen by the viewer but often heard making obvious observations, and/or notes which Von Trier no doubt really WANTS the audience to make during a given scene. Again, thanks for the assistance.The House That Jack Built is just not that rewarding to watch. It's amazing how a movie can be so different, so completely defiant, and yet so completely unsurprising at the same time. When you're spoonfed all emotions and themes, and you've gotten used to the cruel violence and even the persistent rule-breaking within the presentation, what's there to chew on? Towards the end, the film goes for a more surreal (albeit at times just ""random"") approach and I find myself interested again, although it isn't quite enough.Hell, the film doesn't even have Udo Kier. What kind of Von Trier film is that?",The House That Jack Built

Like von Trier is commonly known to do, he'll beat you over the head a couple of times with the same sequences (AKA that damn piano man), songs, themes, and monologues. Sometimes, this can surface as an overdone and less adequate practice of assimilating a moral out. The dude is a bit, too big-headed at times, being he is von Truer and what not, and I firmly wished he owned up to this movie simply being a full-on, insightful, dark comedy, but him being him, he always has to insert his pretentious you-know-what.Glorification of blood and guts though? Yeah, I can take it.I personally feel like, these days, the popularity and acceptance of dark humor is continuously decreasing. What is considered ""dark humor"" now, is merely, more so, just being unexpectedly edgy, instead of legitimentally pushing the boundaries of discomfort through gruesomely comedic pleasement. This could obviously be due to how sensitive the media and this generation's privelage has built us up as. What is considered humor is now considered offensive, etc., etc., etc.I think y'all just needa take a deep breath and realize that this is just a movie, not reality. Yah sure, films can influence the real world's perceptions and behaviors, but nobody is going to come out of the satirical, dark comedy known as, The House That Jack Built, saying, ""Man, I think I'm gonna become a serial killer now, because this movie has persuaded my perception of the world so much that now, it has, from the heavens above, told me that that's what I've always wanted and was destined to be. I am enlightened."" If anything it's going to counteract the opposite effect, meaning, the audience is generally going to be disturbed by the main character's acts rather than enlightened.What happened to the good'old Kurt Vonnegut days when we could reflect on the trauma of the repetition of death, but in unison, laugh at the finatics behind it in order to blockade our awareness of society's capacity to violence.Also, I don't think people really understand/ know how psychopaths/serial killers function. Most of the time, they're born like that, not necessarily influenced. People who murder based on influence for the purpose of achieving an advantageable goal (blameful criminals) and people who murder out of genetic disorder/desire are two completely different factors (psychopaths).So, in the end, it's absolutely okay if you don't like the movie especially if you don't like it for being too pretentious which I absolutely can get behind. Those who hate it simply for the accessive violent I can get behind too-just don't be a little you-know-what about it and say it should be banned in every country and that anybody who likes it should be sent to solitary confinement. We need to learn to suck it up and move on with life. There are real world issues you should be complaining about right now, not a damn movie.Conclusively, what I'm saying is that you can't deny the craft. You can hate the movie-absolutely-but you can't deny how in terms of dialogue, writing, and just the overall comedic presence, The House That Jack Built is unlike anything ever created, in a morbidly entertaining fashion.Okay, I'm done with my rant. Sorry for my Tom-foolery!I don't know how Lars von Trier does it, but he's able to disturb you once a murderer occurs and then instantaneously, make you chuckle after it happens. He's making us sick individuals and I don't know if I like it. All I know is I really, really like The House That Jack Built. I guess we'll just have to leave it at that for now.

65,Bertaut,Self-indulgent? Absolutely. Disturbing? Partly. Hilarious? Definitely.,7,30 December 2018,"Ostensibly a psychological horror/serial killer film, in reality, the latest from professional provocateur Lars von Trier is more a dark comedy about the nature of art, capped off with a quite literal descent into Hell. As much an interrogation of his own dark psychology as an ""up yours"" to his detractors and the oft-levelled accusations of misogyny, von Trier all but dares you to be offended, whether by the violence done to a duckling, the cold-blooded murder of children, the verbal degradation of a woman, the critique of the #MeToo movement, the celebration of Albert Speer, or the mockery of American gun culture. Partly self-reflexive, the film is more of an apologia than an apology for von Trier's oeuvre. When he's really on his game (Breaking the Waves (1996), Dancer in the Dark (2000), Dogville (2003), Melancholia (2011)), von Trier is capable of depicting horrific violence alongside psychologically complex characters and scenes of devastating emotional veracity. House, which is far too long and tends towards self-indulgence, doesn't come anywhere near those heights, and is thus more open to accusations of empty provocation, but von Trier has definitely tapped into ""something"" here, and, love it or hate it, you will react to it.As the film begins, we hear (but don't see) a conversation between Jack (an emotionless Matt Dillon) and ""Verge"" (the always superb Bruno Ganz) as Jack attempts to defend and justify his serial killing. Choosing to discuss five random but illustrative ""incidents"" over a period of twelve years during the 70s and 80s, the subsequent film is divided into six sections (""1st Incident"", ""2nd Incident"" etc., and ""Epilogue: Katabasis""). A wannabe architect whose mother forced him to be an engineer, Jack, who suffers from OCD, contends that his murders are literal works of art, and has given himself the moniker ""Mr Sophistication"". And that's about it as far as plot is concerned, although it certainly wouldn't hurt to be at least partially familiar with the work of William Blake and the Inferno book of Dante Alighieri's Divina Commedia.The film was originally developed as a TV miniseries by von Trier and Jenle Hallund, who has a ""Story By"" credit on the final film. Premièring out of competition at Cannes 2018, it was the first film in Cannes history to feature a warning on the tickets (for ""scènes violentes""), and at the much-publicised première, over one-hundred people walked out, although those that stayed gave it a ten-minute standing ovation. Particularly galling to some viewers has been the scene where a young Jack (Emil Tholstrup) cuts off a duckling's leg, places it back into the pond from which he took it, and watches it drown. PETA, however, defended the film, praising the fact that it draws attention to the link between adolescent animal abuse and adult psychopathy, and for the realistic special effects.To begin parsing the film, one first needs to look at the character of Jack himself, specifically his lack of emotional interiority. Call it sociopathy, call it an inability to empathise, whilst there's definitely an intellectual core (seen in the many digressions he and Verge take concerning art and the nature of the artist), Jack is emotionally dead. Although we see him practising various emotional states in the mirror, he does this so as not to stand out when in the company of others, and the only real emotions we ever see from him are irritation and anger, and even they are rare. Irritation is confined mainly to the 1st Incident, where he gives a lift to a woman whose car has broken down (Uma Thurman), and gradually gets more and more vexed as she goads him - telling him he looks like a serial killer but is obviously way too much of a ""wimp"" to ever actually kill anyone. Anger is mainly seen in the 5th Incident, when, right as he is about to murder a group of men tied up in the industrial freezer he uses to store bodies, he realises he has been sold hollow point bullets instead of full metal jackets, prompting an infuriated trip to the gun store and a hilarious berating of the owner, Al (Jeremy Davies).It is, of course, impossible to ignore the parallels between Jack and von Trier himself. Although Jack is not a 1:1 surrogate, it's hard to deny the analogy of how Jack feels the need to one-up himself with each murder, becoming more and more sadistic as he goes. This, of course, has become a very common criticism of von Trier's filmography. He has also been accused of misogyny and of exploiting the psychological (and often physical) suffering of his actors, just as Jack is a misogynist who exploits the suffering of his victims. And this isn't subtext. Rather, von Trier himself makes the connection explicit when a discussion of genocide and tyranny features a montage of scenes from his own filmography.As with Nymph()maniac, the film is structured around a conversation between two people, with frequent digressions to topics often fairly tangential to the main narrative. So whilst Nymph()maniac gave us treaties on fly-fishing, parallel parking, and the Fibonacci sequence, House features discussions concerning viticulture, the oak tree in Buchenwald, cathedral architecture, and the dichotomy of predator and prey (via a rather simplistic comparative analysis of Blake's ""The Lamb"" (1776) and ""The Tyger"" (1794)). One especially interesting digression is a monologue where Jack laments the fact that men are the defacto villains of every situation. Being set in the 70s and 80s, there's no specific mention of #MeToo, but it's obvious where the invective is aimed. Coming across like a slightly more unhinged Jordan B. Peterson, Jack has no time for debates concerning gender fluidity or sexual misconduct, even going so far as to suggest that women are more cooperative murder victims because they're ""easier to work with."" You can all-but hear Rose McGowan blowing a gasket!Aside from the aforementioned duckling scene, by far the most disturbing scene is the 4th Incident. Here, we are introduced to Jacqueline (an excellent Riley Keough), whom Jack has been dating for a while. What is most distressing about the scene is not how Jack kills her (although it's far and away the most graphic death in the film), but what precedes her murder, as Jack mercilessly verbally belittles her, calling her by the nickname he has given her, ""Simple"", because he believes she is so unintelligent. He then takes great delight in revealing to her that he is Mr Sophistication, suggesting that she scream; the futility of which he demonstrates by shouting out an open window, ""no one will help you."" It's a devastating scene, far more emotionally upsetting than it is physically violent, and because of that, it's one of the best scenes in the film, provoking a genuine emotional response in the viewer beyond mere disgust.As unsettling as this scene is, the film can also be extremely funny, with the entire 2nd Incident playing out like an extended Key and Peele (2012) sketch. Trying to gain entry to a woman's (Siobhan Fallon Hogan) house, Jack does a hilariously bad impression of a policeman, explaining, ""I don't have my badge with me because I'm getting a promotion"", and then cheerfully waving to a passing driver as if they are best friends. Once inside, he only manages to kill his victim at the third attempt, and then, having left the house, his OCD compels him to return three times to check for blood splatters in such places as behind a picture on the wall and under the leg of a chair. Finally, to get away from the cops that have shown up, he ties the body to the back of his van, pulling it along the road, and leaving a blood trail from the house to his industrial freezer, only for it to start raining and erase the blood.I'd be remiss here if I didn't mention the extraordinarily beautiful epilogue, wherein Jack and Verge descend to hell (""Katabasis"" is the Ancient Greek word for ""descent""). This incredible sequence starts with a stunning repurposing of Eugène Delacroix's La Barque de Dante (1822), and culminates in a Hell that's equal parts Hieronymus Bosch, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, and Zdzislaw Beksinski.However, the film is far from perfect. For starters, it can be incredibly self-indulgent. It's also unnecessarily long, and there are stretches which are extremely tedious. I'm also not sure that a clip reel of von Trier's own films was the wisest choice. Additionally, the female characters, by the very nature of the narrative structure, are empty shells who exist only to be murdered. We may feel a degree of sympathy for them (especially Sofie Gråbøl in the 3rd Incident), but only Jacqueline has any degree of psychological verisimilitude. Some of the digressions concerning art and its relationship to love and hate are also (perhaps intentionally) juvenile and intellectually vapid.Whilst it could be argued that House is about a desensitised world indifferent to suffering, it seems to be more about Lars von Trier and the criticisms that have been levelled against him over the years. Although he doesn't seem willing to apologise for anything, he is more than happy to defend, attempting to use the depiction of violence so as to facilitate introspection, reflecting on the importance (or lack thereof) of morality and culpability in artistic creation. House is an especially self-reflexive and somewhat self-disdainful film, which Von Trier has intimated may be his last, and if that is so, it certainly makes for a fittingly provocative and confrontational final word.",The House That Jack Built
66,homecoming8,Arthouse meets Horror..,7,9 March 2019,"I 'm not a fan of Lars von Trier or arthouse movies in general. But horror movies I love. Especially serial killer/slashers/disturbing movies. Von Trier's ""Antichrist"" (2009) was well acted (Willem Dafoe) with some controversial scenes but boring as hell.During the avant screening of the unrated cut of ""The House That Jack Built"" it's reported that 100 people walked out because of disturbing scenes. Leading star is (the underrated) Matt Dillon (There's Something About Mary, Wild Things, Crash). Those are 2 reasons why I was looking forward to this, not because of the director.But Von Trier may be a controversial director but he's good and he knows how to shock you. Again, the film could have benefited if it wasn't stretched out to 2 1/2 hours. The pace is sometimes slow and a number of scenes and dialogue could have easily been cut. Matt Dillon shines in his role as serial killer, some scenes are indeed controversial and shocking but at the same time scary and full of tension. The 'family' scene is maybe the best part but also quite disturbing and shocking as hell.Sadly, co-star Bruno Ganz (Der Untergang) recently passed away.This will remind you a bit of the low budget ""Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer"" starring Michael Rooker. ""The House That Jack Built"" leans more to that film than other famous, well-made serial killer films like ""Se7en"", ""Silence Of The Lambs"", ""Resurrection"", ""The Bone Collector"" or ""Red Dragon"".It's not perfect, but also not to be missed..",The House That Jack Built
67,treywillwest,nope,8,18 December 2018,"This feels like a final film, whether it will be or not, from Lars Von Trier. At any rate, it's definitely a culmination of many of the ideas and themes that have run through his films. Indeed, one could call it a self-deconstruction of the Von Trier style.
Von Trier's films have always teetered between the sadistic and the intellectual, sometimes blurring the line between the two. Here, there is no such blurring. This is probably the most purely sadistic, and the most blatantly philosophical film of the director's career. No one watching this film, however, can confuse the two. The first hour and 45 minutes or so are pure horror: a simple, sometimes sickening, sometimes darkly amusing, sometimes tedious series of murders by a serial killer named Jack who fancies himself an artist and intellectual. There are a few scenes during this section that seem to attempt to empathise with the inner life of a psychopath, but these are clumsily derivative of scenes from the television show, ""Dexter"", which one senses Von Trier has spent quite a bit of time watching.
One is almost ready to give up on the film, or at least I was, when it takes a complete twist towards the intellectual, becoming almost an essay-film. These last 45 or so minutes of film making might be the most brilliant of Von Trier's career. Von Trier characterizes his oeuvre, with its infamously unpleasant, sometimes sadistic style, as an attempt to create an art of pure negativity. He wants to affirm only the suffering of the flesh, and death itself. For it is death that constitutes the history of humanity and the greatest contributors to human culture, the greatest artists, then are those that bring about historical evolutions in mass slaughter. Von Trier has compared himself to Hitler when addressing the press, and Jack considers himself an artist of death akin to Hitler.
Jack, then, is Von Trier. And Von Trier's treatment of Jack in the film's final third is the director confronting himself as an artist. For Jack's mistake is that he UNDERESTIMATES the horror of life. Jack mistakes his mastery of that which is most commonplace and obvious, the suffering of humanity, for a sinister insight into something subterranean. What is rare and difficult, is rather to find anything affirmational in the grubby hell of existence, and this is something Jack, and Von Trier, are particularly incapable of doing.
For Jack is NOT an evil genius. His success as a serial killer is not the product of some supreme method but of dumb luck (or Divine Interference) and the indifference towards fellow humans that characterize American society. Jack essentially tries to turn himself in at one point, but the American people are too indifferent, or just too stupid, to respond. Von Trier gives Jack (himself) one last temptation towards a sense of transcendence, one he fools himself into thinking himself worthy of, and at which he fails miserably.
Of course, this self-evisceration on Von Trier's part is wholly ironic because the scenes in which it takes place are characterized by bona-fide artistic mastery. Few directors have ever created images possessed of such legitimately sublime, painterly beauty as Von Trier musters in these final scenes. The viewer feels intellectually challenged, entertained and strangely uplifted all at once. What had been an intentionally unpleasant film to watch has become something uniquely joyous, and it is the self-disgraced Von Trier who has accomplished this.",The House That Jack Built

70,TuesdayThe17th,The House That Jack Built 2018,10,16 March 2019,"This is truly an amazing experience. As an avid horror fan and an upcoming filmmaker, this is the movie the genre has been longing for. Us horror hounds occasionslly long for something extreme. Something tasteful. Something mind blowingly disturbing on a level that is still watchable. This movie achieves all of this plus more. Matt Dillon does give a career best performance and for him to not win an Oscar is absurd. Although this film is highly praiseable as well as very well put together unlike many other ambitious art films. Usually when a movie is made with such a level of ambitiousness it becomes confusing and the story line is a little scatter and random. However, Von Trier does not fall into this category because he is not ambitious, he IS the ambition. This is his cup of tea and he has done films on this level many times. As his second of third contribution the the horror genre, id say that Lars has developed quite a name for himself in the genre. The House That Jack Built is so intensely disturbing and unflinching but not in a gory way. Its watchable but the themes are what puts this movie in a beyond R rating category. This film is bold as all hell and Matt Dillon is super scary and intimidating. He is the perfect fit for the role. The movie also has such depth. I loved every second of it and it inspires me to create the best first film i could. At 2.5 hrs it is a very long movie. At about 75 minutes in it turns into more of an experience than a mocie viewing. Watching it all the way through in one sitting can be life changing. I personally believe this is the single best horror film of 2018 and will probably stand its ground through 2019 as well. U have to understand this movie does so much more than any other film. Its biggest feat in comparison is that it is the opposite of shallow. Most films are very shallow, made solely for the entertainment value with big explosions and loud sounds and fast paced ghostly sequences. This film is different. There is true feeling behind it and, again, as a writer and hopeful director, I dare U to try to find a single editing error here. I tried and there are none. Everythinf here is epic and unforgettable. Definitely the best film about a serial killer ecer made, and possibly the best horror film of the past decade. From my thoughts to urs, go watch it when the kids are in bed.",The House That Jack Built

Artistic Expression is something to celebrate not bottle up degrade and discard into an ocean of obscurity. Lars Von Trier the Director & Writer Is unequivocally a genius who does have a penchant to start his films a little rocky with a couple scenes that seem like the writing or acting is a little subpar sometimes both and if you treat his movies like any other filmmaker that starts off shabby and after 15 minutes you stop the film as I do on many occasions then you will undoubtedly miss something monumental that will develop as the story carries on.. Also you have to prepare your mind to watch something onscreen that naturally your mind and body will reject because it will be a Disturbing most likely very DISTURBING scene, scenario, situation whatever you wanna categorize it as but something will put you off, But in every film I've seen which is 80% of them Lars Von Trier is about some sort of Payback, balancing the scales or justice. Not all of them but most. What I can guarantee is if you watch closely you'll grasp some understanding seeing his riveting tales and truly appreciate his works of art. So those who enjoy films that push the envelope and are utterly disturbing like ""A Serbian Film"" or ""Salo 120 days of sodom"" then undoubtedly Lars Von Trier's ""The House That Jack Built"" Starring Matt Dillon will be among your favorites. Not to be confused with more than a dozen other films with the same title
this uneasy and awkward over the top onslaught about a serial killer who begins by narrating a confession to an unknown person about 5 different incidents is my favorite Lars film to date. Brilliantly done, Dillon gives an award winning performance with many scenes that were cringeworthy where I almost couldn't believe what I was watching. I won't give anything away but this film also contains some of the most beautiful and dreadful cinematography I ever watched. Written and directed superbly, Lars really out did himself with a storyline and conclusion that wraps everything up with a beautiful bow not leaving a bunch of unanswered questions like a lot of genius artsy film makers often do, It's a little out there at times but it's done in a smart witty sensical manner. I give this film a 9 and a must see for DISTURBING movie seekers. You've been warned. Check out ""Dancer In The Dark"" If you never have. One of my all time favorites.",The House That Jack Built

76,lucasnochez,Film Review: The House That Jack Built (Unrated Director's Cut)/www.nightfilmreviews.com,6,22 December 2018,"My relationship with Lars von Trier can be described best in one word; boundless. Luckily for myself, although my relationship only began a few days ago with this passionate and highly cynical director, I'm sure glad that a relationship flourished at all. While his name had been mentioned to me in passing countless times, I never really sat down and truly experienced a von Trier film, that is, until I watched The House That Jack Built. Yet, not like most, I experienced von Trier on a different level most people would, attending a very exclusive and rare unrated director's cut of Jack. To say the least, it is with all honesty and truth, I can say that it wasn't until I watched this film that I truly understood how far the boundaries of cinema can be pushed.Typical discussions regarding von Trier's work usually touch mostly upon the controversies surrounding his films, as well as his unprecedented style, and his penchant for making viewers feel so uncomfortable that their only natural reaction is to walk out of their theatre seat, or turn off the film altogether. While von Trier's career is ladened with controversy, including a ""persona non grata"" at Cannes, that was lifted this year for The House That Jack Built, as well as controversy for basically each one of his film's release since the beginning of his Depression Trilogy, starting with AntiChrist, von Trier seems to be the poster child for auteurs with aWhile very few directors can truly call themselves truly provocative filmmakers, and while it seems that von Trier spends more time debunking this notion that trying to prove himself otherwise, it isn't hard to reign him as the clear champion of this title. Yet, aside from the controversy, von Tirer has a plethora of qualities that he brings to filmmaking and cinema all together. Always pushing the boundaries, von Trier likes to smear the lines drawn by rating boards and society alike, and Jack is a testament to the very boundaries set by such films and people. While his content is often disturbing and brutal, von Trier also has a sadistic way of implementing a stark sense of humour within the frames of his work. Yet knowing all of these from a true vanguard of cinema, nothing could prepare me for a work made a man hated but loved by many so many people inside and outside of the film industry, and whose work is often misunderstood yet a direct companion piece of the man that is Lars Trier (he added the von himself).The House That Jack Built is quite elementary narratively speaking; the story follows Jack, an architect who has a severe case of OCD. Jack is played passionately by Matt Dillon, a role since The Outsider that many believed he was born to play, especially given his heavy encrusted facial expressions and naturally demonic and piercingly intimidating look. Yet, the more we get to know Jack, we realize he is a serial killer. Okay, maybe that's a lie; we know right away and before anything that Jack is a serial killer before he is anything else. So in proper von Trier fashion, the film is presented using chapters, over the course of twelve years, and within those twelve years, we are introduced to Jack and five murders that have shaped the man he is and becomes by the end of the film.Yet, as rudimentary the narrative of von Trier's film is, it becomes clear quickly that nothing is square about this auteur and his films. Jack's devilish narrative is a twisted odyssey into the depths of hell and a psychosis where guilt, empathy and compassion is voided. Yet, after these five incidents are displayed in bloody von Trier fashion, the journey of Jack's path leads to Verge (Bruno Ganz), a 'spiritual' figure who appears and disappears throughout Jack's life, proving truly von Trier'esque exposition; but keep in mind, von Trier exposition is quite different from Hollywood exposition. Presented in poetic and encrypted fashion, von Trier's dialogue is nothing short of enigmatic. And while Ganz is a formidable and heavyweight actor, Ganz's performance, no matter how insightful or mysterious it is, merely serves as a counterweight to the heavy hitting and aggressively spot-on performance given by Dillon. Jack is without question, Dillon best and quintessential role ever, and he will never be better in a film in his life.While Ganz and Dillon provide the film with some its most analytical, contemplative and philosophical dialogue, speeding through words in a rhythmic yet glaringly sophisticated way, as if written in iambic tetrameter, von Trier's dialogue still has an incomparable way of showing facets of the director and the many dark and disturbing pieces of himself, in a way that makes the film so personal and reflective. The director, as he does with all his films, shows a piece of himself and gives us a vulnerable look into the demons of his mind, heart and soul as well as exploring the deepest and darkest corners of his psyche. To witness a von Trier film is truly a journey into a disturbed and complex mind.Luckily for von Trier, there are many talented actors who are willing to explore these dark corners with him. Aside from Ganz, Jack also features some amazing performances from fresh new von Trier faces, as well as familiar ones. Siobhan Fallon Hogan, Sofie Gråbøl and Riley Keough give some of the best performances as murder victims we have seen in recent memory, as well as the always reliable and true von Trier muse Uma Thurman. With each death, comes a new fact about Jack and the past and current present of his mind state, as well as an audience understanding as to why he is a serial killer, the actions towards his choosing of his victims, and most importantly, what we find and share and familiarize ourselves with, a character so horrifying and grotesque, we try to reject the similarities. While many of the women featured (and eventually killed off, this is surely not a #MeToo sensitive film), have no back story or history, they do give Jack some of his most revealing moments. Yet, for almost three hours, its hard to just choose a hand few of moments in the film where we are truly blown away, because the majority of the film is an onslaught of memorable and truly immersive cinema. Simply put, The House That Jack Built may very well be von Trier's most audacious film to date.Narratively speaking, von Trier is unmatched by any of his cinematic peers. Yet, while most filmmakers may only have the style down-pact or the narrative touch, von Trier has easily be posed as a double threat. Stylistically, von Trier is a true visual talent, sometimes creating this notion that watching his films and not such beauty, even admits all the blood and gore, is a crime in itself. We build appreciation for his visual pallet quickly. Building off the violence and darkness, von Trier still finds a way for allowing audiences to build a sense of familiarity with his images and characters. Although perhaps, with Jack, our sense of familiarity may not be with the antagonists or victims, but perhaps with the world von Trier creates; a world plagued with violence, grisly news headlines a world sometimes completely spiralling into chaos and out of control.While von Trier's film can easily one pegged as 'fetish filmmaking', each one of his films themes all have their own harrowingly surrealist aspect to it. While Jack is focused around death and murder, von Trier's expectations to chew out crowd churning, drawn out, horrifying images is absolutely expected. Sprawling with close-ups, realistic special effects and terrifying make-up, the horror that Jack is manifesting is a manifestation of the real horrors plaguing our own world. Hazy, nightmarish and feverish, von Triers style of shooting in Jack, as well as his use of color, and lighting add a dash of hyper realism into our bloody cocktail lives.It is without question that Jack is a trouble man, yet throughout the whole runtime of the film, his intention is not to understanding a murderous mind. His actions aren't meticulous, despite his best efforts, he is not immortal any means, yet, unlike we've seen in many films before it, Jack plays upon the idea that maybe, sometimes, the bad guys get lucky too. Often avoiding the authorities, despite many meetings, the audience, often times, laughs at Jack's terrible blunders and crowning victories. Is this something we are proud of, I mean, if it wasn't von Trier, probably not, but its easy to root for the bad guy in a von Trier film I guess.While symbolism and music is a huge part of von Trier's world, von Trier never says away from his inspirations and images, including using one of his favourite artists in the soundtrack harmoniously, with David Bowie's song Fame providing the film with an unofficial anthem, even though one can't help but think that Bowie's I'm Afraid of Americans may very well be a more appropriate song choice, it just very well be too explicit for von Trier's liking. The auteur also surely gets inspiration for his zooms from a George Sherman film from the 1970's, von Trier never feels apologetic for honouring his idols and mentors, as well as an infamous and timeless Bob Dylan pop culture reference.With The House That Jack Built, von Trier proves many things, including that Cannes can easily change their mind, granting ""persona grata"" status now to the filmmaker, even if Jack had a reported hundred people walk out of the Cannes premiere. Lars von Trier also proves that you do not need to make films that people want to see, but make films that people need to see, slashing his way into the hearts of film-lovers, enthusiasts and cinephiles everywhere; cementing his position as an absolute cinematic genius, in the purest form.The House That Jack Built is a brilliant analytical look into the mind of a serial killer with little to hardly no answers, but a lot fo questions for its audience.

This film is designed to make you uncomfortable. Trier's objective is to get under your skin, and he succeeds perfectly. Unfortunately this film will be either a love/hate kind of movie. And for those who aren't aware, over a hundred people walked out at the Cannes Film Festival. Loads of people were disgusted by this film, but the film still received a standing ovation.Matt Dillon is brilliant here. This movie is definitely the best and bravest film he's ever done in his entire career. Walt Disney Pictures will never be hiring him from now on, that's for certain! What's surprising is that there is a lot of comedy through out the film. One example bring Jack pretending to be a Police Officer, telling the lady he forgot his badge and that it's getting polished at a car wash, then telling her he's a salesman ready to give her free money for her pension! The supporting cast are good, Uma Thurman is a stand out as always, Bruno Ganz (who plays Verge, the person he talks to about the murders he commits). The movie moves along at a good pace, sometimes even showing us real footage of animals or World War 2 with Jack explaining how we have animal instincts and how men are the lions and females are the innocent lambs.Lars Von Trier creates another cinematic masterpiece, but once again is not for everyone. This is a movie you will love or hate. To give you a few examples: there is animal cruelty, little kids dying on screen, over the top deaths in female victims, and even scenes of men getting slaughtered! This is not a movie for the faint of heart and you have been warned.5/5 stars
JayWhile I will admit that I'm not a huge devotee of Lairs Von Tier, his latest cinematic offering 'The House That Jack Built' is compelling, well written, visually confronting and has effective performances.The story and themes contained in the film will either shock you or have you interested; it involves around how one single person can become a solid killer based on his knowledge of how people interpret themselves and the urges to do something.But behind the camera there is a solid director, an interesting actor in the leading role and a worthy script. It's important to say that the casting of Matt Dillon is a huge step for him, whilst he may not be on our screens as much his return as a darkly sinister killer is something that the Oscars will definitely not consider for an nomination but I feel that this role in the film was indeed worth seeing.Regardless of what your tastes of film are like and if you know of Von Teir, THTJB is not a boring film as its brutal, well acted and visually shot but it's subject matter can either be depressing, too brutal or very interesting and sadly there will be those who will either love it or hate it.4/5Nick",The House That Jack Built

87,SimonD1900,Hilarious!,8,17 April 2021,"I've haven't seen all Von Trier films, but more then half. I have to assume that this movie is his most comedic effort, it definitely is within those I've seen of his so far anyway. Also, Matt Dillion completely makes this movie. This is a movie the academy wouldn't touch, not even with a very long stick, still Dillon's performances is truly Oscar worthy, he was perfect in this role, he was Jack, no one could have done it better. Funny, to be honest, I always thought of him as a very bad actor, terrible even, but he really shows here that he's grown into becoming much more rounded trough the years, there is much more depth and character to him.Now, if you watch this movie with a serious mindset and take it completely serious, it's just an awful film, a horrible horrible film. You might wonder: Why would someone make such madness and call it entertainment? Or even art? It has no real point, or has it? Well, if so, it's very vague. You might think: Is it a character study? Art hous? Or just a horror film? Is he making some sort of political message? Or perhaps religious? No, not really any of those, I myself believe anyway.To me, this is comedy. Yes, call me sick. But this is brilliant comedy. Very very very extremely dark comedy, but still comedy. It's just an crazy and absurdly macabre ride and Matt Dillion is insanely funny. No, the subject is no laughing matter, far from it. Still, this movie becomes weirdly funny. I have no idea how Lars Von Trier pulled that of. No, it's not the best movie ever, far from it, or even Trier's best, but it's a weird but good movie, I think anyway. Never seen anything like it really. Now, on the other hand, there is very few people, that I would even consider to recommend this to.",The House That Jack Built
88,Field78,"A look into the mind of an artist; the question is, which artist?",9,30 January 2019,"They often say that Lars von Trier is a matter of ""either love him or hate him"". I don't find that to be exactly true: I have rated his movies on either side of the scale, ranging from very good or at least interesting (Europa, Dogville, Antichrist, Melancholia) to mediocre or disappointing (Epidemic, The Kingdom, Dancer in the Dark). But it has to be said: even his failures can at least be considered ""interesting experiments"".So it was with less enthusiasm and more morbid curiosity that I went to see The House That Jack Built; having read about massive walkouts at Cannes, I was both fascinated and afraid that this was another Trier effort to be as vague, incoherent and shocking as he can possible be. The lady at the ticket office already warned me that this was the kind of movie where people may learn whether they are psychopaths or not, and also told me of other patrons unable to finish watching. I was surely up for something.So imagine my surprise that not only did THTJB turn out to be quite pleasant (save for some inspired nastiness), I also regard this as perhaps von Trier's best movie. His vision is clear throughout: he follows the life of serial killer Jack (Matt Dillon) during several of his 'incidents' (as his murders are euphemistically called), and makes great use of the dark comedic potential of these situations, such as when his victims seem to largely warrant their treatment, or where Jack screws up in the execution of his hobby. Such scenes could have been sickening, but von Trier maintains the right amount of emotional distance to make most of them bearable. A film like Funny Games, where we are much more connected with the victims, is much harder to watch in my opinion.What also helps is that Jack is in constant inner dialog with a person called 'Verge' (the always great Bruno Ganz). Jack explains his unusual hobby as artistry, with him being both architect and engineer. But perhaps due to his failure in building the ideal house, he resorts to creating art through murder, insisting that it is the product that counts, not the act of killing itself. This creates a fascinating dualism in the movie where we are quite aware of Jack's lack of empathy and humanity, but at the same time we gain some appreciation of his craft and root for him, though with reluctance and within certain limitsJack is very persuasive in his assertion that art and destruction often go hand in hand, and has quite some convincing historic parallels to illustrate this believe. In one of the film's best scenes, he draws a comparison between his murder art and how the best wine is made from decomposing fruit. The immorality of art arguably makes the film even more controversial than the shocking violence or dark humor itself. Those who have seen the Hannibal TV series know that death and mutilation can have a macabre esthetic.As said, the violence is quite graphic and hard to watch at times. Von Trier had ample opportunity to get sensationalistic here without explaining himself, but it is to his credit that he doesn't present the killings as overly sadistic (with perhaps a few exceptions), nor does he draw them out unnecessarily to the point of torture-porn. He also uses the dialog with Verge to comment (but not necessarily judge) on Jack's deeds, whereby it is subtly implied that Jack may not always be truthful, or that he hides behind artistic pretentions in order to mask feelings of misogyny, delusions or addiction to violence. Those conversations form the heart of the movie, for lack of a better word.There is a nice double layer here when von Trier brings forth the theory that violence in our art reflects the desires we cannot execute in real life. Since he also shows fragments from his own work, is this movie meant as a look into the auteur's own mind? Von Trier is no stranger to controversy regarding his subject matter, especially misogyny, so we could also view the movie as one big director's confession, without apology.I learned that some people have difficulties with the final 20 minutes, where things get less factual and more surreal. I liked this strange twist which heavily references Dante's Inferno, something that may be more off-putting for some than the violence. Whatever von Trier wants to say with the movie and especially this mind-bending epilogue, he found the perfect man to guide us through this journey in Matt Dillon, who has never been better and makes a Tarantino-style comeback here.The theme of making art out of destruction seems like a perfect metaphor for the film itself: creating sympathy for a monster and making him sound reasonable is certainly art, albeit of the uncomfortable kind. So kudos to the director for sticking with such a bold, controversial and unapologetic singular vision, and making this experiment work. If this is to be von Trier's last film as rumored, it is a worthy goodbye to one of Europe's last mad filmmakers.",The House That Jack Built

Not the uncut version though, but the rated R version, which is four minutes shorter, and I have to say that it looks kind of extreme with all the violence and I'm not sure what scenes have been cut out. It's an awesome psychotic serial killer drama with Matt Dillon giving an Oscar-worthy performance as Jack. The House That Jack Built is a disturbing cinematic masterpiece. It's funny, it's artistic, it's violent and is not a film for the squeamish. It has 5 chapters with lots of dark humor, violence and also the craziest epilogue with a powerful message. Moreover, there are great performances by Uma Thurman, Riley Keough and Bruno Ganz.

It is kind of interesting visually, like a weird painting, however it lacks depth. It felt pretentious but didn't provoke any thoughts for further discussion.

Other ratings from this person for example. Eyes wide shut 1,
Interstellar 3, Game of thrones 1, The lobster 1, The Blair Witch project 1, Psycho 2. But something like the Gremlins or Top Gun is a 10 for this person.
I liked the movie. Kept me interested. It was even funny at some points. So absurd. I was wondering what's going to be the end. Who's the other guy.
I have to admit that the ending was not good for the movie. I did understand it but it was too much and didn't work out with the movie.
So those that liked this movie have a good taste and are intelligent. Those that didn't prefer to watch a Marvel movie over something like The Godfather. I'm a 100% sure. It's just the way it is.
That's why Roma generated only $3m. People don't like good movies.

I was expecting a little more shock and awe from it, but it was pretty average. Borderline boring, actually.While one reviewer on here says that they found the last 20 minutes to be kinda dumb, I actually thought it was the best part. Its certainly out of place for the movie, but its really cool. It jumps into more of a fantasy scenario where he is being guided through hell, and there is some really awesome imagery.

117,BestBenedikt,Lars von Trier in his pure form,8,8 December 2018,"As usual with Lars von Trier films, I can't really say that I enjoyed THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT - but it's definitely not a bad film and a very interesting cinematic experience.The way the film is structured (the so-called ""incidents"") feels quite similar to NYMPHOMANIAC, except this time the taboo breaking happens on the basis of violence and not sex. While I felt that NYMPHOMANIAC was definitely dragging at times however, I was never bored watching Matt Dillon kill people and discuss the nature of art with Bruno Ganz' voice in his head for two and a half hours.Now, is this film inhumanely violent and disgusting at times? Definitely. But it all feels like von Trier actually has something to say. The violence portrayed here isn't just part of the film for the sake of morbid entertainment, unlike HOSTEL or this year's APOSTLE for example. The director raises very interesting questions about art, the human psyche and society's moral code throughout the film.On the other hand, telling the story of a psychopathic serial killer from his point of view feels very much like von Trier performing psychotherapy on himself. The giant ego of the director also occasionally shines through and influences the film in a strange way, with von Trier literally showing clips of his own films while making a point about high art.While von Trier's egomaniacal way of directing films lately can be annoying at times and the ending of THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT is definitely quite clumsy and less ambitious than the rest of the film, the positive aspects still outweight the negative ones for me. This is certainly one of the most interesting films of the year.",The House That Jack Built

Even the action is derivative and difficult to pay attention to. There is some good acting and it is shot well, but that does not save it from being boring. By the time I got to the end, all I wanted was for it to finally be over with. But instead it just limps alongs even slower to a completely nonsensical finish.

127,spewy29167,"Revolting, pompous and gratuitous.",4,15 December 2018,We have fictional Jack. He's supposed to be a psychopath serial killer.Unfortunately the director also seems to be a psychopath and the whole film remains sub-zero in charisma and interest. Either understand the victims or the killer and their motivations. It's not enough to suggest the killer is the way he is because he's odd.Dillon and many of the cast play their parts very well and the filming is very good.

If only because of the greatness of his previous films, this deserves in depth critical analysis, if only to confidently regard it as a grotesque and pretentious insult to its audience. It is anti-genre in its interspersing hip serial killer antics with banal dialogue, it is anti-morality in its nihilistic emptiness, it is anti-art as it justifies itself repugnantly while simultaneously tearing itself down, and it is anti-it's audience, Lars Von Trier begging to not be taken seriously anymore.",The House That Jack Built
129,RustyShacklefordd,Pretentious Garbage,1,1 January 2019,"The only thing shocking about this movie was how pretentious and boring it was.Matt Dillon was trying his best here, but his character was one-note and got old quickly. The premise here is an intersting one, but quickly goes off the rails as it devolves into a pretentious art-house film that mostly consits of laughbly mad monologues that feel like they were written by a goth theater major who smoked way too much pot. While the violence here certainly is gruesome, it's not nearly as bad as other reviews have made it out to be and gets tiresome quickly.I truly struggled to get through this as the 2 and a half hour running time was painful and did not justify itself at all.

132,DrCCat,Revenge fantasy,2,29 May 2021,"If you are into revenge fantasies with pseudo psychology thrown in, this movie is for you. First I'd like to say that the cops in the movie are unbelievably stupid. They are so bad they couldn't catch a cold.For example: a cop shows up in the area because the cop are investigating a breakin. The cop stops the killer to question him, if you can call it that. At no point did the cop ask the killer, what's your name? The officer does ask why he's there & after a flimsy excuse, suspicious behavior, and a mystery truck with blacked out windows he lets the killer, Jack, go.Meanwhile, in the part w/ jacks girlfriend, the killer is walking around on crutches, something Ted Bundy did, and he spooks his girlfriend. Unluckily officer mouth-breather is there to provide zero tension as Jack admits to being a serial killer. He should have arrested Jack right there or at brought him in for questioning, since it's been established that the police are looking for a serial killer.Speaking of serial killer, the term didn't gain mainstream acceptance till the late 70s and people throw it out and often. Lars can't stop reminding the audience that the main character is a serial killer. Did I mention that Jack was a serial killer? Repeat ad nauseam.Instead of developing anything original: U2 video cards with words, meta moment (similar to House of Cards), mom caused all my problems trope, ripping off Ted Bundy, obvious Saw-like shock tropes, enough plot contrivances to fill an Ocean's movie, and faux psychology references from a freshman's entry lvl psychology book, Lars fails to bring anything new to the serial killer genre.

138,pronins,FROM AN EXPERT HORROR FAN....,2,12 April 2019,"Just to make it clear: my low rating has nothing to do with violence/gore depicted in this movie, it's not nearly as shocking as people say, it's a commercial trick to get you to watch it, so don't trust these rumors. Actually, I don't mind violence or even extreme gore, as long as it is justified in some way, whether it is for effective shock value, dark humor, some sort of catharsis, etc. In the case of Lars Von Trier, this film, just like Antichrist, is a pretentious and boring melodrama. As a huge fan of Tarkovsky, I can clearly see that Trier tries to ""reproduce"" Tarkovsky's style in every movie with seemingly-philosophical ideas, elements of mysticism, slow pacing, even camera work. Watch Tarkovsky's Sacrifice (1986) and you will see what I mean. In fact, Trier even dedicated Antichrist to Tarkovsky. The difference is that Tarkovsky's style wasn't fabricated, he was a true, profound artist. Trier's work is merely a poor attempt at art, lacking true depth and integrity. Obviously Trier is a very educated man, but all the ""extra"" information in his movies is presented in an almost condescending way, as if he assumes that the audience is made up of people who don't know anything about literature, science, music or art. There is a way to present the same ""educational"" information in a much more interesting and tactful manner (Re: Tarkovsky, for example). Anyway, here are a few final thoughts: It is possible to make a gory film that is simply a shock-value-oriented experience (A Serbian Film, Human Centipede, etc.) Such films don't aim for higher aesthetic values - they are what they are, and are aimed at a specific audience, as with any genre. One can certainly make a deep, psychological thriller or a philosophical art-film, either of which also target specific and very different audiences. Trier tries hard to ""navigate"" between genre in order to appeal to everyone in some way, from the common man to the art connoisseur, which is practically impossible, unless you're someone like Mozart (which Trier certainly is not). As a result, he makes films that have no actual depth or substance, and are deceivingly ""provocative"" due to the use of gratuitous sex and violence. Just to remind everyone: Salo, Cannibal Holocaust, Men Behind The Sun, Ichi The Killer, and many other films were made years before this poorly-executed serial-killer flick, so how is it shocking at all to anyone watching it today, even just in terms of its violence ""meter""?! This is just PR to get you to see it, so don't waste your time. The only reason I gave it 2/10 instead of 1/10 is because the actors are quite decent and the quality of the cinematographic craftsmanship is notable in some instances. Other than that, whether you're looking for something profound or simply a gore-fest, just watch something else.",The House That Jack Built

I don't care about the killer or any other characters or their motives and they don't let you. I've seen way too many movies so I don't fall victim to the shock factor. I don't even know how I feel about the acting. Just a boring artistic film.,The House That Jack Built
140,rune-andresen,Excessive use of violence - The meaning disappear in the violence,5,19 May 2019,"I love the darkness and the reflections in several of the Von Triers movies. However, excessive use of violence (this movie) and sex (anti christ, nymfomaniac) make the latest movies a bit one dimensional and tedious.The subtle and all layers of depression that emerged in melancholia or dancer in the dark disappear. The need to shock exaggerates the message.There is a bit of self-torment type kafka and inner demons that are good but disappear in the violence",The House That Jack Built

There a little dark humour scattered in there just to lighten the feel and that works well, even when the violence is peaking in certain scenes its done in a easy digestable way which makes it ok.. and it never feels shocking or over the top, it just feels normal. So to LVT's credit he has created a perfect serial killer movie .. putting you there to share the great work of this 'artist' without feeling like a peeping tom ""which a lot of serial killer movies can make you feel"" like Henry did.. although i'd admit i liked Henry more and it had a different impact.I would have voted higher than a 8, but the end was a little let down, I wanted to see a little more of the HELL .. but artistic impression ran out of ideas.",The House That Jack Built

145,alvesmarceloalves-73751,Lars von Trier and his eternal misogyny,6,7 January 2019,"Lars von Trier thinks there is no story that does not deserve to be told. Starting from this premise, the Danish director, one of the exponents of the Dogma movement, walks through the most obscure places of the soul in search of the rottenest in humanity. ""The house that Jack built"", can be seen as a summary of everything that has been his cinema in the last decades. It is also 2h35min of a movie that only he would reaffirm his critics' view of his sickly misogynist behavior and his flirtations with extremism, and remember that Von Trier has already stated ""to understand Hitler"", which made him expelled from Cannes when the ""Melancholy"" (2011) was released.""The house Jack built,"" can therefore be seen by at least two prisms. Let's start with the first one.Von Trier's new film can be seen as an exercise in evil without consequences. In the story, Matt Dillon is Jack, an engineer with ambitions to be an architect who dreams of building a house so perfect that it always seems impossible to build it. But Jack is also a serial killer, who in 12 years killed more than 60 people without ever being caught by the police.Throughout the film, Jack is developing a theory in a conversation with an entity called Verge (Bruno Ganz) about how artistic his life of crime is. He argues that art comes from pain and evil as Verge understands art as the fruit of love. This dialogue of oppositions is mapping the whole film to each increasingly heinous act of Jack, always accompanied by the attentive but placid look of Verge, a character that only in the end we understand what the role is. And it is curious that this character was made by the same actor who played Hitler in ""Der Untergang"" (2004). Hard to believe it was a casual choice.With each murder of Jack, Von Trier goes on to illustrate how evil is banal and how desperate each one is so lonely and finds no echo and no solidarity. He is the Lord Sophistication and develops perfect crimes as long as the population inoperative around and the slowness of the authorities.At the same time, Von Trier develops the thesis that the serial killer is an individual who is born with evil in him and always leaves clues to every crime. For he wants to be found, discovered. There is a vanity in this fight of cat and mouse, because the killer at some point wants to be discovered to have his ""work of art"" finally disclosed and gaining public and notoriety.At the same time, the director exposes that we, as spectators, worship these stories and adulate murderers. It is when the director exposes the images of dictators and mass murderers like Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin.The film, however, ends up dripping in the end by a long biblical strand that seemed to disagree somewhat with the initial proposal. Had he kept the subtlety of the conversations between Jack and Verge with a less long ending, he would have something better to offer.But it is impossible to see ""The house Jack built"" on another prism. A of von Trier's misogyny. In the film, Jack says he murdered all kinds of people, but it's the story of six women he decides to tell Verge, the ones who give him some pleasure. One of them, he considers his great work of art, when he treats a mother and his two small children as a hunt and drops them in a field just to play with them. But it is the woman he decides to torture psychologically before offering her a tragic end.Von Trier is a well-known torturer of women and seems to have no problem in exposing this. In a passage of the film, when Jack is about to kill Simple (Riley Keough), name that by itself is a great aggression and reductionism to the woman that he said until liking, the director comes to expose a subtext in the script speaking of the injustice that is always blame men for everything, while women are always victims. In times complaints of harassment and a necessary call to female protagonism, Von Trier comes to tell us that he does not care about this. So that does not expose a need to be controversial only by the controversy in something that adds nothing to the film?Simple is verbally assaulted, humiliated and has the most dreadful and sadistic of deaths. And that reverberates during the film, because Jack turns one of his breasts into a wallet.But as I said, von Trier is a well-known torturer of women in the movies. Nicole Kidman is humiliated beyond the limit in ""Dogville"" (2003), causing a huge nuisance. Chalotte Gainsbourg is also taken beyond all boundaries in ""Antichrist"" (2009) and in the two volumes of ""Nymphomaniac"" (2013). Björk is also humiliated in ""Dancing in the Dark"" (2000). The Icelandic singer, even, had problems of relationship with the director. And in ""The House Jack Built,"" Von Trier exposes his women to the utmost of pain and horror. Not just with Simple or one of the nameless women, but also with the first victim (Uma Thurman), murdered with a monkey blow while the director makes a point of exposing the huge hole in the head of the character caused by the car part.Some might say, and it is a valid argument, that it is all the art of Von Trier. That the actresses keep bumping into working with him and in the case of Charlotte, they make even more than one movie. But when it comes to stop being something punctual to become a brand, and an uncomfortable brand, as it is not a style trait, but a hate speech imputed in their work, becomes a problem.Thus, ""The House Jack Built"" does not add anything too new to Von Trier's biopic, which continues releasing its Dogma-style sparks to film, and making their stories follow the same narrative looping of earlier works. Interesting is Dilon's work in the leading role. If there's a spark of value in the film, it's in the sadistic-boring look he set for his Jack and the benefit he had from the ironies of the text to use in his character. But still, ""The house Jack built"" is far from the best works of Von Trier.",The House That Jack Built
146,nirome,House built on shaky foundations,5,31 January 2019,"Must be honest. Never been a great admirer of Von Trier's work. His movies have a tendency to be discursive, with very unlikable characters and very hard subject matter. This one is no different. By the hand of a magnificent Matt Dillon, we are treated to the dubious honour of following his main character's serial killer career during a 12 year span in five different and very grousome incidents. Along the way we're being constantly taken on a tangent via endless two- way conversations with a mysterious interlocutor who goes by the name of Verge, in an attempt to liken serial murder with art and the constant struggles of the main protagonist to build a house of his own that never come to fruition until the very end. And man, does it take a long time to get there. Aside from the violent and disturbing nature of the movie, a constant in Von Trier's career, it takes too long to tell its story, it's meandering and highly narcissistic( there are several scenes from his previous movies which are shown at one particular point of the movie) and his ''artistic' ' finale is highly debatable.

This is not my favorite Lars Von Trier film but I still found it to be a great film. It's a long film that does seem to drag a bit narrative wise in places upon the first viewing. Though like most of his films every detail has a meaning and I will have to rewatch this film to fully appreciate it. Is this film for everyone? No. If you enjoyed his previous films then you will probably enjoy Triers' latest film. Also if you don't mind films with unconventional structure & imagery many would find grotesque (What can be considered art is the main question posed by the film).

155,TheAlmightyFinger,Very odd experience,7,3 May 2019,"Well, I am not particularly fond of slasher/gore movies, or ones about serial killers. I find Lars von Trier films difficult to watch, even if he is undeniably brilliant.This film, however, was quite gripping for several reasons. If there is one director that can effectively portray the mind of a serial killer, then it would have to be an unconventional, uncompromising director like Lars von Trier.Pros: Matt Dillon nails it as a remorseless, highly intelligent individual. You get to understand and abhor his total indifference to suffering. The film does not glorify his sickness or revel in his shocking deeds. It shows how a monster can exist and thrive in an uncaring, self-absorbed society, and also demonstrates the silliness and mundanity of narcissistic self-gratification.The editing, visuals and acting are excellent. Pacing is fine, with one or two slight lags.Cons: The camerawork was good, but had some unnecessary shakiness in some parts, and there is one scene where the camera movement had a psychopathy of its own. There is some bitingly dark humor, but it is probable that not many people would appreciate it.Overall I can understand that the brutality of the film, mirrors the brutality of the main character. It is definitely not a family outing. If you are game for an intelligent dissection of what makes a psychopath tick, I think you would enjoy this.",The House That Jack Built

On top of that there were several incidents during the movie where I believe that Jack would have been caught in any other crime story or at least lead to that he would have been caught much sooner.

Maybe the character himself basically commentating why he was doing it sort of destroyed the intrigue. I love thought provoking movies and I believe it gave too much away with the character describing each scene.
Philosophically the movie loses momentum in the last few scenes trying to portray killing and art as similar but unless you're a psychopath we will never know why they kill and in a way nor will they.",The House That Jack Built

Mental derangement seems to hold some special fascination for filmmakers, and while this director has released some thought provoking films, this one eludes me. And bores me senseless. Guess I wasn't in the mood for another dose of nihilism this time, although I'm sure someone will upbraid me for failing to see the ""true genius of the artist at work.""

162,mnogogaloshi,Unjustifiably pretentious and somewhat lazy,5,24 December 2020,I'm not entirely sure what exactly Von Trier was going for with this one.

However, the overtly sensational scenes are hard to watch and a distraction to a story that seems to have been a stitching together of ideas rather than a coherent narrative leading to a rational conclusion. The idea that he is a robbery suspect, not a murder suspect fits an allegorical meaning but is not natural to the content of the film. Lars never tried to fix this issue with the script and this was careless to his viewer. So, while displaying his genius, Lars von Trier again spectacularly disappoints.",The House That Jack Built
164,mateusolivotti,A perfect portrait of a psychopath,6,29 October 2020,"The House Jack Built is a film by director Lars Von Trier, released in 2018. The film tells the story of Jack, a serial killer who has killed over sixty people over twelve years. Jack tells his story divided into five incidents, as they are called, for the mysterious Verge.The film mixes black humor and suspense in a way that works well, it is definitely not a film for everyone, due to its acid humor and extreme violence, it is very difficult for me to be impressed with the violence in the cinema, however, it has a moment in third act that was difficult to watch, however, I see much more as a quality of the resource, as it seeks to shock and succeeds very well.
Matt Dillon's performance is excellent, for me, the best performance of his career, and Bruno Ganz is also very well in the film.The House Jack Built is a film that impresses with violence, with great performances, but sometimes predictable and that sometimes gets lost trying to put philosophy in everything, which is sometimes forced and pretentious.",The House That Jack Built

I thought it was going to be fun to watch a serial killer kill in a Dexter kind of joyous way (Uma's character deserved to be murdered within the 5 minutes we got to know her). But then 10 minutes into it the entire endeavor tanked. BIG TIME. We weren't asked to suspend disbelief to go with the plot. We were expected to suddenly be lobotomized to go with the crap presented.

166,Miasmakoala,The Hell that Lars Explained,4,2 April 2019,"The House that Jack Built starts very abruptly. First incident felt really weird. If Uma Thurman would've looked straight into the camera while talking then it could've felt a bit more natural. Her awkward hostility towards Matt Dillon felt really shallow and artificial. What is going on? Is this a movie? I thought to myself that I am simply thinking too much of what's happening and how it is happening and what is the film trying to tell me.I tried to relax and immerse myself with the story.I couldn't. Everything that happens on screen is explained out loud, like it was a middle finger pointed at the viewer trying to think about anything. I am certain that I am not sophisticated enought to understand all the concepts and ideas the movie deals with.The second incident has some good elements of storytelling but Lars' obsession with a Bob Dylan music video interrupts the scene. Every time Jack tries to leave the house, his OCD is portrayed very nicely, but also explained at the viewer the moment they show it. It was really frustrating.I tried to figure what is going on. The movie made no sense. What is Lars von Trier trying to tell the audiences?The only plausible explanation I came up with is that Jack is Lars himself. Not in the literal sense, but all the ideas that Jack tells to the narrator, Verge, sounded so deeply personal and still conflicting with Jack's actions. It was almost like the stuff he did was just a fantasy, and then I thought, that maybe Lars tries to communicate with the audiences about his most personal thoughts on art, cinema, history, human condition, lust, power, etc. He even shows his clips from his own movies.The House that Jack Built almost redeemed itself towards the end. It wasn't going to be a good movie for me, but still, worth the silly explanations and way too long runtime. The final scenes, where Jack sees the unreachable fields of Elysium and the uncrossable chasm out of Hell.Everything in the end comes into the final conclusion that no matter what a person is chasing, the chase will devour the chaser, because humans are limited beings. The House must be a metaphor for Lars' career, his life, or his own limitedness (mortality).Matt Dillon does a great work here. The music was nice. Still it's way too long and the ending is just as silly as the events leading towards the end. The script feels like it was written in one sitting and purposefully left that way, without changing anything.",The House That Jack Built

With masterful films such as Dancer in The Dark, Breaking The Waves, Antichrist and Melancholia.Chances are, you're not going to like The House That Jack Built, and Von Trier really paints it thick with the brutality and sadism. But for all the trolling and shock, Von Trier lays on, there is a beautiful film here, pushing the boundaries of the artform. I've never seen a film like this, I've never felt so uncomfortable laughing at a film. It's hysterically funny but also incredibly disturbing. Matt Dillon took a real chance here with role that would either cement him in greatness or ruin his career.
David Bowie's ""Fame,"" blaring in between scenes of grizzly murder, with Jack mobbin' through town in his red van, to throwing heaps of bodies in a commercial walk in freezer, to watching him build a house, and then literally descend through hell. Holy cow, this one is insane, it's gripping and engaging and challenging but it's absolutely worth it.
Not for the easily offended or faint of heart, I can't wait to see everyone lose their minds, this will be the most hated film of 2018.So many fragmented thoughts...I need to digest further.",The House That Jack Built
181,jramalho,Provocative and Genius? Grandiose Narcissistic Crap? YOU be the judge.,6,22 December 2018,"It's certainly well worth watching, and the reasons for the range of Reviews shown here will be obvious. The shots are beautiful and intense, Matt Dillon is great, and the voice of Bruno Ganz in the background is nothing short of hypnotic.
There is gore, but this is certainly no horror film (in a ""classical"" sense, at least), or even a serial killer film. The story (if you wish to call it that) is basically a vehicle for long tirades on the nature of life, art, death, cruelty, immortality, isolation; the Human Condition in general. Interspersed with a variety of quotes that will either interest or annoy, but likely will not leave you indifferent. Yes, von Trier is, as usual, constantly trying to show how clever he is, and that can be tiring, especially with a story as basic as this one actually is. But the point is he often IS very clever, and delivers well-known messages in an original way.
I really loved certain scenes (the hunting ""incident"", for example), but was royally pissed off by others (notably what I felt were some of the aforementioned gratuitous quotes, from Glenn Gould to William Blake to Bob Dylan), which made the film too heavy handed, in my opinion.",The House That Jack Built
182,dnabney,The movie that made me give up completely on Lars von Trier,1,20 December 2018,"I made it through about a quarter of this movie. The scenes with Uma Thurman were amusing, I will give it that. But Jack was boring. The storytelling was boring. We were given no background on Jack's second victim other than that she often walks down the street. Jack is not ""brilliant."" He is not ""interesting."" I have attempted to watch three Lars von Trier films now, and I was unable to finish this one and Nymphomaniac. I did finish Antichrist, but I was unimpressed. I honestly think that anyone who likes von Trier likes ""finding meaning"" in things that don't actually have a meaning - they are pulling importance and meaning out of their butts. Also, he is clearly a misogynist.",The House That Jack Built
183,davidklein-06399,"Very dark, at times silly, and cerebral",7,4 February 2019,"Really, this movie is more about philosophy than a serial killer. The serial killer motif is so cliched, it serves as wrapping-paper and hides the director's true intention and message - in motioning the audience toward morality-themed classics written works such as those written by Virgil in the Aeneid (in particular) and the circles of hell.It's a high-brow endeavor which will require at least a college education or a dictionary to follow thoroughly.

185,Concorde2512,Depressive age.,6,19 December 2018,"I generally do like the serial killers movies, and here Matt plays more than convincing. I do not mind the cruelty of the murders, nor the sick imagination that Matt's character is trying to materialize, bringing sadism to the limit of supportability by the viewer. It was the narcissistic desire of the director to shock the viewer and, above all, the intermingling of the scene of the slaughterhouse with the artistic creation and the attempt to offer the philosophical connotations of the sadistic actions of a psychopath who is sitting on a pile of corpses, that depressed me.Now I need a fine comedy to cheer me up.",The House That Jack Built

It is not possible to pinpoint his ""peak"". Was it around the time of Dogma and Breaking the Waves? Or is it now?
Think about that. Pretty amazing. THTJB feels very personal. I think this might be an autobiography of LVT's inside the last few years, repacked as a movie about somebody else. 
And based on the humour in the movie it also shows that LVT is in a good stage of his own healing process. (If you read into his state of mind and health during Antichrist and Melancholia, you know what I am talking about). Is it too long? Does it go to far in a trashy way sometimes?
Yes to both.

It is genuinely uncomfortable to watch and I would not recommend watching it unless you can swallow down gruesome themes.Being a 2.5 hour movie, I definitely could not bring myself to watch it in one sitting.

190,Ska4Live,Five shades of Red.,7,9 December 2018,"If you had a fetish on this color, after this movie you will look differently on it. Red brings variety to the kill and to the every scene with it.
The author makes a fun of other directors and actors(Actresses to be specific) in 5 episodes of Jack's life. Here, and Uma Thurman, who was supposed to be quite recently in her mission to ""Kill Bill"". Like in Tarantino movies she has this long and annoying dialogues, when she managed to knows Jack more as a friend and good Samaritan or provoke him to murder. SPOILER ALERT - she managed the second. And there is Sophie Grobel, known for the Danish detective series ""Murder"", here she is playing a naive mother of two children, whose become a targets for hunter-maniac.
In dialogue between Jack and Verge, you can actually hear conversation between director (Lars von Trier) and Public (in face of: critics; journalists, organizations, and audience in cinema).
Jack in fact - is Von Trier, but under other lighting. Maniac's photo art performances were made using negative photo method, which is a try to attempt by the Director to show his own works.
In general, the film in some form is the director's self-portrait. All of his previous works are collected here, all the criticism of which he has been abused in recent years is also described in each of the 5 stories. The House - which Jack is trying so hard to build, all the time is demolish in the early stages of construction, without completing the job more than 50%. Just as every director new work was smashed to smithereens at film contests, preventing the wide audience from accepting a film without criticism from ""white elite people"", so Jack sees his house as ideal only on paper and mock up, but when it comes to building - all plans are failing apart.
And for the last. Yes, this film does contain scenes of violence not previously seen in films by a Danish director. But these scenes are not so brutal as these we are used to seeing in the news every evening.",The House That Jack Built

192,leishayoung,I've long thought that Von Trier is taking the proverbial 'piss'...,6,22 August 2019,"...at least some of the time. And this film has just sealed the deal for me.This film is a mess, and NO! It's not because I don't ""get it"".There are plenty of people who will watch this film and pretend it actually means something...but it doesn't.Like I said, I honestly believe that Von Trier has graduated to a point in his career where he is just entertaining HIMSELF.That is, he is just writing and directing absolute trash, but with the most provocative, yet 'artistic' imagery he can muster, and then observing the reaction....and good luck to him. I mean, he has 'A-grade' actors clambering to appear in his films, so why not?Regardless, through all of the 'vagary', Matt Dillon does actually find a way to produce a very visceral and poignant performance with, what appears to be, very little direction; but, for all of Dillon's efforts, does it all actually mean anything?Make no mistake, it IS Matt Dillon who elevates this film from absolute tripe to something worth watching, and with the glimmer of hope that there is some 'meat-on-the-bone' for all the audience is asked to endure.However, ultimately, this film just comes off as a 'vanity project' for Von Trier, and not because he seeks to explore humanity, and what makes us 'tick', but rather for his own amusement, and to test how far he can go before someone asks the question: ""is Lars Von Trier just taking the piss?"".Well, I've been asking that question for years, and this film has FINALLY given me my answer.",The House That Jack Built

199,loveminuszero000,"Don't watch in darkness, especially with a headache.",5,22 December 2018,"I found the quality of this movie to be severely lacking. The plot, I can get behind, even the philosophical meanderings on morality, but the audio was horrible, especially during the conversations that were supposed to be integral to the movie, and the lighting in the cuts was a atrocious. I would have to watch the entire movie again with closed captioning just to get all of it. I'm not willing to do that. The sound would go from being so low, you couldn't hear it, to that obnoxious guitar riff blowing out your eardrums. It was the same with how they chose to use light and dark, it gave me a headache. The spinning camera scene combined with strobe like lights literally made me sick. Funny enough, those scenes all seemed to take place during the philosophizing.I almost felt like the writer didn't have faith in his own words and was trying to prevent the audience from hearing or paying attention. I liked some of the movie. I enjoyed some of what he was trying to convey. I couldn't hear enough of it to review it beyond that. I completely gave up when his imaginary friend appeared. I'm giving it a five because parts of the movie are worth watching but parts are complete rubbish. I wouldn't give the filmmaker the satisfaction of polarization, I think mediocrity hurts more. Matt Dillon shined though.",The House That Jack Built
200,pskachova,"Shockingly violent doesn´t always mean art, and big names don´t always make a big film",3,7 April 2019,"I like Lars von Trier and I saw most of his movies. He definitely signs his movies with his typical modus operandi. In this case, it´s impossible to avoid confrontation with Haneke´s Funny Games - the realistic and raw violence, and acting with pure foolness in mind without really having a reason to kill those unlucky folks.
Still, I must say that I enjoyed much more Funny Games (both in Haneke´s original version and in the new one with Naomi Watts and Tim Roth).
In this case, Trier showed off too much violence, too many repetitions and the acting of the main character was just too predictable to be genius. You see - when there´s too much of something, it just kind of loses its effect. You must use certain elements wisely, randomly without exageration, otherwise the final result is just a bunch of desgusting scenes.
Sometimes Trier managed to be funny and ironic, but I admit that I left the cinema in the middle of the movie - at the scene when the mother had to feed her mutilated sons. That scene particularly was too much for me, and useless in my opinion, and it was the last drop. Even if I saw many more rawer horors, I couldn´t stay this movie.I also admit that I did not like Matt Dillon. He did not convince me and I would give this role rather to Kevin Spacey or Edward Norton. Dillon´s interpretation gave me nothing and his face showed no particular acting emotions.So there are many reasons why I would not watch this movie again. And if you like interesting and intelligente narrative, you might be disappointed this time. Uma Thurman had such a stupid role here that I could not beleive it. She acted and said things almost without reason - everyone would kill her!This time it´s a NO for me.",The House That Jack Built

Von Trier's artistic narcissism is blatant especially in the last 15 minutes of Jack's decent into the Inferno and was the least appreciated moment of the movie.
Aside from this pretentious scene, the movie is a masterpiece and should be watched with great caution (for those who are offended by the SFX effects and deranged killings).",The House That Jack Built

The House That Jack Built promised 'unnecessary violence' but I'm afraid it had nothing of the sort. I love gore/violence and was left deeply unsatisfied by this.I liked the idea of showing 5 murders, and I was slightly tense throughout some of the scenes but the rest of the movie dragged so much it didn't make it worth it. If it was shorter and more graphic it would have been a lot better, but knowing how much Lars Von Trier loves dialogue and the arty side of a movie I guess I can't be surprised.Oh, and the last 20 minutes are very odd.

216,niko-oinonen,It's alright not to feel invigorated after seeing The House That Jack Built,8,15 March 2019,"The House That Jack Built isn't the sort of movie you go see to spend a couple of hours to have a good time. You certainly will be exposed to some vile imagery and acts of violence and thoughts. So maybe it's alright to leave a movie like this feeling rather disgusted than satisfied and invigorated.We follow Jack as he speaks in darkness to a man. They're on a journey to somewhere. He recounts five incidences he has chosen randomly. In them Jack murders people, mostly women in horrifying ways. You might argue against Jack claim that the incidents have been chosen randomly. The first incident involving a woman with a flat tire and a broken jack (Jack, jack, clever) differs from the rest in the sense that it doesn't seem planned. The woman just keeps pushing Jack's patience more and more until finally he hits her with the jack. It could be argued that this was the first time he killed since the walk- in freezer he stores the bodies in is at this time empty less the piles of frozen pizzas he bought from the previous owner. In the other four incidences, Jack clearly has an intent to murder from the get-go.In between these incidences and sometimes during them Jack discusses art, poetry and many things more with his not yet seen mysterious escort. Jack interprets art and art in a twisted way. He sees mankind in worst possible way. People are not good. They're selfish, stupid and afraid of expressing what they truly fantasize of. Jack himself is an engineer and an architect who attempted to build his own house, but his own limited imagination and his OCD resulted him never being satisfied with his work. So, he ended up demolishing his building no less than four? Times. He talks about the art in destruction and ruins, things like religion and love are of little value to him.Jack himself doesn't feel any empathy towards others. He practises basic friendly facial expressions in front of a mirror. He himself too is hard to empathize with. His theories on humanity and art and its relation to his murders are so twisted and sadistic that it's hard to find any aspect of him that you could relate with.There's one other thing missing from The House That Jack Built that many other films about serial killers has; there's really no counter balance to Jack. Usually there's a cop or a detective who provides a moral counterpart to the killer. Sure, there's the mysterious escort Verge, but he isn't there to stop Jack. In fact, he's the one who suggests Jack to build his house from very unusual material, albeit very fitting and poetic for a serial killer, when Jack is at the end of his road. Verge even complements Jack on the house, saying that it's a fine little house and absolutely usable. He does argue against him, and even one time tells him to stop when discusses the value of icons and the subject of Hitler and the likes of him come up, but at no point does he try to stop him. And Verge isn't even human. All the people around Jack are clueless and too stupid to stop him.Perhaps another point that makes this film feel so oppressing and bleak is that the world Jack inhabits is uncaring. Perhaps the best example of this comes in the incident number four where Jack is alone with his victim in her house and suggests that she screams for help. But no one comes to help. He joins her and screams from the top of his lungs and bangs the door as if tempting the fate or to prove his arrogant and cynical view of people to be true.It isn't because Jack is too smart that he doesn't get caught. Sure, he's got book smarts, but no master plan per se. No ultimate goal, not any that he's aware of. It's not that he's too smart for the police and the rest for them to catch him, it's that they're too indifferent and stupid to catch him. And most of all, Jack is just too lucky. There are few moments where he is just a few steps away from being caught, but then something happens that is beyond his control and he gets away with it. A perfect example is the ""great"" rain that washes away the trail of blood Jack left behind by dragging a corpse from the back of his van. Von Trier certainly portrays the world and its people in a way that allows serial killers like Jack to thrive. It's fitting that in the end Jack is caught by sheer luck and most of all, suspected only of robbery when in fact he's killed over sixty people.It's a world where bad deeds go unpunished. In the end, it's Jack's own arrogance that sends him to the deepest part of hell. During the epilogue we watch as Jack and the now present escort Verge literally descending into hell. This part relies more on visual storytelling, and the imagery presented here certainly is imaginative and intriguing. It combines visual effects to practical on location filming.It's revealed that Verge isn't in fact taking him to the deepest part of hell, but actually to some levels above even the level from where the bottom seems endless. Jack and Verge come across a bridge overlooking the abyss. The bridge has fallen and on the other side are the stairs to redemption. Jack attempts to climb across to get out, but falls to the abyss. Cue credits accompanied by the song Hit the Road Jack.I felt relieved as the credits started to roll. The House That Jack Built shows a bleak and a cynical world where serial killers like Jack are allowed to go on with their murders for over ten years. We don't see Jack facing justice in the earthly realm. He might be had been killed or just arrested. Maybe what Lars is trying to depict here that people like Jack will ultimately receive their punishment for their hubris. Their place is in the deepest parts of hell and it's their own arrogance that leads them there.How you react to The House That Jack Built might also depend how seriously you take it. When Jack is flailing a knife in front of a woman who he has tied up and complaining about how it's always the man's fault and how to be born a man is to be born guilty, alarm bells should be going off. It's an ironic scene that couldn't have been written by accident.The House That Jack built is certainly hard to watch during its most violent points. I too had to peek through my eyelashes at some points. It's also oppressive to be exposed to some truly evil thoughts throughout the film. There's very little joy to be found here, although there are some dark humour flavoured moments here and there that stem from Jack's OCD, like the scene where he's about to flee his murder scene, but he can't because he fears he may have left bloodstains behind, so he has to return to the house to clean over and over again even though he can already hear the sirens. Here we come to an important question: is a movie about a serial killer allowed to be evil and hard to watch. I say yes. I didn't leave the film hating it, but it certainly evoked feelings in me, feelings that didn't make me feel good. I could say that a film has done its job, if it manages to raise feelings in its viewer. They don't only have to be positive. It's easy to slam such films to be depraved and garbage, but I'd wager that few directors are out there just to bum people out.The House That Jack Built most of all reflects the thoughts of its maker. It certainly can be interpreted in many ways; a self-portrait of Lars himself as a failed artist who only can create films containing only death and vile and disgusting imagery. I see it as Lars' view of today's world. It certainly is a depressing one, I don't deny that. What gives it some hope however, is the fact that throughout the film Jack is on his way to hell and that it's his own hubris that finally lands him a punishment crueller than god had reserved for him.",The House That Jack Built

221,nickrissmeyer,Disjointed story with potential.,7,13 October 2019,The movie starts of seemingly like it's going to be about a serial killer with OCD and it's so well shot and interesting and then it just goes on and on in a seemingly random direction with crazy things happening and looses all the steam it had at the start. There's also many moments of weird self worship from Von Trier that feel shoe horned in and don't advance the plot very much. Regardless of all of that it's still worth the watch for the tone and cinematography alone. Also love the type design and the marketing for this film.,The House That Jack Built
222,Andrelamus,Wants to be an art film,5,7 April 2019,"This wasn't a horrible film. It wasn't a masterpiece either, but it had its good parts. I felt like Matt Dillon delivered a solid performance portraying a complicated character. Up to about incident 4 or even incident 5, the film was good. It was interesting and brutal, yet had a surprising amount of comedy in it. But by the discussion between Jack and Verge about the meaning of art came, the film turned into a borefest. A self indulgent part which contributed little to the plot and just lengthened the film unnecessarily.By the time the film reaches its climax, I was uninterested and although the violence grew more and more gruesome, its impact was weakened. What could have made it better was a good ending. Unfortunately, it wasn't. A surreal ending which felt completely out of place for this story only strengthened my distaste with direction the film was taking. It tried so hard to become art, to have some sort of meaningful commentary or special characteristic, but it failed tremendously. This could have been a nice, well made dark comedy, but it simply tried too hard to be something it's not.Overall, this is not a recommended film. It's too long, self indulgent, and by the end of it you just wish it to be over. I will say though, that it has a wonderful start which I enjoyed a lot and a great performance by the lead actor.",The House That Jack Built

225,mattbowerbank-66872,A Poor Mans American Psycho,3,2 November 2019,"Cutting to the chase, The House That Jack Built is most certainly not the ""best serial killer/psycho film ever made"", nor is it horrendous, but it pales in comparison to American Psycho, due to bizarre choices made by Lars von Trier.Lars van Trier was onto something with The House That Jack Built, attempting to critique the nature of art through the mind of a psychopath, however, Lars cannot decide whether the film should be a comedy, horror, or something else entirely, and the result is a film that sits in neither genre comfortably, resulting in a confusing journey for the viewer.The film unquestionably contains many lazy plot elements. Conveniently, it's set in rural 70's/80's USA, meaning that Jack can ineptly bluster his way into becoming a serial killer without any thought going into commiting the crimes. Early on, this seems to be very dark humour coming through, but by the mid-point of the film, it takes a dark turn, becoming senseless violence. Not that the latter is bad - Jack is a deranged serial killer after all - but it makes the film hard to follow in the point(s) it's trying to make. Are we to take Jack's words seriously, or with a grain of satirical salt? Lars von Trier doesn't make this at all clear, but what is clear is his using of the film for his own soapbox rant. The scene where he references his own films is particularly embarrassing, but is this satire, or Lars lazily, shamelessly whining at his critics? Due to the mixing of genres, it's difficult to know.Another incredibly lazy plot element is Jack's magically large inheritance, which seems to mean he doesn't have to work and has unlimited funds with which to create/destroy his house over and over again. While the concept of the house seems to work perfectly, symbolically representing a yearning within Jack, and playing on the trait of psychopaths to become bored easily, not having Jack participate in the wider world through magic money seems lazy, especially in a film that has a runtime of 270 minutes. It once more seems to be a plot element designed to allow Jack to pursue his killing spree unhindered. I do also find myself questioning whether the ""bored psychopath"" element was something Lars accidentally stumbled into rather than deliberately knowing this character trait.Something other reviewers haven't mentioned is that the character of Jack is just a shameless lift of Patrick Bateman from American Psycho.Whether Matt Dillon was deliberately trying to mimic this timeless character, or it was at Lars von Trier's direction will probably never be known, but the similarities, from the mannerisms to Jack's personal style is truly shameless.Finally, the finale of the film, as in the epilogue, is, to be brief, Lars  trying to be as artistic as possible, adding nothing of value to the film and only confusing audiences by changing the genre in the closing minutes.While this film is neither a burning wreckage nor a masterpiece, it seems to be inferior, and significantly so, when sat alongside American Psycho where the story is more consistent, compelling and entertaining. The House that Jack built has some interesting points, but they are delivered lazily, in a confused manner, and ultimately twisted up with Lars von Trier's personal ranting.",The House That Jack Built
226,ivananagyfife,Worst Ever Entertainment - and I even paid for it,5,27 April 2019,"One needs to ask what is clever or entertaining about stretching the length with the same, thousand times-seen-before clichés - these ideas of murder..

227,tnm-contact,"Pretentious non-sense (very general spoilers below, they might not be considered spoilers at all)",1,14 March 2019,"Pretentious, forced. It only works on meta level. It's trying just as hard to be special just as its title character. There are some nice stills, but those are also feel forced and very artificial. If you are looking for merit, you'll only find superficial, shallow, sweaty tries. If you're looking for easy fun and grit as a thriller style (think Saw!) you'll be majorly disappointed and bored out of your mind, with the random documentary footages, and slow scenes. There's no new art in it, just the flashing of other pieces of art and trying to measure up to them. And failing in this effort.
Also the OCD aspect is just a gimmick to fill the 30 minutes out of the 2.5 hours: the symptoms of the disorder are painted fairly precisely, but the OCD forced actions are not present before OCD first mentioned (e.g. in the first murder) and swiftly swept away after. (As Good As It Gets in comparison is consistent at least if not this accurate in exploring this mental disease.)
And that's the ultimate flaw in this movie: what mental problems does have Jack, because we see OCD, sociopathic, psychopathic and authistic behaviors and god knows what else. (I only have brief familiarity with psychology and psychiatry.)Btw, then superb intellect and verbal abilities of Jack are not present in the movie. Although, since the and of the movie and with it the complete narration, is open to interpretation -- a very cheap tool nicely fitting among the other cheap tools throughout the movie --, it might be that these are just Jack's egoistic thoughts about himself.)You will only loose a short sigh (and a few minutes grunting the next day when you complain about this film), if you miss it.",The House That Jack Built

He could be more interesting than regular theologians, but in the end he still can't think about the world critically. A girls screams in the movie and what happens? Well, Karl Marx would know what's happening. Lars von Trier doesn't. He can't burst his theologian's bubble. He's not capable of that. He has to resort to silly theology because he can't imagine the end of capitalism. Trier's movies are good indicators of where we're at, no doubt about it. And if you're aware of Trier's definicies, the line he cannot cross, if you don't expect from him something really radical, you could find that his movies are standing on their heads.

Jack is journeying through hell with Virgil (a role also played perfectly by Ganz), and discussing a few of his many sadistic crimes as a serial killer with OCD in the 70's (murders which Jack sees as art). The dialogues between Virgil and Jack in hell is some of the best written for a film in a long time. Left the cinema with the hair in the neck standing up and hundreds of existential questions, and ideas of how to even begin to analyze such a raw, philosophical, deep and genius film. Perfection.

Highly recommended but about twenty minutes too long.I'm saddened to see how few good reviews the film received from critics, but I'm not surprised.

Just want to pick apart two things that I've seen in a lot of reviews here first...
1. As with most serial killer films, this is not about a guy we are supposed to sympathise with or even like. He is a grotesque person and that's why it's a great film.
2. This is not some hyper mysogynist gore fest which celebrates the murder and mistreatment of women and children. It's about a damn serial killer, whose evolution we witness. We don't get to see his origin but clearly he has issues as he is, again, a serial killer. When did people start taking issue with these films?Just sit back and enjoy this journey of a serial killer, a mental narcissist, a psychopath, as he goes from being a weak obsessive compulsive killer to one who takes risk after risk once he decides not to hide who he is anymore.It's a fantastic exploration into just how dark and selfish people can be, if you're paying attention. It's great to take a dip into a film which is just confident in its belief that people are just awful.It's refreshing to see underdeveloped, imperfect characters. I've seen people complain about how 2 dimensional some of the female characters are, which is ignorant of the fact that these kinds of people absolutely exist in reality, and that this character doesn't seem to target people who might have the spirit to fight back. Serial killers are predators, not idiots.
Plus it even gets mentioned in the film, maybe those critics who walked out of the initial showing shouldn't have been allowed to review a film they didn't even sit through.It's a simple message, people aren't perfect, and some are less perfect than others.",The House That Jack Built

This is the fourth movie since then and it is the worst. The previous three, at least, have some redeeming qualities, and, despite being trash in essence, they are more or less engaging. But this piece of art reminded me of the work of film student with zero talent but with enormous ego. All these philosophical bla-bla-bla's with no relevance to anyone make this even more unbearable.

Most people will probably not get all three layers since they don't know Triers own story or the Divine comedy. But even the top layer - the serial killer story - is among the best serial killer stories out there.
Trier is an actual artistic genius and it is refreshing to see that he still does whatever he wants to do.
The mix between funny, touching and repulsive stuff works well, and in this area Trier is only matched by David Lynch among living directors.Matt Dillon was perfect and the other actors did it very well too. Some scenes were beautiful (literally like paintings - you'll understand when you see it). Other parts of the film looked like he filmed it with a potato. That's Trier.

258,AlexBako,Stop thinking as a self-serving filmmaker Von Trier!,6,5 July 2019,"At this point Von Trier makes movies as a form of self-meditation.The first two hours derive from the directing style he used in Nymphomaniac, which is a lot of Von Trier dialogue through his characters, accompanied with visuals to explain his positions . But In this one, I found the writting to be thinner and the metaphors a bit redundant. Surprisingly this is funnier than I ever expected. Believe me, there's a lot of violence, not as extreme or graphic as some previous of his works, but it is certainly there. I suppose at this point, I wans't exactly thrilled with the overrall outcome.Then the film's final half comes banging. There is a point that Von Trier so blatantly uses to express his ""genius"" and his ""art-making"" but ends up exposing his narcissistic side once again. All that deviate the main plot. In the same time Von Trier uses this twist as a gimmick to portay himself as the lead and turn this film to a whacky but interesting sidenote. The film ends, Von Trier's point has been accounted and his self-healing is done, all with a great dose of humor. But there lays the problem for me in his latests efforts. Von Trier can't stop making movies that serve him and not his character. The characters never take life of their own. They feel inprisoned to the creator's mind square and rarely end up in a natural manner, one that's natural to the story anyhow. And that's a problem when you as a creator are so inspired from your own work, that you put clips from your previous works in your movie and declare yourself an icon. But maybe that's what makes you unique, I guess. I just wish to see a film that when the creadits roll, I couldn't tell who made it.Conclusion: It's what you would expect from Von Trier if you saw his last films. His trademark style is here. His visuals are at times fantastic. This time a lot of humor is injected too. But going forward, I want this movie to be the last that Von Trier tries to consume his characters with his ego.

I rather liked the Dantesque Inferno format to the plot's structure, as well as the focus on Jack's view that all the most evil men in mankind';s history have only been fulfilling William Blake's vision of man 'the Tiger' as opposed to 'the Lamb'. Whereas man is capable of extreme compassion, he is also capable of extreme cruelty as von Trier shows in this film.Matt Dillon puts in an excellent performance, worthy in my opinion of an Oscar nomination. Riley Keough and also Uma Thurman are also very good in their cameo roles.To me, Lars von Trier is back to his best here. This is not a film for everyone, but it is nice to see controversial films like this still being made as an antidote to the sugar-candided Hollywood pulp that is being churned out nowadays.

269,Personian,"Who Built The House You See, When After All It Was You And Me",9,21 March 2020,"As the story goes, when this film premiered at Cannes, half the audience walked out, and the other half, at the end, gave an extended standing o. When the lights came up, Matt Dillon turned to the director and said, ""That was a great movie!"" The director just gave him a shocked stare. Of course, Lars Von Trier is always going to throw people under the bus, so that's no surprise. But the real theme of this film *is* whether or not it should exist. Anyone writing articles that ask that same question apparently didn't pick up on that. Half of the running time is filled with discussions about whether or not murder is art. Whether or not love matters. Things of that nature. The director is clearly speaking through the mouth of the *other* side of the conversation -- taking sides against his own main character -- so he brings a decided conscience to the story. It's Von Trier's nature to explore the darkness. Yes, a good number of people will find ways to laugh, as cruel people enjoy laughing at cruelty, and people will find a way to ignore the cerebral aspect. That's okay. As George Carlin said, imagine the average person, and then realize that half the world is dumber than that guy. But I'm thinking that the cruelty fetishist is going to feel harried and judged by the end. But then, who knows. Salo also had its cerebral, questioning aspect -- also ignored by most viewers -- and yet to claim that it wasn't also meant to get off sadists is to not understand it either. I just don't see Von Trier as occupying the same space as Pasolini. At the same time, I can't say that this isn't exploitative. I wouldn't know. I studied it, as I would any point of conflict. It felt meditative all the way through, even when it was gut-wrenchingly suspenseful/unwatchable.",The House That Jack Built

To those who knock the film for being merely the work of a sick mind, I say no. Humans (some of us anyway) have a fascination with the fact that we have the capability to do terrible things to each other. The scenes that are tough to watch are tough to watch exactly for that reason. This stuff actually happens, and we're always given the sanitized story in news reports. Here it is in stark terms. Sometimes kids are victims. Do we *need* to see this portrayed in cinema? That's up for debate, but films such as this are there to remind us.

276,dexterbmet,This is a brilliant film but.....,7,14 March 2019,This is a great film and the acting from matt dillon was brilliant. The scene when he changes the kids facial expressions makes me shiver everytime I see it and it is a great peace of horror. The character development our main character goes though I think it's great as well from the awkward man who is obsessed with cleaning and has bad ocd holding him back to the psychotic serial killer is just brilliant. Lars van trier does not hold back from making it as uncomfortable and dirsterbing as he can with kills lasting over several minutes and certainly earns the 18 rating. However it isn't perfect. Everytime the narrator comes in it does annoy me as it brings me out of the film and reminds me it's just a peice of fiction which does take away the uncomfortable factor. And the ending when he is going though hell isn't that good either and brings me away from the realistic aspect and ruins the whole film for me. But the house that jack built out of the bodies I'd his victims is one very creepy scene and it is brilliant. Overall its a brilliant interpretation of a serial killer with some great shots and acting but is occasionally ruined by bringing me out of the film and reminding me its just a film.,The House That Jack Built

The final 15 minutes are a phenomenal departure from the rest of the film for which we've become accustomed to a certain tone (at 2 hours and 15 minutes). Matt Dillon is at his peak throughout this with amazing supporting performances, Virgil is played superbly by Bruno Ganz as he takes Jack through the afterlife.

The story of a serial killer and several key events over his 12 year reign.
Dillon being the troubled psychopath explaining his art, perhaps an exaggerated version of Lars Von Trier himself offering an explanation of his extreme perspective on life and how he expresses himself in through his movies.
However, this does not excuse the fact that the events portrayed throughout are next level disturbing, watchable and understandable but still questionable.
I enjoyed this film and watching the believable story of a serial killer developing his hunger, the hiccups he made during his beginnings and the extreme thoughts he had that kept him motivated.
I don't want to say much else, as you really should watch this movie, the ending was a little odd, but an odd movie tends to have an odd ending. I am also wondering if Lars Von Trier is under police observation, and would like to suggest that if he is not then perhaps he should be.

Discussions on the extreme, brutal violence and explicit sex - especially against women (there's a whole section in the middle of this film that addresses why women are generally the victims..) fuel the notoriety and people going to great lengths to tell you 'things that happen in this film' that simply don't. There are things that happen in the plot, but they are never visually realised.So if you're going along expecting to see children shot in the head, or a woman have her breast cut off, you'll be disappointed (!). Now, you see? Now I've mentioned those things, you're imagining them! But you won't see them *happen* in this film.Yes, the subject matter is brutal (and there are some violent scenes - Uma Thurman gets an unexpected nose job from a car jack), and yes, the aforementioned child shooting/breast removal do happen, but you won't see them.This is almost a paint by numbers LVT and comes across as a sort of 'Jack - Portrait of a Serial Killer'. It's got von Triers's shaky, intrusive camera, is quite thoughtful, incredibly tense, has dreadful dialogue, is really boring in parts, is absolutely beautifully shot, and probably quite pointless..Not sure who you'd recommend it to.

299,ethancarmanmoore,The House That Jack Built (2018) Review,9,19 September 2018,"I just saw Lars Von Trier's new film 'The House That Jack Built' at the Atlantic Film Festival. I'm not extremely familiar with Trier's other work (I love Antichrist and Dancer in the dark is one of the most depressing films I've ever seen), but I've still been looking forward to this one since its premiere at Cannes. The subject matter peaked my interest and the trailer looked great. The early reviews got me even more invested as everyone was saying it was Trier's most disturbing and violent film yet.'The House That Jack Built' was fairly brutal, yet oddly comical (if you can look past the disturbing material) and widely entertaining. I was not expecting it to be as funny as it was considering all of the 'hype' around the film's dark brutality since its screening at Cannes. Having said that there are some extremely gruesome and disturbing scenes which are effective in what they set out to do. The film is divided into 5 sections plus an epilogue. A strange structure but ultimately I think that it benefited the film as we see a slight progression of Jack's character throughout. Though it can feel a bit repetitive at points, it never gets boring and is continuously engaging. Matt Dillon was excellent as the truly psychopathic serial killer Jack. It was honestly probably the best role I've seen him in (seriously, he should be in more movies). There are many philosophical discussions about the nature of art throughout the film. This can either come off as super pretentious or can actually add to the film. I thought it worked fine in the context of the film as it relates very much to the character of Jack and how he views himself and his, so to say, 'art'The film portrays the violence in a fairly realistic manner and does not hold back. At all. Seriously, the movie is not for the faint of heart. But it never came across as gratuitous or 'edgy'. It felt like Trier was just showing us what these scenarios would look like if a serial killer viewed his killings as art. If you're a fan of Trier's work then definitely try and see this one. Even if you're just a fan of disturbing art-films, check it out. It has a screening at VIFF in October but other than that I have no idea where you can see it. Surprisingly, the Atlantic Film Festival (Halifax, Nova Scotia) had a one-night screening for the film. Either way, try and see it if it looks interesting to you.

310,Ryan-tosatto,"The Masterpiece Lars Built (or ""The Balls on This Guy"")",10,12 December 2019,"This is the reason the haters hate Lars, the admirers admire and Lars is Lars. The not so bright haters will miss the point completely and condemn this film due to its ""extreme violence"" which I honestly do not see. If Jack is nothing but sadistic glorification of violence and hatred then it missed its target audience by a few miles with everything in between the ""murders"". I don't believe this brand of criticism is worth consideration because I doubt the person actually watched the film and if they did they made up an entirely different product in their agenda heavy consciousness. The next critic will try to call Jack pompous self indulgent garbage as loud as possible, not realizing the irony of this practice. How self important must you be to denounce someone else's work of art based on your standards. The folly though is not in the analysis but in the inability to appreciate despite of. Because yes Jack is almost entirely made for the gratification of the director. It doesn't try to hide it too much. This is the basis for the parenthetical of the title that Lars has some major balls, some audacity, no f's to give. One of modern films most accused of pompous self important gratuity jumps off the top rope with a philosophical discussion with an otherworldly arbiter on the worth of a mans achievements and life choices about the meaning of art and how he has evolved as an artist, and uses an OCD serial killer critiquing his murders as the protagonist. Just In Case you hadn't gotten the inside joke. And this is why I and I assume the rest of the admirers dig Lars. He leans into every criticism of his films thematically while using the conversation between jack and the arbiter to spill his blood for the world. It's brutal honesty about his art and method and how luck and serendipity played as much a part in his success as his ego based opinion of it coming from a pure genius within him. Each murder vignette shows his progression from being meticulous OCD overly focused on perfection and perception to taking chances and fishing for detractors. All in all working towards the completion of his house, or mastering of the craft which he is constantly having to tear down and start over because the material and blueprints he was working with no longer fit his vision. The refrigerated room he takes his victims back to hide is his conscious mind where he tries to find inspiration to no avail, it's full of frozen pizza (unoriginality, unspectacular) and his completed works which only serves to promote derivative work. There is another door in the freezer that has remained unopened despite his best efforts (this is the unconscious mind or collective conscious or ether where original ideas come from.) it isn't until he focuses on making something out of the contents in the freezer that he is finally caught and put down and sent to be judged by Verge and perhaps god himself. The ideas presented in this work of art should be contemplated and discussed because without original ideas, new novel art and the brave souls who put themselves out in front of the world to be judged by those who are too afraid to try or lacking the spark inherent in all purveyors of original. Without new ideas we die on the vine. So with this I implore you to watch this film again with new eyes and open minds to continue the discussion he and Verge band to us.And for no other reason than the final scenes of Jacks journey rheogh the afterlife this film is a masterpiece. If you hate the first hour and 45 minutes it's all worth it for the last 15.",The House That Jack Built
311,DarkSpotOn,The Ending,5,6 July 2021,"This film was decent. Most of the film was solid. The story was okay, we learn about Jack and his obsession of killing innocent people, mainly targeting women. It tries to compare Adolf Hitler's viewpoints that murder and suffering is art, that's what's Jacks ideology seems to be as-well.Now there are a lot of problems with this film:
The film did not need to be as long as it was. It could of been much shorter, and it would of been probably better. Not needed scenes, are taking too much from this movie.The music used in this is ridiculous. Some happy music keeps playing, and it pissed me off rapidly. I was expecting some piano, sad music. No they use some funky music and it takes you out from this film rapidly! That was ridiculous and i hated that so much. When the music of transitions started to play out, i just got dragged out from the story, and made me just pretty upset on how senseless the music choose for this was.The ending was the worst part. When Jack stumble ""hell"", that was just so unnecessary, and just was there to circle the film. The hell scenes were just so needless, it's like another film started to play. I personally hated the ending, because from a kinda-realistic film, it transformed into guessing of existence of hell, which was just childish to me. See, out of all endings you pick that he ends up in ""hell""? Ridiculous.The characters except Jack are very flat. They dont have any backstory, anything to care about the people he is killing. Obviously i cared about the kids being killed, but again none of these characters had any development, to give us any reason to care about their deaths. The only character which gets any depth is our villain, Jack. Which is to-me sad. To think that none of the ""neutral"" ""heroic"" characters could of gotten any kind of backstory, it is really sad and takes you out from the film.Ultimately the quality of this film as in it 's picture quality is solid, the acting was decent and i give this film 5 out of 10, because the story was decent, but the development could of been better. This film could of been much better to be honest.",The House That Jack Built

315,petroskaplanidis,This is one more 10/10 Lars.gem.,10,12 October 2018,"This is one more 10/10 Lars.gem. A deep descent to the psyche of the psychopath, a horror story that makes all the rest look like Disneyland. You unconsciously control your breath and wait for the next shocking image or word. In this story, Bruno 'call me Verge' as Charon shepherds dead Jack through the sewers on the verge of Acheron. On this long journey, serial killer Jack tells Charon about his murders and so we watch. Charon is not impressed, the roar of those millions who suffered and was annihilated by mass murderer leaders, sounds in the Hades underworld and diminish the hubris of this insignificant psychopath. He was an engineer but incapable to design and build his own silly tiny house. He could not select the right material because not any of the ordinary was proper for him. But psychopath Jack is proud for his murders, he succeeded because he was good to this only, the indifference of the rest was his ally, no one paid any attention when he carried the bodies and nobody heard the screams of the suffering. This was the world where Jack lived and unfortunately this is ours. Just one Uma was enough to trigger his psychopathetic passion to cause pain. He was now away from his miserable childhood, when hidden in the tall grass was amazed by the reapers cutting it down. So he started with naive women and ended with men that could manipulate, a common choice for all those fortunately less dangerous everyday psychopaths who live among us. Finally Jack's luck ended and Charon was his last companion. But even in that hell, his arrogance led him believe there is a way out, that he is invincible, because back then he had the right and power to take the lives of the week and the innocent no matter what his motive was.",The House That Jack Built

319,dmanchon,The House That Lars Built,9,30 November 2018,"This is not a film that everyone will like or understand. The extreme amount of physical violence and cruelty, and the unconventional storytelling vehicle (a conversation between two people over five episodes in the life of a serial killer) are a huge wall against which most of the public will crash into. But, if the spectator manages to embrace it, the movie its really unique and powerful experience.1. I really liked how the story is told. Five separate episodes explained during a conversation between a killer and a classic ancient roman poet. The extreme violence of the captured episodes contrast with the calm conversation tone and the highbrow nature of it, without being too pretentious (just a little).2. The victims of the killer shown a high detachment and a very passive attitude, far from trying to portrait a realistic vision of those horrible crimes, later the director reassure himself by citing 'The lamb' poem of William Blake. I appreciate that approach since otherwise the kind of cruelty shown by the killer will be totally unbearable to watch, and helps to focus on the character and not on the actions.3. Love the editing of the movie and how the director intertwine recollections of the killer with stock material during the conversation excerpts, i found it very entertaining and pleasant to watch.4. I admire the epilogue, i found it brave and i liked the style choices, but, it is something that probably will put some people out of the movie.5. Without trying to analyze much the message of the movie, i enjoy the extreme experience, visually its stunning, the acting is amazing, the storytelling really engaging, editing is great, good use of the music, probably length can shortened a bit.Epilogue: Overall is a movie that sticks with you some time after watch it, and that is basically what i expect in a great movie.

the movie was overall fine. it wouldnt have been memorable if it hadnt made me sick and it wouldnt be my first reccomendation for a mind-freak movie bc it wasnt even the sort of movie to leave me guessing. it was a movie easily taken at face-value and nothing more.

While watching this I felt like the plot was going no where, being a very long movie it felt like it was never going to end. It was extremely boring and at times even hard to sit through. The repetitiveness did not help with the dread of having to sit through the rest of the film. Telling the tale of a deeply disturbed man with OCD in theory sounds like it should make a very interesting or at least somewhat enjoyable film. It just wasn't done correctly, I feel the directing style made it seem more like a reality TV show with gruesome murder sprinkled in. It wasn't even so bad that it's good it was just truly awful. The only part of movie I enjoyed was the cutaway to an animation of a man walking under street lamps where Jack explains his killing cycle, even that part was long and drawn out. There was no suspense and the murders all just felt senseless. I feel like a lot could of been done with the concept of this film but overall it just was not worth watching and I regret seeing it.",The House That Jack Built

And when you think it can't anymore it continues to drag on. I get what Von Trier was trying to do but by the midway point I was begging for it to just be over. I really don't know how he made such graphic violence and disturbing material so incredibly boring. I also absolutely hated the way the movie was shot with constant shaky cam and random zooming and cutting in and out. Even though the colors were nice it felt like watching a student film.The lead actor was great as Jack and some of the scenes are genuinely very creepy.

324,batmanbatka,"If you could consider the word-salad an ""Art-movie""",1,15 December 2018,"Obviously Lars von Trier is NOT my type of director. I didn't like ""Melancholia"" either. LvT's prefered ""story-telling"" tool is the pseudo-intellectual use of symbolism.
In ""The house that Jack Built"" he over-used the so called word-salad: throwing out notions as OCD, Narcissism, trauma etc, plus some random art references hoping that it will impress the viewer's perceptions and it will lead them to their own conclusions and interpretation. lying to them that somewhere there in this mess of a movie there would be some ""deep meaning"". LOL. IMHO it's an insult to the viewer's intellect. The prevailing IMDB's rating 10/10 makes me believe such an insult might be well deserved.
Considering the cinematography, I agree with some of the comments that the ""shaking camera makes the viewer dizzy"". Awful approach!
Definitely unnecessary level of animal&human cruelty. Even for a psychopath movie... Do they still buy this stuff??? Is this STILL trendy?

a boring, unnecessarily long and repetitive portrayal of human psyche.
he spends 150 minutes on such portrait yet he gets so lost in making sure we are shocked that he fails to give the viewer a clear picture of the psychopath's motivations or there lack of. he tries to hide his clear lack of knowledge on the subject matter with bold and crude symbolism which has led his creation to lose subtlety required for an art to be something other than an statement.
unfortunately his movies are becoming more of a reaction towards the audience's acceptance( or lack of) rather than any stand alone project. you can no longer watch any of his movies without noticing this is his anger projected into the story. he is pissed and he has completely let go of his ego to drag him whenever it wants.",The House That Jack Built

It feels like how a teenager who just read a Wikipedia page about serial killers would view serial killers while making some oddly forced juxtaposition to art. It's glossed-over, talky and not very believable. The normally seemingly artistically sincere von Trier seems to think endlessly showing us art along with discussion of art makes his film artistic. He even goes as far as referencing some his past films, in this film. Really? Other than some of the worst film editing I have ever witnessed, it's shot well. The final act would have been really cool as it's own film about eternal judgement, but overall this movie is very disappointing.

I stumbled upon it On Demand and I'm glad I did. Matt Dillon's performance is convincing and striking. Jack is obviously a composite of multiple real life serial killers, (Denis Raider comes to mind). But Dillon does a good job at harnessing the visceral killing madness of many serials into a singular functional figure. Jack doesn't live like a monster or stand out as one. He's a monster in plain sight. Surprisingly, the deviance that's usually associated with real life serial crimes is missing from the film. Perhaps it is missing because it would otherwise overwhelm the audiences with too much disturbing imagery . The pure evil intent behind the crimes however is inescapable. Dillon makes creepy and dark seem common place. To be honest the more scary part of the film is Jack's fire engine red clownish van which is a character unto itself. Many professional critics have described the films as boring and slow but it's actually an interesting horror piece of work. Give it a sick, guilty pleasure chance.",The House That Jack Built

This becomes more and more gross for each scene you watch. I had to go after the fourth scene because it was to disturbing to watch.The way Lars von Trier tells the story is boring and the only way he can get people to go to the Theater is with slaughter and violence.In the movie he compares violence with art and classic music and normalize Jacks behavious duo to the fact that he has mental problems (ODC and insane cleaning problems).

The acting by everyone involved is top-notch, the writing and direction is absolutely fantastic, as well. This movie can be surprisingly funny, from time to time.

Matt Dillon does a great job, very real as a serial murderer and his descend into madness combined with the hints of Dante's Divine Comedy make this a truly masterpiece.

345,blankjons,I loved this film.,9,17 May 2019,"I recently watched this film, and I could not stop thinking/ talking about it afterward. I've heard that many viewers felt that the film was overly self-absorbed and pretentious, in that it exploits violence and depravity for the sake of providing shock value. I'll agree that certain scenes were hard to stomach, but I find this quality of the film to be its most entertaining and realistic appeal. I loved this movie, because I felt that it very deeply portrayed the intensity of serial murderers that exhibit profoundly intrinsic narcissism, nonexistent empathy, and absolutely no ability to understand or identify with remorse or human pain. In this way, the sadistic violence in this film does not apologize for or make justification itself, because it would be contrived. One of my favorite novels is ""120 Days of Sodom"" by Marquis de Sade. This book is exponentially more disturbing and hellishly violent than this film, but its sadistic qualities hold true in the same way. The plot is essentially centered upon 4 rich men who are so bored with their affluent life that they decide to brutally and unmercifully torture a large group of kidnapped teenagers in unspeakable ways. For these men, there hedonistic pleasure and sexually deprived desires are all that matter. I find this to be interesting in a philosophical sense, as the novel seeks to completely undo the boundaries between good and evil. I know I've gone off topic a bit, but I wanted to show that this film is great for the same exact reason; Jack is a man who defines his life purpose with his hedonistic narcissism and inability to experience empathy. Vice and virtue are purely subjective in his mind, and I find that it is difficult to argue with this view. Nietzsche discusses a similar idea as Jack in the scene in which he explains his notion of lion and lamb mentality. He basically states that some people are born as lions and others are born lambs. His implication is that there is nothing wrong with being either one, we all just have to be who were born to be and accept that nature is designed this way. I feel that he is making the claim that morality is completely manmade, and therefore, it is always subjective and self-defined. Nietzsche's concept is essentially the same, in that he defines people as possessing either ""master"" or ""slave"" mentality; we cant make excuses about being or the other, but rather the importance in life is making the most with whoever you believe yourself to be. This is mainly what I love about Jack's character; he is totally unapologetic for his actions and has a sort of complete acceptance for his role in life.This movie is designed for the philosophy lovers, and I really enjoyed it because of that. This movie made me think deeply about the concepts of subject vs. objective morality, and I felt that this was sort of its purpose. As I said, the violent scenes are pretty sadistic and hard to watch at certain points, but I find that the disturbing qualities of these scenes make it worth watching. If you enjoy being pushed to your limits of depravity and philosophical though, then you will most likely enjoy this film.",The House That Jack Built

He has very inconsistent OCD and the explanation that the film gives for it would be fine if his personality didn't completely change as well. With such emphasis on his OCD in the first two killings we see, it is such an abrupt change between the next that makes me think they forgot and had to add in an explanation later.All of the kills look ridiculous, especially the second. Am I supposed to be laughing? Am I supposed to be anxious? Scared? This film does a terrible job communicating with the audience with what emotions we're supposed to be feeling. The special effects themselves are actually quite good though, but the cgi is painfully bad.This film is beyond pretentious with its drawn out scenes of animal/wildlife stock footage, piano stock footage, and ESPECIALLY the final scene. The man he has been talking to is actually some guy who guides people to heaven or hell. Why? What purpose does this serve other than to have a gotcha moment with the audience? Fans of ""I'm a Nazi"" Lars von Trier will probably love this movie for no reason other than it was directed by him. (If you have genuine criticisms of his movies they will just say you don't understand it.)If you're a fan of his works, go wild, if not don't watch this movie.

356,EvaJK94,"Do people actually enjoy this type of illogical, gory and meaningless stuff?",2,23 October 2018,"To be fair this type of movies in not my style and it's the first Lars von Trier movie I've seen but I consider myself openminded and always watch different stuff. Positives: There's some good humor and some funny moments at times. Matt Dillon is excellent as a serial killer.Now let's talk about the real negatives.
Constant shaking camera made me dizzy.Lack of a decent storytelling and character background. Who is Jack? Why is he like that? What triggered his first killing? I'm sure he met annoying people before. Where does he live and where does he kill? Why is there no one close around him noticing his behavior? Writting a story about a serial killer (which is already such a cliche) with no real background or other people perspectives and showing only the killings and nothing else. Anyone could do that I consider that easy, sloppy writting.No logic in the story. No victim ever reacts at any way even though they could. They are portrayed ridiculously stupid and easy to kill. His murders are so sloppy and blatant that the fact that no one ever suspects anything or he never get's into trouble is beyond furstrating. I can see that he is the one narrating the story so he could be narrating what he wants but I don't think that's what the writter intended.No meaning at the end which is borderline laughable. It's like the director tried to give such a deep meaning to all this that no one could see it. Seriously the endind was quite ridiculous and didn't make any sense.In conclusion, you watch a movie for the art and for the entertainment. Art? Do people seriously consider this art? Provoking with pure disturbing gory stuff? Throwing in some generic philosophical speeches and metaphors that most in the end don't really make sense makes something artistic? On the other hand when it comes to entertainment I know that that's up to personal preference. To me that's not entertainment (hence the 2/10). I honestly don't get how someone wakes up and says I'm gonna make a movie like this just for the sake of provoking, pretending there is a deeper meaning when there's absolutely none just to present myself as highly artistic and groundbreaking.",The House That Jack Built
357,jovan-soskic,Zero.,1,9 January 2019,I am sorry that there is no possibility to give a ZERO rating. Lost two and a half hours of life. Worst. Movie. Ever.,The House That Jack Built
358,pessimisticoptimist-843-265893,Hello all you happy people,7,11 January 2019,"I'll preface by saying that I'll never be able to hear 'Fame' again without picturing Edgar's wife from Men In Black being drug down the road face down behind a van. So thank you Lars for that. I think he has a penchant for Bowie. If I recall correctly the closing credits of Dogville were set to 'Young Americans.'
Lars von Trier's latest outing definately lived up to the hype it was generating. This was a truly disturbing movie. There are not too many visuals that have plucked a raw nerve in me like seeing that boy's contorted face in the freezer did. Lars Von Trier has always been a provocateur valuing shock alongside philosophy. I've heard several analysis of this movie and one that I think makes a lot of compelling points is that the film is somewhat autobiographical. Almost as if Von Trier is speaking through Jack making an arguement for the value of his life's work.
I watched this movie in succession with the Fritz Lang classic 'M' and I thought that was a very interesting Juxtaposition seeing two very different types of madmen portrayed. The killer Hans Beckert in 'M' is horrified at his latent tendencies but acts compulsarily. He loathes the hand that has been dealt him in life but sees no way out. He is, dare I say, a somewhat sympathetic character. I also thought of Alex from 'A Clockwork Orange.' He takes immense pleasure in what he does and relishes his violent outbursts. He waits for his next chance to partake in depravity almost like a teenager waits for the weekend to cut loose. Whereas Beckert from 'M' partakes in depravity almost as a salve/medicine to ease his suffering. I think Jack is somewhere in between them. In the scenes where Jack commits his crimes he doesnt seem to be enjoying himself or apalled by himself but almost as if he is doing an obligatory task. He feels like his 'art' is the only way he can reach the world and that the world would be lesser without it. I think Lars probably feels similar. Arrogant? Yes, but isn't that what film is? Seeing the world through the eyes of different people. I've seen most of his filmography and found all of them very compelling/interesting although not always agreeable. A big difference between Lars and a lot of other film makers is that Lars takes these subjects, feelings or ideas that we as a public are fascinated with and realizes them so fully and so viscerally that we recoil not only from what we are seeing but from ourselves for being engaged. 'The House that Jack Built' is the kind of movie that will make the true crime buff not as excited to watch that serial killer documentary on the history channel. At least until the experience wears off and we can slip back into sipping our cans of 'Depravity-Lite' again. I think that's kind of powerful. The only other movie that I can think of off them top of my head that had that effect on me was Michael Haneke's 'Funny Games.'
But the film definately raises the question on the fundemental elements that must be in place to facilitate art. Is there anyone who would say that Poe's 'The Raven' is not an important entry to culture? There is no love in it. Only despair and torment. I think art for me is creative observations of facets of humanity as a whole. Even the parts we don't like to think about.",The House That Jack Built

It's cold, dark, and unapologetic for being what it is...smut.When it comes to films that show harm to kids or animals, I tap out, but maybe that's the point. We have become so desensitized to violence against humans in movies, music, and television that we disregard the violence we see or hear, but when it involves kids and animals, many of us are outraged and sickened, but the only difference is animals and children are often viewed as innocent and sacred (which, obviously, got under my skin).The over-arching theme of this film seems to be a man's look at his own work and what makes the difference between art and smut.

381,jana-42543,Surprised by how much I liked this movie.,8,13 April 2020,"Given that I thoroughly enjoy violent and disturbing content, I am familiar with Lars von Trier's movies. Like other ""controversial"" directors, his movies are an acquired taste and many are in the ""love it or hate it"" category. I enjoyed some, I didn't like some, but I overall understand their appeal and I will definitely give von Trier his unique ideas, which are always very intriguing. Every one of his movies are definitely something you haven't seen before.
I was both excited and skeptical when I heard about ""The House that Jack Built""; in my opinion, serial killer movies are either very entertaining or horribly pretentious, and become boring or ridiculous after thrity minutes. I must admit it was the fact that it was a von Trier movie that made me want to check it out (so in my book, he has already succeeded as a filmmaker).Now the main thing that made me like this movie was the lead performance(s). Movies such as this rise or fall with the main character and whether you want to watch them for two and a half hours. Matt Dillon was really great as the wannabe-genius (I actually laughed at ""Mr. Sophisitcation""), at times uncomfortably socially awkward and hilariously non-charming psychopath with neurotic tendencies. Watching him fail as the smooth, rationally thinking killer he wants to be is what makes the dry dialogues between him and his victims highly entertaining. Bruno Ganz (may he rest in peace, er war einer der Großen!) as Verge was also great, I very much enjoyed this type of ""confession"" storytelling in Nymphomaniac. Also Verge telling Jack how his ideals are idiotic adds to the irony in Jack's character (and the movie's very weird sense of humour).Another thing that made me thoroughly enjoy this movie was the episodic storytelling, which surprised me, as I usually hate this type of plot generation (Only Tarantino does it well imho). But given that Jack is a very unpredictable and ruthless murderer, you never knew what he would do next, which was crucial for the viewer (or me at least) to stay interested in the film, which is very long. Call me macabre, but I would have watched 4 or 5 more ""incidents""; knowing that Jack would stop at nothing and even murder children really kept me very invested in the story until the very end.The ""artsy"" transitions and the dialogue with Verge add the whole metaphoric frame to the character and his deeds. I liked these intermissions, they made the rest of the story less bland and brutal (and the murders a tad more pointless, if you know what I mean). At times it was a little less clever and unsubtle as it probably wanted to be (which really annoyed me in Aronofsky's ""Mother!""). It was fairly obvious that some of the little scenes and pieces of dialogue were intended to offend. But honestly, I apreciated this ""lack of apology"" of the artist (or should I say, director). A bit on the nose, yes. But ironic and entertaining nontheless. Remember how Jack tries to justify some of his murders because he was ""provoked"" (the first woman was reaaally pushing it)? Even Verge remarks how all the women in Jack's tales are so stupid. I for my part thought that was morbidly hilarious.I must say, I didn't expect the direction the film took with the epilogue and I can see why people didn't like that last part. But I think it absolutely fits with all that Jack was (or thought he was). He goes to hell, but not a classic depiction from a religion, but a piece of art (Dante's ""Divine Comedy""). He tries to justify his deeds along the way, he gets judged for it and eventually he falls to his doom. Maybe an outcome we wish upon all those who commit pointless, gruesome murders?All in all, I really liked this movie. It has actually become my favourite Lars von Trier movie. I think you should not read too much into the metaphoric bits or see the film in its entriety as a ""self-portrayal"" of the director, Actually, that would probably take a part of the entertainment value away from it. I would recommend watching ""The House that Jack Built"" als a morbid little character study of a quite unique psychopath. Do what thou wilt with the commentary on art, faith, family, philosophy and anthropology.It offers a lot, answers almost nothing and it lingers uncomfortably in the mind. To me, a successful movie!",The House That Jack Built

Katabasis is defined as the underworld, throughout the entire film, he is being guided by Virg(il) - if you're familiar with Dante.

383,Impatotec,Lars von Trier's autobiography and a narcissistic statement about art...,8,14 December 2018,"As a long time von Trier fan, I believe it's pretty obvious he made this film primarily for himself, and secondly for the dogmatic fans of his own work. Sure, on the surface it is a sort of a black psychological (divine, *wink, wink*) comedy, as some of his previous films can, as well, be seen. However, there is a layer beyond the physical, even more so the psychological aspect of what is portrayed.I'll assume anyone reading this has already seen the film so I'm putting spoilers on.It is my firm belief that the entire film is a metaphor for stages of life of an artist or at least a creator in some sense. As good and realistic, if you will, as the portrayal of the mental states Jack is in, what is beyond his actions is the most fascinating part.
Jack often refers to his work as art, and incidentally, the ""incidents"" represent the stages of an artists creative mentality, the way von Trier saw and perhaps experienced. It starts with, in the context of the chapters in the film:
1.Impulsive creation, art in the moment, that one breath of inspiration that sets an artist on his path.
2. Seeking perfection, obsessing over every possible detail, trying to achieve the ultimate form of art.
3. Transgressive and controversial art, imagery designed to shock the audiences, that I believe also self-referential.
4. Love and hate of one's own work, reaching a climax of creativity, at the point of giving up and exposing ones self.
5. Burning out, making art just to get a new high, experimenting just for the sake of it and finding no new joy in this process.Throughout the film, at one point, we get a flash of most of von Triers past work, ranging from The element of crime (1984), towards Nymphomaniac (2013), which I believe closes up his ode to himself and his life's work, showing that narcissistic side again, with a possible message of the end of his artistic endeavors, but also pride in himself as an artist and his career -and possibly a large ""f you"" to the Cannes Film Festival, represented by the house he finally manages to build, with the ""body"" of his work, while also being a word play on the nursery rhyme.
The epilogue is a very comical, almost cartoonish parody of the Divine Comedy, in which Jack (von Trier) is Dante, in which he shows emotion for the first time in a Citizen-Kane-like moment, but instead of his happy ending he falls into the deepest part of hell, possibly referring to von Trier's own mental state.",The House That Jack Built

386,SketoAxtyphto,A journey inside a psychopath's artist mind.,8,25 April 2021,"To start of, I'm not a big fan of Von Trier, this movie however was something quite special. We follow the story of Jack, a wannabe architect (artist, creator) who ends up being an engineer and also a psychopath. First of all, I want to clear out that I believe that nothing in this movie happens in real life, it's just a depiction of tha main character's thoughts. Starting of with the freezer, it depicts the consciousness of Jack and a place where he keeps his memories ,the door that's locked, the subconsciousness. Throughout the movie we see Jack trying to build a house for himself but the materials are never correct, the house is a metaphor for love, affection and shelter that a psychopath needs and also a tribute to the time when he was a child at the farm being happy. The farm is the only place where I believe Jack had everything he wanted and also a clear mind, unlike the rest of the movie. The crimes that the character commited seem to have a climax approach, from being extremely careful with what he's doing to really not care at all if he's gonna be found or not. Trier presents that carefulness.on the screen as OCD, however, thinking about it, if it were for a human to commit something like that he would totally overthink the situation and after all the killings he would simply stop caring about being clean (inside his brain of course). Jack literally confesses to a policeman about his crimes and number of victims, but it's impossible for him to get caught because he is creating this reality and that's a point that I began to realize that he is not all so crazy after all, just very very sick. Towards the end, we see that Jack did not manage to built a home and that his time has come. He unlocks his subconsciousness and meets Verge, his guide through hell, who also helps him create a home using his so called, thoughout the movie, art. While journeying through hell, he gets a glimpse of his childhood memories, he realises what he has done.and wants to repent. In the final scene, Jack tries to reach heaven by climbing the walls of hell but he is not able to make it past because of his corrupted mind and thoughts.",The House That Jack Built

I was tempted to stop watching it at some spots, but I stuck through it to finish what I have started. What did I get out of that? I just was left with the feeling that the allegory for Inferno, and all the talk of art from Jack was just another way to shuffle some women-killing gore onto the screen. Needless to say that I was uncomfortable throughout the movie, but not in the way a horror movie is supposed to leave you. I say that a horror movie should leave you in a comfortable state of unease, but this movie just made me feel wrong for watching it. Virgil brings up the fact that only women are being murdered, and states that Jack has some sort of superiority complex over women. It makes me feel as if this is coming from the heart of the director, especially when imagery from the Nazis are brought up, and lets not forget about what Lars Von Trier had to say about them.Overall while I think that the actors did a fantastic job in their roles, and that the surrealism aspect that lines up with Dante's Inferno seemed to appeal to me. the whole lot of the movie just seemed to poor of taste for me. While I expect some other film fanatics to explain to me that I simply did not understand the film, what is there to understand? It simply felt like a way for a morally awful character to try and justify his actions in a span of 2 hours. I felt obligated to feel sympathy for this serial killer, but that simply wasn't gonna happen.If you're looking for a good thing to make you feel awful, and to watch some nasty killings, go ahead and watch!

The shock value of the few intense moments quickly fades because of this extremely poor pacing. Even the five real-movie scenes are pretty weak. There's no real story or lead up to how Jack met the last three victims and given his demeanor it seems highly unlikely he would establish the relationships that got him into the position to execute those kills.I'm not sure if you can even call this a movie because there is no coherent plot line, no story that develops, and essentially no real ending. This is absolutely not the 'look into the mind of a serial killer' type of movie that it's hyped up to be. There is nothing to learn from this, there are no takeaways, and it's a true waste of time.

It portrays the most despicable acts imaginable and the assumed religious aftermaths. Matt Dillons portrayal of a non repentant serial killer is so dark and disturbing that I at times felt sick to my stomach, regardless of von Triers attempts to relieve the darkest parts through distracting music and cuts.

I liked this movie because - YES our comfort our houses our civilization were built on graves and on millions of murdered bodies, on blood and biggest historical events are stories of violence.3. I liked this movie because - YES I think life is ruthless and brutal and we do not have security guarantees, only illusion of it.4. TRUE is that we are deaf and blind toward millions of cases of violence every day every second around us. thus it is pathetic and Hypocrisy when you run from cinema hall during this movie -from 40 persons watching movie 8 went out(i counted).5. there are people who don't know what is difference between tiger and lion and of course they won't understand, and dose not recognize PREDATOR nature in us, in our culture and in our history6. in Dante Alighieri's divine comedy I always was fascinated by word COMEDY. and this movie is also comedy, black as hell pit and dark as brightest lights negative (photography negative).7. if you need PROOF that this movie is great just count to articles and explanations and discussions about this movie, and/or - just try and name a movie from 2018 Which leads not only to emotionally but also mental/ intellectual fluctuations.8. you must be wise enough to play with metaphors and people who leave movie theater during watching this movie - i think they are bad players with metaphors ... for example main character is engineer dreaming to be architecture and hi is serial killer building a house.9. main character have OCD (Obsessive-compulsive disorder) sometimes i feel the kind of discomfort toward the most well-organized and perfectionist people... this discomfort is on biology/deep unconscious level for additional fun - Read how horoscope (HORRORscope) characterize virgins.10. universe need balance/harmony - thus if there is Disney Corporation - there must be (and there is) Lars Von Trier's House That Jack Built.

Your taxes, wisdom teeth surgery, listening to Paris Hilton's music, and being crucified.In other words, this is a waste of timeif time and life.

417,drucom,"Pseudo-art, and the death throes of von Trier",5,18 December 2018,"The amount of 10/10 reviews are absolutely ridiculous. Pay them no heed. 1/10 is also similarly ridiculous, as there are positive take-aways (I enjoyed Dillon's neuroticism, and the first quarter of the film is genuinely funny). However, it ends up being nothing more than a competently produced film with almost no substance, an 'anthology' with no clear direction, and an overarching 'theme' ending up as an afterthought more than anything else.'Shocked audiences at Cannes'...yes, cheap shocks. What could have been, in concept, a wonderful blend of comedy and horror falls flat, with the identity of the film never fully fledging itself out. Is it a dark comedy? One could argue this with the start. Is it von Trier lashing out at accusations of misogyny and pretentiousness by doubling down on both? There's plenty of proof for this argument as well. Is it an exploration into the nature of evil and psychopathy, and what constitutes art and artistic expression? It could have been, but it's never explored deeper than the usual tropes.I think what upsets me the most about this film is how asinine it is, BECAUSE of the 'shocking' nature of it. It approaches self-parody at times, with brutality being used for no other purpose other than to make audiences cringe. If the elements serve no purpose other than shock, what is redeeming about it?'The House That Jack Built' as a dark comedy - this would have worked fantastically, as there are legitimately funny (darkly funny, but funny nonetheless) moments in this film; the rising frustration at a broken car jack, the interchange between him and the woman behind the locked screen door, the blundering act with the police officer, the creation of the waving child before his body fully froze. The issue is that the film never fully embraces this (think American Psycho, where the film adaptation of the book softens the brutality and opts for dark, absurd comedy throughout).'The House That Jack Built' as a personal commentary of von Trier - there is also evidence of this, and in spades. The narration throughout between Jack and 'Verge' (Virgil? Hell's guide?) approaches breaking the 4th wall, between commentary of the film and commentary on von Trier's own body of work as a whole. The self-masturbation was palpable, but it is is fully confirmed near the end, when he uses footage from his own films as supporting evidence. However, this wasn't fully embraced either because the accusations against him of being a pretentious misonynyst, instead of deflecting from them, or justifying them via the commentary itself, are merely confirmed throughout the film; brutal violence is only employed against women, with very graphic shots of strangulation, bludgeoning, and even slicing off a woman's breasts) and Verge even points this out in the film. Men are killed, sure, but never sadistically. The final trap of killing 5 men with a single bullet feels merciful more than anything. Was von Trier purposefully doubling down on accusations of misogyny by ramping up the misogyny? What meta-commentary is he trying to do here? This is a cheap self-analysis of his own work, a blatant lack of self-awareness.'The House That Jack Built' as an exploration into the nature of evil, psychopathy, and artistic expression - throughout the whole film, Jack again and again mentions that he is an artist - in a literal sense, being an engineer-turned-architect, wanting to design and built his perfect edifice - which he demolishes and rebuilds over and over again; but also in an attempt to blur the line between artistry and psychopathy/evil, by making art out of his murders - comically posed photographs of his victims, presentations of his hunting which include culled crows, along with his family - even this idea is only half-baked, as only some of his murders fall into this. The most pervasive thought I had was that Jack was a pseudo-intellectual narcissist who overestimated his own intelligence, proved by his own failures as an architect, his basic views of art, and I thought whether this was in itself some kind of meta-commentary von Trier was making of himself, ironically - does he view himself as Jack thinks he does, or as Jack actually is? The reviews that state that Jack is a 'genius' are baffling - the movie makes it clear that luck, or divine providence, are instrumental in Jack's success - there are blunders and lack of preparation, in almost every instance. He even voices his lack of repercussion for anything he's ever done, which is why these interpretations of him as a 'genius killer' are baffling to me. The creation of the house from the corpses was almost so obvious, I was hoping it wouldn't actually happen - but it does, to my dismay. And at this point, the shocks are non-existent. The parallels between personal evil and the 'great evils' (Hitler, Idi Amin, Mussolini, genocide, etc) are so fundamentally basic that it must be a piss-take by von Trier.Which leads me to the following: Is von Trier so self-aware that he would make a film as a parody-commentary of his own body of work and his approach to film-making? Or is he so self-absorbed that he doesn't see that it's become a parody of himself, and he can produce half-baked films to (as evidenced by the user reviews here) riotous reception and being lauded a 'cinema genius'? I don't know, and I don't care to spend more time pondering this question, because I don't believe he is the genius that the cult of personality around him would paint him as. I believe he has produced genuinely beautiful (if haunting) films, with 'Dancer in the Dark' and 'Dogville', but the reliance of shock as a means to push films has gone full circle into self-parody now, and being self-aware of this as he may be, doesn't justify the pseudo-artistry of it.",The House That Jack Built
418,noidrove,Painful to sit through,1,13 July 2020,I don't normally leave reviews but this was so painful to sit through I felt compelled. I watched this because my friend gave it a great review saying how disturbing it was. Disturbing? Hardly. I can turn on any crime show on TV and find way more disturbing content. The film seem to hinge on pseudo art and pseudo intellect to make some kind of point. Other reviewer's have hit the nail on the head by calling it pretentious. But what upsets me the most is this is hardly a dive into a killer's subconscious. I love studying serial killers. This isn't even close. This is what Hollywood thinks of serial killers.

427,zacharyluke-61368,Dark morbid experince,9,21 November 2018,"Being a fan of Lara Von Trier and I have to say I did really like The House That Jack Built, and it has been warned this film isn't for everyone! Not just because of it's violence which yes is genuinely disturbing but because it's, well a Lars Von Trier film. Meaning, the way it's done, the structure, the storytelling, may be interesting to you or you'll get very bored. Luckily, I didn't and I have sat through all his films but this one is closest to Nymphomaniac which also had scenes that dragged. pretentious dialogue, you just got to expect it. The story is told perfectly, Jack is a sick man and we do not route for him, we are watching him on his twisted journey and listening to his thoughts, feelings, opinions, it's creepy and the movie does well at taking you there. There are moments that go over a certain line, and not just a little, they run with it to the point that line is no longer visible. Many people who don't like this film, I understand why. If you are expecting a full on fun serial killer horror, you'll be disappointed. This is a lot more, well deeper than that kind of thing. It's actually a powerful film, and yes it is funny, it needs to be! I liked it, and it's a film about many things. We've all seen brutal killings in movies right?? However, this is a Von Trier movie, so you can trust it's done in way that we've not seen before even if we have. It's unpleasant, highly disturbing, intellectual and somewhat moving. I can see many people being disappointed with this if they are expecting a normal horror film! This has a certain feel to it, which may be unhealthy to some. Check it out.",The House That Jack Built

I am usually not a fan of Horror but had heard quite a bit about this film after the Cannes walk out. But do not be led away from this film, it is very good. Matt Dillon's portrayal of a sadistic, OCD, and manipulative serial killer named Jack is near perfection. The film has some very sick and disturbing moments but understand they are there to distance you from feeling any empathy for his character. The film has scenes of extreme violence and gore so if you do not like that I do not suggest watching. It is not so much the gore though, some scenes such as the murdering of children while are not graphic are disturbing.

The story just jumps around and it never completely explains why he becomes a serial killer. It is so ridiculous how he killed people and got a way with it in a small town for 20 years. Nothing exciting, thrilling, or interesting happened.The ending does not even match the movie. It is so bland in the beginning then tries to become some weird artsy crap that does not make sense. The portrayal of death and hell is so terrible. There was only one good creepy scene with his house close to the end. How do people get funded for terrible movies like this.
