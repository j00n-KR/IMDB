0,Leofwine_draca,Not one for purists,3,25 September 2020,"Inevitably as I'm not in the target teen market for this film I ended up hating it, but then I'm a guy approaching it as a fan of Conan Doyle and authentic screen depictions of Sherlock Holmes, not this modernist teen fantasy version. And this film is pure fantasy, not even attempting to look into the moral codes and etiquette of Victorian society, but instead throwing in random disparate elements including all-female ju jitsu clubs and the sight of a random artistocrat cavorting around the countryside with a female minor. The plot hinges on a ridiculous, underwritten and uninteresting mystery, while the cast is littered with familiar faces ill at ease in their roles: Helena Bonham Carter, whose entire role is rather pointless; Henry Cavill, who couldn't be more miscast if he tried. The only decent performances come from Burn Gorman (once more typecast as an assassin) and the excellent Millie Bobby Brown, whose charisma and exuberance shine off the screen.",Enola Holmes
1,SnoopyStyle,the charms of MBB,7,26 September 2020,"Enola Holmes (Millie Bobby Brown) grew up with her mother (Helena Bonham Carter) as her teacher and best friend. She doesn't know her late father and her two older absent brothers. One morning, the sixteen year old wakes up to discover her mother has gone missing. Her brothers Sherlock (Henry Cavill) and Mycroft (Sam Claflin) return home. Mycroft is shocked that the house is in disrepair despite his various payments over the years. He insists that Enola attend Miss Harrison's strict finishing school to prepare her for a husband. She runs away to look for her mother. Along the way, she rescues young runaway Lord Tewkesbury (Louis Partridge) from an assassin and uncovers a conspiracy against political reform.Millie Bobby Brown has all the charisma in the world. Cavill is playing Sherlock as a detached loner and Claflin is bordering on villainy. There are two mysteries in the movie but they do not coexist easily. The big mistake is Enola abandoning Tewkesbury in London. It's a much better option for their chemistry to stay together and they create good chemistry later on after they reunite. It makes little sense that he doesn't join her in her search for her mother. It would also make the later encounters with the assassin a lot less awkward. One can always assume that the killer catches up to Tewkesbury. It makes less sense that he catches up to Enola when he had never seen her in a dress. It also makes more sense for Enola to go to Miss Harrison in the beginning rather than in the middle. In the beginning, she can build up her resentment which drives her to runaway. By the middle, she has already shown her independence and her abilities which makes it less likely for her to suffer under Miss Harrison. I watched the trailer after watching the movie and that's exactly what the trailer suggests. I'm not an original thinker. It just seems obvious. There are a few contrivances in the plot. There is also the reason for mother's disappearance. It doesn't get resolved to my satisfaction. It would make more sense if Mycroft already knew that she had siphoned off the money and intends to put her in an institution. The plot throws in so much with the Chinese gunpowder but does not pay it off in the end. The plot needs some better construction. Despite all that, I love MBB's screen presence and can't wait for more from this franchise.",Enola Holmes
2,Prismark10,Enola Holmes,5,24 September 2020,"Based on a series of Young Adult novels that introduced a younger sister of Sherlock Holmes.Enola Holmes has a remarkably mature performance from Millie Bobby Brown in the title role.Enola is a 16 year old independent minded teenager raised by her mother (Helena Bonham Carter) to be free spirited. Enola has had little contact with her two older brothers since they left home after the death of their father.When Mrs Holmes suddenly disappears, Her two older brothers reappear in her life. Mycroft Holmes (Sam Claflin) is her guardian and wants her to send her to a cruel finishing school. Sherlock Holmes (Henry Cavill) just sits silently gazing.It seems to be a mystery why the two brothers are not that worried that their mother has gone off somewhere.It is vibrant Enola who goes off to find her mother. She meets her mother's network of ladies in London. She also finds adventure with a runaway Lord Tewkesbury whose life is in danger.Enola Holmes is sloppy and overlong. It should had been a tighter and a more spirited adventure. The biggest problem is the characterisation of Mycroft Holmes. There have been interesting interpretations of him in the past by actors such as Christopher Lee, Charles Gray, Mark Gatiss. The Mycroft played by Claflin is a horrendous caricature. An uncaring chauvinist monster when he is supposed to be Sherlock's more smarter brother.As for Sherlock Holmes himself. Of course he is meant to have a smaller supporting role in this. Expectations need to be lowered as he is played by a plank of wood. I did expect Sherlock to be more concerned about the fate of his mother and sister and open minded to the feminist bent of this story. The character is just too passive.The film looks expensive, it is slick but also lacklustre. However I would like to see more Enola Holmes as played by Millie Bobby Brown.",Enola Holmes
3,kosmasp,Female Holmes,7,25 November 2020,"Sherlock Holmes ... has a sister? Interesting and why not? I know some may have issues with that, but think about all the girls who know can have some fun too. And that is the target audience. Young female viewers. That doesn't mean you can't have fun watching this, if you are not in that specific demographic. It just means, you are more likely to enjoy it, if you are.And while she is younger than Mr. Holmes himself and therefor a bit more ... fresh and has to learn certain things, that can also be the appeal of it all. Not to mention that Henry Cavill (a perfect bond? Maybe, but a great Holmes for sure as we can witness here too) is quite the genius casting. So while this may not tickle my bone as much as it did others, it still is quite well made. Entertaining and funny and really cool characters",Enola Holmes
4,Sleepin_Dragon,"It's good family fun, not to be taken seriously.",6,25 September 2020,"How wonderful would this film have been for teatime on Boxing Day, it very much has that cosy, family viewing vibe.If you're expecting a Sherlock style mystery forget it, this is a movie aimed at a younger audience, but it's not without merit.There's a mystery, dangers along the way, and a young Detective on the case who's set to face many dangers ahead.There is a fascination with giving Holmes a sister, we had Eurus a few years back, and now we have Enola, each has something to offer I guess.Sherlock is portrayed in an interesting way, no fault with the acting, buy he's so incredibly sweet and caring, almost cuddly.It's beautifully made, it features a super cast, I'm sure it will appeal to a younger audience. You'll see plenty of familiar faces along the way, I thought Fiona Shaw in particular was very good.As we head into another lockdown, this served as a sweet, uplifting escape. 6/10.",Enola Holmes
5,lee_eisenberg,it goes to Eleven,7,8 June 2021,"I should start by noting that I've never read any of the books depicting Sherlock Holmes's younger sister. In fact, I've never read any of Arthur Conan Doyle's original novels. Coming into ""Enola Holmes"" completely unaware of its background, I was pleased. The point is to be entertaining, and the movie is just that. In a role quite different from Eleven on ""Stranger Things"", Millie Bobby Brown plays Enola as a vivacious girl out to challenge the Victorian era's gender norms while solving a mystery. It's nothing spectacular, but will be enjoyable if you have nothing else to watch.",Enola Holmes
6,Tweekums,A fun Nineteenth Century investigation with Sherlock Holmes' younger sister,8,27 September 2020,"This film is centred on Enola Holmes, the sixteen year old sister of famous detective Sherlock. She was raised by her mother after her father died and brothers left home. When her mother mysteriously disappears she is made the ward of elder brother Mycroft, he intends to send her to boarding school so she runs away; determined to follow clues left by her mother. On the train she crosses paths with the young Viscount Tewkesbury who has also fled his family and is being searched for by a man in a brown bowler hat. She helps him escape and once in London they part ways... it isn't too long before she realises that she must help him if she is to solve her own problems. While she is undertaking her investigation brother Sherlock is looking for her.I really enjoyed this film despite not being in the target demographic. It was fun from start to finish; largely thanks to Millie Bobby Brown's brilliant performance as our eponymous heroine... I'd be very surprised if she doesn't become a major name in Hollywood. The character is spirited and likeable, delivering occasional fourth wall breaking comments to camera. The rest of the cast, which includes several familiar faces also impresses. The story provides some nice twists and turns and some genuinely tense moments, but nothing too scary for all but younger children. There is also plenty of humour but nothing too forced. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody after fun, inoffensive, family suitable adventure.",Enola Holmes
7,blanche-2,family entertainment,7,20 November 2020,"I agree with one of the people who posted here. People very often view a film not for what it is, but what they either think it should be or want it to be. As the poster pointed out, this isn't a Quentin Tarantino film. It's well-done family entertainment about the adventures of a young woman, Enola Holmes, as she sets out to find her missing mother.She's Sherlock's sister, and Sherlock and Mycroft appear in the form of Henry Cavill and Sam Clafin. I did not feel they registered much. The real star is Millie Bobby Brown as Enola. Her mother is played by Helena Bonham-Carter, Frances de la Tour, Louis Partridge, and Fiona Shaw make up a very good cast.The film has wonderful production values, and I wonder if there are plans for future adventures of Enola. The film is really for teenaged women, and it's a lot of fun, with its emphasis on creative imagination and girl power.People may tune in because of the Sherlock connection, but it's not really about him. It's about his sister. Amazing how that family keeps growing.",Enola Holmes
8,CinemaSerf,Engaging tale of sleuthing with a twist.,6,21 October 2020,"This is quite a fun Holmes-ian adventure story that reminded me a bit of ""Young Sherlock Holmes"" (1985). Millie Bobby Brown is ""Enola Holmes"" the younger sister of her famous sleuth of a brother. When her mother unexpectedly absconds, she finds herself destined for a finishing school and abhorred by the prospect escapes and heads to London to search for her mother. On the way, she encounters the young ""Lord Tewkesbury"" (Louis Partridge) who is on a different sort of, and far more dangerous, adventure - together they must unravel a dangerous conspiracy that goes straight to the heart of the Kingdom. It's got plenty to enjoy, the two leads gel well and together with Helena Bonham-Carter as her mother, the occasional appearance from Henry Cavill and Sam Claflin as her elder brothers as well as a seemingly much shorter (than in ""Goblet of Fire"" (2005), anyway) Frances de la Tour as the young peer's grandmother it moves along quite nicely with a certain charm, albeit it a slightly precocious one. This is a good looking yarn that also takes us on a journey that helps ""Enola"" discover a little bit more about herself - a clever, intuitive,15 year old girl in an all male world she is determined not to be trampled by.",Enola Holmes
9,Calicodreamin,A bit boring,5,24 September 2020,"The storyline was a bit bland and disjointed, a lot going on but no substance. The acting was fairly good and the costumes were great. The looking into the camera narration was borderline creepy and didn't add anything to the story.",Enola Holmes
10,evanston_dad,Not the Target Audience,4,6 October 2020,"I acknowledge that I'm not the target audience for this movie, but come on, it still could have been more entertaining than it was.""Enola Holmes"" is a heavy handed girl power movie that awkwardly tries to jam a 21st century female empowerment theme into a corset. The movie is annoyingly aware of itself -- the main actress is always looking straight into the camera, winking and smirking and talking to the audience like we're part of the action -- but not good enough to pull it off. The movie wants to have its cake and eat it too. Enola is a feminist role model for young girls yet the movie still seems to find a way to stick her tomboy character in a restrictive Victorian gown so that she can look pretty. It's ok, you see, because she CHOOSES to wear the dress as part of a disguise. She then proceeds to do martial arts while wearing the dress, which pretty much negates every point the movie made up to that point in time about how corsets were just one convention society engineered to keep women contained in their place.Young girls might like this movie. Maybe?.....Grade: C",Enola Holmes
11,deloudelouvain,"Millie Bobby Brown, only fifteen here, guaranteed we will see a lot of her in the future.",8,18 December 2020,"For me to like a movie I ask myself some questions. Was I entertained? Was the cinematography of good quality? Were the actors doing a decent job? Was the story somewhat enjoyable to watch? On all of these questions above I have to answer yes. My wife wasn't that thrilled about Enola Holmes, rating it a six, just because the main character was talking directly to us, the audience, but I on the other hand thought that was a clever thing to do to tell her story. Millie Bobby Brown, well known since the brilliant series Stranger Things, is definitely an actress that we will see a lot in the future. Don't forget she's still only 15 while playing Enola Holmes, and the least we can say is that she's very convincing as an actress, very enjoyable to watch. No doubt she will become easy on the eye once she will grow up, so I can see a bright future in good movies for her. The rest of the cast did also a good job playing their respective characters. Henry Cavill is an actor that plays in good production and there's a reason for that. Enola Holmes is easy entertainment, just the kind I needed at this moment.",Enola Holmes
12,siderite,"Disjointed, but with great potential",7,24 September 2020,"The biggest problem with Enola Holmes is that neither her nor the writers of the film knew what they wanted her to be. Yes, it's one of those films created especially to be feminist, but it is also fun. Yes, Enola is a Holmes, but she is her own woman - this is not a gender swap film, but rather a story about a fictional sister of Sherlock. Yes, the mysteries she has to solve and the final twist are kind of lame and even so she doesn't quite get it, but that's all in the plan: she is but a child, not a replacement for adult Holmes. And yes, it features Henry Cavill, but for no other reason that he brings in an audience, as his role is arguably the smallest of the entire movie, if you discount that of Helena Bonham Carter, who is also cast for audience fishing purposes.Many will be put off by the feminist agenda dumped expositionally in the first 20 minutes of the show and other will be put off by the middle part of the show which pretty much cancels those first 20 minutes. But the worst sin of the movie is that is a disjointed mess. Millie Bobby Brown is perfect for the role, but she jumps from fourth wall breaking exposition to dangerous situations, then joking, then someone deciding her life for her or trying to kill her, then young love, then solving mysteries, then finding her lost mother then putting England on progressive path and all without a real plan. She solves ridiculously easy anagrams and calls them cyphers, she stumbles upon things that have little bearing to the story, while the villains keep stumbling upon her from sheer coincidence. The story just happens to the characters and very little of what they do is actually of any consequence.Bottom line: a combination of a children movie with a feminist story while tangentially referencing Sherlock Holmes played by Henry Cavill to bring audiences in. Well acted and directed, but the story is puerile.",Enola Holmes
13,lasttimeisaw,Film Review - Enola Holmes (2020) 6.2/10,6,7 October 2020,"A retcon of the proverbial universe of Sherlock Holmes, ENOLA HOLMES pushes his much younger sister in the forefront, and pertinently asserts a modern feminist manifesto in the person of our 16-year-old heroine.Enola (Brown), ""alone"" spells backwards, is raised by her mother Eudoria (Carter), after the latter vanishes into thin air on the day of her 16th birthday, Enola, for the first time, embarks on a quest on her own, to seek out the truth. Whilst, her two more world-savvier elder brothers Mycroft and Sherlock Holmes (Claflin and Cavill, both presumably on board for a fat check other than any artistic ambition, since their contrasted acting chops, one goes hyperbolic and the other opts for low-key condescension, are so awfully inconsequential) are not entirely helpful in that aspect, the former persists in dragging her to a finishing school run by Miss Harrison (Shaw, a marvelous harridan), whereas the latter uncharacteristically seesaws about whether or not he should be emotionally invested in his sister's growing pains.Enola is a remarkable young woman, mostly courtesy to Eudoria's unconventional methods of upbringing, she is fostered and trained to be intelligent, erudite, independent and martial arts-savvy (a throw-down with Susie Wokoma's Edith signifies that she still has a long way to go in refining her skills, but the token inclusion of Wokoma feels short-changed, that is a black woman who can give Sherlock a piece of her mind!), all the qualifies to be standing out from the crowd. Yet, introducing a new detective in the renowned family, ENOLA HOLMES is not much fun in solving the puzzles, Enola's mission is waylaid after she saves the young Viscount Tewkesbury, Marquess of Basilwether (Patridge, trapped in a gender-reversed damsel-in-distress role but his fresh-faced earnestness is quite a catch) from being dispatched by a merciless bowler-wearing killer Linthorn (Gorman). Some physical violence might be too squeamish for audience who are attuned to chick-lit flicks (Enola must take some hiding to toughen up), but the ultimate trigger-puller is expectedly the least we should expect, and Enola is none the wiser in deciphering that. Also, the story half-asses about Eudoria's mysterious disappearance, coded message-sending aside, no real deduction or intrigue is required here.Indefatigably maneuvering the fourth-wall-breaking gimmick à la the hit TV series FLEABAG, with which the film shares the same director Harry Bradbeer, ENOLA HOLMES, for what it is worth, purveys the young Millie Bobby Brown (who is also one of the producers of the movie) a period stage (pleasingly digitalized, though looking shoddy when the action accelerates) to show the potentiality of broadening her (already massive) demography of audience, and she makes a good fist of it, a pert role model of her age, her Enola is an inspiration feels authentic, merely due to the actor's exuberance and alacrity (not that the script offers her any justice), it is a new IP for her to rest on in a long run, provided that some ingenious work from scenarists can be secured in its inevitable sequels.",Enola Holmes
14,cherold,Tremendously fun Sherlock spin-off,8,1 December 2020,"The girl from Stranger Things proves she's more than an intense tortured child with her sprightly performance as Sherlock Holmes kid sister, Enola Holmes.This is very much a movie aimed at adolescent girls, so an old man like me wouldn't be expected to enjoy it so much, but I like most things Sherlock Holmes, from the stories to the Rathbone films to junkie-Holmes treated by Freud to idiot-Holmes fronting a brilliant Watson to dozens of other fun variations (and, of course, some really terrible variations like that Gene Wilder thing). And while a sister is a new wrinkle, it's a very successful one.Millie Bobby Brown is great fun as the charming and unconventional Enola, who chats with the camera and throws herself headlong into adventure. The movie is fun and funny, with a good sense of period, and moves at a steady clip. Henry Cavill is excellent as a rather dream-boaty Holmes. Like many Holmes variations (but generally unlike the very focussed stories), Enola Holmes offers two parallel mysteries, one involving her missing mother and another centered on a snotty young Lord. They are both perhaps somewhat scattershot in plotting but are thoroughly enjoyable.The greatest flaw, from a Sherlock perspective, is Mycroft, who is portrayed not as Holmes' even more brilliant but sedentary older brother but rather as a bland businessman of normal intelligence. I am all for adding ideas to the Holmes mythology, but I don't see any point in taking an interesting character and turning him into a dull antagonist. Still, it's a minor aggravation.There is a strong feminism theme in the movie that seems to have really aggravated the anti-woke brigade that devotes itself to complaining about such things. They act like it's inappropriate to inject feminism into the time period, as though they don't know things like suffragettes once existed. (Notably, the reform bill that figures in the story was not, according to Wikipedia, one that offered suffrage to women, but only to a greater number of men. But it was still progressive, which I guess is the point.) Personally, I'm a fan of the whole equality thing but if you're not you should probably just stop watching modern movies and stick to the old black and white ones (avoiding certain actresses like Katherine Hepburn who might still bruise your delicate sensibilities).Anyway, this is a really fun movie, I hope there's a sequel, it looks like Brown will be more than flash in the pan, and you should watch this.",Enola Holmes
15,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Elbayojne. That's 'enjoyable' backwards.,6,11 October 2020,"Though 'Enola Holmes (2020)' is undeniably messy and its ending will likely leave a lot of people somewhat disappointed, the majority of this 'Sherlock Holmes' spin-off is an enjoyable adventure with a relatively unique style. Its central mysteries aren't all that complex or involving and its 'find yourself' theming has definitely been done before, but the piece moves at a fairly quick pace and is bolstered by solid performances from its entire cast. Surprisingly, it's constant to-camera narration actually works rather well, cementing the thing's distinct style and storybook feel. It's sometimes a bit too violent for its own good, raising its 'bar for entry' a little too high than it ought to, and it's also tonally inconsistent overall. However, it's typically a fair bit of fun when it's underway. Despite its issues, it's an entertaining family film with some heavy-handed but important themes of female empowerment. 6/10",Enola Holmes
16,ThomasDrufke,A Win For Netflix,6,2 June 2021,"Perhaps Netflix's two biggest stars right now, Millie Bobby Brown from Stranger Things and Henry Cavill from The Witcher, teaming up to do a Enola/Sherlock Holmes film? Count me in. Playful, cheesy 120 minutes later, you can see the appeal the film has towards a family audience, something Netflix typically struggles with, but it's undoubtedly a winner for the service. While it won't give you the thrills that Guy Ritchie's Holmes films did, I quite enjoyed Enola Holmes.6.7/10.",Enola Holmes

I also wasn't fan of ending and whole movie didn't catch me. It wasn't bad made movie, it just wasn't for me so I can't give less than 7. I don't know if I would recommend to watch this movie because it's very hard to describe what genre it was.",Enola Holmes
18,Cineanalyst,Sherlock Jr.,6,24 September 2020,"I didn't know Eleven and Superman were siblings... but, it makes sense.Based on derivative young adult fiction from Nancy Springer, as opposed to Arthur Conan Doyle's original tales of Sherlock Holmes, the game that is afoot in ""Enola Holmes"" is of a different sort than that of detective fiction--at least of the good kind. Although, nominally, there are mysteries (where's the mother? how is the boy's life in danger?), their solutions are far too easy for anyone other than, perhaps, the kiddie readers originally intended for the text. The machinations of the story are simple--even hackneyed. One walk in the woods, as Sherlock's teenage sister, Enola, has only begun her second investigation, and an experienced viewer will already know what the twist will be. Indeed, it's elementary. To cite a more recent example; it's no ""Knives Out"" (2019). That's not the point, though, or at least it's not the main appeal of this movie.A good mystery is about plot, principally. One manifestation of this in the Holmes stories is the surrogate author within the story, a.k.a. the stupid friend, Watson. But, ""Enola Holmes"" is about character and place, including the entire dynamic of patriarchy versus women's suffrage. In this regard, it's delightful--a fish-out-of-water tale like ""Wonder Woman"" (2017), of an exceptional young woman entering London society to track down Ares (or her mother in this case) and being distracted by a young man in the process. Or, even more to the point, of Eleven from ""Stranger Things"" in search of her mother, but who is distracted by boys along the way. It's not only Doyle's more ""emotional"" Holmes, as the series became more about its popular character, that's being ripped off here--I mean, serving pastiche. The meta-narrative device employed here, too, is the titular, fourth-wall-breaking narrator talking directly to and sometimes winking at the audience in the vein of, say, ""Deadpool"" (2016), but more juvenile, or, depending on how you look at it, less juvenile. Enola invites us on an adventure of discovery of her place in this world of detective fiction, and if this does become a franchise, now that we have Superman instead of Iron Man and Doctor Strange, too, maybe we'll get a real mystery next time. At least, for now, Millie Bobby Brown is fun to follow around, including an exciting train sequence and action-movie fight scenes, and the supporting cast features some hefty talents in Henry Cavill and Helena Bonham Carter to assist in the lighthearted, if lightweight, affair.",Enola Holmes

20,ops-52535,a nearly flawless production,9,23 September 2020,"Netflix has founded yet another brilliant movie, this time about enola holmes, mycroft holmes daughter and sherlocks niese. its a kind of detective story, where many people actually search for eachother. its also a story about womens liberation rights, sufragettes etc etc, but most of all its a lighthearted tale about a rather pecuiliar and special young girl that has an intelect and wisdome that outmanouvers even sherlock. having been brought up in a secluded mansion somewhere rural england, homeschooled and educated by her mother, who have made learning into a game of fun. but one day mum suddenly disappears, and enola has to search the trenches of the world,e.g. england to find her mum.its an extremely well conducted story with lots of shift, flashbacks and fun, made in a cgi'ed colonial era visualls, extremely detailed in its comprehensiveness, and a production design only a few can overthrow. the only factual flaw i could find obvious, was the newspaper formats, they didnt use tabloid newspaper format in the 1880's it was broadsheet all over the line in these days.. locations, and sound and filmography makes this a flick to look at more than once , just to study small details in the peripheryactors are doing well over average, not oscar worthy, but fun , entangling and fresh. the story is told in the ''i'' format, where the focus at the story is told by miss enola, or alone backwards, that maybe a way to ruin a films truthfullness, but here its compelling and driving the story very well. the actual casting job are quite brilliant, with loads of well known actors from brittish film and tv-productions from the past 50 years. bravissimo...so if you will have an adventure from the past told through the words of a young girl, then do this fun ride of twists and turns that you would never ecpect. a big recommend from the grumpy old man",Enola Holmes
21,cruise01,Decent mystery film with the start of a franchise for Millie Bobby Brown.,6,17 November 2020,"3 out of 5 stars.Enola Holmes is a fair mystery film. About Enola (Millie Bobby Brown) who goes on a investigating search when her mother disappears played by Helena Bonham Carter. While Sherlock (Henry Cavill) and Mycroft (Sam Claflin) show up to claim the property.It is a decent story about a coming of age story. Enola having to self discover and find her purpose. She was the closest to her mother. While her brothers were away. Solving crimes. But when the mother goes missing. Enola takes the matter into her own hands. When there is something more going on when she runs into a run away young man. Who is needing help and has a bounty on him. Meanwhile, Sherlock and Mycroft spend there time on the sidelines. Trying to bring Enola back.Millie Bobby Brown delivered her role well. She seemed to have fun with the role. While breaking the fourth wall telling her narrative of the story to the audience. Sam Claflin and Henry Cavill were also decent playing the sideline characters with not much to do.I did find the direction to be drawn out with the two hours. Felt a little longer than it should have been. But it does try to have a fun decent start for a franchise.",Enola Holmes
22,eddie_baggins,A fast-paced but forgettable addition to the Sherlock cannon,5,25 September 2020,"If there was one thing the cinematic universe probably didn't need it was yet another iteration of the Sherlock Holmes universe but proving once more Hollywood the film world in general seems to be content resurrecting and re-imaging properties until they are no longer filled with any life left in them, along comes Enola Holmes.A Netflix original that see's Stranger Things superstar Millie Bobby Brown take on her biggest role yet outside of the smash-hit TV series in Harry Bradbeer's feature debut adaptation of Nancy Springer's family friendly novels, Enola Holmes is a well-shot and performed tale and is sure to find its fair share of young fans but there's a heart and soul lacking here as well as the spectacle that more recent Sherlock oriented tales such as the well-liked Benedict Cumberbatch starring series and Robert Downey Jr. films had in spades.Making Henry Cavill's Sherlock a mere side player to Brown's sister of Sherlock Enola's adventures and investigation into the disappearance of their mother that turns into a cat and mouse game involving Louis Partridge's well-off teenager Tewkesbury, Enola Holmes rockets along at a rollicking pace and provides some great English period scenery and sights but despite Brown's charismatic turn (proving that Stranger Things is far from a fluke), there's a sense of a film here just going through the motions on its quest to create a new Netflix feature film series and attract Brown's growing fanbase into this world.With her often speaking directly to the audience and with an audacity but vulnerability that makes her ever so human despite her smarts and gifts, Enola is a likable creation and suits Brown perfectly but Enola is stuck in a rather ho-hum story that wanes far more often than it flies and its a shame the film didn't manage to find a suitably fantastic story to have its star and lead character act in.There's also a strong sense that Cavill, Helena Bonham Carter as Eudoria Holmes and Sam Claflin as the grumpy and moody Mycroft Holmes are all mostly wasted in the narrative. With little to do the well-liked and talented performers provide a welcome presence to the film but don't provide much of any substance, perhaps it would've been wise for the film to allow Brown and Cavill in particular more time together in the narrative as you can sense the relationship between these two talented siblings could've provided a real spark to the films mediocre story.Final Say -A family film that does what it promises to do but in a mostly uninspired fashion, Enola Holmes is a great showcase for Millie Bobby Brown but this new take on the Holmes name will need a far more memorable outing next time around if its to become a long lasting addition to the brand.2 1/2 suitcases out of 5",Enola Holmes
23,Tweetienator,Rather Lame,5,24 September 2020,"Millie Bobby Brown is super-cute and charming, that's the strongest point of Enola Holmes (including that talking to the cam technique). The rest is a rather p.c.-burden dull story with a solid production. Maybe young ones will like it (and that's I guess the target audience for the adventures of Sherlock's younge sister), I was rather slightly bored. Most Sherlock Holmes movies I know, not only the old classics (Basil Rathbone!) and the new ones with Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law alike, including Young Sherlock Holmes and the Pyramid of Fear (watch if you don't know that one!) are superior to this ""Tomb Raidered"" version (not those good ones with Angelina but the ""modern"" interpretation with Alicia Vikander). My rating is a 5 but one point I added only for the charming performance of Millie Bobby Brown.Diabolic note: like Adam was first and Eve second (according to the Holy Bible), the creation of the character of Enola is also second to the creation of the wonderful Sherlock Holmes by the titan Arthur Conan Doyle. What you conclude of this final note, I leave up to you.",Enola Holmes

The performances are good, especially Brown, again proving to be one of the great young actors. The dialogue pops, the directing is full of heart, & the general air of the film is so bright & relentless it would've ruled in theatres. It's also overwhelmingly disposable & shallow. The style is...a lot. I admire the desire to not be boring, but it needs more purpose behind it; the fourth wall breaking grows especially tiresome. In the end, its great potential succumbs to be merely OK.",Enola Holmes

27,southdavid,Get Carter,7,29 September 2020,"Timely adaptation of the Nancy Springer books, not just because of its female centric outlook, but also as it's been a minute since either Benedict Cumberbatch or Robert Downey Jnr donned the deerstalker.With both of her brothers long since moved out, Enola Holmes (Millie Bobby Brown) grows up under the tutelage of her mother (Helena Bonham Carter) who encourages practical skills and research above more ladylike pursuits. When her mother vanishes suddenly overnight, Enola follows a series of clues to investigate her mother's life, whilst avoiding her pursuing brothers and rescuing young Marquis Tewksbury (Louis Partridge) from an assassin.I almost really loved ""Enola Holmes"". It gets so much right. The casting is perfect. Henry Cavill and Sam Claflin play Sherlock and Mycroft respectively. I understand that some have been upset about this version of Sherlock being nicer than other portrayals but honestly, you have to have different performances of a character, or what's the point in doing it? In this all they do is make him relatively nicer than Mycroft, but he's not emasculated or weakened in anyway. There's a supporting cast of decent faces from UK television, Burn Gorman, Adeel Akhtar, Susan Wokoma, David Bamber, Frances de la Tour, Claire Rushbrook and Fiona Shaw all bringing something to their characters. Louis Partridge, who has the character most likely to be insufferably annoying manages to find the right balance - keeping his character posh but not stuckup, unworldly but not dumb - it's well done. The world building is good too, a solid Victorian London and several stately homes. I liked that Brown is narrating the film straight into camera too. It's far from a new idea, but it's fun here and she's engaging and charming doing it.The flaw is the specific story. Essentially it's two cases, her missing mother is one - but then focus shifts to the assassination attempt of the young lord and who is behind that. Neither of which is particularly clever and both of which are a little anticlimactic.Give me a sequel, with a new case and less of the introduction stuff to deal with and I'll be all over it. This was, as I say, just lacking in that one element to stop it being brilliant.",Enola Holmes

29,Vartiainen,"At times rather good, at times preachy",6,1 November 2020,"Enola Holmes is based on a book series by Nancy Springer, which is in turn obviously based on the Sherlock Holmes novels by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In Springer's books Enola Holmes is the younger sister of Mycroft and Sherlock, and every bit as precocious as them. But naturally, this being Victorian England, she's held back tremendously by her lack of outie genitalia. If you'll pardon my language, good sir. A fact the film constantly reminds us about.When the film is not being all ""I'm a woman, hear me roar!"", it's actually quite good. Millie Bobby Brown, of Strangers Things fame, is very good in the leading role. She has the attitude, the looks and most of all the solemn earnestness the character sorely needs. Sam Claflin and Henry Cavill as Mycroft and Sherlock, respectively, were also quite good, and I enjoyed the exaggerated dichotomy between them. It was almost satirical with the reedy Mycroft played by Claflin standing next to the beefcake that is Henry Cavill, but I got the impression that their characters were seen from Enola's point of view. Hence the exaggeration between the hated and the idolized brother.I also enjoyed the craftsmanship on display. The sets looked great, the costuming as well. The action set pieces were shot well and there was vibrancy to it all, as well as cleverness.But yeah, the feminist agenda is really on display in this film. And in a really jarring, shove it down our throats way. The film would probably worked a lot better if it had had the courage to be a bit more subtle about its message. Because the message itself is fine. I have zero problems with it. I just don't like when the story suffers because the writers feel the need to put a pause to it every few minutes in order to climb on their soap boxes.Not helping the matters is the romantic interest that's still very prominently in the film. I mean, there's some lip service paid to the fact that Enola doesn't need or want a boy in her life, but the boy in question is still so clearly a clichéd romantic interest that it's painful to watch. I mean, if you want to spout the feminist agenda, at least stay away from the obvious pit falls.Still, there are a lot of people that will have no problem with the preaching. And to those people I heartily recommend the film. To the rest of you, it's still quite good. Not perfect, but good.",Enola Holmes

33,alindsay-al,An Average Film That Could Have A Bright Future,5,23 September 2020,"So a few months ago we heard that this film was coming to Netflix and today was that day and here is my review for Enola Holmes. The premise of the film sees Sherlock Holmes teen sister have to go on her own investigation when her mum goes missing.Main Character
Millie Bobby Brown of Stranger Things fame plays Enola Holmes and honestly I thought she was the best part of this film. She is really charming, charismatic and fun to watch, she actually has a nice arc throughout the film and she is just a good lead character. You see that she has been poorly treated and it makes you care about her and want to see her one up her brothers as they annoy her throughout the film and treat her poorly. If we get more of these films I think she has a chance to really build an interesting character here.Supporting Characters
Sam Claflin plays her older brother called Mycroft and I thought he did a decent job, yes his character is pretty generic and you know he is going to be an antagonist but he does a good job in the role and seems to be enjoying himself here in the role. Now Henry Cavill is a great actor and he plays Sherlock Holmes here and I just thought it wasn't the right fit, it's not that he is bad, it is just that he doesn't fit the character and it feels like he is miscast and his character is pretty poorly written, especially, with how he ends up. Helena Bonham Carter plays her mother and she doesn't do much in this film, it just seems that she is a terrible mother and it makes you wonder if Enola would be better without her. Also there is this love interest here and it didn't work, I just wish this film didn't have a love interest as tgis felt like a forced part of the film.Story
The story when it comes to Enola is well done. her character is interesting and the development is there. You see how smart and capable she is and it allows you to take her seriously as a protagonist. But then the rest of the plot happens, her relationship with her brothers isn't explored enough, the search for her mother is forgotten about and then there is this dull political story involving the love interest and none of it is interesting. The film tries to have twists and turns but they make no sense and you are literally given no reason to care about any of it, apart from Enola herself.Script
The script is fine, with Enola herself having some good dialogue that just makes her very likeable, also I liked how she worked out the clues and I thought that was pretty well written. But then the drama isn't there and it honestly feels like they were writing 4 films in one, the script is too unfocused and makes it difficult to focus and get invested into anything.Style
The style of the film is entertaining, Enola does her best Deadpool impression by breaking the fourth wall alot here and I actually thought it worked, you don't see it much and I liked its usage here, even though it is never quite explained why she does it. But the pacing of the film is poor and as I mentioned the film is pretty unfocused which leads the ending to feel rushed and wonder what has happened.Overall
Overall, this is a pretty average film, but surprisingly I actually want to see a sequel. I like the character of Enola Holmes and I think with a more focused film the sequel could be much better. But this film isn't really worth your time unless you are bored and have a few hours spare.",Enola Holmes

36,snoozejonc,Entertaining but could have been better,6,10 October 2020,"Teenager Enola Holmes runs away from the guardianship of her older brother to search for her missing mother.This film has a lot going in its favour. Excellent lead performance from 'Stranger Things' star Millie Bobby Brown, great cinematography, fun graphics and a strong theme of female empowerment running through it.I'm one of those forty year old males who this movie was not aimed at but I enjoyed all of the above and am happy that both my daughters have stronger female characters to see compared to ones my generation grew up watching.Unfortunately i did find the story a bit long winded and when Enola addressed the camera it felt a bit gimmicky.It's often difficult when mixing a plot with exposition about a character's beginnings, but this one mixes two mysteries and origin details into a two hour run time. There were a number of scenes that brought the momentum to a halt.As for 'breaking the forth wall' as film buffs like to say, I think it worked well in 'Deadpool' because the dialogue was so funny, but personally I don't think it works here. Maybe it is something different for viewers that have not seen this type of thing before but I don't think the story needs it. I felt the same when watching 'House Of Cards'.The vibe of the film feels more Marvel than Sherlock Holmes, with its jujitsu, funky graphics and action sequences. I suspect this is something studio executives demand these days in order to maximise profit. It's not a bad thing in this case as enjoyment of the movie might prompt people to explore Nancy Springer's novels or even Arthur Conan Doyle original Sherlock Holmes books. That being said the Sherlock who appears in this movie is portrayed by a good looking, muscular star of the superhero genre who gives the character a sensitive side, clearly another marketing decision.Overall I found it entertaining but it's probably not one I'd rewatch.",Enola Holmes

I didn't love the constant ""fourth wall breaking"", but Brown helps make it work to the point it didn't get annoying.Louis Partridge impresses too. Henry Cavill and Sam Claflin are strong casts to play Sherlock and Mycroft. I liked seeing Burn Gorman and Adeel Akhtar in their respective roles.

43,masonfisk,BROWN MEETS HOLMES...!,7,19 January 2021,"The recent Netflix adventure film starring Millie Bobby Brown as Sherlock's (& Mycroft's) younger sister. Based on a series of novels by Nancy Springer which posits what if Sherlock had a younger sister who was trained in all aspects of education (books, art, etc.) as well as being adept in judo (by their mother played by Helena Bonham Carter) soon decides to join the family business . When Carter disappears one day leaving behind cryptic clues, it appears Brown has gotten her first case, if only Mycroft wasn't so insistent on her getting proper tutelage which he reckons'll be found in a finishing school run by Fiona Shaw. No sooner than this decision has been made for her, she embarks on an adventure (dressed as a boy) hopping a train & landing in the lap of another case (the scion of a well-to-do family has also flown the coop & is being pursued by a nameless assassin, played by Burn Gorham). Jumping off the train & making their way to London proper, the youths separate w/Enola finding herself in a modern world (cars are coming into fashion & the suffrage vote is soon upon England) she'd probably only read about. Fine for what it is but probably I'd say a little late to the punch (since Nancy Drew got a recent new movie & CW TV series), this film still succeeds due to Brown's winning charm (& let loose from all the heavy lifting she does on Stranger Things) & gee whiz speed of the narrative which is only stopped in its tracks when Brown is brought back to Shaw's school for an unnecessary & repetitive life lesson. Henry Cavill & Sam Clafin acquit themselves nicely as Sherlock & Mycroft, w/Cavill being more window dressing (considering there are at least 3 other actors who have portrayed the prodigious detective on TV & film within the last decade or so) letting Brown to come to the fore. Also starring Frances De la Tour (she played Hagrid's girlfriend in the Harry Potter films) as a powerful aging dowager & Adeel Akhtar (one of the terrorists in Four Lions) as Inspector Lestrade.",Enola Holmes

45,s3276169,Oh the irony......,5,1 October 2020,"I'll start by saying this is not one for me. Its pitched squarely at teenage girls. My concern is the rather nasty underlying message about men, that's part of the baggage.Classic one liners like ""you are only a man if I tell you you're a man"". There's plenty more besides, painting men as symbols of female oppression and ignorance. Even her name plays to this seudo feminist notion, Enola is ""alone"" backwards.What's really ridiculous about all of this, is its railing against history. Using an anachronistic stick to beat out a message that's already been received in more enlightened, contemporary, times.But then, in my opinion, this is what feminism has been reduced to in the Western media. A caricature, that has become more fashion than cause. There's no small irony too, that the only way this ""pitching at windmills"" can function is through the appropriation of an essentially masculine tale.in short, this could have been a charming, likeable,quirky tale, that entertained. Acting is excellent, backed by a broad cast with strong credentials. Cinematography cant be faulted either, nor quality production values.Its a shame too, as no one actually minds the tale of Sherlock Holmes taking a novel female turn.

Few action scenes choreographed including the train chase, the fight between Enola and the hitman at the Limehouse, Enola meeting Edith in London are well executed.Unfortunately, Enola Holmes suffers from the half-baked screenplay as the film's pace trends downwards with lot of loopholes. On top of it poor editing towards the second half spoils the mood of the film. There is a scene where Marquess helps Enola escape from the headmistress room in the boarding school which seems so easily done. Sherlock Holmes movies and even web-series boast off some mind-twisting climax. However, the climax scene presented in Enola Holmes was not thrilling at all.Technically, Enola Holmes looks beautiful on screen with 1880's era picture of London is well-depicted thanks to the fantastic art direction, cinematography and good CGI.Enola Holmes belongs to Millie Bobby Brown. Though her expressions are same throughout the film, she carries the film with a good performance and does well in the action scenes. We are so much used to seeing Robert Downey jr and Bennedict Cumberbatch in the Sherlock Holmes roles that it is difficult to digest any other actor. However, Henry Cavill does create a strong impression even though he is not the central character film. The other actor which I liked was Susan Wokoma as Edith and Louis Patridge as Marquess. Helena Bonham Carterm as usual was superb.So, overall, Enola Holmes carried mammoth expectations from its trailer which got salvaged by weak script and poor direction. Watch it if you like a decent period mystery action thriller. Average 2.5/5",Enola Holmes
57,Sergiodave,Pretty good,7,29 September 2020,"'Enola Holmes' follows the adventures of Sherlock Holmes' young sister played by Millie Bobbie Brown. The cast was superb, and the story, okay, but I think as the first in what I imagine will be a few movies, sets the scene for future mysteries well. A good Netflix movie, looking forward to more.",Enola Holmes
58,vithiet,"Super fun, light, and entertaining!",7,28 September 2020,"No, it's not a Sherlock Holmes movie, not a mystery movie, not a historical piece, etc. but haters gonna hate I guess. It's supposed to be the fun story of Enola Holmes' coming of age and it is great for what it is. Very good acting (anyone who watched Stranger Things could tell Millie Bobby Brown was going to do great things and this is cementing her path towards being the next big Hollywood thing), directing, and writing though the pacing is a bit uneven at times. But overall I recommend it for everyone; it makes for a great family movie as well!",Enola Holmes
59,IonicBreezeMachine,A great performance from Millie Bobby Brown elevates this YA franchise starter,7,11 October 2020,"Enola Holmes (Millie Bobby Brown), younger sister of Sherlock and Mycroft, has lived in the countryside all her life with her mother Eudoria (Helena Bonham Carter) learning all manner of unconventional skills and sciences. On the eve of Enola's 16th birthday Eudoria disappears which sets Enola off on an adventure to find her, picking up a runaway Marquis Tewkesberry (Louis Partridge) and evading her oldest brother Mycroft's attempts to send her to a boarding school.Enola Holmes is based on the eponymous series of books by Nancy Springer, chronicling the heroine's adventures geared toward a YA audience. I've not read the series myself, and cannot speak towards the faithfulness of the adaptation, but as a movie it's a respectable start to a clearly intended franchise anchoring by a solid performance by Stranger Things' Millie Bobby Brown.Brown is an absolute delight playing Enola and not only brings the intellectual prowess one would expect from a teen sleuth related to endearingly timeless detective Sherlock Holmes, but also gives the role a sense of humor and energy that helps to bring the character to life. The movie is also given solid direction by veteran TV director Harry Bradbeer (killing Eve, Fleabag) and keeps the film moving with a sense of forward momentum that manages to maintain audience engagement. The supporting cast are also quite good. Despite being essentially a glorified cameo, Henry Cavill (The Witcher, Man of Steel) embodies the character well and has some very nice character based moments between himself and Brown where he brings a level of sweetness and humanity to Sherlock that isn't usually seen. Louis Partridge is also quite good playing Tewkesbury, a runaway Marquis who finds himself tangled up in Enola's own complications which leads to them repeatedly crossing paths throughout the movie. This is Partridge's first major role having had some minor roles in films like Pan and a deleted scene in Paddington 2, and he shows himself to be a charismatic an appealing actor whom I hope to see more of.Unfortunately despite being relatively solid the movie does still have some drawbacks. The case that Enola embarks upon I didn't feel to be especially engaging. There's essentially two cases in the movie 1) Eudoria 's disappearance and 2) who is trying to kill Tewkesbury. The cases are tenuously related to a degree, but the first case is basically dropped in favor of pursuing the second one later in the film and it makes the film feel somewhat less like a full story than it should. This wouldn't be that big an issue were the case more involving, but unfortunately the case is not only overly easy to solve, it doesn't much in the way of intrigue relating to it either.Enola Holmes is an entertaining mystery adventure that is geared towards a family audience. The film features good performances across the board as well as strong direction from a first time feature director, but its story unfortunately isn't as engaging as one would expect from a feature carrying the iconic Holmes name. Despite these drawbacks there's a lighthearted sense of fun and adventure to be had and should prove entertaining to its target audience.",Enola Holmes
60,MadamWarden,HOLMELY DELIGHT,6,13 October 2020,"A fun little movie with really fun characters, script and cast.Brown is growing into a talented actor and clearly enjoys herself in this escapist role.An entertaining little bit of merriment.",Enola Holmes
61,thekarmicnomad,I didn't want to see this - but I am glad I did,9,29 September 2020,"I was not looking forward to this.
From the trailer it looked quite silly and heavy on the old girl-power theme.I have never done a 360 so quickly.
Right from the start this film has great characters, a novel story, a fanciful setting, and a boundless energy.The acting and casting is amazing.
Millie Brown and Henry Cavill are especially note worthy but the whole cast is outstanding.There is a strong, positive message for girls and Enola is a great, likable character and the film doesn't feel the need to get on a soapbox.This is not a true Sherlock film in that there is no conundrum to be solved, it is more of a high adventure yarn with some small elements of deduction.The only comment I would make is that this does get a little bogged down with Victorian politics that younger children may find a little heavy going.
Either way there is a fight or a chase sequence right around the corner.This is a great, fun film that happily bounces along to a great climax.
A great film",Enola Holmes
62,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A charming and fun fanfiction-like story in the Sherlock Holmes universe.,8,7 November 2020,"When a character like Sherlock Holmes is already written, you do the next best thing: write fanfiction. Enola Holmes (2020) feels like an author-insert fanfiction of the famous detective stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. While this would be a mark against any other story, it works here and creates an amusing plot that was fun to watch. Sure, the mystery wasn't at the level Sherlock Holmes would normally solve, but Enola isn't necessarily Sherlock. Of course, I don't know if this story would have worked as well if there wasn't the tie-in to Sherlock Holmes.As for the actors, no doubt on retainer from their other Netflix projects, Henry Cavill (The Witcher) is a passable Sherlock but wasn't given quite enough screen time to really show his talents. The star of the show is definitely Millie Bobby Brown (Stranger Things), who has certainly shown that she's not only good at playing a teenager with psychic powers. I could have done with quite a bit less fourth-wall-breaking in this film, though, as I wondered if I was watching a Deadpool movie more often than should be prudent.While Enola Holmes seems to be the start of a franchise, I wonder if future installments will continue with this movie format or if they'll start to take after the BBC's Sherlock format with movie-length episodes. At the very least, Enola Holmes is a cute and charming movie that can stand by itself. That being said, I still have many unanswered questions regarding Enola's mother. It felt her character arc was incomplete-or at least it could have been better integrated into the story presented here to provide answers linked to the overarching plot.A charming and fun fanfiction-like story in the Sherlock Holmes universe, I give Enola Holmes 4.0 stars out of 5.",Enola Holmes
63,Holt344,"Enola Holmes has a large entertainment factor and good acting behind itself, but lacks in a satisfying second half",7,23 September 2020,"Millie Bobby Brown is Enola Holmes, her performance was great, energetic and overall interesting to watch, I've heard so many good things about her performance in Stranger Things but I can only tell from this movie and she was incredible in the role as the intelligent young Enola Holmes. The story has her on a mission to find her mother who disappeared, she takes help from her two brothers Sherlock and Mycroft but she ends up doing it alone and it was the right thing for Enola Holmes to do. The character is interesting and intelligent, the dialogue is on point and overall writing was perfect for her. In my opinion the first half was great and the second not so good but the acting of the three Holmes siblings made it entertaining.Henry Cavill plays Sherlock Holmes and he did an amazing job, I want to see him get a spin-off movie. Henry Cavill amazes me again and again. So did Sam Claflin, his performance as the older brother Mycroft was strong and believable. I can say that the movie was rightfully cast, maybe Lestrade was the only one that was lacking but it was the writing for the character that was off and not the actor. Lord Tewksbury was a character I didn't really like, maybe it was the huge presence the actor had in the movie, there's nothing wrong with him but I felt the movie would have worked better without a love interest.The editing is great and fast paced which makes the story move very fast, it isn't for everyone but it works with Millie's energetic performance and the feel-good atmosphere that the film has.
The writing isn't great but it ain't bad either, it's okey. Some could argue that Enola breaking the fourth wall doesn't have a place in the movie but let me make an argument that it works for the movie, right from the start we get to know that Enola is alone and likes her own company and that can lead to the said person talking to herself. Bear with me here, I find it great that there is a huge amount of feminism in this movie but there's too much of it at times, now there were feminism in that time but it feels like there's too much of it in some scenes which makes it unrealistic but it's an entertaining movie that a lot of people could watch and enjoy.This isn't one of those incredible movies that leaves you mind blown, it doesn't try to be that kinda movie. Instead, it's a fun adventure movie for the whole family, a Netflix Original for all ages. Millie Bobby Brown did a great performance and so did Henry Cavill and Sam Claflin. There's more books and stories with Enola Holmes and I will tune in again if we get a sequel.",Enola Holmes
64,bankofmarquis,A winning (enough) combination,7,18 October 2020,"I'm a sucker for Sherlock Holmes. I grew up watching the fantastic black and white Holmes films from the 1940's starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. I checked out '70's Holmes flicks like MURDER BY DECREE and the 7 PERCENT SOLUTION and then re-fell-in-love with Holmes with the Jeremy Brett BBC SHERLOCK HOLMES TV series of the 1980's and, of course, Benedict Cumberbatch's modern take on the master sleuth in the 2000's was ""must see TV"" for me. I was even on-board with Robert Downey Jr's. ""take"" on this iconic sleuth and was thrilled when Sir Ian McKellen portrayed an elderly Sherlock Holmes in MR. HOLMES.So...I eagerly awaited the Netflix treatment of the ""younger"" sister of Sherlock Holmes in ENOLA HOLMES -and, I gotta say, I wasn't disappointed.Based on the Young Adult series of novels by Nancy Springer, ENOLA HOLMES introduces us to the (heretofore unknown) younger sister of Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes. Raised by a fiercely independent mother in the late 1880's, Enola goes searching for her when she goes missing and gets mixed up in the ""The Case of the Missing Marquess"" along the way.Millie Bobbie Brown (STRANGER THINGS) is a winning, charismatic (enough) performer as Enola. She is a steady and sure hand at the helm of this ship throughout the course of this 2 hour and 3 minute adventure. While I would have liked her to command the screen more with her presence, she does enough to make it a good, solid, effort.The supporting cast is just as good. Helena Bonham Carter (FIGHT CLUB) is perfectly cast as Enola's (and Sherlock's and Mycroft's) mother - she has that fierce streak of independence and ""don't mess with me"" energy while carving her own path. She is the type of character that one would go looking for if she went missing. Sam Claflin (HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE) is finely unrecognizable (at least to me) as Mycroft - written in this piece as the more ""traditional"" of the Holmes family and Henry Cavill (MAN OF STEEL) brings a strong arrogance to his portrayal of Sherlock. He also brings something else - heart - to this character, a character trait that has ""traditional"" fans of this character up in arms. For me, it works well in the context of this film.As for the film itself - it is good (enough). I found myself enjoying the mystery and the characters and enjoyed my time in this world. It's not anything new, but it's like putting on a pair of old shoes - comforting to wear.This is an adaptation of the first book of the series, and I, for one, hope that there are more. It's a winning combination that was pleasant to watch.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Enola Holmes

66,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Good cinematography and acting but ...,6,3 October 2020,The cinematography and the acting is on point; very well done. The feminism is annoying but I overlooked it because everything else with the film was fine. If only these film and television producers understood you don't have to make the males into clowns to build up a female one. But saying that is like beating a dead horse already. Makes you think whether America loves its male children? Good thing this is a streaming movie because I would not have purchased the BluRay or rental.P.S. Nothing against the actors. I thought they were all fantastic. Just the writing I have an issue with.,Enola Holmes
67,abisio,Good but only for young women,7,29 September 2020,"I love Millie Bobby Brown and in this movie he really shows charisma and acting chops far beyond Stranger Things.
She is even realistic when fighting and natural when talking to the camera or lovable when punished for not being girly enough.
Boys are mostly decorative (ring a bell) and adult men are stupid or authoritarian or selfish (perhaps all together).The point is; that as fun as it is seeing Bobby doing her stuff; the movie does not make a lot of sense; She and Cavill who is quite charismatic but the rest of the characters do not generate any empathy (male or female).Even Helena Bonham Carter is forgettable and miscast as the mother.The movie is acceptable for up to 15 years old; but is not a Sherlock Holmes mystery and the killer identity is immediately clear for the public, long before the characters find out.In brief; entertaining and good to see with your kids but as adult do not lose your time",Enola Holmes
68,bob-the-movie-man,The unsinkable Millie Bobby Brown,7,4 October 2020,"Sherlock Holmes never had a sister. But if he did, what adventures would Enola Holmes get up to? That's the premise behind this Netflix feature. starring rising star Millie Bobby Brown.Enola Holmes (Millie Bobby Brown) thinks she's been named as such because it spells ""alone"" backwards. (But then, she admits, that it doesn't seem to follow for either kcolrehs or tforcym!)Enola has been brought up by her dearest mother Eudoria (Helena Bonham Carter) to be a strong and confident woman, free of the normal 19th century rituals of ladylike husband-seeking niceties: for her, it's all mental gymnastics and martial arts. But when on her 16th birthday her mother vanishes, Enola sets out on a quest to find her. But Eudoria is a Holmes, and knows the value of clues and how to cover her tracks.Of greater concern to Enola is her brother and ward Mycroft (Sam Claflin), who is intent on packing her off to the Victorian finishing school of Miss Harrison (""Killing Eve's"" Fiona Shaw). But while trying to escape from her brothers - not a trivial matter when one is the famous detective Sherlock (Henry Cavill) - Enola encounters a Marquess on the run (Louis Partridge) and adventure, intrigue and murder are on the cards.Filming in this ""Fleabag"" style - where the lead is constantly breaking the fourth wall - requires a confidence in delivery that many young actors would struggle with. But not Millie Bobby Brown. Her asides and camera glances - while not quite as skillful as the astonishingly accomplished Phoebe Waller-Bridge - are nonetheless impressive and constantly entertaining. An underwater wink at the camera was particularly enjoyable.So... actress - tick!But perhaps more impressive to me was that the 16 year old - most famous for her role in ""Stranger Things"", which I still haven't watched - was also a PRODUCER of this movie. Which makes me think she is a serious person to watch in the movie business (if there ever is a movie business left after 2020). I read that she is the youngest person ever to appear on the annual list of the ""world's 100 most influential people"" by Time magazine: so others agree!The supporting case are a broad array of British acting talent, with Henry Cavill being particularly appealing as Sherlock, Burn Gorman at his slimy evil best as a murderous henchman, and Sam Claflin being as anonymous as I always find him. (That's a compliment by the way: whereas I see some actors and think ""oh, there's 'Tom Hanks' again"", I never recognize Claflin until the credits role... he is a chameleon of the acting world).But acting the socks off everyone else for me is Frances de la Tour as the Marquess's grandmother. A deliciously twinkling and charming performance from an old dame of the screen.The similarities with ""Fleabag"" are not coincidental, since the director is Harry Bradbeer; director of all of the episodes except the original pilot. But it's unfortunate in some ways that the style has been interpolated into the Holmes story. Since, of course, this approach was previously done by Guy Ritchie in the two very entertaining movies featuring Robert Downey Jnr and Jude Law. And for me, that's a shame. Since although the styles are markedly different - here we have a lot of Paddington-style cardboard animations - the ""feel"" of the films is the same. As such, it doesn't feel as novel as it should do. Why couldn't she have been someone else's sister? Houdini perhaps? Or Oscar Wilde?As two hours of entertaining escapism, Enola Holmes worked well for me. Brown is eminently watchable, and given the Netflix response to the movie, a sequel would be - I expect - on the cards.(For the full graphical review, please visit One Mann's Movies on t'interweb or Facebook.

71,tm-sheehan,Good family entertainment for the holidays,7,4 December 2020,"I enjoyed Enola Holmes think of Jane Austen meets Sherlock Holmes the characters all interested me more than the plot ,which is well written by Screen writer Jack Thorne. I really like his previous movies like Wonder (2017) and the fantasy series His Dark Materials which is currently screening its 2nd Series on Foxtel.Enola Homes is set in the England, of 1884 - a world on the brink of change. It's over 50 years on from Jane Austen's Georgian /Regency era but we're still introduced to similar and sometimes eccentric characters of that time.
Especially two women characters I loved The Dowager played exquisitely by the wonderful Frances del la Tour and the stern overbearing disciplinarian Miss Harrison , who is commissioned to try and turn the spirited Enola into a gentile. lady. Played by the equally wonderful Fiona Shaw these 2 women add so much to this movie.The story based on a novel by Nancy Springer titled The Case of the Missing Marquess ."" an Enola Holmes Mystery so perhaps there are more to come.
On the morning of her 16th birthday, Enola Holmes (Millie Bobby Brown) , who tells her story in the first person and is a delightful actress . I've realised I don't really like movies narrated by the main character it seems obtrusive to my enjoyment of the story ,especially in the recent movie The Personal History of David Copperfield .
Our heroine wakes to find that her mother (Helena Bonham Carter) has disappeared, leaving behind an odd assortment of gifts but no apparent clue as to where she's gone or why. After a free-spirited childhood, Enola suddenly finds herself under the care of her brothers Sherlock (Henry Cavill) and Mycroft (Sam Claflin), both set on sending her away to a finishing school for ""proper"" young ladies.
This Sherlock Holmes is the handsomest so far and a contrast to his miserable manipulating brother Mycroft ,who treats Enola with contempt.
Enola refusing to follow her brothers wishes, escapes to search for her mother in London. But when her journey finds her entangled in a mystery surrounding a young runaway Lord (Louis Partridge), Enola becomes a super-sleuth in her own right, outwitting her famous brother as she unravels a conspiracy that threatens to set back the course of history.
This would be a nice film to watch during the holidays it's good family entertainment and pretty as a chocolate box .
Enola Holmes is very well acted , well directed by Harry Bradbeer who directed The Cops, 1998, Fleabag 2016-2019) and Killing Eve (2018)",Enola Holmes
72,legobuilderpro,Holmes,6,26 September 2020,It was fine watching and a nice mystery watching and Henry cavill was good as sherlock.But some of it was a little slow,Enola Holmes
73,msbreviews,Enola Holmes is... fine.,6,23 October 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)2020 is unquestionably one of the most challenging years movie theaters ever had to face. The still going global pandemic closed down everything, including my favorite place to spend the most wonderful time. Therefore, the already growing streaming services got a huge bump, earning more and more subscribers during this tough phase in our lives. Netflix has been extremely busy releasing brand-new flicks since the beginning of the year, being The Devil All The Time, I'm Thinking of Ending Things, and Project Power the latest. Some better than others, but I'm still to find a 2020's original film from the studio that I genuinely dislike. Is Enola Holmes the first one?Well, no, far from that. With such a talented cast and high production value, a new take on the classic Sherlock Holmes' mysteries is certainly welcome, and this is one of my top two compliments. Debutant director Harry Bradbeer and Jack Thorne (His Dark Materials) offer a refreshing twist on the famous detective's stories, not only by focusing on her less popular sister instead but also by delivering a different Sherlock than the one we're used to seeing. The editing (Adam Bosman), cinematography (Giles Nuttgens), and score (Daniel Pemberton) contribute to quirky, fun, captivating scenes that help the viewer follow Enola's assessment of several situations, including her thought process (interpretation of clues, formulating plans), most of the times by breaking the fourth wall.This last aspect takes me to my other top two praise, Millie Bobby Brown. She's the reason why these sequences work so well. From the moment I first saw her in Stranger Things, I genuinely believed she would be a star. For the past few years, I've constantly left in writing that she will break the Oscars' record for the youngest actress to ever win a Best Actress award. Millie still has a bit more than five years to achieve that, and she's already leading major blockbusters like Godzilla: King of the Monsters. With this Netflix movie, Millie proves once again her versatility (already portrayed completely different characters in distinct genres), emotional range (effortlessly delivers any type of scene), and mature acting (rarely overacts or doesn't offer enough, she's always on point).She incorporates Enola in such a unique manner that I struggle to find a better choice to play this character, who is herself also a standout. Enola's arc feels genuinely empowering. It doesn't feel like a forced political statement nor a narratively illogical decision to develop this character in the way Thorne does. Every enigma she tries to decipher, every plan she needs to create to save someone or something, every choice she makes feels earned and justified. Enola doesn't let herself be restricted by old society's rules of how the world should work. She wants to be herself without having to answer to nobody. It might be a generic message, but it's transmitted through seamless execution.Regarding the rest of the cast, Henry Cavill is a major surprise as Sherlock, and I won't be shocked if it generates some controversy (update: it did). It's a notably different version of the distant, emotionless, overly analytical Sherlock that Robert Downey Jr. and Benedict Cumberbatch interpreted, which I embrace with open arms. I don't care about rights or origins. A character is what the actor and writer(s) make of it, it doesn't belong to anyone let alone its ""fans"". Cavill shows a cheekier display than what he's used to presenting, and Thorne adjusted a couple of specific traits from the classic character. Louis Partridge and Sam Claflin are both excellent as Lord Viscount Tewksbury and Mycroft, respectively. The remaining actors all offer decent performances, but the two standouts are undoubtedly Millie and Cavill.As for the film itself, I was ready to write ""it's fine"" half an hour before I finished it. Even though it feels unique in several areas, Enola Holmes still follows a pretty generic story, with formulaic plot points and the usual character drama. Sadly, it doesn't really bring anything new story-wise. It features no surprises, which is not a good attribute for a movie with a central mystery. However, that lack of enthusiasm leads me to a significant issue I didn't expect to find in the latter half of the film. Its mystery isn't truly one, and it's set aside midway through the movie, which is a questionable narrative decision. I don't remember the last time (if ever) where a film completely discards its main storyline (one that received an entire first act of set up), replacing it with a young-adult romantic endeavor (which is pretty convincing, but not as a main storyline).I'm a firm advocate of the trailer-free methodology. Expectations can make or break the viewer's opinion about a movie, and nowadays, trailers can be deceiving, misleading, and show way too much. I missed everything related to this film, watching it 100% blind. Had I watched Enola Holmes' official trailer beforehand, I'd definitely be inclined to the negative side of the divisive line I stand on right now. Its trailer focuses on what most people will expect from the movie: the main mystery surrounding Enola's mother disappearance. Considering how the film actually goes, it's safe to write that its trailer is a bit deceiving.All in all, Enola Holmes offers a pleasant, refreshing take on a franchise that might have a new future now. Focusing on Sherlock Holmes' sister, Harry Bradbeer and Jack Thorne deliver a light, fun, entertaining story, packed with action, clues to decipher, and a brilliant cast. Millie Bobby Brown keeps climbing up the stairs of success, demonstrating her versatility, range, and maturity as a young actress. It's a matter of time until she becomes one of the most coveted actresses in Hollywood. Her chemistry with Henry Cavill and Louis Partridge is phenomenal, and her fourth wall breaks are fascinating. Technically, Enola's thoughts and feelings are perfectly transmitted to the audience through outstanding editing, cinematography, and score. However, story-wise, it's as generic as it could be, boasting absolutely no surprises, and a central mystery that's not quite one. It's still a fine Saturday night flick to enjoy with family and friends but be advised: its trailer is a tad misleading, so keep your mind open and expectations grounded.Rating: B-",Enola Holmes

Millie certainly has a strong supporting cast working with her too - they're just rather underutilized. Henry Cavill gave one of the best portrayals of Sherlock Holmes I've seen.I still have no idea what that romantic interest boy's name was. But that's probably half the point. The men and boys here are just but a sideshow to Enola Holmes and the empowering themes for women throughout. I'm glad young women are getting more and more cinematic role models.While I wasn't the target audience, 'Enola Holmes' still kept me entertained, without being truly remarkable. I probably will have forgotten this by tomorrow, though I'm curious where a potential franchise of this goes.",Enola Holmes

79,0w0,Disappointing and not worthy of having 'Holmes' in the title...,5,1 October 2020,"The Sherlock Holmes series (2010-2017) is fantastic, with a 9/10 score.
Both the Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011) movie and Sherlock Holmes (2009) movie, is very good, with an 8/10 score each.SO WHY ON EARTH if the recent movies/series was such highly acclaimed productions, would they deviate so massively from the formula AND do an entire recasting of all the actors while they're at it? It's no wonder then that this movie ended up being only a 5/10 affair. It contains no comedy and honestly very little intrigue, which is something that the above-mentioned titles all had very much of. And with a budget of $60 million, it's truly difficult to see where all that money went to... I mean, the first RDJ Sherlock Holmes movie had a budget of $90 and that movie was filled with massive set-pieces and impressive action sequences, yet this Enola Holmes movie is quite honestly lacking of anything like that.So it has no comedy, little intrigue, no action to speak of and doesn't even have a finished ending... the movie literally ends after 120minutes with NO explanation or resolution of the BIGGEST plot detail in the entire movie (which is of course Enola's mother). Why would you spend 2hours exploring the actions of Enola's mother, and then at the end give literally no explanation of it... it's the dumbest and most disappointing ending to a movie that I've seen in ages.If you're looking for a great movie/series in the Sherlock Holmes universe, then rather watch the titles I've mentioned above, and stay far away from this movie... it's not worth your time and will just lead you along for 2hours only to ultimately disappoint you in the end.",Enola Holmes
80,mfellipecampos,Weak,4,26 December 2020,"Weak story! Funny. But some scenes are weak (half-mouthed), not being the height of the story. It's not ""super exciting / intriguing"" like the rest of Sherlock.Film seen on the 24th to the 25th of December 2020.",Enola Holmes
81,MrDHWong,"A fun, free spirited adventure lifted by an engaging performance from its lead actress",8,1 October 2020,"Enola Holmes is a coming-of-age mystery film based on the book ""The Enola Holmes Mysteries: The Case of the Missing Marquess"" by Nancy Springer, which itself is loosely based on the stories of Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Starring Millie Bobby Brown in the title role, it is a fun, free spirited adventure lifted by an engaging performance from its lead actress.In 19th century England, Enola Holmes (Millie Bobby Brown), the younger sister of the famous detectives Sherlock Holmes (Henry Cavill) and Mycroft Holmes (Sam Claflin), has been taught by her mother Eudoria (Helena Bonham Carter) to be just as clever, observant, and proficient in hand-to-hand combat as her older brothers. On the morning of her sixteenth birthday, Enola awakens to discover her mother has disappeared, leaving her with a deciphering device and scattered clues hidden away in some flowers. Believing these clues lead to her mother's whereabouts, Enola sets off on a journey and follows the trail to London. Meanwhile, Enola's brothers desperately try to track her down, albeit, with their own conflicting methods of deduction and detective work.The Sherlock Holmes series of stories I believe needs no introduction. Its impact on pop culture and storytelling still resonates strongly even after more than 130 years since the very first book was penned by its author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. As is often the case with something this popular, there are bound to be spin-offs featuring either some of its core characters or brand new ones existing within the same universe. What ""Enola Holmes"" does successfully is invent an entirely new relative of the Holmes family, in that of a strong willed little sister. This works well as it can introduce a new generation of viewers to this classic series with a young protagonist they can identify with while also bringing a fresh burst of originality that casual audiences can appreciate as well. Like her older brothers, Enola finds great joy in solving mysteries and using her intellect to discover important clues along the way. Since the story is set in an era where women were expected to act more ladylike, it certainly makes scenes with Enola fighting through the social norms of that time all the more fun to watch. I'm not sure if this happens in the book, but she often breaks the fourth wall, directly addressing the audience over how she has been raised to handle any predicament she lands herself in or even what certain clues might mean if they seem too complicated for the casual viewer. This was a fun quirk to add to a film like this and I'm sure that young people will find it all the more entertaining as a result.Director Harry Bradbeer has clearly taken a great deal of influence from that of the works of Guy Ritchie. Ritchie's brisk, fast-paced, choppily edited approach to filmmaking has been heavily applied here, which seems appropriate considering he directed the 2009 and 2011 contemporary film adaptations of Sherlock Holmes starring Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law. This definitely prevented the film from becoming boring or dragging at any time, as it manages to hold the audience's attention throughout the story. However, I do feel that certain aspects of the film's plot may be confusing to some younger audiences, mainly the one involving the passing of an important government bill in the House of Lords. Even though the film doesn't dwell on this aspect for too long, I can't help but feel that any youths who may be watching will be scratching their heads over what the implications of such a bill passing will mean to our protagonist. Older audiences should have no trouble of course, but considering this film is clearly aimed at teens to young adults, I just wish this was handled somewhat better.In what can be best described as her most fun performance to date, Millie Bobby Brown simply owns the role of Enola Holmes. Brown, who also serves as an executive producer for the film, injects so much peppy energy into her portrayal of this character that one cannot help but feel charmed by her and her eagerness for adventure. But this wasn't simply a one actor movie, as both Henry Cavill and Sam Claflin were also enjoyable to watch as Sherlock and Mycroft, respectively. As has usually been seen in most forms of Sherlock Holmes media, the two brothers don't always see eye-to-eye and often clash over their opposing views of the world around them. Here, Cavill plays Sherlock with a more laid back personality, supporting whatever path his younger sister wishes to follow, while Claflin plays Mycroft as a more strict and conservative older guardian who wants his youngest sibling to succeed in social settings. This dynamic added some nice additional drama to the film and showed how much they care about their little sister, even if it is for different reasons. Additionally, it was also interesting to see both Brown and Cavill using their natural English accents, as I am so used to seeing them play American characters.With there already being so many prior adaptations of the Sherlock Holmes stories, this film definitely feels like an enjoyable contemporary inclusion to this ever-expanding library of reimaginings of this long-running series. Since this film only covers the first of six books in ""The Enola Holmes Mysteries"", it seems inevitable that at least one more sequel is on the horizon. As long as Millie Bobby Brown, Henry Cavill, and Sam Claflin are set to return, then count me in.I rate it 7.5/10",Enola Holmes
82,meydiana-65242,10 out 10. Had great time with this movie.,10,23 October 2020,"I've seen many people have disliked the film because of ""historical inaccuracies"" and it's feminist ideas. I must respectfully say, as much as I respect your opinions, you've missed the point of the film entirely.Enola Holmes was not intended to be a masterpiece by Scorsese/Tarantino/James Cameron/Peter Jackson/Spielberg/Nolan et cetera et cetera and leave you with a powerful message or a million questions. This is supposed to be a fun family action/mystery for people of all ages to enjoy, with a hint of that familiar character that is the iconic detective of Baker Street. The film succeeded in its aims to be fun, a film to watch with others to unwind after a long day and forget about life. This film, along with a great story and stellar cast led by the always spectacular Miss Millie Bobby Brown, is exactly what this world needs at this moment in time.The aforementioned cast did brilliantly in their roles. MiIlie Bobby Brown pulls the character off excellently, managing to be a perfect blend of Sherlock and a regular teenage girl, creating a fantastic original character. Cavill and Claflin were exceedingly good (and at some points rather humorous) in their roles of the Holmes brothers and Helena Bonham Carter brings her usual brilliance to the table in her role. The film itself is fantastic, managing to entertain whilst working in the underlying subplot and message of women's rights.I'd highly suggest watching this film and if my argument hasn't persuaded you, let me ask you this; why do we go to the cinema but to be entertained?",Enola Holmes
83,cardsrock,Millie Bobby Brown carries a lifeless mystery,6,27 September 2020,"This film makes some odd choices. They present Enola as a strong, independent young girl, but have her immediately swooning over some boring boy and making all of her decisions based on this boy she just met. Tonal mismatch is the game that's afoot here as the film tries to be a mystery, teen romance, feminist revolution, and adventure story and none of it meshes very well. The ""mystery,"" if you can call it that, is dull and predictable. I also don't know what they did to Mycroft as his character is some over-the-top, evil caricature.There is some good here though. Millie Bobby Brown shines as the lead, though the constant fourth wall breaks are a bit jarring. The decision to cast Henry Cavill as Sherlock was brilliant and I would love to see him spinoff and continue the role in some manner. The scenes with Sherlock and Enola are by far the highlight of the film. The music and production design are both solid as well. The movie started off as very engaging, but soon drags for its excessive runtime.I wanted to like this film more than I did, but there was just a lot that didn't work for me. There's nothing wrong with presenting strong females, but this movie beats you over the head with it. Hopefully any future films fix these issues and try a little more subtlety with their messages.",Enola Holmes
84,CANpatbuck3664,Diverting Enough for Adults but a Slam Dunk as a Family Friendly Take on the Holmes Family,7,4 October 2020,"I had the same reaction everyone else did when I heard about Enola Holmes, did we really need ANOTHER take on the Sherlock Holmes and/or his family? But centring in on Enola was a different enough choice to justify the production. Enola approaches Mary Sue territory but the writer's handling of her struggle for independence and her determination to forge her own path in a man's world came across as genuine and very grounded. She's easy to like and while her skill set is diverse, her vulnerability with the disappearance of her mother also rings true. She's annoyingly talented (to be fair, Sherlock has always been that way in every incarnation of the character) but the creative team did a good job rounding out her character into a solid young heroine for kids. She is also buoyed by Brown's performance but more on that later.While the focus may be on Enola, we do get some familiar stylistic touches that both help the movie along but they also add enough to keep you interested. Enola consistently breaks the 4th wall and talks to the audience (its a fun dynamic, its a little hit or miss but again credit Brown for doing her best to sell it), Enola's ability to solve puzzles and fight oncoming foes are done with cutaways to previous experiences (just like the Guy Ritchie movies) and you also have some sharp dialogue. It all fits the genre well enough and gets the job done. I don't think this production had a huge budget but at least the costuming and the sets are solid, I didn't notice any shoddy CGI or clunky editing to interrupt the flow either.This is Millie Bobby Brown's showcase, she dominates the screentime and I'm happy to say she's largely up to the task. This was a good project for her to take, Enola is so different from 11 on Stranger Things. She's expressive in this (she's great in Stranger Things but Eleven is a pretty dour and dramatic character, Enola gives her room to stretch) and she has to run the whole gauntlet. Is there the occasional awkward beat? Yes, there are times where she looks a little uncomfortable. But it was nice see her do something different and she succeeds (I was a little worried that her success might have been a one off after the lacklustre Godzilla: King of the Monsters). Henry Cavill is good as Sherlock but surprisingly, its not a rich part in this movie. He's clearly a supporting character and while he has a few nice moments with Enola, he's not as domineering as other actors have played this part. He's largely relegated to the background with Sam Claflin. I felt sorry for Sam, he's given little to do but mug and chew scenery as Mycroft. It seemed like the direction he was given was ""MORE SNOOTY!"" ""PRETEND EVERYONE ELSE AROUND YOU ARE GARBAGE PEOPLE!"" Claflin has more range then he's given credit for but this was a one note performance. Helena Bonham Carter does what she can, she works well with Brown and helps you buy their deep bond and understand Enola's loss when Eudoria leaves/is taken. Louis Partridge is fine as Tewkesbury, his character's friendship with Enola is at least passable and it wasn't too corny for a family film.My only gripe with Enola Holmes is that if you're an adult viewing this by yourself, minus a couple of good performances and some witty moments courtesy of the dialogue, there isn't a lot here. The mystery is pretty simple, any rough edges the story had have long been sanded away and the movie wraps up in a neat little bow. While I think Enola is a good enough effort, I can understand why Doyle purists or fans of the other Sherlock property would view it as a lesser version.By the time Enola gets past the climactic moments, I was happy enough with the final product but I don't think this was aimed at my demographic. If I were a kid, I would have loved this. Between the snappy dialogue, Brown's energetic performance, the 4th wall breaking and a simple enough mystery that avoids the edgy or hardcore aspects of the labour reform and suffrage movements, I would have been swept up in it. If you're really into the Conan Doyle's work or have a more than passing knowledge of this universe, there may be some continuity issues or implausible beats. But Enola was a decent couple of hours spent on Netflix and if you're expectations are properly adjusted, I'd recommend it as an undemanding but fun streaming experience for families.",Enola Holmes
85,cliftonofun,"Too many winks, but still plenty of smiles",6,4 October 2020,"At times this movie felt like a breath of fresh air, and at times it felt like a predictable Disney-ish live action adventure. Similarly, at times I was genuinely amused, and at times I was annoyed by yet another wink at the camera. It is absolutely worth watching this story with your kids - a great chance to introduce mystery and problem solving while elevating a great young female protagonist. (Brown is absolutely fantastic - funny, adorable, and relatable). But if the adults want a Holmes tale, they might be better off revisiting BBC's Sherlock.",Enola Holmes
86,garethcrook,"Bland, but maybe I'm too old and cynical...",5,14 January 2021,"Enola Holmes, Sherlock's little sister, wakes up on her 16th birthday to find her beloved mother, pretty much the only family she knows, missing. Enola (Millie Bobby Brown) lives in that most quintessential of British cinematic worlds, the 19th century countryside. Surrounded by rolling green fields, country houses, steam trains. Enjoying a life full of freedom, to think, express, learn, all thanks to her mother (Helena Bonham Carter). She's not pompous and prickly like her brothers Sherlock (Henry Cavill) and Mycroft (Sam Claflin), but she is pretty annoying, with a habit of breaking the fourth wall and delivering pithy yet futile remarks. Regardless the game is set. The big brothers are brought in to sort out Enola's wild upbringing and find their mother. They're of course going to fail at both. It's sadly a bit crap and feels like a TV episode that's been stretched far too thin. The actors are all a bit wooden, slightly purposely so in their prim analytical way, but again it's quite annoying. No more so than Brown who seems way out of her depth. It's a shame. Enola's story is one of her finding her way. Not the way that the men in her life and all men of the world tell her is the correct way. It deserves better really. So Enola runs away and finds her story entangled with Tewkesbury (Louis Partridge) who it has to be said is... annoying. It's all a bit ridiculous. It does look good, I'll give it that, but then this is a big production. Mercifully it does shift along at at decent clip too. It's an adventure and to be fair, perhaps one aimed at a younger audience than myself. It's rated 12 and has a similar tone to the Harry Potter films. All it's missing really is the magic. I wonder if I were 30 years younger, would I like this more? Brown will be hoping so, shes also a producer here and it's clear that the intention is a franchise. I don't think I could stomach another of these though.",Enola Holmes

It is nice to see Millie Bobby Brown grow as an actor from her most recognisable role as Eleven in Stranger Things.It's a different take on the Sherlock Holmes reimagined franchise.

This charming coming-of-age adventure movie is family-friendly entertainment that was acquired by Netflix shortly after the worldwide pandemic arrived. It's based on the Nancy Springer book series called, ""The Enola Holmes Mysteries."" If you enjoy playing the Scrabble Game, you'll get a kick out of the mystery Enola has to solve with her unique gift of unscrambling ciphers.Directed by Harry Bradbeer and written by Jack Thorne, this movie comes with a warning. There is a LOT of social justice warrior messaging. For some viewers, that will kill the fun journey of the film. Feminism is one of the movie's biggest themes, as the movie is set in England in the early 1920s when Woman's Suffrage was a dangerous endeavor. For those who don't mind all of that, it's a lot of fun.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

""The future is up to us!"" - Enola Holmes (Millie Bobby Brown)THINGS I LIKED:
Millie Bobby Brown is absolutely perfect as the spunky Enola Holmes, sister to the famous Sherlock Holmes. She earned a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress for her role in Stranger Things when she was only 13 years old! She's also the youngest person EVER to be featured on the TIME 100 list. Needless to say, she's talented and an absolute delight to watch in this movie. Did you know she's actually deaf in one ear? She has been trained in boxing in real life, making her believable in the action sequences. Enola breaks the 4th wall from the very beginning of the movie, which some viewers will think is annoying, but I thought it was endearing. It kind of reminded me of Matthew Broderick's banter to the audience in the movie Ladyhawke . I love that movie. Some critics have also complained that Millie Bobby Brown overacts in this film, but again, that's just one of the elements of the storytelling that I thought was cute.
Helena Bonham Carter is such a talented treasure. Another movie where she plays an unconventional mother is the fun and quirky The Young and Prodigious T.S. Spivet. I just discovered it the other night on Amazon! How did I miss that little gem?
The exuberant musical score by Daniel Pemberton is spirited in all the right ways and supports the energy of the movie.
I adore both leading men: Henry Cavill and Sam Claflin. Sadly, there has been some controversy and a lawsuit involving the Trust of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's estate regarding Henry Cavill's empathetic version of Sherlock Holmes, from what they say damages the source material and reputation. That sounds so British, right? Awwww, Henry. We love you and your heartwarming smolder. Unfortunately, I hear that a lot of his lines were cut in the film. He is a small part of the movie, but I'm glad he's there when he's allowed to be.
If the train looks familiar, it's because it's the same make and model used in all of the Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone franchise! If you're a fan of those movies (who isn't?) you'll also get a kick out of seeing three Harry Potter cast members reunited in this film: Helena Bonham Carter, Fiona Shaw, and Frances de la Tour.
There's one of those Pretty Woman ""you're not good enough to shop here"" moments in the movie.
The movie moves at a brisk pace, providing energy throughout the entire film.
It's certainly timely as one of its topics is the importance of voting.
If you enjoy the movie, you'll be happy that it ends with a hint of a sequel.
Fantastic production quality with great costumes and set design.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The movie has a strong feminist message and gets very preachy. For example, Enola's mother counsels her, ""Don't be thrown off by other people, especially MEN!"" It definitely reveals the writer's and director's political views or at least their attempts to jump on the female empowerment platform that appears in almost every movie nowadays.
Some are upset that this story is vastly different from the famous BBC series Sherlock (2010) or the source material. I don't know that it was ever intended to share the same world, only the last name. This isn't Sherlock's story, but Enola's in every way.
Some viewers have their knickers in a twist because of all the historical inaccuracies. Just don't overthink all of it and enjoy the adventure.
It's pretty predictable and doesn't take a lot of risks, other than changing the nature of Sherlock Holmes that we have come to know in other movies.
If you'd like a more historical, dramatic movie of the times, I suggest the movie Suffragette.
Some critics have complained that the movie is a bit too long. I enjoyed every minute, but I admit that there were a couple of times I thought the movie was ending, only to have another scene pick up.",Enola Holmes
91,sbweightman,"Good fun, but could have been more intriguing.",7,25 October 2020,"The mystery wasn't as traditional, complex or intriguing as I was expecting from the premise, but it is witty, stylish and clever. Great production values and acting with enough light-heartedness and action to remain entertaining throughout. The pacing and tone was a bit off at times and the Holmes brothers were a bit flat, but I suppose that's to be expected in a story about her.",Enola Holmes
92,PyroSikTh,Sherlock for Teenage Girls,5,25 September 2020,"When we first watched the trailer for this, I put it firmly in the 'not interested' list. It just ultimately looked like the kind of movie that just wasn't for me, and honestly that's exactly what it was. However my wife and I agreed that Henry Cavill as Sherlock Holmes was too hard to resist (and I say that as a perfectly straight male).But of course Enola Holmes isn't about Henry Cavill as Sherlock, it's about his little sister Enola, who has absolutely no basis in the stories of Arthur Conan Doyle, but I guess teenage girls need a proxy in order to enjoy these kinds of stories? And that's pretty much exactly how this movie plays out; Sherlock Holmes for teenage girls. The similarities between Enola and Sherlock are remarkable, down to the super smarts and personality quirks. Of course no story about a teenage girl would be complete without a super rich and boyishly handsome teenage love interest. Enter the young Lord Tewkesbury who has run away from his responsibilities fearing for his life after the untimely death of his father, and a nationwide manhunt commences, one that Sherlock is particularly uninterested in. Lucky for the young Lord that he bumps into Enola then, I guess.There's also the story of Enola's missing mother who vanished in the dead of night presumably to commit some terrorist acts in the name of the suffragettes, a detail which is perhaps wisely not pursued too far. And yet the lingering hints and unfinished business with it all in the end doesn't exactly leave a pleasant taste in the mouth. In truth this little detail is a little murky as it is, attempting to tie the whole story together under the banner of female empowerment, and yet Enola's life is still fundamentally driven by the men around her, either running from Mycroft's control, confiding in Sherlock, or becoming inextricably lured towards Tewkesbury and his problems. It almost certainly passes the Bechdel test, but when every woman in the movie other than Enola is portrayed as a proto-antagonist (including her own mother), it's maybe not quite reaching the point it so desperately wants to.Then there's the plot holes and conveniences that are sprinkled about, from magically omnipresent and all-knowing bad guys, to a final twist that makes little sense and is barely reasoned out in the movie itself, just in the name of pure shock value. I could also criticise historical inaccuracies as well, but I'm at least open-minded enough to acknowledge some liberties need to be taken for a compelling story.I'm not a particularly huge fan of Millie Bobby Brown, but I have to admit she does a remarkable job here, managing so much with so little. Her joy and her sadness are infectious, she carries the entire movie on her shoulders without any signs of struggle, and her fourth wall breaks are delightfully charming in every instance. Sam Claflin is perfectly antagonising as Mycroft, determined to make a lady of Enola and unwilling to realise her true potential, while Henry Cavill plays Sherlock with a softer and more empathetic side than the character is typically known for. Maybe it's just Cavill's natural charm that he is incapable of turning off. Yes, I would totally watch a Sherlock story with Cavill in the lead role. I need more. Helena Bonham Carter honestly doesn't get enough time, or a deep enough character to play with, but she's quite clearly set up ready to make a big impact in the sequel, whatever form that takes. Frances de la Tour and Fiona Shaw (more Harry Potter alumna) are also as dastardly and interesting as they need to be for the story.Enola Holmes is not a good movie, not by any means. It's another movie far too afraid of taking big risks, and so its message of female empowerment (written and directed by guys, no less) falls flat and shallow at best, and contradictory at worst. There are a lot of fun moments, and Millie Bobby Brown tears up every one of her scenes, but the mystery is so dull, the sub-plots irrelevant and distracting, and the teenage romance as cringy and irksome as they always are. As I said at the beginning, this film is quite obviously just not for me. It's Sherlock Holmes for teenage girls. I give it an unremarkable 5/10.",Enola Holmes
93,sweidman-28016,Exceeds Expectations,7,14 October 2020,"""Sometimes you must dangle your feet in the water in order to attract the sharks.""A Netflix movie aimed for teens and younger audiences actually turned out decent. Personally this movie didn't interest me because of this ideology that it would turn out as another disappointing and pointless movie. Plus we've had enough Sherlock Holmes movies and spinoffs. But there's a charm to this one. That's mainly due to the characters. Milly Bobby Brown transitioned nicely from her sci-fi roles in Stranger Things and Godzilla: King of the Monsters to a witty, likable character. She's the reason why I didn't feel the need to look at my phone or half-watch it. Her fun character made it worthwhile. The rest of the ensemble does the same as she does. Henry Cavill makes a great Sherlock, Sam Claflin is unrecognizable with both appearance and voice, Helena Bonham Carter plays a fun mother. Everyone matches the each other as their respective characters well.Harry Bradbeer became the main reason for watching once I found out he was in the directors chair. Fleabag is a literal masterpiece and the couple episodes of Killing Eve he directed are great. Knowing his work, this would be an at least fine movie. And it is fine. Similar to Fleabag, there's moments of breaking the fourth wall. That works in most cases but sometimes it didn't add anything. In one case, there hadn't been any fourth wall breaks in a while. They inserted one in and, to me at least, it didn't feel right there. Writer Jack Thorne is a hit or miss. I really liked his writing in Netflix's limited series The Eddy earlier this year, but he also wrote Radioactive, a lackluster biopic. In this case, his writing is good. The comedy hits well and its positive messages. Sometimes it's more focused on its message though. The main theme of the movie is to be yourself. After many scenes of characters getting the point across, it gets redundant.By the middle of the second act, the movie becomes predictable with both its content and pacing. It hits certain beats at certain times where I would've liked more variety with its storytelling. Not that I expected more, but it could've gotten to that 'good' tier of filmmaking. It's good but more on the 'fine' tier. Other than having a good time, there's nothing too special about it. I don't see Enola Holmes as a memorable movie that will be recognized years later. As an afternoon movie or sleepover for younger audiences, this is a great choice. This could've been a dud but with the great cast, good writing, and a good director this exceded expectations.",Enola Holmes
94,ethanbresnett,About as fun as I expected it to be!,6,6 April 2021,"I wasn't necessarily expecting great things from this film. The draw was the fresh take on the Sherlock Holmes story, and it was fresh enough to sustain itself and keep me entertained.I liked Millie Bobby Brown in her role. The character was fun a lively, with engaging fourth wall breaks, and as a result I couldn't help but get on board with her character and found her to be a solid protagonist. I was a bit unsure about Cavill as Sherlock, but his screen time was relatively limited so that's by the by really. On the flipside I really enjoyed Sam Claflin as Mycroft. The rest of the cast were all perfectly fine too.What really drags this film down is its plot. It felt a bit meandering and had a bit too much fluff and setting up to do. As a result I never felt fully emerged in the mystery, and when things did finally get going it wasn't all that intriguing or shocking. A Holmes story with a lacklustre case is always going to be fighting an uphill battle.Enola Holmes had a lot of promise with its great premise, but it didnt quite live up to this. Although if a sequel were to come along I wouldn't say no as I did enjoy the concept and tone of this film.",Enola Holmes
95,TaylorYee94,I couldn't bear to have this world be your future.,9,3 January 2021,"Some say 'Enola Holmes' juxtaposes gender as good and bad, but I say this is not true. It brings not only the subject of women suffrage but also the reform bill. While there are some female villains like grandmother and Ms. Harrison, Sherlock and Tewkesbury are crucial roles changing the world. Some say the storyline is terrible, but I can defend this as well. There are two main stories: finding Eudoria and death threat of Twekesbury, very clear. Two stories intertwine together naturally to lead to the ending, and they turn out to have the same goals: changing the world. It is a great twist that Enola's choice to save the life instead of finding Eudoria actually helps her to achieve the bigger plan. It is not complicated and very organized for audience to follow through.Holmes family's casting is magnificent, and so as their acting. I could not see Brown, Carter, Cavill, and Claflin in this movie. Actors performed designated roles and responsibilities perfectly, each of them having distinct personalities.",Enola Holmes

It would be generous to say the plot is thin, especially stretched to an over-long 2 hours, but in the context of such a well-executed, generous-spirited package that doesn't really matter. It barrels along with energy to power a high-speed train; imagine Phoebe Waller-Bridge has written an adventure film for the family and you're just about there. Millie Bobby Brown is excellent and charismatic as Enola, and even her 4th-wall breaking (often a risky strategy) is carried off with gleeful perfection. The supporting cast is superb, with a number of eye-catching turns; I especially enjoyed Fiona Shaw, a master-stroke of casting as the headmistress of a finishing school for girls. It works in its own right and as the establishing chapter of what will - if there's justice in the world - be a successful film franchise, with uncompromising feminist sensibilities and just the right spirit of fun.",Enola Holmes
98,SnobReviews,Entertaining but overall missing factors.,5,7 October 2020,"Perhaps most enjoyable for teenage girls; ""Enola Holmes"" is overall entertaining but the run time is the real issue.In this mystery film, the teen sister of Sherlock Holmes discovers her mother is missing and sets out to find her.There's no doubt that Millie Bobby Brown will become the next Keira Knightley. The young actress has proven herself over and over in ""Stranger Things"" and now transitioning into movies will make her an even bigger starlet. ""Enola Holmes"" is a good mystery but won't catch the attention of everyone who watches it. The film runs about half hour too long and there isn't enough action going on to keep your full attention. Maybe this film just needed to be seen on a big screen? I thought ""Enola Holmes"" was entertaining and will make way for other films in this franchise, but it could've been much better and oh yeah, shorter.Follow @snobmedia for all reviews!",Enola Holmes
99,waqassaleem-85201,Though it would be better,6,24 September 2020,It's slow paced but keeps you hooked. The performances are great. A great message.

100,coreyjdenford,The game is just about afoot,6,23 September 2020,"At this point ever since Sir Arthur Conan Doyle released his best selling novella of England's most famous fictional distinctive, there have been countless adaptations from stage to TV and even film, and each one no matter the budget seemed to be focused on the cases, but never about his life. We all know about his older brother Mycroft, the politician who likes to keep status in government untarnished. But it seems noone really knew of a sister, Enola which as Millie Bobby Brown points out in Netflix's Enola Holmes it spells alone backwards. And it seems like this could be the start of a franchise in waiting, if it was to succeed, in that case since its on Netflix that has to be up to the audience numbers. That may or not be difficult thanks to Brown's effervescent attitude towards the character, the 16 year-old English actress gives a brilliant performance bringing her character life in fact for effort it's an 11. But for everything else it seems that there could've been a lot more lighter in the story though thanks to Brown and Henry Cavill's more suave take on Sherlock Holmes and it's definitely a lighter tone than both of Guy Ritchie's takes. Director Harry Bradbeer makes this world enchanting to disappear into and in Enola, Brown seems to have found her crowning glory. Granted it succeeds in the embodiment of female power but lacks in its subtlety, thankfully other than that Enola Holmes and Brown offer a fine and fun adventure that needs more work done to it maybe if it does become a franchise, it can improve its standards along the way. It's also slightly too long. 3/5.",Enola Holmes
101,daisukereds,One of the best movies of the year?,7,25 September 2020,"...it's not saying much, I know. But stillThis is one of those rare films you can feel cozy in.
The characters, the world.. even the lighting, the background noises, the music. It is a perfectly constructed little story. Not much of a mystery (as you can see most everything from afar), but enough intrigue and adventure to make it entertaining. But what rises above it all is the interactions between the likeable characters (not you, Mycroft).It's an interesting idea, to have Sherlock as a background character looming about.. I've always enjoyed the idea of such a prominent persona not being the center of attention.. and Henry does a great job with it.The 2 leads are quite likeable as well. The cinematography, production and everything else is marvelous. One of Netflix best releases yet.
Highly recommended to anyone slightly interested.",Enola Holmes

It reminded me of the old Studio system whereupon she might be signed to Netflix :) Whatever the future may hold for her I think it will be bright. I think you need to be a young girl experiencing young girl things in a patriarchal world for this to make sense. As I'm not it was a bit uninteresting yet entirely watchable till the end. The period sense was lovely and never seemed forced, it was a very naturally set film in this way. All in all quite enjoyable and well worth watching. I think younger viewers, particularly teens of that age would identify very well with the character of Enola and the situation she found herself in.

103,W011y4m5,Mansplaining: The Movie.,8,30 September 2020,"One thing that increasingly irks me about Jack Thorne's scripts - despite this one's admitted strength - is the blatantly noticeable hypocrisy of them; so often within his screenplays, he clearly attempts to showcase enlightenment, championing the voices of the oppressed by depicting the struggles that they either currently do or have had to endure throughout history. Now this wouldn't be an issue if his actions were consistent with the words he puts out to the public but his inability to live by the same mantra is increasingly conspicuous with each & every new project which announces his involvement.It's all very fair & well saying to minorities ""your voices deserve to be heard & you should make them so"" but when you're the same straight white cis man who essentially talks over them by simultaneously writing pretty much every single British TV show & feature film within the UK creative industry, it has to be said how depriving minorities of the same opportunities to tell their stories - by harbouring them all for yourself & taking up multiple slots each year in a content provider's release schedule - is rather indefensible, when you think about it?This is the same man who ensured no undiscovered or emerging talent could partake in the scripting process for his most recent show (His Dark Materials) by insisting on writing each & every single episode solely by himself. He had 8 installments & not a single one of them was guest written. If he actually cared half as much about representation as he obviously would like us to think he does, he'd use his platform to amplify their voices instead of giving his fictional characters meaningless motivational speeches. Prioritise providing real individuals with the opportunities to prove their capabilities... That would matter more - but he doesn't. For instance, you want to champion the voices of women, as a man, why not just let a woman write the adaptation of Enola Holmes instead? That's recognising your privilege & allowing someone else the chance for a change. Put your money where your mouth is - otherwise your liberalism is simply hollow & performative.",Enola Holmes

Women are victims of men, males have all the power, and Enola is a super ninja that need no man(Kind of, she does like a guy) and skills that Bruce Lee would be envious of.Yeah...so Enola is Sherlock's sister or something and has a high IQ or something, and overcomes male oppression to solve a mystery that even Sherlock can't solve...why? Because we are all living in hell secretly. I actually has something to do with feminism and women having zero understanding of history.So I will say, the actress is very likeable and the terrible script and story was not really her doing. She did a good job I felt, but still, this story was poop. The themes are poop.I am not sure, at the time of writing, how something so poorly written has a 6.6 on IMDB.

The female empowerment in this movie is basically a mother not giving her daughter a proper education because that's a somehow a curveball to society.And it's not smart either. Most of ""riddles"" in this are just wordplay which any 10y/o could solve with some time.

Director: Harry Bradbeer
Starring: Millie Bobby Brown, Helena Bonham Carter, Sam Claflin, Henry Cavill, Louis partridge, Burn Gorman, Adeel Akhtar, Susan Wokoma, Frances De La Tour etcOverall rating 94/100Enola Holmes, Sherlock Homes little sister, discovers that her mother has gone missing, she must find clue in order to find her again. She must learn to become a lady and make new friends. Enola Holmes was fantastic and I had an absolute blast with it, there is so much good things to talk about so let's get started.First of all the movie had fantastic cinematography, charming tone and fantastic narration from Milly Bobby Brown. The movie had fantastic and unique cinematography and visual styles that worked really well with the tone of the movie, the set pieces were fantastic and reflected the time period as well. Also, the movie had such a charming and fun tone. The Movie had the charm you would expect from a sherlock movie, boosted by the fantastically charming performances and presentation of the movie was a perfect family pleaser. The narration from Millie Bobby Brown was also fantastic, in fact It was one of my favourite parts of the movie, it added to the movies charm, was absolutely hilarious and was helped by the fantastic execution by Millie, it also made the audience interact and engage with the movie a lot more, as well as developing the characters a lot better.My next few positives would be the humour, dialogue, performances and chemistry between characters. The movie was absolutely hilarious, the execution by the actors made it ten times better, but the movie incorporated it's humour into the dialogue so perfectly it worked excellently with loads of laugh out loud moments. The movies dialogue was also exceptionally clever, the dialogue was so excellently crafted and suited the particular cleverness of the sherlock characters, it was very witty and charming and excellently executed. The performances all round were great, everyone did a fantastic job here, but especially Henry Cavill, who played this kind of role perfectly, with heaps of charm and the type of acting he has perfected with the almost deadpan facial expressions and blunt humour. But the real star of the movie obviously has to be Millie Bobby Brown, wow she was just fantastic, and a real star in the making. She was charming and excting to watch, and she fitted the role and executed perfectly, I honestly don't think the character of Enola would have worked so well without her. All the characters had fantastic chemistry as well, making the characters really connect and gel with each other, and making all the relationships and friendships believable and fun to watch.My next few positives would be the set pieces, mystery, interesting relationships and great themes. I thought the set pieces were excellent and fitted the desired time period perfectly, with some beautiful set locations of the manors and the Holmes house. I also loved the mystery element to the movie. As expected with a sherlock linked movie Enola Holmes had to have a compelling and interesting mystery, and it had multiple excellently intertwined with each other and each as fun and interesting to watch unravel. I also thought that the relationships within the film was really interesting, the romantic relationship weren't generic and felt well earned and were actually interesting to watch develop the growing friendship/relationship between Enola and Sherlock was also great leading me to hope for a team up in the future. I also thought the films themes were great and well executed, the feminist themes weren't over the top and were very well executed, proving that women are capable of doing things independently without a man and are just as capable and the whole recurring theme of Enola standing for Alone was very clever as well.My only two slight negatives would be the rushed background and underused characters. I would say that I thought the movie rushed the background into Enola and her mums relationship at the beginning just slightly, I like what they did throughout the movie with their background, but it would have been nice to have a bit more time spent on developing their relationship so the impact of her mums disappearance is executed as well as it should be. I also thought personally that the character of Sherlock was underused, I completely understood why he wasn't used as much due to it being an Enola movie, but Henry Cavill had so much charm and fun with the role that it would have been nice if he was used more which hopefully he will be in the sequel.My final few positives would be the clever plot points, background linked to the main plot, plot twists and satisfying ending. I thought the movie really cleverly told a lot of its plot points with visual clews almost making the movie interactive and forcing you to pay attention to the characters surroundings which was brilliantly done, and should be used more in other films. I also liked the amount of background used for Enola and her mum and how much it linked to the main plot points of the movie. You could really tell how much Enola's mum influenced who she was and the decisions she made throughout the movie and it really made you connect with their relationship and Enola much better. The plot twists were also excellent, many I genuinely didn't see coming, which was fantastic as the movie constantly made me question what was going to happen and often didn't go for something generic or predictable which was refreshing to see. Finally the ending was very satisfying. They solidified the relationships, made good decisions with the characters and I felt satisfied with the amount of plot left open for a sequel.Overall, despite some characters needing to be used more. Enola Holmes is a fantastically crafted, visually pleasing, charming and fun thrill ride that is entertaining from start to finish and further solidifies the star power of all the cast especially Millie Bobby brown.",Enola Holmes
109,flingebunt,"Good teen story, but not worthy of the Holmes name",5,30 September 2020,"Enola Holmes is based on the conceit that Sherlock Holmes has a sister, who, like her brothers, has been raised to be a true intellect. So we get to see Sherlock and Mycroft, while also following the adventures of Enola.While the story is amusing enough, and while it teases that Enola will be every much the equal of Sherlock, the simple fact is that what you see is basic and simple clues that anyone could follow. What you get is something fun, good for teenage girls, but generally forgettable.",Enola Holmes
110,Donatien3,This Girl Feels at Holmes,9,27 September 2020,"There's been countless versions of the Sherlock Holmes story, including (recently) the Benedict Cumberbatch-led UK series, the American reboot ""Elementary"", and the two Robert Downey Jr movies.Based on a series of books called ""The Enola Holmes Mysteries"", ""Enola Holmes"" puts a unique twist on the old tale in a couple of ways: firstly, it has Sherlock's younger sister Enola (Millie Bobbie Brown) as the protagonist, with Sherlock (Henry Cavill) taking a backseat, along with his older brother Mycroft (Sam Claflin).Secondly, this movie is a Netflix exclusive. While that's mainly due to COVID-19, the direct-to-streaming distribution method indicates how popular - and convenient - the streaming services have become.Enola sets off to London to find her missing mother Eudoria (Helena Bonham Carter), but soon becomes entangled with the young Viscount Tewkesbury (Louis Partridge) and a plot surrounding the historic Reform Bill vote: the Representation of the People Act 1884.Enola proves to be strong-willed as her mother (with Bonham Carter mainly appearing in bite-sized flashbacks): Eudoria taught her to fight, be independent, and to use her brain, rather than being a 'proper lady' so she could find a well-to-do husband and bear children. She's also capable of blending into her environment, from dressing like a proper lady to a common newspaper boy. It's a refreshing twist on the classic Arthur Conan Doyle tale.Enola's not afraid to break the fourth wall either, directly addressing the camera to provide relevant backstory and pose questions to the viewer, like a real detective would. There's also some impressive visuals to mix up the 'show' and 'tell' narrative devices.Even if you think you've seen every Sherlock Holmes story, ""Enola Holmes"" will surprise you with its fresh take.",Enola Holmes

112,ginocox-206-336968,Self-indulgent feminist fantasy fulfillment with a healthy dose of misandry,4,4 October 2020,"Enola Holmes is about 60% self-indulgent feminist fantasy fulfillment, 20% buddy-pic/road-trip, 10% mystery, and 10% 1970s made-for-television-style action/adventure. Somewhere in there, they manage to set the groundwork for a sequel or franchise.The MacGuffin is an impending Parliamentary vote of critical import to the women's suffrage movement, the Representation of the People Act 1884, which was actually passed four years before the setting of the movie and didn't extend voting rights to women. Various villainous types are adamantly opposed to its passage, while a shadowy group of radical feminists seem prepared to go all Guy Fawkes for reasons and in a manner that are never made clear. Neither group has motives that make much sense. The opponents could have expressed concern that most women were not educated, or that few paid taxes, so shouldn't dictate how government revenues were allocated. Instead, they are portrayed as shallow misogynists intent on preserving the status quo by subjugating women. With such shallow villains, the protagonists seem equally vapid, insisting women's suffrage is the way of the future. The lord who will cast the deciding vote does so for no other reason than that his father would have done so.Enola Holmes joins a long procession of recent films that prioritize political pandering over plot and character development. Initially, the film seems to handle its socio-political message fairly adroitly, but it quickly devolves into a constant onslaught of feminist propaganda, delivered with a healthy measure of misandry. Sherlock (Henry Cavill) is given little to do and little of what he does drives the plot. Neither Sherlock nor Enola (Millie Bobby Brown) demonstrate brilliant powers of observation and deduction by weaving obscure clues into a convincing tapestry of irrefutable logic. Enola has read every book in a sizeable private library, including the encyclopædia, but never draws upon her supposedly vast knowledge of medicine, engineering, chemistry, physics or any other science. About all she does is solve anagrams, which in real life don't always have unique solutions, as with bowel/below, so seem of dubious value in detection or encryption.In many respects, Enola is a fairly typical heroic protagonist: A precocious intellectually-gifted Übermensch, privately tutored by a sensei with an unconventional approach to education, financially independent, adept at one or more forms of martial arts, et cetera. Her youth and gender consign her to a smaller, but hardly exclusive, group of amateur female sleuths. Enola hardly distinguishes herself by her deductive skill, which is barely displayed.There are two striking contrasts between Enola and, say, Modesty Blaise. First is her aggressive, relentless feminism, which seems to color nearly everything she says or does. Most heroes display a certain benevolence toward all victims, possibly with a Robin Hood-esque propensity. Enola is more narrow-minded and selfish, with a generous streak of misandry. When she realizes the marquess is in imminent peril, her first impulse is to throw him to the dogs to save her own skin. She takes no interest in him and his troubles until she realizes he could be helpful in achieving her own objectives.Second is Enola's physical appearance, which is the polar opposite of Monica Vitti as Modesty Blaise or Farrah Fawcett as Jill Munroe. She isn't ugly by any stretch of the imagination, but neither is she strikingly gorgeous. Her facial features are somewhat boyish, a trait she exploits on several occasions by disguising herself as a boy. Miss Harrison disparages her measurements as not being sufficiently feminine. Physically, she is what might be described as a chick-flick protagonist - attractive, but not so beautiful as to seem like competition to the soccer moms in the audience. She is a protagonist for an age when plus-size models adorn the cover of Sports Illustrated, swimsuit competitions are abandoned by beauty pageants, and a transsexual is chosen as Playboy's Playmate of the Month.But the film goes beyond casting a girl-next-door as the romantic lead, to a deliberate, almost aggressive rejections of traditional notions of femininity and masculinity. Her romantic lead is a baby-faced boy with long hair who is unattached and inexperienced, despite being one of the most eligible bachelors in England. When she catches him gazing at her in admiration, she admonishes him not to look at her. The closest they get to an impassioned embrace is exchanging looks through an iron gate, with him on the side representing power and influence, and her symbolically excluded. He can prepare a seven-course vegetarian feast from wild plants, but is oblivious to the palace intrigues that surround him.The writer and filmmakers could have taken a positive approach, with Enola and Sherlock each using their powers of observation and deduction to solve the mystery. They could have independently arrived at the same solution, showing that a woman can be just as effective as a man. Or, they each could have been stymied until they relied upon one another to solve the case together. Instead, the filmmakers embraced a much darker, more negative narrative.Women, other than those like Enola and her mother, are unable to succeed because they are exploited by men. At worst, men are insidious misogynistic villains intent on exploiting women; at best, useful idiots. Suffrage and feminism are seen as zero-sum games, rather than empowering women to achieve more - giving women a larger share of an existing pie, rather than enabling them to make the pie larger. The purpose is not to improve attitudes, or to provide the educational opportunities that will enable women to achieve their full potential, but to seize power through legislation, or, if necessary, violently.Feminists are critical of toxic masculinity, but this film has strong undercurrents of toxic feminist attitudes.",Enola Holmes

While it had some really good scenes and ideas flowing through it, overall it was a bit dull. I really liked the storyline of Lord Tewksbury and thought that should have been the main storyline rather than her finding her mother. That storyline for me never really took off. I see what they were trying to do, but they could have incorporated freedom and rights and such in a different way.

118,noahgibbobaker,"Generic, by the book and soulless.",4,24 September 2020,"This is the second thing I've seen Millie Bobby Brown in, the first was Drake's bed. Her performance must have been good as Drake nearly ruined his career to get with her, unfortunately her performance with drake did not translate to the screen well. Wow she made tears come out of her eyes. What a great actress. I don't understand why she is considered a good actress.I have a lot of problems with this film but the storytelling is the worst issue. The constant fourth wall breaking just to tell the audience what's going is really annoying and lazy. The ssf part about this is that there is so little effort but into telling the story visually that if Enola wasn't explaining everything directly to me I would have been lost. There is also flashbacks every ten minutes also just to show us why Enola is the genius she is. I almost feel bad for Harry Bradbeer for directing a movie with such a incomptitent screenplay written by Jack Thorne. I was surprised to find out he doesn't have any disabilities after hearing what came out of these characters mouths.There are a couple problems with the casting and a lot of bad acting. Henry Cavill and Louis Partridge have stupid faces so I couldn't take them seriously and that's not helped by what they have to say and do. Also there isn't one good performance, I guess not everyone is awful but no one is good either, everyone had at least one hilarious line reading, Milly Bobby Brown has about fifty.Not everything is bad though, the themes are great. The foundation of the film is that women don't have equal rights with men which is obviously ridiculous, this is presented in about the most heavy handed way possible but they are good themes nonetheless. Enola Holmes is technically awful either, it has awful moments in the technical department but it's mostly average, nothing special, nothing new.I wouldn't recommend this one; it's boring after about thirty minute until the credits roll.",Enola Holmes
119,thenolanfan,Review - Enola Holmes,5,27 September 2020,Faithful adaptation to a poorly written graphic novel.Apart from the feminism message which I thought was essential to the story and Millie Bobby Brown's performance in which she shows an acting range that I didn't expect.This movie disappointed me as much as Nancy Springer's story. It fails to capture even the most elementary aspect of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes.Closer to fan fiction than anything else.,Enola Holmes
120,pranayjalvi,Millie Bobby Brown solves a dull mystery in Netflix's disappointing Enola Holmes,5,23 September 2020,"Without much of a mystery to solve, this young Holmes comes across more like a junior-level Wonder Woman: intelligent and highly trained yet puzzled by this unfamiliar, unfair world of men.The movie was less intriguing with no high level mystery whatsoever.

121,TheCorniestLemur,Not bad except for Sam Claflin's mustache,6,6 January 2021,"I was not prepared to see Aunt Petunia slap Eleven.I was, however, somewhat impressed with this. Of course it's not a directorial tour de force or anything, and it does get maybe a little bit preachy and override the point of some scenes, and it kind of forgets about the main plotline in the second half, but for all that, you could certainly put on a whole lot worse for little girls.Millie Bobby Brown carries the film surprisingly well, so it's nice to see that her being so great in Stranger Things wasn't just a fluke, and her character is likable enough even if she isn't really all that interesting. Henry Cavill seems to have a talent for fitting surprisingly well in roles I never thought he would, like Geralt, but he's a pretty decent Sherlock as well.It's a nice looking film too, although it would have been nice if they had fully embraced the Victorian aesthetic instead of the whole of London looking a little bit too much like a set.I mean, it's exactly what I said it was earlier - it's a fine enough kids' film that won't make you want to grow Sam Claflin's awful mustache just so you can rip it out, but it's not really anything beyond that either.Also when I was texting my girlfriend to tell her I watched this it autocorrected to ""ebola holmes"" lol",Enola Holmes
122,akhil027,Decent movie.,7,1 February 2021,"It had a cliched but enjoyable first and second act but a really poor third act. I wished to see what happens with the mother and was left unsatisfied. It was so easy for me to predict who was the villain. It's probably because I've seen too many movies. But it would be great for any teenager who watch this.
Kudos to Millie Brown who delivered a great performance as Enola. She was so charming. I felt like the casting could've been better with some of the female characters.
Anyway, this is a perfect movie for teenagers and a pretty decent movie for adults. With little bit of better writing, this could've been perfect for adults too.",Enola Holmes
123,TheVictoriousV,Not bad for what it is. But it is indeed what it is.,6,28 September 2020,"Enola Holmes is the latest addition to the progressive vogue of revising an established fictional universe in such a way that ""actually, this Strong Female Character^tm was the most powerful, intelligent, and important being around this whole time"" - and yes, one could easily craft a female role model this formidable (struggles and humanizing traits optional) in a wholly original work, but it's easier to cash in on people's progressive values/feminism if you also have brand recognition and nostalgia. For what it is, it's not bad. But it is indeed what it is.In this case, the universe being tampered with is that of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, and to be fair, since Detective Holmes has already been adapted in all sorts of cringey ways throughout the past century, a fan-fic like this is far from the worst. I've read there even exists an Enola Holmes book series so you can't really chalk this one up to big, bad PC culture (in its modern form, anyhow).Millie Bobby Brown is nevertheless likable as Enola Holmes, sister of Sherlock, played here by Henry Cavill (who I find is at his best when not having to fake an American accent). The synopsis promises that, contrary to what we know of Sherlock and his status as the greatest detective of them all, Enola shall find ways to outsmart him.On top of Brown (often glancing at the camera à la Fleabag) and the empowerment delivered both by her and other characters with marginalized backgrounds (including Susan Wokama's character, who sneers at the privileged complacency of those who don't care about politics), the biggest draw of Enola Holmes seems to be newcomer Louis Partridge. That is, among the YA crowd.These types are nowadays found on Twitter, sharing interchangeable ""thirsty for Patridge"" memes that make me wonder if they're actual human beings (albeit programmed during youth into unconditional fandom and consumption) as opposed to publicity-drumming plants. If Twitter was as ubiquitous during the heyday of Twilight, you bet we would've seen something similar with low-res ""Team Edward"" images.Also to be drooled over is Sam Claflin as Mycroft, and the Holmes family matriarch is played by Helena Bonham Carter so I won't act like I'm much better than the average Netflix-stan Twitter account. That's me being humble.Despite its political themes, some of which are relevant to still ongoing struggles, I'd say the film works as a fun crime-solving romp. Young girls who watch it will feel empowered by the prospect that they, too, can be extraordinary detectives, but I don't think this will drag them into bigger conversations that may confuse them at their age (as might otherwise be the case when films for younger viewers aren't entirely subtle with these things, and I sincerely hope more radical parents don't try convincing them that wanting to join the Holmes family is equivalent to wanting a police job). They'll have fun watching it and then, as observed, share memes of the cute boys in it. Enjoy it while it lasts.For the older viewers, there are charming call-backs to the Doyle novels. These viewers will no doubt have questions, like I initially did, as to why we need to do fanfiction to inspire the kiddies instead of doing something new and fresh and leaving Doyle be.However, I don't think this plays as bitterly or resentfully as, say, The Predator and Ghostbusters 2016. It adds something cool to a fictional universe I was tired of anyway. My Sherlock is still the mouse, though.",Enola Holmes
124,ariqakbar,"its good, but it can be much better",6,3 January 2021,"This movie have a lot of potential actually. But, some stuff are just to much. like the way Enola talk to the camera. i mean, if u doing it for opening or just for several time along with the movie goes its fine but the entire movie? man come on? it become annoying. if that talk to camera can be in a good person, imagine how powerfull every-time enola scene side to side with her flashback with her mom.And then, i think everyone was expect another side of Sherlock Holmes Story. with stayed in ''detective'' vibe kind of film. i loss my interest more when i know it has a huge amount of romance in the storyline. but then again, its personal taste.Her relationship with his brother was another point to get this movie back to the grip. Slow but sure the mystery problem solving was make the movie sharp again.that cgi tho, come on?",Enola Holmes
125,carlos37andre,"Great cast, a lot of fun",7,28 September 2020,"Well, the movie is pretty cool. I like it has its own style, and it honestly feel differently from most of the Netflix original movies. Mostly the breaking of the forth wall I guess, gives the movie idk, a different feel from most of the movies out there, cause, well, I don't think is fair to say that breaking the fourth wall is something common, on movies in general.I like most of the rumor in it, it honestly feels a bit Wes Anderson-ish, with the camera style, and the dry humor at times, I liked it. The cast is also great, Millie Bobby Brown just steals the whole thing, and carries it on her shoulders, she's the heart and soul of the movie. But the supporting cast is also good! I wish we had gotten more of Henry Cavill's Sherlock! Cause his relationship with Enola I thought was pretty cute, and had a lot of potential, that's kind of not explored yet. Sam Claflin is good as Mycroft, I just felt a bit weird, that he's more of a jerk this time around, than in other versions of the character we had seemed before, still tho, he was good with the hole. Helena Bonham Carter is great here as well, with the few scenes she had, and well, overall, there wasn't a single actor I thought was bad here.About the plot tho, I like the whole mystery with the mom, and I was really invested in, but I truly thought things start to get a bit convoluted with the whole lord of Tewkesbury or something, for most of it, the two stories don't match at all, they keep jumping from one storyline to the other, and they sort of tie it up at the end, but, after just one viewing of the movie, I felt like the didn't quit wrapped up the mom's storyline. What were the bombs for after all? They sort of introduce that she is a revolutionary or something, she's apparently planning to bomb some place to... put pressure on the vote thing to pass, I guess? But at the end, is the dude's vote that makes it happen, and they don't really say anything else about what she's doing, and why exactly she did run away.And well, with that, I think the movie goes a bit longer than it should have, it loses some of its energy through the last 30ish minutes, and I truly think it would be a lot better if they had almost completely removed the whole lord storyline. Still, I had fun watching it, and if this is indeed a new franchise, I'm on board with another one.7,5/10",Enola Holmes
126,spasek,Pure Fun and Delight!,8,23 September 2020,"If you're looking for a fun film with mystery and intrigue that doesn't take itself too seriously, and provides a delightful escapist story, then you are sure to enjoy this movie.The performances across the board are stellar, but it's Millie Bobby Brown who really steals the limelight as the titled, ""Enola Holmes."" She certainly makes you cheer hard for Enola to solve the case but also to remain an independent young woman. You also have some great performances by Henry Cavill and Helena Bonham Carter to name a few.Enola is the sister of Sherlock Holmes, and their uptight, regimental older brother, Mycroft Holmes. Enola's only desire is to find her mother, who has gone missing. Mycroft's only desire is to put Enola in a finishing school.Enola sets off on her own, as a young and inexperienced 16-year-old girl, armed only with the knowledge that her mother has passed down to her: knowledge in history, chemistry, literature, and even physical combat. Enola is already blessed with keen deductive reasoning skills that make even Sherlock grin with pride.While the case sets Enola off in search of her mother, she quickly becomes side-tracked with a much more important case.Those insecure little boys who've complained that the film is too ""Feministic"" or ""not historically accurate"" are those who can't enjoy the story for what it is. The movie is NOT supposed to be based on history! And, yes, the movie is a strong take on the capabilities of women not being inferior to men. If you have a problem with either of these things, then don't watch it. I love emotional cowards who are unable to deal with the power of women. It always makes me laugh.I really hope they make another film, as this movie was very enjoyable, and one that the whole family can enjoy.",Enola Holmes
127,GomezAddams666,A worthy entry into the Holmes mythos,8,24 September 2020,"I am usually a very big fan of canon, specially when it comes to Sherlock Holmes, but even I have to admit this was a refreshing take on the famous sleuth.Millie Bobby Brown (Stranger Things) shines bright as Enola Holmes, the youngest sibling of this unusual family, as she is not only incredibly intelligent, but also charismatic and fierce, when her mother disappears and her older brother Mycroft is only interested in their family reputation, Enola sets out to solve a mystery that might have bigger implications for the future of England.Henry Cavill is very likable as Sherlock Holmes, which is unusual as Sherlock's latest portrayals have been closer to the source material, where he is rather unpleasant, but in this movie, the jerk of the family is Mycroft, who is portrayed incredibly insufferable.The movie itself is entertaining, fast paced, humorous, and it manages to create an ambiance of mystery that challenges the audience to race Enola and Sherlock to solve two puzzles at once, it also shows the range of Brown as a performer, as she is stepping into a big mythology but seems to fit in Victorian England effortlessly.",Enola Holmes
128,MarcoParzivalRocha,Fresh approach to Sir Doyle's world,7,27 September 2020,"Enola Holmes sets out to find her missing mother, while trying to get rid of her two brothers, Sherlock and Mycroft. It's not brilliant, but it is the fun, familiar and popular approach that Sir Doyle's universe needs to captivate new audiences, using some basic pillars of his style and adding new elements that work really well. The plot is nothing out of the hat, it has a particularly basic and linear structure so that it is easy to follow, but it has the right pace to entertain us from start to finish. Millie Bobby Brown is the star of the show, her role is the best part from this film, with her unique charisma and a dynamic that many hollywood actresses should study and replicate. It is an example of female empowerment, an attempt to change individual rights and social standards. I'm curious for a sequel in the near future.",Enola Holmes

131,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Fun and cute,7,30 September 2020,"It was quite a fun movie, but I think it would work a bit better as a series. It felt like they were trying to set too many things up. Now, they're likely hoping for a sequel where I would assume some of this stuff would be addressed. But again, I think it would have been better to draw it out over a series, or cut something out and introduce it later on. Some of the mysteries/conflicts felt a little rushed.I don't generally like narration in films. I find it usually a lazy way to get exposition across. But it actually didnt bug me that much in this. Especially Millie making faces at the camera, I think it added to her ""spunky"" nature. I think it could have been toned down a bit. Especially in scenes with other characters, cause there was 1 or maybe 2 times where I said ""Was she saying that to them, or was that for us"" and then of course when others wouldnt react to her comment I would be like ""Ok for us then"". And overall, let us figure out stuff too.If you're looking for a more serious and cerebral Holmes movie, I dont think this will be for you. This definitely is geared more towards teens/families. Which isnt a bad thing, I still thought it was fun. But to just to keep in mind.I thought all the actors did a really good job. Millie was the standout of course and was very likable throughout. Henry's Sherlock was a tad...boring. I felt like his character kind of took a backseat to the rest which on one hand kind of makes sense since he isnt the main character but also kind of weird since in this universe he is made out to be a super impressive famous guy, but we really dont see much as to why. But again, things to explore in a sequel. Louis Partridge (who kind of reminds me of a young Ben Barnes) was good with what was given, but I feel like he was thrown in there mainly to fill that teenage heartthrob quota.But if they do make a sequel, I would check it out. I really liked Millie Bobby Brown and I liked her character.",Enola Holmes
132,nidhunmoviebuff,Dull humour and an unintelligent mystery spoils a good performance from Millie Bobby Brown,6,24 September 2020,"#MovieReview #EnolaHolmes #Netflix #MillieBobbyBrown #HenryCavill #SpoilerFree #HollywoodThe weight of expectations when delving into the Holmes universe is what cripples Enola Holmes. As a standalone film it is above average, with Millie Bobby Brown infusing verve and energy into the character of an unconventional, tomboyish teenage detective, set out to find her missing mother in Victorian-era England.However, the films pales in the inevitable comparisons to Guy Ritchie's RDJ-lead Sherlock Homes movies and the cult Gatiss-Moffat series 'Sherlock' that featured Benedict Cumberbatch.The underlying mystery is simply not intelligent enough and the wit and humour director Harry Bradbeer tried to add to the narrative feels flat and uninventive.Henry Cavill is criminally underutilized in a performance that will leave you wondering what he was thinking opting for this role after the success of 'The Witcher'.A big let-down after a giving us a promising trailer and an interesting premise. Not recommended.",Enola Holmes

Do watch on Netflix and tell me your thoughts too! Pax, Murf",Enola Holmes
135,kingofdanerds,Great acting but not so great of a mystery,6,14 October 2020,"Well, when I had nothing else to do, I decided to take to Netflix to keep me busy and Enola Holmes was in the top movies. So, why not? Enola Holmes is a 2020 Netflix original (but was originally slated for a theatrical release but due to COVID 19 was put on Netflix). The film stars Millie Bobby Brown who is a fairly popular young actress who has starred in Stranger Things. She also produced this film which is even more extraordinary. Also Henry Cavill (as Sherlock Holmes) and Helena Bonham Carter. The film is based off of some books of which I have not read. The film got positive reviews from critics and audiences of which praised the performance Millie Bobby Brown.The film follows Enola Holmes who lives with her mother. Enola is the younger sister of Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes. One day, Enola's mother goes missing and Sherlock and Mycroft return home. Enola then goes into the care of Mycroft who is dissappointed with Enola and wants to enroll her in a school for girls. Enola runs away, not wanting to do what Mycroft wants, and meets Lord Tewksbury who is a young lord. The rest of the film follows Enola solving the mysteries surrounding her mother and this Lord Tewksbury.Well, for one, the critics were right about one thing. The acting from Millie Bobby Brown is really phenomenal. She is very talented in everything that I have seen her in (and to be honest Stranger Things is the only thing so far that I have seen her in). The acting all around is really good. Another thing I really like is the message here in this film. That being about oppression and feminism and also finding out who you are. I think that those themes were relevant back then and are most certainly relevant today. Those two things, the acting and the themes, are really the two strong points of this film and they really hold this film. But there are some negative things I have to say about this film. The first is more of a minor complaint when compared to the other criticism that I have. The first minor criticism is the fourth wall breaking. It happens way to often and gets really annoying. Fourth wall breaking can be done a clever ways. Take a look at Deadpool for instance. It was alright the first couple of times but after a while it got annoying. Most of the time Enola talks to the audience when she breaks this fourth wall. But there are times when she just glances. I just did not find it very clever and the film could have easily done without. Another minor complaint is that I somewhat wish Sherlock Holmes had a bigger part in the story. The big reason that I watched this film was for the fact that Sherlock Holmes was in this film. Granted, having more focus on Sherlock would definitely take away from Enola who is the star of the film. Also, this is Enola's mystery to solve and not Sherlock's. Which leads me to a major complaint that I seem to find common in some reviews. The mystery. First off all, there are two mysteries. One involving the disappearance of Enola's mother and the other being who is trying to kill Lord Tewksbury. Both mysteries are not very engaging. I have to keep talking about Sherlock Holmes but, Sherlock Holmes mysteries are supposed to be mysteries that work your mind and make you think really hard. These mysteries, do not. But, technically this is not a Sherlock Holmes mystery, this is an Enola Holmes mystery. The conclusions to these mysteries are very predictable and even the way Enola figures them out is by doing cryptograms or something. It is somewhat of a downer. The way I see it, Enola Holmes should be basically Sherlock Holmes but female. I guess a good example would be James Bond Jr. who is basically James Bond, but little. Hopefully that makes sense in what I am trying to describe here....Enola Holmes has some truly fantastic acting and great themes that are fairly relevant but I found myself dissapointed by the lack of mystery surrounding these mysteries. Though I do believe some people would actually get more out of this film that I myself did.",Enola Holmes
136,aprilsfriendorin,"Not exactly what's advertised, but a fun movie nonetheless",7,6 November 2020,"So at first glance, I assumed this movie was about a mystery (centered around Sherlock Holmes' younger sister). It's not really about the mystery--in fact, the actual ""mystery"" element of the story itself was rather half-baked and disappointing. However, as an adventure movie, this was really good. It's entertaining, exciting, the acting is great, and there are some great feminist messages interwoven in without dominating the movie. It's a fun film and I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to watch an adventure movie. If you're looking for a full on mystery or don't care for films centered around kids/teens, then obviously this isn't for you.Also, bonus- for Harry Potter fans, there are quite a few Harry Potter actors in here.",Enola Holmes
137,swordsnare,The Enola Holmes Mysteries,6,26 September 2020,"Yes, there seems to be an apparent feminist message to this film. Once you get past some of these references, I found Millie Bobby Brown to be quite the competent and engaging young actress. As opposed to her usual role on Stranger Things, which is quite subdued in contrast.The production and costume design was good, but the storyline seemed a little detached from each of the characters involved. Henry Cavill as Sherlock was very much in the background of this film. I had wished there was more of a connection between Enola and Sherlock, other than the sharing of a surname.I'm not familiar with book series, but this film is probably more for the young adults in the end.

The film couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a thrill a minute movie or a comedy. I found it was more of a comedy than anything which ruined any tension the film had.
As another reviewer has stated there are to many metoo movement films that are being made, it's not a bad thing but let's make a good film first before jumping on bandwagons.
Overall it was enjoyable but don't believe the hype that it's a brilliant film, it's not.

141,hunter-friesen,"""Enola Holmes"" is clever fun",7,27 September 2020,"Over the years we've heard a lot of stories about the famed detective Sherlock Holmes. In fact, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's deerstalker wearing sleuth holds the record for the most portrayals of a literary character at 254.While Sherlock has dominated the mystery genre for over a century, a new part of the Holmes family is finally getting their due. The newest Netflix movie (there seems to be a new one every day) follows the adventures of the younger sister of Sherlock and Mycroft, named Enola Holmes.Enola was born years after her famous brothers and never quite got to know them or her prematurely deceased father. She spent her entire childhood with only her mother as company. Together, they read books, played indoor sports, conducted science experiments, and acted out plays. Despite her name being ""alone"" spelled backward, Enola always had her mother by her side to show her the wonders of the world.On her sixteenth birthday, Enola wakes up to the unpleasant surprise of her mother suddenly disappearing without a word. She calls in her brothers to help solve the mystery. They arrive with dismay about how Enola has been raised and cast her aside thinking she won't be of much aid. Needing to prove to her brothers that she's a capable young woman, Enola sets out to find her mother and beat them at their own game.Like the locomotive train that contains one of the movie's great set pieces, ""Enola Holmes"" is a well-oiled machine that runs at a rapid pace. The film carries an infectiously rambunctious energy to it, much of which comes from its star.Already a two-time Emmy nominee for her role as Eleven in ""Stranger Things"", Millie Bobby Brown is perfectly cast as our titular character. She never misses a beat with her comedic timing and carries the film almost solely on her shoulders. She also brings great skill to the emotional moments.Director Harry Bradbeer also contributes to the gleeful tone by doing what he does best. Similar to his work in the critically acclaimed ""Fleabag"", Bradbeer has his heroine break the fourth wall and talk directly into the camera. It's a fun tactic that never wears its welcome and allows for Brown to showcase her amazing talent.Things take a surprisingly dark turn once Enola arrives in London as she gets tangled with hitmen and a radical plot to bomb the House of Lords. For a supposed kids film, there is quite a bit of violence towards our younger characters.The home of Big Ben looks more drab and crowded than ever as cinematographer Giles Nuttgens beautifully contrasts the cramped and intimidating metropolis with the lush and vibrant countryside.What does bring down ""Enola Holmes"" from time to time is its predictable central mystery. If you're a veteran of Sherlock Holmes or the mystery genre, it won't be too hard to figure out what will happen next. The film also tries to weave in bits of social commentary about gender and class throughout. Unfortunately, the messaging is half-baked and creates jarring breaks from the whimsical tone.Even though Brown is clearly the star, the well-rounded supporting cast also shines in their roles.Superman himself Henry Cavill plays the iconic detective. Still with his Man of Steel physique, Cavill plays Sherlock closer to James Bond as his suave charisma brings a welcome departure from his dour performances in the DC films.Sam Claflin, most famous for playing Finnick in ""The Hunger Games"" films, is downright dastardly as the uptight Mycroft Holmes. Complete with a twirling mustache and tophat, Claflin offers a harsh counterbalance to Brown's exuberance.Finally, Helena Bonham Carter is inspirational as the eccentric mother of the Holmes trio. She brings the same out-of-the-box energy one would expect from her and hits the emotional depths required.With a star-making performance from its leading lady and a healthy dose of energy, ""Enola Holmes"" is a charming mystery for (nearly) all ages. Based on the way it ends, a sequel could be on its way in the near future; one that would be well deserved.",Enola Holmes

However not here, and if it wasn't for Sherlock or Mycroft, this would definitely be more than 5, maybe 7 or 8.Let me come to the point of what i liked in here. A benign attempt of Enola showcased as Sherlock's little sister who use her own intellectuals to solve a mystery, or rather taken up by herself. Then the atmosphere and sets, they were good and portrayed of earlier British era, maybe with some goofs but digestable. And ofcourse, Millie's acting was appreciable. The other star cast had limited time with camera, and they were also ok.Now the drawbacks. When you are playing with a character legend, and when it is Sherlock, give time and patience, and worth homage to it. This one, frankly, Sherlock's deduction felt naive and forcefed, and just so that his sister can overseed him. Mycroft is never so arrogant or cunning, and he too have great deduction skills. Its all wrong shown here. Again, coming back to story, if you need to showcase a love angle, show it in a proper way. Otherwise, if you want to stick to mystery, show it out loud and with ample clues so that the viewer can understand whats told. Enola finds a place with dynamites and all, I really didn't get that was it a filler or actually had some purpose in story. She is in search of her mother who is gone. Oh really and that was prime motive of the whole film. And the way she begun her search journey was also amazing. But then, just because the story had to end, it ended in a naive way. Like it started like a Sherlock way and ended as any dumb private detective who can solve cases. REALLY!!!Well, a one time watch and definitely not for Sherlock Holmes fans.",Enola Holmes

146,daniellawson-14-787057,"Feminist propaganda, with great moments",6,29 September 2020,"POSITIVES:1) The moments where the film actually gets dark and serious are fantastic, for example Mycroft and Enola's carriage ride, but far far far too brief
2) The 4 lead performances are great, Cavill as Sherlock in particular was a surprising delight and the scenes where he actually gets to show Sherlock's deductive powers are the best in the film
3) The family struggle between the Holmes siblings was very engaging and relatively true to form for a Holmes fan like myselfNEGATIVES:1) The feminist message behind the film is so on the nose that if they'd just had a screen saying ""feminism is great"" for 2 hours 3 minutes it would have been just as obvious
2) The film is all over the place in terms of its mismatch of genres: detective mystery, feminist propaganda, family drama, teen romance, comedy. All of these clashing genres makes the film so inconsistent and frankly frustrating
3) The film seems to very subtly brush over the fact that the mother was going to bomb the Houses of Parliament???
4) Seeing the annoying Viscount boy get shot at point blank range with a shotgun but then survive was so infuriating and completely ruined what could have actually been a powerful moment
5) It was so frustratingly ironic that Enola draws Mycroft as a caricature because the film portrays Mycroft as a complete caricature of a person, despite the depth and layers that the character actually has in the source material
6) As far as I'm concerned, the entire feminist message of the film suffers massively from the fact that Enola is constantly completely smitten for the good looking Viscount. The film essentially ends up telling the story of how women will always bend over backwards for good looking men. If this isn't the case, why did the Viscount have to be so good looking? Why couldn't he be 20 stone and ugly?",Enola Holmes

We saw her giving awesome performance in Stranger things and she rocked! But this movie badly needed two things, better script(read shorter) and/or shorter length. The film drags in at least 3-4 parts when it didn't need to and I yawned at least thrice during the movie which told me that it was not gripping enough in those draggy parts. If you shorten this by 20-25 mins it makes for a thrill ride, seriously!! That is how Much script/editing make A huge difference!!",Enola Holmes
150,skullhead739,Good but could have been much better,6,29 September 2020,"First off I see lots of reviews saying who this movie is for. Every single movie has a major demographic and this imo should have been a very diverse movie and falls short in its genre which is why I think this has equal amounts of good and bad reviews.The movie as a whole was good but also very mediocre. The plot was basic and some scenes were very cheesy and cliche but not in a good way. This movie tries to push a meaning of a young girl finding out who she is and gaining strength along the way (so pretty much a coming of age). But unlike most coming of ages that are funny, genuine and somewhat realistic. This isn't relatable at all. Its too cheesy and cliche that it becomes so odd because its trying to push a serious idea but made in such a crap goofy way that tries way too hard to appeal to everyone and ends up appealing to no one.The acting was only okay because the scenes were all pretty cheesy so not much can be expected. The characters were interesting and wholesome enough. The cast is pretty great filled with A-listers and is actually a very redeeming factor for this film.The old timey nature of this film is also pretty cool to see and I appreciated the sherlock Holmes aspect. The end of this film was very typical and cheesy which sucked but it wasn't too bad.Overall I would only suggest this movie if your bored as hell and if you have Netflix. Otherwise I'd give it a skip because there are 100 better coming of age movies out there let alone 19th century era films.",Enola Holmes

153,MovieBuff11732,A Movie That Didn't Have To Be Made,6,11 November 2020,"Enola Holmes is a Netflix Original that came out of nowhere. I don't know why it is here but it is. Just like most movies now.Enola Holmes is about Enola's mom (Helena Bonham Carter) going missing. Enola (Millie Bobby Brown) wants to go find her mother but her two brothers, Mycroft (Sam Clafin) and Sherlock (Henry Cavill) send her to boarding school while they go look for their mom. Enola then escapes the boarding school and meets a young boy named Tewksbury (Louis Partridge) and they go on an adventure to find Enola's mom and stay out of trouble.I don't know why this film was made. There was no reason. As far as I know, nobody wanted it to be made either. I am not a Sherlock Holmes fan at all. I know almost nothing about him and haven't really liked the previous movie adaptions in the series either. I watched this because it was a new film that came out in the year where there is a draught of new films. I never really found this film that interesting though. I thought it looked okay and coming out of the movie, I felt like it was okay. The story wasn't bad. You never really cared about the mystery that they had going on which is normally a big thing in a film like this. Enola was an interesting character though. She was something you don't really see in the time this film took place. That is why I found her interesting. It was fun to see her absorb the way everybody else does things. Most of the other characters didn't really have much background. Tewkesbury, which is a hysterical name, didn't really have much besides the fact he ran away from his family. The story wasn't impossible to watch but there are many scenes that dragged. Those are what took away from the film. The story for the most part was good but there were problems with it.This film had some of the better acting in the year though. Millie Bobby Brown who has really only been in the film Godzilla King Of The Monsters played the lead. She did marvelous. This is probably a film to start a solid career of acting. Henry Cavill didn't have that much to do but he was in it and he filled his time really well. He ate up the scenes that he was in. Sam Clafin sort of played the role of the villain. He wasn't completely the villain but he did some things that made you think he was. He didn't do bad but he did nothing out of the ordinary. Louis Partridge as Tewkesbury did the best with what he was given. As I said earlier he wasn't really given much to work with. Overall, the acting was pretty well and was the best part of the film by far.Enola Holmes is a fun film that had some marvelous acting but the story kept yanking it back from being one of the years better films. I would recommend this film to people who like the franchise or younger girls maybe.",Enola Holmes

Neither Sherlock nor Mycroft recognize their little sister when they reach the station. This is Sherlock Holmes who can tell you what you had for breakfast last week and Mycroft whose genius surpasses that of Sherlock can't tell who their sister is? I'm not buying it. If they wanted to make Enola the hero then fine but at least don't distract the audience by directly talking to them, winking, or explaining everything. Almost all the attention is placed upon Enola, and they still drop the ball in character building. The Holmes brothers are useless and it is quite obvious that Mycroft has a secret (yet not so secret) love interest for the abusive teacher Miss Harrison. In spite of what the writers want you to think, Enola Holmes just isn't Sherlock Holmes. The storytelling is mediocre at best and the sheer amount of unnecessary scenes is staggering that most of it doesn't make logical sense. The fight scenes are comical and the villain who fights Enola is so one dimensional. Enola is obviously intelligent and possesses a vast amount of knowledge, but in the end, she didn't solve the case. She didn't solve anything without Sherlock's help and yet she gets the credit.",Enola Holmes

160,hoernkeem,"Enola Holmes (2020, Harry Bradbeer) Good role for Brown in what could be a franchise if the plot can come together better",7,5 March 2021,"Enola Holmes (2020, Harry Bradbeer)
There have been so many recent stories and adaptations of the renowned Sherlock Holmes from Robert Downey Jr.'s film version to the Johnny Lee Miller American television version to the Benedict Cumberbatch British television version. Is there any more mining of this character we can do? To that end we point the camera at not Holmes himself but family members who share the same tenacious detective gene. Based on a series of books by Nancy Springer this film brings to the forefront the youngest sister of famous master detective Sherlock Holmes. I am uncertain if in the mythology he actually has a sister or if this is just some expanded scope to give a fresh take on essentially what is a YA detective story. The cast of this Netflix film is phenomenal including Millie Bobby Brown, of 'Stranger Things' fame, in the lead role and Helena Bonham Carter as her mother with Henry Cavill and Sam Clafin taking up the roles of Sherlock and Mycroft.
We start with Enola as a precocious, intelligent young person who is raised in a somewhat sheltered off the grid fashion by her mother Eudoria. Due to her upbringing she bucks most of the gender roles and popular trends of the time becoming essentially a modern heroine in Victorian England. The game is afoot when her mother mysteriously goes missing and Enola sets out to find her which launches her on a grand adventure and spirals into a tangential mystery involving a young Lord Tewkesbury. While following Enola on her adventure was quite entertaining I thought the ultimate mysteries surrounding her mother and Tewkesbury were weak. The mother storyline which prompted the entire thing is downright head scratching in my estimation. The Tewkesbury storyline not as much but just a bit bland for what you hope for out of a Holmes mystery even if the Holmes in question is but a teenage girl.
I quite enjoyed the direction and Brown as Enola is excellent. They consistently had her breaking the fourth wall and talking to the camera which gave them a fun little tool to work with as well effectively communicating Enola's intelligence, humor and playfulness. It worked well for laying out her analytical thought process which is the hallmark of any story with a Holmes in it. This is an entertaining enough film and enjoyable for what it is. The cast is amazing especially Brown in the lead role. I wouldn't mind seeing additional Enola Holmes films made hopefully with a plot more worthy of the assembled acting talent.

The film is quite awful, but it hits all the feminist notes that are required in Hollywood. It may even win an Oscar.If you are a normal person, than this film will likely be very boring, except for Millie's performances. It's an attempt to capitalize on the Sherlock Holmes name, while making a diehard, Feminist, diatribe.

Look for a headline ""Women voted 75 years before they were legally allowed to"" (which is a lie itself because most men couldn't vote when these women could ... back in 1843). Some women ran a chain of butcheries, hotels, cleaning businesses, etc. See the actual records for yourself (that is, for anyone who isn't a misandrist).So why revise history, when I can measurably demonstrate these ""girl power"" types can't even do the most basic of fact checking? Is it lasiness, or just another lonely ""girl power"" activist?If you love victimhood and want to re-write history, this is your film. Brown's performance is the usual woke ""i'm perfect, except i'm oppressed"".If you're not into victimhood, you're better off watching Anne of Greengables or Pippi Longstocking ... historical stories about some great women (rest assured, if you're one of these ""girl power"" types, you'll have NO IDEA about these girls because ... it doesn't match their permitted reading).Victimhood in 2020 is such a huge market.

Millie Bobbie Brown is a very talented actress and I'm excited to see where her career goes from here and she is easily the best part of this film. She brings a lot of energy to the role and while her 4th wall breaking and script she is given may not be good, she's still trying. Henry Cavill also does a pretty good job here too and I wish we got to see more of his take on Sherlock Holmes. The film is well shot but it doesn't do anything creative with its shots and the production design, costume design, and score are all pretty good. Everything else however was definitely below average. The plot is fast which is nice but certain elements of the story are not engaging at points. The setups and pay offs are so predictable that you could see them coming from a mile away. The editing is very dull and rapid and there are some very obvious green screen moments here and there. I took a lot of issue with the 4th wall breaks. It felt out of place and awkward at many points and really ground the film to a halt when it happened. I know they need to explain some elements but it could have been done much better than that. Go check this out on Netflix if you are a fan of Millie Bobbie Brown or Henry Cavill or if you enjoy the universe of Sherlock Holmes. If you don't like any of those elements, then you can definitely pass on this.",Enola Holmes

173,joshbarton15,Mystery runs in the family.,7,23 September 2020,"Thought this was going to be one hell of an annoying film from the fourth wall breaking opening that introduces us to Millie Bobby Brown's Enola Holmes, the little sister of Sherlock and Mycroft. Thankfully, the film goes the other way entirely to become a thoroughly entertaining mystery adventure romp that focuses on the lesser known member of the Holmes family. Millie Bobby Brown leads the film with a confidence you'd expect from someone who became so famous from Stranger Things, holding her own against the likes of Helena Bonham Carter, Sam Claflin and Henry Cavill in her first lead role. I'm sure Netflix have their sights set on future films or even spin-offs and, with how entertaining this turned out, I would gladly watch them.",Enola Holmes

This is then set against the backdrop of a sherlock homes esq mystery film. It did the female empowerment thing on point, really, stunning performance on that front. However, given that this was supposed to be more a mystery film, I did not expect this film to touch so little on that. There was a huge emphasis on Enola's struggles but it failed to make it relavent to the main storyline, even overshadowing it. Hence all I'll say is that if you're looking to watch a female empowerment film, this would be the one, but if you were like me looking to find the thrill of the mystery, keeping yourself at the edge of your seat to see the mystery solved, you will find yourself sorely disappointed.On that note, I will add that the acting and performance by the actors and actresses, especially millie, was most definitely a pleasant to watch.",Enola Holmes

If you want to build a feminist film, then do it the right way. Develop a smart plot, demonstrate the issues at hand and let the viewers draw the interpretation themselves.

177,maanikroda,Pithy light steps.,6,25 September 2020,"Enola Holmes isn't a carbon copy of the different versions of Sherlock Holmes we've seen in the movies & series, but it boasts the same pithy, modernized light step. It may not be quite as visibly bold as them, but screenwriter Jack Thorne and director Harry Bradbeer did a wonderful job of capturing that same thinking-out-loud visual aesthetic that turns exposition into more of a snack than a chore. Both Enola Holmes and its rising young star, Stranger Things' Millie Bobby Brown, effortlessly radiate charm in a tale about Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes' rebellious teen sister, a gifted super-sleuth in search of her missing mother. Millie; who already has become world's favorite, takes the entire movie on her shoulders effortlessly and while other cast members don't have a lot to do, they all seem to have done their jobs perfectly including the flawless Henry Cavill who portrayed Sherlock Holmes & many other cast members whom we've seen in Harry Potter movies including Helena Bonham Carter & Fiona Shaw.In the era of intellectual property in which studios are mining their own libraries to repackage the same branded concepts over and over, I found myself unexpectedly enjoying Enola Holmes despite our increasing cultural exhaustion with the property. The fourth-wall-breaking asides become tiresome at a point and the mystery isn't quite as fetching as the film thinks it is (nor is the puppy love romantic dynamic sprinkled throughout). But the movie stands tall when its major lead; ENOLA played by Millie Bobby Brown denounces her provincial older brothers by accurately pointing out that they don't wish to change the world because the world suits them as is.

I hate the first type of movie. It is meant for teens and not a broad audience. Better watch a disney classic instead if I had to. I should have given one more star for the production design and depiction of late 19th century, but I would have taken it out due to the politically correct with today's standards melting pot shown.
I didn't like the out of focus plot with its misdirection and holes. The joyful music and Enola's dialogue with the viewer, only emphasises the pretentiousness of the direction, even if the novel on which is based was like that - which I don't care consulting.
Henry Cavill is the only star in this ranking. Just give him James Bond's role immediately, to use his time and charisma more meaningfully than appearing as second guest in such messes.Overall conclusion: If you are not 10 years old girl, avoid.

But hold on, this one actually is pretty good. Though the acting of the lead does at times approach over-doing it, young viewers not familiar with the finer skills of the art will get the message effectively.There is actually a story, an adventure to be had, and as an older viewer I was interested to see how things would go. Is there content announcing the expected ""Only women can save the everything!"". Well, a little bit, but it's well balanced with the complexities and limitations of real life, and especially those you'd expect to find in a sixteen year-old adventurer let loose in the big world for the first time. There are no violently radical feminists in this story, just assertive women living their own choices in a generally hostile world.Enola Holmes is one of the few movies that could legitimately and effectively carry over into a sequel.",Enola Holmes
196,motrous,Enola Holmes,7,17 May 2021,"Good movie, though the classic depiction of Sherlock and Mycroft seem to be altered here. I think what they may have been going for was having them be more grounded in reality instead of having super hero intellects. But Enola is the main character and Brown does a good job playing the character. It's a fun young romance/detective story. My one main gripe was that she addresses the audience. That works in some movies but here it felt out of place.",Enola Holmes
197,chrisrowexxx,"Feel good movie, charming and great setting.",7,27 September 2020,"I can only score it for what it is , it's not much of a plot, quite dialogue heavy, often relying on amazing settings to distract you from what can feel a long film with many periods of not much happening. It was nicely put together , interesting that MBB got a producer credit, wonder how much she did or if it was an incentive to sign on. I have to admit I felt this was written with her in mind. The rest of the cast were fine, some quirky characters but mostly just plain stereotypes with a slightly more cartoonish quality.The mom steals a living, the amount of beginning and end films I've seen her do where she's far more absent than present is so odd. Didn't think this was one of her better roles, without the cooky stuff I don't find her to be a very good performer. Think I got used to Tim burton versions. The brothers were fine, the villains and accomplices were decent, nothing special but nothing bad. Scenery was awesome.Only two gripes is yet another woman good men bad vibe. Hopefully when people learn equality means to treat the same not one good one bad in either variation, the world will be far better.I'm going to be honest as she was in it, I loved stranger things, thought she was phenomenal in that, such a talent, loved her in this her comic timing was great, however I feel this was made with her in mind and if it'd have been anyone else I feel not only less interest but I reckon I'd have scored it 4. I enjoyed seeing someone I like in a new setting which helps, there's a lot of love for her and rightly so but being honest if you took her out for anyone this would've been, boring, too long, weak storyline and just another bang average film.",Enola Holmes

Hollywood rewards talent and I discovered she now earns $350K per episode on her five year TV Series, Stranger Things. Another $1M for Godzilla, $3M for the Godzilla v Kong sequel and over $6M for Enola Holmes! Pretty darn impressive for a 16 yr old (her mom still buys her clothes so they are age appropriate - lol.) Who knows what she's capable of in the future. The next Julia Roberts?As for Enola Holmes I thought it was cute, funny and Millie stole every scene that she was in. Such a great (natural) talent and I look forward to her next on screen venture. Nice to also see a depiction of Edwardian London and how the Suffragette movement got the vote.

It was written for young adults.Now this is the first one which was taken up by Netflix. There is a another one Enola Holmes 2 in the making.This is a mystery based on Elona Holmes missing mother, and the story is entangled with other things, politics, sufragents, murder, intrigue you name it. I watched for just over 2 hours and was just taken in by it all.Its fun, fast paced, the actress who plays the lead Millie Brown is a brilliant actress just loved her in the casting. I enjoyed the bit of love story too, and boo hoo who would have thought Frances de la Tour would be a villan lol.Just watch it with no sherlock expectations it has nothing to do with him, at all. Doesnt matter who plays him i never really noticed him.Ju Jitsu was very popular in victorian times. The Japanese wrestling technique was very popular with society ladies, as it was considered a sport which improved a lady's grace and was a practical method of self-defense.

202,KathleenK22,Great acting and story,9,24 September 2020,Oh my goodness some reviews decided what the movie should be and then rated it because it was not. Have they ever written a story or made a movie? Did this movie say it would be historically accurate or be anything but a piece of fiction. The main character is superb with brilliant acting and lovely to look at. For her tender age she is especially amazing! I really enjoyed the movie and was surprised at the low score. Maybe as more people of intelligence watch it the score will rise. Every age has people before their time inhabit it. How asinine to think that girls are only capable of sewing and breeding. There would have been many who knew they were more and fought for that. The budding romance is sweet as well. It is a family movie which is another bonus. Leading actors filled the roles so nothing shabby about that either. It is smooth and funny and thought provoking and an all round good film for the entire family or to watch by yourself. Others with me loved it as well.,Enola Holmes
203,richarddillomes,"Come for the story, stay for the cast.",7,30 November 2020,"Enola Holmes is about the younger Holmes sister portrayed by Millie Bobby Brown (Stranger Things) as she goes on a mission to look for her mother who disappears right on her 16th birthday. She receives a gift that sends her on a quest, along the way bumping into a boy that needs her help. Will she finish her mission, or will she get distracted?Brown is very charming as Enola, although there are times when you can tell she's acting through a scene. Not that she's not capable, maybe she did not get the push she needed from the director because she's also one of the producers? Sam Claflin (Charlie's Angels 2019, yeah any excuse to promote the movie) made the most of the role he's given and Henry Cavill (The Witcher) was criminally underused, and the only explanation I can think of is there will be a sequel and expanded screen time. Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Holmes was a delight to watch. Come to think of it, you cast Carter not because you need her to fill a role, you cast her because you need a Helena Bonham Carter in your movie.The movie is entertaining enough, although they could've shortened the 2-hour runtime a bit. There were scenes they could've done away with because they did not necessarily move the story along. Maybe I'm being hypercritical because I just recently watched the Sherlock UK TV series and Cumberbatch, Freeman, and the rest of the crew really upped the ante in terms of portraying the world's foremost super sleuths. I also found Enola addressing the audience excessive and distracting, but I'd like to give the benefit of the doubt that they're trying something new and it's not due to lazy writing.",Enola Holmes
204,GavWaskett,"Holmes: ""Is that comforter on your bed?"" Watson: ""No, sheet, Sherlock""",8,9 October 2020,"A Netflix film starring the ever-rising star of Millie Bobbie Brown and the reliable and talented pair of Henry Cavill and Sam Claflin. What could go wrong?Honestly, nothing - it is a thoroughly enjoyable film. It's not going to tax your brain, it's not going to worry you and scare you, it's a fun, who dun it, starring some very talented and likeable actors, well-written, sometimes amusing, some adventure, some mystery, it has got a Saturday evening written all over it! Sit down with a bag of Minstrels (or chocolate of your choice), a nice cup of tea or Cream Soda and Ice Cream (sorry going back to my childhood treat there!) and just enjoy the film.Millie Bobby Brown plays the lesser known Holmes - Enola, younger sister of Sherlock and Mycroft who embarks on a mission to find something important to her that's gone missing, whilst avoiding her guardian Mycroft, the more arrogant and less caring elder brother - played brilliantly by the normally likable Mr Claflin and trying to emulate her slightly Superman looking but more caring and definitely elementary pointing out brother Sherlock - Mr Cavill, showing his more tender older brother side whilst maintaining Sherlock's dignity and sensibleness.Along the way, she meets the young Viscount Tewkesbury, who has problems of his own, namely in the form of Burn Gorman's Linthorn - seriously it seems that if you ever need a hard-eyed bad guy, who is silently threatening then Burn Gorman is there to get to the job - he does these roles incredibly well, his family who are out looking for him, including Frances de la Tour as his Dowager (I can't help but think of Maggie Smith every time I hear the word Dowager now - Downton has a lot to answer for!) Grandmother and Fiona Shaw as Miss Harrison, who is blatantly the much more horrid ancestor of her character in Three Men and Little Lady.Millie Bobby Brown is superb and it is amazing that someone of her talent and screen presence is still only 16 and even more amazing is that I didn't know that she is British - she did such a great accent, I had to look it up and was surprised to find the reason she does such a great British accent is that she has British parents, even though she has moved around a fair bit. There are times during the film when Enola either makes little comments to or looks at the audience and from some actresses that could be annoying but she imbues it with a sense of charm and humour. This is one young lady with a huge, huge future ahead of her and well-deserved so far!It sets itself up nicely for a second film and both Miss Brown and director Harry Bradbeer both want to make a second one, I can only hope Netflix green lights it - though they can make odd decisions - cancelling The Dark Crystal series anyone!Sit down this weekend, crack open the chocolates and 1980's style drinks and sit back and watch Sherlock's lesser known sister take centre stage - was this a resounding success - No ship Sherlock it was (sorry couldn't resist - I nearly made it to the end though)(writing ship really reminds me of Die Hard's yippee ki yay kimosabe and I'm kind of disappointed with my self-editing - but had to be done as this is a family friendly blog!Oh yeah a really fun and enjoyable 16/20 from me - even Shell enjoyed it, so you know it's got to be good.",Enola Holmes

211,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,Great For Teenagers Looking For A Cool Literary Heroine; Sherlock Purists May Struggle.,6,27 September 2020,"Based on the young adult novel series by Nancy Springer, Enola Holmes borrows from Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes canon but uses this newly-invented character Enola Holmes, a 16-year-old girl in the Victorian era, as its central protagonist to give female teenage readers a new literary heroine. The film adaptation works on those merits, in a similar vein to last year's Little Women from Greta Gerwig, as a revisionist feminist adaptation of a literary classic for teenagers.Coming in as a Sherlock Holmes fan, it takes a while to digest the Enola Holmes' characterization of Sherlock and Mycroft as a new addition to the ongoing canon of Sherlock Holmes onscreen interpretations. They've been rewritten here to support a new female character in their own mythology and their more mythic elements are downplayed. Sherlock Holmes purists may have a big lump to swallow ahead of them and it may not sit well with them.Henry Cavill is the most normal well-adjusted onscreen incarnation of Sherlock Holmes. There's no obsessiveness or craziness or cursedness within his mind. Sherlock's self-invented profession seems like a normal everyday working man career path. Still relatively in his Superman physique, it never seems like he starves himself until the case is closed.There's one scene where Sherlock goes to speak to Enola, who is hiding in a tree, and he just lays with his back on the tree like a young romantic lead from some Victorian novel trying to talk to an upset girl into climbing back down. I immediately thought, ""Sherlock Holmes would never lay by a tree like that oh so tenderly.""None of this matters because Sherlock's function in this story isn't meant to be another version of the legendary Mr. Holmes, but actually a big brother figure to Enola as a symbolic representation of someone who is free to pursue who they want to be in Victorian society. At times, Sherlock's intellect is set up as something for Enola to surpass. Even Mycroft, whose characterization is also not accurate to his literary origins, is a representation of conforming to Victorian traditions which makes him the antagonist.Millie Bobby Brown is charming and relishing in her lead part as Enola. She does jujitsu, archery, and receives a homeschool education in Victorian times, something probably a woman wouldn't have access to in real life, but we are living how things should be through her. Brown does a great job taking the audience through that. Her character was strongest in the earlier parts of the film when she was doing nimble-witted things in her country home speaking directly into the camera which brought a wistful frenetic youthful energy.The latter parts are where the film starts to sag and flipflopping between its subplots. The mystery that Enola has to solve is fairly simple and predictable and the story is predominantly concerned with making its revisionist feminist commentary than setting up an intricate mystery for the audience to truly sink our teeth into. Enola isn't exactly a female Sherlock Holmes. At the end of it, she felt more like an urban swashbuckler who just gets into adventures. And for that, this film doesn't feel very Sherlock Holmes at all.I was never invested in the potential love story, which the film teases us with, but what it actually is is a commentary on the convention of how we always need to include a love story in every movie. The film seemed to be so allergic to the prospect of its female protagonist falling in love for a boy as that would entirely nullify the film's premise as that would make Enola solely dependent on her male béau.If this was the case, why didn't the writers just have Enola help out another girl who, too, is feeling repressed as a woman in Victorian society? In broad terms, perhaps a nurse who wants to be a chance at being certified a doctor named Johanna Hamisha Watson? For that very reason, instead of Sherlock and Mycroft, what the film really needed more of was Eudoria Holmes, the mother played by Helena Bonham Carter. It seemed like that would be the actual dialogue the film would have wanted to have.Enola Holmes is a cute charming romp and will play best for the young adult age group who thinks Enola is a cool heroine and that her fourth-wall-breaking is cool and edgy. They will go to college, take a literature class, find better idols, and read better fourth-wall-breaking later down the line. If a primary or middle school girl watches this and feels empowered by it, then it has done its job. Hopefully, if this becomes a franchise, as a mystery fan, personally I'd want more intricately crafted mystery plots.For my own personal tastes, I much prefer if Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss gave us a Eurus Holmes spinoff from Benedict Cumberbatch's BBC Sherlock. You know, the youngest Holmes sibling who is so super intelligent, she is borderline murderous. Eurus would find her missing mother within a prison-supervised 5 minutes on the Internet.",Enola Holmes

213,JonathanWalford,Enola was born in 1868 you movie producers.,4,28 September 2020,"The movie starts with Enola giving us a bit of an 'up til now' biography and begins with a scene of herself as a baby with a big '1884' date splashed on the screen. Soon we are told that she is 16. If my math is correct 1884 plus 16 is 1900, and this is underscored by the fact that we see Enola riding a bicycle typical of c. 1900.Soon, however, it becomse apparent that the costuming is wrong for 1900. Big bustled dresses are typical of 1884, and then an important plot point regarding the Third Reform and Redistribution Act of 1884 enters the storyline, and we even see Sherlock is reading a newspaper dated 1884. How can a multi-million dollar production make such an egregious error as to suggest she is born the very year the story takes place?The writing is thin, very thin. The plot is predictable and pointless, the women are made to look smarter than men by writing the men as stupid. Meanwhile, her mother is at the source of a plot that could kill hundreds of people, and she is written as some sort of feminist heroine.What is a shame is that the talent was there - the idea for the film is brilliant, the actors hired were good choices, but the writing, editing, and direction are substandard.",Enola Holmes

Doesn't hollywood have any new generation writers that can write stories?"" I still think this :), and I didn't hate this movie as much as I thought I would. I liked the twist of her narrating, and Back and forth into memories of her childhood to understand her character. I'm glad that Sherlock and Mycroft didn't take over the story, making it between her and them. Mycroft really got to me at points but that's his character. Although they made it all about enola and her adventure of development/life decisions/ growing up, it still touched upon solving puzzles as a red line. I wonder why they didn't explore her role in her mother's plotting more, female rights, blowing up something.... That could have been something interesting and unique too explore? Instead of keeping it fairly safe and stick to detective angle(it worked for the brother sow...) 2 open ends that cries for a part 2 I think. First, her life as a (becoming)detective, perhaps joining Sherlock as he wants her as his ward (pre-watson era). Second, the whole mom angle stopping her blowing up parliament (probably 5th November style although that was in 1605, women rights in 1918 )",Enola Holmes

The confrontation between the actors works
as a fine point for the film. The ending is just ok. Overall it's a movie that you can definitely watch for at least once.",Enola Holmes
221,c-kelsall,Delightful,9,28 January 2021,"Enola Holmes is a literary creation of American author Nancy Springer - who, incidentally, is better known to me as an author of fantasy novels; an addendum to the Holmes family created by Arthur Conan Doyle. Think Young Sherlock Holmes, except in this case the youth in question is a younger sister to the famous detective.
Enola has been raised alone by her spirited, independent widowed mother, while her much older brothers have long since left the family home in the country and established their own well-known careers. Enola is therefore raised to think as her mother does, without reference to male or patriarchal influences. Mother and daughter enjoy puzzles and intellectually challenging and physical pursuits, and definitely not any of the things respectable ladies of the period are expected to do. Enola is very intelligent, but not worldy. Then, when Enola turns 16, her mother vanishes without a word. Why has she left, where has she gone, and can Enola find her?
I personally found Enola Holmes to be a delightful film. Millie Bobby Brown is an absolute star, and she shines very brightly in a role which could easily have been written for her. Perhaps it was, since she also has a producer credit for this film. I saw an interview with her on-screen mum Helena Bonham-Carter, who said MBB is an absolute powerhouse; I didn't quite get what she meant at the time, but now I think I do.
MBB is ably supported by a fairly starry cast - Henry Cavill (Sherlock), Burn Gorman, Fiona Shaw (who is always good value), the aforementioned HB-C, Sam Claflin (Mycroft), Frances de la Tour, David Bamber, Hattie Morahan and Adeel Akhtar - who all do good work. The young chap who plays the Marquis of Tewkesbury (Louis Partridge) is also very good.
The pacing of the film is pretty much perfect, it kept me engaged throughout. MBB is such an engaging presence on screen, and there are very few scenes where she is not present because the story is told very much from her point of view. It is, after all, her story; a coming-of-age story wrapped up in a mystery with clues to be solved. Anyone who doesn't appreciate Enola will not enjoy this film.
The only criticism I might levy is that there are obviously historical inaccuracies (unlikely 'colour-blind' casting in some small roles; the reform bill in the House of Lords to give women the vote did not in fact occur until 1918, while the Reform Act of 1832 to give ordinary men the vote in the UK had already occurred prior to the setting of this story), but it is fiction, not history. For similar reasons some might bridle at the blurring of class boundaries and the incipient emancipation of women (the women's Judo class, for example), but to my mind the whole point of those elements was that Enola was raised not to accept the established precepts of society.
In summary, Enola Holmes is a family film which is not intended to be taken seriously, but there's a wholesome, positive message about the human condition there if you want it.",Enola Holmes

The character doesn't have a real struggle and when she does it's all solved. The second lead is just another boring guy to make the main character look better, at least he was actually smart and not comic relief. He just had no depth to his character. It would've been better if the male lead died at the end but instead he didn't and it made the story so unrealistic. Even the reveal about the mother was bad and underwhelming. There were no stakes in this movie and everything worked out in the end. If you look past all of those things it's a pretty okay movie but this movie is just another example of cringe feminism.

He cleverly bridges the flashback sequences, so that you can also simplify the events around you.Millie Bobby Brown is an excellent choice to play the title character and never let the sadness of this part diminish his mental strength.Apart from 'Stranger Things', it is fantastic to see her in a good character. Her presence makes the film more exciting.Sam Claflin's Mycroft is a lot more poignant than seen on the BBC's version. Unfortunately, Henry's opportunity to focus on Sherlock assumes that his character must be found in the narrative.Sherlock went unnoticed as Henry's costumes, body language to mold himself.Luis Partridge is beloved as the handsome, young prince who shares on-screen chemistry with Brown with a terrifying spirit.Helena Bonham Carter as Eudora Holmes has a limited presence, but the way she uses her presence minimally and so effectively.I believe Harry Bradbeer had a solid reason to keep this film for only 120 minutes. It is a conscious decision to bring non-Sherlock fans to their territory.Although the film still seems a little slow, but Harry Bradbeer has handled it well.Enola Holmes is an emotional mother-daughter story, but it is full of action, comedy, drama and lots of thrills.",Enola Holmes
231,zadeereviews,Ehh.. it's so so,5,27 September 2020,I'm a huge Sherlock Holmes fan. I've Almost read all Sherlock Holmes books and watched all Sherlock Holmes movies. I gave this a go hoping to see something similar to Sherlock Holmes. It's nothing like Sherlock Holmes. I was kind of disappointed that they gave a back seat to Sherlock in this movie. Great acting by all. Plot and story wise it's ok. Gave me a snore here and there. I got kind of annoyed with her breaking the 4th wall. I guess it was a style that they went for but it didn't work for me. It's good for teens and girls to make them think out of box and how to stand for something you believe and want even if you are alonE.,Enola Holmes
232,xpics,After a point you just don't care!,4,28 September 2020,"The pulling factor for me, like most other audience I presume, was Millie Bobby Brown - the girl who got famous as El in Stranger Things. Of course there was the Sherlock connection as well to look forward to. But after a while, Millie's charm could not pull off the lousy writing of the film and the Sherlock connection wasn't of the 'wow' variety either.The film starts with Enola in pursuit of her missing mother, who disappears one night without rhyme or reason. While that seems like an interesting hook point for a film, the pay off at the end is plain lackadaisical. Enola's brothers Sherlock and Mycroft come to her. Her relationship with both is strained and you just don't know why. Perhaps you are expected to do some homework and come prepared reading Sherlock history. Further the plot digresses to a young Prince running away from his royal family. And when this Prince is shot in the chest in the pre-climax and he pulls out his bullet-proof vest to show that he smartly saved himself, you know that the narrative has turned as formulaic and old as it's ancient setting.Despite the fact that search for her mother seems like a solemn conflict, the narrative is far from the serious tone and Enola remains lively and effervescent throughout. The mood is pretty upbeat. However the 'talking-to-camera' style of storytelling loses its effect when the makers overdo it. To its credit, the film oozes an old-world charm with its picturesque town, vintage train compartments, steam-engine running motor cars and ancient London setting. However the screenplay gets muddled with archiac subplots of a political conspiracy and a power-tussle in royal family formula.After a point you don't care for the characters or the story. Disappointing!",Enola Holmes
233,dan_slentz,A Real Let Down...,4,26 September 2020,"With a very good, well-known cast, maybe I was expecting too much. I watched this with my 19 year old daughter, she enjoyed this more than I, but the story wasn't really that strong and the continuity felt ""disjointed"". Things just seemed to ""happen"" because a writer said ""wow.. we need to throw SOMETHING.. ANYTHING.. in here!""
If I wanted a character talking to the camera (which really WAS pointless for this movie), I would have watched ""The Office"" (at least in that case it's meant to felt like a documentary). I'm sure someone who wrote or directed this thought ""this will be novel"", but they forget that watching a movie like this is to ""be a part of the story for the audience"". I give them credit for not, at least, stopping the movie completely to ask the food services people what THEY thought, or a cutaway shot of the production crew behind cameras watching the production. (Which, for me, is what it's like having a character go between interacting with the other characters and stopping to talk to the camera in this sort of movie.) It was a LONG two hours! I'll take a Robert Downey Jr. ""Holmes"" movie any day over this!! I really think this movie had the potential to be a whole LOT more!! I gave it a four out of 10. Won't be watching it again.. nor would I recommend it. ""Reel Tunez... The Radio Show All About the Movies""",Enola Holmes

237,JanJanuary,"A great film, with a great story and cast BONUS Helene Bonham Carter",10,6 February 2021,"I must admit I hadn't fancied this film and just ignored it - after one episode of the awful 'Elementary' with Lucy what'sit, I couldn't handle another substandard Holmes based story. I'd seen pictures of this film but just ignored it. Then a friend told me, yes she told me to watch it. I'm so glad I did.From the opening scenes, to the final one it's a joy to watch. The actress playing Enola is great and a natural (reminded me of a young Killing Eve actress) and then, to my delight, there was Helena Bonham Carter playing her mum. Looking lovely as ever and acting so brilliantly, as ever.I love the actors playing Mycroft and Sherlock, they did such a good job, especially Mycroft. I love Adell Akhtar too as L'estrade. He's great in everything I've seen in him. It was great seen Hatfield House and other locations mentioned (Bethnal Green, where I worked for some years - when do you ever see Bethnal Green and Limehouse mentioned in films nowadays!)It seems that the estate of Conan Doyle attempted to sue the makers of the film for showing 'Holmes having emotion' which would be 'out of character'. Isn't that just daft? Sadly Conan-Doyle's sons died without having children of their own, so there are no direct descendants. I watched a great documentary about the author which showed his 'playboy' sons having no interest in their father's work, and selling rights to it to anyone who came forward and for the best price. How things have changed. Glad that the estate lost, Cavill plays the role as every other Doyle has played it, but then we didn't see him interact with a 'younger sister..Great film, great script, great cast, great scenery and locations. Loved it.",Enola Holmes
238,matej-trkanjec-133-920386,"Under 15 - a great flick, over 15 - o boy.",6,28 September 2020,"As the Enola Holmes flick hit Netflix, I was just as excited as the next person seeing Brown in the lead role, as well as Cavil as Sherlock and a handful of other famous actors in prominent roles. The very concept is intriguing, fun and in most part - entertaining. However, it lacks certain elements that will make it a really interesting and memorable September flick, potentially spawning numerous sequels.1) The plot. There seems to be a bit of a hard cut in this department as the movie actually follows one quite interesting plot point up until half of the movie. For some, to me unexplained reason, this plot was entirely abandoned and another was commenced entirely. The two plot points were intended to be connected, as the ending of the movie insinuates, but the way they are told is completely unprofessional and I am not sure as to what exactly happened here. The first plot - finding mother - is abandoned almost at the peak of its depiction, indicating that something sinister is at hand. The other - finding the lost marquess - is dull and uninteresting up until the very ending of the movie that reveals why exactly he was being hunted. The two plots were supposed to co-exists and bring up an unified ending, but the movie never does that. It simply abandons the first one leaving the viewers with a final rushed scene trying to explain what happened with her mother, but it doesn't really do that at all. It is up to the imagination of the viewer as to what was going on, and an average viewer over the age of 15 will have no trouble concluding a quite sinister and frankly, disturbing plot. It is a shame that this was not explored more as this would have been a much more interesting movie in the end. Secondly, the very underlining theme of female emancipation is extremely vivid even though the movie never really states what the crucial segments are - the suffragettes, the right for women to vote and so on and so on. But the implications are all over the place, leaving one to wonder why these crucial segments were not explored more openly. Henceforth, a movie that starts quite interestingly dissolves into a young adult teen fiction that will not satisfy anyone over the age of 15 (but with today's standards I will sooner go with 13).2) The acting. The hypnotising acting abilities of Brown are the sole selling point of this movie, and they are rightfully so. Her range of emotions and depiction of them is staggering. Her ability to convey almost exactly what she is feeling and how she handles much greater professionals then herself is phenomenal. The ""breaking the fourth wall"" scenes are by far the most entertaining as you can actually see how much fun she is having playing the title character and how she actually dug deep into the complexities of what and who she is playing. Her career is in an upright spiral and I do believe it do go even higher. Cavil on the other hand was... dull. It is almost a joy to see him play Sherlock but there is a fundamental problem with his portrayal - he didn't play Sherlock... I am not aware as to who he played, but that was not Sherlock. Just one look as to his approach is enough for a casual viewer to determine that he is a bit lost within the character and goes for the silent type, but I detect a bit of constraint to his portrayal. I am not sure however, if that is to be the screenplay and direction or his lack of understanding of the character. Given his latter work, I am inclined to think that it is the screenplay and direction. Claflin, however, did a spectacular job portraying the period piece ""gentleman"" that thinks women are baby machines and kitchen material. His portrayal is frenetic and intense at all times, but, the same as Cavil, his portrayal differs greatly from the original material. If he is to be a representation of that time's male (and n some cases female) mentality, then it is a job well done. Also, when confronted with Brown, it is quite visible that they are a perfect character match portraying different mentalities and standpoints. Also, it is an incredible shame that this segment was not explored in more detail.3) The directing/editing. The movie was edited quite nicely up to about half of its duration. Up from there, as stated above, the editing becomes more and more in the service of prolonging a movie in the worst way possible. The two interwoven story-lines should have intercepted sooner and should have been told simultaneously, climaxing as they come to a full crossing. This was not, however the case, and it is only to the blame of the director for not creating this intriguing and generally, often used method.All in all, this is really a young adult movie through and through. It is engaging for the most part, interesting at points and generally entertaining. It deals with important and difficult issues but never fully addresses them. It uses interesting techniques that it does not fully develop and starts plot points that it does not finish in a satisfactory manner. However, despite these notions, this is a full rounded and finished movie. It is just a shame it was not a bit more rounded and straightforward. In the end, anyone older than 15 will have a problem with it as it will serve for a rainy Sunday afternoon if and only if, nothing else is available.",Enola Holmes
239,A-Shekhar,I loved it!,9,30 September 2020,"Watch it and make up your own mind, people here are way too torn about it. NO, it wasn't dull nor was it disappointing and there is nothing to better, it's good just the way it is",Enola Holmes

Her moments of talking to the audience were delightful. Chalfin made a perfectly despicable Mycroft Holmes although Cavill's character as Sherlock was a bit understated. That character showed some expertise but was typically behind the talents of his sister, Enola which I suppose should be how the story would go. Regardless of the shortcomings of the overall story the film was extremely enjoyable and fun to watch. Burn Gorman and Fiona Shaw were both excellent in their respective roles.",Enola Holmes

I'm only a casual Sherlock Holmes fan but I couldn't get into the Benedict Cumberbatch series. Enola Holmes is a fun little film.The acting is good mainly Brown since she's the lead. Brown is charming, she should have a long career ahead of her. Cavill played four iconic characters now which is something. I'm not famaliar with Sam Claflin, I guess he's not well known outside England.The film is PG-13 but it's family friendly, kids can watch it. It barely has cursing or you could say there's none. The film is lighthearted, it has plenty of humor but it's not laugh out loud funny. Enola meets a boy, they flirt several times.The mystery is simple but engaging. I understand why some feel it's boring or lacking but I feel the resolution was lacking. The film is fast paced mainly the first act. The film is ten minutes overlong but it's not a major flaw.Enola Holmes is a fun film which can easily spawn a franchise. Sherlock and mystery fans should enjoy it.

251,mr_sharma,It could have been so much better,6,26 September 2020,"There are plenty of Holmes' yarns about.One set in modern times. One where he gets old. Comedies. Gritty. Light hearted. And now this. The twist is that The Holmes' brothers have a younger sister.She's 16ish and therefore the appeal is to the modern viewer.There are a number of issues with this film.Primarily, it's to do with the script.The pacing is off. It plods. That stems from it being overlong (over 2 hours).I understand value for money but there isn't anything amazing on display to warrant the extra minutes.It's trying to be a forward thinking, historical, detective story wrapped up in a 39 steps type plot. It alludes to reform and past historical ""threats"" But never really explains them.You would think with Bobbi-brown (spelling?) in the lead, with stranger things in her arsenal of work, that it would be more engaging....and more so when you have Cavil and Caflin in support.....but Millie is not really someone who can carry this on her own. Her regular breaking of the 4th wall starts to feel laboured and trying. It get it rating rather than being funny, mused or cute.Cavil is a sideshow really with his Sherlock (definitely see BOND written all over his future) and Caflin plays it up an over bearing brother (his character reminded me of that horrible character he played in Nightingale). Too 1 dimensional. Which, frankly, could be said of all the characters in this film.Helena Bonham-Carter is the best thing in this but she hardly appears other than occasional flashbacks.There are a little too many coincidences to make it palatable.The saving grace, from the lack of pace, is the ending. That, though, feels like the film it should have been. More harder edged, action packed and unexpected (although there are a lot of logic leaps and coincidences for my liking to get us there).Ultimately, we watched it as a family and my 16 year old daughter liked it, my youngest was ok about it and us two adults thought it was pretty forgettable.It really could have been so much better.",Enola Holmes
252,cristinalinderman,A heartwarming and fun adaptation.,9,28 September 2020,"* (Rating 9.5/10) ** There is no end credit scene *The director Harry Bradbeer plus the crew brought a heartwarming and fun adaptation. The story sets when Enola's mother goes missing and she sets off to find her while stumbling upon a conspiracy. When I watched the trailer I knew I was going to love every second of it. This film was pure joy mainly due to the lead on breaking the fourth wall, a very entertaining perspective in which keeps us viewers more involved in the story and it worked fantastically in this kind of film. I was worried about the roles of Mycroft and Sherlock because I didn't want them to shine over Enola and thankfully they didn't. Her brothers had well-balanced roles such as enough for Enola to take her stand and make this film her own.I dare say I loved this movie more than the Sherlock Holmes films and even the Sherlock series. Not only it focuses on a strong female character the story also represents what we are struggling with since the beginning of how the society wants to control our paths making it harder for us to make our own choices. Additionally, the mother and daughter's side story was overwhelmingly moving. I like how her first fight scene was so realistic, given the fact she had never done it in the open world only training with her mother. Every breath and every punch she took made it believable. I'm looking forward to a sequel, I would love to watch another adventure, and would be so great for a mother-daughter working side by side.The composer Daniel Pemberton sets magnificently the tone of mystery with his music, a familiar atmosphere to not let us forget that this is a Holmes film.Solid performance from all the actors and I liked Henry Cavill's version as Sherlock, a more sentimental side so beautifully shown towards Enola. Millie Bobby Brown as the brilliant Enola, what an exhilarating performance, she brought the spunk, the bold, the witty, and the heroic so extraordinary and so invitingly.",Enola Holmes

254,rogier-86785,Feel Good Holmes,7,24 September 2020,"Enola Holmes is a side take on the original Sherlock Holmes story, featuring the younger teenage sister Enola of the Holmes family on a quest to discover herself and the world through a crime mystery.Broken down, the film is essentially a bright version of a Holmes investigation, looked at through the young and optimistic eyes of co-producer Millie Bobby Brown who also plays the lead role. Don't expect this to have the same dark tone as the original stories or the brilliantly brutal modern day version of BBC's Sherlock. It's a feel-good film and it knows it.The positives are that its well filmed, stooped in magical realism, has some tacky but outspoken music - a welcome rarity these days - and involves fun mysteries and some smart twists. Special shout out goes to the editors, who give the film a great tempo. The expert cast performs very well and I felt a real connection to the characters because of it.The mystery itself revolves around the theme of women fighting for their place in society and serves as a reminder that equality was as hard to find in days past as it still is sometimes today. This theme has arguably been portrayed a lot better in the Sherlock episode of The Abominable Bride, but it doesn't take away much from the message regardless, and gives a nice boost to the idea that we all create our own fate.Where the film begins to falter is the lack of stakes. Although enough danger happens, you never feel as if the characters are really fighting an uphill battle. The plot also feels too full at times, which is probably the youthful energy of its makers shining through. It's forgivable yes, but it does take away from the film.An immediately apparent flaw of the writers is that Sherlock is portrayed as a nice man, which is of course completely out of character. So nice in fact that it even sparked protest from the descendants of the original writer (Doyle). For us viewers it just feels like a missed opportunity. We can understand why Sherlock is softer here. But although Henry Cavill performs the character well, it would have been perfectly possible to give Sherlock a lot more bite, without ruining the intentions of the plot.I personally found it all elegantly done. In truth, it's more of a six, but the extra point to a seven I gave for its energy and daring. If the stakes had been higher, my score would've been higher too. But as it stands, a good debut behind the scenes for young Millie Bobby Brown, and she plays great in front of the camera too.Just be prepared: this is a feel-good Holmes story. And although entertaining, that will feel like a bit of a mystery in and out of itself.",Enola Holmes

Sam Claflin as Mycroft Holmes was incredible, he was able to give us the role of that mean / annoying old brother perfectly, the whole cast was not a trouble at all, they were all great in their performances.The first half of the film was amazing and I really enjoyed it but the second half was the problem, I felt like the second half of the film was chaos and I got lost and also felt like the movie went far away and was not focusing on the main story which is a thing that I was really annoyed about, felt like the movie was trying to be too many things in once, I got really bored in the second half and couldn't wait for the movie to be over.The set design was so incredible and the movie had some frames that were visually stunning, the camera angles were able to capture the nature around in a perfect way that I really loved, the custom designs were so cool, the different customs of Enola Holmes and suits of Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes were all incredible.Loved how the movie breaks the fourth wall, and how Enola explains some stuff to us in a beautiful way that if you watched the movie you'll get what I mean, that was a great touch in the movie.Enola Holmes is a movie that is not what you expect just because it has the name ""Holmes"" in it, It's not about solving a mystery or surprising the audience, it focuses on the message that is for young teen girls and that's to go after what you want, not care about society and choose the path that you want and not others want for you which is a very sweet message for those young teen girls.

259,BoulosSoueileh,Good but (Cliché),8,2 October 2020,"Enola holmes, a drama adventure movie, starting Millie Bobby brown, Sam claffin and henry cavill as the holmes. Where enola a 16 years old girl wants to find her lost mother with many and many challenges on her way.
Generally, the movie was good, art direction, Cinematography, lighting and casting were goof but yet what's the purpose.
After 90 minutes enola changes her goal to save the LORD she met on her way, and yet she didn't find her mother, her mother found her. Enola solves a case that wasn't really important for the theme of the movie even though they won the votes by ONE VOTE, really?
Sam claffin was great as always, he did his role perfectly, as well as all the secondary stars of the movie.
But when you choose someone to play your main role in the movie, to start a sequel i believe, you don't choose someone who only appeared in 9 movies and 1 series. Just imagine Hailey stainfield in that role.
And for a sarcastic, smart and fast character you don't choose Henry cavill. And just a reminder they mentioned first that Sherlock is good at boxing, where did this helped me in course of the movie.?
The action of the movie were expected, cliché ideas, and cliché progressing.

261,grarunkumar1994,"Disgrace to ""Holmes""",1,26 September 2020,"There had been umpteen attempts to recreate Arthur Conan Doyle's Detective, a creation more eminent than the creator; most of which leaves without a trail, with a few staying in memory- Robert Downey Jr and Benedict Cumberbatch being the recent ones.
Enola Holmes is an attempt to squeeze out money from the satisfaction of viewers to revisit mystery solving in Victorian England by a genius detective, the one Arthur had addicted us with.
Here, the makers are adamant to do it but lazy to write a script suitable for the character. Next best option? Write up a sibling who is as intelligent as him, but a bit immature. And there she is. His younger sister.
Story is even more pathetic. The lady Holmes disappears 'without a trace'..but leaves a ton of clues for Enola to find. Enola leaves home in search of her mother. She gets involved with a boy, a teenage well read , charismatic guy from a respected family, weak enough for Enola to save him multiple times and dumb enough to not understand he is a target for murder. Romance blooms in between this ""finding mom"" and ""staying alive"" mysteries.
Apparently mother had taught Enola everything from encyclopedia to JuJitsu to tackle problems in life. Quite convenient.
If the makers had intention to do this way, sticking on to ""Holmes"" name should be understood as cheap marketing technique to attract audience.
Wouldn't have complained so much if the screenplay was decent at the least. This is a pathetic attempt to make a movie.
Did Mother leave for secret meetings- Yes.
Did she carry on with the plan- No.
Did the emotions work out in movie - No.
Was the romance good- Cliched
Was the plot stromg regarding female suppression in 19th century - No. A few lines is not enough.
Are the fights good( after all these claim that ""mother taught me"")- Pathetic.
The assassin- slowpoke, more distractable than a scared rabbit, gets easily beat up by 16yr old girl.( Most definitely it wasnt jujitsu or any other martial art that gave her the upper hand)
The teen boy - ripped right out of a high school romantic drama.
Only good things.
Cinematography.
Production value - the real & virtual sets.
Henry Cavil as Sherlock. a brief but not so impressive presence, yet he looks suitable.
If the makers had ambitious hope to make such a movie, the least they could do is to get a gripping screenplay.
Nancy Springer would have threatened Hollywood to make a movie from such a novel.",Enola Holmes
262,Nathan4,"Good, not great",7,25 October 2020,"This would be about a 5.5 we're it not for Millie Bobby Brown. The story is ok - more of a coming-of-age story than a detective story, which is fine...there's just not enough there other than Enola's interactions with the audience and Millie being her fantastic, charming self and stealing the show as always.A light, fun adventure worth a one-time watch.",Enola Holmes
263,sashamyshkina,Absolutely nothing special.,3,31 December 2020,"This movie had so, so much potential. It could have been amazing. It could have been the awesome, badass, feminist mystery the world needed. But it wasn't.Please note that this review contains spoilers.There is very little intrigue to start off with, and the mystery doesn't unfold in a particularly interesting way with no genuinely shocking moments. The characters felt flat, and then there's the fact that this not-even-a-mystery isn't even solved at the end. Of course! Why should it? Netflix absolutely NEEDS for this to become a money-making series, and we have to ensure that the ending of the first one is annoying enough to make viewers want to come back for more.This movie just feels too modern, in terms of style and language, to be a period piece - something about the character's interactions completely breaks the image of Victorian England that has been set up by the costumes and sets.Also, I think that the part that sparked the downfall of this movie was the choice to include fourth war breaks. If done properly, breaking the fourth wall and having the actors communicate something directly to the audience can be perfect and hilarious (case and point: Deadpool and The Wolf of Wall Street), but it just made this movie seem so childish. One of the first rules of cinema is ""show don't tell"" whilst here you have the titular character literally just explaining everything to you. Also, the thing with fourth wall breaks is that you've got to include them at the appropriate times - when there isn't too much action happening and there's an explanatory section. Far too often, the movie is in the midst of a tense moment and then has Enola turn to the camera and completely dissipates any realism or build-up.The jokes were bad. The script was poorly written and I think that there was no good acting in this - everyone was just playing the Stereotypical British Person, complete with a cardboard personality and the fact that every line felt like it was being read off a piece of paper without it being learned. . Millie Bobby Brown is a great actress and she was excellent in the few episodes I watched of Stranger Things but here I think she was miscast.Thoroughly underwhelming.-Sasha.",Enola Holmes

269,ivo_shandor,Could be better as a series,5,28 September 2020,"Enola Holmes is a fine thing to twiddle away the afternoon for on Netflix. Great music, production, and cast, but it needs to be toned way down in some areas, and made clearer story-wise in others. All the shuffle of a grander scheme feels pushed to the side, and lends itself to predictability and annoying character choices at times. While grating, it has a quirky demeanor and charm that could make a series better for it, rather than just a one-off movie. I'd rather see Enola take on more traditional mysteries than one's with a preachy message. There's a reason the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew are still remembered, because mysteries like those draw the attention of those young at heart, and those who wish for a simpler plot. It's harmless enough and has it's little quirks, but with a tighter, cleverer script it could be a little more satisfying. I would be curious to see more, as long as it takes a step back and finds it's niche in the simple and quirky rather than a preachy annoyance. It's right in the middle, and you can't progress if you aim for the middle. With some more time and tweaking, it could be a fun little series.",Enola Holmes

277,vesil_vesalier,Creative. Refreshing. Funny. Charming. Beautiful. Well done!,9,24 September 2020,"The first time I saw Millie Bobby Brown was, like so many others, in STRANGER THINGS. I'd heard about the show from so many people, and didn't get the hype until I rolled the dice and gave it a shot. Being a huge fan of Stephen King's work helped to make me appreciate something truly unique and even special in the show.It's refreshing, being someone growing older in years, to see such talent in the new generations to come.ENOLA HOLMES stars Millie as Enola, Henry Cavill as Sherlock, Sam Claflin as Mycroft, and the always legendary and wonderful Helena Bonham Carter as their mother, Eudoria. It was directed by Mr. Harry Bradbeer who, up until this point, seems to have only directed television episodes and shorts.First thing's first then... hats off to you, sir! For a wide selection of choices that I found to be absolutely wonderful in delivery, charm, humor and writing. However you managed to pull all of this together is quite surprising and refreshingly original.Three things stand out for me in this film. The first is the choice to constantly break the third wall, as they say. Looking back at the film it was quite a bold and wonderful way to make light of something that could have been a much more serious film - which would have detracted from its overall delivery. I laughed out loud SO many times during the run of the film and have thoroughly enjoyed the ride.The second was the cinematography. I have a bad habit of sounding out ""Beautiful shot"" whenever I see one in a film, and this one had so many I was floored. The scope of the camera amidst lush green forests and broad spectrum cityscapes truly added to the wonder of the film. I have the urge to attempt to go and capture as many as I can and have them scroll through the background of the desktop of my computer.The last was Millie herself. While watching STRANGER THINGS I have been impressed by EVERYONE'S acting (well except for Wynona Rider maybe, but I've always been on the fence with her ability anyway). I liked Millie's delivery, but felt the same way I did when I was watching Emma Watson in Harry Potter... I saw potential, but a lack of experience. It is wholeheartedly refreshing to see Millie really strut her stuff here. She is amazing, and I look forward to everything she will do with her career as the years roll by.Now I'm not going to claim the film is perfect. It does have some pacing issues, where the flow slows to a crawl in some spots and takes a bit too long to pick back up again. Also the entire stretch of the story involving Enola attempting to conform with the school she's assigned to felt unnecessary and even somewhat poorly delivered. Sam Claflin's Mycroft doesn't have the charm I'm used to seeing in other portrayals of Sherlock's brother, to the point where he was infuriatingly unfeeling toward his sister and her situation, making him more of a nuisance than I felt he should have been.But these issues are very small, and the parts the film hits on more than make up for the misses. I almost forgot to mention Tewkesbury, played by Louis Partridge, who at first seemed to be a bit of an empty character, only to develop nicely as the film rolled on.Helena Bonham Carter needs to be mentioned, so much as she doesn't need to be. A legend in her own right, she gives the film exactly what it needs in the few scenes she is in, as the caring but mysterious mother of the Holmes clan. I've never seen her deliver a bad performance, and she does her usual here.All in all, I loved ENOLA HOLMES. It's charming in its delivery, beautiful in its scenery, hilarious in its humor and touching just where it needs to be in all the right places. I had a lot of fun watching this film, and I look forward to watching it again when the opportunity presents itself.",Enola Holmes

She's about breaking the norms. It's history; you can't argue with history.Now, the movie is fun. I love the idea of Sherlock Holmes having a little sister, and I love the Nancy Drew vibe. Millie Bobby Brown is a wonderful actress, and really brings this character to life. Netflix has finally made a film that parents will enjoy watching with their preteens.There are some far fetched moments while she is running through all of England looking for her mother and saving a boy's life.

Nothing world shattering here, just an entertaining way to pass a couple of hours with two teenage girls (my nieces) and Enola! Millie Bobby Brown is such a winning and charming actress that anything she's in is elevated because of her. In this she's very cute, feisty and funny. The plot is fast moving and quite exciting in places and I have to say it was great seeing Henry Cavill in a a supporting role as brother Sherlock. In tone it is quite light hearted, a bit like the Robert Downey Jnr incarnation of Holmes, but without the violence.

And make no mistake, she looks and acts wonderful. But if you were looking for mystery, there isn't one. It basically turns out to be a teen drama which has feminist virtues.

298,ninjawaiter,Really Appreciated the Pro-Terrorist Messaging,4,11 June 2021,"That's sarcasm, I was not a fan of the pro-terrorist messaging. The fact that Enola manages to make the planned terrorist acts unnecessary in no way alleviates the fact that her mother and her compatriots were planning mass-murder on an epic scale. This is evidenced by the fact that at the end both Enola and her mother acknowledge that her mother must remain on the run, forever, and Enola will have to continue on her own. That's right, mom isn't a manic pixie, she's a terrorist.Apart from the underlying pro-terrorist theme, this film is weak even at its best. The cast is great, of course, but the script is lazy and often downright stupid, and the protagonist comes off as a Mary Sue even in the context of being a sibling to Sherlock Holmes, himself a ""man of many parts"" to be exceptionally kind.Henry Cavill's Sherlock is... un-Sherlock-ish, and Mycroft is an abomination, but those would both be entirely forgivable given that it's not their film. The viscount, on the other hand, is atrocious, and the film's inability to praise or elevate Enola without doing so by contrastingly degrading its male characters is quite unfortunate. Instead of simply displaying Enola succeeding, the film almost always insists on accentuating her successes by pointing out matching failures by the men (and boy) around her.Obviously the film is targeted at young girls, and apart from the pro-terrorist messaging, the overall tone is lighthearted and uplifting, encouraging girls to be themselves and whatnot. Unfortunately it does so in such an overt, in-your-face manner, sometimes literally speaking the messages directly to the camera, that it comes across as heavy-handed and preachy rather than inspirational.I wish I had more positive to say about this film, but it really just wasn't very good. I'll give a dishonorable mention to the 5 minute knock-down drag-out fight in the daytime streets of 19th century London that isn't witnessed by a single soul, because apparently that part of one of the most crowded cities in the world is just completely empty in the middle of the day. That's to say nothing of the fight itself, which is pretty terrible.There's plenty to go on about, but why belabor the point? It's not terrible, but it's certainly not good, and with a 5 star rating from me meaning ""Eh, it passed the time,"" this didn't even clear that low bar of watchability. Also, the pro-terrorist messaging is pretty bad, in case you didn't get the point the first few times I mentioned it.",Enola Holmes

The movie tries to keep the dynamics and atmosphere of the famous Sherlock Holmes movies with Robert Downey Jr. Though Millie Bobby Brown showed that she is quite the actress and that she can do more than Stranger Things, the movie and the plot doesn't live up to her acting.The movie is about solving cases and it doesn't let us, the audience, enough time to decipher the clues when Enola Holmes is often breaking the fourth wall by addressing directly to the audience. Instead, they quickly explain the codes when other scenes progress really slowly.Also, the main plot happens around the extension of voting for women in 1884. The movie leaves quite some clues but not enough to be sure of what it is about. You are left with these wandering thoughts: ""What is going on? Why do they want to kill the viscount?""

305,Maedhros35,Unremarkable,5,21 November 2020,"As neon-green-and-pink and terrible hair is iconic for the 1980's and grunge is for the 1990's, political correctness will forever be associated with the first quarter of this century - and this movie is a quintessential product of this politicall correctness.Of course, all men are evil - if only by association as is Sherlock Holmes, who stands by idly and does nothing while his evil bitter and overbearing brother - who hates independent women - tries to send the protagonist off.And all women are heroes - even mothers who abandon their daughter to these evil men while leaving wihout providing any reason (on the 16th birthday of that daughter, moreover).The rest of the movie is quite stale and predictable, and Ms Brown is okay but not that great.Mostly suited for girls 12-16; otherwise a no-no.",Enola Holmes

310,Idle_Hands08,Teen Version of the Guy Ritchie genre,7,24 September 2020,"This movie was a lot of fun... I'm a fan of the action packed Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes films, and this felt a lot like a PG-13 version of those films... It's rated M for the action sequences, which were well done, but definitely had that PG feel to it. The production design, acting, soundtrack, and pacing of the story were all very good... I would have scripted the final 15 minutes differently, but it still worked in the scheme of the plot and the motivations of the main characters. Millie Bobby Brown is a great young actor and is again the corner stone of this film. A new take on a classic, just enjoy it for what we enjoy films for... A fun, engaging story...",Enola Holmes

314,tomarm-21596,"Boring, incomprehensible woke fantasy",4,24 December 2020,"An uninteresting story, to the extent that anyone can, or wants to, understand it. But that's what happens when your real priority is to be a feminist statement. Has great production values, in recreating turn of the century England. And, of course, there's about zero effort in trying reflect how people and life were then, instead relying on 1920 woke ideals and caricatures.A big theme is the woman's suffrage movement, and the mom's disappearing regarding (and where she gives a totally incomprehensible explanation). It's no coincidence that this movement followed the industrial revolution, as that is created more options in society for people, and most particularly for women. The ""white males bad"" theme as shown in the move, seems to ignore, or is ignorant of, the fact that men created the Industrial Revolution, thus facilitating women's greatly increased options including giving rise to woman's suffrage (""we're all in this together"" as the saying goes)",Enola Holmes

317,mr-whyte,For children.. predictable yet amusing,6,2 October 2020,No spoilers here. If you are twelve you might enjoy this. If you are older you might be amused. Far from great. Very predictable. Well made and acted. Although Sherlock didn't feel like a Sherlock.,Enola Holmes
318,Rishav1987365,Holmes to the Rescue,8,6 October 2020,"It is set in the background of early 1880s in England.
It starts when Enola Holmes , Sherlock's teen sister-discovers her mother missing, she sets off to find her, becoming a super-sleuth in her own right as she outwits her famous brother and unravels a dangerous conspiracy around a mysterious young Lord.
In my opinion Mille Bobby Brown is excellent, Sam Claflin is extraordinary and Henry Cavil is being Henry Cavil. The Production is great, the story is heart warming but the mystery is not to much.See the spin off with Henry Cavil as Sherlock Holmes is a mind blown. These universes of Sherlock is going wider and wider with each actor setting a different image as Sherlock. Where Benedict Cumberbatch sets a sly and mindful sherlock, more wit and less physical strength. Well Ferrell sets a more comic yet witty Sherlock. Robert Downey Jr. is more like a mastermind sherlock with both physical strength and wits but lack the British touch in his accent.
Taking things back to Enola Holmes, portraited by Millie Bobby Brown, is a delight to watch as she is young, goregous and talented. Her womenly appeal is depected more in this movie which was lacking in her appearance in Stranger Things.
Taking about the plot, direction ,set build-up it was a very beautifully done.
Overall I would like to conclude this video by saying. Its not something new you'll see but it will be worth your while.

322,JohnVerset,A strikingly adventurous and exciting film,7,28 September 2020,"Even though the character of Sherlock was peculiar, the journey of Enola Holmes was rather adventurous and exciting to watch. I was not able to let my eyes go astray from the screen. The narrations of Enola Holmes (Millie Bobby Brown) was nice. It kept the movie (mildly) humorous, not that it was not without them. Millie Bobby Brown always kept the excitement alive, not to mention Sam Claflin was great (but hilarious). The lifestyle, the lovely hobbies, the magnificent (and also callous) conventions of the Victorians were unveiled finely enough for a 2h 3m long movie. I absolutely loved the movie.",Enola Holmes

But for the love of god stop talking to the camera or the audience it has no place in a film it was disturbing enough in Miranda.Really it's a film for 11/12 year olds as an adult I found totally incomparable to the Cumberbatch show or the RDJ movies it all too nice.,Enola Holmes

326,davidjaldred,"No sex, no double entendres, just adventure!",8,25 October 2020,"Millie Bobby Brown was fabulous from start to finish. For a while there I worried that her speaking to camera, ""breaking the 4th wall"", would get annoying but quite the reverse: this young actor has such an engaging personality that when she did speak to us (exemplar: the water butt!) she really kept me hooked, and anyway, that technique never took over the narrative style, and in fact seemed to take a back-seat in the second half. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. What a marvellously refreshing change from the usual cynical fare (much of which I also enjoy!) that seems to inhabit our screens. This reminded me, in a way, of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, in its wide-eyed, simplistic view of the world: yes, there was intrigue, yes there were bad people, and there certainly was danger - but only the really caricatured bad people di (and I think only on person actually dies in the whole film - but don't quote me on that), which is fine (in a movie!) This is a movie that anyone can watch, whether they're young or old. I hope there will be more!",Enola Holmes

328,star_hazard,Quirky and fun,8,29 September 2020,Don't look for the real Sherlock here or you will be disappointed. Just watch this like how Riverdale took the names of the characters but not the character themselves. Overall this is more like a kiddy quirky version with just a touch of Sherlock. The direction reminds me of Eloise Disney movies. It has the same vibe.A lot of the low reviews lament on the historical accuracy which I think you should take with a grain of salt. History is not the main thing here. It's not a documentary at all. This is simply the adventure of a girl finding herself which just happened to be in the 19th century. I think they put enough of the real society for it to work.I didn't really see any problem with the feminism in here as well.. it's not even in your face like other movies. It's just a woman's POV...Enola's POV so of course the rest of the cast will take a back seat to which if you have a problem with... I suggest you don't watch this or you'll just be disappointed.There's a lot of little plots happening in the background (could be a hodge-podge and convoluted for some) but for me it works because it's not about them but Enola. I'm watching Enola weave through all the plot points and choose which path to take.It's not perfect by any means. I'm rating the plot a 6 but giving it an overall 8 because I love the casts and it made me feel happy because it was an easy watch quirky film.,Enola Holmes

The story was compelling and well written, the costumes were spot on, the acting was perfection, and to see beautiful England, well what more can one ask?! The overall settings and historical references were just delicious. Cinematography was clean and beautiful. We enjoyed the movie for all this but truely it was just a fun soft mystery without profanity, harsh bloodshed or distressing scenes. A relaxing and entertaining fare. What a joy. There were some stretches of reality, but so what? They added to the film. It is a keeper and I hope they make more of the Enola Holmes tales.",Enola Holmes

The brains behind this should have thought this through a little more because it wasn't as smart as we excpect the Holmes to be. Then again, if it's meant for 12 year olds, then maybe they aren't as critical as more grown ups are...",Enola Holmes

334,njboden,'Viscount Tooksbury' Indeed!,5,11 October 2020,"It really grates on me that Enola keeps referring to 'The Viscount of Tewkesbury, Marquis of Basilwether' as 'Tooksbury' for 2 reasons. Firstly, it should be 'The Marquis of Basilwether, Viscount of Tewkesbury', which should be shortened to 'Basilwether'; secondly, it should be pronounced 'Tyooksbury' in any case. No upper class English person would say that today, still less in the 19th century, but the actress who plays Enola has an Americanised pronunciation on some words despite being English. I read the comments and didn't see this mentioned once but thankfully someone noticed the incorrect form of address, though not the pronunciation, and listed it in the 'goofs' section.Other than that, the film is untrue to the books, ahistorical, unfocused and with an anti-man bias in myriad ways that I don't have the time or inclination to enumerate and explain but have been aptly detailed by other commenters. It's a shame as he film is quirky and enjoyable in places, such as when Enola is riding the penny farthing in the beginning, and would be improved with a better plot and dialogue and a 'show, don't tell' approach.",Enola Holmes

Movie is beautifully set and quintessentially English. I could actually see two sequels but separate. Cavill as Sherlock with Clafin as Mycroft in a more adult type film. Brown and Partridge in there own more family orientated movie like this one.The bad. Plot gets lost somewhat, it should probably have been about Brown looking for her mum and unpicking that story more comprehensively or about the Partridge family mystery (not that Partridge family ;) ). In the end I think the film tries to cram in a bit much and the film Is therefore 30 minutes too long, for me anyway.All in all though solid effort and the talent of MBB is incredible for someone so young, she is sure to be a star for many years to come. And to those moaning about feminism perhaps you need to reevaluate your own beliefs on women in film and instead embrace the talent on offer regardless of gender.

341,Tony_Fresh_Reviews,This might be the most jacked Sherlock Holmes has ever been.,5,24 September 2020,"This movie had so much potential, but it was completely average. For everything that I liked, there was something I didn't. Enola Holmes, played by Millie Bobby Brown, was excellent. She was tenacious, likable, empowering, and quick-witted. Henry Cavill as a super-jacked Sherlock Holmes was incredible and I wanted more. Ultimately, the best part of this movie is the Holmes family.It's when we draw our focus elsewhere do we run into problems. What I thought would be a fun adventure of a daughter finding her missing mother turned into some Disney Channel love story. We focus too much time on Enola and Lord Farquaad (or whatever his name was), which slows this movie down to an agonizing drag. The movie is largely unfocused spending more time beating you over the head with its message than writing a compelling or coherent story. It's a movie you shouldn't think too hard about, but considering its source material, you would think the writing would have been more clever. If not for the amazing cast, this movie would have been a chore to get through.Score: 5 out of 10
Overall: AverageRecommended for: Fans of Millie Bobby Brown, fans of Disney Channel movies, or fans of a suave Henry Cavill playing World's Greatest Detective.",Enola Holmes
342,b-96875,Enola Holmes,6,1 October 2020,"Enola Holmes is a fairly enjoyable film starring Milly Bobby Brown as the titular character, with Henry Cavill in a strong supporting role and a vibrant colour palette along with some relatively tight direction from Henry Bradbeer. However, there are some glaring problems with Enola Holmes that prevented me from enjoying it more.As I remember, Mycroft Holmes has always been portrayed as Sherlocks cynical brother but always one that has the welfare of the Holmes' at heart. In Enola Holmes, Sam Claflin portrays Mycroft (through no fault of his own I may add) as essentially the antagonist of the film, completely overshadowing Frances De La Tour as the real antagonist. There are no likeable character traits to get behind or make you feel as if Mycroft is there as anything other than a generally unsavoury individual. I've not read the Enola Holmes books so I can't say whether this is as a result of the source material, but treating the character like this affords him very little justice.I don't understand the necessity of this film to begin with, or what it's target audience is supposed to be. Any real sense of mystery and intrigue is lacking. The supporting cast feel like exactly that; aside from Sherlock, characters such as Tewkesbury, Mycroft and the Dowager are not allowed any real screen time to develop or get behind as this is all about displaying Millie Bobby Brown's capabilities as an up and coming actress. That's fine in a TV series, but it doesn't lend itself too well to a two hour long feature.",Enola Holmes

345,vandykeu,A fun movie,8,26 September 2020,"Don't let the bad reviews put you off this one. It's a fun movie, mainly about two young people figuring out who they are and what they want in life (primarily Enola, but I found Tewkesbury's journey interesting as well). The movie has a couple of strong inspirational messages:1) Don't let anyone but you decide how to live your life, no matter who you are.
2) Don't let your own expectations blind you to what is true, or right.Is it perfectly historical? Probably not, but I think it would be daft to assume that young women (and young men) didn't find themselves chafing under the expectations that have been laid out for them. Heck, they STILL DO in our modern age. And that's the real value of movies, and, more broadly, stories like this. 'That's just the way things are' is never sufficient reason to go along with how you are expected to live. We should always challenge such things in the name of equality and righteousness.",Enola Holmes

Cast - Millie Bobby Brown, Louis Partridge, Henry CavillI started this movie with so much hype but I was somewhat disappointed. I thought this is a sequel or prequel of the ""Sherlock"" series. But it has a different story plot and the story was changed a lot. It seemed like a new storyline of sherlock for me. I only liked the acting of the main protagonist. But Henry Cavill was disappointing as Sherlock Holmes. The story was not that much interesting and plot twists were so rare. Enola who was brought up by only her mother was alone after suddenly her mother vanished. She went on a journey of finding her mother and found out her mother is a rebel and on a secret mission. In Enola's journey, she fell in love with a boy from a renowned family for no reason. Her main mission became to save that boy. Action scenes of this movie were boring and no thrill at all. A hopeless movie for me. I guess this movie is for children. Though only positive thing about this movie is the cinematography.Personal Rating - 4/10",Enola Holmes
348,runcap,"So many miscast characters, places and times...meh meh and meh",3,26 May 2021,"Poser Sherlock Holmes (Henry Cavill ) is played like an aloof GQ model waiting for his next gig..His uptight pipe smoking brother Mycroft Holmes(Sam Claflin) plays the true Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's gentleman . The poser pretty boy Sherlock Holmes needed to trade places with the square Mycroft Holmes.Also, there's so much unnecessary wokeness it's very distracting. It's like playing where's Waldo when I watched the London streets scenes . I was half expecting to see Greta Thunberg braying like a wild banshee at the front of woke mob marching on Buckingham Palace.Also 1908 London is very diversified, good for whatever message that may imply... but it takes me out of the historical moment.Some of the woke characters look and act like they took a time machine from hipster London or Los Angeles to prudish Victorian England ,the Victorian locals did not notice the alternate reality I wouldn't have been surprised if a Starbucks was inserted in the CGI scenery.I really wanted the real Sherlock Holmes to solve that mystery.Enola's kooky mother (Helena Bonham Carter) comes across as a women's suffrage movement terrorist leading a pack of angry women that want to blow up half of London for the cause...jeez dial that one back script writers.Victorian ladies going all out Kamikaze for the right to vote, last thing London needs is more bomb violence...it really was a distasteful script ploy. Revolutionary feminist women planning on murdering police, government officials and innocent bystanders with pipe bombs with Enola hot on the trail looking for her wayward mum that was never flushed out the story arch just petered out .At about this time so did I...
I bailed from Enola while my ten year old niece continued watching with rapt attention. She really enjoyed the scatterbrained story with teen Nickelodeon romance thrown in for good measure.As not to be a complete bore.......Young girls will like Millie Bobby Brown playing Enola, she does a charming girl power characterization .She reminds me of a Plain Jane Keira Knightley and I'm sure she has years of Hollywood stardom ahead.CGI was good as always.",Enola Holmes

350,schak23,ignore a few things and enjoy,6,29 October 2020,"Millie Bobby Brown, along with a really nice cast, is quite charming and drives this story well. Breaking the wall to the audience creates a welcome distraction and adds to the quirky fun you will have with this film. Because the film is fun at most times, if you manage to ignore some plot elements which just seem superficially thought through and so many inaccuracies about the period. One thing that I find striking is that Netflix seems to follow a certain diversity policy about casting. Making sure to show as many as possible people with non-white ethnic backgrounds in a Victorian setting is plainly silly though. Politically this works for me being a firm believer in equal opportunities, but in art? Would you make a film about Malcolm X with a lot of white guys around the main character? So, why does Lestrade for instance now have to have a different ethnic background? Yes, it is fantasy, so why bother you might ask. Rightly so, ignore it. In the meantime I will dream of a world, where the colour of your skin, your gender and background really does not matter.",Enola Holmes

The second half was better, as I understood more about the big picture so I kind of expected how things would turn out and see if I was right. So plot wise, could have been clearer. I don't know what else to say, as this movie packs various themes. Family, romance, detective, girl power. It felt complicated at times. But yeah, it is a nice movie to watch.",Enola Holmes

To be honest, I don't like the set up of talking to the audience or breaking the fourth wall as they say. So I was already annoyed watching this. Secondly screenplay is horribly written. To be fair, I have not read the books so I can not judge the original content this is based on. But I can say the execution and direction is a huge mess.

354,eeriechills,Millie Bobby brown Noooooooooooo,4,17 October 2020,I was sceptical with a classic name like Sherlock Holmes being retold from a different angle. With bad press in the press on Millie Bobby Brown due to her sexualizing demeanour (not my words) I didn't think the casting was great. Henry cavill steals the film and perhaps a re telling of Sherlock with him at the helm alone would've been a better angle. You get the impression that Millie was trying to emulate Natalie Portman. I'm just not a fan of Hollywood etc vearing off course with classic novels.,Enola Holmes
355,jonesaby,A complete misfire... For me...,5,3 October 2020,"I am that guy whose mind lights up with Robert Downey Jr and Benedict Cumberbatch the moment the name Sherlock pops up. So when a movie comes up related to Sherlock, the expectations are high and kind of... specific. And hence Enola holmes have been a complete disappointment for me.Before I complain more about the movie, I must first appreciate Millie Brown. Her vibrant presence was the highlight of the movie unopposed. Really impressed with her and I look forward for her further movies.Now my complaints, I shall start with the weak plot. So weak that it never got me intrigued. Sometimes you even wonder why there is Sherlock which comes to my next disappointment, Sherlock.Is it wrong to be excited to see some of Sherlock's detective skills and when you make such a movie you are supposed to provide the audience with as much deductions as possible. Here is a Sherlock who comes up with some conclusion after the viewers are provided with the knowledge and that too with some poor little deductions.Henry Cavill... Big fan of his Witcher and Superman... But Sherlock??? I really doubt this was his role. I get Sherlock is emotion less but that doesn't mean he is expressionless... Right?",Enola Holmes
356,sinahaase-960-743497,So much potential yes so disappointed.,5,23 September 2020,"I had such high hopes for this Netflix film. I didn't read the info really I just saw the trailer and for some reason I thought it was going to be a series and then I realized it was a film once it started but still in the beginning I was so eager to finish it thinking that it was going to be great! Sadly it is nothing comparable to any Sherlock versions I have seen. As a feminist myself I was actually intrigued to see where they were going to go with their storyline once it had come into place, but it was just so bad! There was no capturing component about her deductions as some type of female detective and they had every chance to make it that way hello? She is Sherlocks sister and she's supposed to be smart and and witty because of her mothers teaching but it focus so much more on physical fighting rather than her intelligence in solving a mystery. Sherlocks character was ridiculous and he made me cringe I can't believe they chose him and his lies were so dumb And in no way add a Sherlock level more of just a normal detective. I'm pretty sure they just chose him because he is handsome which is really Innoway contradictory towards the feminist way my biggest complaint was the ending result the entire time she is looking for her mother right? In fact that was in the trailer and it is the main plot of the movie besides a boy that she randomly met and fell in love within 10 seconds.And yet she never solved the mystery of where her mother was her mother just appeared somehow knowing where she was in a random hotel room and was there to find her she did not find her mother and it was so disappointing as a film. There was so much potential having Millie Bobby Brown as the main character as well as other supporting roles including Helena Bonham Carter and yet it was a complete failure! Included in that level of potential I didn't think the feminist line was so bad. In fact I thought it had an awesome creative framework to put in a great film and like I keep saying I was very disappointed.",Enola Holmes
357,carinnalowther,I wish it hadn't been Holmes,6,1 October 2020,"I really like the character of Enola, and her journey.
However they painted sherlock as an ignorant dullard, which I dont appreciate.What Hollywood hasn't seemed to grasp is that Feminism means equality, not superiority. You dont need to dumb down Sherlock to make Enola a cool character. By doing so you are saying that you had to make a male character less than so that the female character can be on equal footing. That defeats the whole message.",Enola Holmes

An edgy female character ahead of her time related to an already well known and liked famous detective Sherlock Holme. The problem is there is nothing here that sets it apart and makes it original, even the mystery seems very predictable. Sure, there are some fun parts and Millie does a fine enough job as Enola Holmes, as did they rest of the cast.

Tha girl doesn't fit, maybe it's the actress, maybe the way she is written, it just doesn't fit.Good job by ither actors especially the PC Gamer.Also, didn't like the cheap tactics if it trying to employ that it's good because there is Holmes. Unnecessary nodtalgi to Sherlock stories.Also, the girls keeps forgetting how good she is at jujitsu and what not at plot convenient timings. Why couldn't she escape with the little boy through the window if she was so sharp. I mean a bed was nearby, a stick anything's could have hold the door.Unnecessary plot of womenhood.

Not sure breaking the wall is sustainable, maybe less of that in future, or limit it to the opening of each instalment. And MBB would be a tad more effective with a tad of snark. Rathbone, the best of them in Holmes series, didn't suffer fools. He might have gone a bit too far with that at times, but MBB could do with a bit more of it, without sacrificing the kind-heartedness by which she brings something new, refreshing and delightful to the Holmes genre.",Enola Holmes

I'm a grown woman, grew up in the 60's and 70's, and I'm criticizing it. The new world order is to portray all (or even the majority of) men as controlling towards women and girls, which is simply not the truth. It hurts to see society is swallowing this load of crap hook line and sinker. To be told you need to be empowered is to take away the power you already have.",Enola Holmes
368,benmundie,Enjoyable but Nothing Special!,7,15 October 2020,"'Enola Holmes' is a fun adventure picture which is full of an empowering feminist message. The acting is fantastic with the standouts being Millie Bobby Brown as the titular character, Henry Cavill as 'Sherlock Holmes' and Sam Claflin as 'Mycroft Holmes'. The writing is endearing and suits the story they're telling and how they're portraying the legendary Sherlock Holmes. Henry Cavill brings something new to the role in the most recent adaption of the famous character. The story has obvious direction with Enola searching for her mother, Eudoria, (Helen Bonham Carter). With multiple twists involved which don't always land but do for the most part. The film paints a picture where Enola is the heroine, then convinces younger viewers that she doesn't need to be constrained by the rules of her family. The relationship between Enola and Tewksbury seems realistic and they bounce off each other well. However, the film isn't perfect, the comedy doesn't always land and seems quite forced at times. The emotional scenes, especially at the end between the main protagonist and her mother, lack logic and it feels like we missed a pivotal scene at the end. In the middle of the second act the story drags as they take Enola out of her quest to put her into a random side story. Some aspects of the world are incredibly unrealistic, in particular, when Linthorn (Burn Gorman) survives despite being in the centre of a massive explosion.
Overall, the acting really carries the film and Millie Bobby Brown is perfect in the role. This is an enjoyable flick for people that have a free two hours.",Enola Holmes

The film on the other hand, although I gave it a 7, it felt like something was missing. It was definitely too long. The 4th wall breaking felt really off, a strange choice. There were some rather farfetched moments, she definitely should've died at one point.... The main plot point felt like a bit of a cop out in the end unfortunately.

Ok, too right....... it is just a bloody movie!!!!

You'll absolutely love it, unless you're a Sherlock Holmes fan, then it quickly looses its charms. They basically change every character completely to fit the story, rendering them unrecognisable. But, it's made for young teen girls and they will love it. I should also add, that Henry Cavill is one of the worst Sherlock Holmes, I've ever seen. I genuinely like him as an actor, but in this case I think he was terribly miscast.If you love Sherlock Holmes, you won't love this... but if you don't care about Holmes you'll have a great time.",Enola Holmes
375,SB100,Lots of action,6,27 September 2020,"I would call myself something of a Sherlockian but was not offended by this definitely non-canonical film wherein Sherlock's younger sister shows that she is also possessed of detective skills. And she shows other skills which her brother also has, being very good in a fight. The plotline, revolving around a young lord and a fictitious reform bill, and Enola's revolutionary mother, is as thin as paper, and also contains a lot of holes.
But no matter, our heroine is always dashing somewhere to find something. Most men come off badly, although there is a spark of sympathy between Enola and Sherlock. Some reviewers here have complained about feminism being shoved down the viewer's throat, but this period between 1890 and 1914 was very much the first wave of feminism and Enola's mother is not a particularly unlikely figure in her attitudes.
I found the lead actress hard to hear at times. Henry Carvill was by no means the worst Holmes I have seen.",Enola Holmes

The movie is available in Hindi as well.Enola Holmes is a fresh take on Sherlock's legacy and Bobby managed to leave her stamp on this Baker Street. I truly believe that this movie will help Netflix to have an entertaining franchise in the movie category. Something that they don't have it. Plus, this movie will help to get a lot of attention from the young audience towards the Sherlock saga and that my friend is a good thing.She enjoyed her role and that truly reflects in her act. I can not say that Henry as he did not leave a strong impression as the new Sherlock Holmes. He is emotional, caring, and did not display any sign or a glimpse of a mad man that Sherlock is famous for.Elona is the star here and her interaction with us while breaking the fourth wall is a delight to watch. The movie has a diverse star cast where Susie Wokoma is damn impressive. Just two scenes but you will remember her.The story is simple and effective.

She made the role really fun to watch. It'd be a great entertainer watch this with kids. I had to rate it 10 because the average rating needs to be higher than 6.7 . And one more thing is that it's a story about Enola Holmes, not about Sherlock Holmes, so expecting the same amount of thrill what we got from watching Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock wouldn't be appropriate.",Enola Holmes

This time, Enola Holmes is the main protagonist and Millie Bobby Brown did a commendable portayal and the impressive thing is she also produced the movie at the age of only 16. The dress and costume designs in the movie are topnotch, and I won't be surprised if it gets a nod at the Academy Awards. The production design is another addition to the beauty, which made the 1884 London looks more real and alive. The pacing is kinda slow that you could get bored during the first quarter but the certainty is it was worth the patience. The storyline is charming and the color grading makes you feel adventurous. One of the few flaws I've notice is the visual effects. They're look so animated and that's a bit terrible and disappointing considering the production designer did a good job in representing the setting. Another thing is the ""breaking the fourth wall"" concept. It kinda looks non-sense and uninteresting. Still, ""Enola Holmes"" is a nice movie and you'll forget the shortcomings once you get hooked to the beauty of it.",Enola Holmes

Reminds me so much of ""Young Sherlock Holmes"" as they are both adventure mysteries energized with protagonists who are in their teens. Very much like the Nancy Drew series. The catch for this one is it introduces Sherlock Holmes' younger sister Enola Holmes as the central character. It makes perfect sense because the intrigue for this one involves the emancipation of the fairer sex. The cinematography is scrumptious, and so were the trappings that came with the period. For me, the true delight was in watching both Millie Bobby Brown and Louis Partridge, who are the perfect toppings for this package. The only quibble I have is the over usage of talking to the audience, the ""second person narrator"" device which can be gimmicky and annoying sometimes.",Enola Holmes

The plot is all over the place.The main character verges on being a ""perfect, but boring"" character. Why are male characters belittled in order to elevate the female ones? Just write them all better instead of doing it this lazy way.Events happen in ways that dont make sense and for no reason other than that the plot demands it.I know this isn't a historical drama and I'm ok to suspend disbelief with a bit of artistic license, but the historical inaccuracies going on are so glaring it removes the viewer from the story entirely. It is made so much worse by sticking ""modern-acting"" characters in a society where such acts would be so out of place.Nothing wrong with a theme of feminism, but it is poor writing to shove the theme in our face every minute.

390,markbarner,Well played,6,24 September 2020,"It always pleases me to watch a well written story. Although it was a bit predictable it had many good moments due to the lead role as she is so very talented. Sometimes there was a bit overacting or let's call it a little too much child-action when it was overly dramatic for no reason.
I was very entertained and I loved how the story unfolded but the where some corrections to be made if you ask me.The scene where she fights the killer for the first time, she was almost waiting and being extra slow in the whole scene and he could have killed her many times realistically. Also he stabs her and they both very veeeery slowly just stands there.
We never see or hear the story or at least sees some scars on the killers face after the explosion.
When she fails at fighting him she takes long breaks where as if her mother taught her that she should be quick and no that hesitant.The scene where she and the boy runs from mycrafts detective and barricades themselves in the room makes no sense as she doesn't fight him to avoid being caught. She herself could at least tried to escape or gotten revenge on the woman that ratted on her. Makes no sense to give herself up.
Also shortly after she gives mycroft all her money instead of just keeping a little bit herself. Or not just cry when he yells at her.At the school she doesn't try to escape earlier. Makes me puzzle like she wanted to stay.When she finds the boy in the flower market it's not like they are trying to hide or run even though they talk about being in great danger. Puzzles me.When they steal the car our lead role yells the boy in his face about why they should go to his estate and examine the situation. While she yells it turns into a very odd scene as she looks at him for a very very long time!?When they examine the boys estate they drive there in a noisy car parking it close and the later say ""they know we are here""... how would they know first of all that you would arrive by car!!!?When the boy is shot she literally waits until the grandmother shoots her!! Why!? No running from an old woman. They had all the time in the world. The boy had no chance of knowing if the grandmother would shoot him in the face or legs or so or if she would miss... makes no sense that he care free let's her shoot him! Just bad direction as many other times.There where a few more moments that just got me out of the movie cringing over how a scene failed. But with the lead roles and the quality of acting and the well spoken dialects it pulled me in again. Luckily.I would wish that Scherlock Holmes would have been a more interesting character. He was very silent and boring the entire movie. Not as smart as he was supposed to be. The fact that he was so slow kinda made it nonsense that he would be this famous in the movie. Just felt off to silence the role and not make a bigger character out of him. A character to look up to or to at least have weirded us out a bit. But no.All in all I enjoyed it though cursing at some scenes didn't help haha.",Enola Holmes

The setting of the English countryside and the rendering of industrial era London was pretty cool as well.While the acting was pretty good, the writing and plot direction was jumbled.Enola is trying to find her mother, save a boy she met along the way, escape her brothers' grip, and find her calling all in the same movie. This of course leads to lots of rushed scenes and unanswered questions.Some questions I had were:How did the man in the bowler hat find Enola? How did he know Enola and Tewkesbury were going to confront Tewkesbury's uncle? Why was Tewkesbury's vote on the Reform Bill so important? What happened with the mother's feminist group? How did Sherlock solve the case? (they show you, but it wasn't very convincing.)If you dissect the movie (like I did) it loses it's luster, but that's no excuse for lazy writing and a weak plot.

It had its moments, but lacked what you may expect (I.e. engaging mysteries and Sherlock Holmes). Instead, it relied HEAVILY on a feminist narrative. As films continually slide deeper and deeper into PC (politically correct) territory, we lose promising films to narratives that fit the agenda. This movie wasn't subtle in its attempt to paint every male character as weak, stupid and wholly useless. However, the cherry on top is Enola's mother building bombs for a plot to commit violent acts in the name of reform. This film condones this and pushes change at all costs. The end result is a story saturated with biast and a far left agenda.Keep Sherlock Holmes out of it and leave us our favorite stories free of politics and cloaked extremism.

The highlights: Millie Bobby Brown is simply outstanding, Helena Bonham Carter wins the award for being the first SMILF (Sherlocks Mother etc etc) and puts in a stellar performance, Louis Partridge as the gender reversed coquettish ingenue is very watchable. Henry Cavill and Sam Clafin as Sherlock and Mycroft leave you just wanting more. In fact the whole cast is great.

402,blatherskitenoir,"Good for a younger audience, but parents may want to preview it",6,28 September 2020,"For the most part, it is a delightful, breezy period mystery for younger viewers with a just right amount of quirk and action, though it goes a bit long. The Stranger Things girl is funny and bright, and very, very purposefully styled to imitate Kiera Knightley, which is interesting to watch.Unfortunately, its feminist/privilege wokeness messages get crammed down your throat until you start feeling like a pate goose, while still playing the sHE's Not LikE OTheR gIrLs! card and heavily implying feminine women are bad and betraying their gender. Which is tiresome.But the true impediment to greatness will be its innaccuracies. Sherlock fans are rabid and dedicated. They will notice and take offense when the characters do things like TALK in the Diogenes club or say Mycroft is jealous for being the stupid one, which is honestly so bizarre, it does not compute. They'll also notice she can't deduce like Sherlock (she's definitely smart, but can make obvious logical conclusions and solve word puzzles at best) and largely blunders into answers.The historical innaccuracies are also very annoying. The jiu-jitsu class is fine, but she runs around offering poor people the modern equivalent of $800+ usd to swap clothes with her, instead of, you know, buying them for significantly less from a store. With her hair down, which only hookers or crazy people did. And includes the obligatory ""corsets bad!"" commentary, which made my eye twitch.Overall, I'm going to say this would be a good film for pre tweens to early teens who aren't super Sherlock fans, but in the mood for a ""I am finding myself, hear me roar"" bit of character development in their Netflix pick.Adult history or Sherlock buffs who get nitpicky about details will go spare and should skip it for the sake of the little vein in their forehead.Why a parent may want to preview it: for a small section, they strongly imply that domestic terrorism bombings are a viable tool for social and political activism, though more peaceful, cerebral methods win the day and no political bombings take place. Your younger kid may not notice it, but it is there.",Enola Holmes

As an adult I would score it a 3, but I don't want to be harsh as, I at least think, 16 year old should find it entertaining enough, although its at least 30 min to long.

407,gpcheng87,"Not bad for younger audience; simple, fun viewing.",6,27 September 2020,"Suffragettes and feminism, a female mind as sharp and tenacious as a man's in a period drama for younger viewers = check. I'm probably too old for this movie, but am a fan of Helena Bonham Carter, Sam Claftin and Burn Gorman. The plot was a bit simple but was still fun and entertaining - my only complaint was how one-dimensional and nasty Mycroft Holmes was depicted. Stephen Fry's Mycroft in ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011)"" was much more complex and likeable since his perculiarities were explained/had backstory. While Claftin did a great job, I don't think the character of Mycroft is supposed to be a baddie/villain - he's supposed to be helpful, a ""life line call"" for Sherlock when he's working on a case. Bottom line: A fun family movie. Enjoy.",Enola Holmes
408,Bonz99,Fun but flawed,6,2 October 2020,"Millie Bobby Brown is the main reason to watch this; she is delightful. Helena Bonham Carter is also quite watchable, but is not a major figure. Other major players were either poorly cast or poorly scripted.Having read the entire Sherlock Holmes oeuvre,Henry Cavill was miscast as Sherlock. His older brother Mycroft, who in the original stories was considered ""Sherlock's smarter brother"", is scripted as a not very bright martinet. In the original stories, Sherlock occasionally goes to Mycroft when badly puzzled. These two poorly done characters cast a pall on the movie.Similarly, the character of Adeel Akhtar as Lestrade was poorly written. Although the original Lestrade was competitive with Sherlock, he also consulted with him frequently and was a serious Scotland Yard detective, not a somewhat frenetic boob as in this movie.If you have read the original Sherlock Holmes books, you will be disappointed by these characterizations. Nevertheless, Millie Bobby Brown is a treat worth watching.",Enola Holmes

414,Sickpuppy365,Enola was just a Millie-cent bystander,6,14 October 2020,"It became painfully obvious early on in the film that I am not in the target audience age range... And possibly also not in the gender range...
Never-the-less, I approached it with as open a mind as someone who has read all of Sir A.C. D's books, and who has also seen far too many man-bashing reboots of late.
Millie Bobby Brown is absolutely charming as always thus far in her burgeoning career, conveying Enola's sassy, and resolute character with aplomb.
All the older folk played their parts competently, even if some (looking at you Cavill) raised the rebuffing ire of all the die-hard S. Holmes fan(atic)s
I'm pretty glad they didn't write Enola's character as an African-American/ Asian lesbian transgender Muslim velociraptor as is the current trend in Hollywood... I think it's enough that she's just a strong young girl trying to figure out who she is and at the same time escape the shadows of her big brothers... So hopefully future installments in this possible franchise will concentrate on developing Enola's deductive skills, giving her more challenging cases to solve and fleshing-out her character arc... Without selling out to the genocidal gender crusade I'm expecting.
I will watch this space with an wary eye for further installments...",Enola Holmes

416,Mlle_Chouette,An entertaining movie but not much more than that,7,23 September 2020,"As someone who read and loved the original books, I was quite excited about this movie. And I can't say that I was disappointed, it's still entertaining and interesting to watch, but (hate to say it) the book was better.What I liked: the breaking of the forth wall was a really nice way to present the thoughts of Enola; Millie Bobby Brown's acting; the way it's shot; the intrigue and the mystery (although it could be done a bit better): some plot changes were really cleverWhat I didn't like: Enola is a strong woman herself, she doesn't need a romance or the feminists as a subplot. I mean from the books you get the idea given the context and the facts, but it's subtle and you still get the idea. Also some of the changes that were made for it are the same that repulsed some of the people in the comment section. And some of the things are a bit annoying for a period movie.
Also, as someone else said in the comments: Henry Cavill looks like a Superman in a suit instead of Sherlock Holmes.All in all, don't let all the 1* reviews push you away from it. I don't know how one can imagine a movie about a girl like this, like you see in a trailer, not to be feminist and expect it to be centered about Sherlock. It's a fun and nice flick, based on books for teenagers, not for middle-aged men. It still has action, mystery, wit.7/10*",Enola Holmes

421,spear88,Great Fun,8,25 September 2020,Enola Holmes is a fun movie from beginning to end. There were elements of drama and comedy sprinkled throughout and a rather stacked cast was headed by the magnificent Millie Bobby Brown. This movie only highlights that she is going to be a megastar within the film and television industry for decades to come. The only real cirticism I have is that the ending was rather abrupt. The storytelling was very intricate and layered throughout and everything just kind of came to an abrupt finale which seemed out of sorts with the rest of the film. Initially I was thinking they were setting up for a sequel and I wouldn't have been mad about that if they had but instead everything just concluded. Would highly recommend!!,Enola Holmes
422,revchristodd,Perfectly Enjoyable YA Adventure,8,24 September 2020,"Some of the reviewers here seem to be under the impression that this is a Sherlock Holmes story. It is not. It is about a hitherto unknown teenage sister of his, and the tone is a bit more like ""Young Sherlock Holmes"" than ""The Hound of the Baskervilles."" It is a YA adventure about a girl searching for her identity while avoiding the normal fate of a young woman in Victorian England. While evading her brothers Mycroft and Sherlock, Enola Holmes stumbles across a missing viscount and is torn between solving his mystery and that of her vanished mother. Millie Bobbie Brown carries the film well and Henry Clavell appears just often enough to remind us of Sherlock's connection with Enola. There is little true deduction but some word puzzles and a brisk enough pace to keep the kids interested. It's a fun evening's entertainment for the whole family.",Enola Holmes
423,Syakirin-Ghazali,Millie Bobby Brown is a superstar,8,1 October 2020,Love Millie Bobby Brown. Feminist agenda in the movie is as clear as a daylight. However it does not seems to be too blatantly obvious or too cringe. Had a similar concept and feel to Little Women and I loved Little Women. Also love how the movie and especially Millie engages with the audience throughout the story whilst not being too carried away. Creative modern tech usage was refreshing and lastly I just love the accent and timeline of the movie.,Enola Holmes
424,Bello-4,Typical YA Movie Save For A Well Known Name...,6,27 September 2020,"While so far as YA movies for television go Enola Holmes (based on a YA book) is an enjoyable film, it would've made an even more enjoyable series. The movie does tell a good story, you can appreciate that Enola is smart and kind of scrappy as opposed to being a well to do girl bumbling through life. Also attention was paid to the time period. What sets this movie apart however is the famous name attached to it, Millie Bobby Brown, which is why anyone cares about this movie and probably why Netflix is even bothering with it. In a world where Sherlock Holmes existed and had a larger family including a brother and a kid sister, the events of Enola Holmes unfold beginning with the disappearance of the Holmes matriarch which doesn't seem to upset either of the two Holmes brothers very much surprisingly. In typical YA fashion things unfold too effortlessly for young Enola and interestingly her primary mystery, that of what has happened to her mother, falls by the way side as she side tracks to help a boy of similar age the mystery surrounding her mother coming back ultimately with an all too neat bow wrapping itself up at the end. I'm sure police departments around the world would appreciate mysteries that just wound themselves up.I had thought that Enola Holmes was a series that Brown had filmed in the off season from Stranger Things and not a singular movie. Truth be know it would've been better as a series allowing for development of all the characters involved which was sorely needed, as well as a more suspenseful mystery with subplots (reference the aforementioned side track and neatly wrapped ending).If you don't mind reaching back in time a little and you can find it, try the series The Adventures of Shirley Holmes from the late 1990's featuring the great grand neice of Sherlock Holmes.",Enola Holmes

When Mycroft decides to enroll Elona in a lady grooming school, she makes a run to find her mother and gets involved in a case concerning a young lord. She goes about deciphering codes that ultimately lead to her mother.This movie is a bit too slow and fails to form a gripping plot. Being a detective movie, there was not much of a mystery to solve either. Just simple code breaking and something which comes mildly close to an adventure. The only good part was Milly Bobby Brown's charming acting skills and of course Helena Bonham Carter. Nothing much to see for Henry Cavill either.

You are not sure at first what direction it is taking, and for that matter what it is talking about, if it is another teenager movie, or even less than that, but then you realise that the movie is actually quite serious.Acting scenography directing camera work all that is really nicely executed setting the right tone all around. The story is simply surprising. The tone of the movie is almost a comedy, but the connections between characters are much deeper. I think that the point in this movie is really not just a nice story it is telling, but establishing a future franchise where each character is properly placed in a nice general architecture for future plots.Really cute and interesting and definitely worth seeing twice.The movie is talking about modern kids growing up quickly just moved into another century, so it is as contemporary as it can be.

I didn't know that Henry Cavill or Helena Bonham Carter was in it, which is a pleasant surprise. The story isn't what you expect it to be, which keeps you on your toes.

451,holyshiteverynamehasbeentaken,"Well,well,what a pleasant surprise",8,22 October 2020,"Well, well, what a pleasant surprise(which means utter gibberish spelled backward).
Honestly, I wasn't expecting something this good. It's not exactly perfect, as there are a few issues with the script that I'll get into detail afterward. The film has some delightful performances, most notably-Enola Holmes herself. Millie Bobbie Brown is enjoying this role, as she delivers dynamic, compelling performance. Her character is well written, which also helps to enhance Millie Bobbie Brown's performance. The fourth-wall-breaking is surprisingly good, as it doesn't feel gimmicky or obnoxious.
Now, let's talk about the major flaw of this film. Ironically, it's also one of the mysteries that Enola Holmes was trying to solve-Her mother's disappearance.
Now, it seems like the film isn't quite interested in this plot, contrary to what the film wants us to think(or not). The characters constantly mention
how they have to ""find their mother."" which is supposed to, I guess, is to make the whole incident more urgent. Unfortunately, the film dumps the entire notion into the bin after the second half, when Enola decides to solve something more intriguing than her mother's disappearance. As a result, this storyline ends hastily and unsatisfyingly. The writers manage to answer none of the problems. Now, this wouldn't be such a big problem if they hadn't written it as one of the primary focuses of the film, but they did write it as one of the main plotlines of the film.
Overall, this film remains quite an enjoyable watch, despite its shortcomings.

It's also got a plot designed for a teenage audience, which really explains why grown men are complaining about its simplicity. But it's a hell of a lot of fun and as a mature, grown man, I enjoyed the hell out of it. Millie is proving herself to be a flexible actor, and her choice of co-stars fleshes out the world nicely.I look forward to seeing more movies. I also would love Netflix to come out with a series.",Enola Holmes
459,riaaw,Totally enjoyed this film,10,23 September 2020,"I was looking on Netflix for something to watch, saw this advertised and thought I'd try it.. I am so glad I watched it.. surprisingly good

461,DonaldWinkler,Very entertaining...,8,13 October 2020,"And after reading that she produced it herself, I am very impressed and happy to dismiss the little flaws here and there as a charming signature of a great and very promising young producer/actress.
Although the excessive talking to the audience did irritate a bit at first, i still found myself enjoying it increasingly more and more as it is very consistent and well placed throughout this ever changing fast paced adventure and because she is pulling it off so exemplary, that it gives the movie a very modern and young appeal while adding a whole set of layers to the way the story is narrated.
A very entertaining and well worth watching piece of British cinema (well almost) and definitely one of the luckier shots in the dark that Netflix has had in the last couple of months (or even years?!).",Enola Holmes
462,santanum-23379,Disappointing one.,4,4 October 2020,"The movie is really dull one, they should not play with the essence of Holmes. Really disappointed to watch the ruining of Holmes value. Why the hell enola was looking at cameras / talking to audience, it's makes me feel like I am watching a school life play.",Enola Holmes
463,kristoffer-46,A great Holmes story!,8,9 October 2020,"Plot:
Enola Holmes set out on a journey to find out what happened to her mother who has gone missing. Her oldest brother Mycroft Holmes have other plans for her however as he wants her to be a proper lady and stop living the ""wild"" lifestyle influenced by their mother. The middle child Sherlock Holmes stands in the middle of his two siblings as he cares for them both, and has never been the best at emotions in general. We follow Enola Holmes on her first adventure on her own as she defies Mycroft and sets out to find her mother, only to come across another mystery who might very well change history itself.
Verdict:
I really do not understand how a movie lover cannot like this movie. If you want to read a proper Sherlock Holmes story then I suggest you turn your screen off and read one of the many stories written by Sir. Arthur Conan Doyle himself. This is not a Sherlock Holmes story. This is another take on the Holmes universe which keeps some characters and adds some other. This is the story about Enola Holmes. It is a mystery story about bravery, differences, society expectations & finding yourself and holding on to who you are. I thought it was a delight to see the Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown as the lead actress in this movie and she made a great and convincing performance as the younger sister of the iconic Mycroft & Sherlock characters. Henry Cavil does a fresh take as now side character Sherlock and speaking of the cast it would be wrong not to acknowledge the actress legend Helen Bonham Carter who plays the role as the mother Eudoria Holmes. Millie Brown & Bonham Carter stole every scene they had together and it was a delight to watch.
I thought this was an exciting, funny and fresh Holmes movie that was entertaining from the beginning to the end.8/10",Enola Holmes

Don't expect a Holmes mystery - just a fun romp through Holmes's London with a good actor playing the lead role.

468,pooz_the_gun,Great idea with an underwhelming execution,6,23 September 2020,"Let me preface this review by saying that this movie has a lot of great things to start a movie with. Namely, it has a great story idea with a nice outline, a really great cast, a nice message and likable characters, except for one for me that was supposed to be likable, being the mother.
However, the main issue with this movie is its pace and at certain points dull story. You just expect more subtlety, mystery and clues from a Sherlock Holmes movie. Instead you get obvious plot twists with a very straight forward story which makes it boring at some spots.
Nice movie to watch once. Had a lot of potential, unfortunately unfulfilled in my opinion.",Enola Holmes

476,WarBerg11,Boring and uneventful,5,28 September 2020,"I expected a mysterious movie full of adventure, but the movie was much more boring than expected. Despite some nice shots of the British countryside or London, the movie just couldn´t hold my attention. Even for teenagers the movie seemed so dull at times. None of the characters were really fleshed out well. And there was some comedy but not enough to entertain. Similair wise, there was some romance, but not enough to become invested in it. Moreover, there was some mystery, but not enough to be carried away with that. You get the point.Overall, I wouldn´t really recommend this movie to anyone. Even not to teenagers.",Enola Holmes

Geralt the Witcher? Sure. Superman? Perfectly capable. He's not a bad actor by any stretch and it honestly isn't even much his fault that he doesn't fit here, but he simply feels miscast. For that, I can completely understand die-hard Sherlock Holmes fans not liking this based off of that alone.That being said, I can't say I wasn't charmed by the quirky nature of this film. I enjoyed Millie Bobby Brown's little asides directed at the viewer. I appreciated that this movie didn't stray too far into woke territory in places where it easily could have. I was able to get past ""historical inaccuracies"" because from the start of this movie, it's not hard to tell that this isn't a film to take all that seriously. If you're not looking for that and you want a more serious Sherlock Holmes film with more emphasis on mystery and intrigue, look elsewhere. But if you want a more lighthearted side journey in the Holmes universe, this movie stands perfectly fine on its own two feet.",Enola Holmes

480,brightest-fairy,Teen girls are smarter than this,6,9 October 2020,"I mean, I get it wasn't made for sherlock Holmes' fans, it's for a younger audience, but the story could have been richer, more complex. A lot of the dialogues were cringy, like those disney tv shows made for 6-12 year olds.
Still, great cast, lovely scenery. Movie made for kids.",Enola Holmes
481,ricaelamae,Passable,5,26 October 2020,"Overall an all right film but not one I think I could describe as good. The brief appearances of canonical Sherlock Holmes characters are fairly interesting in these interpretations but very different from source material and there were a few points that were genuinely amusing.
However the dialogue is often cringy and preachy in places. Brown comes across as pretentious and I honestly found her character rather annoying. I know she's naive but she really makes some terrible decision that often endanger herself and Tewksbury.
The film just glosses over the fact that the Holms mother planned to commit domestic terrorism if a political vote didn't go the way she wanted. A lot of things seem to happen for plot convenience.The 4th wall breaking narration is jarring and out of place in a movie that at least pretends to be set in reality. I say pretends. SPOILERS: Juice Jutsu can allow a smaller opponent to take on a larger one but only briefly, the idea is long enough to get away, it is not effective for a knock down drag out in a back alley. The villain is all about murdering children until he actually has the capability to murder the children when he will pick the slowest possible method for plot convenience. Old plate armor is not sufficient defence against a fairly point blank blast from a shot gun. Even if the pellets don't penetrate, which they probably should, the impact at such close range would still most likely cause significant injury.So the movie requires a fair amount of suspension of disbelief. A passable period piece for young women. Not really enough of the spirit of Sherlock Holmes if that's what you are coming for.",Enola Holmes
482,moonmark-52817,Fun film. Kudos to Millie Bobby Brown!,9,24 September 2020,"Firstly, Millie Bobby Brown is something to be reckoned with. She is very entertaining to watch here. The movie was fun, not too dark and not as politically motivated as some other overly sensitive snowflakes here would have you believe.
It's not meant as any kind of substitute for any previous Sherlock Holmes and shouldn't be compared to them. It is a very good watch and stands alone on it's own merits. I very much look forward to the sequel. Excellent job Millie!",Enola Holmes

485,t-c-redman,"Great fun - give it a go, you won't be disappointed. Deserves a much higher IMDB rating.",9,1 June 2021,"We stumbled on this film on Netflix and were thoroughly entertained. It has a great Harry Potter / Series of Unusual Events vibe to it. Millie Bobby Brown was excellent and carried the film effortlessly. I loved the up to date music juxtaposed with the very detailed styling of costumes and scenery, the fast pace, the asides to the camera and the total lack of pretentiousness .Some reviews seem to get hung up on it not being up to the usual Sherlock Holmes complexity and intrigue, to which I say, why should it? Personally I always find Sherlock Holmes a bit dull and humourless ( give me Poirot any day), so the reason many people seem to give this a low score is probably the very reason why I would give it a high score. I rate it 8 and give it a bonus point to counteract the naysayers.It's not perfect. The ending is a little sudden. And the scene on the tea-room with the jujitsu teacher explaining things to Sherlock Holmes is out of kilter with the rest of the film, both in terms of script and acting style. Also, it was hard to make out what Henry Cavill was saying in his opening scenes. But the minor irritants are more than compensated for by the charm and pitch perfect timing of the rest of the film.If you just want to be entertained for a couple of hours you could do a great deal worse.",Enola Holmes
486,tspike911,"It's wasn't bad, it just lacked a bit",6,18 October 2020,"As I always do, I went into this movie with an open mind with no expectations of greatness or failure. I put aside both extreme ""sides"" of those who have already reviewed the movie. The character Enola showed both sides of what one would expect of most young adults.
Her background was a bit hastily thrown at us but was adequate I think. I understand the climate of today's vision for woman, however it may have been pushed a bit far to suite the period this film was portraying. It wasn't quite to the point of being a distraction, but close.
Granted the story wasn't about ""Sherlock"", but it may have pulled on the coattails of his lineage more than some would care for by nearly rendering his involvement in this film rather inert which will undoubtedly frustrate true Sherlock Holmes fans.
Maybe we have been spoiled by Robert Downey Jr's quick wit and quirkiness as Holmes, because that was indeed lacking in this film. I think it would have been better not to have Sherlock make an appearance at all.",Enola Holmes
487,gtessarini,The smartest sister of Sherlock Holmes,8,30 September 2020,"Enola Holmes, the younger sister of the famous detective Sherlock Holmes is an intrepid protagonist of the new Netflix production that bears his name. Filled with a youthful freshness, the film is capable of bringing us an invigorating version of the fantastic stories of deductions in an older century.Unlike the brilliant and fictional British researcher created in the 19th century by the writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Enola is younger in fiction and in reality. The story that introduces the teenage character to the literature published in 2006 by the American author Nancy Springer.The character's youth in no way detracts from her cleverness. Enola is trained in different fighting styles, versed in various literature, with a spontaneous desire for investigations and for establishing her own free personality. In the story, Enola Holmes has to escape the rigid control and harshness of her older siblings while searching for her mother who has mysteriously disappeared.Getting involved in restrictive issues of social classes and sexism, characteristics of the time when the story takes place, but unfortunately, also today, a character is attracted to a dangerous political plot and to a young and platonic novel.Even though it is a production more geared towards the teen audience, the work pleases different ages with its action-packed narrative, mental and fun exercises that Enola can perform, standing out even his famous older brother, Sherlock Holmes, solving a difficult case before him.Although it diminishes some of its own innovative strength with a youth novel built very quickly - literally, in just a single afternoon, Enola already repeatedly exposes how much the romantic interest grows in her head - mistake and success of many productions in that same style, the film has a very efficient construction.Positive point for the temporal work that works on the pillars of the young character's self-knowledge and the discovery of the vast world that she always read about and prepared to explore, but had never really ventured, although she felt no fear during this adventure dangerous to which it is taken.In the script, in the setting of the scenes and costumes, and especially in the great and energetic performance of Millie Bobby Brown who also produces a work, the Netflix film based on the work of writer Nancy Springer is a plot really worthy of detective stories and with a lot of feminine empowerment, action, fun and current reflections.",Enola Holmes
488,movieturtle2013,It's fairly entertaining,6,23 September 2020,"The movie follows a consistent structure and is very intriguing at some points. The acting is well enough.

489,MovieWatcher2021,Fun movie except too much of political correctnes,4,9 January 2021,"The movie is fun for young adults, it has limited action, limited sex, moderate words, everything good and ok. However, the thing that bugs me the most the latest trend of changing history in the movies/shows to be politically correct and bring in diversity. In that time of the century in England, there is no possibility of having a black woman running any business, let alone Kung Fu school. Also, not good for Holmes fans like me, where Holmes is shown as a conservative prick who would destroy his sister's life rather than help her.Overall, graphics are good, costume and the rest are good. No need to gauge the eyes on the screen, a good side movie while we do other stuff in the house.",Enola Holmes
490,rimagage,Good movie,7,31 May 2021,Good not great but good. If you came because of Henry Cavill and his take on Sherlock Holmes don't bother. His brother Mycroft has more screen time. Plus it's hard to even tell if he had a British accent with how little he was in the film. I understood that Enola was the main character but they shouldn't have bothered with Sherlock. Enola honestly sometimes got on your nerves with the so called puzzles. Main one is that were scrabble pieces honestly could take you years if ever. Plus she kept harping on her name. That was a major deal that didn't serve the plot. Then they tell you this guy Enola meets that doesn't really do anything other than argue over who knows Sherlock more. Turned out he is a fairly important character in the Sherlock Holmes books but not mention by name till the end of the film. There's a minor love story that takes over the main mission to find their mother who went missing. Most of the movie Mycroft is searching for Enola. Sherlock can't be bothered to solve anything till the end after Enola was almost killed solving it herself. Mycroft even asked at one point is he looking for their mother who went missing and Enola. Sherlock claims to be working on it yet walked right by her in disguise. Sherlock might as well only showed up at the end for all the screen time and lousy investigation. The villains found her yet the great detective Sherlock Holmes couldn't.,Enola Holmes

Sort of a Victorian England Nancy Drew.
The supporting cast - Helena Bonham Carter, Henry Cavill, Sam Claflin among others - is wonderful.Really enjoyed the movie's period settings and details and the witty dialogue that was respectful of the era - thankfully not dumbed down with contemporary shallow American-speak.And great music score.My family is baffled by the numerous negative reviews here....

With the lessons that her mother bestowed upon her from a young age, Enola sets out to find her Mother but not before her Brothers, Sherlock and Mycroft, arrive to insist on a different path.

The problem is, this is not a detective story, but an adventure, journey, buddy movie.I also think that the story and the feminist messaging is done very roughly and uncreatively. Partially very cringy stuff.A lot of problems happen with the portrayal of Sherlock. Sherlock would have 1000% recognized Elona at first sight. This was a very stupid thing directly at the start of the movie. Don't get me wrong i love Henry Cavil as Sherlock, but Sherlock is so stupid in this movie!Sometimes Elona breaks the 4th wall. I am not sure why the moviemakers thought this was a great idea, because it wasn't. It really destroys the immersion.Also a lot of generally unlogical and unlikely stuff happens in the story. I thought this movie was based on a book. It makes so little sense.I think if they make a second movie and not repeat the mistakes of the first one, it could be nice. I liked the cast, the production value and generally the setting.",Enola Holmes

Cavill does a great job at Sherlock which is a hard task given recent performances from other actors in the role.
Mycroft is the usual unrelenting know it all brother dull and arrogant deeming all below him.Overall the story is nicely paced and somewhat predictable! But hey we can't give Enola the hardest of first cases can we! Hope to see more of this a series of films with Brown headlining!

There is no big discrepancy between the performance of the cast as a whole, despite the presence of an important ones, but they didn't have enough space or appropriate standards for creativity and this is due to the directing and his focus on supporting Millie Bobby Brown, but it was at the expense of the perfection of the film. and the young actress wasn't able to lead the role Sufficiently, but was only good.I think that Henry Cavill in Sherlock Holmes is the worst Sherlock Holmes ever, although his role was minor and small, but a character like Holmes should not be tampered with its importance, and this is what both the director and the actor did.
In the end, the film is considered an initial introduction of Enola Holmes' character to the world of cinema from a wide perspective and has fulfilled the job in an acceptable and entertaining manner, no more.Regarding Netflix production, I did not raise expectations in the first place.",Enola Holmes

If you enjoy Sherlock, you might not really like this all that much, however there is a possibility that you will and in that case i think you should give it a watch.
Is Enola Holmes a good movie? Sure. Is it a great movie? Definitely not, however it was VERY entertaining, and overall just good fun.

As an adult I can say that, if one disregards the unbelievable (inserted out of political correctness) elements from ""the scenery"" that make a mixture of 19th with 21st century and the political references to today's England, the action is enjoyable and funny. Even if one doesn't especially fall for the movie it is the kind one would stay until the end to see how it goes down.
Henry Cavill and Helena Bonham Carter give some good weight to the cast, but in not very obvious way, and Millie Bobby Brown plays very well the main character so in the end one has a nice film to watch as a brake from more heavier productions.

And the character of enola is a great remainder, that you should be what ever you want, and dream every second to be whatever you wish to be. Don't waste your life for the pretending to be what others want. And in that way you can enjoy much and you can actually live. And the brother's affection for a sister. Sherlock did a pretty good job admiring what enola wants to be and by supporting any means possible. Yeah, the ending could have been better and it is better if there was more excitement.

It's an adorably fun film that has classic characters in it but isn't centered around them. It's not intended to be a Sherlock Holmes tale but it gives off Sherlock vibes in Enolas character.Everyone saying it's a ""feminist"" movie, is just upset because the lead is a female that isn't a traditional young lady for the time period. But neither was Sherlock. That's why it's so fun. She's very similar to her brother and has characteristics similar to his at that age. That's the fun of it. It's just a fun movie.And what's wrong with showing a strong young woman that's just been thrown into a different world, a word of adventure. Especially in that time period. Nobody would have complained if the character would have been male or a younger Sherlock going through the same scenario. It's just showing a strong, smart, and intelligent young adult, regardless of gender, on an adventure.Watch the movie. It's family friendly and it's a fantastic adventure. Millie is adorable as always.",Enola Holmes

It does a great job of keeping you hooked and you don't realise 2 hours pass by at all!The cast of this movie was amazing and everyone did a stellar job. Special mention to protagonist, Millie Bobby Brown who absolutely smashed. Her delightful interactions with the audience by breaking the fourth wall was great to see akd after a certain point, you end up looking forward to them.This movie also saw a refreshing interpretation on the character of Sherlock. Most visual adaptations show Sherlock to be moody, brood and heartless with an air of eccentricity.
However, here they show Sherlock to be much more warm and caring. It was definitely nice to see this change of pysche.The whole movie didn't change much from the source material, although from a general point of view, the movie would be better if the plot had more suspense to it. That lacked a bit, in my opinion.Apart from that, the cinematography is great coupled with great background music!Definitely worth watching!",Enola Holmes

545,Muzxa,Not for everyone; definitely not for me,3,5 October 2020,"Let me just say this before people say anything: I do not have a problem with a strong female lead. Enola Holmes is a promising character who can do as much as her brother, but the movie is ruined by agendas.The first half of the movie is unspeakably guilty of this; every chance the protagonist gets to bash men, she does, mostly without reason.She is also not very self-aware because she calls others proud and narcissistic while being the same herself.Every character was written poorly just to make Enola seem special. They could have made her the centre of attention while ensuring that people around her have an IQ of atleast 1, but why would the writers do that when they can just insert ""haha men bad"" into every scene.I do not care about the historical accuracy of the film. I do not care about the plot holes. I do not care about the lead being a woman, but for gods sake, stop alienating a big part of the audience just to peddle an agenda, hollywood. Stop following the steps of Charlie's Angels.P.S I think people have said this enough already, but the person who cast Henry Cavill for this role was on crack.

546,teatag,Just another sermon,4,24 September 2020,"Women got the vote (in the U.S. and UK) about 100 years ago. Why is this an issue now? Couldn't the producers of this barely entertaining film have come up with a better hook on which to hang the plot? Stopping a serial killer or foiling a heist of the Bank of England, for example. The only redeeming value of this film is the presence of a semi-grownup Millie Bobby Brown who isn't bleeding from the nostrils. The actor who plays Mycroft Holmes is too small by far for the part. And the writers portray a Sherlock Holmes who lacks the perception and wit of the classic character. Enola's asides to the audience are meant to be cute -- and even funny, perhaps -- but they are neither. So, this is a film to see if your taste runs to irrelevant ""message"" movies.",Enola Holmes

Henry Cavill isn't my top choice to play Sherlock Holmes and he seemed underutilized in this movie, but what are you gonna do? Millie Bobby Brown is very likable and it is nice to see her in a different role other than playing Eleven in the hit series Stranger Things.",Enola Holmes

One day, her mother was missing and she wanted to find her. While in a way of finding her mother, Enola learning and experiencing the outside world, she also meet a company.The case is actually pretty simple once it's untied. However, the progress to untie and solve the problem that was given is appealing.
The presence of Sherlock and Mycroft are making this movie more interesting to watch.
Moreover, it's a little bit boring at almost the ending. Enola spent a little too much time to solve this and we should watched her getting here and there, while it's just doesn't really necessary.It's an eight for me.

That is exactly the opposite of the principal villain, Linthorn. He is like the Russian terminator from Stranger Things. He is intimidating and hard to spot. The Grandma trying to kill her grandkid was just way dumb. Tewksbury is a great sidekick and love interest to Enola. As Enola is smart as a tack, he is like a fox. He tricks people.

555,IMDbabe1807,Lacking in places but made up for it by Millie Bobby Brown's fantastic acting,6,24 September 2020,"This film follows Enola Holmes (Millie Bobby Brown), the astute younger sister of Sherlock (Henry Cavill) and Mycroft Holmes (Sam Claflin), on her journey to solve the mystery of her missing mother (Helena Bonham Carter) who disappears when she turns 16.Following in her mother's footsteps, Enola is tenacious and independent, and demonstrates her capability to find her own path and solve her problems and puzzles without the aid of her patronising older brothers. It was really refreshing to see such a strong-willed young female protagonist who didn't have to rely upon men to help her succeed.I have to say that Cavill as Sherlock is one of the worse castings I've ever seen. I don't think he could possibly have brought any less personality to the role if he tried. Claflin was slightly more engaging as Mycroft although still rather dull. Scenes with just the two of them were certainly not the most thrilling. I do feel the writers are also to blame here as they had the space to do something really awesome with these characters, but did not.Fortunately, Enola Holmes is so fantastic that her brothers were really not very important to her story. Brown outshone everyone else in this film beyond measure. She brought her own style of wit and charismatic charm to the role which certainly made up for areas of the film which were lacking. Enola breaking the fourth wall throughout gave even more of an opportunity for Brown to captivate the audience which she did spectacularly.This story is aimed at a slightly younger audience than previous Sherlock Holmes movies and makes for a great family film. Although at times some of the mysteries feel a bit lost, and parts of the storyline and dialogue are a little cheesy, it remains a fast-paced, entertaining and enjoyable movie.",Enola Holmes

Every male character is either evil, dumb or weak. Even Sherlock Holmes is slower than a 16 year old girl in order to elevate her importance. Heck this while movie piggybacks on the name of Sherlock Holmes and the star power of Henry Cavill. It's a big sin these days for a name protagonist to save the heroine of the story but this movie has no problem doing it the other way.

But when we got to the halfway point it was a bit messy in my opinion. Things happened in the second half that didn't really have to be in the movie and it went a bit slower. I also found the story a bit more difficult to follow. But Millie Bobby Brown, Henry Cavil and Sam Claflin played really well in this movie, but I would have liked to see more of Herny Cavil's Sherlock Holmes because there was not to much of it in the movie. The action was okay for what it was and the humor was too much at times. It was entertaining and I enjoyed watching it and I will like a sequel (which they have already set up a bit). I give this movie a 6/10 for the acting and the entertainment.",Enola Holmes

575,man14,Bad. So Bad. Too Bad.,3,24 September 2020,"I am a Sherlock Holmes fan. Always have been. So when I read that a new Sherlock Holmes related film (albeit about his less known and much younger sister Enola) was being released, I got excited. Big mistake.
Now, my problem isn't with the female character driven plot (I'm a huge fan of the Underworld or Hunger Games franchises, to name but two). Not even with the fact that Sherlock Holmes has very little screen time - I knew that from the start. No, my problem is with the fact that this film has no story - only a series of excuses to show women kicking men's asses. That's it, that's the whole film. My problem is with the fact that this film treats the audience like idiots, as if anyone in their right mind and a minimum knowledge of History would believe that the things they show in this sad excuse of a film were actually possible in the England of the late 1800's. Now, I'm all for the advancement of women's place in society and History, I'm all for it - but this is the wrong way to do it. Making films where all the men are either idiots or evil and only the women are capable and good is the wrong way to do it, not only because it's unrealistic but because it doesn't make for a good story.
There were - and are - real female heroes who, throughout History and today, fought and fight bravely for women's rights without throwing a single punch or making enemies out of men; Hollywood should tell their stories instead of making drivel like this or the more recent version of Charlie's Angels. It's a pity, really. With a decent story line and character development, it could have been a decent addition to the Holmes canon.
My advice to all who haven't seen it is: avoid it like the plague. Watch the Granada series from the 1980's with Jeremy Brett as the best Holmes ever instead. Or the more recent Sherlock or Elementary. Hell, even the two RDJ Sherlock Holmes films are preferable to this. You're very welcome.",Enola Holmes

Yet, Enola is unaffected by this and actually feels liberated on her own. Nevertheless, Enola sets out to find her mother but only because she sees it as a challenge, and not from any sense of love or loyalty. And like a modern day Millennial, Enola thinks she can get by in the world off her mother's money and a snarky attitude. For some reason, Enola happens to be the sister of Sherlock Holmes, but this factor adds nothing to the movie and is actually a distraction.",Enola Holmes

The coloring is beautiful, and the music has moments of brilliance.
The performances are adequate, nothing special. Obviously this is aimed at kids so it doesn't really matter.
Alright let's get down to the politics of it all.
Feminism existed back in the day so, get over it? Idk. Obviously it is exaggerated a little and very heavy handed. I'm a staunch feminist and it made me cringe a few times. It beats you over the head. ""You're a man when I tell you you're a man."" Seriously?
Racially, it's barely diverse. There's like, 2 bipoc actors so of course everyone's in a tizzy. First of all, bipoc people also existed back then, and to barr them from roles that they wouldn't have played at that time is, well, racist. Do you get it?
Anyway, it's fine. A fun kid flick, but even I, a young adult woman, was bored at times. The movie was far too long and the romance subplot was entirely useless. Honestly, I wouldn't watch again, but if you need something to turn on for the kids and not really pay attention to, it's fine.",Enola Holmes

Even though the little love story was sewed into the main plot, but I often found it taking huge chunks of the movie runtime. Their love story was arguably distracting and unnecessary for the movies main plot.Enola Holmes also falls short with their character development for character such as Sherlock Holmes and his brother. Even though the movie makes it clear that they have been maintaining a distance from their mother and sister, the story doesn't care to explain their reasons. I felt this might've have been a necessary plot to give the viewers a more understandable Enola HolmesHowever, if these two flaws doesn't not bother you as a viewer, this is very well an enjoyable and pleasant film.",Enola Holmes

594,AParkinson-2,So much to like but gets lost in its own ideas.,5,19 October 2020,"I think this movie had an idea but got lost somewhere along the way. Enola is almost a Mary Sue, but with just enough flaws and failures to not be. What starts with a great intrigue about her mother and puzzles disappears and never really revisits. No real complex solve, just a very obvious 'who stands to gain the most' crime. The role of Sherlock and his Sister was what I felt worked best. I just never really felt anything for any of these people. Something was missing, maybe it was the sparodic 'down with the patriarchy' message which were jettisoned in for reasons. A smarter writer would simply display her character as a rebuttal to the society, you didn't need absurd caricatures to push an unbelievable representation of the 1800/1900s.

Pros:
In my opinion, the production design was the best part of the movie and the 18th century London look was great. Everything looks good.The A-list castSome of the action sequences were well shotCons:
The plot is all over the place. It starts as a mystery to find the mother, then rebelling against the stereotypical jerk brother, than romance with some boy and a dude trying to kill them.Annoying feminism messages thrown in your face the entire movieEnola doesn't have a clear motivation, thanks to the muddled plotThe ending is not climactic and the missing mother subplot is resolved in the most boring wayThe film overstays it's welcome, runtime is too long",Enola Holmes

The casting for the characters of Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes is a train wreck, both in terms of their physical traits and their personalities.

600,NikiSarah,This is Enola not Sherlock!,9,25 September 2020,"Most of the bad reviews seem to be people complaining that she's not Sherlock. Seriously?! The girl is 16 and just beginning to see the world and put her deductive skills to use. And Sherlock was not born with a magnifying glass in his hand either! But apparently since no one has done an ""origin"" story of Sherlock people can't comprehend that he had to start somewhere too, and so is Enola now.
And no, the movie is not too ""woke"". British women gained the right to vote in 1918, and this takes place in 1900 so it's not too far off for them to have started the suffrage movement.
The movie was beautiful, fun and had a good message. Not really a fan of breaking the 4th wall but Millie Bobby Brown is adorable so I'll give it a pass. The Tewksbury case wasn't very complicated but, again, following the clues to her mother makes up for it.

For a spinoff of SHERLOCK Holmes, it feels nothing like Sherlock Holmes. For one thing it violates Sherlock Holmes' sacred rule: there is no Sherlock Holmes without Watson. Watson is never seen or mentioned, and Mycroft ironically looks like Watson. Sherlock is barely in it, and does pretty much nothing except care a little for his sister.The film also tries to set up a past conflict within the Holmes family, but it gets no resolution. An effect of this is a very black and white portrayal of Mycroft being an evil misogynist and Sherlock and Enola being saints. And both their apathy or hatred for their mother is never really explained.I feel like the film could have had potential if it separated itself from Sherlock Holmes and filled the gaps with its own story. Bogging it down even further is its themes about women's empowerment, that fails because it tries to piggyback off of a famous piece of media instead of doing the work of creating an original and engaging story",Enola Holmes

Personally I can appreciate how the writer and director adopt this philosophy. I think they managed to keep me engaged throughout every scene of the movie. The movie is truly an enjoyable work of art if you let go and allow your mind to take these side stories /scenes in as well as you can, you will see a movie that depicts a unbound unchained girl live out an exciting and over the top series of events.Now finished the movie left me in a uplifted state of mind and i must say I pretty much needed that today. Needing to rate the movie I want to give it a 7.5 but needing to round it, it becomes an 8. why not round it down you ask? Even if it doesn't have a plot and storyline deserving of the great 8 it compensates a lot with sheer entertainment value.I will wach this movie again someday in the future & hope the writers and directors make make more of these moves.

626,kecward78-935-120834,Fun little film about ENOLA,8,17 October 2020,"I see many posters complaining, comparing this to a Sherlock book/movie. I don't understand why the comparison. This is more a coming-of-age film about a young woman that rebels against the male-dominant culture and does things *her way*. While her focus was primarily on finding her mother, Out in the real world, she finds things not as simple as her previous cocooned life. She doesn't subscribe to the damsel-in-distress needing help from men, and on the contrary, is in the dominant role of protector on several occasions. Her older brother, Mycroft, is a typical male in the sense of *men dominant, women subservient* role. He is the most one-note character of the film. Younger brother, Sherlock, is more nuanced and balanced, often seen as a role model for the burgeoning investigative talents of his younger sister. This is an excellent role for Millie Bobby Brown, expanding her talents to become a lead in a movie. I loved her breaking the fourth wall and being the primary was an amazing supporting cast. I love her transitioning from child actor to adult/young adult actor, with her character in this movie doing the same.",Enola Holmes
627,sj7075-292-151006,"Boring, tame and an hour too long",3,5 October 2020,"Ok, so this is a new take on Sherlock Holmes. Enola Holmes is the brat little sister of the great Sherlock Holmes (Henry Cavill) and the eldest brother Mycroft Holmes.Murder, mystery, you know the story, right?Well, this time around the mystery isn't anything as exciting. There are a few mysteries in one in this story, two of them present themselves in the opening 15 minutes of the movie, the last comes much later along.The problem is, the mysteries are pretty tame by Sherlock standards. Finding out the mysteries with the film, feels incredibly stretched, as too many times through this movie, we see flashbacks that just add nothing to the story or mystery in clues. You don't try and predict the mystery as the story progresses, you just sit quietly expecting a grand reveal at the end, but it never comes. There are plenty of feminist, woke parts to this movie. An all womens self defence class run by a black woman, above a tea shop? Should have been left on the cuttin room floor, as that only served as a minor clue source that took up too much time.Between 4 of us adults watching this film, we struggled to maintain focus on the film, the mystery to it all, fairly predictable. So there is no grand reveal, and neither is there a point to the main mystery, as apparently it wasn't a bread crumb trail left to follow (despite it clearly being so) as there was nothing missing, it was just past off as a normal the ""twist"" to the end.The other storylines being sewn up are VERY predictable, but relate to characters that aren't even apart of the film as characters, so its like ""oh the maid did it"" even though she had one scene in the entire film where she didn't even speak. So weak!Enola is funny at times, but mostly pretty annoying. She breaks the 4th wall, talking to the audience at times, but it comes across as trying to be too clever, where you're left thinking ""why can't some of that humour and sense of reality be put into the actual script and dialogue of the characters?"" She's both a super strong fighter, and a coward running away from trouble she could have previously handled. Sherlock has barely a part in this movie, Henry Cavill making zero impact in this, so if you're a fan, you'll be yearning for more. The main Bad Guy? Well, he's sadly no mystery either as apparent early on through the movie. The movie tends to take a dump regularly on men, with female characters constantly referring to men as useless. Part of the story seems to almost justify murder to push an agenda of womens rights. It didn't feel right towards the end of the movie the message being put out, seems to be its ok to hate on men, and hurt people to push your agenda when its feminism leading the kill.And my god, this movie is boring! Was easily an hour too long at 2 hours, where this could have easily been a Christmas 1 hour special wrapped up very neatly, if it had brung in the characters played by stars to make it shine more. They had nothing to add to this movie.",Enola Holmes

Enola's complex relationship with her distant, famous brother Sherlock Holmes adds an interesting dynamic to the movie.I'll be eagerly awaiting the sequel. This is well worth a watch.",Enola Holmes

bottom line - I did not even finish the movie.
The whole movie is just not interesting enough, packed with tons of cliche and shalow dialogs.
Henry Cavill is not a good sherlock by the way.
If you are an adult, i would not recommend watching this movie.",Enola Holmes

I loved Enola's asides most of all. The film is a beautiful compliment and nod to multiple Sherlock series but with it's own unique take from a feminine perspective that presents as both traditional and sardonic at the same time. Only wish was that Sherlock was a bit more involved.",Enola Holmes

Millie did such an amazing job with the role. She was funny and sincere. Her acting gets better and better with each role. And she produced along with her sister. Such a great job.I liked the story and had great pacing. It was not boring or dragged at all at any time during the movie.I guess my one complaint is Henry Cavill. He always gives very wooded performances. And Enola Holmes was not the exception. But he did fine enough job. Not bad.I highly recommend and hope Netflix makes a sequel.,Enola Holmes

641,AndrewRMButcher,"Meaningless, Pointless, Insulting",3,6 October 2020,"This film could have been a great adventure, but the biggest letdown of this film was the sexism. I understand women feel misrepresented in films and want more of the spotlight, and we should as film makers create more diversity, with more diverse cast etc. And women feel insulted by films and TV when they are not the focus. But that doesn't mean you can completely flip it onto men. If it's about equality, why are we accepting women characters referring to the male characters as 'useless' and other derogatory terms. Not all men are 'useless boys'. This is demeaning for a bloke and I'm fed up with seeing it in every film made for feminist reasons. Stereotypes of women aren't allowed, so why are stereotypes of men? With Mycroft being a horrible person and so controlling? To please a certain crowd by showing the viewer that the world apparently doesn't need men, as Enola doesn't need a father or her brothers, the men are not needed. I wonder if I made a Sherlock Holmes film with that in it against women. Without that, this film would have just made it, with an exceptional cast to fill the roles. The sense of adventure was great, the only other things that made this film lack were the unnecessary fourth wall breaking and the structure of the film. We seem to completely switch narratives at one point, which is very random and it does jar out quite big. Fourth wall breaking is risky, as it is done so seamlessly in Deadpool without fault, it can be hard to replicate, and it has to fit the story and the character. But for this film, it didn't work. It didn't suit her character and all these bits felt pointless and cringe worthy, not funny or smart or clever. It wouldn't have even worked with Sherlock, because that's not his character type. I find with adaptations, it only works if the source material is the same. So apart from the constant insults to men, meaningless fourth wall breaking and complete change in narrative, the film was alright. Henry Cavill was a great Sherlock.",Enola Holmes
642,alicekprof,"You all say ""feminism"" like it's something bad.",8,2 October 2020,"Seriously chill. It's just a nice family movie. And actually the brave and extraodinary for that time, female characters did existed in many many book novels, not just this one. If you dont know that, then you are embaracing yourself. If I had a daughter, or a son, I d wanted them to watch this. The negative reviews, are really not from functional adults, and can be ignored.",Enola Holmes
643,SaberaSurovy,I loved it.,8,24 September 2020,"Millie Bobby Brown was amazing. Her cheerful acting as a free, curious, and witty teenager was marvelous. And specifically breaking the fourth wall scenes are the ones that I enjoyed most.
Helena Bonham Carter as in the role of mother was very inspiring. Truly mothers like Eudoria Holmes are the kind of role models every daughter needs in every generation.
Now to talk about the elephant in the room, the Holmes brothers, none of them met any expectations.Henry Cavill in the role of Sherlock acted like the typical charming wise-mind detective he is where in this specific movie the more brotherly side of his was needed to be shown. And Mycroft was a total disaster.Sam Clafin did not suit the role at all. Mycroft is supposed to be calmer, more rational, and wiser than Sherlock. But in this movie, he was shown as a hot-headed, cynical man. Neither the book nor the series character was reflected upon the movie role which was a big disappointment for me.The story was good so far. It showed feminism in its own way. Except for the Holmes brothers' shortcomings, this movie is a good piece.",Enola Holmes
644,medwards1,"A very good film, held together with a scintillating lead performance from a young actress",8,1 October 2020,"I have not read any other reviews on here, but seeing the overall rating I can imagine there will be a lot of whinging.I would imagine the moaning comes primarily for two reasons:Firstly, I imagine big fans of the books will be mad that it doesn't fit exactly their perception of those books, and especially I guess, that Sherlock displays feelings and such.For me, I have never been a big fan of the books, and only really know the characters because of their endless repeated representation in film and TV.If you want portrayals of Sherlock more accurate to the books I suggest watching the old Basil Rahbone films. But if this is your primary concern, then you have somewhat missed the entire point of the film. As the title should suggest to you, this is a film about his sister, Enola. I am sure this is another bone of contention with the diehards. I have no idea if Enola was a character in the books or not, personally never heard of her before, so I imagine perhaps not, but to be honest, it doesn't really matter. By this stage there have been so very many versions of Sherlock Holmes presented to us on screen, I am sure that every single aspect of the characterisation of him from the novels has been bent if not broken before.Secondly, I imagine there are a lot of people moaning at the very idea a film should have a positive and affirmative role for a young woman. I am sure there are middle aged men with skin the hue of finely glazed gammon frothing at the mouth at the perceived 'wokeness' of this film (and probably badly disguising this angst with negative comments about acting etc).My view is that everyone needs role models, and if you don't know that this was a time period with particularly feisty and proactive feminist icons striving to make their way in varied 'male dominated' positions in society, then shame on you. This is a film that presents such a character. Educated and emboldened by a mother who said 'to hell with what society expects of us' this is a young woman who is on a quest to find herself, more than her mother, and although at the beginning she does not know what she wants, she very much knows what she does not want.I personally found Mille Bobby Brown utterly brilliant in this film. Perfect comedy timing, really good acting and a sense of purpose behind her role, borne no doubt out of her executive producer role in its production. She held our attention throughout, and created an interesting and inspiring character. Also, I must say, despite the push against the convention of how Sherlock is usually played, I really loved Henry Cavill in his role, and his scenes with Mille were some of the very best in the film.The films action was well paced and entertaining, and I ended feeling happy and smiling, like an old favourite Disney film.All in all I felt, for someone like my niece, or my younger female cousins, this film would be one of the best things ever made. For me, a man in his forties, I would give it a very solid 8 out of 10, and I hope we get to see more of this exciting character in future film projects.",Enola Holmes

Because the film takes place in the Sherlock Holmes universe, I imagine that most people thought it would have a great mystery, but a lot in the film is discovered just by inverting a name.

It could have been so entertaining, but...I guess I am just an old softie, but I thought it was way too violent. The scenes in the warehouse between Enola and the predator, and then in the mansion between Enola, Tewkesbury and the predator, in my opinion, were gratuitously violent. They could have exhibited menace and maleficence without being so graphic, and their intensity was stark in comparison to the lighthearted nature of the remainder of the movie. People have referred to it as being family-friendly--- maybe for 11 or 12 year old or older, but younger than that would bring about a lot of nightmares.I would also like to have seen more of Enola and Tewkesbury on screen; their relationship was sweet, and should have been developed more.Missed the mark for me.

Don't come back as it's a 're-imagining' and is 'updating' - no, the time period setting should be true to the story. Did they have modern cars? Why not?
Those suggesting about Harry Potter.....what if Potter was re-imagined as a black farm boy with no magic powers and no Hogwarts? Would it be considered inaccurate?
Holmes, much like Bond, is a set world, set characters who act specific ways.
By all means create a female centric version, but don't use the Holmes name.
Interesting that the original writers estate is currently suing this film for misrepresenting it's core characters. Elona Holmes was written in 2008 by a writer piggy-backing off a known brand. Really lazy. Sums up this generation.",Enola Holmes

It was like getting an extra level into the film and the characters, and allowed me to associate more. This is good, as without the 4th wall breaks the film is relatively basic. Some clever word play, lovely victorian-esque set pieces and a great cast keep this movie going along rather well.The people putting this film down need to check themselves; it's based on a novel and is fictional. It's only similar to the past. People need to stop glorifying the 1800's as some sort of golden age, calling for realism. Why would you want to watch a film where you're segregated because of race and women are barely treated as humans and are essentially ignored in legislation.

Equal rights has always been a tough fight and we get to see a glimpse of how the women at that time were battling it and the sacrifices they had to make.

I loved her in Stranger Things but found her performance a bit underwhelming in Godzilla (although it was in a secondary role). She looked totally into making this movie work, and it worked so well. It had you constantly on the edge of you seat, not knowing what shenanigans would come next.

As for historical accuracy. The character Enola's representation is the most inaccurate: lose hair, low necklines during day time, no hat etc. But the character in the background of shots were immaculately dressed. As if the costume designers put more work into them than the main characters.
Furthermore, a lot of people have criticized it for being too ""pc"" for its inclusiveness.

The continual breaking of the Fourth Wall by the lead character is annoying. Since we all know that the film has no relationship with real life, past or present, it is irritating to have someone tapping on the lens shouting, ""This isn't real, you know!"" The audience worked that out very quickly.
While the leads, Enola and Tewksbury have some screen credibility, the remainder are very one dimensional. Mycroft is a scowling dolt, Sherlock is no brighter but has a nice smile, mother is barking mad, most of Tewksbury's family should be locked into the same asylum. We are also given the token black woman who adds nothing to the story other than tick another box on the director's list.

Millie does an alright job filling in those shoes, I just feel like the writing sometimes is a bit lackluster because it tries to be so many things at once. For example I found myself wanting more badassery from a 16 year old that have been trained in martial arts for so long but the comedy came in the way of that.(and the clichéd one move that she couldn't figure out until the end was so unnecessary.) Also I found myself wanting more depth in any of the relationships she had, i.e. with Sherlock, Mycroft or the Vicount, but the detective story came in the way of that. For a runtime of 123 minutes I felt little was accomplished or earned and everything just kind of fell into place out of nowhere in the end.",Enola Holmes

690,christopher-a-carlson,"Not for a Sherlock fan, or TV watcher",3,18 November 2020,"Really tried hard to wedge a place for Millie Brown into the Sherlock series. She was good as 7 but now she's a bit over hyped and she seems to buy her own hype. She's a good actor who has yet to really do work, me thinks. Other actors try their best to prop her up but clearly it is a lot to ask. I find her more than a little ostentatious and perhaps one too many adderal doses before shooting: I live Sherlock, all the way back to the original, this is a departure I think I can safely say. Still better than many shows I guess. The gradual cutification and dumbing down of stories with unwanted action or romance continues",Enola Holmes
691,amamka,Agenda is not the worst part of this... piece,1,30 September 2020,"The worst is that this is now a thing in the world that someone can use your favorite characters to popularize ones mediocre writing. Also what is bad is script and actors play.
So empty, so luscious.
Specially i hate play of this Natalie Portman clone which trying so hard to display that she is definitely not a character but a very, even overly talented teen actor which is so pro in grimacing. She is overplayed like every second of it. Jim Carrie - not less.
This movie in some strange way insults me as a watcher. I mean, why creators of this thinks so bad of watchers that they allowed this exist? Cant recall that i hated any other movie this much. Let me think... oh i hated ""the shape of water"" almost like this one. But this is much worse actually. It is worse than any avengers movie. It is worse than ""banker"" worse than any jaden smith movie, worse than hunger games, divergent and twilight. I would probably even rather watch whole Garry Potter which i hate than watch 15 minutes of this. It is definitely worst film i ever watched. Like seriously",Enola Holmes

I was pretty entertained by the whole thing. It was quite fun, didn't take itself too seriously while still having some deeper themes. It was a good journey through Enola finding out who she is and navigating the world of the time as a woman. While having themes that translate into our current society.",Enola Holmes

It had a wonderful, mysterious, very eventful storyline which fell well within line of the Sherlock Holmes films we've come the love over the years. It's completely unique and I love the ""Family friendly"" vibe. We NEED more of this right now!! In Fact, I personally would LOVE to see this become an ""Original Series""!!

So what if the mother is a feminist...they did exist back then!
Also, I have been a huge fan of Sherlock Holmes for many decades, but I was not offended by this movie at all, in fact I haven't had so much fun watching a movie in ages!
The story was fresh, the characters great with a wonderful line up of actors. The visuals and the soundtrack were a feast for the senses.
This was an enjoyable movie that I highly recommend!

She being such a strong, smart, and independent girl, she cries at the very slightest yell by Mycroft. Like she really just crumbles and cries. I never would want to see a strong female role succumb so easily and so often. I wanted to like this so much.

(nahhhh),4,24 September 2020,"When you put in the title the name Holmes, you excpect mystery, a very good dedective that observes every little detail, and makes fast accurate conclusions. In this movie this happend 2-3 times by Enola Holmes, and actually without investigating impressive clues at all.I really was looking forward to this movie because the idea of a woman dedective, fascinated me.(The femisists ideas by the way, in this kind of movies are kind of boring, even more when the movie focuses too much in these )
Where are the 500 IQ conclusions, the moments that explain everything to the viewer , things that Holmes did in secret and we had no idea, things that he observed and we didn't even noticed. Where are the ""OWWWWW that's brilliant"" in this movie. I didn't feel that way even one time.
Don't say that the movie didn't want this kind of plot. They use the name holmes in the title, they talk about a young lady that is well educated, smart and Holmes' sister. You go to watch this movie for a young dedective and you don't find one.",Enola Holmes

Brown has a nice, easygoing way with the material, cheekily outpacing her famous brother Sherlock here and there and often doing fourth-wall breaks to smirk at the audience, and I loved Miss Harrison's steampunky motor car.

Millie Bobbie Brown is delightful as the title role, a witty and energetic young actress with the victorian beauty of Kiera Knightly. Where I was put off by this movie was the annoyingly in-your-face feminism. As a woman myself, I'm all for women's equality and all that, but a film needs a certain subtly to it's message so as not to be distracting. I wanted to give specific examples, but quite frankly the movie is so interwoven with them I couldn't even pick any out.

The main character was fairly engaging and there was a clear overarching plot. Is it similar to Sherlock Holmes? No, not really. I also wouldn't recommend this if you're going to think about the plot logically. Why Enola out of all people has to be the one to find her mother is beyond me.

717,danuk-4,Agenda driven nonsense,3,28 September 2020,"This movie looks pretty and begins well but very quickly becomes mired in confusion and agenda driven identity nonsense. The 4th wall gets broken on multiple occasions which feels highly out of place within the context of the narrative. The idea that this is the sister of the already famous character Sherlock Holmes is neither here nor there. The actual Sherlock Holmes is portrayed as a heartless nobody. Somebody could have perhaps created a new storybook character rather than high jack an existing one - badly. This writers of this film appear too hung up on other issues rather than just telling a good story. You will be disappointed in this film if you enjoy decent, meaningful and moving cinema. This is hollow and silly and could have been far better if only the people involved weren't so obsessed with this poisonous identity politics.",Enola Holmes

720,ninja-111,Underwelming and stumbling.,6,23 September 2020,"The most surprising part about this flick, is that it appears to have been directed by a rookie; poorly and with a glance at Guy Ritchie, and filmed by a moderately talented high schooler who learned cinematography from YouTube. The lighting is dreadful and so flat at times it risks falling of the screen from a stiff breeze.Acting, writing, and so on was adequate, but the plot couldve been so, so much darker if they just dared to go there - theres a hitman out to murder children for Pete's sake. Doesnt get much darker than that. And it is the times of the Women Reform - remember, this is London in the early 1900s. Women were basically second class citizens, barely more worth than the orphans and tarts of Whitechapel if not in the company of a man.
Keep heaping on the darkness, and we'd have something worthy of watching.On a personal note: Sherlock and Mycroft are the characters in name only. They share close to nothing with the originals.
Example; Sherlock cares about others, and Mycroft is thin and short tempered.In short: it stumbles between mildy interesting characters, moderately intriguing plot and a coming of age story, only to end with a wimpering yawn.
Hopefully this will become a series akin to the BBC Sherlock, and this travesty is only a show finding its footing.",Enola Holmes

Its a actually very refreshing seeing it from a different standpoint.The big peoblem though.... This whole story builds up to her finding her mother. After a certain event she is good with Sherlock, with which she's always been. But suddenly there seems to be a time frame twist and switch my we see her with her mother some small talk and thats it!

This is a wonderful movie that showcases that women and girls are strong, powerful, intelligent, empathetic, witty and unique! I wish I had seen a movie like this when I was a young girl growing up.

BTW, in regards to all the bad reviews........ they mostly are from very thin skinned people which somehow took an issue with the movie theme, ooff..... sad world
I'm not a teenage girl (not even a girl for that matter) and I consider myself a rather big Sherlock Holmes fan, safe from Mycroft (which deviates quite a bit from the original character) everything else is absolutely tolerable as per Holmes ""universe"" integration and historical representation.

745,sharnelperera,Snooze fest,3,26 September 2020,"I was so excited to watch this, being a big fan of the older Sherlock Holmes films, but this was honestly nothing more than a snooze fest. The cast was impressive however the storyline was incredibly boring. You'd think a film revolving around the mystery disappearance of Sherlock Holmes (and therefore Enola Holmes's) mother would be somewhat exciting.... but it isn't. Probably the most infuriating thing about the film is Enola herself where she insists on speaking directly to us, the audience. Yes, we get it, you're a young and curious girl about to go on an 'adventure'. Just shut up and get on with it will you?! Sadly, the 'adventure' just never eventuates until maybe the last 10 minutes or so where there is a brief and extremely boring moment where Enola and her love interest are being shot at. But neither is seriously injured ofcourse. Throughout the film, the so called 'puzzle' regarding Enola's mother's disappearance unravels excruciating slowly and with seemingly very little effort or any real detective work. About a quarter of the way into this film, I was looking at the clock wondering when it will end and debating whether or not I should just switch it off early. I persevered on the silly notion that perhaps it will get better. Unfortunately, it didn't.",Enola Holmes

Good moral story, wrongly and badly presented.",6,2 October 2020,"Enola Holmes is a decent movie overall but it has been presented rather unrealistic and false. The way the movie has been presented, feels like it's just for the sake of diversity. The whole plot is biased, false and unpleasant, their intention is for sure good but the presentation may lead sensitive viewers towards the wrong and false. If you are to watch this movie, I would strongly recommend the viewer to not get influenced and understand the jist which is that not everyone is going to help you achieve your goal, you'll have to carve your way out. Wisdom has always been the key to survive, it still is, it will always be. Discipline brings order into life, it is never wrong to be disciplined, the definition and the demonstration of discipline has been presented very wrongly, discipline can never be bad for an individual and one should know what it really is.

I fell in love with the movie the minute I saw the girl and realized what an engaging character she was and how very appropriate this is for the time we live in. With all the political things going on and the oppression of women that are still continuing to this day, the main character has really captured my heart. Honestly anyone that did not read this well did not really watch the movie or did not care for the character. They probably were someone that did not really care for women and women's rights. It was so well done and so well acted with a great cast and a great story line. Of course, you cannot argue with Sherlock Holmes being part of it. It didn't have to be watched by a 15-year-old by the way as one of the reviewers stated. if anything it is something that I, as a 60 year old loved, as did my 62 year old husband.",Enola Holmes
754,maysaif,"Feel good, family friendly movie",9,23 September 2020,"First of all, people need to realize that this is NOT a Sherlock Holmes story, so stop comparing it to Sherlock & rating it that way.I'm a stickler when it comes to Sherlock too and I was worried that I wasn't going to like the character be played a bit differently from what I've seen in the trailer. But to my delight, even though Henry did not play the classic version of Sherlock, he still gave a wonderful performance with a softer version of the character that made Sherlock even more appealing which fit really well within this story.Second of all, this film is an absolute delight. I'm not usually a fan of breaking the 4th wall, but it worked well in this movie.Millie's performance was brilliant, the character fits her perfectly. She's a natural & is always a joy to watch.Now I understand that not everyone is a fan of feminism, I'm not particularly a feminist myself, but it still wasn't an overwhelming theme in this movie for me. It was done just right. So stop complaining about that. The movie is called ENOLA Holmes, what did you expect?If you don't particularly like the mystery storyline in this movie, then surely the music (which took me back to wonderful 1990s family movies), the acting, the costumes, the whole atmosphere and vibe of Victorian era England will make this movie worth watching.",Enola Holmes
755,chelseaertel,Fun Victorian Romp,10,27 September 2020,"I loved it, much needed distraction from real life. Ms. Brown did a marvelous job, charming and lovely playing a strong intelligent young woman. If you are looking for just good old entertainment, this works great.",Enola Holmes

I really loved that it's not only women centric, but even has that realistic feel to it. As a16 year old girl Millie has a fantastic job and delivered fine. She is way ahead of her age in acting.",Enola Holmes

I mean, you cannot fault Henry Cavill!!!The whole story line I just didn't really get, just seemed all over the place and at some parts I just got lost. Wasn't too sure on the ending either. It was a beautiful film though.",Enola Holmes

The film did fairly good in all aspects, comedy, mystery and emotion. Milly bobby brown's acting was fantastic. She did a very good job, perfect for the character and I enjoyed it very much. The humor was played very differently and was very fun to watch.
It might have not met many people's expectations , but I would suggest you all to watch without any and you will have a wonderful , fun filled journey.",Enola Holmes

761,Mingui-wise,Good but that's as far as it goes,6,30 September 2020,"The film narrates an entertaining adventure in the universe of Sherlock Holmes, this time as his sister Enola as protagonist, so far so good, the problem is the basic mental games that are only based on ignorance of the viewer, There is a clear discofiguration of the time, and without big scenes to show us, another sensationalist film with an air of progressivism that does not manage to transmit close enough to be considered a good film.",Enola Holmes
762,bijoubrown,It's Not That Bad,7,24 September 2020,"There's a lot of plot, not too many characters, but a lot of winding plot. Enola herself was cute and fun, and served some punches that were sometimes unexpected. The backstory of her and her mom was interesting, although we don't see much of that relationship in the movie, which rendered it lost in the scuffle. With how heavy-handed cryptology was in the beginning, it became an echoing theme nearing the end. I thought the relationship (romantic?) between Enola and the Lord Viscount was more of a McGuffin, and as with many movie romances, seemed somewhat of an unnecessary peripheral plot point. Going into the movie, I thought I might be annoyed-based on the embellished trailer. But the movie was like a better, more evolved version of the trailer. This movie depicts a dark time in America's history for women's rights in a family-friendly way, similar to A Little Princess, except in 1884. In the end, this movie seemed like a set-up for a sequel.",Enola Holmes
763,vadimdovbysh,Just awful,1,30 December 2020,"Nothing close to mystery of excitement that Robert Downy Jr. Or Benedict Cumberbach brought with their Sherlock films. It was terrible.

Including my worst enemy.",Enola Holmes

The mystery of Enola's mother's disappearance is the main focus of the story. In the process Enola meets a friend who has also been missing. She goes on her own adventure and discovers who she will become. Millie Bobby Brown is excellent as Enola and Henry Cavill and Helena Bonham Carter as usual deliver great performances.",Enola Holmes
765,vtemple-46747,Excellent Barrier Breaker,10,6 December 2020,Ok. I'm a huge fan of Sherlock Holmes. Bit skeptical going in on this one. But had a few of my absolute favourite actors.

766,Curiouscat13,This film is for younger audiences,3,25 May 2021,"I think only younger folks will tolerate so much preaching about how to be 'a strong' female blah blah blah. As I am already a strong grown up female I find this film boring. This film is very moralistic. The male characters are like cartoons and I am bored of seeing Helena Bonham Carter in yet another corseted dress...I find nothing refreshing about this movie, just pushing feminism agenda, no real story to tell.",Enola Holmes
767,sravansunkara,Awesome movie,10,2 May 2021,"Really it's a wonderful experience watching this movie. We don't get bored throughout the movie. It has best production values, costumes and strong acting from Millie, Henry and Louis. I think it was well written keeping the suspence until the last, maybe there are best movies than this but i can assure that the experience this movie gives is like something we can't explain. Worth watching it.Love you Millie :)",Enola Holmes
768,guacamoledeath,"Feminism, fine; domestic terrorism, nah",6,27 September 2020,"A truly wonderful cast brings to life a fun adventure peppered with humor...and feminism. Not subtle nods to feminism, but repeated jabs to the face: ""here it is!"" ""Here's some more!"" And I didn't mind.After all, the world ought to be equally accessible for everyone. A fight for feminism is a fight for all. I thought it worked well with a female lead; a girl coming of age who wields her intelligence to thumb her nose at the world's chauvinist conventions.I just don't like feeling ""preached"" at. And yet, I enjoyed the light-hearted telling enough that I shrugged off the angry, 'woke' messaging that brimmed underneath every scene, like a crowd of marching ""nasty women"" in pink hats screaming at the audience through the film.SPOILER
It was only at the end, when the brilliant, enlightened Holmes mother, using all her powers of deduction and logic, concluded that the most reasonable course of action was domestic terrorism - a bombing. Because in a world progressing too slowly for women's rights, blowing up the House of Lords - while they were convened for a vote - would of course bring about the desired change. ""Give us what we want or we'll kill you.""That was the great message from the genius Holmes matriarch. Thank goodness her pure daughter managed the same effect with zero loss of life (well there was that one guy, but he was a killer).Anyway, other than that repulsive subplot thread, I found the movie enjoyable and entertaining.",Enola Holmes
769,the_malbogia,"Its decent (7.8), had a lot of wasted potential",8,26 September 2020,"This 100% feels like a movie that was made with tweens in mind. As a result, a lot of what happens in terms of plot points, themes, story, and actions that happen are either ridiculous, impossible, or spoonfed to you.This isnt to imply this movie is bad, just to say, its not made to be some award winning piece of fiction that changes the landscape of women in films. Its an enjoyable fictional tale of the sister of sherlock holmes. This fictional tale basically considered ""What is Sherlock has a tween sister that was just as clever and interesting as her, but had to deal also with being a woman during the time where woman were meant to be seen and not heard"". Its basically a Nancy Drew story set in the Sherlock mythos.The story is overall fun and enjoyable. The cast they picked did the show justice, the story is somewhat moving, and somewhat interesting, and the character of Elona Holmes in an interesting one. Its a nice 2 hrs watch, with this over looming mystery of 'The Mother of Sherlock Holmes"".There are a couple of problems I have with the film. While I didnt expect it to be beyound exceptional, there were bits that really annoyed me. The 4th wall breaking is supposed to add something to the story. Maybe give the audience a look into the head of Elona, or maybe point out something that Elona noticed that we would overlook. What they use the 4th Wall Breaks for mainly is to spoonfeed the audience the thoughts, feelings, and story. As though the audience wasnt intelligent enough to understand whats going on, they had 4th wall breaks to constantly catch you up. And the story of the mother is built up heavily for roughly half the movie, only to somewhat abandon the reason they were building the story of the mother up. What they should have done was to build the mother's story a mystery the audience could look forward to in a future film. While this is still a possibility, there isnt any real desire or cliff hanger feeling to the mothers story.Overall, its an enjoyable piece of fiction. But potential of an ongoing mystery series seems to already have been abandon. No lead into possible other films or possible other stories is even hinted at. The film plays out like a ""I'm Elona Holmes, this is my story, and thats it. Thank you for listening"".",Enola Holmes
770,will9342,Nice surprise fun movie,7,5 October 2020,"I really started watching this movie to see how Millie Bobby Brown handles herself after Stranger things. I really believe this young lady has a very promising career ahead of her. She made the film fun to watch. Another actor I enjoy watching, Henry Cavils, has a fairly small role here, pity.

771,GovertOps,Extra point for choice of brothers,8,23 September 2020,"As far as I've read, no one mentions the fact that Henry Cavill en Sam Claflin actually look alike. I have never seen actors being cast as brothers that really look like they could have been brothers. A truly amazing and very rare feat. I suggest we promote the creation of an Oscar for casting, just for this year, then forget all about it because we know this will probably never happen again.Oh yeah, there's also a story, screenplay, acting and whatever.

For me, her first appearance and talking directly to the audience, had me won over. She is excellent and her performance carries the film. It may not be a ""real"" Sherlock Holmes style mystery and, yes, she is very modern but that is part of the charm of both the movie and her performance.I'd love to see a sequel. Which is a ringing endorsement from me!",Enola Holmes
776,baker_boy86,I wanted to like this film,5,3 October 2020,"I mean this is not awful but it does seem to do an injustice to the Holmes titles. Perhaps its because I enjoyed the novel or the Cumberbatch version that I am holding this in the same light but it feels like a mixture of an episode of the BBC version and a quirky teen drama. Perhaps this is to entice a younger audience into the name but as a mid thirty dude all this did for me was raise my eyebrow every so often.
It is a good in the background film and has a few pleasant spots. The cast was good for this. Overall I didn't find the mental satisfaction that I have from other Holmes titled books/tv/films",Enola Holmes

Just the movie itself.You don't have to be a Holmes to figure out the whole plot of the movie. It's filled with clichés, you can see everything that's coming, from the jokes (it tries to be a funny movie but fails) to the villain.The way it's filmed it tries to emulate the other Holmes films, but for teenage audience. It's well done except for the fourth wall breaking. It's not used in the correct way, is annoying and the constant looking of Enola directly to the camera without saying anything gives the movie an essence of a lame actress (which is not the case with Millie Bobby Brown) that forgets that she is filming and looks where she shouldn't. The same goes with all the feminist messages in the movie. Most of them are forced. You don't have to say all the time that the female character is clever and strong, as good as her brother Sherlock, just show it, make the audience believe that with her actions, not with words coming all the time from other characters mouths. That's how you deliver a powerful messages especially to the young audience, well executed actions mean more than repetitive phrases.Most of the characters are well done (some are clichés but work). Millie Bobby Brown performance is solid (despite the fourth wall issue), Helena Bonham Carter is great, just another walk in the park for her tho, it's not a complicated character (which I wish appeared more in the movie) and Henry Cavill is ok, not the usual Sherlock but at times the classic character comes out and shines.Nevertheless is an enjoyable movie, a new perspective that needs to be polished. Not the detective movie to rack your brains out, but the one to turn them off and relax.",Enola Holmes

Thought it was really well done, not like the book entirely, but a good story. Acting was great.

But they tried so hard they forgot to tell us why her mother was gone and they forgot to make Enola find her instead they threw too many feminist thing like ""don't be thrown off course by other people ESPECIALLY MEN!""

I think this movie makes everyone other than the heroine too stupid, just to make her stand out.Up until Enola found the explosives factory it was still a detective movie, but from that point onward it changes course to romance.Still it's an ok movie, good visuals and production.

818,nitinnain,Over acting,2,26 October 2020,"Over-acting by almost everyone, but specially the young lead and her love interest. This whole thing of actors talking to the camera and explaining what they are thinking is just so overdone. It was funny in Deadpool, but just that.
Also over-complicated plot. Puzzles are fun, only when there is some sense in them and they are approachable. Whatever they've tried to do here is several times more complicated than a calculus class. I don't even know if it makes any sense.
Unnecessary CGI. Much of this could have been done without any CGI.
They basically threw all random movie making ideas into the movie. If this is in somehow empowering for woman, cause of the female lead case, then well that's a weak reason. It doesn't have any original thought and you don't get anything at the end.",Enola Holmes

The mystery that follows was dull and uninteresting. Every supporting character was annoying and one dimensional.
On the plus side, the script occasionally gives us a laugh but nowhere near enough. It's saved by an electric performance by Millie Bobby Brown whose charisma and fourth wall breaking antics are the only thing that keep your attention.

It's not a Sherlock Holmes movie, and it isn't meant to be. Neither was ""Seven Percent Solution"" or the Downey movies. Many reviewers can't get past that, and a lot of them simply don't like women.
I've not read the books, but I enjoyed the movie; I hope there will be more. The actors, the settings, the story are fine. The only thing that is not resolved for me was that Eudoria was a a terrorist in the making.",Enola Holmes
828,scocasso,I was hoping for more,5,27 September 2020,"The costumes, sets, settings, etc. looked fantastic. It's a kid's movie, so I wasn't very invested in historical accuracy, I can overlook that as long as the story, dialogue, etc. is good. I mean, hey, we all have an imagination and at one time we were meant to watch actors on a stage with a painted backdrop and imagine they were in a castle, or in a field, it's really all about the story and the acting for me and all else is merely fluff. Don't get me wrong, I love eye-candy, and there is a lot of that in this movie. I was looking forward to a good mindless adventure where Sherlock and his brother were mainly background characters, so again, I didn't invest much in those two characters, I wanted to follow this girl on her adventure.At the onset we learn she was raised by a single mother (widowed) who never worked, but revealed later, lived on the financial support of one of her two brothers (who both abandoned her). Yet, she's portrayed as a strong independent woman. She raises her daughter, training her as if raising her to be Jane Bond in weapons, hand-to-hand combat, world knowledge, etc., but to what end? Oh, sorry, not Jane Bond, Joan of Arc. In the first two minutes there were already hints of 'we can do and be anything we want here,' (even dress up as men) but not... outside of this estate. I thought that this would play into the societal expectations of her and make her into an outsider to normal society, which might make for interesting interactions with the outside world. But instead, that's not what they made of this. They were laying the foundations for something else.It turns out that her mother's secret was that she is a government agent and a spy... ha ha, no, nothing so interesting, it turns out that her mother is a terrorist, plotting something which requires multiple bombs. Why? ""Perhaps she wants to change the world,"" speculates Sherlock. ""Perhaps it's a world that needs changing,"" replies Enola. What are they talking about? They don't say, specifically, but we already saw a bundle of flyers for ""Women's Suffage"" and Enola looks at the camera with a sly smile as if to say, ""Ooh yeah!!"" Ah, when that was revealed, it was all too much, all of the foolish bumbling stupid inept male characters fall right into place. All of the remarks about female clothing being a prison, and having to go to a finishing school, well, putting her in a prison within a prison. All of the gendered remarks and inferences... oh, we were rolling our eyes as this ball rolled on getting larger and larger as it went. Her mother was a suffragette, and of course ""they"" (the police) were looking for her, because she was likely responsible for bombings which may or may not have killed people. What a hero. This movie is trying to rewrite history, but careful not to say much outright. It's all blatant inferences.Men were not allowed to vote, that was left up to the aristocracy. Even up to 1918, not all men could vote, only property owners. Eventually, men and women who served in the armed forces were allowed to vote (those that survived, that is). Eventually, it was extended to all men in 1918, but not all women, because men were obligated to fight and die for their country in exchange for voting rights, women were not obligated to fight and die for their country, but voting rights were extended to women who occupied a premises of a certain yearly value, and other women as well. It wasn't until 1928 that all women were able to vote. So, only ten years after all men were able to vote, and it was men that voted to allow all women to be able to vote without any obligation or responsibilities to their country, unlike men who do have such in exchange for their right to vote, to this very day. If men were really women hating misogynists and women really had no rights or freedoms etc. and were slaves to men... women would never get the right to vote, or any rights at all. Ridiculous fiction of which so many blatant hypocritical notions are evident in this movie.In fact, men were responsible for women. A single man, such as Sherlock, would be very much frowned upon and it would be very difficult to find any employment, as a single man is a man with no future, a man who is basically worthless and most importantly, a man who is not supporting a woman... not supporting his country. For every single man, there is a woman not being supported. These were very real pressures on men. A single man would also find it difficult to gain entry to university. If a woman committed a crime, the husband was responsible. He was responsible for her debts, her taxes, and even after divorce he was still responsible for her. Mycroft Holmes, as the elder brother, was legally responsible for Enola's mother, his sister, and that is why she never worked and he supported her financially all those years. Enola's mother COULD have worked, but why work when you don't have to? I wouldn't. Mycroft Holmes was a government employee, i.e. he had a job. He moved away to the city to work and in turn support Enola's mother. I also wouldn't feel comfortable taking someone's hard earned money and giving nothing in return.Anyway, it's just sad that Millie Bobby Brown (a 16 year old; a young impressionable teenager) is being indoctrinated into believing and spreading such misinformation about the past to her audience, many of whom are also young impressionable kids who might believe what they see in the movies to hold some truth.",Enola Holmes
829,harp369-763-840292,Enola is an Eleven,8,30 September 2020,"I didn't expect to be watching this movie with expectations of Sherlock Holmes being in the forefront - he's a secondary charector meant to be the provider of plot movitivation. Millie has matured and I am sure Helen Bonham-Carter must have taken her under her wing for a tad because I can see some similar expressions. I love the breaking the 4th wall expressions.

The premise is excellent and weaves into the Sherlock Holmes mythos surprisingly well. Perfect sort of film for an escapist indulgence that's relatively family friendly (there is some violence and adult themes). Essentially a mystery and adventure that is both fun and exciting. I suggest you give it a chance, IMHO I believe it'll be worth your time.",Enola Holmes
833,Tarannum-aiub,If Sherlocks sister existed she would definitely have ben like this,10,27 September 2020,"I like the nice touch of the Suffragette movement era. I liked how extraordinary Sherlocks mom was portrayed as. BTW the train scene is where the Hogwarts express was also shot at. You will know when you see it.
Yes Sherlock was a little more emotional than usual. But if a sister who had the wits like him existed he would definitely approve like he did in the movie. But Microft not so sure about him. Millys acting was spot on. Perfect casting.
Now on the plot the mystery it served for Enola to solve was pretty simple. I am thankful that Sherlock solved it before her figuring out to show that he is actually the same deductive man. Enola is learning as she is so young. I liked how she had a hint of emotional side and not so emotional and driven my task like her brother, but definitely not quite as stern as her brother. I love these two ladies. Its a great watch if you are in a mood for women empowering as well as a bit of classic British spice and sherlock vibes.",Enola Holmes

We can assume this is the time of importance in the suffrage movement between 1880 and 1918 where the British Empire was at its absolute height of power. Traditionalists were certainly within their righteousness to claim that times had never been better, yet equity in the vote, as most of us now know, was certainly the more noble cause. Yet, here and now, in our current time of upheaval, there is nothing more righteous than to remind us all that freedom of thought, understanding that politics DO matter, and simply loving and helping your fellow human will lead us to where we need to be.This film is a fun and uplifting period piece (minus the plastic shotgun cartridges) that concluded the smart plot toward of the value of caring for your fellow man and woman.",Enola Holmes

Also if the major plot twist was supposed to be a surprise they utterly failed, anyone with half a brain could see it coming. I know that all sounds harsh and not deserving of an 8, but they did make up for it. The movie was fun, fresh, exciting, and definitely made me laugh out loud at many points. The actors were wonderful, it was beautifully filmed, and as a huge Sherlock Holmes fan I was not disappointed with the portrayal.

839,leoribeirop,DONT LET THIS LOW GRADE DECEIVE YOU,9,23 September 2020,"Enola Holmes has a well-structured script, even without the objective of delivering a narrative from Sherlock, but from his sister. Harry Bradbeer managed to handle the breaking of the 4th wall very well, and the immense charisma of Millie Bobby Brown helped, at times was unnecessary, but at other times, it really helped the viewer not to get lost with so many things happening at the same time. Despite leaving a taste of wanting more from Sherlock, which is extremely well-portrayed by Henry Cavill, it is clear that Enola does not depend on him to unravel something and that she is completely capable of doing the job alone, which is also included in the incredible intelligence of the character throughout the entire trajectory during the course of the narrative. The protagonist and Louis Partdrige built a simply incredible chemistry with Enola and Lord, making the viewer hope too much for their final kiss, but still, the film does not deviate from its proposal and doesn't let the romance stays in the first place. DON'T LET THIS LOW GRADE DECEIVE YOU. Honestly, one of the best movies I've ever seen, super fun, and really light to watch it, I highly recommend it.",Enola Holmes

Any hint of joy was every time destroyed by the figuer of writer, whom I clearly saw behind every hero, lurking in the shadows or jumping at the screen and screaming about how much he or she hates one particular demographic group. The political slogans were inserted so stupidly and out of place that made me laugh. Like ""You'll be man when I'll tell you to be"". What?

Anyway, the film is good for people who appreciate family movies, but there's no mystery expected from the film starring the great SHERLOCK HOLMES.

Not the focus of this review. As someone who is a semester away from my film degree, I love watching movies and analyzing all of the parts that make it up.First, I'll start with the good. The cinematography, lighting, set dec, wardrobe, and props were very well done (although with a Netflix budget, they probably spared no expense). The camera work/placement was also pretty good. I could see the directors style in some of the shots, and some of it worked well. As a big fan of lighting and cinematography, they did a pretty good job with that too. The quick zoom in on the item they are focusing on is classic Sherlock Holmes.Now for the bad. What even is this story? We really had to wait until the last 5 minutes to find her mom? So many wild tangents in the story. They all tried to tie them in, but they fell flat. And Enola didn't really have a a good development arc. She started off pretty smart, witty, and skilled, and only mildly improved. Also, they were trying to make her a strong independent woman, but then totally 180-ed that with her romance, making her seem like a damsel in love. AND THE CAMERA NARRATION WAS SO POINTLESS!

Why is this so hard? I have read most of the Enola Holmes books and this story seems way off from the books. Sad because the books are pretty good. But the good news is Millie Bobby Brown has really blossomed into a very good actress and she saves the film. Congrats to Millie.",Enola Holmes

879,bwene1982,A superb adventure following the spitfire Holmes sister.,10,17 November 2020,Enola Holmes is exactly the protagonist our quarantine lives need. We learn immediately of her mother's disappearance which ignites Enola on an epic search to London. On this journey Enola runs into many curious characters each on their own journey of life. But Enola always recalls the training Mum provided making her one astute detective in training. Watch out Sherlock! Millie Bobby Brown excels as a strong young woman eager to flex her skills in the world. Feelings of hope & strength power this film forward. Highly recommended for a great night!,Enola Holmes
880,ciansable,A Safe and Clumsy Mystery,5,25 September 2020,"Enola Holmes plays it safe. It's a children's movie so we can forgive the writers / directors for that. But if you're going to play it safe, at least do it well. The dialogue was corny beyond belief, the acting was awkward and clumsy (probably because of the script) but worst of all, the mystery was unintriguing (probably not a word) and boring. The ciphers pretended to be sophisticated when they are the first thing you think of when you think of a clue. ""The numbers are letters,"" I mean come on. Use some imagination.Overall, it's semi-enjoyable but I wouldn't advise anyone to waste 2 hours. There must be a glitch or a touch of corruption in the Rotten Tomatoes server to give it a 93%. Even Metacritic's 63% baffles me.Maybe I'm missing something.",Enola Holmes

She should be a much stronger character. I hope they marry the main characters, and I would hope they do another movie and have her start her own detective agency and lead out solving mysteries and crimes, without much of her brother's help. In fact it would be great if Sherlock needed her.

If you want a relax movie with just a little bit of mystery, this is your go to, even when the middle of the movie turns a bit slow. Don't expect a Sherlock movie, this is the very lighter version of it. And, of course, it's a feminist movie but it's not forced as it often seems in tons of movies, so I aplaud it.",Enola Holmes
883,whatafox,Solid fun and acting,9,4 October 2020,"I think this deserves much more than the current 6.7 rating, myself my husband and my 15 year old daughter equally enjoyed it and we are not the Disney only type family, more of Wes Anderson fans and sci fi geeks. What some people consider shoehorned in feminist junk actually fits into the historical setting quite nicely. Give yourself a quick history lesson on women's suffrage in England it was violent and extreme to say the least.
This is in the lane of Anne With an E mixed with a bit of humor and although I usually hate breaking the fourth wall, Millie Bobby Brown is extremely competent and I didn't feel she was being too precocious which she seems to be in real life, and neither was she irritating. She's really coming along as a good little actress. Give it a chance and remember you may not be the target market but you can still enjoy it for what it is.",Enola Holmes

The movie was fun throughout, well-paced, well-staged, well-acted, and nice to look at with the period costumes and sets. I was surprised at how much I loved Sam Claflin in this role as Mycroft; I never would have thought to cast him as such a character, but he pulls it off perfectly. All the leads are charming and entertaining . . . and they add a nice bit of scenery, of course. I couldn't quite get over the casting of a younger actor for the older brother, though; to me it was obvious that Henry Cavill is older than Claflin, and it kept throwing me off. Each performed wonderfully in their roles, though, so I can't completely fault the casting choices. I wasn't a huge fan of how feeling they had Sherlock's character here, it didn't feel true to the Sherlock of his books, but I'm willing to overlook that as being nitpicky on my part.
I would recommend this movie to anyone who isn't a staunch film critic. It's witty and fun.",Enola Holmes

To follow in Enolas footsteps you should be beautiful, rich, with an high IQ and an offspring of an aristocratic family.

893,ashishchandra-55347,Charming!,8,24 September 2020,"'Tis delightful watching anything to do with Sherlock Holmes. All the more so when there is a dimension added that you have never heard of before. A sister. Sherlock Holmes had a sister and a brother. Gosh, I presumed that his only family were his best friend Watson and his fans around the world. But there's a surprise for me right there! All the more delightful when you learn that Millie Bobby Brown, AKA El, is playing his sister named Enola, which when read backwards, reads Alone.
Well, this movie isn't about Sherlock at all as the title suggests. It brings into play tricky issues of the then topics like feminism, women empowerment, their subjugation and so forth. Clearly, Enola escapes the subjugation quite magnificently and in style, one which even impresses her virtuoso genius brother, Sherlock, not so much her obnoxious brother Mycroft, a name which sounds more like the name of some landmine.
To be honest, you might find the character of Sherlock underplayed. You won't see the eccentricities or the spectacularly outlandish charm that Holmes (Sherlock) is known for, but as stated before, he movie aint about him. So set your expectations straight. And prepare to be swept off your feet by the enormous charms of the lovely Enola Holmes.",Enola Holmes

Only to cash in on the whole Holmes popularity. Rather would have been less disappointing had they not linked it to Holmes.Acting isn't half bad but Henry Cavill is a wastes opportunity.Watch this movie while browsing Instagram or Facebook or playing games or washing utensils, good to have some noise in the background.Otherwise, avoid it, you're not missing out on anything noteworthy.",Enola Holmes

I don't believe this was a hard core feminism movement movie it has hardcore elements, yes (which the reviews have portrayed). But everything was enjoyable. Great for kids.

Movie did not have a clear storyline. They made Sherlock Holmes look like an absolute idiot. The first scene siblings share the screen together disappointed me so much. Sherlock and mycroft keep asking obvious questions (according to their intellectual level) from Enola without even doing the infamous deduction thingy?? What a garbage.

919,okromesburg,Great film but was the fourth dimension really necessary?,7,26 September 2020,"I found the film as a whole to be very intriguing. I am a huge fan of Sam Claflin, I also really enjoy Helena Bonham Carter. I have seen Millie Bobbie Brown in Stranger Things and enjoyed her performance.I found it very interesting to see Sam Claflin play a villain character and not going to lie it doesn't suit him. I think he is very much the actor that you cast for a character you want the audience to fall in love with an root for.I also found Enola's relationship with the boy(whose name I'm not going to even try to spell) to be very familiar. After thinking about it for a little I realized it was the same relationship as Jo and Laurie from the book(which was later made into two films) Little Women.The thing I really didn't like about this film though is the four dimension effect. It very much reminded me of when I was a little kid and I was watching Dora and she asked me where the bad guy was. I think the film as a whole was fantastic. But this really killed it for me. The movie is Rated PG-13 it is not made for children, and I honestly find it kind of degrading to the audience. I personally didn't enjoy it as it seems others have. I felt that a voice over would have fit much better for the film.As a whole the film was very well written(with the exception of fourth dimension)and the acting was phenomenal.",Enola Holmes

It's written with a decent amount of jokes, the mystery is just about easy enough to solve for an older kid and the key characters are entertaining.

Then she loses boy and dresses as girl to find her mom who also has run from home. She loses interest in finding mom and decides to find boy which she does in a minute (Sherlock sister.. duh!) then they start running away from whoever is trying to find them! I could go on and on...jujitsu 300 years back.. black females running cafes during that period.. this movie is one gigantic mess! I have insomnia and slept like twice during the viewing and eventually couldn't finish the movie. Love Milly Bobby brown but this movie is crap... stay away!,Enola Holmes

Funny and brilliant character she brought to life, really engaging story, supporting cast was awesome. You can tell from the trailer it was going to a fun and different take on the Sherlock legacy, focusing on his younger sister. Millie talking directly to the viewers was also fun to watch, with her speaking into the camera was similar to The Office. There were many serious and dramatic moments, both emotional and visual. The villains were well portrayed, those actors made you fear and hate them. If they make a series I'll watch every episode! Nicely done.",Enola Holmes

951,koalay,A delightful young adult fantasy story,8,24 September 2020,"A light paced, funny, young adult fiction adaptation about a talented girl, Enola Holmes, getting to know and adapt to the real world.It does make effort to look and feel historically authentic (with the clothes, the make up, the props and etc). But in the most important part, it took some liberty in rewriting bits to make it a more empowering story for young women. And why not? It's a fantasy story for youngsters.It tells a young person to define oneself and to fight for the weak. It has a little bit of mystery, adventure, action. It adds a little bit of romantic touch to the plot. And it has a talented cast who committed to the characters and the story. That's pretty much I'd ask back in my early-teens.BTW, there is an abundant of even more absurd young films and fictions available. If you have problem with this one being girl-oriented, there are more than enough for you out there. Simply move on to find yourself another tree.As a used-to-be Holmes fan, the biggest nitpick for me is Mycroft. Mycroft is dumb down a lot so he can be a villainous character here (The canon books describes him to be even better in deduction than Shelock. He's just not as keen in field work as his younger brother). But again, its a rewrite aimed for younger people. I'll give it a pass.Overall, I enjoy the ride. It reminds me of being a younger soul. I'd love to see a sequel of it.",Enola Holmes

The potential here is so strong and would be a wonderful family mystery, drama series that all could enjoy. Don't get my wrong this was highly enjoyable, and left me craving more right away. Thus my desire for it to a streaming series. Binge worthy. For the cry babies upset it wasn't accurate, IT WAS A FICTIONAL MOVIE BASED ON FICTIONAL CHARACTERS they could have had a unicorn in the movie if they wanted. (Spoiler: they don't) So crying because it's not accurate is just a waste of time honestly. As a parent this was a really good family movie.

954,dawidbalaz,Great casual entertainig movie you should give a try and skip only if you are die hard Sherlock fan,10,26 September 2020,"So without spoilers:Enola just from the title focuses on her and not sherlock for you fans there. It's also targetting a demographic of a family watching or everyone who is to be entertained.And this movie does it perfectly. There was no point in the movie that I'd feel bored and it's the little touches where there doesn't need to be a dialogue just a facial expression that you have to be carefully watching in order to understand the whole message of the movie and its focus.4th wall breaking across the whole duration adds a little touch and you do really feel into the main character if you are watching thoroughly. It's in no way a serious Sherlock movie and for a really tough Sherlock fan you better go watch 2009 Robert Downey Jr.'s Sherlock as in my opinion he does a far better ""Sherlock"" Job.Anyhow even though Sherlock is absolutely different for how he should be portrayed it just fits in this a little twisted Sherlock world. And to do justice with the script that I believe has only one point to entertain the audience Henry Cavil does as ever a great job as does the whole cast!To summ it up:At first I thought going into this, that it will be just a ""low budget"" Sherlock movie with some twisted character portrayal and I would just dislike it as a whole,..It... it just wasn't the case at all!I genuinely enjoyed it for the whole duration with a mindset that this may be some side universe of Sherlock and with that in mind ( Sherlock hard fan turned off) I very much liked it and will recommend it to anyone who really isn't a die hard Sherlock fan.And for those kind of people this movie is 10/10Cheers and have a great time.",Enola Holmes

Yes it does have a feminist theme but I can't see how that detracts from the story. The story of Enola Holmes is one of a girl coming into her own. It also shows how girls did not have much say in how there life should be handled, it was always at the behest of their male relatives. There is a mystery or two for her to solve and there is a bit of romance. Overall a nice get away from the world today. Plus it has Henry Cavill as Sherlock Holmes who plays an enlightened character in this movie.",Enola Holmes

I found the ""breaking the 4th wall"" aka talking to the camera a bit distracting from the story. While I was watching the movie my 10-year old son walked into the room for about 2 minutes and first thing he asked is ""why is she talking to the camera""? It felt a bit Ferris Bueller-ish.
I like the casting and the story. Felt more like a series rather than a movie. Good start to something that could grow.",Enola Holmes
965,robert-kroess,Waste of time,3,4 October 2020,"To say it clearly: For me it was a pure waste of time. It's a movie made for children (12-15), but was advertised differently.

966,stjohn-lorca,"Overstated, saccharin fun for the whole family, but not for feminists or ACD fans",2,2 October 2020,"Apart from an obvious vehicle for Brown, I was unable to find any point to this tedious, poorly paced and poorly scripted film. The feminist message is as subtle as the clichés of Victorian England, strong-willed women and fourth-wall breaks that are regurgitated at the audience at every possible opportunity, to the point of tedium. Liberal reinterpretations and adaptations of Conan Doyle's beloved character can be and have been artfully and cleverly done, but the supposed sister of the legendary Sherlock and Mycroft in this version is simply a pretty martial arts dilettante who dabbles a little in word puzzles and relies on the gauche, predictable and transparent plot, rather than intellectual prowess or observation, to solve mysteries no more challenging than those tackled by the Famous Five. Her opponents are cut-out caricatures rather than anything against which she can really test her mettle. From a movie with a feminist message in 2020 I expect more than Mary Poppins with an uppercut and a couple of famous relatives. Nobody seemed to be comfortable with the script that lurched through a stilted pastiche of pseudo-Victorian English or in the sumptuous but unconvincing design.
Superficially charming family viewing, but do not expect subtlety, humour, accuracy or intellectual stimulation.",Enola Holmes

970,kalin500,Needs pruning,5,27 September 2020,"In this drought lately, for good movies, I decided to give this movie a chance.
After reading the comments about the feminist orientation of the film, I was warned and managed to watch it more or less tolerably by skipping the girl's monologues and some other moments (for example with the martial arts coach). If someone bothers to cut about 30 minutes of the film, it will become something bearable to watch. Henry Cavill plays the role very well.",Enola Holmes

974,georgianapetu,Better watch Anne with an E,3,20 December 2020,"For me it falls in the same cathegory as Anne with an E. The exeption being that Anne with an E is a complete masterpiece and a work of art, that makes you feel as if you live all these adventurous tales together with the characters.
On the other hand, Enola Holmes wants to be similar to Anne with an E, it's also about a young woman trying to find herself in the world, but it's much more dull. It would've had an enormous potential, but unfortunately it's just boring. And it doesn't make me care about any of the characters.",Enola Holmes

976,michellehuettl,Fabulous YA Film,9,3 January 2021,"First, this film is charming as hell, though I do find the direct to camera narration a bit unpleasant. That's my personal preference though.While some plot points are predictable, there's enough to keep even avid story-consumers entertained. That being said, viewers should recognize the target audience is youth to young adult. (An adult adaptation of this story would be amazing to see, too.) Many don't seem to realize this is based on a young adult book series, interestingly.Now, to address the complaints most have.The Purity of Sherlock Holmes: Most of the complainers act like Arthur Conan Doyle was some sort of god whose work has never been tainted-which is ridiculous if you actually know him, his life, and his work. There are for worse invocations of his characters. This is a delightful twist and honestly has little to do with the originals, which is just fine. The Sherlock character is also clearly early in his career, so most of the complainers also miss that obvious point.PC/""Me Too""/Feminism Messages: To be fair, if you're against equality and equity with gender, you won't like this film because the story highlights the idea that inequity and inequality are wrong. (This is also a common failing of Holmes stories, so I find this particularly relevant to the whiners mentioned above.) Additionally, anyone who brings up ""#metoo"" dismissively really should just stop talking in general and here in particular. This has absolutely nothing to do with the movement to empower survivors of sexual assault by sharing experiences and creating a culture of accountability. While that is clearly a noble and worthwhile cause that highlights pervasive cultural issues, this film is about a young woman in a world with clear and strict limits on what a woman should be.",Enola Holmes

Once I realized this was a feminist movie I Gabe it more grace because I knew it be preachy. Even the way she paused to talk to the audience (yes this did happen all throughout the movie) made it harder to connect more. That fell flat. I thought Henry Cavill and the other brother did very well. And yes I thought she did okay too but there were just things in the movie that one didn't make sense, we're too far fetched, and just didn't fit. The line that she used on the guy and the way she protected the love interest just didn't seem like reality. I get it I get it: it's a movie. Not real. Even still it just didn't work. That last line was the nail in the coffin. At that point my wife and I paused the film to see how much we had left to go for it just to end.",Enola Holmes

The plot is weird, that she goes on an adventure with a noble kid and somewhat developed feeling for him?, but wasn't her goal was to find her mother in the beginning? In the end she didn't find her mother, more like her mother show up out of nowhere and give us audience another heavy blows of feminism... her mothers role is to a symbol about woman rights, but woman do have rights right now (I'm not getting into the detail that some part of woman's right can be better), so what's the point of this movie? if you want to have a movie intend to audience for children (which I totally think it is), may I suggest you throw out the political correctness?I personally don't see why Henry Cavill is casted for this supporting role, but I guess they need an A name on the list to attract audience, but overall having a strong actor like Cavill on a supporting role feel like it shifts away focus from the main protagonist. I'll not get into detail of how this writer has zero respect for Sir Conan Doyle's work, the rewrite of Mycroft and Sherlocks personality is horrible.overall, I think the cast did their job well, but i do not recommend this movie as I'm unsure of what I'm watching, and I feel like this is an unnecessary movie for political correctness.",Enola Holmes

993,jloughreyy,"Disappointing, but an enjoyable watch.",7,24 September 2020,"Enola HolmesSINS* Poor casting, Henry Cavill is not Sherlock Holmes in the slightest, he's not eccentric, he's too good looking it didn't work for me at all and really dampened my viewing experience.
* Sherlock and Mycroft were really poor characters, they were so cliche and brought nothing of value into the story.
* Story just seems a bit lost, the overall mystery is very dull and unengaging, it also tries at romance, comedy, action, period, feminism and class. it's trying to be too much that what feels like the heart of the film (the mystery) is often overlooked and loses meaning.
* It's silly that no proper romance ever occurred between Enola and Tewkesbury, it obviously should have happened.
* I don't think MBB nailed all of the speak-to-the-camera parts, not everyone can be Phoebe Waller-Bridge, sometimes it just made me cringe.
* Was undeniably too long, the over-filled plot didn't help here.
* Inconsistent historical accuracy bugged me.WINS* Enola and Tewkesbury were very enjoyable, very well acted, good chemistry.
* It was a very fun film, visually - I actually enjoyed the style in the end.
* Enola was a very good character. She isn't just Sherlock but a girl, she is her own character and she's well written.VERDICTLight hearted, fun and entertaining to watch but the story was extremely disappointing and the familiar characters were executed very poorly.

It was just enough #metoo in my opinion. Why can't we allow children today watch a movie based in a period hundreds of years ago that paints a world more inclusive of woman. I happen to enjoy almost any movie with a strong female lead as long as it is done well and this movie has so much to enjoy!Millie Bobbi Brown gives me young Natalie Portman vibes, she has charisma and never breaks character, I didn't see one weak scene where she didn't hold my attention. The script was smart, comical and sassy and avoided the pitfalls of movies like Deadpool 2 which annoyingly felt like an extended Jimmy Carr standup show. (1.5hrs of one liner after one liner) Like Deadpool 2, this movie breaks the fourth wall throughout and it never got annoying.Props to the young marques who I have never seen in anything else but easily held his own and reminded me of Brenton Thwaites.

She is (like most successful women before and after her) unwilling to 'fit-in' to accepted and expected behaviour- restricted by confining corsets metaphorically speaking- and in these times of uncertainty and gloom Enola Holmes takes you through the woods, charming steam engine trains & busy gritty London streets through a journey of self discovery!

1004,chriswhite-63881,What's not to like,8,24 September 2020,"So seems a polarised view between like and not like and I ask the question what not to like? It's a historical drama adapted from a very masculine story but pitched particularly at a teenage female/family audience so not an easy task.At that to some very topical themes around inequalities, patriarchy, racism, sexism and it makes a very good stab at introducing these themes in a fun and entertaining way without minimising or trivalizing or turning off a teenage audience.So I would say well done. Millie Bobbie Brown is a fun female protagonist and remains excellent teenage role model. If you didn't like it ask yourself why? Maybe the social/political themes did rest easy with you. Maybe you wanted something more serious or more classical. May be you are not a teenage girl. Millie Bobbie Brown and Enola Holmes are much needed feminine heroes.",Enola Holmes
1005,kalischroeder,Why all the bad reviews?,9,10 February 2021,"At first I was a little skeptical about this movie. I didn't really know what it was going to be about but I ended up really liking it and was genuinely surprised. Enola Holmes is generally a movie for female teens and young adults, but I actually think that this movie is for a much bigger audience. This movie features female empowerment along with mystery and a bit of romance. I understand that this may not be like a Sherlock Holmes movie with solving clues and riddles but this is still really good! Millie Bobby Brown preformed amazing in this movie, and it's definitely a must watch in my opinion. The acting was decent and in the end you really start to like the characters! This movie may not be for all Sherlock fans, but if you have an open mind to a clever feel good movie, I would 100% recommend!",Enola Holmes

She made this movie a very fun and clever ride, full of women power and social activism. Also a big fan of Henry Cavill as Sherlock Holmes. I loved all the quips and the fight scenes were well executed. I thought that giving Enola a love interest in the young Lord was a bit cliché but I ended up growing to like their budding relationship. The mystery aspect of the movie was well done, what else could I expect from a Sherlock Holmes movie! There's certainly a lot of potential for sequels in the future and I'm looking forward to hopefully a follow up movie about Enola's mother and her plan that involved the explosives.

Although, I have heard a few say that Henry Cavill's Sherlock was too emotional, I don't care! I liked his little bit of emotion. Miss Brown did such a good job. I am not sure how historically accurate the jujitsu was with the women in that time period. I think it was supposed to give the audience a sense of hope for the oppression of the women of that time. If I was younger I might be interested in the books that the movie is based off. I like the little love story that seems to be put on hold until the teenagers are a bit older.",Enola Holmes
1013,Movies_n_chill,Nice pass time,8,24 September 2020,"Brief introduction:
I was quite excited to watch this movie but did not go into it with a lot of expectations. The story begins with Enola introducing us to her life and how she was raised by her mother. Soon we come to know that the 'Holmes' siblings have united because there is a problem at hand. Each one of them is trying to deal with this newly arrived situation using the best of their capabilities. Enola , however has been brought up in a way where she can survive on her own and does not need to fit into the ideals that society has set up for woman in order to have a happy and successful future. She is thus unable to accept the reality of the situation and sets out on a mission to find out more for her self. Not everything goes as she hoped for but nonetheless she discovers a few important things about herself on the way which is great for her.
Review:
The story keeps moving with pace and we can see a lot of activity on screen. Despite being intriguing in itself,the film does lose grip on the viewers at times.Nevertheless the characters are likeable and well portrayed. The mystery is satisfying too.The depiction of Victorian England might not be very accurate but nonetheless it suits the narrative well.
Actors :
Millie Bobby Brown is very convincing and lovable in the role of a budding detective and almost gives her elder brother a competition in this department. Henry Cavell is charming as Sherlock Holmes and I liked the film's take on this legendary character. All the other actors have done good justice to their roles as well.
Overall:
The clues, ciphers and witty banters make the detective story quite enjoyable.Enola Holmes is sure to charm her way into your heart too just as she does with the characters in this film!",Enola Holmes
1014,wvrknau,a wonderful Millie Bobby Brown,8,24 September 2020,"I rated Enola Holmes 08 out of 10 stars.I would even have forgiven 10 stars if the story had focused more on the initial core (finding the mother and the airing of your secret). But I don't want to reveal anything here either......only one thing: ""Henry Cavill"" is great, you would have seen more of ""Helena Bonham Carter"" and ""Millie Bobby Brown"" is just grandiose. If she continues like this, she will play everybody against the wall.",Enola Holmes

I like the message given in the film: Women are powerful and if they wish, they can change the world. I don't get why the rating is so low.This may be because men do not want to see powerful women around. I like the acting and the scenario fulfilled my expectations. It is a fun movie which I needed in these hard days.",Enola Holmes
1017,radoslawjakubiak,A beautifully disguised Mary Sue,5,26 September 2020,"TLDR: While it does a pretty good job at pretending it just a well-made teen action movie, it is a political statement. I gave it 5 stars because of great production value and good cast. It is all form and no substance, which is a shame - it could have been a lot more.In short, Enola is a little Wonderwoman/Ray. 16 years old, never outside of her home, ""trained"" by her loony mother, no formal education whatsoever. With no real life experience she manages to do great in London (which was a vicious place at the time). As a superhuman being that pretty much all of modern female characters seem to be, she is perfect from the start, makes no mistakes and does not need to grow or learn. First ever real fight, against an experienced hired killer no less? She not only outwits him (which could make sense since he might have underestimated her coginitive abilities - a teen is still a child you know), but also manages to fight him off in hand-to-hand combat and ultimately kills him. Not only is this completely unrealistic, but since the movie is so set on ""empowerment"" and ""girl power"", it gives young girls a bad and in all honesty very dangerous idea: that they can stand their ground against an older, experienced, way stronger and male opponent. It is simply not the case, no matter how many hours you've clocked on your martial arts classes. It simply does not work that way, period.What Will You Learn Whilst Watching Enola:1. Terrorism is fine if you do it for the right reasons. Bombing public spaces and possibly killing innocent people for the sake of feminist ""progress""? Totally fine.2. Being average is bad, you always need to ""find your own way"". Apparently finding a good husband and having a nice life is an appalling idea.3. Order is bad, everybody should just do whatever they want and it will all be fine4. ""Secret"" female-only martial arts classes led by a black woman (that is very black-panthery by the way, but who cares) were a thing apparently. Also, how could they be kept a secret if they organised them on the floor just above a posh pattiserie/cafe? It was extremely noisy and even made the lamp swing wildly. Wouldn't such establishments be frequented by high ranking policemen, politicians and the like? Would nobody notice? Actually, now that I think of it: who would willingly go there if they had to suffer the constant noise while eating their cake and drinking coffee? Wouldn't you go to a quieter place?5. Enola is smarter than Sherlock, despite having no experience in basically anything6. Scotland Yard police officers were idiots7. Corsets can protect you against stabbing!8. A young and attractive girl could just wander around back alleys of Victorian London and nobody would ever bother her9. Want to avoid raising suspicion? Dress up as a widow. Apparently nobody would remember a 16-year old attractive girl already being a widow.10. Training, discipline and learing from your mistakes are for losers.11. All men are incompetent, blundering fools that have no idea what they are doing.Also, at the end of the movie, Enola's mother congratulates her as if it was her that made the new progressive bill pass. But she didn't do anything - it was the people she never even met (men by the way!) voting that did the job. Why did she just accept praise for something she didn't do? What kind of example does that set?",Enola Holmes

1022,batmanwookie,I'm in the middle with this one,6,8 April 2021,"I'll start by saying that this isn't a bad movie. In fact it's on the better side of some movies now a days. The casting was very good and The actors portrayed The characters very well. The problem is that I was expecting a movie in the world of Sherlock Holmes and while the time frame is correct the characters and story was changed significantly. My biggest complain was Mycroft. He was portrayed as a man who thinks that women should pretty much be in charge at all times. Another problem is that the story is about a bunch of people keeping Ebola down. Also the story was lost half way through the story. Ebola starts out trying to find her mother but changes the point of the movie in pretty much one scene. The biggest issue is the fact that she didn't solve the mystery on her own. The main villian pretty much said ""hey I am the villian, not the person that you thought it was for the whole adventure."" All that said it is a interesting tale and has good characters. Milly Bobby Brown did very well with Ebola and I loved her relationship the boy she is with the whole movie.

1024,Emii_G,millie bobby brown's overrated acting in a disappointing film.,2,26 September 2020,"While this film was a laughable excuse of an attempt to create a cheeky, contrasting and humorous spin-off movie (which breaks the 4th wall more times than necessary. When used correctly it can be very effective and funny *cough* Fleabag *cough*. However, this movie felt like an episode of Dora the explorer) set in the 19th century, this failed attempt was nothing compared to Millie Bobby Brown's failed attempt to be a mature actress. As well as her performance being cringe worthy, it is almost as though she refused to try and make the movie feel like it was set in the 19th century. Although she is not meant to be a sophisticated ""lady"" she acts as though she is acting in a movie set in modern times. Her performance struggled to get in touch with the character's feelings due to her stiff performance and inability to develop an accent which would coincide with enola's mother's accent. It was like she was saying her lines and not acting them.Some of the camera shots and framing decisions, didn't help the movie already feeling like it wasn't set in the 19th century, at times, either. The movie also shames women who did want the ""transitional"" lifestyle and makes it feel as though the women were foolish for wanting to dress like that. This alongside the movie trying to mirror current events, to do with injustice, in a movie which is meant to be a time period movie, makes everything feel forced. Yes, there are many discussions that needed to be had but they didn't portray the real problems of that time, while also spreading myths of corsets.The relationship between Enola and her love interest also felt extremely forced, as did the way she discovered her mother's clues. While you can see what the movie was trying to achieve, with its caricature-istic feel, the movie flops in this aspect. It feels over done, out of place at times and the ending (where they tried to have that typical encouraging ending, where the main character has the last word) was just unnecessary and didn't feel professional while it was repetative of her introduction.+ However, the performance form most of the other actors were convincing (Helena Bonham Carter, the roles of sherlock and Mycroft). The production value and visuals were impressive, but wasted due to bad directing choices and casting choices (casting certain people just because of pop culture).",Enola Holmes
1025,fanouraki_niki,Save it for next time...,4,27 September 2020,"(The movie is a fun watch for when bored, with a lot of clever ideas. There are parts that I would have enjoyed if i wasn't an immense Sherlock Holmes fan. This review is based on MY point of view which I do not claim that is the best one.)
Enola Holmes is not the worst movie, but there is a big (huge) space for improvements. The storyline had potentials, especially as far as the mother-daughter bond is concerned. I found some parts totally unnecessary and others clever, but not well-expressed.
First of all, the political aspect of the film could have been reached in much more depth in many ways. Enola was a young girl brought up to be a promising fighter in the war between women and society itself. Martial arts and tomboy manners aren't enough to express this exception. It would have been probably better if we saw Enola actually interacting with powerful older men, so that the contrast is even more distinguishable. In this case, the Duke's uncle scene wasn't adequate and the hired murderer served no political meaning.
Enola's relationship with her brothers was rather exaggerated and boring, not to mention written-in-a-borED-way. Mycroft was purposelessly distant and strict and Sherlock absolutely uninvolved, but in the end seemed really thoughtful (it was all mixed and baffling). I understand that the movie tried to focus on men's pressure on women and it's clear that some exaggerated parts were created for point-making reasons. Nonetheless, Enola being so repressed to enter the boarding school by the Holmes brothers was kind of contradicting and senseless, in my opinion.
Apart from all that, when having SUCH a masterpiece as a background (forever thankful to Arthur Conan Doyle) you can't but take advantage of it! Sherlock followers and the majority of the ones who watched the film probably couldn't wait to ""meet"" the mystery portrayed and Enola's (or hers and her brothers') genius way of solving it. The plot was really poor in this field as the extraordinary roles of Sherlock and Mycroft were HARDLY used, and Enola's inherited talent wasn't featured as a priority at all.
The character of the young lady's love affair was rationally created, as it provokes interest to anyone and it was received as a chance to turn the roles of the ""prince-saving-the-girl"" stereotype (which has also turned into a stereotype, but what can you say). What I found really unnecessary was the scene where the boy is being shot, but isn't dead after all... it was a waste of time and dignity. His backstory, moreover, was slightly mentioned, not to keep the mystery, but as a sign of bored writing. The ""plot-twist"" about the murder attempts was not such a twist, as he would have been killed for the same reason Enola had assumed earlier. The only difference was the family member behind all this, big deal... Tewkesbury and Enola's ending (and duration) , after all, was absolutely indifferent. I recognize the need of the writers to have the girl end up with no man's support, but their ending could have been a chance to prove this indifference wrong.
The mum-daughter bond problems start with the fact that the mum should have known the chance of her daughter's pressure form her brothers! I mean, wouldn't she know her son's moves since he takes over his sister's custody? It was a stupid move of the mother, so the whole plot based on this move isn't intriguing at all, to me... Their getting back together was also pretty awkward to watch, since we hadn't see them together in the present before and they were both quite distant. Personally, I wasn't persuaded that the mother's motives were the ones mentioned when she apologized nor were Enola's...
The cast was really badly matched to the roles, unfortunately. Helen B. Carter was misused, as she's one of the most talented actresses of all time, but was given a poorly written role... The amazing role of Mycroft has nothing to do with Sam Claflin's- which I adore- interpretation and Henry Cavill seemed like he didn't know who the heck that Sherlock guy the he was playing is. Millie Bobbie Brown played quite decently, but she could have been even better. The acting quality was bad in many scenes, but I can't understand whose fault that is...
All in all, the whole idea of a third Holmes child is really very interesting and smart, but this attempt went wrong... I strongly believe that the main cause of this failure is the much-promising background of the storyline, so no hard feelings!

While you shouldn't expect any degree of profundity, the film had little intentions of providing it. A playful rendition of a young and incorrigible woman's inner journey, intertwined with the indomitable spirit of the Suffragette movement, Enola Holmes is a refreshing addition to the family of detective royalty. Aesthetically pleasing and well-shot, the viewer is convincingly whisked away into the prim and proper Victorian era. The always vivacious Millie Bobby Brown is well-cast and delightful in her role.

I really enjoyed the setting, the costumes and the music during the movie. The acting was also very good, even though I could not imagine henry cavill as sherlock before! It is important to take the movie not too seriously and take it as what it is and here we have the first problem. From the trailer and the marketing it is not surprising that people expected something more mysterious and more sherlock holmes related. Well it is not. It is a light-hearted film about a girl finding herself and who she is in the world. The story is not bad, it is just a little all over the place. There are some clichés and predictable moments and in general i thought the romance part was a little unnecessary, but considering that I am maybe not the target age-group I can overlook that.
Overall it was a well-made movie with a story that lacked a little suspense and direction but I am sure my 14-year-old self would have enjoyed it a lot, so I think many other teenage girls (and boys) will do that as well.6.5/10",Enola Holmes

On the positive side, MBB was terrific and the production sumptuous. However the script was pretty awful and often beggared belief.I'm not sure why the story had to be set in the world of Sherlock Holmes at all, instead of a standalone story of a strong female character during the Victorian era. It's as if the writers had to borrow credibility from those well-established male characters, which kinda undermines the whole notion of emancipation.",Enola Holmes

1053,rkritika1508,Entertaining but superficial,6,29 May 2021,"This is a popcorn movie. I like the premise of it being an extension to Sherlock Holmes. But, this movie didn't do justice to either Sherlock or Mycroft. Conan Doyle and the British TV show both have shown these characters in rigorous detail, focusing on the different aspects of their personality. In this movie, however, the older Holmes siblings are a shadow of who they really areEnola Holmes, as a character, seems really promising. But the plot was too weak, her actions like that of a typical teenager and we are expected to think of her as the female version of Sherlock. Millie Bobby Brown has definitely done a good job of portraying her, but there were too many plot holes to make this a movie worth watching.Another criticism is the failed attempt of a brewing romance between Tewkesbury and Enola. The makers tried really hard to make a simmering romance, providing us with memorable moments. But, I didn't feel it added any value to the story itself.I believe there could have been more exploration of who Enola as a individual really is, rather than filling the movie with multiple subplots. I get that she is different from girls her own age, but, I wanted to see more aspects of her personality come up. Both Sherlock and Mycroft were just adornments, providing the movie with some necessary publicity, but could have been used way more.Helena Bonham Carter was definitely the saving grace, beautifully taking on the role of a woman who is a liberal thinker, not scared of the consequences and trying to bring up a revolution. In short, the characters were interesting and needed more finesse, but, the movie was definitely an entertaining watch.",Enola Holmes
1054,natashapartridgebusiness,Wish it was better,6,13 December 2020,"I found Enola Holmes a good watch although I cannot say I'd watch it again. The film had a good plot line although I found it was poorly executed. The cast was amazing and acted very well although things like poor cinematography, long and boring dialogue sections when Ebola broke the fourth wall and not so great editing at times made this film at points hard to watch. The rest of the film was great such as how they fitted the film perfectly into the Sherlock world and costumes and props fitted well into the 1800's theme.

1057,thedevious,"""Fun for the family (not for the fandom).""",6,5 February 2021,"This film stirred up a lot of drama on release and got a bad reputation for it. Much of the noise centered on the historical reimagining that the filmmakers reveled in, which many reviewers took offense to, while another factor that offended viewers was Cavill's portrayal of Sherlock Holmes as both polite and all-too fallible. Both of these issues are unfounded.The first is unfounded because Enola Holmes in no way presents itself as historical fiction. It's a comedy-adventure film based on a series of stories about a fictional detective. Expecting accuracy here is like expecting it from The Death of Stalin. The second is unfounded because, put simply, this isn't really a Sherlock Holmes film, and were Sherlock as preternaturally intelligent as he is in Doyle's stories, he'd completely overshadow the lead (which is generally not a good thing.)Visually, the film looks great, with beautiful sets and locations, and a wonderful array of period costumes. Brown's performance really carries the film, especially in the more lighthearted moments. The other cast members were also impressive, though I did find the acting somewhat stilted during the film's exposition-heavy ""serious"" scenes.This film's issues mainly stem from its overreliance on expository dialogue. It forcibly leads viewers around by the nose, treating its audience like fools all while being about as predictable as the key change in a pop song. While the 4th wall shenanigans are occasionally funny, they start to slip into the Dorra-esc in the film's back half, and I found them mostly distracting overall. The story is oddly paced and somehow overcomplicated while also being remarkable simple, so, unfortunately, the best way to watch Enola Holmes is with one's brain set to low - which isn't a great sign for a detective story.Nonetheless, Enola Holmes is two hours worth of lighthearted adventure that many people seem to have taken way, way too seriously. It is not a Sherlock Holmes story. It isn't even much of a mystery. It's a teen adventure film and should be treated as such. If that's what you're in the market for, Enola Holmes is worth the watch, being a good-quality example of the genre. If you're looking for a proper detective flick, I'd consider looking elsewhere.",Enola Holmes
1058,humbertoabb,Cheap knockoff,2,3 June 2021,"Great potential but ruined with the over use of breaking the fourth wall, over use of Enolas flashbacks to her childhood specially during the first fight scene.

1059,michaelphonic-41954,Great film that is quite enjoyable.,9,21 May 2021,"I felt compelled to write a review because so many of the negative reviews seem to have been written by men with iceberg-sized chips on their shoulders.I would like to point out to these immature oafs that making a movie with a feminist point of view is a GOOD thing, not a bad thing. If you think feminism in a movie is bad, then I suggest you stick to Stallone movies, as you are obviously not mature enough to understand that equality is good for everyone.I have also read three reviews who complained about the British accents of the lead actors, saying that they sounded too American. I can only say this: Millie Bobby Brown and Henry Cavill are both British, despite the fact that they have played Americans onscreen. Your obliviousness to reality is quite amusing.Anyway, enough with the naysayers. This is an excellent film, and Millie Bobby Brown shines in the lead role.

Men are depicted as despotic or weak or silly creatures, really? I completely misunderstood that secret women organization, what they fought for and what they gained? Idea of marriage is depicted as punishment, but how their relations with viscount should end up? Are there any other kinds of disguising other then to wear boys' clothes? So I want to hear the answer for question: what is the role of man in woman's life? And this film is trying to answer that his role can't be equal to her.

I looked it up and was pleasantly surprised to see that women, especially suffragettes, did learn jujitsu, (as it was seen to be more feminine than boxing!) main negative- I found the pacing a bit odd as I felt like they were trying to fit too much into one movie but the excellent acting by all the characters more than made up for that.

Instead of just showing us some strong female characters (and there are a lot of them in this movie, so that's great) it insists on constantly telling us that ""the world is changing"" and ""you can choose your own path in life"". These not-so-subtle messages are sometimes even narrated directly to the viewer by the main character.The old saying ""don't tell it, show it"" doesn't seem to be something the film makers have ever heard of.",Enola Holmes

I tried hard to like this movie but there were so many parts that made me cringe. Enola talking to the camera made it seem like Dora the Explorer. It definitely came off as a movie for young kids. Where it totally lost me was the scene where Enola was being drowned in a tub of water, she gave a cringey wink, then performed jujitsu on her attacker and ran and hid. And then, despite the fact that she was dripping wet, there was no trail of water leading to where she was hiding. She talks to the camera (more cringe. this was just such an awkward part of the film) while he is trying to find her in the background. Even though her hair was wet and much of her dress was soaked there is no trail of water droplets leading to where she was hiding. It was just too stupid.There were other really bad scenes but I won't bother going into them. Bad writing, bad directing, bad everything except for the actors themselves.The only thing good to come out of this is the fact that Louis Partridge is now in the public eye and will go on to have a fabulous career.

I believe that is feminism in media done right, and I'm glad movies like Enola Holmes, Wonderwoman, and others are made to show that the two messages of the film go hand in hand.This definitely isn't going to be nominated by the academy or win any crazy awards, and if you judge the movie strictly by the caliber of cast, this movie could definitely make a case for being underwhelming.All that being said, I felt pretty good watching the movie, it was a cute story, and I would definitely watch a sequel.",Enola Holmes

This is both good and bad. If you were expecting a mystery thriller, there wasn't much of one, and it certainly felt slow at times. This was more biographical in nature, as opposed to drawing you into a complex case. Enjoyable, but, admittedly I was hoping to truly solve a case with twists and turns with Enola. Millie Bobby Brown did an excellent job setting up the character - hopefully they follow it up with a series of her as an actual detective.",Enola Holmes
1108,fiona-hotton,Charming and enjoyable,9,29 September 2020,Watched this on impulse and have to say I found it thoroughly entertaining. I have read all the Sherlock Homes books in my youth and every incarnation has a different take in the characters. I'm not sure why some people have said that the characters are now true to form as there have been many different interpretations.The film made for an enjoyable break from reality and I would happily watch it and any further additions.,Enola Holmes

I would love to have this kind of relationship with my daughter soon. Also, not forgetting Enola's relationship with her uncle Sherlock, he is the example ,in my opinion, of how an uncle should be, so supportive, understanding, encouraging, and inspiring. So heartwarming this movie.",Enola Holmes
1113,ehd55,Wanted to give this a 7 but had to knock it down to a 6.,6,25 September 2020,"This is a film that could have a lot going for it, a great performance from a young lead actor( Millie Bobby Brown), Henry Cavill as Sherlock Holmes (which is i a thing i didn't know i wanted but am now glad that i have) and a nice aesthetic and build-up.
Sadly it tries really really sloppily to be a feminist flick ...
I usually love Sherlock Holmes movies because they, unlike most Hollywood movies, respect the audience and doesn't treat them as if they can't wrap their head around complex things or as if they will swallow any nonsense without an explanation. This movie is not that... but it very easily could have been, even while keeping it's light charm. This segways back to my point about the feminist component about the movie. About a third ways in the movie seems perfectly willing to sacrifice cleverness to really hammer home that 'This is a feminist movie guys!!', please believe me! It will go out of its way to explain the viewer what is happening, even though what is happening is simple enough for Any Teenager to understand. At the same time the movie expects us to ignore and forget for example (SPOILERS) that the assassin was blown to bits, and that Enola's mom was going to commit a terrorist act!
It is also another feminist movie with a strong independent female protagonist who falls in love with literally the first boy she meets for no real reason, Wonder Woman style.
The movie is busy telling me how strong, independent and intelligent Enola is, yet it constantly interrupts her when she is about SHOW it, which is something I'd much rather have.
A lesson id like for movies to learn is that, if a character is being; independent or strong or insert trait, people watching can see it! So when the movie goes out of its way to tell us, it takes AWAY from the character...Anyway, I'm gonna cut my rant short here. In short, I'm disappointed at the wasted potential here.
Thank you for coming to my Ted talk tm.",Enola Holmes
1114,EmmaKay,Lovely film,10,23 September 2020,"I thought it was a charming and a lovely film. It is not a documentary, it's a film. People seem to have forgotten that when reading other reviews. Just because it is set in a certain century does not mean that every detail has to be accurate to that time frame. That is the beauty of films. Nor does it have to have a political connotation to it simply because the lead is a young lady. It is just a film. One that is thoroughly enjoyable by anyone who is willing to watch it for what it is. It piggy backs of the names of other established ones such as S. Holmes and Mycroft and in doing so people expected them to be more of a presence in the film. However, the film is not about them. People believe that it makes S. Holmes more ""soft"" well, perhaps that is how his sister perceived him. Watch it for what it is, a lovely family friendly warm hearted well done film that anyone can enjoy if they choose to.",Enola Holmes
1115,sharpe-69738,Millie is great - the movie itself notsomuch.,4,28 September 2020,"Millie Bobby Brown is an amazing young actress with a bright future ahead of her. That said, this story is a mess and basically serves as a launch platform for Millie's career and little else.Towards the end it devolves into a plot-less hodge podge about something or other, then slams the viewer with a bunch of feminist talking points and then hides behind them, daring the viewer to criticise the cinematographic merits of the movie lest they be called out for being anti-feminist Conservative MAGA types.Well, I'm not buying it.Creating strong female leads is fine and dandy if you have a story that supports it organically - and that isn't new at all. Just look at Alien and others before and after it. Look at The Expanse TV show and even Millies' own Stranger Things. They all feature strong female leads, but the plots accommodate them naturally. Lately many movies seem to feel like the strong female lead has been shoehorned into the plot and that feels forced accordingly. In this case however, while the plot was written with a female lead in mind - the story itself was forced and all over the place and then it took a cheap political shot to try and hide that fact at the end.There were a few laughs though, to give it some credit - but little else.Basically it is aimed at young teenage girls.",Enola Holmes

MBB clearly owns this production and that is fine by me.. She breaks the 4th Wall and even THAT works for this plot.
Her mother goes missing which brings the elder brothers back to the family home. Immediately something is not right due to the family home being in such disarray .. Triangle story with Sherlock doing what Sherlock Does. The older Holmes being annoyed at everything and of course Enola being smarter and cuter than anyone else.

1121,weronikab,"Falls into the ""not like other girls"" trope",6,24 September 2020,"Now, where to begin?I can't pinpoint exactly where this movie lost me; the cinematography is quite beautiful, the music is fitting, the story seems simple enough for a more family-friendly Sherlock adventure.Our leading characters are all played by very talented actors; Millie Bobby Brown, Henry Cavill, and Sam Claflin. And yet, the acting seemed off to me. After a while I came to the conclusion that the dialogue was the reason; the conversations don't sound natural, and as a result the characters look like they're reciting lines, not acting. It took me out of whatever was happening several times; I never managed to actually see the characters instead of the actors.And of course... The feminism. I am a feminist myself. I can always appreciate a well-written female character, the thing is, though, that when a character is well written, you don't need to constantly point out the movie's feminist message.There were scenes that had me rolling my eyes, such as Enola explaining how a corset is ""oppressing"". She wouldn't know that in a time where every woman wore a corset; they could have conveyed the same message by showing her discomfort whilst wearing a corset.The character of Enola doesn't feel authentic - we're always told she's this or that; intelligent, kind, good hearted, wild, but rarely see it; she doesn't seem any more intelligent than any other sixteen year old girl, nor kinder, nor wilder. It's a classic example of telling instead of showing. What we get as a result is a character that keeps talking on and on about how she doesn't want to be this or that and ""like other ladies"", but we never get to see what she DOES want. Does she enjoy all the activities she was taught by her mother, or is it just that they're the only activities she knows of? Does she really want to be different than other girls or is it just something she's been taught to believe?There's nothing wrong with following your own path and I think it's an important lesson for young girls (and boys) to learn. However, the message the movie instead conveys is ""you should try to be different than everyone else"". In reality we're all different, and walk different paths, some more accepted by society and some less; Enola's path is one of the less accepted, but we don't really know why she wants to walk it, and as a result, the story feels empty.",Enola Holmes

1124,cshuvo,Utter waste of time,1,25 September 2020,"I am preety sure the director of this movie hasn't read a single Sherlock book or seen any of the screen interpretations. Watson's narrations describe Holmes as a very complex and moody character who, although of strict habit, is considerably untidy. His London abode at 221B, Baker Street, is tended by his housekeeper, Mrs. Hudson. Holmes appears to undergo constant episodes of mania and depression, the latter of which are accompanied by pipe smoking, violin playing, and cocaine use. This ain't no Sherlock, they could have named the movie Enola bond and it wouldn't have mattered any less.",Enola Holmes

That said, it may not be for diehard Sherlock Holmes fans who enjoy Doyle's style and characterization of Holmes. He's much kinder, empathetic and plays a protective big brother in the film - not in line with the original character. Enola breaks the fourth wall often and while that annoyed a lot of reviewers, it's when most of the comedy came through. I thought it was a cute addition and showed Enola's personality more.

Enola is very clever but never really gets to use it, ground so constantly as she is in bla scenes of heartfelt familial or romantic passion.In a way it's very 90s, especially in the overplayed themes of white women's empowerment, the threat of boarding school, and the trope of humiliating of a sneering old conservative codger man, in Mycroft.Henry Cavill also just looks ridiculously huge for his clothing.",Enola Holmes

As supporting Sam Claffin and Henry Cavill were great to watch- Sam does phenomenal- Henry- beautiful as ever- is just not the Sherlock Holmes type- he's too broad too macho his physical appearance deters he's ability to sell you on the fact that he's supposed to be a detective who keen senses and misses nothing.,Enola Holmes

I must respectfully say, as much as I respect your opinions, you've missed the point of the film entirely.Enola Holmes was not intended to be a masterpiece by Scorsese/Tarantino/James Cameron/Peter Jackson/Spielberg/Nolan et cetera et cetera and leave you with a powerful message or a million questions. This is supposed to be a fun family action/mystery for people of all ages to enjoy, with a hint of that familiar character that is the iconic detective of Baker Street. The film succeeded in its aims to be fun, a film to watch with others to unwind after a long day and forget about life. This film, along with a great story and stellar cast led by the always spectacular Miss Millie Bobby Brown, is exactly what this world needs at this moment in time.The aforementioned cast did brilliantly in their roles. MiIlie Bobby Brown pulls the character off excellently, managing to be a perfect blend of Sherlock and a regular teenage girl, creating a fantastic original character. Cavill and Claflin were exceedingly good (and at some points rather humorous) in their roles of the Holmes brothers and Helena Bonham Carter brings her usual brilliance to the table in her role. The film itself is fantastic, managing to entertain whilst working in the underlying subplot and message of women's rights.I'd highly suggest watching this film and if my argument hasn't persuaded you, let me ask you this; why do we go to the cinema but to be entertained?",Enola Holmes
1137,nessa_boo,Very enjoyable!,10,23 September 2020,I thought this movie was a real delight. Millie is so charismatic and it was so fun seeing her in this role and seeing her break the fourth wall.

From the very start Millie Bobby Brown is completely engaging and shows off her amazing acting talent.The movie could have possibly had more puzzles, twists and turns, as the delivery of them were very entertaining.Great movie!!On a side note, there was a strong feminist underlining throughout the movie which was delivered through comedy, adding to the films charm. I believe Millie Bobby Brown is next to do a project surrounding LGBTQ. As strongly as I support both equalities, I hope she doesn't focus her career only on political roles and storylines.I really look forward to seeing her morph in to varied roles and grow toward the big blockbusters!",Enola Holmes
1144,chloesuzette,It Could've Been Great if it Wasn't This,3,24 September 2020,"Before anyone attacks me for not being feminist or caring too much about historical accuracy: couldn't care less about those themes in the film. Rather, more that the actors really don't care about their characters (except maybe Brown but she's not convincing in her role), the multiple plotlines they come up with are dull, factors of the plot are never really explained so you don't know if you should feel emotionally invested or not, and the film itself seems to try drag you into an intriguing mystery when all it has is a boring little puzzle with an even more boring and disappointing conclusion.There was so much this movie could do but didn't, or couldn't for whatever reason. The editing is bad (particularly the continuity stuff which is thrown around willy nilly), the 4th wall breaks feel like lazy ways of throwing in exposition and honestly get quite irritating, and overall it just wasn't that interesting. The concept of the Holmes sister can be so widely played with, but sticking her into a trope of ""trying to be herself but also trying to be like Sherlock"" is predictable and just doesn't really work. This character could be so many things but it truly felt like watching a watered down Sherlock mystery you would find in something like Sherlock Gnomes, i.e for children.

1155,vivekbha,A tint of feminism in Victorian-era London,6,24 September 2020,"GENERAL OVERVIEW:In the footsteps of her elder brother Sherlock, Enola Holmes finds herself as a slueth/decipherer in finding her runaway mother - who wants to make the world a safe place for her daughter to live in - and not be dictated by the Victorian style of bounded feminity.DIRECTION & CINEMATOGRAPHY:Being the most vibrant color-coded film of the year, Mr. Nuttigen makes an impressive camera use and lighting techniques to highlight the dosage of free and independent young girl, trying to gain freedom from the clutches of a ""proper British lady"". Mr. Bradbeer knows his vision to bring his heroine to Baker Street and turn her a franchise star. We'll have to wait for what he has to offer us in the future with a Heroine we are growing fond of.ACTING:Millie takes home a charm of her own, by bringing Enola from the books to the screen for her visceral teen beauty for people to fall in love with. Her wit and charm is constantly triggered by her free will and constraint borders, which serve as fresh air in the Holmes universe. Mr. Cavill is a poignant slueth, Sherlock, except I would still give Benedict proving a better Sherlock ( A Debate? )
Helena Bonham Carter is always graceful, one of the finest, most refined actors in the industry.FINAL CALL:This fresh take on the female-centric Holmes is nothing less than fun, entertaining and visceral future franchise that would bloom by our Enola presenting gracefully a star of her own production, who has a bright future to interact. The story telling is exponentially low than the Guy Ritchie franchise (who is a wonderful filmmmaker, himself) and hence we get his inspiration in the quick cuts and sliding zoom-pan play which he stylized.

I initially didn't realize that this film is based on a book series by Nancy Springer. I just saw it on Netflix and couldn't get past the first ten minutes. The way Sherlock and Mycroft are portrayed is just too irritating. It feels like the creators have no sense of the characters.But I loved the concept of an Ebola Holmes so I was happy to find out it was a book series. I read the first one so far and it's lots of fun. I especially love how Springer dives into the day-to-day lives of women in a way that most Sherlock-focused stories would not.So then I came back to try this movie again thinking maybe it's not too bad.

Some jujitsu battles and old-timey fisticuffs, as well as a fun scene with fireworks/explosives, and the baddie does die in the end, but it's more or less an accident. No language, nudity, sex, and even Sherlock is stone cold sober. I'd rate it PG for age 9-10+ and a must watch family film! (Unless you or your kiddo are ultra sensitive to violence, and I mean ultra.)",Enola Holmes

1169,karucci,An entertaining watch!,8,24 September 2020,"While I agree that it could have had a little more mystery and a more satisfying end to Eudoria's arc, the film overall is very entertaining with some brilliant performances. Millie Bobby Brown, in her character of Enola Holmes, is understated and real without some of the exaggerated theatrics usually associated with the Sherlock Holmes franchise. All in all, definitely worth a watch!!",Enola Holmes
1170,MoomsieMoo,Disappointing,3,27 September 2020,Plot was not interesting in any way. Breaking the third wall also made the film painfully awkward to watch. Ending was terrible and the whole film normalised parental abandonment.,Enola Holmes
1171,agarhritikwal,Banking on the holmes name and the hype it creates,3,24 September 2020,Basically it would have been a good movie had it been enola but making it enola holmes created a lot of expectations which were not met as the reputation of the holmes name generally comes with a spectacular mind boggling story which was missing this was a good story but couldn't live up to the name,Enola Holmes

The 4th wall breaks were weird and made me feel like I was Dora The Explorer at some points. The best part of the film was the acting, but everything was fine. I will probably never see this film again.
Edit: I just found out that the same director of photography was the same man who did the director of photography for Hell or High Water. I am so confused you did an amazing job in that film but you gave the most boring work on this film. WHAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTT?",Enola Holmes
1175,willbentley,Fairly harmless,5,23 September 2020,"The Holmes name does tend to carry an expectation of the film being centred around a complicated, developed mystery, however this is not the case on this occasion. This doesn't make it necessarily bad, but does leave a void at the heart of the film that it tries to fill with kwirky tone, but I imagine the execution of which falls short of what the makers would have wished.As stated its a fairly harmless, easy to follow, plot that doesn't really provoke any emotions but could be watched as a fun family film.",Enola Holmes
1176,drummindude-76375,Outstanding!,9,29 September 2020,"Netflix has come along way, this is a great movie full of adventure, twists, and suspense! Love the 1880 England depiction, Ellie is simply amazing!",Enola Holmes
1177,philgaeng,dispointing,5,14 October 2020,"Sherlock Holmes has a mother, a strong woman with her own views about everything.
Sherlock Holmes has a younger sister, Enola, who we learn quickly is just as smart and odd as he is.
The mother vanishes and leaves her daughter to the ward of Sherlock and brother Mycroft.
Enola escapes her brothers and start to look for her mother.
Sherlock is set to find them both.What a great situation for a movie.One expects puzzles, discovering new characters and new traits in characters we already know.
We do not get any of that and it is extremely disappointing.As a 40 years old, I was ready to watch a genZ movie. I can deal with the instafilter photography, super close ups, and maybe with the fact that the hero is a super hero with no flaws what so ever.
BUT I AM EXPECTING A STORY.Many reviewers explain that this movie is intended to teens. That us, grown ups, we are not fair to the movie because we are not able to dream anymore.
When I was a teenager, I read Jules Vernes, Alexandre Dumas, les Miserables or David Copperfield.
Characters were characters, there were vilains and adventures. The plots were sometimes highly unrealistics, and so were the turns but they were set in a way that a reader will just stick to them. Emilia Holmes starts with a wonderful plot and just wastes it.Maybe I respect teenagers and the audience more than most of the reviewers. Movies are not about entertaining. Movies tell stories. Entertaining may be a quality of the movie, not its only aim.Hire real writers to work with a material of this quality.
Acknowledge that teenagers and even children can deal with great characters and create dimensions to your characters. We all want to see how the misanthrope Sherlock Holmes will deal with his sister. We are all excited to see how she will interact with Dr Watson. And we want to know what the mother is after.Are we believing that our teens of today cannot live up to that standard? That they should be satisfy with a lazy writing that doesn't build any drama?
I don't think so.",Enola Holmes

The acting is decent, the director's work appeals to the audience, with background and details filling the main action scenes.
The downside is the plotline to a certain extent and the conclusion of the events of the movie, easily predicted, however, it could be a good tale for the young people looking for the ways to lay their own path in life.",Enola Holmes

The lead is a ""16"" year old girl that is smart, brave, doubtful, determined and uncertain all at the same time, it seems. My family, including two teen boys, truly hopes there are more films and that there is a series! More Enola Holmes!",Enola Holmes
1189,momad-04510,I hate Millie Bobby Brown,6,23 September 2020,"I watched alot of Millie interviews
And that made her acting very bad
Her personality rebounded on her acting",Enola Holmes
1190,sbshubhambodh,The movie was ok for timepass,7,24 September 2020,"The movie was ok for timepass .I basically watched it for some Sherlock scenes.
The movie depicts Mycroft in a bad way.
Those who know Mycroft know that he is much more deductive than Sherlock but doesn't take part in cases cause he doesn't want to go to sits to look for clues.The movie was easily predictible",Enola Holmes
1191,thedailycinegraph,Surprisingly good,6,26 September 2020,"'Enola Holmes' is a movie about a teenage girl, a young sister of the famous detective, Sherlock Holmes, and his no less well-known brother, Mycroft. She lived with her mother in a typical British province where both of them lived a life of the dream. They played tennis in a living room, learnt subjects that were atypical for the young lady of those times. There was the whole for each other, and their company was enough for a happy life. However, the week before Enola turned 16, her mother disappeared. So, despite the wish of her brother to send her for the young lady school, the main character decided not only to find her mother but to take responsibility for her own life.To be honest, I started to watch it with scepticism. 'Well, it would be nice to watch the picturesque nature of Britain, see the well-known actors and that's it'. You can't imagine my surprise when I caught myself carefully watching the film. I couldn't take my eyes from all the details - lightness of plot developing, brilliant acting, highly circumspect plot. I can't say that the movie is outstanding, it actually shouldn't be like that. We should remember that it' an adaptation of book series for teens.Bu the way, this fact influenced the movie significantly. Several topics were mentioned in the movie that are still difficult to discuss even for adults. They are feminism. generation gap, the influence and pressure from family members and society, the inevitability of circumstances, the issues of raising children. But it popped up so easily, without any judgment. Just like ""issues to consider in future"".On a separate point, I would like to mention the acting both of movie giants (Helena Bonham Carter, Fiona Shaw, Frances de la Tour, Henry Cavill, Sam Claflin) and young beginners (Millie Bobby Brown and Louis Patridge). They had no even a sec of falsity or histrionics, only high0level acting that draws the audience attention.To sum up, it's a witty, light and kind movie for you to watch with your closest and dearest",Enola Holmes
1192,isaiahf-45917,Didn't expect this,10,27 October 2020,"So, when I went on Netflix to watch it, I had no idea what to expect. They just chose the right actors for this movie. Henry Cavill was a perfect Sherlock Holmes, and Millie Bobby Brown was the best choice because she's British, which fit the roll of the movie. She was also really amazing in her roll in Stranger Things, she is also my #1 favorite actor. My top 3 favorite actors are: #1 Millie Bobby Brown, #2 Hugh Jackman, and #3 would be Craig Fairbass, who voiced my #1 favorite Call of Duty character of all time, Simon ""Ghost'' Riley. To sum this up, I give this movie 110% rating, overexceted my expectation from the movie, totally recommend it, and is now my #1 favorite movie of all time, overexceding Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt. 2 and Stranger Things.",Enola Holmes
1193,boishakhi-65924,Not upto the expectations,6,25 September 2020,"The amount of hype was created by this movie, Isn't fulfilled even a bit. First of all the storyline is average,they had a great start but then seemed like the flow was lost and they kind of rushed into a new motive, did not explain anything well.
Now cast, Henry Cavill wasn't a good choice for Sherlock, his accent Isn't convincing as sherlock at all, though his acting is great as alway. But this man was born british still can't do a proper british accent. Millie Bobby Brown poured some overacting and unnecessary body language. The actor who played Mycroft portrayed the character quite accurately, i am only satisfied by his acting.
Overall, an average movie for teens, but adults will be disappointed a lot.",Enola Holmes
1194,manveshgill,A new approach to our favorite characters,6,24 September 2020,"I know this movie revolves around enola holmes and it has quite some witty scenes,breaking thr fourth wall was unique but if you are a strong reader of Sherlock books you will notice quite the difference in our favorite characters Sherlock and mycroft both but knowing that movie focuses on enola we can keep that aside but still from my perspective movie had a lot of untapped potential and could have done better with portraying the characters.",Enola Holmes
1195,jacobdb-68213,Good Movie.,9,23 September 2020,I loved the mystery behind the movie. It has a very gripping story. I suggest to those who have free time,Enola Holmes

Besides the eye candy that was the set design, (to say nothing of the actors!), it was a joy to watch such a fresh way to tell the story. Having all the breaking of the fourth wall was risky, and I believe no one other than Millie Bobby Brown could have done it.",Enola Holmes
1198,diegozil-82356,Extremely interesting,7,28 September 2020,"Millie Bobby Brown is very good breaking the fourth wall. The history is good and interesting, all the clues that she's finding.

1199,oleanderoad,"Fantastic, interesting & Quirky movie... a refreshing change.",9,26 September 2020,"Millie Bobby Brown excels in the role of Enola Holmes, stellar performance from this young Actress. I first saw her in Stranger Things, which was a really excellent Sci-Fi series and Millie has gone from strength to strength.
Also, a cute different role for Henry Cavill (aka. Superman), nice to see him in something different, a quirky and humorous role for him.
Alway's love to see the bohemian, Helena Botham-Carter, perfect casting her as the mother.
All in all, something different, witty & charming, as I said, a refreshing change. Hopefully, we will see a sequel to this movie, it lends itself well to follow on movie.",Enola Holmes

1202,rivwyhra,Was Ok not enough Henry Cavill,6,23 September 2020,The movies was ok! Millie did a good Job but the 4th breaking wall of the time was a bit annoying! The ending was a little stupid in my opinion. I did enjoy Henry as Sherlock a Wish they gave him more to do as Sam too.,Enola Holmes
1203,illopis,Irrelevant romantic interest,2,27 September 2020,Not only I think Henry Cavill is one of the worst Sherlocks ever (maybe Benedict Cumberbatch has raised the bar so high) but what is the point in creating a very smart and intelligent female lead role to then have her lose her pants for a decaf boy with long hair? So she starts looking for her mum and falls in love with the first boy she encounters? Obviously it was written by a man. Fell asleep half way through and I still consider it a waste of time.,Enola Holmes
1204,wwbuffydo,"As usual, read the books instead",2,24 September 2020,"In the books, Enola is a bit younger, her relationship with her mother is more complicated, and she is truly alone. The books are more historically accurate, and she is much more clever. Enola faces some true challenges as she is learning to navigate on her own and values the freedom her mother has procured for her. She eludes her brother Sherlock and does not have a boyfriend. So sad that they compromised and dumbed down the movie.",Enola Holmes

It's a stunning, beautiful movie for those forgotten women in the last century. It's not just a feminist movie, it's a statement of intents of what our mission as young people is: stand up for equality, human rights and commemorate the good ones in the past. Also, a very good adventure movie to watch in family .",Enola Holmes
1206,IQuacke,"Great Ideas, Bad Execution",6,24 September 2020,"An enjoyable film, great to watch with your family.
But, I am far too disappointed in what this movie could have been. You have great actors, simple, but great storyline and many motives this film wanted to portray to its audience. I quite can't find exactly what went wrong there, but I may have a few things in my mind. First off, I didn't like how they ''tried'' to put as many topics and messages into this one amalgam of mess. Actors did a decent job, I loved the performances of all actors, especially Millie, who I think really put her soul into this.
So, we had an unnecessary love scene, which had no reason to be there whatsoever, then this film became too feministic for me, but I didn't mind it at all actually, but then I remembered I was too focused on Enola finding her mother, but during the film I feel like it wasn't really focused on that, rather they tried to show the feminism and their other unnecessary thoughts. The ending was very disappointing for me.
Music fit, but didn't really stand out to me. I don't know what to think of the clothes, they fit into the era, but I just simply didn't like the choices for the outfits, personally.
Also, was it just me or the lighting was a bit off. Anyways, nice movie, but it's not a must watch.",Enola Holmes
1207,daivikgoyal,"If you are a sherlock fan, you will be disappointed for sure ....",5,30 September 2020,"This movie is not for Sherlock fans, it is just a light funny drama movie with no great suspense or mind bend story ( as one would expect from a holmes movie ).
The worst part of the movie is Millie bobby brown talking to the camera after every 15 minutes, it just so annoying, Millie bobby brown talking to camera in a periodic movie kills the narrative of the movie. Talking to the audience makes sense in Deadpool becuase it is a funny movie, not a periodic drama based on someone's life.",Enola Holmes

1219,ericericson-89119,Just not bad.,6,23 September 2020,"Millie gives a charming performance in an otherwise lacking film. The production often feels cheap, dialogue feels forced at times, and there is something to be said about the race of certain characters, though only when it comes to their status, given that the film is set in the 1890's.As said, Millie I think does great as Enola. She's charming, witty, and has a certain physicality in the role that was refreshing. Henry Cavill broods as a gentler Sherlock Holmes than previous iterations, but his size makes it hard to see anything but superman playing dress-up, and I say this as a fan. Sam Claflin is good as the eccentric Mycroft, though he has less of a presence in the film than one might think.The story starts off interesting, with the disappearance of Helena Bonham Carter's Mrs. Holmes, only leaving hidden messages for Enola, who promptly goes after her, with Sherlock reluctantly doing the same. This could have been an interesting story on its own, but a good chunk of the film spends time with a certain boy on a train, which was uninteresting and really slowed the film down.The focus should have been on Enola and her place in this quite legendary family an the world as a woman. And when it does so it does so well.It was a fun film despite its faults, that I would definitely have my daughters watch when/if I have them.",Enola Holmes
1220,summertrianglestars,Y'all Need to Chill,8,23 September 2020,"This is a fictional story about Enola Holmes--not Sherlock Holmes. The name ""Sherlock"" is more of a setting/narrative device than a relevant character. We should expand our perception of how an intelligent person behaves, speaks, and looks. Being unfeeling, being a sociopath, and being hooked on cocaine, should not be (and certainly isn't the case in the real world) identifiers for a genius person.
Normally, I don't like films that hit you over the head with the feminist message--because it normally isn't done well. This time it's part of the character, it's a developed concept, and it's a developed narrative. Relax. No reason to get heated. Just enjoy it. A solid Netflix release.

This film is fun. It has a fantastic cast who are on their A game. It has a good and understandable plot line with plenty of action and twists to keep the average (none of us are experts so stop pretending to be) but intelligent viewer hooked to the end.Films are fun.

This movie show the story of a real girl, into a real world, where the only thing she has is her confidence and bravery. Enola Holmes is perfect set and cinematography perfect, with very beautiful scenes and really interesting storyline.
The comedy and drama is missed and built together with mystery , showing how a women, in the late 1800, had to be prepared to have an v small chance on society.
Honestly one of the movies that more impacted me ever, Millie Bobby Brown actuation is just on point to drag your attention to the show, she stoles the movie with her charismatic personality and realistic spirit. The break of the forth wall is done so flawlessly, no excess or too less, with some iconic moments such as the one she blinked under the water.

I don't care about the facts of history. Life is brutal enough and I do not want to be reminded of the monstrosities of it.
The scenery was beautiful and breathtaking. The cast and actors wonderful. Millie Bobby Brown was an absolute delight to watch. Refreshing acting. I loved the entire movie!! Had me laughing and giggling and crying. This is EXACTLY what the world needs right now.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if they could make a TV series with Enola's Adventures?!
For people with real adventure and wonder in their hearts... this movie is a must to watch!",Enola Holmes
1231,thestudent-45214,Great movie!,10,23 September 2020,"I feel like all the other reviews are reviewing this film on something it isn't trying to be. So if you want a historically accurate film or if you want a non female empowerment film then don't watch it. It is NOT historically accurate and it does EMPOWER women. I am reviewing this film on the entertainment it gave me.This film is a very nice, charming, family friendly film. It is very light hearted and not too serious.The film has just the right amount of female empowerment so you can see the message shown whilst not ruining the plot of the film.Lastly I believe it is remarkable that Millie Bobby Brown was able to produce and star in this film at a very young age.",Enola Holmes

The story was interesting and kept you engaged without force. Millie was fantastic and added a comedic timing through frequently breaking of the fourth wall.I find it funny that the main critiques have been that this film is too focused on a feminist movement. I find that ironic as those reviews primarily seem to be from male critiques. Whilst there are historical inaccuracies, this is also a fictional story and shouldn't be seen as a historical piece of fact",Enola Holmes
1233,rhayamitchell,Very good.,10,23 September 2020,A lot of people don't like it because they don't support feminist groups. MISOGYNY at its finest. Not much of a mystery because they wouldn't have given Enola a big first one to discover. Also in the 19th century you weren't thrown into a mental hospital 24/7. They sent her away like normal.

This movie is all about a young girl, who is becoming a woman, with a different mindset than those in her society. She didn't want to be told how to act, who to be, or what to wear. It may have been a little more off from how history was for women at that time but it doesn't take away from the actual purpose or message of the movie.

1236,qnng-01375,"Undercooked. Good concept, really really bad execution.",4,24 September 2020,"The movie length was too short when it tried to cover lots of things. Leaving the story felt really rushing.
Like many other detective movies, it set up a hunting-treasure puzzle but everything went too fast. It didn't show much of the characters or the story plot, it's more like a summary.When what happened to Enola's mother, it only took around 25mintues after that for Enola to solve the puzzle that her mom left behind and went on her adventure, and how she's able to figure out everything so fast. In my opinion, the movie rushed through the storyline of her mother while trying to cover Enola character with a short amount of time so it felt like something is missing. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate female protagonist, this one just felt undercooked. I would say it'd be better if the movie length was around 3-4 hours or make it into a series.The views in the movie were really fascinating but I wish they didn't put too much color contrast. Otherwise, the characters' designs and atmosphere lived up to its standard. For the characters' lines, some of them felt like they were written by some college students who first took theatre class :/Overall, good concept and intention, but bad execution and move length too short.",Enola Holmes

1241,jojarstark,"Lazy Writing, with just ""ok"" production.",1,19 June 2021,"1. Why the name Holmes if you not going to do anything with it. Holmes is smart at deduction, solve a very hard mystery. This girl barely use deductions or foresee anything, and the mystery is kinda solve itself.2. As I said, mystery solve itself. It's too easy and not very interesting. Also, it wasn't allowed the audience to solve it as there is no foreshadowing or even info dumb.3. The story did not establish the main character's competence early in the movie. Instead, it choose to reveal her abilities right just before the scene where she need to use each of them. This is lazy writing. It slowly distroyed the suspense as the audience watching and starting to feel that something in her past will always jump out and help her get away.4. People talk about how it's not fair for weman. Weman complained. BUT WE BARELY SEES IT HAPPENING. It would have been better if we get more scene like how Mycroft interacts with his sister, and how weman were being oppressed by the society. SHOW DON'T TELL PLEASE.5. Holmes have there mind as a weapons. This girl protagonist mostly rely on her physical. She can't foresee the danger, she can't talk her way out of it too. She only run or jump or fight. It would have been cooler to show that even if she is a girl and not as strong as most men, she still have the sharpest mind and be on top of the situation. But no, in this movie, she is the stupidest Holmes.This is just a movie about a girl with a terrerist mom who is going to slove political issues, not with her wisdom and patience, but with violence. The girl felt in love with a stupid boy she just met and try to help him do something stupid by being stupid.",Enola Holmes
1242,jostewart-46695,Did exactly what it said out to do and did it well,8,24 September 2020,"A lot of the people on IMDB went into this movie expecting or hoping for another dark, gritty Sherlock Holmes movie with a dark twist and assaulting realities about the truth of the human condition. These people missed the point of the movie.It was about a sixteen year old, intelligent and empowered young girl developing out of her sheltered life. There was many complex characters, including the men. Many of the men in the movie represented the general perception of women in the day, whereas other men showed a different perspective. It didn't feel aggressively feminist because the suffragette movement was the underlying notion of the movie- it fit perfectly. The characters were fun and the way Enola interacted with the audience and the cameras was a great convention that not many movies use.There is, of course, down sides to every film, as is the nature of subjective art. For instance, it was very historically inaccurate in some aspects such as the position and treatment of POC, but 1) the movie was about progressing and changing the world and so they needed to include people who are a part of the revolution and 2) if they didn't include any POC they would be getting backlash for it. I enjoyed the story and the inclusion of POC but still knew that wasn't the reality of the times. It's a fictional movie.Overall, I watched it while completing some writing and I found myself drawn to the movie more than my writing. The acting was excellent, the story line was good for their target audience and the A-list cast were done justice. I'd personally love to see them turn it into a series of her solving and deciphering problems.",Enola Holmes
1243,sumaikafish,It wasn't that good.,4,24 September 2020,"I watched this thinking that I'd have a good plot but it didn't live up to my expectations at all. I mean I understand that they wanted a ""female character in power"" but in that process they totally flattened Sherlock's and Mycroft's personalities. The plot was a bit off cause we spend the first half of the movie thinking that we are looking for the mother but then Boom no we will look for the boy. And then the mother comes out of nowhere. It didn't live up to my expectations and destroyed Sherlock's and Mycroft's character and there was no jhon. 😬 The movie could have been made without specifying that enola was related to Sherlock they could've created a new background for her.",Enola Holmes

1246,mvrgia,Don't let them fool you.,9,24 September 2020,"All these misogynistic reviewers claiming historical accuracy are clearly the only uneducated ones, all women jiu-jitsu and boxing classes became popular in the early 1900, while women fought for their political empowerment they associated it with bodily empowerment. Clearly the movie is not meant to be 100% historically accurate, movies rarely are, and it is meant to show that period of time in a more lighthearted way than we're generally used to, obviously women had to struggle a lot more and they had to endure way worse than what we're shown in the movie but that is because the social fight isn't meant to be the centre of the plot. The main point of the plot is still the mystery, first her mother's disappearance mystery then the mystery around the marquis attemped murder, which are both strictly linked to the historical context. I'd say the movie's setting would be around 1918, when in the UK the male electorate was extended to include all men over 21. I genuinely enjoyed the movie, finally a 16 years old character interpreted by an actual 16 years old actress, it is a playful and somehow comedic way to introduce the social issues of the time to a larger audience, usually movies that revolve around social injustice fights (especially women's rights) are meant for an older audience, but in this case we have a badass heroine in a PG-13 movie that still tackles interesting social fights.

I know that the attack on the main character Enola is different, however it seems like the plot and story telling is poorly written. I expected exciting plots in which I wouldn't have seen coming, however as the story progress, they just keep on throwing details that aren't very much useful towards the end. Based on the trailer it should have been Enola's search for herself and her mother, but sadly you wouldn't get to be excited about it.The love story for me is irrelevant.Good casting though.
Also, this is so Netflix-y. You can feel how they're trying to please targeted viewers by adding plots that doesn't make sense towards the story.Giving this a generous 4/10.",Enola Holmes

""I thought ""Enola Holmes"" was fab - a hugely entertaining film.Cavill is good but his role is quite short. I wish Sherlock and Enola had more screen time together. To be able to potray these family like emotions so persuasively was amazing.

Beautifully made, I think I've never seen a period piece use so much vibrance and colour before. It's like people forget how gaudy old England designs really were.Millie Bobby Brown truly knows how to work a lead like this. Now with Enola Holmes, it turns out she's got quite the knack for cinema production too. What a bright young lady, her future looks extremely incredible and I, for one, can't wait to witness it.And yes. Henry Cavill as Holmes? *chef's kiss.*Notable mentions: Helena Bonham Carter as the One and Only Mama Holmes, Sam Claflin as a wonderfully DESPICABLE Mycroft, and honestly the entire cast.

1265,endercattm,It was okay,4,26 September 2020,"First of all, can people please stop being so condescending to people who don't like this movie? Everyone has their own tastes, maybe it has nothing to do with the feminist message (I'm not saying people won't dislike it for said message, but not everyone is like that). Same goes for people who are against it because of the message: it was fine, but there were still issues.It was a cutsey little movie, I guess. The characters were bland, except for Enola. The fourth wall breaks were not something I enjoyed a lot: in fact, I found it unnerving, but that's just me. Maybe inner dialogue would've been better. I guess if the book is in first person, it's hard to translate it onto the screen.
And arriving at the message: it could've been better done. It was good sometimes while most of the time it was forced and cringy. Comments like ""useless boy"" and ""useless men"" made me uncomfortable, as the goal is not the belittle men but to uplift women. It drives a point that women don't need no man but it could've been done better. I do think that it's important to teach girls that they should make their own decisions and that no one, not even their own family, should decide for them. That they can do whatever they want and they should be allowed to. But the way Hollywood goes about it isn't very nuanced or good at all: making overpowered, perfect characters that just so happen to be female, therefore girls should ""relate"" to them is absurd.Also, are we not going to talk about how the mother and that one token black lady were going to commit terrorism? And no one touched on it or said ""terrorism bad""? The mom recognized it was bad so why wasn't it spoken more clearly?
Lastly, the ""love interest"" and Enola had no chemistry whatsoever. It felt very forced, probably because it was like they barely knew each other. They had 4-5 encounters total in the movie and you suspect me to think they like each other? Maybe it's the actors, I dunno, but no chemistry.Overall, it was okay and enjoyable but too long and wasn't that great in the end. I won't be watching it again. The plot twist, however, was very well done.",Enola Holmes
1266,amandadaley-27509,Loved it! Great for families with girls.,9,26 September 2020,"My little girl is only 8. There is some violence and scary parts, but she loved it. She laughed and cried and was absolutely captivated the whole time. She brought the movie up the next night at dinner because it'd been on her mind all day.I think this movie is good for girls of all ages. It is especially good for Moms and daughters. It is also good for men such as my husband because it is entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable,I'm disappointed with the 1/10 ratings by some men below. No, the writers do not need a history lesson. They were not oblivious to the constraints on women at the time. Actually, the attempt to tame and control Enola is quite central to the story. Yes, the movie does put modern day values onto a bygone era, but it is not historically inaccurate that some women of that time were radical and brilliant and willing to risk it all! The women of the suffrage movement were very brave and there have always been women doing amazing things, albeit sometimes they had to pretend to be men, as Enola does. Like others have said, this movie is not supposed to be a serious historical drama. It is meant to be lighthearted.I loved the mother daughter relationship. I loved their closeness. In the age of home learning because of COVID I bet a lot of parents could relate to this movie because the movie starts with scenes of intense home schooling. In our home, home learning was tough and there were long days when sometimes tears were shed. I've now also tried to teach her piano and guitar and we've been doing science experiments - making sun dials, thinking about density and forces and light. I've taught long division and fractions and I've made her do tasks repeatedly until she understood. It hasn't been easy for us. When watching this movie there are physical fight scenes between Mom and daughter which are the jiu jitsu lessons So, I asked my daughter, do you know why they're fighting? And she replied, because she wants her to learn. And, I said to her ""Now you understand me"" and in response I got the warmest snuggles on the couch. So, for us this movie helped bring a little healing, and it was fun to bond with my daughter over it.",Enola Holmes

For me the whole movie doesn't make sense. Firstly I hater the villans because they are too classic..in every other netflix movie you will found the exact same type of villans. Also what I didnt like is that ""grandmother"" is the biggest villan, I think the writers could've thinked for some better ending, and not just that some granny suddenly want to kill her grandson..Idk it just doesnt make sense to me. I also would like to add that I think the whole movie is just too complicated.But, I really dont want people to hate much on thus movie because it is fun to kids that are into crime movies, that dont have innapropriet or disturbing scenes.After all I would give this movie a solid 6/10.Thanks for reading my review!",Enola Holmes

And in what alternate universe does Mycroft ask Sherlock about deduction? Anyone who has read Sir Doyle's books knows that Mycroft is way better than Sherlock at deduction but he's just lazy and hence leaves all footwork to Sherlock.
Enola doesn't use even 1% of brain, and the only deduction she makes is wrong. How's this a detective story if there's no investigation or deductions made? Also, the director thinks that Enola staring into the camera and breaking 4th wall is something brilliant and he just invented that. It's so overused in the movie.
I watched it just because I'm an avid Sherlock fan and have watched and read all of his books. This was painful to watch, I would rather watch my accountant do taxes for 2 hours than watch this ""movie""",Enola Holmes
1283,s-35894,Good. But Could've been great.,2,28 September 2020,"I really enjoyed the concept of this movie and the script! I just wish it was executed slightly different. The way Enola was portrayed was fine, but if she was just slightly sassier and tough (more veronica mars Esque) I feel like it would've elevated the film a lot more. Enola Holmes is a great role model, but I feel as if she doesn't quite meet that bar where girls would want to be her. There are so many cool lines that would have been even spicier is she was played differently. Millie Bobby Brown doesn't sell the role for me, I genuinely feel like I was watching her say lines. The breaking of the fourth wall was a cool idea, but I feel like it was very much overdone in the film, if it was slightly more subtle and less often I feel like it would've had that immersive effect that was trying to be achieved. For me, the breaking of the fourth wall so excessive to the point where it took me out of the film. Although having a very well known cast is what pulled the initial audience in, I feel as though at least casting Enola as someone unknown would've sold the period piece. Obviously, my opinion doesn't matter in the slightest, but I was disappointed. I was really excited for this movie, but I didn't feel convinced the whole time. There was just something missing. A spark perhaps. Considering that, a lot of people have different opinions than mine, which means it must have an appeal that I'm missing.",Enola Holmes
1284,darialiseenko,"Dash, costumes & ambience ok",2,28 September 2020,"Women empowerment is a good and popular topic, but this movie completely misses the point.
Mom of the main character is basically a terrorist, and her boyfriend´s grandma tries to kill him, doesn´t succeed only because of some movie luck, and isn´t even said to be punished for this.
Enola misbehaves all the time, even when the rules have nothing to do with gender (like don´t throw food at others, don´t slurp, don´t steal someone´s car...).
All of this is made to seem normal, even heroic actions.
Enola´s runaway mother doesn´t have the decency of explaining herself in the end of the film. She disappeared on her daughter´s birthday, leaving some clues that led nowhere.
Wouldn´t want my children to watch this. It is not about empowerment, but bad manners and total lack of respect to others.
Costumes and filming deserve recognition though. So does the tiny pine cone doggy :)",Enola Holmes

As stated in other reviews, it was charming, clever, funny, & well acted, with some good drama and quizzical whimsy -- keeping you guessing on where it will go. Also great underlying themes/messages about equal rights and self-empowerment to boot (which are very topically relevant today). I also thought Millie Bobby Brown did an awesome job as the lead character.I hope Netflix plans to make movies of the additional books in the near future. I'm ready to watch them!",Enola Holmes
1287,viraltaco_news,It's above average. It fails in in many ways.,7,29 September 2020,"TL;DR: Overall good. Ideal for movie night with the kids. Not, as far as I'm aware, cannon.First of all, the setting: the Victorian era. I love period pieces that take place in the 19th century. Apart for a few small period inaccurate dialogue, it's pretty good.It's not canon. Not the least bit. It takes a lot of liberties but all of them exist only to drive the plot forward. The only real connection the is to Sherlock Holmes is the one portrayed in the movie itself.Cinematographic, was I to review that in a vacuum, it shows no evident flaw. It's far from the best I've seen but not as far as it it from average.
The camera work, acting, and pretty much all of the artistic direction is simply as good as it gets.Finally, I want my wall back. I like having 4 of them. I can see how it may make the movie more approachable to the younger audience.My score is a 67/90, half a point short of 8/10.",Enola Holmes

1290,essiemew,Certainly had fun!,7,30 September 2020,"I'm writing this review solely out of spite. I am a massive fan of all the people calling ""PC culture!"" and ""historical inaccuracy!"", for with a quick google of ""womens self defense history"", I came across quite a few articles that show that, hilariously (which I actually didn't expect!), Jiujitsu classes were indeed taught around the turn of the 20th century! Here's one, for all those with an open mind, and an ACTUAL interest in history.
Now that that's out of the way... Enola Holmes was a pretty good movie. I did not feel the diversity was too forced, but characterization often got on my nerves as much as it did some other critics and fans of Sherlock Holmes. However, I think after Arsène Lupin, rewritings of Sherlock are honestly not that big of a deal.
This is a movie for teenage girls, made in a time with a harsh political climate. This movie is perfect for that. It has typical teenage girl fiction tropes, of being a tough and strong girl, about being special, and about finding a love by chance (which annoyed me, but I'm not the target audience, so whatever). So I think they did that fantastically. For anybody else, it's just a fun movie for if you want to spend an afternoon with your family watching a light-hearted yet meaningful movie. Not a cinematic masterpiece, but not at all warranting the criticism it receives.",Enola Holmes

1292,blueskiesandrain,Refreshing and entertaining,9,30 September 2020,"Enola Holmes is just as expected. Witty, funny, interesting and mysterious. It is important not to compare Enola Holmes to the Sherlock Holmes movies and to focus on the female lead - as intended. The directors focus on making sure the cast complements Enola and her journey is perfectly portrayed by Sherlock, Mycroft and Millie Bobby Brown's portrayal of Enola is great casting. The film was fun, engaging and worth the wait.",Enola Holmes
1293,neutral-78556,I loved every minute of it,10,1 October 2020,"Ok, first of all I never watched any movie or TV show with Millie Bobby Brown before and I'm also not too familiar with Sherlock Holmes Stories. So there's that. When I saw it pop up on Netflix I wasn't really interested, but I thought I give it a shot. And I must say I loved every minute of it. Millie Bobby Brown playes the character of Enola Holmes brilliantly. Enola is lovely, quirky, funny and clever. I personally think this I a very good movie where a female character is the main role without TRYING hard to be emancipated, she just IS. This is a must see for young girls, and everyone who is tired of seeing only male protagonists/heroes in movies. I lovely reminder that girls can do everything 😉",Enola Holmes
1294,srivastavasanskar-28251,It was excellent but still not good enough.,7,2 October 2020,"Because I liked, no loved, Enola Holmes, it is rather unfortunate that I have to begin this review by saying that it stands in a long line of movie adaptations which do not live up to their source material. The movie alters a lot of characters, rather radically, like Lady Eudoria, who is noted to be an unexpressive woman in Nancy Springer's canon, as opposed to the loving mother in the movie. The other change is Sherlock Holmes himself. In the books, Sherlock's views are perhaps just a mellowed down version of Mycroft's, who, it is to be noted, is not really written as the evil brother. The story itself, undergoes serious changes to make it much more dramatic for a motion pricture. Suffice to say, a lot of content from the books gets lost in the translation.After the rant, because I've just read Springer's novels and loved them, as could not digest the changes for a short while, it is unfair to compare the movie with its source as in doing so, a lot of artistic liberty gets compromised. When treated as a standalone, with no comparisons, Enola Holmes is a full package of mystery and humour with a serious message and a nice take on familial values and and a veiled sort of romance, fit for a movie set in the nineteenth century. Enola is an extremely intriguing character and everyone hopes to see more of her. Henry Cavill's take on Sherlock Holmes is rather refreshing. The highlight, for me was, The Viscount Tewksbury, Marquess of Basilwether, who was simply very entertaining and engaging side character.Regarding the actors, all of them were excellent, if a little too good looking for their respective characters. The format of storytelling was good too, though for some, I've heard, it was irritating, though that is a matter of personal preference.But one element, no, two of them, from the books, which were missing from the movie felt unforgiveable. One, the loss of Enola's innocence when see actually witnesses the real world and notices that there are two sides of London, one for the rich and the other one is the abjectly poor and constantly ignored East end. Nancy Springer's portrayal of the himalayan divide between two sections of London felt sorely missing from the movie because it is such an integral part of Enola and contributes so much to her character. The second, and the one that is more controversial is the martial feminism of modern times that's been thrust into the audience's faces, igonoring any and all social norms of the time, with the characters behaving like normal modern people. It replaces a softer and much more acceptable version, which, instead of proclaiming superiority of one gender, instead revels in the gift of womanhood. In the books, Enola vows never to wear a trouser because one, it would be entirely too clichè and two, because it would show that she feels dishonoured to be a woman. Enola, in Springer's version, revels in the gift of being a woman and does not consider doing 'manly' things to be a necessary element for the empowerment of women. She instead deals with more relateable issues (for women of the time), like tight corsets and strigent social expectations.This movie is worth watching and deserves a sequel, but honestly, a little disappointing for a book reader, for had it followed its source material more closely, it could have been so much more. Overall, I'd like the readers to draw their own conclusions after watching the movie, and recommend them strongly, to read the books as well.",Enola Holmes

1300,treckosentry,As dull as Captain Marvel and the Charlie's Angels reboot...,4,7 October 2020,"Enola Holmes, 4/10. A painful movie to watch. It ultimately butchers the character of the two siblings, Sherlock and Mycroft into useless, stupid, slow incompetent characters so that the movie can showcase the protagonist's (Enola) intellectual prowess; though it fails since the movie isn't about her wit but more on about her mastery of a single move ""The Corkscrew"" to finally defeat the hitman that has been troubling Enola and Tewkesbury. A feminist movie that gives Enola a lot of plot armor that feels as shallow as Brie Larson's Captain Marvel. The portrayal of Mycroft Holmes is inaccurate to the extreme: He's shown as someone who's skinny and was said by other characters as not as clever as Sherlock, but anyone who read the books knows that Mycroft is cleverer than the impressive detective. Henry Cavill's portrayal of Sherlock Holmes is as sad and boring as Bella from Twilight; for a character that can unveil anyone's secrets and life story in a single observation, Sherlock is as dull as a rock and not as talkative like he is from Conan-Doyle's novels. And Henry Cavill shows a character that is sympathetic, kind, and, well mannered, the complete opposite of a calculating, rude, cunning, sharp, and completely aware in an investigation. What also upsets me is the absence of the friend and companion of Sherlock, Dr. Watson. He was completely denied of his existence and makes the story more contradictory since Watson is the one that writes the adventures of the duo and made the public aware of them. The movie was centered on finding her mother and who she really is, but the movie abandons her investigation when she uncovers the plans of her supposedly clever mother to create a relationship with Tewkesbury, solve the mystery, and forces us, viewers, to witness a plot twist that is laughable and felt like something written by M. Night Shyamalan. Enola and Tewkesbury's character is as one-dimensional as the other ineffective feminist-propaganda movies like the characters from the Charlie's Angels reboot. It's meh.",Enola Holmes

The cinematography is innovative and intriguing, and the acting is beyond recognition.Enola Holmes has been an eye opener for me. As a youth and a girl living with the conformities the society has set out for me, I knew exactly how she felt because there are also times when I go through the same experiences as her. It showed how much the community we live in needs so much change. There are people who don't seek for change because they are one of the beneficiaries who indulge themselves even if its not for the betterment of many. It motivated me to speak up even when the world is shutting me down, to move under a limited space so others can thrive and to go out of the box I have been caving myself in. This is something people don't usually realize but because of this movie, I was able to do so. As cliche as it may sound, but Enola Homes changed a part of my life and how I view things were definitely changed into a better perspective. This movie is meant to give a positive message about becoming your own version and not letting society standards dictate what you should be doing.I hope other people will also be able to watch this because, Im sure that they will also learn a lot about themselves, our society and the things that they can do for the future ahead of us.",Enola Holmes

1311,ekaisa,An Ode to Young Girls,9,23 October 2020,"Enola Holmes opens with wisps of hair, loosely tied in a dainty blue ribbon, flowing in the wind as she pedals her bicycle through the gorgeously green backcountry of England and asks a question most of us are all too familiar with - ""Now, where to begin?"" As Enola struggles through the country hills toward the beckoning whistle of a train she's soon to meet, she begins to tell her story. A story that inspires us to choose our own path, to take in the adventure life places in front of us, and to be willing to fight battles some may not be able to fight on their own. This breathtaking and light-hearted movie is an ode to young girls everywhere.
It's the year 1900, the Victorian Age, where society's expectations of women were somewhat ... well, different. These expectations, seemingly more superficial than anything, held women to the standard of heavy petticoats draped over constricting corsets. Enola Holmes, though, is raised with much different expectations. Expectations I can firmly stand behind. Her mother, a ""remarkable woman,"" single-handedly raises a daughter who is intelligent enough to think, fight and decide for herself, despite society and her ever-reaching grasp. Enola Holmes, played wonderfully by Millie Bobby Brown of Stranger Things, outwits her older brothers, Mycroft and Sherlock Holmes (yes, that Sherlock Holmes. No, not quite the same version you may be imagining if you're a fan of the famous detective.), and boards a train to London, England in search of her mother who has mysteriously left Enola to put her deductive thinking skills to the test. Seeing the path that her disapproving older brother has paved for her - dressed up as a nice little finishing school for young ladies - she turns in another direction and blazes a path of her own.
This path, however, is not for the faint of heart. And faint of heart Enola is NOT. A path ridden with an unwelcome stray in the form of a young and handsome Viscount. This chance meeting results in Enola reluctantly fighting off a sinister man, hired to find and kill the Viscount, right before leaping off of the speeding train and rolling onto the edge of a cliff. One adventure leads to another when Enola arrives in London, where she once again faces the sinister man in hand-to-hand combat and encounters a dilemma - press on with her search for her mother (who Enola continues to discover has many secrets of her own) or help the young and vulnerable Viscount whose life she realizes hangs in the balance?
""It is good to care for the vulnerable, but not when it means risking your life. Sometimes you have to let nature take its course."" Wise advice from a wise mother. Regardless of this sound advice, Enola embarks on yet another risky journey to help this stranger-turned-friend figure out why he is being targeted and by whom. Enola's compassion for others shines through, overpowers her mother's resounding voice and leads her to change the world around her. Her life is rewarded with purpose accompanied by a beautiful friendship.
Enola Holmes, the self-proclaimed ""finder of lost souls,"" is a refreshing new character our little sisters, daughters, and nieces can look up to. She's a character whose resolve mothers, aunties, and grandmas can replicate in their little women. The light-footed adventure this movie presents scratches the little itch of wanderlust, even if it is just temporary relief. It's a beautiful reminder to look within yourself for the answers to life's mysteries. To welcome with arms wide open the adventures life throws at you. And to always do what you are capable of to help a soul in need.",Enola Holmes
1312,jloca-64075,Enola Holmes: Uncinching the Girdle on Feminism,10,26 October 2020,"A young girl's coming of age story is met with the feel of a Nancy Drew mystery and the struggle of early 19th century feminist revolutionaries against regressive and oppressive ideals towards women. During an era when women were literally bound by the restrictions of their wardrobes, whale bone corsets symbolized the cultural and societal restraints on their freedom of expression and independence in a patriarchal society. Young Enola Holmes sets out on an adventure far greater than solving the mystery at hand.
The story of Enola Holmes, adolescent sister to the famed detective Sherlock Holmes, represents more than an over shadowed female sibling to the masculine archetype of her brother. The plight of women's rights revolutionaries in the 19th century are unearthed in this coming of age story during a time in our own culture when the hard work of women's rights activist, such as the late Ruth Bader Ginsberg, are threatened by regressive political agendas including attacks on Roe Vs. Wade by conservative politicians who intend to gain more control of the choices women can make for their own bodies.
Enola's name, for which the movie is titled, embodies the deepest underlying theme of this movie and what Enola herself is searching for even more so than the clues that will lead her to solving the mystery of her mother's disappearance. Enola spelled backwards is Alone. Her independence from the clutches of female oppression and more blatantly, the finishing school that her brothers are trying to impose on her, is the aim of the movie. Liberation from male dominance defines the plight of Enola and paves the way for all girls and women in this epic tale of rebellion, revolution and hope.
The movie Enola Holmes begins by establishing the relationship between a young girl and her mother. We learn that Enola's father passed away and her two older brothers have moved away to pursue their own careers. Enola and her mother are left to their own devices. Enola's mother chose to educate her by very unorthodox methods according to the time period. Rather than teaching Enola proper etiquette and home making skills, typical of a young girl's education in 1800's England, she taught her martial arts, Chemistry, Engineering, Literature and the arts; all of which were reserved for the education of males. Without a patriarch overseeing Enola's education, her progressive, feminist mother was free to teach Enola things that most girls her age would never dream of.
Upon the mysterious disappearance of Enola's mother, Endoria Holmes who is played by the quirky Helena Bonham Carter, Enola's older brothers return to their home to take charge of young Enola's care and begin solving the mystery of their mother's disappearance. When Sherlock, played by the stoic Henry Cavill and Mycroft, played by Sam Clafllin arrive, they realize how unorthodox Enola's upbringing and education have been. Sherlock seems to not want to be bothered by Enola's situation and leaves the decision up to his more calloused, older brother who chooses to send Enola to finishing school. Enola has other plans for her future so she sets off to find her mother.
Her sleuthing adventure leads to crossing paths with young Lord Tewkbury, played by Louis Partridge. Although Enola has her own issues to deal with, she is struck by a need to help Lord Tewksbury escape from someone who is out to get him. They soon part ways after he is no longer in immediate danger. She learns some startling information about what her activist mother might be up to and coincidentally that effort is intertwined with the up-and-coming political matters threatening her young beau, Lord Tewksbury.
Enola's quest for answers and independence is laced with political and social conflicts during the 19th century that mirror many of the issues we face today. Her story came out at a time when society could use a reminder to learn from history so that it doesn't repeat itself. Just as progressive ideologies challenging the status quo once led us out of darkness, so should it lead us out of our current shadows into a bright new future.",Enola Holmes

If Nancy Drew had initially existed in 2020, I suppose she'd have been subjected to the same grumbling. Spunky heroines are here to stay, and Enola is firmly in that tradition. As for the people angry at how Sherlock is portrayed, there have been scores of Holmes pastiches in the last century and a quarter. I've read all of the Conan Doyle stories, and this depiction of SH doesn't change canon-it still exists! By the same token, Shakespeare performed by a mixed cast of men AND women doesn't ruin the original. Just watch Enola. It's fun, charming, and non-threatening.",Enola Holmes

1328,drewmik,"Not great, but not the worst either",5,19 January 2021,"The film is painfully average. Visuals and costumes are good, but the writing is...less then stellar. There are also blatant mischaracterizations, historical inaccuracies, and your fair share of plot holes.However, one of the worst aspects of the film is it's feminist moments. Now, for a film about a young female protagonist making her way out into a brave new world, I understand that independence and gender rights are likely going to come up, and that is fine. However, the movie doesn't do a good job. Instead of portraying men and women as equals, like real feminism encourages, it instead makes the male characters out to be evil, a-holes, incompetent, or a mix of the three while female character are almost never in the wrong (Excusing the Duchess who shot her grandson. Obviously.)The acting is mostly solid, though I personally found Enola's whole ""talk to the audience"" shtick grating and irritating. However, that could just be personal preference talking.All together, while it is at times annoying and heavy-handed, the film is not the worst thing to exist ever of all time. take that as you will.",Enola Holmes

I recommend people to watch this movie. I was so intrigued that I started reading the Sherlock Holmes books. I started with the first novel A Study in Scarlet. You must watch this movie. I'm going to rate this on every website it's so underrated. Please watch this I am begging you. No offenses to Milly Bobby Brown. I didn't like Stranger things, but this was a masterpiece of what she did. No offense once again. This is an awesome movie. I want to see more of the sister Eurus and Enola",Enola Holmes
1332,mochandrahamam,This film is very interesting,9,28 April 2021,This film tells Enola Holmes to find his mother who suddenly disappeared and Enola Holmes through many detective puzzles that are very interesting to watch.This film contains a lot of messages about the degree of women in this film depicting that women are strong humans and women are not weak humans. The cinematography in this film is very beautiful and the depiction of old English nuances in this film is very interesting.

1337,kaiaresell,A Delightful Watch,10,10 July 2021,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. I though the actors where great and I loved the fourth wall breaking for Enola. I can see how some people might not enjoy this film and I can still respect and understand because this type of film is surely not suited for everyone. I can also see how some people think it is misleading and ""ruining"" the Sherlock Holmes franchise but I have to disagree specifically seeing as the title of the movie clearly states ""Enola Holmes"" and not Sherlock. Over all, I thought this movie was throughly entertaining and an enjoyable movie that can be watched by the whole family.",Enola Holmes

Milli indeed nailed her portrayal and i couldn't think of anyone else playing that role.",Enola Holmes
1341,cabwriter,Decent enterttainment,7,28 September 2020,"So I watched Enola Holmes on Netflix. Overall I give it a 3 1/2 stars out of five. It was well acted, the costuming was gorgeous, and the plot was interesting if slightly predictable. I may have given it a higher rating if the character of Mycroft Holmes (played by Sam Claflin) had stuck closer to the original stories' portrayal. In my eyes the character was a jerk (Claflin did a good job on the part, by the way, just not my preconception of the character). I would have been much better pleased if he had shown the same intelligence that ACD gave him in the originals.I understand it was based on a more recent novel, which I have not read, so I don't know how closely the movie adhered to the book. Would I watch in again? Probably. Would I recommend it? With the above caveat about Mycroft, yes.",Enola Holmes
1342,dvdjck,A nice adaptation of a YA novel,8,24 September 2020,"I watched this with my 9 year old granddaughter and she loved it. She asked immediately if it was a series. Now she wants to read the books. I feel it is great when top shelf actors are willing to add their skills to these type of projects. I've read the other reviews and disagree about Brown's acting - she was acting the way the character was written in the books. Yes, she is a bit over the top. I don't care. Yet, her approach, I'm sure resonated well with the target audience.
Picky people hated the acting in the early Harry Potter films, and some people hated all of them, yet they endured. This YA series is no where near HP, but it's nice to see young female protagonist.
Maybe she can have a crossover with the Alienist.",Enola Holmes
1343,thedarks-2,Fun Interpretation of the Book Series,8,27 September 2020,I've read a few of the Enola Homles books and after several friends recommended this movie I sat down to watch it. I think they did a very good job interpreting the storyline and feel of the books. I enjoyed watching the movie.I was a little surprised it was a movie instead of planning to make the books into a series (one book per season?). I hope Netflix considers making more of the books into either more movies or series format.History buffs and Holmes purists will probably dislike this movie. I think fans of the books will enjoy seeing the characters come to life.,Enola Holmes

1345,jwerbeloff,I didn't want it to end,9,25 September 2020,"This is the kind of film I wish existed when I was a teen, as Enola Holmes is a wonderful character and she and her mother are an inspiration. The plot, the characters, the costumes made for a wonderful concoction that kept us entranced and and we loved the parallels drawn to the modern age. I also loved the message for all women to find themselves and that doesn't mean she has to be alone. I absolutely loved it and look forward to watching it again.",Enola Holmes

1348,eddie_76114,Charming and life-affirming,10,11 March 2021,"I found this movie very enjoyable to watch.
Millie Bobby Brown is an exceptionally talented and charismatic actress and plays the budding brilliant detective convincingly. The theme is not so much about feminism or women's empowerment as about freedom, the right to live one's own life and mske one's own choices. The reform bill referred to was not about women's suffrage but extending the vote to more men. Women got the vote around 1918, not 1884. One need not be a Sherlock Holmes scholar to enjoy the movie, and it's about Enola, not her brothers. It's visually lovely and quite entertaining. I wouldn't mind a sequel.",Enola Holmes
1349,soheilsh,Propaganda in purest form,2,26 September 2020,A very lame attempt to whitewash the imperial history of England filled with annoying propaganda messages about women empowerment and BLM!! Such a waste of time,Enola Holmes
1350,sillymommy31,This was a fantastic feel good movie!,10,25 September 2020,Millie Bobby Brown is so grown up and I love her performance in this wholesome movie as Sherlock Holmes little sister making her own way in the world. She is so beautiful and talented. I'm glad she gets to show off her versatility as an actress. She was even a producer! Looking forward to what's around the corner for her. Hopefully another Enola Holmes movie!,Enola Holmes
1351,rdehoop,Hardly entertainment value at all,3,24 September 2020,"I was hoping for a great movie, mostly because of the cast, but once again Netflix disappoints with a below average movie. So many things are wrong with this movie. First of all most Sherlock movies focus on a mystery. In this movie there hardly was any mystery at all. The plot was basically about feminism and felt really forced. In a way it reminded me of that terrible new Spike Lee/Netflix movie Da 5 Blood that did the same with 'black live matters'. I am not giving this movie a bad rating because of the feminism though, because I could get past that if there was something else to like about this movie. Funny to see all these feminists on here defending this movie. If you don't like this movie you must be anti feminism..so retarded to think that way. I was just hoping for a nice popcorn movie with fun (familiar) characters, action and some laughs. I got almost none of that. I didn't laugh or smile once. It was just a dull experience with no suspense at all.I wish they would have used the character of Sherlock a little more. Mycroft got a bit more screentime but they are hardly fleshed out characters in this movie. I know it's about Enola, but it seemed like a missed chance to me as they are clearly superior actors. Enola's love interest was overacting in my opinion. His facial expressions just really annoyed me and I had a hard time believing Enola would fall for him at all with his posh accent and his background.Overall I would say that it is an interesting concept but the movie is very lacking in the execution. The interviews with the cast are more interesting than the actual movie.",Enola Holmes
1352,carnicello79,Spectacular,10,2 January 2021,This movie is now one of my favorites. I really wasn't expecting who the protagonist was. This was so much fun to watch.,Enola Holmes

1354,lrngfac97,Fun movie - a pinch of everything!,9,18 October 2020,"In 2020 where bad news seems to bombard one at every turn, this movie is a light, fun distraction!
Enola Holmes is a entertaining film that includes adventure, mystery, and a pinch of romantic energy. There are heroes, villians, and unexpected twists that hook one deeper into the plot - anxious to see the satisfying (yet obvious) outcome.
I highly recommend this movie to young adults - and, those young at heart. When the news is filled with stories that can drag one's spirits down - watch Enola Holmes to have them lifted up - at least for 2hrs. Enjoy!",Enola Holmes
1355,benjamin-engrob,A great movie for all intelligent women and men,10,14 November 2020,"Interesting, unpredictable, funny and charming. I loved it. This movie is great!
And yes, I'm writing this as a man, and apparently some men think the movie is bad because it's shows women as smart and independent. What is wrong with you guys?
Weirdly, it seems you need a bit of intelligence to like Enola Holmes.",Enola Holmes
1356,goheidigo,Lovely surprise! Family Film!,9,9 October 2020,"Where to start? Casting was spot on. Sets & photography was beautiful. Story in some parts wore a bit thin- missed an important opportunity to include more about the suffragette movement, but a nice reveal. Direction, especially with Enola breaking the fourth wall, was great. That is a roll of the dice that doesn't always work. It's a family film which in these Covid days is so needed.

1361,trb1012,Great edition to the Holmes saga,10,24 September 2020,"I thought the movie was excellent on whole and in part. The production values and music were excellent, as the plot.Nineteenth century England finds, both Sherlock and Mycroft's teenaged sister, Enola (""Alone"" spelled backwards) on a quest to find their mother who has unexpectedly and mysteriously left their family home and Enola, being the child remaining there.Along the way, the plot moves at an even paced clip, with Enola recounting and using many of the skills her mother has taught her and exhibiting the brain power that her brothers possess to attempt to find her mother and assist a young traveler, a Viscount running from his wealth, family and responsibilities of peerage.Major threats to life and limb confront Enola, as she discovers more about herself, the times and her family. There is action throughout and I found only one large plot gap; but, it too, folds into an enjoyable bit of of screen viewing, for my part.Everything Is all packaged in an enjoyable film. So much so, I believe it should be a series.",Enola Holmes
1362,mikhaylov-andrey,Very enjoyable family night movie,9,24 September 2020,"Had a great time watching Enola Holmes with 8 and 13 year old - not much to complain about in the movie. Good cast of actors, action and charming performance from Millie Bobby Brown.

1370,rasmus-n-goese,Absolutely wonderful family movie,9,25 September 2020,"I found it well produced, the script was light-hearted and fun.I hope to see this turn into a few more movies, as it was a nice new take on the Holmes universe. And as a family movie it was a solid one.I was a bit sceptical on Henry Cavill playing Sherlock, due to his sheer size. But I was proven wrong, and once again confermed in his ability and range as an actor.
Millie really shows that she is one to look out for in the future, and I'm sure we'll get to see many fantastic movies with her as a lead actress!The only problems I had, hand on my heart, was that I felt a lack of exploration in the characters, and in the closing shot, they drive on the right side. The film is set in, I believe 1884, where as the law made it mandetory in England from 1835 to drive on the left hand side. So I view this as a little mistake they made.9/10 and a 10/10 would watch again.",Enola Holmes

1373,3DsAdventures,A strong introduction,7,23 September 2020,"It was a delightful movie. It was not overly sappy, it kept it thoroughly entertaining throughout. As a detective, it is not so strong. However, this looks like more of an introduction to the characters and much more to come. Things yet unsolved seem like will be answered in a possible future movie. I hope that the actual ""detectiving"" will improve.The actors were splendid, the storyline is fun and it has a nice balance.In many movies with a feminist twist, it overly goes for the theme of ""I don't need a man"", here you see a girl who is logical, deductive but also follows her heart. A strong character who chooses for herself. It gives the message: Follow your own path, make your own choices, and be who you want to be. That is one hell of a message in my opinion.I enjoyed it very much and can't wait for the next installment of Enola Holmes",Enola Holmes

So much so that I went out of my way to write this review.It stands on it's own two feet, with a unique play on the name Holmes. I loved the characters, i loved the plot. I loved how Sherlock was a supporting character, and not the focus.

Then... After 20 minutes of watching, my excitement went away.
I really, really, struggled to stay still for the rest of the movie because, oh well, it's quite boring.
Or maybe i'm not in their target audience. I feel like this movie could be really fun and exciting for pre teens maybe?
First of all, it s so historically inaccurate. And this bothers me. And oh, the feminism promoted in this one. Don't get me started...

What bother you so much ? do you hate to see a female character intelligent or powerful ? or do you hate that the movie ignored so many disgusting historic facts ?some people said rewriting history, don't we dare to dream of history where rights were for everyone ? a world where racism had no place to be in ? where women oppression was fought and won against ?Should cinema always reflect an ill and sad world we are all living in?

1379,ando-k89,Swing and a miss for an expensive lead cast,4,27 September 2020,"Very derivative. So many big names but for some reason not a good performance to be found. Script is boring and unnecessary verbosity is added in place of true wit. Visual style is unoriginal, a straight copy and paste from other Sherlock Holmes and period pieces. Third wall breaks are just pure cringe. The film has quite a diverse cast not yet seen Sherlock Holmes and other period movies, which is good to see but it's incorporated in a very tokenism and tone deaf way that all it does is kind of point to it and takes you immediately out of the story's era.Doesn't surprise me this ended up going to Netflix - and not to the cinema - which seems to be more and more today's equivalent of ""Straight to DVD""",Enola Holmes

1383,kerstin-meinen,You need to calm down,9,29 September 2020,"I honestly enjoyed watching this movie. Was it historically inaccurate? Sure. Do I care? Not at all. Is it very likely to have that amount of people of color as equal parts of society? Not very, but all it did was change the aesthetics and paint a picture of how the world should look like. I don't think, the goal was to make a historically accurate movie, to me it looks like it is a movie made for young people, to be fun and inspiring, which it is. I'm in my thirties and have a degree in history, but I choose to accept the bending of the setting to tell a story.Everyone trying to state, that the modern views and opinions have been shoved in to the wrong period of time seem to fall into the trap of believing that just because they were not heard, these women didn't exist. How do you think we got all the women artists pushing to be accepted in to art schools during the 19th centuries? The female scientists? The women pushing for the right to vote? The ideas were there, they were unfotunately not taken seriously and did not become adapted by everyone, yet. Please explain to me, how women got into postions and jobs not typically taken by females, if the idea of equality and independence did not exist in the 19th century.If you except a traditional Sherlock story, please take another look at the title: This is Enolas story, her point of view, her ideas. All of ot gets (initially) dismissed by her brothers and she sets out to do it her way anyway. Sounds to me like a very typical female story, regardless of the century.I liked Enolas commentary on what was happening, I enjoyed the sets and costumes, the acting, and only kind of understand the critique on the story telling. It felt a bit like a new tv series still searching for its footing, but still: The general feedback baffles me and makes me feel like there are two versions of this film.",Enola Holmes

It's not about Sherlock Holmes, and therefore it's not suppose to show his ""greatness"" (as many fans complain about). It's about Ebola Holmes, his sister. She has her own story to tell. Every single step of her journey shows how great the movie really is. When watching the movie, you're not suppose to think ""sherlock Holmes' sister"". But ""Enola Holmes"" as herself.",Enola Holmes
1390,joluto1213-519-818386,A fun movie,9,27 September 2020,"During these times it's fun to watch something ""light"" and fun. Love Milly Bobby Brown",Enola Holmes
1391,cemerson2012,"Cavill is barely in this movie, which is why I give it a 4 rather than a 3.",4,13 October 2020,"First things first, this is not a Sherlock Holmes story. My only guess as to why this has any appearance of Sherlock is to try to give some context to why Enola acts the way she does. If you're watching this for the Sherlock Holmes story elements, this will not be the movie for you.If you're a casual movie viewer, you might actually enjoy Enola Holmes. If you have any appreciation or appetite for good film making, this movie will frustrate you to death.First the character development is the only bright spot in a dim offering from Netflix. They actually do a decent job with Enola's character arc and her transformation into a mini-detective of sorts. Millie Brown handles the role well in my opinion. The rest of the films execution is just dull. The writing is extremely thin, the conflict is wholly uninteresting, and it seems the writers just couldn't decide what direction the movie needed to go in. Additionally when it came time to button the story up, the ending seemed rushed and that they just forgot why Enola left her brothers in the first place.Second, I feel Netflix has a problem with their films. They spend no time setting up the world the characters live in. Just like in 'Bright', the story quickly becomes a character study with some conflict sprinkled throughout. The viewer is expected to care about the characters and their conflict without a firm understanding of their motivations or the universe in which they live. This makes for a dull and often confusing story. The premise of both Enola Holmes and Bright would work better in a long form series and remove the need for concise storytelling in under 2 hours with less than desirable payoff. Yeah they make reference to her mother a lot, but her mother becomes a seemingly forgettable subplot filled with flashbacks and other calls to previous scenes the viewer just doesn't care about.Third and possibly the worst thing about this movie. THIRD WALL BREAKS belong in Deadpool. Most of them are just plain awkward and add little to the scene.Overall, good performance from Brown. Its good to see her distanced from Stranger Things.Cavill is barely in this movie, which is why I give it a 4 rather than a 3.",Enola Holmes

The movie was littered with boring scenes and dull characters that never really progressed the scattered plot.

Usually in every sherlock series or movies, it is the case that takes the bigger place but in this movie focus on Enola dominates the story and the case to be solved.

1409,ashiskb,Truly Magnificent,9,27 October 2020,"Let me start by my true realisation of the fact that this movie was the best women empowerment movie I've seen or just my favourite rendition of the idea beautifully disguised in the flavour of the Sherlock Holmes world found only before ""truly"" in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's work. The director has done that perfectly and how very cheeky of him to do so. While it is very profoundly out there since the beginning, it did keep cohesion and comprehension until the end. Very flavourfully delightful. The experience is like having a slice of a perfect cake.The reason of taking a star off the rating is nothing really except for the fact that I didn't like it a 10/10. But even to state it so is unfair to artistic liberty and hence I almost considered giving it a 10. However, this movie is not for everyone and not everyone will enjoy it as much as I did. I really like the flavour of the cake but that might be so because I like the flavour amd that it is familiar to me. To be introduced to this movie that has layers over the flavour itself even though magnificent may seem bland to those who miss or dislike the flavour's point. For example, I never liked beer when I tasted it for the first time and it seemed ridiculous that anyone would like it whilst today I enjoy Draught beer even. So, the director had to know it was to be so and hence releasing on Netflix is quite a decent idea, however, it was necessary to market it and get some big names in and even to make it so the children that may watch it may enjoy it fairly along with their parents, was ensured. Brilliant work.This movie could've been something else maybe even worthy of a 10 for me but maybe it was lost in the attempt for inclusiveness and that is quite forgivable. So, in hindsight this movie is a 10... That turned out to be a 9. Or maybe I'm just a fool and my sensibility couldn't comprehend or like it subjectively... I hate that I had to give it a 9 and yet here we are.",Enola Holmes

She was the uncontested star here. There's an Oscar in this young lady's future, guaranteed. The subtleties of her facial expressions, the faultless dialog delivery, and her surprisingly strong physical presence were worthy of an actor far beyond her years.

1439,maivyx,Fun Movie; The Feminism Did Not Bother Me at All,8,23 September 2020,"What I expected coming in to watch Enola was an eccentric film about a young woman solving mystery cases set in late Victorian/early Edwardian times. And that's pretty much what I received! It's fun, it's entertaining, it's quite witty in some places. The setting is beautiful, the actors are great, and there's a variety of characters to enjoy. I do not think this film is perfect-- far from it, in fact. Some of the characters (mostly male) are one-dimensional, not to mention there are a number of historical inaccuracies in the movie... however, overall, I am still happy with it!There are a lot of people who hate this movie for pushing a feminist agenda. However, it did not bother me at all. I did not even THINK about the feminism in this movie until I read the reviews online. There are feminist elements in the movie, but none of the ideas are radical nor tasteless. And a lot of the political ideas in the movie are extremely outdated, so it's difficult to be angry at them (unless there are people today who still expect women to wear corsets?)Overall, I think it's a good movie. I wouldn't watch it expecting some mystery masterpiece, but it's great if you're just looking for some fun :)",Enola Holmes

I found the one star reviews given because women didn't do martial arts in the 1900s and a host of other silly reasons quite ridiculous.In reality, I would have been torn between giving a 7 or 8 for the movie (but leaning more towards 8 because of a very enjoyable cast).",Enola Holmes
1462,kennethbthomas,A Chick Flick Not Meeting The Sherlock Holmes Standards,7,23 September 2020,"The film is kinda underwhelming probably cuz I expected it to be within the 'Sherlock' standards. It has a very cliched story of someone who's on their path of self discovery, who ends up falling in love and the end. It might be probably cuz of the Sherlock series' and movies' influence on me but it's just pretty decent. Don't expect it to be a big mystery movie. I liked the actors playing their parts and even the cinematography for it gives us a visual treat but the story kind of lagged.
I'm a Henry Cavill fan and I think he just did a decent job as Sherlock even when I know that his acting is kind of limited. The other guy who plays Mycroft in the film also does a decent job. The main lead gave a decent performance but the story fell flat. It's probably because of the influence I have through SH movies & series. This is a one time watch movie with not so memorable moments/performances. I'm curious to see Henry in a full fledged Sherlock role maybe in a spin off.
I hope the sequel does justice if there's gonna be one.

1469,giraydayi-37115,This movie is nothing but a cheap propaganda,1,27 September 2020,The movie has nothing to do with Holmes characters and in every scene there is a feminist propaganda i am so sick of it . It SUCKS .,Enola Holmes

1471,oyuncuayan,Does anyone know who is Sherlock Holmes?,4,26 September 2020,"Sherlock Holmes name is a kind of noble name. Everyone can't be Sherlock Holmes. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle did a great job once. He was English and he could imagine who is Sherlock. He created the Sherlock Holmes in his head and he was inspired by one of his doctors. Arthur Conan Doyle knew who is Sherlock. Who doesn't know; Nancy Springer. (Harry Bradbeer too) They created the guy named Sherlock Holmes -the only similarity between the real Sherlock is the names- and they just left it. There are billions of mistakes in the Enola Holmes movie and the books. Sherlock doesn't feel emotions. SHERLOCK DOESN'T FEEL EMOTIONS! It's one of the mistakes. But the movie without Holmes last name is ""okay"". Millie Bobby is a great actress.",Enola Holmes
1472,kiranborkar-09608,Waste use of actors.,6,11 October 2020,"Superb Acting skills have been wasted in this movie along with ""Sherlock"" Reputation",Enola Holmes
1473,megha-19509,A Perfect Entertainer,9,23 September 2020,Drama... Suspense... Romance... Friendship.. Message and of course some Sherlock.. Enola Holmes is a perfect package with Millie Bobby Brown as the star with her stellar performance... This is my first User review for any movie.. so one can imagine the positive impact this movie had on me.. Definitely worth the watch!!!,Enola Holmes
1474,hafizulislamtamal,Mental torture,1,24 September 2020,It took me 4 tries to finish the movie. It was a complete train wreck. A disgrace to Sherlock Holmes realm!,Enola Holmes
1475,muhannadsiddique,Not for Sherlock Holmes fans,1,27 September 2020,Terrible! Just terrible. All about political correctness,Enola Holmes
1476,benjaminpizarrosalinas,There's a little bit of movie in your feminist propaganda,3,24 September 2020,"I'm a Sherlock Holmes fan, so I was excited when they announced this movie.... And I got disappointed so fast...
First the acting. Nothing remarcable. They were just average. And Millie Bobby Brown didn't shine as I thought she would.
The characters are charmless. I couldn't care for anyone... They're woods, no emotions or goals, only fake crying sometimes.
Now the environments were.... Good. Just nice portrait of London, with a few cringy CGI scenes. But it's pasable.
Now the plot. Ow the plot.
The main idea is simple, Enola's mom went missing. So after finding some clues, she goes to find her. It sound good on paper, but it's not good when you watch it...
There are sooo many ""convinient"" things in the movie to helped the plot, that's very lazy...
And what's worse, the movie is ment to be a feminist propaganda, yup. And I know it's okay to show that sometimes, it's important and it's necessary. But the WHOLE thing is about feminism. Later in the movie we figure that Enola's mom is a radical feminist, yes. And she abandoned Enola to join her group of radicals to do a terrorist attack, to show women needs the right to vote and change the world. A terrorist attack that was going to kill people as they showed it in the movie. And what's worst, some people like Enola or Sherlock figured this, but they didn't care. They said ""it might be dangerous"" once, but that's all. After that they continued their lives without caring... An terrorist attack
Okay... I can go on an on talking about the problems with the propaganda in this movie, but I could make a whole review about that, so I'll move to something else.
Let's talk about the characters we now (as Sherlock, Mikroft, and even Lestrad). They're all morons.
Mikroft is an anti feminist guy, so the movie makes him one of the main antagonists. Oh boy
Now Lestrad. He's just useless, seriously. As the chief(I guess) of Scotland Yard, he should be capable of much more. But he can barely catch Enola. And that's all, he's just useless
Now Sherlock. He's just a shadow of what he's supposed to be. They said he solved a lot of cases, they said he's know by everyone by his wisdom and habilities. But he got, literally, beaten by Enola solving the main case. Beaten by a 16 yo that has no knowledge on solving cases, that doesn't know ANYTHING about human behavior (she literally spent her whole life in her house without leaving, just with her mom and her maid). How did this happened?There are a lot of negative points I'm missing in this review, but it would make this eternal. As an advise, if you like the Sherlock Holmes of the books, maybe the one played by Benedict Cumberbatch, or even the one in that Tom & Jerry's crossover, don't watch this. It doesn't do justice to it's legendary characters.
If You're a hardcore Sherlock fan, and you can miss all it's flaws, Enola Holmes can be an entertaining Romantic ""Mystery"" movie. In any other case, skip this...",Enola Holmes
1477,virugautirps,It's boring storyline,4,24 September 2020,"Homes when you heard this name, one thibg comes in your mind... That we are going to see some mysterious things.
But in this movie Enola Homes(Milliebobybrown), Nothing Mysterious
Why I waste my time.
Such a boring storyline..",Enola Holmes
1478,fermmerck,Good mocie,10,4 October 2020,I think this is a good movie. MBB is spectacular. The story is ok. A good movie for family.,Enola Holmes
1479,kellyneenee,Super cute,8,23 September 2020,"If you go into it thinking it's an accurate representation of history you'll hate it. If you go in thinking it's a fun lighthearted movie about a girl finding who she is, you'll love it. I know I went in with the expectations that it wasn't historically accurate and loved it.",Enola Holmes
1480,totahalaa,8/10 what's up with all these negative reviews thank god I didn't listen to them,7,24 September 2020,"It was a very enjoyable movie with interesting adventure and a great message! They didn't spon on Sherlock or Mycrofts characters i agree but it wasn't about them it was about Enola Holmes and i love her she's absolutely wonderful I think millie brown did a wonderful job she was a treat to watch
lovely movie I personally hope for a sequel",Enola Holmes
1481,Mwakibengele,What a man can do a woman can do better??,1,24 September 2020,So it's a movie about how a woman can be a better sleuth than a man.. 😏😏🙄,Enola Holmes
1482,rdormagen-07714,This was a cute funny movie for people under 18,9,25 September 2020,I watched this with my son. He enjoys Sherlock Holmes and he loved this movie. I enjoyed the movie. It wasn't intended for the die hard Sherlock Holmes fans it wasn't intended for angry men that have to have everything perfect. It was an enjoyable funny aesthetically pleasing movie that should get a sequel. I highly recommend it for family movie night and just sit back enjoy the laughs and the adventure.,Enola Holmes
1483,hailgenghiskhan,A cult feminist movie,1,1 October 2020,A pure fiction with no genius minded teen girl( I mean not that much intelligent as rdj Sherlock Holmes..) story runs with a feminist tone...where man is called useless even though so many inventions are made by them and even small boys are also called useless unnecessarily...belive me this film is only for feminists... not for true Sherlock fans and not for genuine humans. finally this movie is not worth of your time.Remember time is not just a concept but it represents your life span.,Enola Holmes

1486,valentinasbogatyrevas,Had to turn it off with 30 minutes to go,1,21 October 2020,"The movie starts of promising but it tries to be too many things at once. The plot is complicated and once you stop watching, you actually don't want to know how it even ends. I couldn't get myself to watch the remaining 30 minutes because it was just extremely boring.",Enola Holmes
1487,bonniebew,A Fun Time,9,24 September 2020,"I feel absolutely certain that, were I still a teenager, I would be obsessed with this movie. As a woman in her 40s, I found it charming.",Enola Holmes

1490,jessinelk,Just good,7,23 September 2020,Brings a nice world and some nicely played characters. Mystery part is not that good,Enola Holmes
1491,darkestmercy,Cute but could've been more,7,27 September 2020,"This was a cute movie to watch, breaking the habit of watching shows.... But I actually wish they'd made it into a short series cuz it gave a lot of potential for one. For the bigger issue of the story, they kind of skated right past it except for what needed to be mentioned. They shoved and bypassed moments that could've been more.",Enola Holmes
1492,sakkaraps,Very classic narrative take on the Sherlock Homes movies.,8,23 September 2020,"Its concept has a fresh feel to it. It has a balanced mix of love, innocence, bold moments stating equality of women and some 'guess what happens next' moments. Its a fairly new story line up for Sherlock so far we have seen in movies and tv series. But i don't think it would have a great after math though. It was good the first time i watched it. I would not think of rewatching it anytime soon.
Thank you.",Enola Holmes
1493,rrking-60663,It just boring,6,27 September 2020,And that's why Benedict Cumberbatch is the best Sherlock,Enola Holmes
1494,conor-o-meara,"Not bad, not great.",5,27 September 2020,"It was a fun watch but felt as though the story was half done, a plot that knew where it was going but missed half the journey. Would have been better as a mini series.",Enola Holmes
1495,renantheodorocosta,"Awful, a kid could write something much better.",1,6 October 2020,Nonsense and extremely predictable.They have forced feminism on this trying to sell or to make it popular.I have lost my time. 5 minutes would be enough to explain this simple movie.,Enola Holmes
1496,taranjeetsandhu,Best movie in the world,10,30 June 2021,I don't know why people giving this movie low ratings. I am 22 year boy and i become a biggest fan of Millie bobby brown after watching this movie. Never find a masterpiece like this. Waiting if there was Enola Holmes 2 in future.,Enola Holmes
