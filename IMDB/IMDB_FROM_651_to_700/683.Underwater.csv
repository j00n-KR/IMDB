0,Leofwine_draca,Average execution,6,22 October 2020,"UNDERWATER is the latest ALIEN rip-off and another ""underwater base"" flick in the spirit of THE ABYSS and LEVIATHAN. Sadly, it's a distinctly average movie let down by a ton of murky underwater photography which is almost as boring as the lengthy undersea scenes in THUNDERBALL. You can't make out what's going on in these scenes apart from an overload of CGI and they're really disappointing. The rest is a predictable story with the usual disaster staples and sudden deaths, although it gets more interesting towards the climax. I'm a huge Lovecraft fan so I loved the main creature in this, although the human-size ones are too obviously ALIEN derived. Kristen Stewart is a poor choice for lead but Jessica Henwick and Vincent Cassel are better. UNDERWATER's okay, but you'd be better off sticking with LEVIATHAN for a more-fun movie.",Underwater
1,SnoopyStyle,one thing after another,6,2 January 2021,"Norah Price (Kristen Stewart) is a mechanic working at the Kepler drilling station, located in the Mariana Trench at the bottom of the ocean. The water starts crushing parts of the station and Norah tries to escape with a few other survivors.This thriller starts almost right away which leads to my initial complaint. The movie does not lay out the setting or give a sense of place before it throws the audience around. I question some of the damage and the construction of the station. Any leaks under that water pressure would be much more damaging. A drip would turn into a water drill that could slice through something solid. I don't like the science in this sci-fi. The movie also needs to lay out the journey in some more detail. There is a quick exposition and map presentation but it skims it a little. I would prefer more clarity. As for the creature feature, it's not anything special. Non of this is anything special. As always, the girls are eventually left hanging out in their underwear although the movie does give a passable explanation. All in all, this is nothing special. There are a few minor thrills. Things happen. It's one thing after another until it's not. It's a popcorn flick of little consequence.",Underwater
2,nogodnomasters,We're not supposed to be down here,5,23 January 2020,"Kristen Stewart plays a mechanical engineer (first unbelievable part) on the deep water ""Kepler"" drilling station owned by TIAN. While brushing her teeth there is a hull breech and the film is in full action and survival mode. Not too hard to figure out (before she does) that there is something out there. They drilled too deep.For some reason it reminded me of Jaws 3D. There was no introduction of characters. We are introduced to the mining operation through news clips during the opening credits. It was weak. I would have rather have seen a group conversation over the issues while building character. Kristen Stewart spends part of film running around in poor lighting in bra and panties. She is no Jane Russell.Guide: 1 quick muttered F-word. No sex or nudity.",Underwater
3,kosmasp,The mystery within,8,4 October 2021,"Disney is sending out checks to reviewers who rate their movies positively? Mine must have been lost in the mail. All kidding aside, our tastes differ and not everyone who disagrees with you is being paid or has any other ulterior motive feeling differently than you.Of course I can only speak for myself. And I can tell you that sometimes not getting all the answers is not a bad thing. If you wonder what kicked of the movie (no pun intended), the inciting incident so to speak. But I think you can piece it together - or at least make up your own mind. I think there are a few answers, some more lilkely than others. But how much do you really care about that? You never get the origin of the ... ""antagonist(s)"" of the movie either and I would not call that a bad thing in any way, shape or form.I also understand if someone is not fond of Kristen Stewart and her sulky exterior she mostly presents in movies. But I think it is fitting in this movie ... having said that, she does not have to carry the movie alone. The co-stars here make all the difference, be it the Deadpool sidekick, the Iron Fist co-star or Vincent Cassel. And a couple of other people too.The cinematography is really good, there are enough scares and tension to keep you on the edge of your seat ... well until the end of the movie, which felt a bit rushed and underwhelming to a certain degree. Still very well made (technically speaking) no doubt about that.",Underwater
4,paul_haakonsen,This was actually phenomenal...,8,10 March 2021,"Right, well as I sat down to watch the 2020 movie ""Underwater"" from writers Brian Duffield and Adam Cozad, I must admit that I didn't really have much of any expectations for the movie.Why? Well, short and simply because the movie had Kristen Stewart in the lead acting role. Yeah, as you might figure, I can't call myself much of a fan of hers. But still, I had the opportunity to watch ""Underwater"", so I did.And color me impressed. This movie was surprisingly good and entertaining. Sort of think ""Alien"" meets ""The Abyss"" and then you essentially have the hybrid that is ""Underwater"". But it gets better, because the end quarter of the movie was pure gold for a Lovecraft fan such as myself. By Dagon, the last quarter of the movie made it so worth watching.Now, don't get me wrong, because I am not saying that the rest of the movie is bad. Because it isn't. Not at all! No, this entire movie was good entertainment from beginning to end. And it felt very much like I was right there in the dark, depths of the ocean with the characters.The visual effects in ""Underwater"" were great. The creature designs were very nice, and definitely had that otherworldly feel to it that you would expect to find in a Lovecraft story. And the reveal of the massive creature, now that was just cosmic dread at its finest. And let's just give a little word of praise out to Dagon as we mention that large underwater creature. The special effects were great and very believable, looking realistic and impressive. And it definitely helped to bring the underwater world to life on the screen. And those underwater suits they were wearing, they were just fantastic; definitely had that ""X-Com: Enemy Unknown"" feeling to it.Sure, I am not a fan of Kristen Stewart no matter what angle I approach her movies from, but I will say that this movie definitely opened up a whole new world, because she was good in the movie and carried herself well enough, amidst the likes of accomplished performers Vincent Cassel, T.J. Miller and Jessica Henwick.The atmosphere in the movie was just great, as there was a clear and present sensation of impending doom, either at the imploding underwater station, or at the tentacled doom of the underwater creatures - once they were introduced and became part of the movie. But the whole movie was just so nicely done in terms of atmosphere and details. It was pure joy to sit through this movie actually in terms of visuals and presentation.You most certainly should watch ""Underwater"", even if you have an aversion towards Kristen Stewart, as I did, because this movie is entertaining and it is surprisingly good. A very good combination of thriller, action and cosmic dread - horror. And if you are a fan of Lovecraftian fiction, then you will most certainly get a kick out of ""Underwater"".My rating of ""Underwater"" lands on an eight out of ten stars.",Underwater
5,zardoz-13,"""Alien"" Meets ""The Abyss"" Without Flair",7,7 February 2020,"Imagine Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" (1979) mashed up with James Cameron's ""The Abyss"" (1988), and you'll have a clue about what awaits you in ""Underwater,"" an energetic ""Deepwater Horizon"" (2016) disaster movie cross-bred with a harebrained, B-movie creature feature. Since ""Twilight"" actress Kristen Stewart wants to be taken seriously, she has close-cropped her hair, cavorts about in a sports bra, and wears nerdy glasses. After all Hell breaks loose, Stewart and a tiny group of survivors don huge Michelin Man diving suits. The escape pods have all malfunctioned, but the captain is sure a nearby facility has operational escape pods. However, they must tramp for mile or so across the ocean floor until they reach the other facility. Initially, ""Signal"" director William Eubanks looks like he was content with making a gripping disaster epic about a troubled corporate drilling platform boring the Mariana Trench, seven miles below the surface. An earthquake erupts, and everything goes sideways. Clocking in at 95 nerve-racking minutes, ""Underwater"" qualifies as a white-knuckled exercise in suspense which may make you feel like you're trapped in that ""Star Wars"" trash compactor in ""Episode IV - A New Hope"" (1977). Anybody who suffers from bouts of claustrophobia should prepare themselves for some tight spots. ""Underwater"" doesn't let you to get comfortably seated before the bottom falls out. For the first half-hour, this tense, atmospheric opus will make you cringe because the only way to escape imminent death is to wriggle around one heap of wreckage after another and hope fate doesn't serve you up as hors d'oeuvres. About 45 minutes later, it dawns on our survivors that they may have something else to worry about than the next subterranean tremor. Indeed, somewhere out there on the gloomy ocean floor lurks a new aquatic lifeform like no other that feasts on human flesh as if it were a delicacy. ""Underwater"" qualifies as the kind of 'no holds barred' thriller that gives neither its characters nor the audience an easy way out of its death-defying quandary. Moreover, Eubanks and scenarists Brian Duffield of ""Insurgent"" and Adam Cozad of ""Legend of Tarzan"" maintain a sense of balance between the disaster plot and the monster plot until the last quarter-hour when those scary lifeforms awaken from a nap and ring the dinner bell. Sadly, the CGI is not up standards, and the monsters amount to hokum.
Norah (Kristen Stewart) serves as a mechanical engineer for Tian Industries aboard the deepest undersea drilling rig in the world. No sooner has she awakened than one disaster follows another in rapid succession. One hull breach after another has her scrambling to keep from being fish food as water swamps the facility with explosive menace. Initially, everybody believes an earthquake is the culprit, and only a handful of personnel have survived the tragedy. Along with Norah are the Captain (Vincent Cassel of ""Ocean's Twelve""), Emily (Jessica Henwick of ""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens""), Paul (T.J. Miller of ""Deadpool""), Smith (John Gallagher Jr. of ""Jonah Hex""), and Rodrigo (Mamoudou Athie of ""The Circle""). You don't have to be a genius to figure out as the story unfolds, some of them will fall prey to either the treacherous deep-sea or the ghastly but ghostly monsters that assemble by the hundreds. Our heroes and heroines encounter one setback after another, and they aren't sure what to think when they lay eyes on these amorphous monsters. Eubanks and his writers do a good job of painting the survivors into a corner. As their resident comedian, Paul takes it upon himself to provide the comic relief from all doom and gloom. Initially, his sarcastic banter provides some chuckles. Gradually, as our heroes and heroines find themselves getting deeper and deeper into the unknown, Paul's humor wears out his welcome. T.J. Miller's sarcasm did wonders for the ""Deadpool"" superhero yarns. After a while, you just want the aliens to gorge themselves on his carcass. Inevitably, the monsters single out Norah as their prey. The last thing you want to do when you are in the presence of these monsters is to blind them with your helmet headlights. This agitates them, and they will attack. Norah comes prepared for just such an eventuality. She has appropriated a clumsy flare pistol. Suffice to say, when one of these slimy looking haunts tangles with her, Norah lets it have it with the flare pistol. Happily, she survives this encounter, but others aren't so fortunate.
The problem with ""Underwater"" is it aims no higher than a waterlogged ""Alien,"" despite the fact Eubanks stages several tour-de-force scenes that have nothing to do with alien infestation. Watching these technicians struggle against deadlines to avert the next breach which threatens to drown them all is what keeps ""Underwater"" captivating during its first hour. The adrenalin rush that comes from this constant threat of death when you least expect it provides the movie with a sense of rhythm. Little by little, Eubanks and his writers work the monsters inconspicuously into the storyline. Unfortunately, our heroes and heroine have no ideas how lethal these aquatic adversaries are. Similarly, we the audiences are just as clueless. The evil corporation in the ""Alien"" movies had an android character among the survivors who could spout data about any threat. No such character inhabits ""Underwater,"" but it doesn't take a genius to figure out that something corporate stinks.
Ultimately, what sinks all the pent-up tension that Eubanks has drummed up in ""Underwater"" is the sight of the mother monster which has populated the rig with hundreds of its spawn. Basically, this creature resembles a crepe paper dragon that you might witness at a Chinatown parade. Despite this hokum, ""Underwater"" never takes a break from the action. Just when the survivors think that they have it made, more terrifying things happen. Sadly, ""Underwater"" might have been more compelling had the filmmakers confined themselves to the disaster plot rather than piggyback a monster invasion on it.",Underwater
6,view_and_review,Don't Arrive Late to the Theater,7,18 January 2020,"""Underwater"" almost immediately thrust the audience into a panic situation. Not even a word had been uttered before the underwater rig was imploding. After the major damage was done 70% of the underwater station was compromised and presumably over 300 crew members were dead. We were left following six.It was a remarkable set design, you can tell a lot of money and time went into it. The six crew members had to navigate a mass of twisted metal, hanging wires, busted concrete, and everything else that is reminiscent of a demolition site. And that was when they were inside.I can say that every character was one that you could pull for. There wasn't the jerk, the coward, or the double-crosser. They were all characteristically unique, yet all good teammates. There were four men and two women and you know not everyone is surviving. If all six did survive it would take a miracle considering that they were contending with being nearly seven miles underwater, they were cut off from topside, hardly anything worked, they had to abandon the rig they were in for another rig, and oh yeah... there were some deep sea creatures to avoid as well.I don't think I've seen an underwater movie this claustrophobic and desperate since ""Deep Blue Sea,"" and ""The Abyss"" before that. This movie didn't rely on script so much as it relied on atmosphere. It was all about the desperateness of the place and the situation. I honestly didn't think I'd like it judging from the trailers, but I was willing to give it a try. Glad I did.",Underwater
7,ferguson-6,survival thriller more than creature feature,5,10 January 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. The opening credits have an ""X-Files"" look and feel. Newspaper headlines and redacted reports zip by ... in fact, the rapid cuts are so quick that very few viewers will be able to keep up. Even if you haven't finished your Evelyn Woods speed-reading course, the gist is clear: there is a (very) deep-water drilling lab located 36,000 feet below the ocean's surface. Yep, that's almost 7 miles deep for the crew of 316, and some mysterious bad things may or may not be lurking. That's really our only set-up ... unless you want to count Kristen Stewart brushing her teeth.It's literally less than 5 minutes in when the rig is rocked by an explosion of some kind. We are told the structure is 70% damaged. The survivors are quickly identified. Nora (Ms. Stewart) and Rodrigo (Mamoudou Athie) are together in the immediate aftermath. Nora is a mechanical engineer and computer whiz. They soon come across a co-worker buried in rubble. It's wise-cracking TJ Miller and his (actual) stuffed bunny. Next up are the Captain (Vincent Cassel) and lovebirds Emily (Jessica Henwick) and Smith (John Gallagher Jr). With no time for early character development, we learn tidbits as their perilous journey hopefully leads them towards rescue. Of course anyone who has ever watched a movie can tell you, they won't all make it. Maybe the 8 year old girl sitting in the row behind me wouldn't know that ... but no parent should take their 8 year old to a PG-13 movie that has ""terror"" in the parental warnings.Director William Eubank and co-writers Brian Duffield and Adam Cozad create plenty of tension, danger and suspense. The movie is at its best when they let the moment speak. It's the dialogue that is mostly cringe-worthy, as well as the predictable and unnecessary jump-scares. These people are stranded miles deep in the ocean and are running out of oxygen and options ... and are being chased by something they can't identify. The visual effects are successful in generating the environment of danger and claustrophobia.It's in the little things where the film falters. When we first see the Captain, he has his arm in a sling. He's obviously injured. Once the bulky underwater suits are donned, his bad arm seems just fine ... he's even pulling one of the others with a rope! Nora makes a big deal about being the ""smallest"" of the group and volunteers to explore a narrow passage. The problem is that they are all wearing the same suits - a fact that should negate any advantage of Ms., Stewart's slim, toned body. Lastly, the film has borrowed heavily from James Cameron's classic ALIEN. In fact, it has been referred to as ""Underwater Alien"". Of course, this film isn't nearly as well-rounded or complete as that one ... but then few are.Mr. Eubank's film is a sci-fi/horror mash-up, but it's really more a survival thriller than science fiction or creature feature, although the sea creatures have their moments. Cinematographer Bojan Bozelli does a nice job in keeping with the 'play it straight' approach, and his camera work is complemented by the electronic score from Marco Beltrami and Brandon Roberts. Ms. Stewart and her buzzed blond hair hold their own amidst the danger. A blatant lecture about how we are going places (deep sea) we shouldn't go and doing things (drilling) we shouldn't do is included for those who might not figure it out on their own, but mostly we spend our time trying to figure out how to survive the deep sea pressure with little oxygen and no escape pods. Just leave the 8-year olds at home.",Underwater
8,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Highly enjoyable mainstream genre effort,9,15 April 2020,"Working for an underwater drilling station, the crew finds themselves under attack by a mysterious series of accidents that have trapped them on the ocean floor miles underwater and must try to get to the lone possible escape method to get topside, only for an unforeseen creature to impede their plans.This one was quite enjoyable when it worked. Among it's better qualities is the overall fine setup at play that features some rather enjoyable setups which are rather fun at points. With the opening destruction of the various rooms and hallways in the station, the race to get to safety away from the crumbling walls and onrushing water serves this incredibly well with the chaotic nature of the situation immediately into the film to get it started on a frantic note. The ensuing chaos and unpredictable nature of what's going on with the station exploding and failing around them unexpectedly turns into a fine series of escape plans to get to a stable environment where they can regroup and get their bearings on what's happening, allowing this to turn into a rather fun survival thriller with the different obstacles they need to overcome to escape the station. Managing to become incredibly suspenseful and claustrophobic about their trip through the unknown conditions of the situation, this section of the film gets off to a fine start. The other enjoyable aspect featured here is the final half where they've survived and become aware of what's been stalking them throughout the compound. The first attacks with the strange creatures are rather enjoyable, featuring the survivors coming upon the creatures feeding on the remains of the deceased crewmember which is all the better with the strange lighting and bizarre look of the creatures. Later scenes including the attack on the group getting into the station or the ambush inside the lift as they get into the main tower of the crumbling facility come off rather nicely, featuring a nice use of the budgetary resources to generate some spectacle in the sequence. The big finale, featuring the last-ditch effort to get out of the doomed facility before it explodes and the creatures get inside, gets incredibly enjoyable as the slick and glossy visuals offer quite suspenseful moments within the frantic action as the cliffhanger involving the monster attacking them has a lot to like. Overall, these here keep the film up over its minor drawbacks. There are a few minor problems with this one. Among its main flaws is the fact that there are some rather unnecessary aspects to their escape route that don't need to be there. A detour into rescuing a potential survivor that's out of the way of their projected route when they're on a deadline to get out alive serves no purpose and results in no real surprises when they encounter unexpected obstacles that later affect their trip. Scenes of them going for food and special item retrieval missions that enable the creatures to attack aren't too surprising, and an attack where a guided recovery system allows the creatures to follow the crew comes off incredibly confusing not just in the on-screen action but how they managed to ignore that aspect of their trip. As well, some might find fault with some woefully unfunny comedic relief attempted here which seems highly unprofessional and completely at odds with the purpose behind the company's protocols who would've eliminated that kind of behavior and immaturity from their ranks. Otherwise, there isn't much to dislike here.Rated PG-13: Violence and Language.",Underwater
9,phd_travel,Hard to make out what was going on,2,30 January 2020,Very disappointing. The story is irritating and the cinematography is too dark. Couldn't make out what was going on most of the time. If they are going to make a movie why not make it clearer! Quite a lot of the movie was boring. When something exciting happened it was over too fast. The squid like monster seemed a bit like a blast from the past.I am a K Stew fan but she wasn't great here. Only someone with such a pretty face could pull of that crew cut. Her diction needs to improve. She speaks too fast. Didn't catch some of what she was saying. She didn't seem to express fear that well. Even the supporiting character played by Jessica Henwick was better at emoting fear. Didn't really make the other characters interesting.Need to look to Koreans on how to make a good monster movie.,Underwater
10,trashgang,Alien under water,7,8 April 2020,"What i wrote in the summary is exactly what i mean, it reminded me a lot of alien due so many ways. Not storywise but what is happening sometimes, the baby humanoid creatures, reminded me of the eggs. The one being dragged by the monster and one creature is taken on board. and I can go on and on.But forget that, it's entertainment from the beginning until the end and it do has it moments. Still you can easily spot who is going to die. And the reason why Kristen is walking around a lot in her underwear is also a mysery. everybody is wearing clothes but she is mostly walking without clothes, in underwear.If you are into creature features you will adore this, it also reminded me on part of the monster of Cloverfield somehow. Still, Kristen did a nice job, i liked it, it's not going to win an Oscar but its well above mediocre. Some nice effects used (superslomo), sometimes a bit of weird editing too.

11,deloudelouvain,It's not tomorrow I will start diving after watching this one.,8,12 April 2020,"I'm surprised by the low ratings this movie gets, and the negative reviews, those are even worse to read. I wonder what people expect from an underwater horror movie? It's exactly what I wanted, a claustrophobic feeling during the entire movie, it made me sit at the edge of my seat from beginning till the end. I get anxious just by watching Underwater, certainly a thing I wouldn't do in real life, but it's a pleasant anxious feeling as I'm not in danger at all, just watching others suffer is enough for me. I don't know why you would want to compare this movie with The Abyss (which was also an excellent movie by the way), don't see the point of that, just enjoy this one, or skip this one and rewatch the 1989 classic but don't compare it. The acting wasn't bad at all, again I don't get why people criticize Kristen Stewart for this one, she did a good job playing her character. The only thing we learned here is that women shouldn't cut their hair short unless you want to be lesser attractive, then it's a good choice. Vincent Cassel never fails to deliver, and so did he again in this movie. The CGI's were not bad at all, and even if the movie is pretty dark (it's at the bottom of the ocean so that makes perfect sense) it's still good enough to be visually attractive. Underwater is suspense for the entire time, and that's the only thing I wanted when watching an underwater movie. Don't listen to the negative reviews, this one is way better than I expected after reading those misleading reviews.",Underwater
12,siderite,"It could have been good, but it had no flesh",6,27 March 2020,"Semi naked Kristen Stewart, weird French violent Vincent Cassel and some relatively known meat for the secondary character in an underwater adventure. It could have been, if not a classic, something decent. Unfortunately they used zero effort to flesh out the characters, so in the end they seemed just numbers. The entire setup... flashback news reports in papers. The aftermath? More papers. The story, just some people trying to survive and doing it by luck alone. It could have been more like The Abyss, but instead it was a bad remake of Deepstar Six. Too bad.Also, pressure and water don't work that way.",Underwater
13,FeastMode,fun horror flick,7,20 September 2020,"I enjoy these types of movies. it wasn't anything special. but it was suspenseful and i enjoyed the experience. lots of cool moments and scary sequences. a good time overall (1 viewing, 9/19/2020)",Underwater
14,lost-in-limbo,A familiar dip into the deep.,5,16 April 2020,"At 90mins you get a quick and breezy creature-feature outing of simple b-origins. It's a fine film, if nothing more. It doesn't pretend to be anything else other than a roller coaster ride. No real standout set-pieces, which leave a lasting impression but there are a few moments which give you a quick rush. Likely all forgotten a week later.Surprisingly I enjoyed the 30 min claustrophobic build-up and mystery way more, and that's before the monsters' screen time takes centre stage. And it really throws you right into the disaster, much quicker than expected and tautly takes hold as you gather info on the fly. The first death surprised me. However it seems to go for jump scares when the focus shifted to the creatures, and in doing so it sorta lacked tension at times, even character tension. Maybe this is because we don't get any time with the characters before the chaos hits the fan. As for the murky imagery of the underwater scenes, it didn't bother me much, compared to say the editing around the attack scenes. But my interest was definitely beginning to drift, especially when the group (in their indistinguishable suits) are walking around on the ocean bed. It's not until Kristen Stewart's ingestive encounter and a Lovecraft-like monster reveal is where it had me hooked again. Too bad this magnificent looking beast comes on too late. The acting chops of the headlining cast, makes up for the thinly written character beats. It's actually quite strong showing by Kristen Stewart, who really does pull you along for the ride. Making the most of her part, and definitely holding the picture together. Hell, even TJ Miller was bearable.",Underwater
15,bowmanblue,'Alien' (only underwater),7,14 May 2020,"Imagine 'Alien.' Now imagine 'Alien' set under the sea. There you have my entire plot summary of 2020's 'Underwater.' I would say that 'Underwater' has to be one of the most unoriginal films ever created over recent times. There is absolutely nothing to see here that you haven't seen a hundred times before in various 'post Alien' sci-fi/horror movies. That sounds like I'm ripping on the film, yet - amazingly - I actually quite enjoyed it.Apparently, it was made in 2017 and sat on the shelf until 2020. I guess I wasn't expecting much and my expectations were at 'absolute zero' when I decided to watch it. That's probably a helpful way of watching it - don't expect too much (and certainly don't expect anything vaguely original).I know it's fashionable to hate on Kristen Stewart, but let's not judge her on one franchise containing sparkling vampires. She's actually quite a capable actress and, although her performance as the lead role here won't win her any Oscars, she does the job. Plus the film does get right into things. In the opening scene the underwater drilling facility begins to explode, causing a handful of survivors to try and find a way to make it all the way up from the bottom of the ocean to the surface. And, as if that wasn't difficult enough, there's something out there waiting for them.There's not a huge cast which at least gives us the chance to get to know some of them before bad things really start to happen. I thought Vincent Cassel certainly was the best among the supporting cast (even though I had a shrewd feeling I knew exactly what was going to happen to him and I was proved right). However, Jessica Henwick just seemed absolutely wooden at all times. I'd never really seen her in anything and thought she must be an American trying to put on a British accent. After a quick check online I found she was British, meaning her accent sounds fake even to a native like me!I know this is just a 'glorified B-movie,' but the special effects were actually pretty good. Yes, most of the surroundings etc were computer generated, but because the environment was supposed to be murky anyway, the CGI wasn't in any way noticeable.As I've said, 'Underwater' provides absolutely nothing new for the genre, but when that's a film's only real flaw, it makes it worth a watch if you're looking for something new in terms of a 'monster-munching movie.'",Underwater
16,ThomasDrufke,Had a Promising Start,5,28 January 2020,"January guilty pleasure? Sure. But is Underwater a film that almost certainly will be forgotten in a few months time? Certainly. A promising start is ruined by an overly produced/directed/written thriller that can only be described as merely 'meh'. For a much better underwater thrill ride, see 47 Meters Down. That movie knows what it is and never tries to be much more. There was something here before things became drowned with CGI monsters and crappy dialogue.5.8/10",Underwater
17,Cineanalyst,Cloverfield Under the Sea,2,22 April 2021,"How is this not part of the Cloverfield marketing scheme that's passed off as a film franchise? Oh, is it? No? Whatever, it's basically the same thing as the 2008 flick, but ""Underwater."" (In this case, by the way, creativity of title is an indication of the innovation throughout the rest of the movie--zilch.) There's a mysterious attack, explosions and such. A group of people, then, devise to travel somewhere mostly by foot. Lots of rubble and dead or dying people. T. J. Miller is cast in both to make wise cracks while we hardly see his face. There's even an extended POV shot here from his perspective when they first encounter one of the monsters, which recalls Miller's role behind the camera of the mock found footage of ""Cloverfield."" Finally, we get to see the big monster, and it looks pretty much the same as the one in ""Cloverfield,"" or at least as I remember hardly-discernable globs of CGI.""Underwater"" is derivative and terribly formulaic in other ways, too. The opening and closing credits include a bunch of newsprint-type reports regarding the drilling apparatus that is the setting of the movie. These scenes are an example of when reading is regrettable. See, the kaiju here is a metaphor, too--they swear it is--just like ""King Kong"" (1933), ""Godzilla"" (1954) and even that 9/11 allegory of ""Cloverfield."" Drilling for natural resources bad, you see, because it = monsters.Miller's character carries around a white rabbit doll and explicitly references ""Alice in Wonderland."" This garbage pretends association with the most sophisticated piece of children's literature in the English language. What incredulous, pretentious stupidity.Many tired tropes here, too. It's a lousy horror flick, so the black guy dies first. Lot of dull dark screen time as a transparent means to set up jump scares. The paternal figure sacrifices himself by disconnecting the tether between him and the heroine--seen that one a gazillion times. Kind of reminds me how this also wants to be a bit of underwater ""Gravity"" (2013), but instead doesn't look very good and actually spends too much time on character development. At 95 minutes, this is relatively short for a generic horror kaiju nowadays, I suppose, but it could've been shorter and, thus, not as tedious.Oh, one character has a daughter? Another's partner died? That one likes dogs? And that man-child over there is tender towards a toy, you say? I don't care. I get it; they're people who care about others or things, and so I, the spectator, should care about them, right? No, I don't care. ""Gravity"" had it right: symbolic humanism. Not this cardboard-cutout simulacrum of people. By the time they get to waxing sentimental about the stream of debris of some dead person's Moon Pie-littered garbage and materialist possessions--in a movie where the monster supposedly contains an environmental message, remember--or was it a Luddite message... anyways, I think it hurt my brain. (Hence, this rambling review.)Have Kristen Stewart run around in her underwear as much as you want; it's not going to help... much. But, hey, make a point of explaining that they need to remove their pants to get into their diving suits, and show supposedly-funny close-up of Miller's butt, because male butts funny, no? That way nobody will accuse you of exploiting the PG-13 version of sex appeal.The only other thing I kind of liked was the corporate propaganda playing in the background as the machinery malfunctioned--reminds me a lot of a real workplace assaulting their own employees with that garbage. Otherwise, I'm going to pretend ""Underwater"" was so bad that it single-handedly killed the ""Fox"" in ""20th Century Studios."" Alas, I know it was sadly real corporatist propaganda and a clash of so-called corporate values between right-wing windbags and another cartoon mouse that ruined the studio William Fox had built into a hostile takeover, personal bankruptcy, and one of the worst Hollywood records for the survival of silent films... Fox was the major studio behind sound-on-film technology, though. I'm no good at eulogies.",Underwater

What i got here was a good opening of the movie, and involving second act. What i got in a third act was not was i expected as the movie was kinda leading me to. After all the mystery, at the end it was basically a ""Godzilla"" underwater VS Kristen Stewart in her underwear running around the space station .., oh i'm sorry - underwater station.

20,westsideschl,Dumb Beyond Belief,2,9 May 2020,"I actually wanted to like it having seen numerous deep ocean human escape from submerged habitat disaster movies in past decades. Unlike ""The Rhythm Section"" which had a realness to it, and ""Bloodshot"" which was pure comic book fantasy, this was pure dumb per the following:
1. Submerged habitat was several hundred feet tall so construction dealing with currents & pressures would be harder than building habitat on the Moon or Mars.
2. Mostly made of 12-18"" thick concrete which begs the question how do you get it down there; how do you make & then build it in that environment? Most importantly the best imaginable concrete has a psi of maybe 5000, but the psi in the Mariana Trench is 16,000. Good luck!
3. Lots of extraneous, expensive to transport & build, stuff, e.g. floor & wall tiles & metal lockers, etc. in the film because of the cheap shooting location.
4. Dialogue was out-of-place for that environment; gossipy dumb. Usual stereotypical actor mix of black, asian, nerd, goofball. And, you know who's likely to not make it.
5. First cheap scary's - dripping water, loud rumbling. Imaginative!
6. Crowning glory were the alien like creatures subsisting on - who knows what, in that barren environment. Human alien looking with head, mouth (and of course sharp teeth), nose, two eyes, arms & legs. Second alien, much larger, half squid; half human. Surviving that pressure is comic book fantasy.",Underwater

22,slightlymad22,Much Better Than You'd Expect!! I Really Enjoyed It,7,10 February 2020,"I just got out of Underwater.This was made in 2017, before Disney bought Fox, now I don't think Disney care about this movie, as they are just dumping it out with minimum publicity. I have seen two posters, and I only seen the trailer here.Now, I actually thought it was ok, in fact I enjoyed it, It's as cliche as it gets, but it it gets straight to it, the explanation for why they are their is told over the opening credits, so no exposition is needed!! It is insanely claustrophobic and has a few moments of genuine intensity and it is entertaining. Don't get me wrong, I have plenty of issues with it (I hated Stewart's voice over!! Not seems totally out of place) but it was not as bad as I expected and I was mostly entertained throughout. About 40/50 minutes in, I said to my girlfriend ""I'm actually enjoying this"" but once you see the creature, it kind of lost something.Kristen Stewart was ok, not as good as she was in Charlies Angels, because I found her funny in that, but she was ok. She seems to be much better in things like Seberg than more commercial movies like this. She is no Sigourney Weaver, that is for sure.As for the running around in her underwear her jacket is not fastened during the opening and you see her in get stripped down getting in and out of her suit (as you do all the cast) the end is the longest period, where they get out of their suits and run to the escape pods. So not great deal, and you do not see anything.Vincent Cassel an actor I always I like seeing was fine in his role as the Captain too, but sadly he is sort of wasted as he isn't really given a lot to do.Too many times, Underwater reminded me of better movies and the characters are pretty wafer-thin and walking cliche's, but you don't watch movies like this expecting great characterisation!!Surprisingly, for the first time ever, there were adverts and no trailers at all... Do studio's think nobody will go and see this and have not bothered attaching their new trailers to it??",Underwater

24,paulclaassen,"Been there, done that, but not bad.",5,10 November 2020,"The premise is nothing new. We've seen it so many times before: DeepStar Six, Leviathon, Alien...Since 'Underwater' doesn't really bring anything new to the table, what would make me recommend it? Hmm, nothing really. Unless you enjoy this sort of genre and want to watch yet another film on the subject that might as well have been a remake of these films. I didn't think people actually still take Kristen Stewart seriously, but she does a damn fine job here. She leads the film almost as effectively as Sigourney Weaver does in the Alien movies.Kristen Stewart stars as Norah, the film's heroin and star attraction. Norah is a very strong, yet very sensitive character. And Stewart does her justice. I enjoyed the entire cast, and characters. Thankfully there were no cliched conflict between characters you generally find in these genre films. Instead, the survivors worked together like a team, and it was a refreshing change from the norm. TJ Miller stars as Paul, who allowed for the film's comic relief. Again, unlike other films, this character wasn't overdone or slapstick. His humor was more like a character trait, and funny in a very subtle way, and Paul was a likable character.There's loads of action and suspense here to keep the viewer interested. Thanks to the film's short running time, its tight and fast-paced, which I enjoyed.Would I watch it again? Maybe.",Underwater
25,Thanos_Alfie,Predictable...,4,3 April 2020,"""Underwater"" is an Action - Horror movie in which we watch a group of oceanic researchers who are working for a very famous drilling company in a facility located at the bottom of the Mariana Trench trying to reach the capsules in order to survive after the occurrence of a mysterious earthquake.I have to admit that after watching the trailer of this movie I had high expectations from it and unfortunately I was disappointed. I expected more suspense and even more action than what I watched. The direction which was made by William Eubank was poor and I didn't like that not even one character of this movie developed because I believe that in these kind of movies the most important is the character development. Regarding the interpretations, I have to say that I expected more from Vincent Cassel who played as Captain and Kristen Stewart who played as Norah and I believe that they both didn't reach their true potential. One good interpretation that has to be mentioned was T.J. Miller's who played as Paul and he was very good but this interpretation wasn't enough to save this movie despite the different touch it gave to it. If you are a fan of Horror movies then this movie isn't for you and it would be better not to watch it but even if you are not a fan of those kind of movies don't watch it because you are going to waste your time.",Underwater
26,cruise01,A sci fi horror movie that grabs you and does not let you go to catch a breath.,7,10 January 2020,"Underwater (3.5 out of 5 stars).Underwater is a science fiction horror film that delivers a claustrophobia thriller with a good cast ensemble and performances, edgy music score, and a direction that feels like this film is trying to bring back a 1980s sci fi thriller like Alien movies, The Thing, or The Abyss (minus the creatures in this movie). I will say the film packs a punch with putting you into the action in the opening scene when an underwater facility is torn apart. Survivors Norah (Kristen Stewart), Paul (T.J. Miller), Lucien (Vincent Cassel), Emily (Jessica Henwick), and Liam (John Gallagher Jr.) are trying to make a way to the other station to find the evacuation pods. While the earthquake that shook the facility was not an ordinary quake. The drilling station has awakened something on the oceans surface with creatures that are trying to hunt the remaining survivors.May not be a fresh plot or concept idea. Underwater facility drilling in the oceans surface. Releasing some giant monstrous beast. And an army of humanoid creatures. The concept and plot is still exciting. As a group of survivors are trying to survive and escape from the stations before it collapses onto each other. They will go into claustrophobic settings of crawling into tight spaces. Or walking out onto the ocean surface with big underwater suits. Which the camera pans into their faces making it feel claustrophobia with the darkness out in the deep sea. Which anything can come into their faces at any given moment. I will say the film is intense and thrilling not really scary at all. It does try for a few jump scares with something running towards you. Or popping out in front of the screen.The cast ensemble was good. Kristen Stewart's performance is good playing Norah, a character that is struggling on leaving people behind in life and death situations. Stewart is coming along way with her acting. And she worked great in delivering the role. The music score by Marco Beltrami and Brandon Roberts worked well delivering an edgy sci fi horror movie tone. Director William Eubank did a good job in creating a sci fi horror film. The movie begins with action and never stops for a breath until the credits roll. The first half is about characters trying to survive the wreckage. While the other half is the people getting killed off by a creature which barely shows. And they are trying to survive and escape.I will say my one issue with the movie is the quick editing cuts when the creatures are attacking them. The lighting is dark as it is cause they are out on the sea floor. It is a lot of fast editing cuts and shaky camera movements which can make it a little confusing. Sure, it was probably done to create the intensity direction on what is going on.Overall, Underwater is a pretty fair film. It could be a lot worse. It turns out to be a worthy sci fi horror film that is worth watching if your into those kind of movies. It is fast paced with action, has a good cast ensemble, and puts you onto the edge of your seat.",Underwater
27,zkonedog,Great Idea But No Execution Of It,3,19 January 2020,"Deep sea explorations are something that have always fascinated me. We've gone to the moon and beyond, yet there are places deep below the ocean floor that have yet to be discovered, harboring any number of creatures not seen by human eyes. ""Underwater"" tries to play off that premise, but fails to execute it successfully in any really meaningful way.For a very basic overview, this movie focuses on a deep-water drilling station within the Marianas Trench. Ostensibly shadowing one worker, Norah (Kristin Stewart), it tells the story of how their drills tap into something that nearly wrecks the whole operation. With everything on the fritz and workers forced to ocean-walk from place to place, it quickly becomes clear they are being stalked by some sort of presence dredged up from the depths.First and foremost, ""Underwater"" could most easily be described as an ""Alien"" clone, swapping space for the ocean floor and Sigourney Weaver for Stewart (right down to the haircut and skimpy clothing, in all honesty). Unfortunately, while that concept was new and fresh in the 1970s, it doesn't work that way in 2020.So, what would have been needed to make this film solid was a great script, and there isn't even a speck of that here. Very clearly, this was the studio saying ""let's make an Alien clone, and we'll paste in the details as we go along"". It's both sad and disappointing, as there are indeed elements of interest present. Deep-water exploration is fascinating, drilling for resources at those depths could have been examined from a colonizing sort of perspective, and/or the psychological effects of spending so much time under the pressures of the sea. Sadly, none of those potential topics are provided anything more than lip service.As such, ""Underwater"" plays out more like a horror creature-feature. It is simply a group of people being chased around from point to point by a menacing figure that is finally revealed in the end. The design or technical specs of the monster is intriguing, to be sure, but when there is literally nothing else to care about it doesn't amount to much in the end.Overall, this is a very poorly conceived film and I can see why it is floundering at the box office. Not original enough to be scary, and not plot/character rich enough (by far) to be interesting in any other ways. A brutal combination. Only the concept will keep you watching whatsoever.",Underwater

The actors and effects are good, the end boss is a fine species (greetings from Lovecraft) but the story is more or less right out of the textbook of making a sci fi action movie. Anyway, if you want some solid produced stuff you may try Underwater, but like I stated recently in too many reviews and too many times regarding new movies these days: the story can't reach or hold the level of the production. Underwater: a solid flick but in my opinion a missed opportunity to make something really remarkable.Recommended if you like such movies like The Abyss, Deep Star Six, Leviathan, or their counterparts in space like Alien, Pandorum, Life etc.",Underwater

It's a strange type of mediocre. The film hits just the right marks but it does not get you excited just sparked enough to enjoy it.
Underwater moves too fast to be boring, which is good for this suspenseful film, but it also moves too fast to truly take notice of the cast of characters.
Some highlights of the cast are. Vincent Cassell, who was amazing as the station's captain. Makes we wish there was a new Star Trek or other science fiction series that needed a captain cause he would kill.
Another Highlight is TJ Miller. I'm surprise his name got on the poster cause I herd he was one of those guys in Hollywood that got canceled. The thing is, he is a supporting actor used for comedy relief and on this horror-like film, he did his job to perfection as the type of character who points out when they are in a horror cliche right on cue.
I should mention Kristan Stewart but I was not really impressed with her starring role because the advantage of being the star did nothing to improve her acting. Sorry, I'm just not impressed with anything she's done.

34,jtindahouse,"A very dark and tough to follow film, but it has its moments",6,5 February 2020,"As I was watching 'Underwater' I was thinking to myself that it was very strange that T.J. Miller was in the film, because I was sure that Hollywood had blacklisted him after his controversy. It wasn't until afterwards when I read that it had been filmed way back in 2017 that it made sense. Typically January is known as a month where the worst of the worst films get released. I don't think it would be fair to put 'Underwater' in that category though. It's far from perfect admittedly, but it does have its moments.This is an extremely dark film. Not dark in terms of tone, dark in terms of lighting. Now that might be considered fair when you factor in that the film is entirely set at the bottom of ocean, but it doesn't change the fact that it can make it difficult to watch at times. Combine that with the tight and claustrophobic way the film is shot and this can be a very laborious movie to follow. It's hard to get your bearing on exactly where everything is in relation to everything else a lot of the time. Then finally add in the fact that a lot of characters lines are quite hard to pick up, partly because of the suits the characters wear and partly because of mumbled delivery and accents on the actor's parts, and you have yourself a film that isn't the easiest to watch.The strength of the film lies in the suspense it is able to build. There are some very well crafted scenes in that respect. Also the pacing is lightning quick. After a quick opening credit sequence the film immediately kicks into the action and almost never relents. I wanted to like the creature side of things more, and I would say I didn't hate them, but they did feel slightly forced and out of place. It felt too much like the film was trying to be 'Alien', just ""underwater"", so to speak. This isn't must-see material but there is enough to keep you interested and entertained if you do decide to give it a shot.",Underwater

The movie also has Vincent Cassel, but he is wasted, and the attempt to inject unnecessary comic relief in the form of T.J. Miller is one of the movie's more obvious failings. Thus the other characters are distractions, particularly Miller.The creatures in the movie are totally forgettable - one cannot help but compare the movie with ""Alien"", where it can only come up short. The claustrophobic set design squeezed me out of the experience of watching the movie. It wasn't unsettling, it was tedious.

Miller-the Deadpool movies, Rock of Ages; Vincent Cassel-Jason Bourne, Eastern Promises and Jessica Henwick-Iron Fist_tv, Game of Thrones_tv.
This is an entertaining underwater creature feature. At the beginning of the movie, you get a quick synopsis of what has been going on. A research facility located about 7 miles below the surface of the ocean has a crew of about 300 people doing all kinds of researching. Primarily, they are drilling into the ocean floor and there are several different laboratories, several hundred feet apart. Kristen is in one of them when an earthquake hits and causes about 70% damage to the facility she is in. She looks for other survivors which include T.J., Vincent and Jessica and they decide that their best bet is to get to one of the other stations-the escape pods in their facility are damaged-and find a way to the surface. Their only option is to walk on the ocean floor-in pressurized oxygen suits, of course-but they soon find out that they are not alone in the water. It seems that the quake must have awaken some subterranean creatures and they don't like being awakened. Plus, Kristen and company are running low on oxygen in their suits. There is a message quickly glossed over about not being down there in the first place and doing things that they shouldn't be doing, like drilling, but it is quick. Like I said earlier, it is entertaining.

What more do you want...",6,3 November 2020,"I was expecting a horror but this is more of a survival thriller.That's perfectly fine though, it's the marketing that should be blamed and obviously having Kristen Stewart is always a plus.This movie starts out on the wrong foot for a several reasons: an overlong title sequence tries to set the scene at the expense of visual story telling and we also have unjustified narration. She mentions dreams and so I thought a lot of the first 5 minutes was indeed a dream. You won't now of course but it really made it hard for me to adjust to the movie and its pacing.This movie would have gained a lot from setting the scene more; giving us time to really take a look around this impressive set and really get even a small feel for the characters before things get crazy.I usually admire efficient story telling but the way this picture jumps in with both feet is just a little over whelming. It's not hard to understand but there is no moment to just let things sink in, no time to get my bearings and really follow this as a story and give it the emotional investment it obviously thinks it can get from us.The characters are nice and all but I feel that they were wasted here. They meet the quota of personality I want but we don't get so much.I suspect you can guess that these people are dealing with more than they think they are at the beginning. Let's just say that they are way too upfront in my opinion. The direction they go with in the third act...they should have just kept it simple because it feels like two movies glued together.So far I've been very negative but one must acknowledge the technical skill that went into making this, it's almost rather sad that so much talent and resources were dumped into this but it still shines through. The practical effects create a vivid aquatic world where the darkness presses in from all sides and the human and technophilic elements are impeccable. Nothing else is.I never thought of it as particularly progressive or not progressive but apparently different people had other opinions. Kristen is great and would have been great even if she wasn't in her under wear (pas mal). It's just a bonus. But that guy with the beard really steals the show.This clearly had a lot of ambition. They wanted an immersive, tense, poignant and funny tale of human survival with more than a few surprises and acting part of the larger literary tradition but it doesn't quite work, not because of the way they did it, but because of what they didn't do.I do not love the ending.I can't help but feel that ""Deadspace: Downfall"" is basically the same movie but done a ton better.

47,Pairic,Good Horror/SF,7,12 February 2020,"Underwater: Far better than some critics suggest if a tad derivative, this is a good Horror/SF film. Deep underwater there is constant pressure on those in Kepler Station, physical, mental and then that of 6.7 miles of water itself. As Norah (Kristen Stewart) is musing on life water drops on her head, then doors explode as a seemingly an earthquake strikes. She reaches safety along with others but at cost of sealing off some to die behind bulkheads. In the control room Captain Lucien (Vincent Cassel) informs them that all escape pods are gone, their only hope is to don pressure suits and walk through station corridors and along the seabed to possible safety at another facility.And so the trek begins, one fraught with danger of crashing elevators, jammed hatches, failing pressure suits. The inevitable happens as a suit is breached and an implosion occurs, resulting in terrifying gore. But there are also more exotic threats to be faced, strange creatures ranging from young Alien types to huge monsters of The Cthuhlu variety attack. Convincing in design these provide some good jump shocks. The corridors and control room/facilities do give a feel of the Alien films, especially the retro look of some of the instruments. Good acting from Stewart and Cassel along with the maintained tension of the underwater journey keeps the interest going. Not particularly original but Director William Eubank (working from a script by Brian Duffield and Adam Cozad) delivers an entertaining horror thriller. 7/0.",Underwater
48,andrewchristianjr,WATCHABLE.,7,21 October 2021,"Definitely a watchable movie. Very spookie at times.

Besides the usual choke points found in these wet climes (pressure, visibility, the need for oxygen), we have underwater creatures (released from the drilling) on the stalk. Running a brisk run time & knowing exactly where the story will be at any given second, the onus should've been on the director William Eubanks (he made an interesting film back in 2014 named The Signal which had a good look to it but also suffered from story in-cohesion) to tweak things by twisting expectations but we're never in doubt on how this monster mash will end.

And, uh, it's gonna blow us into tiny pieces to the surface.Am I a Kristen Stewart fan? On the contrary. To be honest, I seriously dislike this actress. Not that her acting is so terribly bad. And in a way, she's not a bad looking young woman either. But her attitude and facial expression don't really make her amiable. In the past I've already mentioned that her phlegmatic character equals that of a pancake and it seems as if her face was drenched in starch, because of her emotionless look. ""Personal Shopper"" and ""Equals"" were suitable films for this ""always-seriously-looking"" actress. Unfortunately, ""Personal Shopper"" was terribly boring and sleep-inducing. So, what convinced me to watch the movie ""Underwater""? No idea. Maybe because I heard this spectacle film was kind of a mixture of ""Alien"" and ""The Abyss"". In retrospect, this fact was also rather disappointing.You can compare ""Underwater"" with a classic dish served in an average brasserie. It smells good and tastes delicious, but it lacks the finesse of a star restaurant. You don't get excited. And you don't look disappointed at your empty plate, hoping that a waiter comes over and asks if you want an extra portion. The only feeling left is that of recognizability. Haven't we seen this before? And didn't it taste the same as the last time?I have to admit the film continues at a blistering pace. Before you realize it, the entire underwater drilling platform collapses and Norah (Kristen Stewart) must hurry through destroyed corridors and debris-filled compartments. A claustrophobic spectacle that takes place seven miles deep at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the deepest known spot in the ocean. At first glance, it appears to be an undersea earthquake that causes Norah and some survivors quickly have to figure out an escape scenario. But when they step along the ocean floor, in heavy, futuristic-looking wetsuits (""Pacific Rim"" inspired gear), it soon becomes clear that it's something else that's attacking them. Once again, it's humanity that pushed the boundaries. Like the speleologists in ""The Silence"", the drilling company most likely is the cause of unearthly creatures surfacing. In short, they have tapped into the wrong source while drilling for raw materials.I myself had that feeling of breathlessness while watching ""Underwater"". When you realize that this crew is surrounded by millions of tons of ocean water that presses on them with crushing force, you wouldn't want to trade places with them for any money in the world. A stumbling walk through pitch-black darkness, knowing that you could run out of oxygen anytime, your pressure suit could implode due to a construction fault or a strange underwater monster sucking the life out of you in a fraction of a second. I'd hyperventilate and show panicky behavior for less. ""Underwater"" is a suitable film for viewers who prefer to watch a movie that is packed with persistent action scenes. So preferably, no character development or a sophisticated storyline that's being built up in a subtle way. In short, for fans of fast food chains and fast microwave meals (Indeed, I am quite culinary-inspired today).Although you can admire a multitude of fantastic underwater footage (and making underwater images is no easy task), the fact it all takes place underwater (hence the film-title) is a disadvantage to the film. The images aren't really clear and most of the time blurred and hazy. Especially during the vigorous moments when the sea monsters play an important role. Thus, the moments when the crew experienced a life-threatening situation, the footage didn't have the desired impact most of the time. And that was the biggest turnoff for me. The lack of any tension. It's not a completely boring film, but there wasn't really nail-biting suspense. No astonishing plot twists or surprises. In addition, none of the actors really stood out. They were all uninteresting, two-dimensional characters, to say the least. I can't really call ""Underwater"" impressive. Even Kirsten Stewart's ultra-short bleached haircut didn't have the desired shock effect. And to be honest, it didn't help that she walked around half of the movie in her underwear. If they had chosen Scarlett Johansson instead, it would have made an impression. In that case, the three-dimensional aspect of the character Norah would come across much better! Significantly better!More reviews here: movie-freak.be",Underwater
53,aidanratesmovies,Nothing New Here,5,3 September 2020,"With potential flowing throughout, Underwater isn't sadly just a missed opportunity- but an incomplete and rather lazy film as well. I didn't mind the cast of this film, but felt angered that they had so little to work with. By far, the best actor in the film is Kristen Stewart, who totally puts her all into her performance- or at least as much as she can. The writing for the characters, and really in general, is so incredibly thin- it's as if they scrap noted an idea for each scene and decided to use it as the script. The film feels largely mechanical, as scenes tend to unfold in very predictable and formulaic measures. I did enjoy the look of the film, its underwater setting, and it's researching headquarters and suits provided- but something just felt like it was missing. A reason to care, maybe? A point, maybe? Largely I didn't care about what was going on in the film, and as it continued to go on, more and more scenes tended to feel rather abrupt and random- as if they had no idea what would come next as they were making it. The music in the film can be quite good, besides the horrible random Spongebob theme song cover, but all in all I did enjoy the score for what it was. It has moments of suspense, but nothing truly scare, or truly thrilling. If you are a huge fan of films like Alien than maybe I would recommend watching it, but most likely you would be disappointed. It does imitate it quite a bit, but I would put the film more similar in terms of Sony's 2017 flick Life instead. In the end, Underwater is a subtle and messy creature flick- with some to offer- but not much.
My Rating: 5.25/10",Underwater
54,I_Ailurophile,"Solid and entertaining, though too brisk and busy",8,10 October 2021,"Before the film even rightly begins, 'Underwater' has a lot going for it. There are some very recognizable, admirable names in the cast: Kristen Stewart, Vincent Cassel, Jessica Henwick, John Gallagher Jr., and more. While I'm unfamiliar with Brandon Roberts, fellow composer Marco Beltrami can always be relied upon to create fantastic film scores - and so it is here. And the opening credits are imparted to us over imagery of reports, news stories, abstracts, and diagrams that provide all necessary exposition in a few short minutes.The movie quickly impresses as being very direct - not in terms of being blunt and lacking subtlety, but to maintain a very quick pace, which I feel is honestly just fine for what is mostly immediately a tale of survival. That said, this directness does somewhat curtail the nuance of performance, or rounding details, that we might otherwise get, and it does feel a little rushed. 'Underwater' also comes across as a little ham-handed - not by way of being cheesy or over the top per se, but just in terms of requiring the suspension of disbelief that any sci-fi story does to engage with the material.I think it's very well made from a technical standpoint: sound design is impeccable, lighting adds a measure of atmosphere, and the set design and set pieces look great. Costume design, hair, makeup all look good, including blood and the visualization of wounds. The effects are swell, including exterior shots of the underwater facilities, and the what we see of the realization of fun creature design.I really like the cast, and they've all proven themselves elsewhere in the past. We do get to see the assembled actors demonstrate some of the range, poise, and nuance we know they're capable of. However, there's also no denying that they are restricted by the brisk pace of the feature, and the bounds of a genre picture that requires emphatic display of its constituent establishing elements over delicate presentation of artistic craft.And at length, I think those aspects that limit the cast also reflect what holds back the feature as a whole. The screenplay strikes me as marginally imperfect but solid - dialogue, characterizations, scenes, overall narrative. Still, in both the writing and direction, there's a substantial amount of plot crammed into these 95 minutes - many ideas, scenes, story beats. Even for as somewhat forcefully fast-paced 'Underwater' is, it struggles to include everything it wants to in a way that feels entirely organic. It's regrettable, because as much as I enjoy this, with slightly more careful consideration it could have been a truly great sci-fi horror flick.I admit I was predisposed to favor the picture in light of everyone involved, though I nonetheless began watching with mixed expectations - frankly, the it seemed like too perfect a conglomeration, made just for me. So I'm pleased that ultimately I really enjoy this: I think it's strong, complete, and tight in just about every regard. That it's a bit frenetic and overfull is unfortunate, and as is often the case, I also can't say I'm a fan of the unnecessary voiceover narration that opens and closes the feature. Yet putting these aside, I feel that 'Underwater' is an entertaining, satisfying movie mashing together a few different genres, and I would have no qualms about recommending it to just about anyone. As far as I'm concerned this is well worth watching if you have the opportunity.",Underwater
55,masonsaul,Great sci-fi horror,8,11 February 2020,"Despite it being derivative, Underwater is a great sci-fi horror that's tense, fast paced and extremely enjoyable.

56,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Interesting, but Flawed Creature Feature",6,26 January 2020,"This was a film that when I first heard about it intrigued me. I both love and am terrified of what could be at the bottom of the ocean. Seeing that this had what looked to be monsters as well ticked another box and I had vibes this could actually fall into Lovecraftian elements as well. The synopsis is a crew of aquatic researchers work to get to safety after an earthquake devastates their subterranean laboratory. But the crew has more than the ocean seabed to fear.We start this with newspapers filling us in with the back-story. The Tian Corporation has decided to drill at the bottom of the ocean to create energy. There are reports of seeing something that might be quite big and the reports are shot down by the company.It then takes us to Norah (Kristen Stewart). She's brushing her teeth and we get the feel of the place she's in. The lights don't seem to be reliable as they're close to 7 miles under the ocean, the deepest an operation like this has ever been. The place is then rocked by an earthquake. Norah makes it to a room where she is joined by Rodrigo (Mamoudou Athie), another worker that she knows of, but has never met. She is trying to shut a door to prevent the facility was destroying itself and has to kill two other co-workers as they won't make it in time. The two are knocked out though by place shifting.When they come to, they leave the room and look for a way out. This brings them to Paul (T.J. Miller), Captain (Vincent Cassel), Smith (John Gallagher Jr.) and Emily (Jessica Henwick). The plan Captain comes up with is to go to the ocean floor, walks across to where the drill is housed. This is something that's never been done before. They also encounter something that the world has never seen before either.Now I wanted to go a bit lighter on the recap here as there's not a lot to the story if I'm going to be perfectly honest. The goal is to survive, they don't have a lot of time and there could be something down there with them. This idea is what is really driving the tension as well. I do have to admit that I did get bored with this for a good stretch. It is odd as the runtime is normal and doesn't really outstay its welcome. I just think they focus on the wrong things.What I did like though was introducing the back-story as well as the epilogue through the newspaper headlines. This has been done before, but I think when you can use it, it is an interesting way to introduce information quickly without just flat out having characters tell us things. It hints as to what we can expect to happen here as well.Going along with that, I like the characters we get because of the job that they're doing down there. Norah is able to pretty easily fix computers, but she points out that she's a mechanical engineer so I buy that. Not everyone can do what she can, which makes that work even more. Everyone that is down there would be smart or really good at something as they wouldn't just send anyone down that far. When they know things about the science behind it, I don't really question it.As I was saying earlier, I did get bored a bit here. It doesn't waste any time getting into the crux of what destroys the facility they're in. I almost think that might work against the movie as I think part of my problem is that I really didn't care about anyone as they don't really get established. I'll delve more into this with the acting, but that's what I thought when I was walking home after leaving the theater. The tension never really builds from there either as well. I mean I did think about how they need to hurry before it is too late and then when see the creatures that add to it as well. It just feels too safe for whatever reason. We also get the set up for a sequel if they so decide. Seeing the box office briefly, that might not be the case.I know a lot of people probably won't see this or are ready to bash Stewart for her performance and I'll admit she isn't great. I do think she is fine though, especially since it can be explained by how smart she is. She did have a husband, but that doesn't mean she can't be cold like she is here. We do get to see her in bra for a good portion as well as her underwear if that interests you. Same goes for Henwick, who I did think was fine in her performance overall. She does show fear which is good. Miller tries to be funny, but it really didn't work that well here. Cassel shows signs he could be losing it, but it never goes anywhere. Gallagher I thought was really underutilized and the same could be said for Athie. I think the biggest problem here would be that we don't establish 'normal' for the characters. I think with that, we get more of an emotional impact to see them as they're trying to survive in my opinion.The effects were something that I was curious about as well. This does go pretty CGI heavy, but to be honest, I was fine with it. I believed that these people were inside of the facility that is at the bottom of the ocean and as it is falling apart. They're doing what they can to survive. The underwater scenes looked good as do some of the deaths we see. The creatures that I've alluded to are pretty much done in CGI, but again, I thought they looked real enough. I didn't really have any issues there. I'll have a brief spoiler section at the end that I want to delve into a couple things here as well. The cinematography was pretty solid as well.Now with that said, I thought that this movie did some good things, but just fell a bit flat for me. There are some believable parts to the story and it is a setting that makes me feel uncomfortable, with something I believe to be true about the bottom of the ocean. The movie though was boring until we get the climax and I think part of that is the lack of fleshing these characters out, especially with the ability of these actors. They went heavy with the CGI, but I didn't have issues with it. The murkiness of the water does help a lot there. The soundtrack didn't stand out aside from the use of alarms. They did make some scenes quite tense if I'm honest. Overall though I'd say this is slightly above average. I enjoyed the movie, but probably one I won't revisit unless I have to.My Rating: 6 out of 10SPOILERSWhat I wanted to talk about was first about the situation there in. The synopsis I'm assuming is to avoid spoilers, but the earthquake was actually this giant creature freeing itself. It is attracted to the light and is destroying this base of operations. What I really wanted to delve into though was my statement about this being Lovecraftian, because I originally thought that it was a Cthulu. After hearing Mr. Venom from the Fresh Cuts podcast, I actually think it is another elder god in Dagon. It has tentacles on its face and is a giant sea creature. I did like that it moves like a cave though having holes were they are smaller monsters living in that and then we see the tinier ones are similar to what comes out of people's chest in Alien. This movie pays a lot of homage to Alien and Aliens, but I don't find that to be an issue. That's what I wanted to point out here and would curious what others thought about this.",Underwater

Horrors and fears can take on many forms and in some cases the directors capture that terror in the perfect balance. On the other hand, the modern cinema also ruins the genre when cheap gimmicks fail to scare and become the focus. So what is tonight's film all about? Well Robbie K is here to offer some thoughts and insight as he makes spoiler free review of:
LIKES:The Decent Comedy

Suspense Moments

The Atmosphere
The Story Is OkayDISLIKES:The Predictability
T.J. Miller Forced Some Times
The Chaotic Camera Work at Times

The Worthlessness of Most Of the CrewSUMMARY:When it comes to a horror movie you can't help but want to laugh through the movie. Okay, I need to think of a better transition, but the film succeeds on throwing that comedic relief at just the right moments to help change the energy of the scene. That aside, the real strength of the movie comes in the cohesiveness of all the little parts that this genre thrives on when done right. First the acting! While not award winning, I was very happy to have characters that had more layers than the typical creature fodder Sci Fi Channel has made famous. Underwater's crew is different though, as Steward leads the bunch in a thrilling adventure that puts science skills to the test. Several members make logical decisions, there is great interaction amidst the crew, and the teamwork they show actually paints characters that are worth investing your time in. And through this adventure, let's just say there are a lot of things that will test your connection to them. This film moves quickly, a brisk pace that never dwells long enough for boredom, and takes few detours in the quest to escape the denizens of the deep. Mixing well with the pace comes very suspenseful moments that utilize so many special effects to paint the terrifying canvas of the deep in new ways that will insight nightmares. Some of the moments are all about the setting itself, while others integrate the creatures and allow the use of imagination to paint the terror. It works fantastically well, and when the revelation of the creatures finally arises, the design does not fail to impress. Monsters are made of nightmares like this, and they are utilized to a fine degree that does not overshadow the rest of the tale, but still gives you plenty of creature love. Yet what really ties everything for me is the atmosphere itself. Underwater uses its name well, and helps blend the adventure into sections that together form a cataclysmic environment. There are few safe havens in this movie, with the beasts lurking around every corner, and when they aren't the environment itself is ready to douse the life out of them. Throw in the use of shadows, fantastic sound editing, and again the tease with imagination that designs that environment. Finally, there is actually a point to all the chaos, with a logical connecting line that actually grants purpose to the antics at hand. Underwater takes the familiar story, and changes the acts to help keep the adventure fresh and dynamic.Amidst all the treasure, there are some rusted metals that tarnish the movie for this reviewer. For one the story is pretty predictable, still following most of the rules and trends that the SyFy channel movies do. A few twists do help stir the sediment up a bit, but you have an idea where it is going. Thankfully, this predictability is lessened due to the intensity of the scenes themselves. As mentioned above, there is comedic relief, and while enjoyable at times, there are other times where the awkward joke is too forced or beaten over the head for it to really work. This works in movies like Deadpool, and while I think it's curb to show how he is dealing with the stressful situation, there are times I would have liked to see a little more from this character other than another joke. These are probably minor dislikes for me, so I'll move on to a few of the things that were more bothersome for me. As many of you know, I'm not the biggest fan of chaotic camera work when it comes to details. While this added to the intensity of the scene, I felt Underwater went a little too crazy at times, using the swirling madness, and shadows a little too much to deprive the details I wanted to see. This aspect improved near the ending, but the middle parts had a hard time finding the balance between stable and maddening angles. Next, the suspension of disbelief sometimes is a little laughable for me in this film. I know, in this genre one must be ready to do this, but hear me out a little. Again with no spoilers, Underwater sort of does not play by its own rules it establishes at the beginning. The creatures behavior is erratic, sometimes being aggressive and other times not, which is sort of explained at the times, but then overwritten for me. Other times it's about how convenient things work out or don't work out, which though adds to the intensity of the scene, will in retrospective seem a bit cheesy at how things happen to play out. If this does not bother you or take away from the suspense, no worries then, but near the end in particular is where I particularly found them stretching their convenience muscles a little too far. Finally, though the movie is much better with crafting their characters than other creature features, it still has not quite put the finesse in everyone. For a crew of scientists, drillers, and deep-sea explorers, only one or two really show off the scientific skills that were promised. Kristen Stewart's character is the most equipped to handle the job and maybe the Captain, but the rest well, they don't quite hit the mark for epic battles.THE VERDICT:Overall, the creature feature is one of the best to emerge from the depths of the Hollywood ocean. Underwater takes us back to the days of classic film storytelling, where a story is designed to tether the scares, special effects of scenery and modern computer work add for decent scare factors, and the intensity of the sequences help net your interest in characters that aren't just shark fodder like a classic SyFy movie. While there are still some predictability issues, and the suspension of disbelief starts cooking up things, there are not too many issues that most fans of this genre will be affected. Again, I'm not particular fond of chaos swirling camera work, but I again admit it adds to the moments and at least gets balanced. Give all the CGI work, the decent story, and performances, this guy encourages you to head to the theater for this one to enjoy to the most, but if not definitely check it out at home.My scores are:Action/Drama/Horror: 7.5

60,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Underwater,5,13 January 2020,"""You're descending seven miles to the bottom of the ocean"". Sounds like a hoot. That's a quote from my first review of 2020 titled Underwater. Kristen Stewart stars in Underwater as the short-haired, athletic heroine named Norah Price. Aside from looking like a female Roy Batty, Kristen has screen presence and is embroiled in ""underwear"". Sadly, her line readings are a little garbled.Anyway, Underwater is draggy even with a running time of ninety-five minutes. Yup, it's not fully epic despite having shades of 2005's The Descent. In fact, Underwater resembles a lot of flicks such as Leviathan, The Abyss, DeepStar Six, Alien, Life, and (gulp) Event Horizon. Here's the problem: Underwater came after all that stuff so that deems it a little last-ditch. What a shame.Now has Hollywood run out of ideas in the regurgitated, sci-fi realm? Oh yeah. And is Underwater the outline of true life form leftovers? Almost.The director of Underwater is Massachusetts native and former HD technician, William Eubank. His vision of Underwater is murky cinematography, choppy editing (no pun intended), pouncing jump scares, not a whole lot of critter striking, and not a whole lot of character development.Underwater has virtually no buildup as we the audience watch the film from perhaps the middle or second act. Besides some cringe-worthy comic relief from goofball (and Hudson wannabe) T.J. Miller, the personas are virtually non-indelible. They are slack passengers just waiting for the parasitic slaughter.Distributed by 20th Century Fox and containing a decent musical score by Marco Beltrami (Free Solo, A Quiet Place), Underwater is about heinously morphed creatures who terrorize some research crew members far below the surface of the Pacific Ocean.Look for a backhanded ending (which I liked) and some science fiction dialogue that reeks of vessel deja vu (that I didn't like). Underwater was released in January and was shot almost three years ago. That's some bad cinematic juju if you ask me. Rating: 2 stars.",Underwater
61,rannynm,Thrilling adventure with lots of jump scares,10,11 January 2020,"I like this movie because it is a very thrilling film. It's a mix of drama, comedy and horror. The whole film is filled with jump scares and excitement that kept me on the edge of my seat. Underwater is a 95 minute long movie.This movie is about a drilling crew that lives in a facility all the way down in the Mariana Trench, which is located in the western Pacific Ocean. The Mariana Trench is one of the deepest part of the ocean, basically like the Grand Canyon but in the ocean. Suddenly the facility suffers a type of earthquake, which the crew thinks has happened. Six survivors go through a difficult journey in order to get to the life pods and survive the catastrophe. It happens that it was not an earthquake that destroyed the facility, it is a kind of sea creature that is too big and powerful for them to defeat.My favorite part of Underwater is when the crew discovers a new life form. It takes the crew and the audience by surprise. The costumes are very creative. They look like a heavy type of astronaut suit. The graphics are incredible. The underwater scenes look very realistic. A few scenes are too dark to figure out what is going on. There is fowl language, blood and gore - perfect for horror fans. The acting is perfect, especially Kristen Stewart (Nora) who keeps the audience in suspense. Vincent Cassel (the Captain) and T. J. Miller (crew member) are spectacular too.The moral of this story is to know our limits and respect other living beings' habitats. Humans are very curious to know more or learn more, to the point that we cross the line and trespass other living beings' homes. It's good to have more knowledge, but it is also good to know our limits.I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to ages 12 to 18, plus older adults. People with bad hearts or epilepsy should not watch this movie.Reviewed by Ethan P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by tweens and teens, go to kidsfirst dot org.",Underwater
62,Kamurai25,"""Wet, Wild, and Perilious""",8,1 January 2021,"Great watch, will watch again, and do recommend.To be fair, I was sick when I saw this was available and couldn't resist watching it.I'm a fan of Kristen Stewart (most of the time), and sure, she runs around in her underwear for a lot of the movie, but that's not a reason to watch the movie, it's a horrible reason for a web search.A great reason to watch this is that it is a underwater survival story. The isolation and technical strategy involved in dealing with this situation makes it gravely atmospheric, without the threat of ""monsters"". Honestly, that version would have also made a great movie.The movie clearly takes queues from several other great movies, and while it does it very well, the problem there is ""several"". Had the movie mirrored only ""Alien"", it probably would had been a stronger story. Clearly the writers wanted the threat to build, similar to video games, or possibly more similar to an alien invasion movie.The cross between a survival / slasher movie and an invasion movie muddles the feel of the movie somewhat. It downgrades the movie from truly excellent to great, and I don't feel that everyone is going to get the proper experience to recognize all of the great individual parts because the overall pie tastes a little funny.",Underwater
63,justin-fencsak,It's the Abyss meets Alien,6,26 September 2020,Kristen Stewart plays the heroine in this moderate budgeted film that takes place underwater during a massive weird earthquake that is devouring the world she and her friends live in.

65,vengeance20,Underwater lacks serious Depth,4,19 February 2020,"Just back from seeing this tonight & felt the film could've been far greater after seeing a last chance screening.The film follows a group of engineers trapped in an underwater facility 7 miles below the sea after something attacks them. They then must find a way back to the surface before the facility explodes & kills them all.I found the film to be random, primarily because it lacked depth & explanation. Like why was the creature attacking them in the first place? What were the engineers doing in the first place, never mind who the engineers were themselves. There was no kind of ""point"" or ""reason"" behind it, at all. I will however give it to the filmmakers, the film did literally throw you into the action & didn't waste any time in doing so, but honestly I would've liked a proper introduction, backstory & some character development.The camerawork was too close up to make out where the characters were, never mind what rooms(s), sections or locations around the facility they were in. Up, down, left, right where? It was pretty disorientating & annoying. The lighting also didn't help with this & only added to the camerawork issue. Furthermore, the creature itself fell victim to the 2 above issues, camerawork & lighting, you could barely get an idea of what the creature looked like, never mind how big it was or what it was for that matter. Even when you did see the creature it was a bit too alien like for an underwater creature.While the deaths were bloody, they were pretty boring & naff. While the suspense was good, the payoffs weren't all that. However, the dark sinister mood & little bit of eye candy for us lads was something. The ending wasn't too bad, but as I said at the start the point of the film was lost & the why could've been easily addressed. The pacing was a little off too.Overall, an ok horror, sci-fi film that could do with a substantial amount of improvement. The film felt too random, pointless, bland due to the lacking in depth & backstory which could've saved this one, that & a few unique, cool & bloody deaths could've made this film way better than it actually was. 4/10",Underwater

68,arungeorge13,Nothing new in the plot; impressive production design & cinematography though. [+52%],5,20 October 2020,"Underwater is an amalgamation of various creature-feature flicks with little novelty in plot and setting. The cast (barring T J Miller, who slept off on the Deadpool sets and woke up as a supporting character in this movie) is adequate: the likes of Kristen Stewart, Vincent Cassel, Mamoudou Athie, John Gallagher Jr, and Jessica Henwick play key roles. An earthquake destroys part of an underground drilling facility and its resident employees Norah (Stewart), Rodrigo (Athie), Paul (Miller) are forced to flee. They find Captain Lucien (Cassel), Emily (Henwick), and Smith (Gallagher Jr.), and decide to walk a mile across to Roebuck 641 to attempt resurfacing from there.T J Miller jokes around a little too much in a film with an otherwise serious tone. It's obvious that he's having fun being part of a (creature) horror film but showing some restraint would have helped here. A not-bad recent example would be Danny McBride in Alien: Covenant. In terms of character development, you get very little except for a scene that arrives quite late into the film. The creature effects are standard CGI fare. Some scenes look more effectively crafted than others. Bojan Bazelli's cinematography, in fact, elevates the film several notches. A couple of slow-motion scenes were visually brilliant.The plot doesn't have many surprises up its sleeve. The manner in which it unfolds doesn't make the average sci-fi fanatic go ""wow"". This is basically the film's undoing - it lacks that much-needed X factor. A few jumpscares (even underwater) cannot make up for that.",Underwater

70,martimusross,An Underwater Horror Similar To Alien,6,12 February 2020,"UnderwaterI enjoyed this movie but it's not everyone's cup of tea. We had a simple linear jump scare movie set in an underwater mining base. Much was reminiscent of Alien just set under water.What was goodA great tense atmosphere we were straight into the action. There was a great feeling of being trapped and my claustrophobia was jangling 10 minutes in..... ahhKristen Stuart was good in delivering a clunky script, she made this work and the camera loves her look.Great underwater special effects it really was quite gripping.What was not so goodI thought it was an over simplistic plot, no back story on the ""creatures"", no proper character development.The horror was limited to ""jump/scare"".Lack of variety in the situations.The survivors were the ""duds"" of the group....lolOverall it was good but with some minor tweaking could have been so much better.",Underwater
71,rivertam26,Pleasant surprise,9,10 January 2020,"What a pleasant surprise especially in January. Kristen Stewart stars as a young woman living seven miles beneath the surface on a drilling station that ends up unearthing some terrifying creatures. The movie starts off with a bang as the station she's in begins to implode. Immediately it's a race against time as she hooks up with other survivors and the captain devises a plan that will have them walking across the dark ocean floor where they're not alone. With a rich, dark and sometimes intentionally muddled cinematography you are introduced to a spacious, endless world filled with floating debris that feels both wide and frighteningly claustrophobic. Funny guy TJ Miller, the awesome Vincent Cassel and cutie John Gallagher Jr. fill out some of the other supporting roles. Theres not a lot of setup but director William Eubank of the Signal establishes an intense, edge of your seat atmosphere accompanied by stylish cinematography and a mounting sense of dread. The movie is fun and is filled with homages to Alien and lovecraft all the while creating something new of it's own. The culmination of events left me wanting just a tiny bit more but I loved the retro feel as well as throwing itself so wholeheartedly into being an aquatic horror enormous sized creature feature. Although the story and characters aren't developed as well as you would hope the situational genre entry is anchored by a strong bad ass and against type lead performance from Kristen Stewart. This is one I'll definitely be seeing again in theaters.",Underwater

I liked how they quickly set up the plot in no time and kept it action-packed to the core. For not a second was the film out of intensity, and a powerful performance coming from Kristen Stewart only made it more fun to watch.Underwater does have its share of jump-scares, but they genuinely work. At least for me, they did. The visual effects were pretty good for a film that's meant to be darkly lit for the major duration. The action sequences were impressive, and it's good to see Kristen Stewart in action movies. The film is crisply edited and manages to pack action, drama, horror and suspense without going overboard.Trust me, if you're just looking for an entertaining sci-fi action horror film, it won't disappoint you.",Underwater

The giant monster with its small 'soldiers' were impressive and I'd like to see them more. It felt really claustrophobic with very tight spaces and tight suits with very dimly lit spaces which makes a lot of sense as we're at the floor of the Mariana Trench. They went down to the base with an elevator and walked like they're walking on the moon at a depth of around 10 km which was a bit ridiculous I assume. There were there pods one of which was broken and our protagonist sacrificed herself and the ending was very unexpected for me because I thought our main character would make it no matter what but she didn't. She imploded the core and perished along with the gigantic animal and the small ones.",Underwater

This is major fault of the movie as me. Moreover director also confused about what to present on scree either deep water accident horror or under sea creatures' horror. That makes nothing part be impressive and movie looks like average, though they have a lot of hardwork and difficulties to make such underwater shooting.

You have a tense, action filled little hour and a half of the world of the underwater and all its surprises and wonders. Add earthquakes, trench movements and some unknown previous undiscovered life-form out there and you have covered the price of admission. There are parts you can critique but I noticed I was gripping the arm rests and had some jump or heavy focus moments that drown (pun) out any take-aways. The actors covered it and the sets impressive as to be realistic. As to the life-form itself, hey anything that has to put up with pressures, cold water, predator activity and lots of Acts of nature and intrusions by mankind has to be in itself one bad entity for endurance or survival sake. Think survival of the fittest. Everything alive today represents the strongest and best of its kind as a rule. No exceptions here.

It should be fine as long as the waters aren't filled with some nasty monsters released by the drilling.
whoops!The action is immediate and hard hitting and thrilling.This has all the elements you can imagine, people getting stuck under things, oxygen running out, rooms filling with water, sea creatures mauling people etc.
The effects are great, the monsters interesting and it is all done quite well.""Quite well"" is the problem.
This film looks like it is going to be amazing and it is hard not to get excited about it.
So when it takes a paddle around lake-mediocrity it feels really, really bad.The characters are stark and relatable but you get no build up so you are always playing catch up with them and the relationships between them were a little unclear.
Kristen Stewart's character has a sub plot that should be really meaningful but just feels tacked on as it is relayed through the mediums of chitchat and locker junk.You get no feel of where the survivors are going so a lot of the plot relies on aptly placed road signs and a patronising version of Alexa, who is zero help to the crew, until it needs to explain how the film is going to end - which it does in patronising detail even drawing us a little picture.This is a pretty good disaster/monster flick but it feels like a lot of potential has been wasted - which makes me think less of this film than I should.The production and performances are all good.
Kristen Stewart is very good, but maybe she is stereotyped in my eyes as it took me twenty minutes to shake the feeling that she was on her way to a Halloween party dressed as ""the real slim shady"" when this all kicked off.A good enough movie but with a tiny bit more work and a little more nerve this would have easily been an absolute classic people were talking about for the next fifty years.",Underwater
79,petra_ste,Serviceable horror,6,11 February 2020,"I've seen this compared to Aliens but it's actually closer to the first Alien, more focused on atmosphere and build-up of dread than on action. Not that Underwater comes even close to Ridley Scott's masterpiece, but it's a competent effort by director William Eubank, whose previous film, The Signal, was well-shot but poorly-written. Eubank wisely sticks to direction only here and does a solid job.After a disaster in an underwater station in the depths of the Mariana Trench, six survivors attempt to return to the surface. As if the situation was not bad enough, with the reactor overheating and oxygen running out, mysterious sea creatures begin to stalk them. There is a sort-of twist in the last act which I won't spoil but fellow Lovecraft fans may appreciate.I do wish the movie had taken its time at the beginning and had the confidence to start slower, introducing the characters, the setting and the first unsettling signs of something wrong (say, sighting strange creatures BEFORE the catastrophe). Instead, two minutes after the opening credits the whole station blows up. It feels rushed; it's like Alien starting with the facehugger, a big miscalculation in terms of dramatic structure. The ""foreplay"" is what makes the scary parts resonate. Oddly enough, it's the opposite problem of The Signal, which had a decent build-up but fell apart around the midpoint.Still, the middle part of Underwater is, to its credit, quite unnerving. Not the kind of film which redefines horror but a fair choice if you enjoy the genre.6,5/10",Underwater

83,bob-the-movie-man,Soggy and Forgettable,4,21 February 2020,"I had a sinking feeling (excuse the pun) about this movie from the word go. It's a lazy approach to 'mansplain' the whole set up for the movie through digital news posts during the main titles. It feels more patronising to the audience than having main titles and then a 'Star Wars-style' synopsis.Once into the movie, director William Eubank gives us the bare minimum of character set-up for our heroine while she brushes her teeth*. (And no way did she even follow the British Dental Association recommendation of two minutes brushing!) (* Interestingly, the trailer seems to show some above water scenes/dialogue and introductions to the rest of the crew that never made the final cut.)And then....BAM!!!I was thinking that the manic action that follows was some sort of dream or flashback. But no. We are pitched headlong into the story without pause as disaster strikes. It all feels positively indecent.For we are seven miles down in the Mariana trench, when a drilling station springs a leak.Now call me a cynic, but I would have *thought* that, at that depth, a single leak would implode the whole station in about 10 seconds flat. But then that wouldn't be cinematic enough, and would be a much shorter movie!And there are numerous other scientific implausibilities. For example, diving helmets that appear to be able to withstand 15,750 psi of pressure (I Googled it) can be smashed-in by a woman by just bashing it.Sigh.We are in 'Alien-lite' territory again. Just as in last year's ""The Meg"", those pesky humans have disturbed something in its home territory.... and it's suitably pissed-off. The action centres on hippy-chick engineer Norah (Kristen Stewart). The script neatly describes her as a ""flat-chested elfin creature""... a fact which every male in the audience has thought (come on guys, admit it , you did!) from the immediately preceding scene.It was never entirely clear to me what skills Norah was supposed to have.... it seemed to flex from diving to electrical engineering to computer engineering.Stewart is a handy actress to have in a movie, but here she is mostly relegated to lots of shots of her athletic body running through corridors in her skimpy crop-top and knickers.Supporting Stewart are veteran French actor Vincent Cassel as the mission captain; ""the funny one"" Paul (T.J. Miller); the trusty male action figure Smith (John Gallagher Jr.); and Emily - the 'less-flat chested but screamy one' (Jessica Henwick). Emily also gets to run around in a T-shirt and knickers: you kind of quickly get to know the audience the film is trying to appeal to.As will be obvious if you've seen any of these types of film before, not all of these folks are going to make it.As this movie is presumably filmed in a small water tank in a Louisiana studio. Clearly the memo said ""fill it with murky water so the audience can't see the sides"". ""And just for good measure, let's film it with hand-help rapidly moving cameras"". The result is that a lot of the time, when there was a burst of frenetic underwater action, I had NO IDEA what was actually going on.In this way, the movie reminded me of the shark B-movie ""47 Metres Down"" from a few years ago.This is certainly not ""Alien"". Although similarly set, this is not ""The Abyss"" either. It's most similar perhaps to ""Life"", but without the clever twist ending.It's also not a truly TERRIBLE movie either. But unfortunately this is one of the most ""meh"" action movies I've seen in the past year. It's just brain-crushingly forgettable.There was only one vaguely memorable shot in the whole movie: a final shot of Kristen Stewart. But that just serves to make me think.... 'Stewart deserves much better than this'.For a movie concerning itself with a lack of oxygen, watching this felt like a waste of it.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

84,pietclausen,"Looked Interesting, but . . .",3,22 August 2020,An undersea sci-fi horror drama going nowhere. Explosions galore leaving a few people to fight another day.

You may get a fright once in this film but that's the only highlight.,Underwater
85,kjproulx,A Surprisingly Fun Thriller,7,17 April 2020,"Colour me surprised. Everything from the trailers to the posters for Underwater made it seem like a rehash of a thousand better survival films, and while it absolutely has a few cringe-worthy moments and it not afraid to completely steal ideas from other films, it's actually quite a solid little thriller. My expectations were incredibly low, as I was expecting to hate how derivative it would feel, but I never really did. I'm shocked to say this, but here's why I believe Underwater (especially if you're a fan of survival movies) is probably worth your time.The premise is simple. A mysterious occurrence ruptures a submarine underwater, causing many of the crew members to parish. The few survivors left, band together in order to come up with an escape mission. This movie could've benefitted from much more development of its characters and a little more time to spend with these characters before the event itself, but the filmmakers clearly just wanted to place you in a survival story right off the bat. Once you get past the rushed feel of the first act, this movie becomes very enjoyable.The main character in Norah is played by Kristen Stewart, which was something else I was apprehensive of before viewing. Not that I think she's a bad actress, but she's never exactly blown me away in any of her roles. I think her performance in Underwater is probably the best she's ever been. Not only does she deliver something different than she ever has, but she almost feels like someone who would actually have a job like this. Where this movie suffers, however, is through the events of the third act.While it becomes obvious that the third act will be a giant spectacle as the film progresses, I wasn't expecting it to go as far as it did. It almost felt like the conclusion to a different movie. Underwater begins as a film that pays homage to the first Alien film but becomes a generic CGI-fest by the end. Still, the effects themselves were actually quite good and I was invested enough to not let it hurt the movie too bad. Aside from an overblown ending and a rushed start, this movie hit all the right marks for me.In the end, Underwater certainly won't be winning any awards, but it's a fun little creature-feature nonetheless. Kristen Stewart is solid in the lead role and supporting performances from Jessica Henwick and Vincent Cassel stood out to me as well. T.J. Miller is present as the comedic relief, which honestly just felt unnecessary, but there's a lot more good than bad here. If you're looking for a quick little thriller to watch, there are much worse options. Underwater was a pleasant surprise.",Underwater
86,kuarinofu,Scriptless moviemaking everybody,4,12 January 2020,"It's up to you whether you want to go see it or not, but I can tell you one thing - Underwater is not a good film and you will most likely not enjoy it.I got used to the fact that sci-fi is not the domain of nerds any more. Everybody can write whatever stuff and think that they are writing good and intelligent sci-fi. So let's get this straight out of the way - in case of Underwater we are not talking about suspension of disbelief, it's utterly ripped from reality. They don't even bother with technicalities and this makes this film harder to watch.The biggest undermining factor is the script. The premise is there, and it is somewhat plausible. I mean, you can switch off some parts of your brain to enjoy this, but they just won't let you. All the establishment you get is some text explanation in the beginning, then you're done. The pacing is insane, you just get thrown into the movie. Be sure not to blink and no bathroom breaks cause you'll miss a lot. I missed the trailers, and I walked in during the starting credits, so when the movie jumped on me it felt like I missed half of the film. It does not mess around.Imagine having Vincent Cassel in your film and give him absolutely no character? He literally has nothing to do. Oh wait, there are no characters in this at all. We have some token character types (the panicker, the joker, the plot device) but not that many and they are only revealed through ""hey, you're the guy who..."" or other random amateur sceenwriting explanatory monologues (these really get ridiculous at times). All the dialogues are horrendous. I also love how T. J. Miller's character casually laughs that he can use the credit card of a dead person they found underwater when they find his wallet WITH HIS FAMILY PICTURE, yeah, horrible death is funny.The story doesn't make sense and is full of holes, I don't want to waste time to talk about all of these just cause there's a lot.If you're still willing to watch this be sure to prepare yourself and stay concentrated since it's nearly impossible to tell what is going on half of the time. It's very murky, which was probably intentional, but half of the time you are not sure what is supposed to be happening to whom. In my country we have only dubbed foreign films and the voices were kinda similar so it was even worse in my case. Sometimes I was unable to tell who was alive and who was dead at that moment. This was very confusing for a film that literally has no script or characters.By the end it gets so stupid I couldn't stop laughing. It was unable to reach even the Prometheus' level of stupidity in terms of character actions (and the Prometheus' characters were pretty stupid already).I really want to say something positive about this film, so I guess I can say that the production design was good (even though the creature design made no sense in terms of how underwater fauna would naturally look like).Other than that, Kristen Stewart was great to look at (and they spend a lot of time showing her) and this is pretty much it.What sucks is that I've seen William Eubank's other films, he had some good low-budget science fiction (like The Signal, which was very ok).I actually found myself rushing out of the theater when this was over. Never was I so fast to get away from a bad film, thanks, Underwater.",Underwater

But, I wasn't disappointed to discover I was wrong. The character, Nora, is actually played by Kristen Stewart, who is no stranger to what my father would call ""weirdo roles."" As anyone else who's followed her career from her film debut in THE CRAFT through the TV series THE MENTALIST can vouch for!That's the first pro. The first con is that she's the only recognizably big name in the cast. The rest of them, I've never head of.The second pro is that this movie has one genuinely startling moment that made me literally jump in my seat. And other moments that merely made me cover my eyes in suspenseful anticipation. The second con is that I've seen those types of moments before. In ALIENS, DEEPSTAR SIX, and any recent remake of KING KONG or GODZILLA you care to name.In short? The movie is an enjoyable time-killer. But, there's a reason the trailers for it have been few and far between. Most fans of this type of eco-horror/sci-fi/disaster flick will have seen this type of action already and probably dismiss it as not worth their hard-earned money.But, I have no _major_ complaints with it.

They should've delete the last monster scene and add first 20min+, I felt that what this movie lacked the most, was a purpose. Sure ""survival"" is a purpose, but who are these people? What were they really mining for? What were the creatures? Why did they do what they did? The ending hints at some possible sinister connections, but since this isn't meant to have any sequels (and certainly won't be profitable enough to warrant any), we won't get any further information.

90,Darkside-Reviewer,Good Effort Worth Watching,6,9 April 2020,"I will start off by saying I am not a fan of Kristen Stewart and any of her previous movies but honestly in the case of Underwater she's 100% the best part of the movie from start to finish she surprised me with her acting showing that put in the right role she is more than capable of being a lead character in a movie and that she has matured as an actress in this role she is serious, dedicated and looks hot as all hell in a bikini.The movie is a creature feature/survival movie that takes place on a seven mile deep mining rig that is drilling the ocean floor but when the rig is hit by an unknown source the pressure causes most of the rig to explode with only a small group of survivors who now have no way of reaching the surface their only hope is to suit up and walk the pitch black ocean floor to make it to another mining station with escape pods that can get them to the surface but once on the ocean floor they discover new life in the oceans depths awoken by the mining drills now with creature's all around them and oxygen running low it's a race against time to make it to the surface alive.The underwater shots look amazing and capture the dark murky waters of the oceans depths the creature's are actually pretty interesting looking and have a lot of interesting design ideas some aspects are inspired from other creature features such as Cloverfield there's no denying that but you can see some real imagination and effort was put into the movie and that's worth acknowledgement.I went into this movie expecting another disappointing January horror movie but Underwater took me by surprise which is more than most movies have managed to do in the past few years so if you like creature feature movies then you will enjoy this but I would also recommend this movie to people who enjoy survival movies as the creature's aren't the only thing the characters are trying to survive against they also must brave a flooded mining rig in very tight underwater spaces and are trapped inside steel suits meant for Underwater exploration with little oxygen in the suits that also weigh 300 pounds with glass helmets makes you feel claustrophobic just watching.",Underwater

92,msbreviews,Underwater is far better than January movies and it's surprisingly well-made!,7,15 April 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I was surprisingly interested in and even optimistic about this movie. Why ""surprisingly""? Well, first of all, the cast doesn't really have a big name attached to it even though I actually enjoy some of Kristen Stewart's performances (who, like Robert Pattinson, has a few blind haters that haven't seen anything else other than Twilight), as well as a few other actors (Jessica Henwick, particularly). Then, no director or screenwriter caught my attention. William Eubank hasn't done anything exceptional yet. Brian Duffield co-wrote Insurgent (awful) but delivered a surprisingly fun horror screenplay with The Babysitter. Finally, Adam Cozad helped to create some underwhelming narratives (The Legend of Tarzan, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit).In addition to this, I'm not in favor of films written by more than two people since these usually disappoint, and... it's a January movie. So, why was I slightly excited to watch Underwater? For the same reason a lot of people probably avoided it: its formulaic horror-thriller story deep at the bottom of the ocean. If a sci-fi film has a premise based on a team that works on a claustrophobic location and some sort of entity ""disrupts"" their job, I'm instantly drawn into these movies. There's something about them that makes me enjoy them more than most people. Usually, this type of film has a low-budget and really requires a talented director who's able to generate genuine tension and suspense.Underwater is 2020's big surprise. January movies are known to be Hollywood's trash bin, so I'm honestly dumbfounded that this film is far from being bad. It's very, very good! The set and production design are impressive, and they help create that isolated, suspenseful atmosphere. The first few minutes are nail-biting. The next twenty minutes are fantastic. The following twenty minutes continue to be a blast of entertainment. I felt continuously surprised by how good the movie actually is. I still can't believe what I just witnessed!Don't twist my words, it's not a masterpiece or even a ""great"" film. It still follows a plot-driven narrative that countless other movies did better. It borrows inspiration from Alien, Cloverfield, 20000 Leagues Under the Sea, and every other film involving an alien-like form threatening a crew. Plus, it lacks characterization of pretty much every character. There's no real attempt at deeply developing a single character to make the audience care about it, but this doesn't mean the movie can't succeed. Like I wrote above, there's a whole lot of plot-driven films that went on to be phenomenal.The difference between those and Underwater is that the latter doesn't truly bring anything new to the genre. It just uses the known cliches and executes them really well, which is itself a massive surprise. I can't deny that I had a lot of fun watching this thriller. I expected messy action with way too dark lighting making it impossible to see anything. I received surprisingly visible, well-filmed sequences, packed with tension, tons of panic, and a palpable sense of urgency. There aren't that many moments to breathe and relax.The VFX team and Bojan Bazelli (cinematographer) deserve a lot of credit because the ""aliens"" not only are visually captivating, but they are shown just in the right spots for the exact right amount of time. Underwater doesn't possess a huge budget, so the creatures need to be shown ""in the shadows"" to make them look and feel ""realistic"". It might seem like an obvious technical decision to be made, but its execution it's far from being an easy task, so kudos to everyone that participated in making the monsters a genuinely menacing threat.The cast is excellent. Kristen Stewart continues to break out of the Twilight shell, proving again and again that she's a wonderful actress. Jessica Henwick is pretty great, as well as Vincent Cassel. Everyone delivers fairly decent performances, even T.J. Miller, who portrays the always divisive comic-relief character that will surely be extremely annoying to some, and quite funny to others (I stand in the middle, I think his character is fine).It's definitely a good sci-fi horror-thriller, way better than most January flicks (Underwater is one of the last 20th Century Fox's movies, which probably means that Disney had no clue what to do with it, hence dumping it in the worst month of the year). I just added William Eubank to my list of directors to follow. His commitment to actually make a good film is demonstrated on screen, so I really hope that his movie gains some sort of following when it reaches people's homes.Underwater is 2020's (first) massively positive surprise. A January film far better than most of the month's competition. William Eubank delivers a remarkably well-filmed sci-fi horror-thriller filled with great tension, surprisingly visible (!) action, fantastic production design, and some really captivating VFX work. It's by no means a brilliant movie! It takes inspiration from better films of the same genre, and it follows a straightforward, plot-driven narrative with close to zero character development. It simply uses the known cliches but executes them really well. An underrated cast led by Kristen Stewart offers some notable performances, but it's the claustrophobic atmosphere surrounded by incredibly well-generated suspense that turns this movie into a success. Technically, I still can't believe how surprised I am. I just wish that it had a little bit of more characterization, so I could recommend it even more. As it stands, do watch it at the highest quality when you get the chance.Rating: B",Underwater

96,SoumikBanerjee25,Should have been a lot better!,4,16 May 2020,"This one is awkard I must say. The film starts without any proper context and then jumps right away into the action. For lot of you that might be thrilling enough but for me personally; that wasn't something I can acknowledge from my heart.A Sci Fi thriller/horror must have a well built pretext. You can't just start the story right away. And also the Pacing is too fast. It's weird that most of the times I complain about Pacing issues in a film. I usually applaud those who has shorter runtimes but unlike here. The film had gone too abruptly. The characterization is next to nothing. I couldn't connect to any of those. Kristen Stewart, she is a talented actress no doubt but even with her eye catching portrayal here. This film hadn't gone anywhere. The most frustrating thing is how little it provided in terms of Backstory, Depth in the characters and Any sort of explanations about what the heck was going on.It seemed like a simultaneous sequence of random events that occur because of a supposed attack on the underground facility. And that's just about it. Why they were there? What is the actual purpose of them being there? What are those things that are attacking them and why! This movie aroused more questions than answers unfortunately. And that I can not bear to be honest.In a Sci Fi flick, you must show us some sort of Explanation, Clarity on the main concept you are showing. But the overkill editing here looked like they were in a hurry. The Cinematography as well wasn't fully flawless. Some scenes practically looked shallow and too tight for my liking. Sound score was generally good with some Nice effects here and there. That surely helps to build up the tension. And to a certain extent it succeeds too. But Sometimes in order to pump up the drama or any scare element they brighten up the tones and to be frank it sounded awkard on few of those specific occasions.The honest applause must go to the CGI and Art Direction department. They had done an excellent job. No doubt about that. And maybe a bit to Kristen as she done a good job as well. The asthetics of the film too kinda saved it in my humblest opinion. An Incomplete final product that seriously could have been better",Underwater

Miller, I don't think he should be given work by hollywood anymore... Just look at the guy's past as it's filled with ungentlemanly behavior which I myself wouldn't want to be associated with).The entire movie is a B-rated monster-thriller with some action sprinkled over the top. It's sub-average and with this budget (and a different director), it could have been made into a much better B-rated movie, something more similar to Deep Blue Sea (1999), which is actually a pretty good monster-thriller.",Underwater

99,MrDHWong,"Rehashes virtually every cliche of both its genres to such an extent that it begs the question ""why bother at all?""",4,11 June 2020,"Underwater is a sci-fi horror film directed William Eubank (The Signal, Love). Starring Kristen Stewart in the lead role, it rehashes virtually every cliche of both its genres to such an extent that it begs the question ""why bother at all?""Deep beneath the ocean at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the underwater drilling rig Kepler 822 is hit by a massive earthquake, destroying most of the structure and leaving its remaining crew stranded. Trying to reach the safety of a neighbouring rig over a mile away, mechanical engineer Norah Price (Kristen Stewart) leads a small collective of survivors across the treacherous ocean floor while wearing special pressurised suits. Unbeknownst to the crew, the earthquake was caused by a group of previously undiscovered creatures that are now in the process of stalking and picking them off one by one.If the basic premise above sounds familiar to you, then that's because it is. ""Underwater"" shamelessly steals ideas and plot points from better, more entertaining films like Alien(s) and The Abyss, trying to pass them off as something new with the assumption that the audience should be admiring the filmmakers for this. Of course, it isn't uncommon for films to take influence or respectfully borrow from other sources but there needs to be a sense of nuance for that to work properly. This film doesn't so much use its influences wisely as much as rip them off entirely. While watching, I often found myself checking off the typical tropes one should expect in a movie like this - the tough female lead, the token friend who's only there to be killed off later on, the enigmatic monsters who want nothing more than to prey on the heroes, the overly complicated scientific jargon, the malfunctioning equipment at crucial times... I could go on but I think you get the idea.The film's biggest faults, however, are its poor character development and unnecessarily fast pacing. Right from the beginning we are thrust into the action without properly establishing why these rigs are at the bottom of the ocean in the first place or why these particular people are operating them. It is hinted that some bigshot mining company is running things behind the scenes but the extent of their control over these underwater structures never truly feels as impactful as it should. Additionally, the lurid use of dark colours to emphasise its deep sea setting does a big disservice to the whole viewing experience. It became difficult to distinguish who was who in their suits while navigating the ocean floor and whenever danger was presented to them, I wasn't sure who had survived or not. Worst of all, by the time I had figured it out, I remembered that I didn't even care about that character to begin with so trying to ascertain who they were all along felt pointless in the end. In spite of this, there are some fleeting creative choices in cinematography, showcasing the backdrop of humanity's ignorance of our own ocean, for which we know less about than outer space. It's a shame moments like these are wasted in a film like this.As far as the cast goes, I feel only Kristen Stewart is worth mentioning. Even though her character's backstory is woefully underwritten, to her credit, she still gives a surprisingly good performance as a mechanical engineer who understands the technical aspects of the rig she works on. Even though she comes off as a bit young to be playing a role like this in certain scenes, I think Stewart is a good actress overall who is clearly trying to escape the stigma of the Twilight franchise people still associate her with even to this day. However, scenes where she tries to fight off the monsters by herself never felt convincing enough for me to take seriously. It is clear she is trying to emulate the strong no nonsense female action heroes like Ellen Ripley in the Alien series, right down to the short hair, but she has a long way to go before she'll ever be on that same wavelength.While it's not completely terrible, the film is just so frustratingly mediocre in its execution that it simply isn't worth one's time. There are so many other sci-fi horror films out there that you may as well be watching instead and this one will likely be forgotten about very shortly. At least, at only 95 minutes in length, it is all over before you know it.I rate it 4/10",Underwater
100,meydiana-65242,A sci fi horror movie that grabs you and does not let you go to catch a breath. Underwater,3,18 October 2020,"(3.5 out of 10 stars).Underwater is a science fiction horror film that delivers a claustrophobia thriller with a good cast ensemble and performances, edgy music score, and a direction that feels like this film is trying to bring back a 1980s sci fi thriller like Alien movies, The Thing, or The Abyss (minus the creatures in this movie). I will say the film packs a punch with putting you into the action in the opening scene when an underwater facility is torn apart. Survivors Norah (Kristen Stewart), Paul (T.J. Miller), Lucien (Vincent Cassel), Emily (Jessica Henwick), and Liam (John Gallagher Jr.) are trying to make a way to the other station to find the evacuation pods. While the earthquake that shook the facility was not an ordinary quake. The drilling station has awakened something on the oceans surface with creatures that are trying to hunt the remaining survivors.May not be a fresh plot or concept idea. Underwater facility drilling in the oceans surface. Releasing some giant monstrous beast. And an army of humanoid creatures. The concept and plot is still exciting. As a group of survivors are trying to survive and escape from the stations before it collapses onto each other. They will go into claustrophobic settings of crawling into tight spaces. Or walking out onto the ocean surface with big underwater suits. Which the camera pans into their faces making it feel claustrophobia with the darkness out in the deep sea. Which anything can come into their faces at any given moment. I will say the film is intense and thrilling not really scary at all. It does try for a few jump scares with something running towards you. Or popping out in front of the screen.The cast ensemble was good. Kristen Stewart's performance is good playing Norah, a character that is struggling on leaving people behind in life and death situations. Stewart is coming along way with her acting. And she worked great in delivering the role. The music score by Marco Beltrami and Brandon Roberts worked well delivering an edgy sci fi horror movie tone. Director William Eubank did a good job in creating a sci fi horror film. The movie begins with action and never stops for a breath until the credits roll. The first half is about characters trying to survive the wreckage. While the other half is the people getting killed off by a creature which barely shows. And they are trying to survive and escape.I will say my one issue with the movie is the quick editing cuts when the creatures are attacking them. The lighting is dark as it is cause they are out on the sea floor. It is a lot of fast editing cuts and shaky camera movements which can make it a little confusing. Sure, it was probably done to create the intensity direction on what is going on.Overall, Underwater is a pretty fair film. It could be a lot worse. It turns out to be a worthy sci fi horror film that is worth watching if your into those kind of movies. It is fast paced with action, has a good cast ensemble, and puts you onto the edge of your seat.",Underwater

102,CANpatbuck3664,You've Seen Parts of it Before but Underwater Has its Moments and Some Thrills to Boot,7,26 February 2021,"So many movies today begin slow and ramp up as it goes along, one of my favourite parts of Underwater is that it really opens with a bang! Disaster strikes in the first 5 minutes and the action hits hard. People are hurt, people die and it helps the gravity of what's befallen our characters ""sink"" in. Not only is the result terrifying but its really well shot and the movie hits the ground running. I'd rather a movie save the best for last but there's something to be said about a film that grabs your attention right away.As much as I want to defend this movie, the core concepts are formulaic. Underwater is very much like Alien at the bottom of the ocean. But despite it borrowing pretty liberally from what preceded it in the genre, they try to put their own spin on it. The scenes taking place outside of the compound are suitably hazy, it can be frustrating that the picture isn't crystal clear but I think it helps bring you into the environment. The monsters aren't wholly new but they have a distinct ""lovecraftian"" feel and look. Although we didn't get the required time to really build a bond with the characters, that's a staple of the genre and it just isn't that type of movie. So while elements are familiar, I was able to forgive parts of Underwater for being a little too commonplace.Underwater has some recognizable names in the cast, its headed up by Kristen Stewart. She doesn't get much room to stretch but she's grown a lot as an actress. I was pleasantly surprised by her really good work in Charlie's Angels and she gets the job done again here. Cassel is more stoic but he's got plenty of screen presence and he's a pleasant addition to this cast. Jessica Henwick doesn't get too much time but even in this supporting role, you can see why she's on her way to bigger and better things. Mamoudou Athie elicits sympathy as Rodrigo and TJ Miller (his personal life aside) has a few moments as Paul Abel.Most of the effective scares and thrills in Underwater come from the environment and how helpless our crew is against the terrible circumstances. The supernatural threat eventually reveals itself and its a different kettle of fish. But most of the goosebumps that I got from Underwater were from how dangerous being at the bottom of the sea is and how little you could do if you ran out of oxygen, if the integrity of their suits were compromised (there's an effectively chilling scene addressing just that) or if the pressure were to buckle their man made structures. Its not a new setting but its less familiar then some and it helped keep me uneasy throughout the runtime.Underwater doesn't reinvent the wheel but I do think its unfairly criticized. It could have been more unique but it functions well within the genre. It also has good bookends but on the flip side, the middle does drag and that can definitely make people check out. Its a mixed bag but it does plenty right (I would categorize it as more of a supernatural thriller instead of a horror movie), it reminded me a lot of 2017's Life (Jake Gyllenhaal and Rebecca Ferguson) and how that movie got beat up from the movie going public while Alien: Covenant was just allowed to skate by on the goodwill from the franchise. It made just as many, if not more mistakes. Underwater is not the best of its kind but I thought there was enough here to justify a 1 time watch. Its a decent crew trapped in a dangerous environment horror/thriller and I'd give Underwater a 6.5/10 which I'm rounding up into a 7.",Underwater

Undersea mining operation mishap creates life threatening situation of the survivors at a nearby base. And a struggle for survival it is. Dark viewing given the 6 mile under the surface setting. Stewart somehow manages to instil her lax, disenfranchised persona with technical science knowledge to be the driving force to solve the situations. And she is rather believable in the role. The rest of the cast do what they can with standard character roles. The film brings nothing new to the genre, but it does display what the director and production crew are able to do (and do well).

A buzzed haired tough trucker type drill worker. Digging deep into the Earth for minerals (instead of..say...space ore hunters...ahem ""Alien"" or science exploration at the Antartic...um...""The Thing""). Fine. So director William Eubank doesn't fight the tropes instead embraces them and makes it interesting.
Not surprising, coming from a former Panavision employee, this is a visual exercise in darkness and dirt and grime and just claustrophobic atmosphere. I'm completely cool with that.
Unfortunately, what is lacking is how we should care about the characters. Kristen Stewart plays Norah, the tough cookie who is also a survivalist. Much has been said about her unlikeability OR her supposed inability to act. Both, I feel, untrue. Vulnerable, sad eyed and somewhat sexy (who else can rock a buzzcut and still remain feminine?...Sigourney Weaver?). Her melancholic voice over simply adds to a wounded person underwater.
Personally, I think the alien life form seems really unnecessary. It's enough to survive after an accident. I think that was the difference between making it a VERY interesting character study, into a b-movie horror flick.

Every actor did a top-notch job, even (or especially) Stewart and Miller, who both took the opportunity to show what they're capable of as actors. Underwater was a solid movie that had an unfairly harsh time with both audiences and critics, and I'm not even sure I understand why (oh no, it's BvS again). This didn't need twenty minutes of character-building, the development's all there nestled in amongst the tension. It's a really good movie, seriously.

Given the situation I could not understand why the other female lead had to keep screaming all the way through the movie, presumably to add drama but really a woman in that situation working at the ""coal face"" in mining corporation (another Alien similarity) is unlikely to be ""so afraid"".",Underwater
115,ebeckstr-1,A Muddled Message Mess,5,5 December 2020,"I've seen worse movies but that is not exactly a ringing endorsement. Underwater is not a particularly compelling movie, but in some ways is passibly entertaining. The sheer mediocrity is part of the problem. In addition, whoever wrote the script doesn't seem sure about what kind of message they want to send. At various moments characters decry going too deep to drill oil, and that people are not meant to do so, and these ideas constitute a classic eco-horror theme of environmentalism; but then at other times, like during the climactic moments, in which the unimaginative and typical approach of destroying all monsters is taken, the messaging is exactly the opposite.This can't have been an easy shoot, with most of the action taking place wet. There are also some attempts at character development, and the creatures are suitably Lovecraftian. But none of this is enough to salvage this movie from anything other than forgettable mediocrity.",Underwater

119,stevenrotherforth,Runs out of oxygen pretty quickly,5,11 April 2020,"UnderwaterWhat a wasted opportunity this movie turned out to be.
William Eubanks deep sea monster movie hits the bottom of the ocean running but soon runs out of propulsion becoming a lazy cliched snooze fest.
There's lots borrowed from Alien/ Aliens and just about every other good Sci Fi horror movie of the past forty years.
It's sad as the promising start and decent turn from Kristen Stewart is unable to save this movie from sinking.The crew of a deep sea drilling facility become under attack from something sinister lurking in the depths.
It's all been done before and much better. Even low budget 80's chessefests such as 'Leviathan' and 'DeepStar Six"" offered more. Not to mention the vastly superior 'Abyss'.With a budget of 80 million dollars there's some impressive visuals and Eubanks direction is fine.
It's just that the film becomes boring and generic very quickly.
None of the characters are memorable and the script is thin to say the least.
I wanted this film to be great. I'm a massive fan of the genre. 'Jaws' is my favourite movie and the novel 'Meg' by Steve Alten is my favourite book. I even enjoyed the movie adaption.

121,TwistedContent,"Underwhelming Script, Good Cast, Great Visuals - An Awesome Popcorn Flick",6,21 February 2020,"I was quite excited for ""Underwater"", I love an entertaining creature feature & there's really not enough horror movies taking place in the depths of seas or oceans. It was awful to see how ""Underwater"" flopped financially, so, even though late to the party, I managed to commit the price of one ticket. The verdict? I'm both happy and disappointed with it. But mostly happy.""Underwater"" is a prime-time horror popcorn flick in which Disney had no faith and so it got dumped in cinemas on January. I want to believe it'd have done better in box office if it was released in summer, like, for example, last year's creature feature ""Crawl"". But sometimes it is what it is, this flawed but highly entertaining Cthulhu movie had a bad fate in store for it. Yes, the monster at the end was indeed the Cthulhu himself (confirmed by the director William Eubank), although that's as far as Lovecraft's influence goes in ""Underwater"" - only in monster's design and location.""Underwater"" entertains from start to finish, its big budget provides top tier special FX and a great aesthetical outlook in general, definitely makes a great big screen experience. It's not exactly of the non-stop-action kind, but in ""Underwater"" we move forwards always, the question is how fast. Kristen Stewart, Vincent Cassel and the rest of the cast of six provide solid acting performances, can't pick on much there. Besides being a visually pleasant experience, ""Underwater"" also has good sound design and decent original score. So these are the things I'm happy about. Now the disappointing part. Movie's biggest flaw is its story. While all the elements at play provide all kinds of goodies, the script tends to drag all that down a little. Why? Well, it's a story that's taking uninspiring turns, uses a bunch of tropes we're all painfully familiar with, the characters, for the most part, also fit that bill. Mildly predictable, mostly conventional story. As a horror, it's not as scary as it is entertaining, but, thank god, it doesn't cover itself in unnecessary amounts of cheese.I doubt ""Underwater"" will find any kind of cult following, but I do urge You to see it on the big screen if You can. Or wait for the blu-ray and find the biggest TV available. My rating, with a heavy heart, 6/10.",Underwater
122,Mike_Devine,"Unique setting, weak story",5,2 January 2021,"We're accustomed to seeing thrillers set in unique settings, from alien worlds to outer space. But rarely do we get to watch films set seven miles below the ocean. Enter 'Underwater' - a visit to the depths of the Mariana Trench where we follow a drilling crew as they try to escape an unknown peril.At first glance, 'Underwater' appears to be a throwaway monster flick that belongs in the $5 DVD bin at Walmart (if those still exist). Don't get me wrong - it lives up to that reputation. But it's not the worst thing we've seen in recent years. For one, 'Underwater' wins points for creativity thanks to its location. It's difficult to make a movie feel like it actually takes place in water, but William Eubanks is able to somehow accomplish this (perhaps thanks to his background in cinematography). There are also a few interesting easter eggs thrown in that are not necessarily caught at first glance.On the other hand, 'Underwater' loses points on a number of fronts. The sound mixing is really rough; at times, it's pretty difficult to understand some of the dialogue, even if it's not the usual chaotic crosstalk. Kristen Stewart does a better job than she usually does, but she's still not a great actress compared to many of her peers. Others on the cast are pretty ""meh,"" with T.J. Miller's comedic relief being a weak highlight. And then there's just the typical generic plot and story flow that leaves little room for surprise.'Underwater' was pretty much left for dead and dumped into theaters as part of Disney's acquisition of Fox, but it's not as terrible as it should be.",Underwater

127,jamiedarlow-37510,Brilliant sci-fi thriller!,8,10 October 2020,"I've always found the deepest darkest level of the sea to be fascinatingly frightening. This might've stemmed from the Angler fish scene out of Finding Nemo! I mean, check out images of that creature, it's quite something. So the concept of the film Underwater released earlier this year really appealed and in a way it's unlike any other sci-fi horror that I've seen before. The story arcs and narrative structure we may have seen many times but just the setting it's in and the danger it presents to the characters makes for a really exciting watch. Norah (Kristen Stewart) is a mechanic working in a high tech submarine base in the deep depths of the sea with a team of 315 others working on drilling into the ground to find what lies underneath. After a seriously damaging tremor occurs leaving many of the team dead, the remaining survivors embrace an escape mission only to find unburied horrors along the way. I loved the twist made about half way through the film and thought the unknown threat becoming known was really cool! It's great to see something with a mythological background become realised on the big screen. Stewart is becoming increasingly one of the coolest movie stars in modern times and the entire cast do a great job; it's pretty refreshing to see Vincent Cassel play a nice bloke for once! It's stylishly beautiful, has a fantastic music score and I'm already looking forward to watching it again 😀",Underwater
128,fciocca,"Slightly above my expectations, a decent story, overall a good cast, definitely worth a watch if you are a science fiction lover",6,22 September 2020,"I was very skeptical about ""Underwater"" and honestly I was expecting the usual wannabe sci-fi trashy movie with big stars, just to gain people's attention, instead the movie looks pretty solid. Of course, we are not talking about the most beautiful or original movie of the genre, as the story is pretty average, but the script is good and scenes are very immersive. The director managed to generate a lot of anxiety and tension, avoiding cheap jump scares. What you have is a production that immerse the viewer in the story.On the first three minutes of the movie we already know the backstory, so the movie start immediately with a big explosion, that will destroy partially the underwater base built on the Mariana Trench, for research purposes. The six survivors that we follow need to escape, facing a dangerous and mysterious treat. During the movie a lot of scenes are shot directly on the first person perspective, by using the suites ""body cam"" POV. A nice way to build up tension and that made me stay glued on the screen until the very end. Speaking of which, was very disappointing and completely uninspired. I was honestly hoping for something less predictable honestly.The cast is formed by very important names such as Vincent Cassel, Kristen Stewart, which I really never appreciated as actress, but I have to say that in this case she made a good job and she was pretty much convincing and expressive and T.J. Miller that as always needs to play the part of the stupid/funny guy. It is stuck in this kind of role, and I wish to see him for once on a different part one day, maybe a little bit more serious.Special effects and CGI are convincing, and I really liked monsters models and the whole underwater locations that we have for the whole movie.

Director: William Eubank
Starring: Kristen Stewart, Vincent Cassell, Mamoudou Athie, TJ Miller, John Gallagher jr, Jessica Henwick etcOverall rating 86/100Underwater is based on a crew of oceanic researchers working for a deep-sea drilling company, try and get to safety after a massive earthquake hits, but they are not alone under the water, they must fight for their survival. I had a great time with Underwater and was on the edge of my seat throughout, I am really warming to Kristen Stewart now so lets talk about this more in detail,First of all, I thought the concept was great, as well as the cinematography and use of sound. I thought the whole concept of the movie was really interesting and well explored, the jobs of all the characters and the plot was just really interesting to me and despite the plot similarities I had never seen it done in this kind of setting before. The cinematography was also fantastic, despite a large portion of the film being CGI I still found it fantastic to look at. The underwater sets and the wide range of different locations kept you constantly entertained and some of the visual creativity was great as well. I also really liked the use of sound throughout, the film did a really good job at creating sound or effects without you knowing the source of where it was coming from, this kept me constantly on edge and nervous, the lack of sound in some scenes was also very effective in creating a frightening atmosphere.My next few positives would be the tense tone, Jumpscares and creature designs. The movie managed to execute an extremely excellent tense tone throughout. You were constantly on edge not knowing when anything was going to happen, one of the main reasons for this was that they played on peoples fears really well. The film played with fears of drowning and claustrophobia and made that part of what made the film so tense and scary, so this was very cleverly done. Also, the Jumpscares were very well executed. They weren't predictable like in some horror movies, they were well earned and unexpected. The creature designs were also really interesting and terrifying. They looked genuinely scary, and it made you connect with the characters more due to the fear of watching them let alone actually being there in the movie.My next few positives would be the gore, likeable characters, and the great lead performance. I thought that the film used gore very effectively throughout. It wasn't used often but I felt that it was deliberately done to create more of a shock when there was. And they definitely achieved this with some intense gore scenes that made you empathise with the characters and feel genuinely scared for them. All the characters were also very likeable, and all had at least one part of their personality that made you like or connect with them. This improves the experience of the movie because you don't want anything to happen to the characters there making you feel even more tense and on edge. Kristen Stewart also did a fantastic lead performance here, she showed versatility here, and her character was very likeable, and I believed every emotion that Kristen showed throughout, showing that her acting ability is improving in every new role that she is in.However, a few negatives that bought the film down slightly was the lack of background to the plot and characters, and the lack of depth to the plot and characters, as well as sometimes having an inconsistent script. The film went straight into the action which we will talk about soon, in some ways it was a good thing, but it meant that the characters and the plot didn't really have any background at all. We didn't know anything about the characters, or really anything about what was going on in the plot,, so this was slightly odd for me and made the film hard to connect with at first, The plot and characters were also sadly very self-explanatory and lacked any real depth or development, This was a shame as there was so many great components to the film but this bought it down slightly. The script was also at times inconsistent and not always the strongest. There was some plot holes and lack of description within the script to give the audience a proper understanding of what was going on, and some of the lines were slightly awkward and generic for this specific genre and didn't always work.My final few positives would be how the film went straight into the action, there was some attempts at depth to the main character and the final act was fantastic. The film didn't mess around when going straight into the action which I appreciated, it made you on edge straight away and that feeling never went away, so they executed there desired tone and atmosphere right off the bat, there was also some attempts at depth with the main character which I appreciated, they gave Kristen Stewart's character some slow building of background to her character throughout, we slowly learned more things about her family and reasoning behind her behaviour which made you feel connected to her and want a positive ending for that character. And finally, the final act was great. They really went all out underwater horror which I loved, it felt well earned after the slow building of tension throughout and exploded that tension out into a very entertaining and satisfying final act of which some things you won't see coming.Overall, despite a few depth and script issues, Underwater is a very good thriller/horror that achieves a perfect tone and atmosphere throughout and made even better with the fantastic main performance from Kristen Stewart.",Underwater

Regardless of whether they did well or not..it was a fresh idea all the time...many of them turned into classics.

Mine happen to be heavily with pacing and direction the director took with this movie.Zero character development at all to the point you don't even care about anything that happens to them.

Final issue I had was the constant use of darkness, I understand director is trying to give the viewers the feeling as if they're submerged with the characters.

134,madhukar30,Is Underwater terrific? !!,3,4 September 2020,"The terrific part of Underwater is the song ""The Unknown"" which played while the end credits rolled. The movie was well, there was lot of water, there was lot gear, there were lots of debris, there was creatures of various sizes, there were 2 women and 5 men in all and there was one big VFX aided blast in the end. That's all I could fathom in the 90 odd minutes runtime.Jokes apart, the problem with movies such as underwater is that, the studios are banking on the same genre which had brought them bag loads of money previously. They are so blind to realise that this ""Genre"" is so overdone. I believe this particular story is literally stamped on the brains of people who are born after 1970, no kidding but seriously anyone among the audience watching Underwater would have been qualified enough to work with the director William Eubank on the story & screenplay. Yes, it was that simple, and horribly predictable.Apart from good Cinematography & a quality Production design team, there was absolutely nothing at all in this one BIG boring dull affair. Screenplay was a big letdown on this one. The basic necessity for any filmmaker is excite the audiences with novelty, I am afraid the production team of underwater completely failed to do so. Acting was another sore point of the movie. But I would have to thank the editor for keeping it around 90 minutes, I can't imagine watching the movie more than that.Overall, skip this movie and do something worthwhile for the 94 mins, I assure you whatever you do in that time will be much better than watching this movie.

Movies steals, er borrows heavily from Aliens, The Descent, The Meg and never stays on point long enough to follow.1. First of all, Kirsten Stewart cannot act. We already knew that from the Twilight series, but figured with a different genre, writer and director maybe she could halfway manage(like Kneau Reeves in the Wick movies). Answer? No. From scared, depressed, death, excitement or curiosity, her face never changed or showed any visible emotion. Sadness.2. Director definitely took the Game of Thrones route of showing what you believe is action but in complete darkness, quick editing and shaking cam so that you have no idea what is going on. In several scences, you could not tell that someone was missing(nor did you care anymore).3. Yes, there has to be manufactured drama so a movie can exist, but a movie should not depend on manufactured drama from beginning to end. In movies where people are astronauts or divers, it takes years of training and psychological analysis to even be picked. Here all the of crew are SERIOUSLY mentally and/or emotionally incapacitated and this is quickly established in each character's initial statements.4. Science?

141,darkreignn,Kristen Stewart brings this movie from stunning to breathtaking,5,13 January 2020,"Wow. I thought Kristen Stewart was beautiful in ""Charlie's Angels,"" but ""Underwater"" takes it to a new level, and not just because the film takes place a billion miles under the ocean. For the last act of this film, Kristen Stewart romps around in just her underwear, and I found it increasingly hard to not pull a Pee-wee Herman in the theatre.""Underwater,"" directed by William Eubank, was apparently filmed in 2017 and is just now releasing to kick-off the new year, and the new decade. And what better way to kick it off then to see Kristen Stewart half naked and glistening from water for the majority of the film? In all seriousness, besides Kristen Stewart's incredible body, there is some other stuff to enjoy in this movie. For one, the direction and cinematography are pretty good. The movie has a distinct look, and it's clear the director had a vision for what he wanted to see. From the very beginning, the movie looks great, very crisp, clear, and eerie. When we finally see inside of the underwater vessel and get our first glimpse of a tantalizing Kristen Stewart, the camera pans slowly, allowing you to get a good view of not only her body, but also of the vessel itself; it almost reminded me of a Ridley Scott type shot, and it's evident that ""Underwater"" takes inspiration from Ridley Scott movies. And when things get going, they really get going. The movie has a kinetic pace that never lets up once it starts, and there is a lot of thrills to be had here, especially during the sequence when the vessel first starts to breakdown. Also, there is a third-act creature reveal that is, bada**, to say the least. Unfortunately, where ""Underwater"" shines the most is also where it fails; i.e., the pacing.Yes, we all love fast-paced films that keep you feeling a sense of tension throughout the entire running time (""Uncut Gems,"" for example). However, ""Underwater"" has pacing so incredibly quick that it makes the movie almost incomprehensible, and not just because of how dark and shaky it is. Seriously, this movie needed a brightness boost and a camera stabilizer because for the majority of the movie I could not tell what was happening and who it was happening to. At one point, one character gets dragged by a monster (or maybe an Octopus, I'm really not sure), and when they show who got dragged I was like, ""Oh, I thought it was someone else, I didn't realize it was this person being attacked."" Like, sure, in the beginning the shaky cam actually was effective, but only because it was used in a well-lit environment where everything was crystal clear. Use that same shaky cam in a dark, poorly lit environment, and suddenly you realize that shaky cam is never a good idea.Also, there is a notable lack of character development in this movie, again, because of the pacing. The movie kicks into high gear almost as soon as it starts, not leaving any room for meaningful characterization, which means you'll barely care about what's happening and who it's happening too. The only character I even remotely cared about was Norah, solely because she was played by Kristen Stewart. And that's a shame, because the cast and the acting were all fine, they just needed more to do other than run from one set piece to the next.""Underwater"" is an okay movie for quick thrills, and I'll probably buy it to add to my ever increasing Kirsten Stewart collection, but a lack of characterization coupled with the incomprehensible pacing keeps this from being a recommendation on my part.5/10",Underwater

Being a fan of sci-fi/horror films, I had made my mind up to see the film, despite the poor reviews. I don't know what movie those critics had watched, but I found myself liking to this movie very much.I am not a huge Kristen Stewart fan; actually, I think she's kind of a flake. She turns in a solid performance, and makes for a fairly decent action star. T.J. Miller plays his usual funny guy that dies character, much as he had done in ""Cloverfield"". Everyone played their parts well.The tension and suspense start fairly early in the movie, and pretty much maintain a taut edge until the final few moments. The film has elements of ""Alien"", ""The Abyss"", and ""Cloverfield"". The ending leaves room for a sequel and if a sequel is made, I will definitely go and see it.",Underwater

I was bored through the majority of this. Lucky I'm too buggered from work to care. Most of the time it was difficult to tell who was where and what was happening. Spacial orientation for the viewers was bad when they were 'water-walking'.
And ye ol' subwoofer was running hot. Too much bass, too much of the time, which diminishes the moments where extra impact is really needed.The character chemistry which exists in say The Abyss was not present here. If the script lent more time to us so we could get to know them and their communal relationships, it would have booted the film. You could see the actors trying, but they were limited by the script, or badly directed or someone edited the crap out of them.If you are a fan of any actors in this you'll probably get something out of it.",Underwater
149,kevinxirau,An okay dive into the horrifying unknown.,6,25 May 2020,"What if you take the basic premise of ""Alien"" and set it in the deep sea? You get ""Underwater"", directed by William Eubank. It's one of the last films released by 20th Century Fox before Disney bought it, which led to it being released at an unfavorable time for cinema. This contributed to it being swept under the rug, which is kind of a shame since this film has a few merits.Plot: The story centers on a drilling crew (chief among them Kristen Stewart). The group were working at the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the world. However, there are some places man was not meant to dig and, sure enough, they end up awakening something hidden in the dark depths. This forces the gang to risk venturing out to find a means of escape while being hunted by monstrous entities.A good method to sell horror is isolation and there are few places more terrifying than the deep sea; darkness, cold, intense pressure, and life forms too alien to describe. The cinematography is done well, bringing forth claustrophobia within the station's cramped halls and the characters' POV when they walk outside in diving suits in low visibility. The horrors plaguing the crew, while not scaring me much, are effectively creepy. Though obscured by the environment much of the time, the film shows just enough for the viewer to get an idea of their appearance. Further details sprinkled throughout indicate something out of Lovecraft's playbook. The characters are kind of meh. None are bad, in fact a couple I liked such as T.J. Miller, but none leave a big impression outside decent character moments and interactions. Kristen Stewart, while not a great actress, at least has more to do here than let sparkling vampires whisk her away. Part of the issue is that after the cool opening credit sequence establishing the setting, the chaos happens almost right away, leaving little room to familiarize with the crew members before their perilous journey. I will say I didn't quite expect the conclusion to play out the way it did (in a good way).""Underwater"" admittedly doesn't offer much that's Oscar worthy and even I wouldn't call it one of the great horror classics. That being said, the setting and presentation do make it stand out, resulting in a passable experience.",Underwater

But if there are to be monsters, there is always a bad sign in such movies when we hardly see them. In addition, the script is not very inventive. Most have been stolen from Alien, but without the nerve and excitement. But there are more than enough doors that do not open, and closed escape routes. And low oxygen levels to the repetitive ... Without it helping anything. We've seen most things before, but maybe not in this environment. Not scary enough, and surprisingly few monsters. When they first show up, it's not very exciting. Below average this.",Underwater

152,tfminfl,A Monster at the Bottom of the Sea story,7,21 January 2020,"379. Underwater. A straight to the action, claustrophobic thriller. Story begins with scantily clad Norah getting ready to start her shift at the laboratory at the bottom of the ocean. And by the sudden alarms going off and the entire structure rocking back and forth, something went wrong. it's an earthquake, and its tearing the place apart. And so it's on to find others and to get to escape pods. Oh the earthquake also woke something up down there, and it's big. Who knows maybe its there just to say hi to the new neighbors, but it doesn't really look that way. Because the movie mainly focuses on action, we never really get to see Kristen Stewart make that awkward face, you know what I mean, so that was a plus. TJ Miller was in it, as some kind of odd man-baby scientist, so I thought that was pretty stupid. Overall it was a decent action sci fi flick. Just remember like a famous Jedi once said: ""There's always a bigger fish."" Filmbufftim on FB.",Underwater
153,Bertaut,"A well-made creature-feature; it may not be original, but it is entertaining",7,23 February 2020,"The last film distributed by 20th Century Fox before they were rebranded as 20th Century Studios by Disney, Underwater was shot in early 2017 for $50 million and then sat on a shelf for over two years. Now that it's finally seeing the light of day, there's a real sense of Disney just wanting to be rid of Fox's clutter, and they either didn't know how to promote it or didn't want to promote it, as the marketing campaign has been next to invisible (and the bland title certainly doesn't help), with the film grossing a paltry $7 million in its opening weekend. From Disney's perspective, of course, releasing it in the January release window makes sense, as it's a period traditionally dominated by duds and cast-offs - films the studios don't care about for one reason or another. A recent high-profile example is Blackhat (2015), Michael Mann's underrated cyber-terrorism drama, which was released with little to no advertising, grossing only $20 million at the North American box office against a $70 million budget. However, much like Blackhat, Underwater is considerably better than most January releases. Sure, it's clichéd and predictable, and it shamelessly borrows from a litany of superior genre films, but it's also a very entertaining and enjoyable aquatic creature-feature.At an unspecified point in the future, Tian Industries, the largest drilling company in the world, are attempting to drill into the ocean floor at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, almost seven miles down, with atmospheric pressure over 1,000 times that at sea-level, strong enough to crush a human body so completely that there aren't even any remains. As the film begins, Kepler Station, the crew quarters of Tian's massive drilling rig, is hit by a series of unexplained vibrations, causing a cascading pressure breach. Norah Price (Kristen Stewart) and Rodrigo Nagenda (Mamoudou Athie) are the only ones to escape, sealing off the area so as to slow, but not prevent the inevitable implosion of the whole rig. Heading first to the escape pod dock, they find no pods left, and in the control base, they're unable to contact the surface. Meanwhile, they encounter some other survivors - Cpt. Lucian (Vincent Cassel), Paul Abel (T.J. Miller), Liam Smith (John Gallagher Jr.), and Emily Havisham (Jessica Henwick). With their situation grim, Lucien says the only hope they have is to use pressurised suits to walk the one-mile distance to the Roebuck Drilling Station and use the escape pods located there. And so they descend to the dark ocean floor. However, as if their task wasn't daunting enough, they soon discover that they aren't alone.Written by Brian Duffield and Adam Cozad, and directed by William Eubank, Underwater walks a very fine line between rip-off and homage. The most obvious touchstones, both narratively and aesthetically, are Alien (1979) and The Abyss (1989), but one can also see the influence of films such as Leviathan (1989), Event Horizon (1997), Sphere (1998), and Sunshine (2007). I even detected a slight nod to The Descent (2005). In short, the set-up is your classic ""group of isolated people getting picked off one by one"". When someone as talented as Danny Boyle turns his hand to this template, the result is a near-masterpiece. And although Eubank is most certainly no Boyle, Underwater is a lot better than its lack of advertising, clichéd premise, bland title, and generic trailer suggest.Sure, it isn't really about much of anything. There's a vague ecological theme that's brought up a couple of times, with Emily talking about how humans have drilled ""too deep"" and are now suffering the consequences, but really, it never amounts to anything even half-way substantial. In all fairness though, who would be expecting thematic complexity anyway? You know what you're getting with a film like this, and the best you can hope for is that it looks good and is entertaining. And Underwater is both.Kicking into high-gear immediately, the film wastes no time whatsoever in getting to the action. The opening scene is the Kepler implosion, and it's a good five minutes before things calm down. Alien takes its time getting anywhere, introducing us to the aesthetic of the Nostromo, then the characters and their relationships and milieu before it all kicks off. In essence, Underwater is the inverse of that, with all hell breaking loose before we know much of anything about anyone. Indeed, the only character we even see, let alone get to know, before the implosion is Norah. I certainly wouldn't want every film to open this way, but it has an undeniable kineticism and appealing volatility, which Eubank does a decent job of maintaining throughout the next 95 minutes.Aesthetically, there's a lot to like here. Production design is absolutely paramount in films like this (think of how important design elements are in building tension and establishing tone in Alien or Event Horizon), and designer Naaman Marshall does a fine job, with the world feeling lived-in and authentic. Making especially good use of tunnels and low ceilings, there's a real sense of claustrophobia, which only lets up, ironically enough, when the characters are outside the safety of the rig and exposed to multiple dangers. This claustrophobia is aided immensely by Bojan Bazelli's cinematography. During scenes outside, Bazelli often shoots from within the characters' helmets, and even when the characters are inside, he often shoots in tight close-ups, simultaneously anchoring us to their perspectives and heightening the sense of enclosure and pressure (both literal and figurative). When outside, the film uses the limited visibility to its advantage in establishing a tone of ominous danger. Some will probably find these scenes too dark, but I'd argue that that is precisely the point; the characters can't see much of anything, and neither can we.Elsewhere, obviously inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, particularly Cthulhu, Abner Marín's creature design is suitably creepy and grotesque. The aesthetic element that really stood out for me, however, was Wayne Lemmer's sound design. The implosion scenes are accompanied with some bone-rattling LFE, whilst the ominous ambient sounds of the Kepler are a constant reminder that the station is on its last legs. The scenes outside are equally as impressive, with some excellent use of directional sound as the action shifts location on screen - it's a film that I would imagine will sound incredible on a 7.1.2 Atmos system.In terms of problems, there's a rather unjustified use of voiceover to bookend things, explaining the moral of the story; it's wholly unnecessary and has the effect of making the film feel like an episode of The Outer Limits (1995). There's also next to no characterisation. We learn bits and pieces about Norah and Lucien's backstories, but apart from that, the film is peopled by perfunctory cardboard cut-outs with no sense of interiority. Eubank also seems somewhat confused as to whether he's making a disaster movie or a monster movie, with certain scenes and elements suggesting one or the other. However, he never really finds a middle-ground, giving the film a slightly schizophrenic tone.Although Underwater never manages to rise anywhere near the heights of films such as Alien and Sunshine, it deserved better treatment than it received from Fox and Disney. Given the January release, the clichéd setup, the two-year limbo, and the bland title, I wasn't expecting much from this, but I was pleasantly surprised. It won't change your life, but it's an entertaining and well-made creature-feature.",Underwater

Its January, which is notorious for being a dumbing ground for film studios to put out the films they have absolutely no faith in whatsoever to be good. Now and then very rarely you do get a decent film in the month, I'm glad to say that ""Underwater"" surprised me a bit and ultimately deliver what I wanted. A simple/basic story, some interesting characters you can get behind, some nice CGI and maybe some nice scares/suspense along the way.So with that in mind I went in completely cold, didn't watch a trailer for the film....I hadn't even read the synopsis of the film. Maybe that affected my viewing of the film..........I had NO expectations !Its just all round good fun! Simple story, an underwater mining facility is mysteriously breaking apart/ being destroyed.........the group of survivors inside have to figure a way to get to safety and to the surface ! Bang ! Simple enough for anyone to follow, check ! Next some interesting characters to follow, you've the stereotype of everyone in this film. Kristen Stewart, the smart, brainy, quite one which the film centres around. Vincent Cassel, the leader of the base, old and wise. TJ Miller the comic relief, obviously ! Jessica Henwick, the doctor, I think ?? Who is terrified and screaming all the time and lastly John Gallagher Jr, the chilled pilot sort of guy!!! They are all stereotypes but they all do their job in this film very well, there is a good team dynamic throughout !! Great CGI of the base braking apart and the suits they walk in, also nice design of the creatures !! Lastly some decent scares...........and some really nice suspense driven scenes ( Well pretty much the last half of the film is pretty near the edge of your seat..........its not that good enough to be on the very edge of your seat, but close )Cliche deaths,Yes !(Surprisingly Gory) Cliche Ending, definitely Yes ! Do I care, No ! Not every film has to be overly complex, long, overbearing, emotionally driven and sad/depressing. You can just to watch a standard science fiction film and enjoy the ride, everything about and in this film is absolutely fine......its not going to change the world and it doesn't have to.Overall its 65% out of 100 its a decent/ ok film.............I wasn't expecting much or anything and actually enjoyed the experience..........Good directing, acting , script and definitely runtime !!! Oh what a great idea of making it 1 hour 30 mins.........the film gets you up to speed with whats going on quickly and it never really stops after that..........the film flies by.

So, where do we begin?For one, Kristen Stewart is not even remotely a competent actress. The casting director must have considered her a suitable stand in for the ageing Sigourney Weaver. But she's not. Sorry for the comparison, but like it or not, it's deserving. While Sigourney made a career out of her portrayals of Ellen Ripley, Kristen makes only a mockery of modern cinema.Anyway, based around the Cthulhu Mythos, a ""Shared Fictional Universe"", developed by horror writer H. P. Lovecraft, our Heroine crews aboard Kepler 822, a research and drilling facility, operating at the bottom (And this is Peyton Manning Deep!) of the Mariana Trench. Then comes the Cliche Earthquake that turns this face into a story.Eventually (No surprise here!), Stewart's character, Mechanical Engineer, Norah Price finds herself alone aboard an abandoned Winch-Shepard where she finds, of all things, a Pentagram on an old blueprint. After a quick change, Price leaves the Shepard and heads across the Seafloor on Foot (Seriously - again!) where she reunites with some of her crew members.And soon the fun begins! Because, as usual, the Monsters await Price and her crew members along the way to their destination.The best part of this movie is that: (HUGE SPOILER ALERT!) there will likely be NO sequel because our heroine is KIA.

161,Slarkshark,Unable to Reach New Depths,7,14 December 2020,"'Underwater' seems to be a a bit of a mash up of other films. We clearly have an 'Alien' feel which is the most obvious comparison. It could quite honestly be a prequel to Pacific Rim. But, also almost has the same story line as Megalodon, at least when it comes to where the monsters come from.I'm usually a fan of ocean movies, especially when it involves man eating monsters, so I was inclined to like this from the get go. There is also so much mystery when it comes to the deepest depths of the ocean, so that also instantly draws me in. Wasn't that scary, but there's definitely some anxiety with a combination of deep water, tight spaces, and mysterious monsters.The whole concept that this is an underwater drilling station at the bottom of the Marianas Trench is highly ambitious. From looking at the tech and those neat looking suits, I would have to think this takes place quite a few years in the future still. For some insight into what deep water drilling is really like, I would recommend watching 'Last Breath'.All the acting and characters were fine. TJ Miller filled the comedic role well. A lot of people like to jump on the hate train when it comes to Kristen Stewart, but the reality is she has come a long way since 'Twilight'.Not an overly realistic movie for a variety of reasons, but still a solid B creature feature.",Underwater

Things far scarier than sharks can be lulrking in the pitch black depths and the events of this film take place at the very bottom.From the first moments, Underwater feels somewhat similar to Alien having a certain resemblance in terms of style, crew and the atmosphere. It is not a horror movie; more of a sci-fi thriller that feels scary because you don't know what is out there but you understand that you can't escape it. The claustrophobic sequences and the absolute darkness establish a feeling of breathlessness while watching the film.The film turns up the pressure within a first few minutes packing a straightforward plot without pretending to be anything more than a sci-fi disaster-monster movie and its honesty is what made me like it.

166,MinistryofDoom,Kirsten Stewart channels Ripley in this Tense Sci-Fi Thriller,6,21 January 2021,"Kristen Stewart channels her version of Sigourney Weaver's Eleanor Ripley in Underwater. I had really high hopes for this film. After seeing the trailer, I got the impression that it was invoking Ridley Scott's claustrophobic high tension terror classic, Alien, except.....at the bottom of the ocean in the Mariana Trench. To some extent, it feels that way. There are definitely scenes that full of edge-of-your-seat tension and feel claustrophobic, invoking feelings of panic and anxiousness. However, at the same time, it suffers from several issues that are too great to ignore. I understand that it takes place aboard an underwater drilling station in the Mariana Trench, one of the deepest and darkest parts of the ocean, which is still largely undiscovered and probably full of wildlife we still have not fully identified yet. That is awesome. It's never been done before, as far as I can recall. Unfortunately, the story is not fully realized; frankly, it doesn't make much sense. You'll need to suspend your disbelief and just roll with it, but it's not so bad that you'll want to shut off the film. Some scenes are so dark that it's too difficult to even make out what's happening, and the heavy use of CGI, isn't consistent throughout. Sometimes it looks good, other times it looks like cartoons super-imposed over a scene of Kristen Stewart swimming in a pool. However, despite all that, it's still a great movie.In fact, it's one of the best ones to cme out in 2020; certainly much better than anything Sy-Fy has made. While, again, it does have it's many flaws, it really is an entertaining film. Boring is not something that I'd associate with ""Underwater""; not at all. Kirsten Stewart is a fantastic actress.

They're either extremely well made and praised by critics all over the globe, some also get totally crushed by the competition in the same opening weekend, others are just complete and utter trash. 'Underwater', bringing absolutely nothing original to the table - although it thinks it does -, isn't all bad.A crew of aquatic researchers work together to get to safety after an earthquake devastates their subterranean laboratory. But the crew has more than the ocean seabed to fear. What has been sort of spoiled in tv-spots and other promotional videos, is that something is hunting these researchers. We follow mechanic Norah (Kristen Stewart), who's survival skills are put to test, when these tremors and whatever lurks outside their ""safe space"" relentlessly keeps trying to kill what doesn't belong belong this deep in the ocean. Six-point-something-miles-deep to be more specific. As many might or might not know, the bottom of Earth's platform has so many secrets, and that's exactly what 'Underwater' uses to try and scare its audience.Writers Brian Duffield (The Babysitter) and Adam Cozad (The Legend of Tarzan) have trouble bringing anything remotely interesting to the big screen. Clearly inspired by sci-fi classics like 'Alien' and 'The Abyss', Underwater doesn't even try to stand out. The only standouts here are K-Stew and co-star Vincent Cassel (Black Swan) - who do a phenomenal job at showing fear while kicking ass. Another standout for the film is its cinematography. Bojan Bazelli (A Cure for Wellness) has an eye for angles and dives into that fear of claustrophobia with impressive closeups of the desperate crew's facial expressions. Although the sets are quite limited, the costume design of the diving suits is something worth mentioning.What's so problematic with Underwater, is its build up to something exciting and thrilling, yet as soon as that tension is underway to get you covered in goosebumps and burst into a series of hot flashes, it cuts away to a black screen and time jumps to another location. This doesn't only make it very confusing for the viewer to keep track with where our survivalists are at that given moment in time, but it also pulls you out of the story completely. For a 95-minute long film, Underwater feels much longer than it actually is and when the second half dives into a sea of CGI-creatures (and water - it never really looks like as if these actors are actually underwater), it turns into a total 'Alien' rip off - subaquatic Ripley included.Unfortunately Underwater is just a bit blasé. Loud screeching jump scares and an uninspired screenplay, turn William Eubank's $80 million sci-fi thriller into another genre-film forever stuck at the bottom of the bargain bin at your local Kmart. Director, cast and most of the crew will for sure get back to shore in given lifeboats, while yet another post-Fox-merge-title gets thrown to the sharks.",Underwater

The title and opening voice over lend themselves to ambiguity, making the viewer wonder if all of this is taking place in the protagonist's mind, but the title cards and end cards imply that if she was imagining it, she wasn't the only one affected. You can ignore those little bits of misdirection if you want to, because the vast bulk of this movie is a good old fashioned underwater creature feature disaster movie. If you loved Leviathan, Deep Star Six, Deep Rising or even The Abyss, here's a movie very much in that vein (but particularly like Leviathan and Deep Star Six) only it's been updated with 21st Century production values. It also makes a valiant attempt to reflect overall 21st Century values, but the characters barely have time to do anything but react to the monsters and disasters, so it's not exactly rich characterization going on here.

Underwater is basically ""The Abyss"" meets ""Cloverfield"" but not as good as either. Imagine if ""alien"" was directed by James Cameron and that is Underwater.
A group of mismatched scientists and basic crew members are trapped at the bottom of the ocean when a group of unknown sea creatures is unleashed and begins to kill them off one at a time.
It pays homage to the basic horror movie jump scares and tension of what you don't see, but it doesn't do it well and certainly not in any sort of original manner.
My belief is that the director figured making everything dark and loud would be enuf to make people pay $15+ at the box office.

The pacing was good and it was entertaining. Some of the criticisms about the lack of originality in script are true. It was a bit formulaic.The criticism about it being too dark is valid, too. I don't know why new horror directors think dark means MURKY. If a scene is correctly lit it has a combination of darkness and light that intensifies the emotion. I'm guessing a large amount of the underwater scenes were CGI and they established that a lot of lights were still working on the rig so I have no idea why they didn't use that plot device to make a better lit movie. The ending was a little off, as well. The idea that a computer program would show a perfect representation of pods and creatures was pretty silly given how real the rest of the technical elements felt. And I didn't really agree with where the writer took the ending.I thought Kristen Stewart was good in it. She was pragmatic but still provided the 'heart' in the drama.

I enjoyed director William Eubank's ambitious eye for futuristic sci/fi in his other films; LOVE and The Signal, but he upped the ante to gargantuan heights in this film. Eubanks should be a director to watch for the Sci/fi thriller genre as he is absolutely brilliant with his keen eye for detail and intense visuals. Apparently this film was shot in 2017 but Fox studios waited on it. There is definitely influence throughout from films such as Alien, Leviathan, The Abyss, Sphere, and even Cloverfield, but it utilizes those inherent aspects perfectly to still have its own incredibly vicious identity.The film starts with insane intensity and never lets up with action and thrills in its massively detailed set pieces and terrific deigned brutal creatures. The cast is uncanny but surprisingly charming, intriguing, and funny at times. I think part of this film's unfortunate partial sabotage ratings/bad box office (15Mworld on 80M budget) comes from people misjudging Kristen Stewart for this particular role. She doesn't deserve the hate she gets and is actually phenomenal in this story with a great deal of emotion and perseverance. TJ Miller is the comedy relief and hilarious as always. Vincent Cassel is his solid standard self, and the others are solid as well.As things progress in depths things get viscerally chaotic with some of the coolest creatures I've seen and I've seen them all as a big sci/fi guy. The creature designs are impeccable, and i give the visual effects team great respect for conjuring up such ballistically sinister deep sea monsters. After so many films it has to be difficult to keep coming up with unique concepts for these creatures but they had huge imagination with these. Trust me when I say the final act is GARGANTUAN in itself.Overall this film is a visual feast for the eyes and ears (soundtrack/sound fx amazing as well) of most Sci/fi/thriller/action/horror fans especially creature/monster fans. I think this will go down as one of the better deep sea horror's when people finally see it. Don't let the misleading low ratings fool you, as this is a fantastic film.",Underwater
197,nahumthebest,"No plot introduction; terrible screenplay/script; good CGI/cinematography except for first scene; acceptable ending; good last 30+ mins of ""horror""; Kristen good acting",8,4 July 2020,"100% spoiler-free.48% on RT.
5.8 on IMDB.
80% of google users liked this movie.
Budget $50-80M; box office $41M.Summary/conclusion of my review (1): atrocious joke of a screenplay/script - it was very bad. I have never seen a screenplay/script as bad as this one. Another huge problem in this movie was the fact that it does not have an ""introduction"" phase like any other movie you can think of, and instead it randomly starts off with a poorly produced cinematographic/CGI scene, which is the scene that kicks off the movie's plot. Such scene felt like the scene you would expect to see around the 30-40-minute mark, and not at the seven-minute mark. Such a horrible start to a movie. No explanation is offered as to why such an event occurred and this is never discussed in the film at all.(2) The CGI and cinematography were actually ""pretty fine"" throughout the movie though, except for the very first one that kicked off the movie. Kirsten Stewart did a great job in my opinion despite a poor script and poorly made film, and she, the cinematography/CGI, and the ending are the only redeeming qualities of this film. The supporting cast was decent enough with Mamoudou Athie showing the second best acting (I mean he genuinely looked afraid). The ending was surprisingly satisfying and ""felt right"" - this part was probably the only piece of writing that was actually written properly.(3) Overall, is this movie worth watching? If you are a Kristen Stewart fan, then yes. If you are a horror fan, then probably yes but you HAVE TO remain patient. I mean, this movie does deliver over 30 minutes of some horror ""attempt"" which I will not fault. The CGI/cinematography and Kristen and the director stepped it up for the last 30+ minutes of ""horror"" and because of those 30+ minutes, the fine ending, and Kristen's slow-motion last final scene, I say this movie IS worth watching despite the worst screenplay/script ever, poor plot (was there even a plot?), and lack of an introduction. The first hour of the film probably deserves a 5/10, but the last 30 minutes probably deserve an 8. I liked the last 30+ minutes so I will bump up the movie's overall score to 8/10 too.Below are some other thoughts:The movie almost immediately jumps into action with zero explanation and it does not make any sense. Any other movie (e.g. Life (2017), Gravity (2013), The Abyss (1987), etc.), would have started out with introducing the characters and what life was like to be working in the vessel and somehow lead to the climactic moment. Instead this movie starts out with a very poorly made cinematographic climatic scene of some sort that felt totally fake? This decision most certainly is a reason why this movie did so poorly with the critics and the box office.Also, the robotic alarm voice in the background sounded all-too familiar and the volume and clarity did not make sense. The voice did not sound like it was coming from the ship, but instead it sounded as if the voice was added to the movie during editing. The same issue happens later when the robotic voice says ""oxygen level critical"" except that once again it sounded like it was added on top of the videos during editing instead of making it sound like it came from inside the suit. Sounded so fake. Surely I have heard that exact voice in previous movies - it sounded exactly the same. Could they not have come up with something more original and also actually have the voice sound like it was actually coming from the ship and suit?Screenplay/script problems: at the 11th minute, ""Are you a computer engineer or something?"" Since an introduction was completely skipped in this movie, the protagonist is introduced by having another character (actor Mamoudou Athie) ask her a question for the obvious purpose of introducing Kristen's character to the audience. I mean, how can the crew not know each other? Later when this character meets up with the rest of the crew, they do not even exchange a single word, acknowledge each other, or act as if they know each other. Nobody asks for his name either. And yet the rest of the crew seem to know each other and Kristen. Mamoudou's character seems completely out of place and very amateurishly put into the movie. Moreover, not once, do any of the characters ever ask in the movie, what happened?, as in, why is the ship suddenly so extensively damaged? This is common sense. Then they hear strange noises and nobody asks what those noises are or might be? At the 52nd minute two characters finally ask what is going on and I mean, it ""only"" took 52 minutes to ask what anyone with common sense would have asked at the first minute, but nothing comes out of those brief questions. Later when the BIG ""_____"" is introduced, the characters do not say anything at all or ask what it is or act shocked or terrified (the director failed here too to instruct the actors). Seriously? You just saw the most terrifying thing in the world that would make anybody ____ their pants, and you do not say one word or act terrified? This movie has the worst screenplay I have ever seen in a movie.The only good line in the script was ""Let's go put our lives in danger"" 31:56. Why could not we get a good script?Kristen Stewart - great work.
Mamoudou Athie - good acting.

198,casablancavic,Somewhat enjoyable for a free movie,2,2 April 2020,"Pros - it was free to watch, it had a cool premiseCons - anything remotely science relatedWhile the entire substation oncept was interesting, I found much of it to be stupid.Drywall in the bathrooms - as well as wooden framing
Tiles on the walls and floors
Lots of wiring and electricalNow I uderstand that it was to be livable down there and also that it was a working environment - but to build something that big, send it far below the water and have it fuction to full capacity with as much space as it had - does not make any senseThe construction for such a unit is far too big to be functional and safe in an environment where nobody has gone and done a proper survey for constructionLet alone safety standards, who designed the building? Which arcitechts went below the water and decided to build such an enormous structure and how would they even think that it could hold up to the water's pressure?How about generating the plumbing systems and drainage for a full size bathroom facility with multiple toilet systems and sinks and showers?Then in addition, there is drywall and tiles on the walls...which drywallers decided to install sheets of drywall at 35 000 feet below the surface? How did it all work?What about all the electricians and the plumbers?That all involves hundreds of contractors - if not thousands - and then it also involves movers and people that are required to do daily operations such as cleaners, cooks, safety and health officials.For a unit as big as that substation was supposed to be, there should have been roughly 50 -80 people on the staff - and each of those people would require a certain amount of adequate space for movement.All this planning and then the operation of the drills and computer system will require massive amount of knowledge in construction - and I just don't see what kind of contractors would have the knowledge of designing something as big and operational without having any understanding of the depth and pressure and environment of the Mariana trench.What would have made this good is if this was a 2 or 3 part series where the initial construct was made, installed and then put to use - adn then all the trouble came about.To start this movie with everything in place already working makes no sense.The laying of wiring - as much as the construct has will require hundreds of miles of wire- and a team of people so skilled that the budget would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.The plumbing systems, the framework and wiring, the cooking facilities and communication systems are all massive - and the design would takes years upon years to complete from initial design and layout to the end of it's construction.That would have made a far better story than just throwing people into an underground facility and having it fall apart.To see this operate from it's very beginning would have been so much more interesting.From the people in the offices talking about the design, to the designers, to the conctruction crew, to the training of the workers, to the installation, to the operation - until the point of the earthquake and damage.A 3 part movie or 1 very long movie that starts from the very beginning would have made this film just super awesome - but because of poor plot development and bad science knowledge, this sadly failed.It was so evident that they were walking roughly 30 feet below the surface - because after that, the movements underwater begin to totally change - and the temperature of the water becomes very very cold - let alone at 35 000 feet.They didn't look cold, they didn't look weak, they didn't look tired. They didn't look hungry. They didn't look scared.They didn't even seem like being in water would need to make them go pee.Believe me - when people are surrounded by water - they have to pee. When they are soaked, they have to pee.This was bad direction adn to not realize this made this film barely passable.Next time you are in a cold and wet environment with nothing to eat, nowhere to sleep, worn down - trust me...you are going to pee. Maybe 4 times an hour.It was a good thing that the monster ate them - otherwise there would be more stupid people on the top of the planet - and we already have far too many as it is.",Underwater

200,boris_unanimate,SpongeBob Squarepants is way scarier than this,4,12 April 2020,"Underwater came off as another horror flick set deep below sea, in the vein of'Leviathan', 'Deepstar Six' and 'Deep Rising', movies I enjoy rewatching because they are good campy entertainment. Underwater started out promising, but once they introduced the deep sea creatures, it got bogged down in the same old boring storyline that is a shameless copy of O'Bannon's 'Alien'.The basic premise of the movie was engaging - people locked in a place without a chance to escape - and a lot could have been done with only the danger of being so deep below the surface. It would have made for a suspenseful race against time. But the writers obviously could not be bothered with original concepts, or trying to evoke genuine scares with atmosphere and good writing.It had some interesting moments that would have made for good horror if written and executed better. However, once the creatures show up, it turned into another failed attempt to cash in on cheap scares with CGI monsters. It's 'Alien' but without the enticing plot or interesting characters. There are failed attempts at the final girl trope as well as action heroes. It is what it is - a big wet failure. Very predictable and entirely unnecessary ""horror"" flick.",Underwater

She does play a great prepubescent young boy, however.And let's talk some things that are unrealistic:A guys glass helmet cracks open at the slightest pressure change before he gets into water, but the rest of the cast can go down another mile, get slammed into objects, attacked by creatures, blown up, eaten, dragged around, and their helmet never breaks.The crew wore huge, weighted suits so they can walk on the bottom of the ocean, yet they can magically walk with ease when not in water.They take their helmet off the second their heads pop out of the water, repeatedly, yet the water is at their neck level splashing around and nothing gets inside the suit.For being around so much water, their clothes and bodies seem miraculously dry most of the time.There's plenty more.",Underwater

203,cappiethadog,Lost ocean,6,23 January 2020,"Lena(Natalie Portman) gives her head a subtle nod. The biologist confirms what her interviewer(Benedict Wong) in a hazmat suit already guessed for himself, verified at last as the truth, while talking and listening to the lone survivor on behalf of the personnel occupying this military compound. The ""shimmer"", an expanding translucent coating that originated from a lighthouse, with the potentiality of breaking perimeter after perimeter until there is no perimeter left. This deconstruction zone, spreading like a disease, which dispassionately corrupts flora and fauna, animals and humans alike, was indeed alien. Incidental body snatchers, more or less, is what the half-widow describes to Lomax, when recounting her encounter with the alien life form, a blank slate awaiting the transference of DNA. Kane(Oscar Issac), her husband, is not her husband. Alex Garland's ""Annihilation"", a sci-fi film about the possibility of an unnatural sixth extinction, echoes ""Underwater"", directed by William Eubank, with the difference being that our planet's annihilation starts off-land, not on it, and its threat is man-made, not alien. Emily Haversham(Jessica Henwick), a scientist like Lena, more so than the other Kepler 822 Station earthquake survivors, knows that drilling the ocean vents for seafloor massive sulfide deposits comes at a steep price. ""We don't belong here,"" Emily surmises, not long after she inspects an unidentified sea creature that nearly killed two divers exploring wreckage for survivors. Everybody knows they're looking at something terrestrial-based, but only Lena makes the connection between the discovery of this new species, a mutation, and the environmental fallout from mining the Mariana Trench. Cracks in the floor heat up the water and creates acidity. The ocean, in essence, is dead. There are no schools of fish to be seen. Whales? Sharks? Coral reef? ""Underwater"" quietly makes the point that an increase in water temperature hurts species diversity. Whereas the giant sea creature in Ishiro Honda's ""Godzilla"" symbolized nuclear power and its byproduct, the oceanic monster in ""Underwater"" can be interpreted as nothing less than an embodiment of global warming. This humanoid ate everything in the surrounding Pacific Ocean, even the jellyfish, as if it was climate change with sharp teeth. Ironically, it takes a nuclear blast to save Emily and Liam(John Gallagher Jr.) when Norah(Kristen Stewart), a mechanical engineer, stays behind to stop the sea creature and its minions from pursuing her friends in escape pods by raising the energy levels on the core.The sea creatures in James Cameron's ""The Abyss"" are aliens, therefore smarter than their Mariana Trench counterparts. Mastery of ocean movement; that's their power. A water tentacle, whose salty tip is equipped with a camera eye, snakes itself aboard Deep Core, an underwater drilling platform, and identifies a trident missile, which poses an imminent threat to their survival. Although the humanoid in ""Underwater"" lacks the technology to anticipate a mushroom cloud(as seen in the director's cut of ""The Abyss""), it guards the Roebuck Station's entrance because instinct, something akin to waterlogged street smarts, tells the creature that Norah and her friends can harm it, once inside the facility. By default, Norah stays behind on account of a malfunctioning third escape pod. Torn between her love for Liam and her accountability in creating this biological anomaly, Norah punches Emily square in the face like an MMA fighter before the suddenly concussed scientist can make up her mind. Whereas the mechanical engineer had nothing to lose, the marine biologist would be a purer hero, since killing the monster, for her, theoretically, serves a higher purpose; a sort of penance, a hairshirt made from seaweed, after making the conscious decision to sell out science by helping a corporation destroy the ocean. Virgil(Ed Harris), in ""The Abyss"", knows that his descension to the ocean floor would be a one-way trip when he volunteers for the suicidal task of disarming the nuclear weapon. Oxygen running low, Virgil is resigned to die. But then, recognizing this man's heroism, the NTIs save Virgil and deposit him in a dry room, isolated from water, on their wet ship. On a screen, the aliens let mankind's representative know that they've been recording the evildoing of his kind for generations. A Godzilla-sized tidal wave is put on hold, frozen at its apex, because the aliens intercepted Virgil's last transmission to Lindsey(Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). ""Love you, wife,"" he typed out. Thirty years later, the metaphor changed; this wave of mutilation, from a call for nuclear disarmament to climate change awareness; a threat. A man who loves a woman would not be reason enough to call off the sixth extinction. ""Underwater"" more than suggests that we're past the tipping point. This humanoid, symbolic of global warming, poses a greater danger to people than the radiation that emits from a nuclear reactor. Radiation couldn't stop Godzilla. Radiation can't do anything about the change in weather either.""Underwater"" updates ""The Abyss"" for the 21st century, via ""Annihilation"" with its theme of the human impulse for self-destruction, as a means to extrapolate how capitalism has run amok. Tian Industries conducted interviews. Liam can corroborate everything that Emily tells their corporate employers. The truth can be read between the lines of those misleading newspaper articles that drives the cover-up narrative in the film's epilogue. Despite the danger, the drilling company is going back, ready to face another, if not the same mutation, until every living creature in the ocean is annihilated. Whereas Deep Core would heed the aliens' warning and stop drilling, Tian Industries would set off another underwater nuclear bomb if anything gets in the way of its profit margin.",Underwater
204,jonnytheshirt,Enjoyable for Sci-Fi fans with a hint Lovecraft,7,29 March 2020,"I for one enjoyed Underwater - yes there's various plot holes, what movie has none. There s bit of a question why it went so under the radar with such a great cast (I for one like Kristen Stewart she's done her time since the teen vamp stuff). Its no Abyss and lacks a certain movie gloss however the reason I''m guessing is the Lovecraftian influence. Del Toro's been trying to get a Lovecraft movie of the blocks for years but they do not lend themselves well to blockbusters, well because Lovecraft is so dark. We had another Lovecraft influenced movie recently in the Nicolas Cage led Colour from Outer Space which was wonderfully bonkers. With Video game and movie story telling blurring more and more Underwater does remind me a bit of some Sci-fi games - the detail is there, the intro and end credits expand the story and explain a bit more, disembodied voice messages adding atmosphere as to the environment, as well as pages not even focused on in shot giving more information - some stuff is not spoon fed to the viewer. It does get off to a good start I thought and takes place over not a long period of time. I'm not sure if it would look better in the cinema or not - had a very short run - the in water shots were kinda unclear. However for me its a 7, that's because I appreciate that Lovecraft influence - mainstream viewers may not. It will get compared to Alien and Abyss but to me it does have its character aspect similar to a Lovecraft short story, and that I liked.",Underwater
205,mitchell5954,Surprisingly Entertaining,7,15 January 2020,"Underwater is a film I was on the fence about seeing. The trailer interested me some, but it's a horror movie released in January, which is never a good sign. Plus, it stars the actress from the Twilight Saga. However, two of my trusted reviewers gave it a positive review, so I decided to check it out. I have to say this was a fun time at the movies. The effects were great. It has a great atmosphere, and a fast, thrilling pace. Within the first five minutes we're thrust right into the action. All the actors do a good job, including Kristen Stuart, which surprised me. Despite the Twilight films, this film proves that she is a good actress.This film is a creature feature, but does the smart thing of not showing the monsters for most of the film, letting the audience use their imagination. For the first thirty minutes its just our characters caught in a bad situation, of their underwater base collapsing, and having to just survive. It reminds me of Jaws or the original Cloverfield. This does feel like Cloverfield, but underwater. In fact, this movie is what The Cloverfield paradox should've been like.Now, the move I won't say is great, or one you need to rush out and see. The premise isn't that original. Films like The Abyss, Leviathan, Deep Star Six, and Sphere have a similar plot, among other films. All of these films are quite underrated and receive a lot of undeserved hate, much like this movie has.
There's not much in the way of characterization here. It's mostly plot driven. It's really the actors' performances that carry the film and make us care for these characters rather than the writing.Overall, if you're a fan of movies like Cloverfield, Leviathan, or Deep Star Six then I say give this film a watch. It sucks that this film has gotten a bad rap from critics, and even the studio that made it. It was originally supposed to come out in 2017, but got shelved for almost three years, and then got dumped here in Hollywood's garbage month where no one will care to see it. That really is a shame.",Underwater

2) you never get a clear view of themHowever, you have to know Lovecraft to love this. Why?? Because Lovecrafts monsters are not something we know anything about, as far as origins, and they have ZERO motive.You have to understand that his monsters have the same motive against us, as we do walking down the street and stepping on an ant. The only possible motive is we are in the way. They think nothing of us, as we think nothing of a single bug, or bette yet, a cell.Once you understand that, you can easily enjoy the monsters. Especially the ending one...those asking where it came from, how it lives down there, etc...you're thinking outside of how Lovecraft monsters are written. The point is we don't and can't understand them...and YES this was a Lovecraft monster (the directors words)If you have issues with the script itself, I can understand that...yes it started off with a bang with no character development...which I've never had an issue with. The Thing, widely regarded as the greatest monster film ever, did the same thing. I've always kind of preferred that, so it's less of an issue for me...Stewart is also a hot button actor...but she was fine I thought.I gave it a 7 because yes, it WAS too dark and too man quick shots...but overall for what it is, I enjoyed it.",Underwater

(although i think Steward could do better if she wanted .. as for the rest of the cast .. they were mostly stereotypes)What i liked:
plausible communication and decisions made by the protagonists (i cannot value that one high enough for a movie of that type)Mostly good effects .. (visuals)What i did not like:
very predictable storyline .. you can almost predict the order in which the cast is picked offmaybe a few plot-holes here and there .. for the sake of storytelling and suspense...The characters were mostly one dimensional and tbh .. not exactly very interestingTo sum it up .. i think there is a balance of good enough and not so great.",Underwater

221,Amthermandes,Shenanigans on all the negative reviews!,8,24 November 2020,"Viewers dive right into the action with this sci-fi horror piece about a small band of surviving crew members at the bottom of the ocean, fighting to make it back to the surface after a horrific drilling incident releases hostile sub-human creatures. The largest disappointment with this film, is the overall response from viewers. It's not nearly as bad as many make it out to be. In fact, there's a lot to praise this movie for.The cons: CGI in abundance here, as usual for a visually-focused sci-fi thriller. There are moments when practical special effects could have been used to make it seem more ""realistic"". However, that being said, the CGI wasn't bad at all. At times the water and lighting made it difficult to make sense of what was occurring on screen. The plot is quite predictable, it's obvious not a lot of thought went into it. Characters were all either one-dimensional or wooden. It definitely felt like a modern, high-budgeted B-movie. You can tell when movies are made largely for the purpose of generating revenue, and this feels like one of those. Yes, plot holes and implausibility exist. But I dare you to point out ONE sci-fi thriller/horror that didn't have at least a handful of such traits, and was generally well received.The pros: It was an effective thriller/horror, quite intense at parts. Despite the CGI crutch, the special effects were fun and interesting. There were some solid scares, a few of which I'm sure a lot of people missed unless they were paying attention. Such moments were well done, and possibly caused a viewer to exclaim ""whoa, did something just move right there?"", or ""were those eyes?!?"", and ""did anyone else see that??"". The murkiness of the water, and lack of lighting DID make it difficult to see at parts, but that, I'm sure, was intentional, and added to the bleakness of the environment. There were entertaining character deaths which, let's be honest, is something EVERYONE enjoys vicariously in films such as this. And yes, we all were skeptical of the film because of who was cast as the lead. And while Kristen Stewart has not progressed as proficiently as her ""Twilight"" counterpart, Robert Pattinson, her acting was not bad at all, and the same can be said for the rest of the cast.Summed up, it's an enjoyable ""popcorn flick."" Definitely not one to take seriously, so if you hated it, it could be that you didn't follow the one rule of watching these kinds of movies: Cast aside your disbelief, and just enjoy the ride.

222,GavWaskett,What do you call a shrub growing underwater? A shrub-marine,6,13 September 2020,"Okay, what is going on with me, this is the second Kristen Stewart film I've watched recently (Charlie's Angels review to follow). But to be fair, the trailer for this had an Alien/The Abyss vibe and I love both of those films so had to dive right in!An underwater(shockingly) research and drilling facility gets into some serious trouble and most of the crew are lost, the few survivors have to head out onto the ocean floor to try and save themselves and encounter some creatures who have the opposite idea for them! Now can you see the links to Alien and The Abyss?Kristen Stewart continues to build up her action resume as the heroine Norah and to be fair, she didn't annoy me for once and I can see her developing quite a nice niche in this genre. T.J Miller is annoying as Paul but ALL of his characters are meant to be, I do wonder if he can act without being annoying or if he is just the best annoying actor out there? Jessica Henwick as Emily shows why she is getting the bigger roles now and I'm looking forward to seeing her in Godzilla v Kong and Matrix 4 and Vincent Cassel is a great choice the Captain of the ship, rough and ready but with a heart.Now, don't get me wrong, this isn't a great story, in fact I think it was a great idea which hasn't been executed brilliantly but it is okay. The cast work well together and the concept has enough about it to build up the tension, but it has one main problem(and I'm not talking about Kristen Stewart surprisingly), it is so dark that I could not tell what was going on most of the time when they were away from the facilities. The death scenes happened really quickly and it all got a bit confusing. I know filming underwater is going to have its difficulties but this got silly, I had no clue as to what was going to happen next, not because of suspense but because I couldn't see what had just happened!Now, if this was Alien or The Abyss, it would have justified a 19/20 but it's not and as good as the concept was and how well the cast interacted, it was let down by its execution and by being all foggy!

223,lord_cw,effects are well made only the story line and details needs to be better,7,19 April 2020,"When you watch this movie, every moment you are on the tip of the seat but do not know what happening and it is pity. They should lead the viewers better. The music the effects the acting very nicely done. Like the dry humor what did not push through most of the movie. Like they opening up the world of the undersea and what possible our future could looks like with good details only in some scene that is pity, this movie could be easily a three hour one, what could be made so much better but could be less much action and less horror scifi and leaning towards a more romance.
Hate that actors are cutting off that fast, so only main character is playing whole the time not that I am complaining but still more interaction will be nicer. The plot should be explained more in details so viewers could understand it better. Really like how they explain the environment problems that you face and with right effect.Good movie but could adjust more and the ending could be done better so it can lead to a second movie.

226,TheCasualReviewer,An adequate telling of a simple premise,5,13 January 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
A group of aquatic researchers experience a malfunction in their base that they believed to be an earthquake. While trying to get to safety, they realize that something much more sinister caused the wreck.REVIEW SUMMARY:
I want to start off saying that I don't think simple premises are bad in any way. A lot of times it's very refreshing to tell a simple story. By simple, I mean a movie that is very surface level with no underlying message. A movie made simply to entertain and nothing more. When you make a movie like this, I expect something great. There's a plethora of writers who can take a simple story and make it entertaining and so that's what I expect. You can take a basic premise and make it a little deeper or complex and that can work very well or doing something a little different. Take ""1917"" for instance. Two soldiers that have to relay a message without dying. Simple. Then you have Sam Mendes making it appear to be one seamless shot. That's taking a simple premise and adding something extraordinary. You had a solid premise here with solid acting and a fantastic claustrophobic setting. Unfortunately, I didn't have any part of the story to grasp on to. I was thinking it was going to be the story with the creatures (not a spoiler, it's in the trailer) that I latched onto, but I think they really dropped the ball on that. So much potential, but ultimately fell flat for me. 5.9/10.----------------------------------------BREAKDOWN------------------------------------------DIRECTION:
William Eubank does a commendable job here. He had very good set pieces and built an eerie and claustrophobic atmosphere in this film. There was quick pacing in this film, but I was almost begging for a moment to slow down, because this film really gets right into it from the moment the movie starts. In a lot of cases I love this, but when you have an ensemble of 5-6 characters, I think it's good to slow down in a couple moments and build character. I really savor those moments.WRITING:
Building off of what I said about slowing down and creating character development, I think I would've enjoyed this film far more. I didn't feel connected to the character in any way. They were all dispensable and it had nothing to do with the acting itself. Not even the dialogue. It really was all about the fact that the movie starts with a problem and a solution and the movie follows this formula from beginning to end with some minor distractions in the middle. It's in movies like these where it's very important to input character development. In a movie like ""Good Time"" there's a different situation in place with only 2 main characters who are brothers and don't need too much establishment for you to be on board with the quick pace. In a film such as ""Underwater"" where you know there's a large possibility of characters dying and going on this survival journey, it's important to feel connected. You want to care whether someone lives or dies and I just didn't.ACTING:
I really loved Kristen Stewart in this film. She really rocked as the introverted computer mechanic. I thought TJ Miller was great as comedic relief. He wasn't too much, just grounded enough to be believable. Then Jessica Henwick was also a star in this film. I really had no gropes with the acting in any way, It's just really too bad that none of them had a chance to establish their characters.",Underwater

233,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Drowning through Underwater,4,11 January 2020,"The Stream: Poor, boring and obvious plot development leads to a lack of empathy for the characters or their menaceThe Big Screen: The typical lifeless performance by Kristen Stewart strangely wasn't horribleThe Final Bill: Wait to view this on a streaming service if you can't find anything else to watch after scrolling a while.-S2S: Movie ReviewsGlub Glub Glub.... that's bottom of the ocean talk for ""Welcome to Stream to Big Screen"". This week we were able to review the movie, Underwater. Underwater features Kristen Stewart as mechanical engineer, Norah, who gets trapped in the world's largest and deepest drilling site and laboratory at the bottom of the ocean. Norah and the rest of her crew of aquatic researchers must find their way to safety and back to the surface before the laboratory, or worse, kills them. The Director, William Eubank, who has two previous directing credits to his name for The Signal (2014) and Love (2011) which didn't do anything in theaters, also has another upcoming feature, Tautona, which sounds quite interesting. Interestingly enough, Eubank has a common theme in his films of space or the deepest part of the ocean or cave. Uninterestingly enough for Underwater, the film seems to be following his other films into obscurity.Let's brighten this review up before it gets dark like the bottom of the ocean. This will be quick. Kristen Stewart was her typical lifeless, seemingly drugged, emotionless self. Surprisingly, that didn't ruin the movie. Kristen does a solid job leading us to the end of the movie as she is the main focus. The only other character of note is a crew member played by T.J. Miller. Without T.J., the film would've gone without it's comic relief. Thank you, T.J. That's all for the positives folks.Other than that, the film lacks development. If you should choose to see the movie, truly pay attention to the opening credits and newspaper articles like I did. The headlines of those articles basically give you the background of the film and that's all you get. The movie felt rushed. Strangely, the movie also slows down at times to bring anticipation and those moments also fail. The film lacks direction and development. There are context clues and slight discussion in the movie but none of it leads you to even really dive into the movie (you see what i did there *nudge nudge*). The little bit we get about each character's background only highlights every predictable character trope.Now, I must admit that I do love a bad movie. My wife and I set up date nights to try to find a good terrible movie on a streaming service, and Underwater doesn't even fill that slot. It's one of those movies that is trying so hard to be good, and it's just failing at all aspects.Now, watching the trailer, you will know and see that there is a creature that is attacking the crew. If you haven't seen the trailer, please watch it below. From the trailer, the creature looks like trash and during the actual movie, IT GETS NO BETTER. In fact, it gets worse. The movie really skimped on CGI, but the parts they did pay for I will admit were slightly cool. Needless to say, the creature you came to see attack them isn't even worth the money.This movie is nowhere near worth watching in the theater. They tried hard to give us suspense, comic relief, and a ""scary monster"" but it all failed, except a few giggles and a couple moments that made you say ""ooooooo"". At best, this movie gets one single popped corn. Check Underwater out after a solid 10-15 minutes of scrolling through your favorite streaming app and prepare to underwhelmed.",Underwater
234,helenbassett,Underwater Film Review - William Eubank Directs Kristen Stewart In A Claustrophobic Deep Sea Drill That Went Too Deep,8,27 February 2020,"In Underwater William Eubank directs a life with artificial light and the clock the only way to tell night from day. Kristen Stewart is an engineer, Norah, but let's call her Ripley for now, lost in her own thoughts, but shaken into reality when a catastrophic underwater earthquake hits the drilling station she is on board. Barely making it out alive with Mamoudou Athie's Rodrigo, they are forced to close off their wing to save the rest of the platform, and make a claustrophobic attempt to escape across the debris, picking up TJ Miller's rubble covered Paul on the way. Hundreds were on board, some managed to escape via pod subs, but now only six are left alive. With seemingly no way out.7 miles down in the Mariana Trench with no communications, Vincent Cassel, the Captain of the rig stayed behind after those who could leave left, and assesses the best chance for the six is to walk across the seabed to another part of the site, where there might be other pods. A one mile walk. Let's hope their helmets survive the pressure underwater.William Eubank doesn't allow time for second thoughts with everything moving so fast in Underwater. The beginning showed newspaper headlines and I missed some of them so I wasn't sure if they were describing pre-film events or after. I guessed after, as they continued in the end credits. But again so fast.But time is indeed of the essence in Underwater, with John Gallagher Jr's Smith, and the aforementioned Paul, adding light relief to the watery greyness. I thought TJ Miller's stream of novel puns was fun, and who on board drew the sea monsters on the walls I wondered. Pretty accurate actually! Bizarrely with the team suited up for their underwater walk there's no room for pants girls. Not in those one size fits all mega suits anyway, as Kristen and Jessica Henwick's Emily both strip down to their undies.But that is the least of their problems as after spotting a distress call from a previously released pod, Smith and Paul go for a deep see walk to investigate. And in the murky half light of what just happened, they manage to bring aboard a big pink prawn like creature that just happened to be eating, I think, an unfortunate crew member. Now dead but he's not alone. You can hear others banging the outside of the station. Did they happen to bring a baby onboard they wonder. One that has teeth. Ominous music by Marco Beltrami and Brandon Roberts. Walking a mile in their shoes is going to be a nightmare.I want to say that out there is a colony of mermaids and mermen released from the depths by the drilling company, but I don't think there are any singing Ariels. The filming took place from inside the helmets so we see what they see, the distance no more than a few feet. Although the usual horror rules didn't apply either as the sediment was so thick you could barely make out what was just about to grab you. Until it was too late. Still keeping the fear factor up though.Underwater is a disaster/horror/'ecological' movie that skips by in a deep breath of 95 minutes or so. Cinematography by Bojan Bazelli became clear when you realise the horror of the big prawns matched the tension of the deep. The aliens just added the extra, extra-terrestrial dimension of the need for speed. And walking underwater is slow. Maybe in space no one could hear you scream but here we are way out of our depth. And know so little about what is down there. What have we released in our need to exploit the earth's resources? Although the teeth are just as big as those other Alien Space beings. And as one of the big prawns was going for an even bigger mouthful, well thank god for the, I guess, stick of dynamite or similar. But that isn't the big bang, no there's something much bigger waiting in the wings.Even as the film was highlighting the potential dangers of drilling too deeply, it wasn't preachy and that usually kills a film for me. Such as Disney's Tomorrowland and Downsizing. So a lot of bang for your buck with a movie that gets straight to the action and keeps the menace high.

Alas, as many of us have learned over the years, the previews are often the best thing about a movie as unwatchable as this one.
My main complaint is that it was often just friggin' difficult to see what was happening because of the thick shadows and dark lighting that made me have to squint to try and see what was going on.
The story line was so disjointed that I quickly lost interest and because I thought this would be a type of Alien under the surface, I kept waiting to see who or what the enemy would be.
After an hour of trying to understand this flick, I just had to turn it off. The actors all looked as if they were literally in pain or under great stress but other than that, I didn't feel like wasting another hour on a movie that could have literally used more lighting to clearly show us what was happening in this dissapointing action flick.",Underwater

Sure, its not the ultimate in 'exploration crew in dire straits' movie, the creatures unfortunately have to 'growl' and are slightly overexposed at times but the picture looks great, creates some decent claustrophobic tension and the cast immerse themselves well through it all (pun intended). The Abyss, Deep Star Six and alike weren't all exactly groundbreaking properties back in their day anyway. We've waited a long time for another frolic in the murky depths and Underwater is definately worthwhile. The hardware is inviting and honestly, I actually look forward to watching Kristen Stewart these days. She certainly hasn't become stereotyped in her choices of roles.

The tension starts almost immediately and doesn't let go to the end. Kristen Stewart does a fine job carrying the film. Contrary to what other reviewers have said, Stewart does NOT spend most of the movie in her underwear. I'd estimate it's probably about 10 minutes. I don't see what the big deal is. It fits in with the plot. Needing to not wear pants under the 'space suit' is typical, I thought. This is done by Sandra Bullock in ""Gravity"" and likewise it was not gratuitous. The other actors are engaging and interesting to watch. Especially entertaining is TJ Miller. He's so fun to watch. His firecracker humor is such a gas!",Underwater
251,NavyOrion,Even my low expectations were unmet,4,28 January 2020,"The thing about AMC's new ""A-List"" program is that you get to see a lot of movies that you wouldn't otherwise risk $10 on, and sometimes are pleasantly surprised. ""Underwater"" was not one of those.The folks saying this was ""Alien under the sea"" really need to go back and watch ""Alien."" I'm sure the director had hoped his film would come off that way, but this dreck didn't even competently rip off the superior movie. Jumping into the action practically before the credits ended, there was never ANY character development, meaning you really have no reason to give a damn when a character dies.Dark lighting and ""shaky cam"" were probably rationalized as ways to enhance the mood (and maybe even worked for the aforementioned more gullible and undemanding viewers) but were most likely simply budget-cutting measures, to prevent too close an examination of the cheesy monsters.One simple measure that should have been taken would have been to make the diving suits different colors. At some points it's difficult to determine who is being dragged off to end his or her participation in the movie. Fortunately, by that point you no longer care.It's been said MANY many times before, but apparently it bears repeating. Hollywood, pay attention: KRISTIN STEWART CANNOT ACT. Look at her face in the movie poster at the top of this page: that is exactly how she expresses any emotion, whether love, hate, joy, fear, envy, lust, etc. It is beyond me why directors keep casting this piece of wood in starring roles, when they might just as well cast a nobody and put her in a Kristin Stewart Halloween mask. I was hoping to at least see her killed off, to prevent any chance of her appearing in a sequel, but I don't think there's any danger of that anyway. Spoiler alert: she does get killed at the end, but it was not satisfying, except to mark the end of a wasted couple of hours. And right to the point she blew herself up, she steadily maintained the expression of someone in the recovery room after a session of electroshock.Ah well, at least I didn't have to pay for it.",Underwater
252,mjfhhh,dials down artistry for the sake of the spectacle,6,22 January 2020,"UNDERWATER is a great example what may happen with an independent film maker when he gets more money to play with, but when the studio restrictions come with it. Director William Eubank, who helmed a mind-bending sci-fi movie THE SIGNAL, now dials down his artistry for the sake of the spectacle.The plot had been done to death - ALIEN, THE THING, DEEP BLUE SEA, you name it. At the heart of it we have Christen Stewart's Norah, the protagonist, and in the first few minutes she is thrown into turmoil, making life changing decisions that will haunt her for the rest of the film. Her story is an interesting one, but it is dimmed and dulled by the rest of the cast - cardboard characters, each of them a survival horror movie cliché. Although the acting overall is pretty good, there's only so much that can be done with what the screenplay allows. There is plenty of mayhem on display, but the gore is toned down and there's nothing particularly inventive about the character's untimely dispatch.There is good news too: the effects are fantastic and the sound is mesmerising. Marco Beltrami comes up with a score that resonates to the very core of the film, although you will not be humming a tune from it on the way out of the theatre. Eubank also hasn't lost his touch, his visual style is recognisable and the concept of the creatures is intriguing, the full scale of what they are is not revealed for a while, and it is a vision to behold.Focusing rather on action than claustrophobic dread and marvelling at monstrous creatures rather than making us afraid of them, UNDERWATER is a solid entertainment that sacrifices drama and originality for the pure spectacle.",Underwater

I'm not saying Underwater is as good...I'm just saying there are similarities.Some of the sounds reminded me of the creepy noise from Grudge.Various close-up shots reminded me of the tent scene from the Blair Witch Project.This wasn't an original concept for a movie, so there are probably a dozen+ more films that I could have referenced.I usually tolerate T.J. Miller, but he was extra annoying in this movie. I rooted for him to die and his stuffed bunny to make it to safety. I guess wishes can be granted.Most of the characters were forgettable.A lot of the scenes were very dark, so it was hard to tell what was going on, It was also hard to get a sense of direction and surroundings. I get that the bottom of the ocean is dark, but it made it hard to follow the ""logic"" of the characters.The pressure exerted at the depths that the characters were in would have made most of the movie impossible, so you have to just go with the flow on this one.I went into this movie with low expectations.

258,Diablo1616,Escape to the bottom of the sea.,6,29 March 2020,"Overall Underwater is an exciting and entertaining film though it is also ironically very wishy washy in it's premise, and though it seems to have a narrative, it loses its own footing as it delves deeper into its own story, leaving me as a viewer uncertain of where we started, where we were going, and where we ended.In terms of a thriller movie, overall it wasn't that bad at all. It did have it's scares, and it does have its thoughtful moments, but it is laden with tropes and unnecessary moments along with unnecessary characters.I am not sure if overall the point of this movie was pro-enviornmentalism, or pro-humanity, or love conquers all, or what, but there are several not hard to see messages that are spoon-fed to the viewer as the movie drudges on. The downside is none of these messages are driven home as characters often mention things and do things that turn out to be completely pointless later on in the film.One character even utters something along the lines of ""... this is the earth fighting back. We don't belong down here..."" As if to envoke a sense of man vs nature and nature will always prevail sort of ideology, the main character confirming her co star's view with a firm and uncontested ""She has a point.""However, by the end of the film our protagonist is blowing monsters away Ripley style in her mech suit. So what is it? The monsters are just defending their home that we're rudely entering?Or is the film more about always supporting each other, as one of the final survivors of the film had contributed to all but 3 other character deaths, and became literally incapacitated less than a quarter way through the protagonist's journey and had to be dragged for the latter portion by the survivors. There is after all a message sewn into the film's beautiful cinematography (will touch on that soon) that pushes the idea of the ""Buddy System"" after all. But, who really knows? This film sure doesn't.Outside of the glaring problems with the story, the actors ALL did a phenomenal job and we're exceptionally believable in their roles. At times our lead actress was slightly overselling her stress, and underselling her terror, but in a sense the film does allude to a bit of psychological disfunction from being ""Underwater"" *roll credits* for so long, so perhaps that's where some of the detachment came from?Aside from this though, even the film""s score was well placed and atmospheric. Much of the background noise was filled by high synths and aquatic rumblings, which fit perfectly in the deep sea tale. Furthermore, the creatures noises were very creepy and set the tone well for a believable deep sea monster without being too ""Godzilla Kaiju"" like, though we do get a bit of that later on.The organization behind the Roebuck Drilling I feel should have far more backstory than the exposition given through flashes of newspaper clips we don't have the time to read when adjusting the reclining seats and choosing the hole our cups will go into when we get in the theatre. A slower pace and a bit more showing rather than telling would have done this film wonders as it truly does have an interesting story to tell, and has an incredibly talented group of actors on board to help tell it.Underwater gets a solid 6/10 from me as while I was floored by the incompetency of some of the film, I was unable to peel my eyes away from it for 99% of the experience.Not the greatest film to start the year off with, but certainly won't disappoint anyone looking to be thoroughly entertained and thrilled for a few hours",Underwater

It is a well made underwater horror with allusions to Aliens, Deep Star Six and perhaps The Abyss.

It's been awhile since I felt this anxious watching a movie, so I certainly appreciate the direction and VFX.Unlike some other movies in this genre, the characters were mostly likeable and you appreciate they are trying to survive. The tension was palpable and within the first 15 min I was over my skepticism of Kirsten Stewart being the lead character, as she seems to have gotten over her ticks.The design and production value were great, worthy of the Alien franchise, and the creature design was effective.

In order for a leading actor to have a memorable performance you need good supporting characters. Well this movie has neither.

Basic storyline, formulaic one-by-one technique but its spotlight mostly covers on the intense escapade to find their way back to the shore. No worries, it's better than those 47 Meters movies.As everyone is wondering how Stewart performs, her acting here is not bad but not great too. It's acceptable. For a not-so-serious sci-fi film, she pulls this off quite decently. The tension is there, it's always there, and it manages to increase its intensity by styling the camera work and also the lighting effect. It does not rely fully on cheap jump scares.The best thing about Underwater has got to be its starting point. The film does not drag the movie with 30 minutes development before anything starts to occur. It goes straight to its main plot; 'survival is the key'. But here what it suffers, the development only shows its strength by half of the film and by that time, it's already too late for the audience to even give a thing about the characters.Now let's get to the slo-mo parts. They utilize this aspect quite a lot in the beginning and final 10 mins. Usually, we would get irritated by how much it sprinkles onto every scene but Underwater gets it right. And for a thriller/sci-fi, Underwater increases its thrilling factor by slowing down its motion picture. Adding to that, it looks cool.What I dislike the most is Underwater brings very little to the table. It's short with merely 90 minutes and instead of flooding the audience with many sub-stories, it leaves you feeling almost empty with only drops of information to satisfy our experience.By the final 20 minutes, you will be wondering if this is a spin-off to Godzilla. I thought the unknown species were gonna be realistically scary, but nope ,it rejects the notion to push that scary button and entertains the audience with a yet another tame PG-13 monster. But I can guarantee that the ending will not be as depressing as Life. Life has a good ending for those who want to find different satisfaction. For Underwater, it will please most of the audience thought it ends quite abruptly.Verdict: Underwater is a not-so-exciting adventure that tries to find its resources more than what other movies of the similar genre have provided, but in the end, the only thing you might find here is a sea of mineral water.",Underwater
283,olivewahh,Another one expression role for Kristen Stewart,6,3 February 2020,"With Underwater, the title doesn't leave much to the imagination, as the film starts off well... underwater. We see an exhausted Kristen Stewart with a shaved head, as she brushes her teeth in a facility bathroom on her own. While the surroundings remain silence, with a few vibrations and the occasional flickering of the lights, it isn't not long into the film where Norah (Kristen Stewart) is sent into a panic rush, as high-pressured water bursts through the walls. Leaving everything behind, Norah bolts down the halls, banging on doors to alarm crew of the danger. With no time to slow down, Norah bumps into crew member Rodrigo (Mamoudou Athie) and the two find themselves shutting themselves off from the possibility of drowning.As the two surviving members recollect their focus and thoughts, survival instincts kick in and the two squeeze their way through tight gaps to gather with fellow survivors along with the Captain (Vincent Cassel). The small group of survivors form together, and head towards a control room as they try their luck at contacting above water for help but receive an unsuccessful response. With oxygen running low, the Captain takes authority in attempt to rescue his crew, but to get to the crew to safety, they must dive lower where they discover that they're not alone out in the deep blue sea.Where Underwater lacks in backstory to where and why these people are deep down underwater. The film makes up for it with some suspenseful scenes and impressive looking graphics. However, I felt it was hard to build any connection to the characters, as we don't really learn much about them to grow any attachment to.I know I'm going to sound like a broken record here, as this has been quoted so many times prior, but Kristen Stewart struggles so hard to show more than one expression. The tone in her voice remained the same whether she was scared, angry, or happy, it was all the same. Her whole performance wasn't bad, however with Stewart being the lead role in this film, she needed to deliver more as I struggled to feel the emotions she was going through.Ultimately T.J. Miller who plays the character Paul, becomes the glue to the film with his hilarious sense of humour, his love for his rabbit plushie and strong presence on-screen.Overall, despite my criticism, I really enjoyed this film and highly recommend Underwater to fans of horror and sci-fi.",Underwater

This is coming from a guy who gave Alien:Covenant an awful review because I couldn't stand the cgi aliens.

As they attempt to escape, they are met with unfamiliar creatures and must in turn escape from them as well.This is by far the best film I've seen in terms of 2020 releases so far (though that's isn't saying much and I'm not factoring 1917 or JUST MERCY into the mix here since those are technically 2019 films). This movie was actually filmed in 2017 and just released now due to the Disney/Fox merger and it really feels like both studios didn't know what to do with this because this is better than most January releases and the filmmaking behind it is adequate. They at least try. The acting is fine, the production design and technical are all passable as well.One of my huge issues with this film is that it feels to much like Alien or Cloverfield to the point where it feels like a ripoff of those films. There are so many homages to those films that at times it became a bit distracting at times and took me out of the movie at times, causing me to zone out.I've seen things saying that the lighting is very minimal, but for the most part I thought the minimal lighting helped with the suspense of building up the creatures and the experience of the characters when they come into contact with these creatures. The only parts the minimal lighting didn't work for me was when the camera was skating all over the place and you couldn't see anything that was happening.This is one of the more decent films in January. This is by no means a great film, but there was enough that was entertaining that kept me engaged, even though it does feel like it rides that line of ripping off some classic films that clearly influenced it.",Underwater

299,kmjnhh123,"Cool Theme, But Generic Everything Else",4,14 February 2020,"The film starts off with a bang within 1 minute & boom, the plot for the film has already been set & the film starts immediately in the mining base that is slowly blowing up bit by bit. There is no story or anything lone those lines, what you have is the ending of a film in a way, its almost like Titanic without the first hour of the film, it jumps straight into the sinking stage. Which is a shame because the film has a very cool theme to it with the mining at the bottom of the ocean Marina trench with lots of cool machinery, i would of loved to see a bit more back story to do with that then followed by the blowing up phase of the film.There is no character development as it just gets on with the film, people they find along the way just tag along & don't really do anything, you don't feel sad when someone dies or doesn't make it because you know that people are gonna die along the way as fast they find new people, what gets me is that they said it has a crew size of 316 or close & the escape pods can only hold 1 person, there barely any of this pods around so how on earth did all 316 people escape.Apart from the film its self the theme & setting of the film is very good, we have a deep base at the bottom of the ocean mining for stuff, the pressure of the water is insane, the unknown is uncertain, theres deep pounding music & sounds to scare the hell outta you as you would be that far down in the sea with no guaranteed escape & no help from the outside world, your down there for months at a time with artificial light & sheer darkness outside the windows. In parts of the film they have to go outside & cross some the sea floor to get to another part of the base, them parts are really scary & totally change the feel for the film, you walk out of the base to total darkness, with these monster things roaming around that have awoken from the drilling.But behind the cool theming it is a very generic film that you knew what was going to happen, i feel like with a bigger budget it could of been much better story & character wise.Age - 25

306,michaeljpfitzgerald,"Really enjoyed what it was, but could have been special.",4,9 May 2020,"First, the bad:
Mothman ass opening credits. Genuinely looks like an X-files episode. Utterly at odds with the movie they made.Director has no idea who the adversary is/what it wants/what we're supposed to know about it, or think that it is. Not knowing this, there's nothing communicated by any of the choices, and aside from some cool ass creature design, and some absolutely gut seizing scares (which will hit extra hard if you are scared of tight spaces or of drowning), the adversary remains largely unknown the whole movie: but not in a cool, on purpose sort of way.Studio stayed out of things for the most part, but the finale is just...why? Sacrifice? Very noble. Retribution, though? Not in the cards. Director presents presence of the adversary as due punishment for humanity's transgressions pretty early on...yet someone chooses a 'let's blow this all up and take you out' finish? Didnt fit, didnt like it.The Good
Delightful cast. TJ Miller surprises, and his camp is welcome against the bleak backdrop. Kristen Stewart is terrific; she's enormously *in* the movie, and rarely seems to be acting, which is a contagious thing - her conversations with other people are rare fare for movie screens; it seems like people talking to eachother in an insane crisis. Not delivering lines. Unusual and welcome.-Kristen Stewart is so hot it's upsetting and distracting. Someone was like 'So, I heard you liked Sigourney Weaver changing into a space suit. How about that, but for forty minutes?' Weirder bc it doesn't feel lascivious, she's just absurdly fit and covered in water for a long time.
The suits/props/real sets. Feels like it came from late 80's-early 90's - the diving suits, in particular, have that uncompromised feel to them. It's a great design vision throughout, and it NEEDS it, because the movie doesnt have a good sense of place, and the sets really step up to entertain in that absence.The adversary is spooky as heck. Everything after the little one is cool as heck...though, why a super-subterranean, super-deep ocean...biped? Why do they have eyes? Nothing else down there does. Miller jokes about them looking like slenderman, and they do, which is spooky, but...bizarre? Coupled to never giving them any clear purpose, the humanoid form seems like a mistake.I'm pleased I rented it, really enjoyed it, and am probably going to check it out again - we'll see if the bad choices make a second watch unpalatable.",Underwater

The movie needs to be applauded for its underwater effects which is under the budget of 80 million but the idea of incorporating a disaster movie with a creature is worth a question. The movie doesn't offer any acting performances worth mention still Kristen Stewart somehow manages her protagonist role while Jessica Henwick looks better in her supporting role. The story had some good thrilling moments but those where too short. The movie however has a good unexpected climax with some good background music in the end. The credits newspaper clippings also offers some follow-up story in near future.The movie had some major cons which outweighs the experience itself. Most of the scenes where too dark and is guaranteed to create confusion among the audience. The CGI of the creatures at some point felt weak and unsatisfactory. The thrilling moments are less and rest of the movie feels like an underwater travel footage. The controversial bikini run adds to the con of the movie is it affects the thrilling mood of the movie.On the whole Underwater tries the same disaster movie things as usual but ends up in becoming a near average experience.Rating:58%,Underwater

321,neoclone07,"Bad, but not a total waste",5,15 January 2020,"When I first saw this movie trailer I thought with myself that it would be a total crap. And boy, I was right!
Though it is indeed a crap, it has its moments (sorta).
The problem, see, I really got a thing for monster movies. Underwater monsters? Yay, take my money and gimme a ticket!
Though I really like this kind of flick, I must review it not as a moviegoer but as a solid cinephile I think I am.
For a positive, poor Kristen and her fellow divers got no chance for a break. The action is nonstop and fast-paced. There are jump scares all through the movie (there were this guy and his girlfriend only a seat away from me and she jump-scared the whole movie). Some tension and a claustrophobic feeling is also there. The diving suits are nice, reminded me of Gears of War suits, but if you understand a little bit of what means deep diving, dude, those suits are a no go. They're 36000 feet into the abyss (which is quite accurate, as the deepest place in the oceans is the Challenger Deep), so, no way a person would be able to walk the ocean floor at this deep with such garments. It's just not plausible.
The FX are cheap. They're not bad... but you cant actually see the monsters, as in the deeps of the ocean, one cant see a feet away of his face. So the FX team didn't have much of a trouble regarding texture, lighting and other details.
Characters got no charisma, they're bland and souless, you don't get attached to none of them. TJ MIller's character is a comic relief, but by no means such enterprise would hire a person like his character to work on a scietific station. I mean, why would Nasa send Jim Carey to the Space Station? His charecter makes no sense at all. The creatures got eyes and are humanoid. It also makes no sense. There are severeal plot wholes throughout the movie.
I only recomend this movie if you're a horror/sif-fi addicted like me. Otherwise, dont waste your time.",Underwater

And this one, while slow in the first 5 minutes, goes of the rails into it fast.Set in 2050, the realistic looking deep sea tech fails catastrophically. Communication lost and all escape pods gone. The survivors stuck on a sea elevator midpoint residential station now have only the option: go down.You will feel claustrophobia out of the get go, skeptisim in the calmer parts, and paranoia as the survivors go deeper and deeper in search of means to escape the depth alone, leading to part the climax and questioning what really caused the catastrophe.Only drawback is the smalltalk when nothing is happening. Preachy, annoying or just boring and meaningless. But overall makes sense in the situation.A stronger horror film than most out there.",Underwater

331,LegendsofHorror,Movie Review: UNDERWATER (2020),10,30 April 2020,"This is the first film to come from Disney's 20TH Century Fox Merger and in my personal opinion this definitely has a franchise possibility to it. First off let me say, this film has nothing original to it. But, what it does have is a amazing amalgamation of various horror and sci-fi films placed therein and it works! While watching this I noticed a variety of great films which were brilliantly homage'd (ie. ""GODZILLA""'s opening credits, The claustrophobia of ""ALIEN"", The dread of ""EVENT HORIZON"", and the creatures are definitely something out of ""THE DECENT"" and a H.P. Lovecraft story) all in a pitch black underwater setting.Speaking of Lovecraft, many who know his writings know that its readers have a word for the cosmic horrors. That word is ""Lovecraftian"", interesting enough the company in the film is called ""Tian Industries"". There is a quote where the IA in the film says ""Welcome to Tian Industries we have big things in store for you."" In many Lovecraft stories, there are Cults or Followers which purposely try to ""Awaken"" their gods and there is a slight hint of that in this film if you look closely enough.The drilling facility in the film they are on is called ""The Kepler"" and as I write this review in the news there is a The distant world, known as Kepler-88, which is the most massive in the star system, which contains two other planets, according to a study published in The Astronomical Journal. It orbits its star every four years in an elliptical, or egg-shaped, path.
According to ""Cultists"" there is always a moon cycle as well as an alignment of stars that lead to the ""Awakening of the Elder gods"".The film is like a gnarly roller coaster. It barely gives you a chance to get comfortable in your seat before it sends you into a explosive and intense opening sequence. From the 5 minute mark until the credits roll, this film is a nonstop anxiety driven monster.The acting is well done, the underwater cinematography is top notch. The pacing is breakneck fast and done perfectly and the writing is great especially since the writing team of Adam Cozad and Brian Duffield are still new to the film community. The director William Eubank is also new to the scene with only three films under his belt, I thought he did an amazing job bringing forth the intensity and bringing Lovecraft back to the big screen. Those who are ""Lovecraftian"" fans like myself will simply love the creature and visual effects in this underwater monster romp.The film has a great cast which includes Kristen Stewart who plays Norah. She has always been a ""wooden"" actress in most popular opinion, but then again so is George Clooney. In this film, I think she shows the best emotion and really shows her acting chops. I really enjoyed her performance, she is really good at playing stoic strong women and it shows.Vincent Cassel known for ""Le pacte des loups"", ""Irreversible"" & ""Black Swan"" plays Captain Lucien carries his charisma throughout in this film and he really helps the film's intensity.T.J. Miller known for being the comedic relief in most films, some of which are ""Ready Player One"" and the ""Deadpool"" films. TJ plays Paul Abel and his contribution to the film helps add levity to the anxiety driven scenes which are constant throughout the film.John Gallagher Jr., Jessica Henwick, and Mamoudou Athie also star in this underrated underwater horror film that will keep you on the edge of your seat and your anxiety through the roof.UNDERWATER comes out on DVD and Blu-Ray on May 6th. A 4K copy has yet to be announced as of yet.",Underwater
332,MikeWright75,Didn't cut the mustard,4,29 March 2020,"This movie really tries, and nearly makes it. But there's something missing, some vital drive that never quite gets going. As a creature feature, there's nothing new to see here. It's not really sci fi, but takes place deep beneath the sea.Others have outlined the plot here, but suffice to say, I got bored halfway through and didn't care a jot about any of the card board cut out characters.I don't know what's wrong with the movie industry today. The majority of stuff just gets churned out.",Underwater

This movie is not BAD, the opening dialog with her talking is kinda annoying and wasn't needed but I can live with that. The film seems to draw inspiration from a variety of sources, one thing that I do feel is this does a better job of creating a Doom like atmosphere than that film ever did! So you should totally see it because this is in my opinion Doom underwater (mostly).The negative reviews are probably from people who loved TLJ and thought it was great so take them with a grain of salt.",Underwater

335,kaneeddy,A cliche' filled horror movie,4,26 January 2020,"Underwater, was a film I found particularly frustrating as it seems to build a nice atmosphere and do some interesting things in its opening scene, it builds a solid foundation for our protagonist played by Kristen Stewart and gives us an interesting world. The best part of this film is most definitely her performance which is very good and multi layered.However there are so many things that make this movie such a disappointment, I found most of the supporting cast particularly frustrating, especially TJ millers character who can't help but crack jokes every single line he has, even in scenes that are supposed to be emotional for all the characters involved. The film thinks its being scary but all its doing is giving you cheap jump scares through its music. Seriously every time the camera hovered over the monsters it gives us the typical jump scare music. The writing in the film is also really bad which may be a reason why most of the characters are unlikeable. This also is one of the most cliched predictable movies ever, I pretty much knew what was going to happen to every character as soon as they were introduced and it went down exactly how I thought it would. Also I noticed a lot of shaky cam and shoddy editing in scenes where the characters were being chased or attacked.Overall Underwater was a film where if the director decided to go in a different direction, highlighting the claustrophobia of being trapped deep underwater and utilising Kristen Stewart's great performance into something more involved with this concept, Underwater could have been truly great, however we are left with a typical horror movie that you have seen in many different forms over the years with one good performance and that is from Kristen Stewart.",Underwater

339,awfulketchup,Surprisingly enjoyable!,8,12 January 2020,"I had my eyes on this movie ever since the trailer had dropped, i suppressed any kind of cynicism, can you blame me? We're in 2020 and it's really hard to find a good horror flick that can strike a balance to make it worthwhile, don't get me wrong, there have been a lot of good horror flicks but for every good horror flick we might as well have fifty stinkers.But i digress, this movie isn't a stinker, not at all. It's something very familiar, maybe cliche at times but there is a ingredient in this movie that works in its favor, and i don't want to compare it to Alien, but to hell with it, i might as well.I found the acting to be strong, the characters gave me a reason to give a damn about their survival, there was enough banter and development for such a short time, i can't praise this enough, this is something that more movies should do, actual characters, not self-insert or tropes just because the plot needs it.The atmosphere was well made, maybe a bit too well for a person who suffers from Thalassobophia, so take that as you will. And i'm getting back to the whole alien comparison as this movies uses ''less is more'' approach which i'm glad it did.
Monster designs were interesting even though i couldn't see much, which i guess is the point anyway so that might be a minor complaint, but it didn't ruin the overall enjoyment for me.Final verdict: I hope to see more movies as engaging as this, so far it's the first good horror flick in 2020, that's not saying much but it's got to start somewhere. If you're a fan of Alien, you will feel right at home, if you really despise alien, yeah better watch something else.I'll give it a 8/10, maybe it's overly generous of a rating, but I'm honestly tired of seeing so many horror movies miss the point.",Underwater

Once disaster hits, there is no space to breathe, just a continuous stream of action with no tension whatsoever. There were set-pieces which, in the right hands, could have been effective but with no connection to the characters, were just tickboxes for the attrition.This movie is another example of the failure to recognise that what is imagined by the viewer can go way beyond the skills and budget of a filmmaker, something Kubrick and Ridley Scott understood when they left space for silence to do the talking, or kept their antagonist's form indistinct and vague.Pity.",Underwater

The film expresses art, it is technically flawless from the costumes of Dorotka Sapinska passing through the scenography of Naaman Marshall (art director of The Dark Knight) cinematographed by the Montenegrin Bojan Bazelli, ASC assisted by our italian Roberto De Angelis to the Steadycam (Public Enemies) last mention to the special effects of the British Moving Picture Company (MPC);so the feeling of a useless escape hunted down by the unknown is accompanied by the splendid electronic scores of the ever better Marco Beltrami (The Thing 2011, Scream) & Brandon Roberts (Soundtrack only available in digital download); Although William Eubank's UNDERWATER is influenced by masterpiece like Alien, I felt clearly a sound of the Nostromo in their main room at the beginning of the film ,but talk about infulences I still have androgynous beauty imprinted of Kristen in panties ,so to close this the most banal error that can be done is to waste time comparing this outstanding movie to the already done forgetting what is being watching; if you do it in this spirit, you can only want to see it again and again because it is a unique film, a well-written, solid Lovecraftian nightmare that keeps you going until the last implosion.",Underwater

The script was weak. Strangely, the audio was poorly mixed.

Lots of action, but the premise is unexplainable. Let's completely set aside the unexplained monster subplot for a moment in favor of other unbelievable issues.
Drilling for oil in the deepest trench in the world by a 'for profit' corporation who is building hugely expensive and unnecessarily gigantic underwater stations, complete with nuclear reactors, deep inside one of the most active earthquake faults in the world, (seriously, it's a trench because it's between two tectonic plates), that at nearly seven miles underwater it is the most hostile environment in the world? Only if there's literally no other source of oil in the world and the oil is infused with diamonds, gold, and viagra.
Plus, the writers clearly have zero understanding of nuclear power. One, a nuclear meltdown is not an explosion (the Chernobyl explosion wasn't nuclear, watch the mini-series). Two, there is no built in mechanism to deliberately cause a meltdown, everything is designed to stop one. Three, the Marianas trench might actually be the safest place in the world to have a nuclear meltdown; no water currents to carry irradiated particles to other parts of the world, and an inexhaustible supply of freezing cold water to collapse steam bubbles and remove decay heat. In fact, due to that last one, I'm not sure a meltdown would even be possible there.

I agree with people who say she can't act, it's really bad. I just can't watch any more movies with her.

On these fronts the movie fully delivers. After just a few minutes of the opening shots, the movie does not waste its time to get to business. It is my first time to see Kristen Stewart perform (since I consciously avoided watching the Twilight Series), and am amazed by her performance. She balances resourcesfulness with stoic vulnerability. Thus she leaves you worrying how she would get through the ordeal more than expecting her to kick ass or play hero. Vincent Cassel was also great and had a very commanding presence. Having seen him play villains, I am surprised that he could be such a soothing presence in face of danger. What is brilliant about the movie is somehow, they make us care. For this reason, every death, or impending danger keeps us at the edge of our seats. There is hardly any time for character development, but the movie knows what it wants and focuses more on suspense and scares. Within helmet shots, and underwater POV shots were very effective in delivering chills, a nd claustrophobia. So much so, you would gasp for breathe the same time Stewart literally gets some air to breathe. In short, Underwater is a very lean sci fi horror that delivers both slow burning, and thumping suspense. The ending also fits the tone of the movie well, so if you want to enjoy a good underwater horror, go see it.",Underwater

Because if you give it some time, each of the actors portray very different characters and they all have reasons to be loveable (yes even the stone faced Stewart). I also felt that the tone reflects the realistic feel of the emergency, which is shattered a little at the end with the sci-fi monster bit. Overall I was pleasantly surprised.

But was kind of disappointed, the movie had only a couple of scares, few claustrophobic sequences and didn't have the atmospheric thrills that one would associate with such films. The monsters were strange looking and couple of them are shown so gigantic that you wonder how they never surfaced and went undetected on earth so far. The ending is also a letdown.What works is Kirsten Stewart as the lead protagonist. She is excellent and Vincent Cassel supports in a brief role. There are few scary scenes and most of the underwater sequences are filmed very well.So, this is just another monster movie but without many thrills. Give it a miss.",Underwater
379,LansTaylor,Lame,5,9 April 2020,"I went into this movie only knowing that it was filmed in 2017 and finally being released in 2020. I know it's not the producers fault (studio changed licensing) but the fact that the movie took its sweet ole time to be released is a telltale sign that it's not going to be that good.
Anyways, on to the movie. First off, what's with the random lame slow motion? Just every once and a while they felt the need to include a slow mo shot. Second, the script was kinda meh. It didn't really flow too well, I know, I know, it's just a crew trying to get from one station to the next, how much dialogue could there possibly be? Well, if I was trapped underwater with little to no visibility, I would be communicating what I see, what's ahead, if everyone was alright, what's the plan etc etc. A lot of people are complaining about the color grading and I didn't really have too much of a problem with it. It's just a greenish hue, which kinda fits the deep underwater theme. Also, the guy who died at the beginning when his helmet cracked, why didn't he say something so they can organize another plan? I mean clearly the scientist chic was scared of going outside the station so she could've easily stayed behind and wait for the others to bring help back. I'm also curious to how much the pods can carry? Certainly two 110 lb girls can fit into one pod right? I'm sure they have plenty of workers down there that are bigger than both those girls combined. I get it, there has to be a big final sacrifice so we can have a hero.
With all that being said, I do have a few good things to say about Underwater. First off, when KStew was being eaten by that hydro predator thing, that was pretty cool how she was able to escape with the flare. I also like when she shot up the flare out into the abyss and we get a reveal of the Cthulhu. That was mega dope.
Overall, a somewhat okay film with okay action. I wouldn't recommend for people to really sit and watch but it's a good film to watch and it's airing on TNT and there's nothing else to do. Even with that, I'd still try to find something else to do.",Underwater

At least they cast a real-life comedian to deliver the bad jokes before...well, I won't give it away.
It's hilarious when you finally see the 'monster'. I mean seriously? Was their budget like ten bucks? The only decent thing. about this mess was Kristen Stewart's acting, She more or less holds this disaster together. Until...well I won't spoil it.
It's almost as big a mess as the Trump presidency...but nothing will ever be that bad.
Most of the film is closeups of faces in underwater suits. Riveting stuff.

Instead of going right into disaster of the earthquake that traps the cast in the underwater facility. Moreover, the cinematography is weak which makes it difficult to follow the under water scenes. They could have saved T.J. Millers character instead of killing him off pretty quickly into the movie. He was the most entertaining character in this movie. Also, the science was inaccurate, the smaller creatures would not be able to go between pressurizations of the inside water and outside water without exploding due to the extensive pressure of 7 miles deep under the ocean. If they had added introduction and better cinematography and corrected the science this film could have been a 7-7.5 rating overall.",Underwater
385,lmathc,A Quality Sci-Fi Thriller That Alien Would Be Proud Of,8,11 January 2020,"I love sci-fi horror movies. Alien, The Thing, Predator, and Terminator are all examples of timeless 80's classics that continue to captivate audiences. Sadly, today's movie theaters rarely see an entry in this category. That's why when I saw the trailer for Underwater, I was very interested.Underwater follows suit of its predecessors in being set in a very quiet, isolated, and claustrophobic environment. It's not the first of its kind to be set in the depths of the sea (see LEVIATHAN, THE ABYSS, etc.) but it does very well in giving the film a dark and otherworldy vibe. The musical score is phenomenal and is perfectly matched to the setting in its hauntingly beautiful chords.The cast is one of the best parts of the movie. Kristen Stewart shines as a very likeable and relatable protagonist. She's not indestructible or fearless but instead presents a realistic underdog reacting to terrifying circumstances. Her co-stars play off each other well in a way that is genuine and avoids horror movie cliches.This movie works best building tension and mystery. True, there are a few predictable jump scares here and there, but there is greatness in how Underwater chooses to not reveal everything instantly. Less is always more in these situations. The creature effects are cool and the sounds effects are intense.At the end of the day, Underwater might not be quite the monumental achievement its ancestors from decades past are, but it is intriguing, moving, and and captivating in its own right. The fact that a great sci-fi thriller like this can be made in 2020 gives me much hope for the future.",Underwater

Unless the movie is literally based on facts and true events, just enjoy it for what it is, a movie.This movie has good action, good suspense, and decent acting. It really uses the slow motion at the perfect times to be effective.With that said, they spend zero character building in the lead up.

Underwater has none of those things, shallow characters, little in the way of plot, awful CGI, nothing new under the sun.

I enjoyed the film, I thought it was a lot better the I was thinking it was going to be. Clearly it isn't as good as alien because what is? But it still a decent film, I'm not sure why it has so many negative reviews I'm going to assume it's because it stars Kristen Stewart that poor girl gets a lot of hate.

I wasn't tempted for a moment to pick up my phone and that's the best praise I can give a film these days the only negative I can say about the film is the creatures weren't the best CGI Your going to see. The film released in 2020 you would think the CGI would be much better. Other then that I thought it was good. I would say the atmosphere was the best part of the film.

The movie starts at what should've been about the halfway point; we're thrust into the story just when all hell breaks loose, with no background for the characters or the narrative. We're given no chance to become invested in either the situation or to connect with the players.2. Roughly half the film is impossible to comprehend visually, both because of the murky, muddy scenes, and because of the rapid edits. Murky also relates to the sound, where a great deal of the dialogue, especially when they're in their underwater space suits, is unintelligible.3. The antagonists are ridiculous, given that at this depth, they too would be crushed by the pressure; and The Big Boy baddie is just completely unbelievable.Kristin Stewart is clearly making a conscious move back to mainstream films, as opposed to the arty but rarely seen films she'd recently focused on, but she needs to choose better projects if her plan's going to work.",Underwater

I also think Kristen Stewart did a phenomenal job with this role and overall I think this movie gets more hate than it really deserves.The main gripes for this movie come from the pretty one dimensional story followed by the obvious paths of the movie plot. I do think that the overall suspense and presence of the creatures makes it better, but its too easy to predict what would happen next. The ending did have somewhat of a ""twist"" but I think we all know that the big creature would appear at some point and either get destroyed or take people with it.Again, this movie does not shine from a plot point, but the overall atmosphere and approach to the design gives it some much needed points.",Underwater

On this occasion the stage is a station that controls a maritime drilling 10,000 meters underwater.
I admire of the film that features characters that make decisions based on the common good, which leads them to make sacrifices or get ahead of adversity. Thinking of that kind needs this world now. I also recognize that there is a careful production, with amazing scenarios and a sound worth enjoying in the movie theater.
Even so, the pace of the movie is unstoppable, something always happens and what happens is not always understandable. The characters are introduced instantaneously, when in this movie genre is more enjoyable to know their background to suffer or enjoy who is saved or not. There are some dialogues and scenes in which we know something about them, but not enough to sustain all the time we spend with them.
The edition is made of very fast cuts, which prevents us from appreciating what the characters do to save themselves, or to die.
And there is a subplot that involves some monsters that stalk these people but I didn't feel it contributed something relevant to the main plot and you don't even know what those things are. It could have been just a disaster movie without having that unnecessary part of the monsters.
And in the end, we came to appreciate the character of Kirsten Stewart more, but his destiny is uncertain, and that frustrated me.

Instead of feeling tense you just feel confused because you can't actually see what's going on.Another thing that annoys me to NO end with any movie is: the lack of character development.

I almost wonder if it was originally in that series, but they disconnected from that following the lukewarm reception of Cloverfield Paradox.Whatever the case, I wish it had just kept the cause of the disaster unknown. It is a decent near-future underwater survival film and I think alien-like predator detracts from that with cliche moments.

There is no character development, and there's an awkward subplot concerning the captains dead daughter that just... doesn't go anywhere. At a certain point, as long as a movie is enjoyable, there's no harm in focusing on style over substance.I also don't get the criticism that the movie is unoriginal. When is the last time you saw a film that didn't borrow story points or ideas from other movies? Yes, Kristen Stewart is doing her best Ripley from Alien impression. Yes, other films have depicted aliens/creatures along the ocean floor. And unfortunately the movie won't win best original screenplay at the academy awards, but I generally watch movies looking for a fun time and try to leave my prejudice at the door.The part of the film that worked the least for me was TJ Miller. Any tension in a scene is completely undone by him shooting off some dumb quip or the camera turning to him to catch a ""funny"" expression. Much like all of his other roles, Miller is there to spout off one liners and have an incredibly punchable face.

Basically 'Alien' crossed with 'Quarantine' set on the bottom of the Pacific. Though the movie has zero Lovecraftian qualities, the megalithic monster is as good a Cthulhu as we can ask for, however (typical of CG monstrosities) scenes are too dark and too close up to make out appreciable details. Performances are smothered by the instantaneous catastrophe at the very start of the movie; characters are in crisis mode throughout with no opportunities for emotion or arch to shine through. The unrelenting panic and tension makes the few moments of cynical comic relief feel grossly inappropriate. The 'sci' in the sci-fi is also drowned out by monotonous panic; characters hurriedly press buttons, rewire circuit boards, and hop in and out of atmospheric diving suits without conventional exposition for the layman viewer. Not fully seeing the creature proved a severe strength in 'Alien', but not knowing what characters are doing or why makes it hard to follow any film. Look out for Neil deGrasse Tyson's scathing fact-checks soon.If you want a deep-sea thriller with fantastic story, bold characters, and edge-of-your-seat panic, check out 1989's THE ABYSS.",Underwater

The rest of the characters are secondary, either their to be saved or to fall away and provide emotional heft to the drama.
The reason for all the trouble ?
Basically Godzilla or Chthulu has been awoken and is mightily pissed off.There were some irritations... The type of structures shown couldn't survive at the depths they were supposedly at and the prospect of a power suit being able to withstand pressures at that level are doubtful.
Still some of the depth effects were horrible and spectacular.I did hope that someone would use a suit as power armour (Warhammer 40k style) but sadly it wasn't to be .. apart from an one brief encounter towards the end.Overall a fun popcorn movie, not worth overthinking.",Underwater

I already wasn't expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised it was far better than I was expecting. Probably Kristen Stewart's best film since Panic Room. I wouldn't exactly call this a horror film. More like a sci-fi suspence thriller. There were some plot holes and the people that should have died don't. Then they have story fillers at the end rolling with the credits explaining the outcome of the entire ordeal leaving it completely side open for a sequel with entirely new cast and characters except for maybe the few unknowns that survived.

However, it's because we can't pretend a lot of other movies exist that I have to see this one as derivative of many, many others: Alien, The Abyss, Leviathan (which was another ""Alien""-But-Underwater ripoff), etc.Its production values are good, and Vincent Cassel is always fun to watch, but I've seen this same story many times.",Underwater

I wanted to give this title a 6.5 because it wasn't really that bad... What I really appreciated and what really bothers me about most sci-fi movies, is that there weren't that many slow moments. The action starts almost immediately and is non-stop. There aren't too many scenes where characters stand around and look at each other meaningfully while the disaster happens all around them. So many movies nowadays are full of those. It kept me guessing - I was never sure whether the main character Norah was going to be the only survivor or were others going to make it a swell. Or maybe they were all doomed? And even though I'm no expert on deep water drilling, I don't think there were too many scientific goofs, at least nothing that made me think, ""no way!"" and jarred me out of the experience. So, I actually enjoyed the movie except at the end I was left wanting to know more about the creature. Where did it come from? What was it? What was its relationship of the smaller, human-like creatures? I wanted to know!
Favourite moment: the tunnel where it's caved in and dips under water, Norah says: ""I'm the smallest, I'll check it out."" The deep dive suits are all the same size, Sherlock!",Underwater

There are some obvious drawbacks though: it gets to the point right from the get go. In fact, so fast that you don't care about any of the characters. The movie is also cut and shot in a way that half of the time you can't tell what the hell is actually going on.

453,westerfieldreviews,"""The Deep Sea Hike""",5,12 January 2020,"William Eubank's claustrophobic subaquatic disaster film succeeds in reeling audiences into its uncomfortable world of darkness and fear. From Ravi Bansal's brilliant art direction to Marco Beltrami's anxiety inducing score, to Dorotka Sapinska's amazing costume design that perfectly fuses modern-day tech with rich sci-fi elements; ""Underwater"" assembles an all-star team to create a fascinating world ripe for exploration and discovery. Unfortunately, due to its rushed plot, spotty writing, and hasty character development, for all of the great audio and visual pieces presented, it all winds up feeling just a tad bit shallow.The opening credits of ""Underwater"" quickly catch the viewer up to speed with the kinds of operations that are being conducted. A company by the name of Tian Industries has begun drilling several miles deep into the bottom of the Mariana Trench in search of a variety of resources. It is here where we board the Kepler 822 Station and meet our primary protagonist in Norah Price (Kristen Bell). We hear her discuss the psychological issues brought about when being several miles under the sea, when suddenly, catastrophe strikes causing a segment of the station to become ruined. From here on out, Norah traverses the station meeting up with a few allies along the way. When her crew is fully assembled, Captian Lucien (Vincent Cassel) takes charge and determines that their only chance of survival is to walk along the ocean floor until they reach Roebuck Station 641, another facility located just a mile away. The crew equip their gear and embark on a mile-long walk across the seafloor all while being hunted by an unknown aquatic creature that stalks them every step of the way.""Underwater"" features a premise that is sure to make any thalassophobe panic. Sadly, the premise alone is the only frightening quality of the film. This is caused by a couple of major issues; the first being, the writing, and characterization. Within the first five minutes of the film's ninety-minute runtime, the audience is instantly thrust into the disastrous action of ""Underwater""; it is at this point where you will know exactly what kind of a ride you are in for. The film tosses you right into the deep end (which is not inherently a bad thing) before establishing any core elements of the plot. Adam Cozad and Brian Duffield pen the script and create a handful of characters that we as the audience are expected to care for; we don't. This issue stems from the fact that the film never takes the time to establish any of our central characters; we know nothing about them and are instead spoon-fed key details through forced dialogue as events are rapidly flashing before our eyes. The characters appear as nothing more than vessels for the plot to continue onward, as the little characterization we do get from each member of the crew, is lackluster and dull. Everyone is here as all of the characters embody an archetype we have all seen before; Norah, the team's glue, Lucien, the hard-nosed leader, Emily Haversham (Jessica Wenwick), the frightened, yet optimistic rookie, Liam Smith (John Gallagher Jr.), the level headed focused one, Paul Abel (T.J. Miller) the funny guy, and Rodrigo Nagenda (Mamoudou Athie), the nervous and sporadic one. Every character is defined by a singular trait, that to the film's credit, they never lose sight of. However, because of the surface leveled nature of these characters, you will either enjoy them at the start or grow to loathe them in the end. Another note that should be mentioned, is that every member of the crew already has a pre-established relationship (once again this is not inherently a bad thing) which means that the writers must properly ""sell"" these character dynamics to us; tragically, they do not. The crew is presented to us as being friends, but because we as the audience have no prior knowledge of how or why they are friends, we can not reasonably buy into their friendships since it feels all to forced. It is a shame because the ensemble cast does their best, but could have done something great, instead, they are forced to read dialogue that does the bare minimum. The disconnect we have with these characters continues to haunt the story during nearly each and every one of its emotional beats. On the plus side, our small crew of characters all remain constant in both their actions and words throughout the entirety of the film.""Underwater"" suffers from another major issue that holds the film's potential back. All of the marketing leading up to the release of the film put forward this concept that it would be an underwater thriller; the marketing department did not lie. However, it's just not very scary. With the exception of a few POV shots quickly showcasing the creepy cryptid, the film feels more action-oriented than anything. Every time the film prepares to show off the lurking beast, it does so by ratcheting up the score and blaring a foreign sound for nothing more than a boring jump scare, every scare is laughably predictable. What makes this even worse, is that early on in the film, the monster is displayed in a manner that truly makes it seem like a terrifying threat, which in some regards it actually is. But, ultimately this cthulhuesque movie monster feels like a glorified nuisance that will sadly be forgotten.""Underwater"" is a film that personally bothers me. The costume design, the creature design, and even the set design are more than exceptional. Eubank's camera work shows a true brilliance in how to establish tension while also displaying a profound beauty within the film's dark atmospheric world, as he and Bojan Bazelli work in flawless tandem to exhibit some genuinely awe-inspiring moments. Yet, on the other hand, when inspecting the film's narrative, you will find a flimsy story that feels uninventive. These two conflicting elements make this film a jumbled bag. If you wish to have fun and view an atmospheric thriller, ""Underwater"" is for you. If you are searching for anything else, you would be better served looking elsewhere. Aside from the less than stellar writing, I found myself enjoying this film far more than I had anticipated, and I would certainly say it is worth the watch.Final Verdict: C+",Underwater

I think its missing a sense of purpose, and its also a bit rushed even with a standard run time.The actors do a nice enough job. No characters are annoying. Even T J Miller keeps cool for his portion of the movie.The sense of clostraphobia and being alone in the dark plays really well here. There's a suffocating feeling created throughout many parts of the movie. I give credit where its deserved in this case.All things considered though, the movie just has an inadequate quality. Maybe the plot is undersold. Maybe the characters are underdeveloped. Maybe the protagonist/ monster relationship is paper thin. I'm just not sure where the movie falls short. It falls distantly short of the Abyss. I will say that of all of the Abyss copycats, this one might have moved to the top of that group.Underwater isn't going to leave the viewer with much once the credits roll, but its still a good watch.",Underwater

458,priyadarshanmaity98,The walking dead,8,28 April 2020,"Ohh mann this film really got into my nerves. This is one of the most chilling sci fy horror I have seen in recent times. Right from the start the sense dread gets gradually ascends and then we get immersed in this survival/scy fy/horror film. Mind you this film while watching you will feel I have seen this type of movies aliens maybe, you are absolutely right about that hell they even managed to give a tribute to that movie which is frankly scary. So what's new, for me the conspiracy angle of the story while sparse really creates a realistic world building maybe there is something in the unknown in this movie that is Mariana trench. The Mariana trench is again a fascinating thing in the world it is so deep that's getting a gist of it will definitely make someone scared. This movie is so claustrophobic and tensed that you are hooked right with the characters. Bojan bazelli's cinematography captures some of the striking shots in this film especially the close up shots and the whole closed marines ship beautifully, even if it's a disturbing horror you get the sense of beauty in this film. The underwater sequences are beautifully realized cause you have to maintain the mistyness of the deep ocean and yet it should be clear to the audience and the dop department nails it. The ost is brilliant there are some rock ballads and tensed music and jarring noises makes an effective sight and sound experience. William Eubank have experience in this genre of scy fy and in this third attempt he is very confident in showcasing the dread. The story moves fast and there are very little camaraderie but makes sense cause you have to finish the line cause it is a race against time situation there is no time to have a rousing conversation which I feel will be unnecessary so there are emotional moments but they are brilliant, you really care for the characters and will always think that there should be zero casualties. Kristen Stewart, Jessica henwick, Vincent Cassel, Stephen Callagher jr, Tj Miller,Mamoudu athie gives there absolute best performance in this film. And coming to the extraterrestrial monstrosity in a good sense they are creepy and lethal at the same time they had there supernatural qualities and animals instincts and the amalgamation of both these things creates a terror inducing creatures hatts off to the vfx team. This movie is one of the most underrated gems of this year cause this has some of the most unacceptable negative reviews I don't get it.

460,angelkitteh-32778,Could have been a lot better,5,9 July 2020,"I will not be comparing this film to others like Aliens. Aliens is by no means an original film. Its concept is likely inspired or copied from older films or literature. So saying such film copy another 'copy' from another film and so on and so forth is meaningless.This film could have been great if there were more character developments or a more wholesome script or direction. It felt like we were thrown into the midst of a long but typical escape-from-creature 'sequence' and that was all there is to it.The cast choices were quite poor. While Kirsten Stewart is somewhat suitable for a strong female protagonist role (with perhaps a degree of apathy), the lack of facial expressions (mainly fear) erases a lot of the urgency and tension from the scenes. But even so, I still find her overall acting quite decent in this film and it is not far fetched to say that she did carry some bits of this film to some degree (especially towards the end). But then again, it probably would have been better if the role was given to another actress.T.J. Miller on the other hand was totally unsuitable for this role, either him or how they dictate his character to be. You want to set the theme/mood towards a certain direction in order for the audiences to immerse in it. Adding a clown into the middle of a supposedly tense and horror film will not make it better.Best part of the film is undoubtedly the creatures themselves, the destruction, the suits and the environment so kudos to the VFX team. Though with most of the scenes being so dark we cannot marvel at all the digital assets produced.All in all, a slightly weak direction and cast choice hindered this film's potential.

463,faerlian,Why the hate on Kristen Stewart?,8,21 February 2020,"What's not to like? I got exactly what I was hoping for. A thrilling, high-production-value horror-suspense movie, that is honestly pretty good even from an objective standpoint.People rating this a 6 and under are honestly just cynical about Kristen Steward having the lead role. Did Cloverfield explain where its monsters came from? Basically no, right? This movie has about the same depth of exposition in that regard, if not a bit more. Sometimes a full-on backstory isn't necessary.When I saw the trailer, I was like, ""Yes! This actually looks good, I want to see it!"" I'm glad I did.It's not exactly a terribly original story, but if you saw the trailer, you knew that. It's not derivative, lazy or uninspired by any means.With regards to acting chops, lets be honest. I'm no Kristen fanboy, but very few actors and actresses are on the level of Leonardo DiCaprio or Michael Caine. Her acting was fine, and I had no gripes with it. I would see more of her in future roles like this if I am quite honest. She has improved from her Bella Swan days. The rest of the cast was also good to great, especially the Captain.With regards to the science of it all, I'm pretty sure that any kind of suit for use on the sea floor, especially at that depth, would have to have some sort of hydraulic exoskeleton in order for people to move around at all, period, due to the immense water pressure. But, the suits are big and sturdy enough to where you can reasonably assume that the hydraulics exist within the suit. It's not a big deal. They got the compressed, specially liquefied air canisters right, so I'm happy.There are some actual  moments. Effects are great, slow-motion effects are done properly, and the mood and tone of the film is nicely foreboding.Give it a shot, unless you've already typecast Kristen to the point of no return.",Underwater

466,Neucosa,Ok action and suspense without much of anything else,4,26 May 2020,"There's really no script in this movie. There is action though and lots of darkness. There's about 5 minutes of movie prior to the climax of the film which lasts pretty much the rest of the film. There isn't much character development or story to speak of. It's mostly just wondering who of the stereotypical characters are going to live or die given the circumstance they've fallen into after the first 5 minutes.
It might be interesting to see a precursor to this movie, but this movie is kinda meh.",Underwater
467,ricardomartins_thesecond,Lame,5,9 April 2020,"I think we can all agree we don't need any more Kristen Stewart playing the sexy, emotionally struggling character anymore. Please, enough of this role. Secondly, the sci-fi bits of the movie are that a drill is underwater, and the drill station's interiors are ""sci-fi-y"", like something in outer space kinda of deal. I appreciated all 5 or 6 seconds of shots that appeared throughout the hour and a half long movie. Lastly, the ending was not in-tune with what ""the scientist"" brought us to consider. Nothing new in this movie. Just an older Kristen Stewart, and underwater setting for ""things gone wrong and there's a monster"". Because of course there is a monster, otherwise where would the agency be. And a lot of walking. And stopping. And walking. And ""oh no, he died"". What a waste. Looked like this was made in the 90's. Trope movie. :/",Underwater

They drilled too deep and woke the presence of sea creatures and have to walk on the ocean floor to each the safe point and get out safely.So my friend and I wanted to see a fun movie to watch over the weekend and we decided to see this. Expecting it to be ""ok"", we were pleasantly surprised by the quality and content of the film. When the film was over, we looked up the budget for the film and were surprised!! This movie had a lot of jump scares (some may be unneeded) but still enjoyable. I like how they didn't waste any time and got started right away. This movie was definitely no slow burn, in fact the complete opposite. I personally think that they tried to cramp too much in this film, for nothing slowed down. Everything was fast paced and intense, I think this is the most intense PG-13 I've seen in a while. (But for parental guidance- this might pass as an R rated movie so beware, it had a lot more blood/gore than I thought and cussing )But if you have spare time willing to spend on the movies, go check this out, it's a fun movie to watch for a good time.",Underwater

Yes, it does have problems, a lot of it has been done before, and the giant monster is basically a deep sea version of the Cloverfield monster. If you're someone with a legitimate fear of deep bodies of water however, I think this movie may hit you a little harder than others.Yes, the jump scares are excessive. Truth be told though, if it were myself down there in the depths, I would jump if a harmless fish swam by my face. When you're that far under, everything is scary, and I think that's what the movie was trying to emphasise. I also admit there are a few scenes that are slow and the camera is set on something difficult to see, or when it gets eerily quiet and you're almost counting on a jump scare. However, there was one specific angle where one of the wendigo-like creature charged at the camera in a spiral motion, and even though it made me jump, I still said ""Okay, that was pretty cool"".And since I've already spoiled a bit, I was not expecting that punch in the final minutes. I know I probably wasn't supposed to find it so funny, but I couldn't help but laugh at it.I genuinely enjoyed the sets and surroundings of this film. I thought Kristen Stewart did a great job, the other actors did fine as well. Conceptually it's a pretty basic survival story, and while elements of this film have been done before, I still think they come together nicely to make a pretty neat film.

I was taken by surprise!! It was entertaining, it had the potential to prod against the big budget sci fi movies out there. ""Kristen Stewart was good in this one"" , i barely got any chance to make that statement in the entire life. Visuals were in the league of big budget productions, nothing groundbreaking though but they kept it to a level of their capacity, which was sufficient for me.

The underwater stations layout is briefly hinted at the start of the movie but we never really get a sense of space or atmosphere. There are no windows or anything to hint at that we are in fact deep deep under water. Movies like ""The abyss"" and ""Sphere"" do a great job in this regard, you can really feel the pressure of being that far deep under water.Compared to the other movies I have mentioned this movie rarely introduces anything. Things just kind of happen. Kristen Stewart meet some new characters along the way, none of them are likeable or interesting - neither is she.In ""The abyss"" we get a real sense of the people in the deep sea rig. I could not tell you their names but I could tell you what they where about. In this movie they barely seem to know each other by name, why doesn't anyone care about characters anymore? It is the single most important part of a film.You can have a great film with bad plot if it still has great characters, you can't get a great film if you have a great plot but poor characters - no matter how many explosions you have.I am sad that I did not like this film, because this is a genre I really enjoy, no matter the budget - if the film is good then B-movie or not, I will gladly watch it.""Underwater"" is a mess, and I blame the writers and directors for the lack of core understanding of what makes this genre great.

You didn't have time for much character love, but the pacing kept you moving along.Thank god it didn't suffer from one character dragging the whole film down with an unnecessary affliction. I saw Stewart as brave, stressed to extremes, and brilliant in this role, exemplifying true empowerment thru her decisive actions in crisis.I couldn't be more happy with a movie...it had everything, from being super entertaining, to terrifying, to really making me think about it, far after it ended.

However I quite enjoyed this film for what it was.Its gets into the action very quickly which is both a pro and a con. For a 90 minute film which seems unusual in the sci-fi genre it means theres lots of time for the action. However, this sacrifices the character backstories. We dont really know who these characters are as people so any catastrophe that occurs lacks a real impact.Kristen Stewart seems to be a bit like marmite with audiences - some like her and some dont. Her performance here i think is actually really good. She has a final girl attribute here (not a spoiler) in order to survive and she does a pretty good job. The rest of the cast is ok but its Stewart who in the most interesting to watch.Amidst the few cool action sequences and very few yet effective jumpscares, the story itself as to what is happening is a bit lost. In the end it sort of just came down to accepting it was a survival film and the reasoning of why they are there becomes irrelevant.Overall, pretty enjoyable popcorn movie.",Underwater

479,captgage-1,"Derivative, But Competent",7,5 February 2020,"Underwater not only goes about 7 miles to the ocean floor, but where many sci-fi/horror movies have gone. Movies about an isolated group of people in peril from a monstrouos presence or presences have been done at least The Thing back in the 1950s. Alien hit it big in 1979 with the theme, jumpstarting the trend. This type of movie will be done over again indefinitely.Underwater is the latest variation on a theme from Fox, which was recently bought out by Disney. As the movie was reportedly shot back in 2017, it's believed that Disney didn't care about it and released it when it did. At any rate, we've got a likable enough crew who have to abandon their deepsea drilling station when disaster strikes. And it strikes almost immediately, giving the film a fast start. Director Bill Eubank's camera quietly explores the interior of the station for a short time before catapulting Stewart and crew into peril. The captain is a caring and brave soul who has to decide on the best course of action for evacuating the station and trekking to safetly with whatever's left at his disposal..As anyone who's seen the previews knows, the main obstacle confronting the humans is a school of previously-undiscovered life forms with lots of razor-sharp teeth. The movie by now has settled into the who-dies-and-who-lives formula.Eubank milks enough mileage out of a simplistic, no-frills storyline as Underwater moves along. the pacing is well-handled, not too fast and not too slow, as the token funny guy and the rest of the crew bravely press on. The characters briefly mention a detail or two of their lives outside of work: family, lost love and little else. Characterization isn't a major thing in Underwater, but it's worth checking out at a bargain theater or a matinee.",Underwater

I'm a big fan of Kristen Stewart. She and the rest of the cast really brought it.
Spoilers below:One interesting thing was that (unless I'm mistaken) the actors who played Smith was also in 10 Cloverfield Lane, and while they aren't from the same franchise, Underwater and the Cloverfield films have some related topics and similarities.Now, I'm not oceanographer, but I do enjoy watching documentaries and the like about strange animals and creatures of the sea, so just generally I thought the creatures to be at least a little unrealistic. Specifically that they had working, *light sensitive* eyes. Baring these being creatures from another world, it simply wouldn't make sense for deep sea creatures to have functioning eyes (unless they do go up into higher waters and we just don't know that). In my opinion, a little more research on the types of fish and life that exists in deep water would have been good to really bring about something that felt a little more plausible while still be terrifying. I have plenty of notes but I have them because I enjoyed the film and, if for some reason was given the chance, would love to really make it top notch.In the end, I think it's a fun action flick, if a little too light on personal details.",Underwater

Quite honestly it has been both that movies don't last that long in the theaters and I've been busy, and the fact that nothing looks good anymore.I mean really. They just don't make movies like they used too. I was seeing TRANSPORTER 1 (film from 2002) back in the fall, and I even said to myself.....there's something different about this film. It's just the feel. And I said to myself....movies these days are so different.This movie though looked remotely good and interesting, so I decided to go see it.But it was not that good. It didn't suck....but I don't think I'll be buying it.This movie reminded me a little of THE MIST (2007), only this film was better....but not a whole lot....but definitely better.I did have to leave to use the restroom at one point, so I don't know if I missed a crucial scene or not.There aren't many people in this film...only seven...I think.The film does pretty much get to the point right at the start and is only 95 minutes instead of these whiny 2-2.5 hour films these days. Although the end credits music was whiny.Gosh music these days.....it's only going to get worse.So....the real problem is that .... they never explain what happened ... (other than they drilled too deep under the ocean and these monsters were released) the survivors are denied interviews..... and only 2 survive.Like why couldn't two fit in a pod at the end? Maybe there wasn't enough room. I don't know. But the one that was broken .... I wish she could have fixed it.Maybe there is a DVD coming with an alternate ending.Kristen Stewart is the main character and she dies....but yet still narrates at the end.....so maybe there's a sequel coming....maybe she survives....and maybe again she survives an alternate ending.By the way, Kristen Stewart has blond hair in this film...instead of her brown hair on the imdb picture here....but then again she did have blond hair in PANIC ROOM.She looks odd here....almost reminds me of a cross between that evil dude from RED 2 and Ethan Hunt from MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 1. I'm not saying she looks bad...actually rather funny....from the description I mentioned.Also the black guy dies first....I'm not black btw....but I guess I got really distraught over it becomes he reminds me of a friend. But I guess if they killed the fat guy first...people will whine, always the fat guy gets it first.I'm not saying this movie is awful.....it does have it's cool moments and it was fun.....but I was expecting a better ending.Also this is not a film for kids at all under 13.

It reminded me of the awful 'AVP Requiem' another movie that was very hard to see what was going on, as these 2 films are similar as it's so dark and murky throughout you find it hard to actually see much of what is happening. With the catastrophic failure of the station at the very beginning, there's not much else for the characters to do apart from heavy breathing, getting in and out of diving suits and pressing buttons. With the amount of money spent on this movie, estimated around $80,000,000!

Yea, there's literally zero character development, as a matter of fact I don't think I've ever seen a movie with no character development at all besides one or two sentences of character intro.

I watched the trailer for it, decided to watch it and I was not disappointed.The 2/10 critics say there was no back story. You should have been watching he first 2 minutes instead of fiddling with your phone or arranging your drink and popcorn. That was the back story.5/10 critics say there was no let up. There were, but when mayhem is going on all sound you I'm pretty sure they would be few and far between. I was paced perfectly IMHO. Anyway. I expected a roller coaster and I got one. Would you expect breathing space if your deep sea drilling platform suddenly blew up? No pun intended there.For those who haven't seen it. Don't go in expecting a long drawn out film like the abyss (which in my opinion is a masterpiece of film making). But it's pretty much 3 hours long (extended version). This is a short 1hr 30min high octane action flick with a creature to boot. It all makes sense. The acting is very good. The effects are excellent. The script is perfectly good, the direction is fabulous, the technical aspects are brilliant considering the complexity of making films in water, the creature is frightening, the end is surprising and good. It keeps you glued to it for the entire time. The editing is perfect. Those that thought it was boring clearly missed salient information as they were distracted with their own stuff and as a result didn't feel it hung together well. I kind of understand gay in Coronavirus world you might be watching on your TV. Yes. You need a projector and 120inch screen for films like this else they look dark and you don't necessarily get the full effect. Don't be fooled by 4K 75 inch screens. Still way too small.

The actors and the roles they play feel like genuine, regular people. There are no heroes that lead the way, but heroic actions on the part of everyday workers caught in rapidly deteriorating and deadly situation.It's no secret there are creatures in this film. This movie is not trying to be Aliens, where the titular organism is as horrifying as it is fascinating. I would compare this more to Frank Darabont's The Mist, as it is less about an enemy being hunting down our human cast, and more about humanity unwittingly coming to brush against an alien ecosystem that, by nature (and not design) just happens to be incredibly deadly to us.

Why are these delusional gender stereotypes still displayed? Who enjoys them? Maybe I am just not the targer group here?At least Kristen's character has a mind of her own and sort of makes her own decisions once in a while. At least after someone else gave her options to choose from. I give a thumbs up for that punch at the evac capsules though.

Although, I don't rule out that such a murky picture could have been the idea of the authors.Plus the film - it constantly keeps in tension and doesn't allow to be distracted from itself. It's true. But the plot is not very original, there is no minimal background.The cast coped with their task, playing at the level of the film - not great, but good.In general, the film is not so terrible to have such a low rating.

It is beautifully shot, the underwater scenes are credible, the CGI is of good quality, etc. It could have done a few things better though.The pace is way too fast. Not even 5 minutes into the movie and characters are already running around and screaming in panic, stuff explodes (or rather implodes) left and right and this pace doesn't change ever again over the course of the whole movie. There is no time for character development or depth, at least not that you'd start caring for the cast.Also there are quite a few plot holes and logic fallacies. For instance:-How did the creature, who ate Abel in the tunnel, even get in there, from a high pressure environment into a low pressure environment, without collapsing the whole facility?Why did Cpt.

The scene where they are getting into the suits has the Jessica Henwick sitting on the ground being comforted by another character .
You can see she already removed her pants and gotten ready to get into the suits.

That was a sci-fi thriller; this movie is sci-fi horror. Imagine a modernized version of Deep Star Six and Leviathan (both also released in 1989) but this movie's plot begins when everything is literally coming apart. I think this was intentionally done to grab and keep your attention as horror movies often start slow and build up suspense.Throughout the movie, you wonder what exactly is happening and who or what is responsible for the catastrophic damage to the station. Because it doesn't waste time with horror at the beginning, don't expect character development. I think they did fine establishing everyone's job and easy-to-deduce area of expertise and mini-backstory.Honestly it's not that bad considering there hasn't been a decent aquatic horror movie in a while (that doesn't involve sharks) and takes place deep under water.If you decide to watch it, don't expect James Cameron-caliber cinematic precision and just enjoy it!",Underwater

The director was able to capture the emotions of the actors well and it's editing was spot on. The CGI was pretty good as well.As the movie basically brings the audience to follow a group of survivors who experience a sudden mysterious disaster (as seen in the movie trailer) , some might find this movie lacking of backstory or explanation as the characters were clueless on the events that transpired.However, I found the mystery and lack of exposition worked well in this production, giving me a sense of being part of the survivors and understanding their frustration on figuring out what is going on and how to escape this disaster, as the creepy horror stuff unfolds.",Underwater

And these are all good threads to follow in an underwater action/horror flick. instead, movie doesn't even bother with those aspects ever again and focus on ripping of ailen (unsuccessfully).this movie didn't need any ailens, underwater pressure was an obstacle enough. If we get to know who these characters are and what were their inner conflicts we as the viewer would care much more about the people dying than we did. and our main character didn't have any inner conflict or any mistakes that we know of so we can root for her to get her redemption. People in the reviews talk a lot about stewarts acting but even if you cast the most talented actress on the planet on that role, what does she have to go on? she had a boy friend who is lost while diving? oh god.. what a lazy story that creates more questions than answers, in fact here are my questions:If her boyfriend died while diving, why did she choose this job?
Did her boyfriend dying had no effect on our hero?
Why should we as viewers care about this boyfriend while we never saw their relationships? ...In short, I would care about this movie much more if it started with whole cast interacting with one another, get to know them and feel sorry for them when they die.

Admittedly I did jump, reacting to the intended jump scare, even though i knew what was coming..that's a good thing, it shows I was enjoying the movie.What's normally offputting in movies of this type are the incredibly moronic decisions made by the characters and it was pleasing to see a certain awareness of this by not doing stupid things. I found that a very stand out point of the movie....the characters weren't idiots and their decisions, for the most part, were sensible and within reason under the circumstances..unusual or what!!!I was a bit let down by the order of on screen deaths, but that's a minor and I suspect more of a personal choice as to whom should be done away with first, but for me that is a small gripe for what is otherwise a really great yarn.Nods to Alien and Lofcraftian horror, namely Cthulhu are apparent and as I'm a fan of both made this even more of a treasure that I shall definately watch again, might even add it to my physical collection, as a rare treat that it is....a decent, well shot, claustrophobic, itch inducing and well paced sci-fi horror .I do hope we see more movies like this, because this touched on themes that I totally enjoy and make me feel phobic at the same time. This isn't Leviathan or Abyss, which in my opinion were completely tame, this is true creature feature and I recommend turning the lights off, cranking up the volume and enjoy this 1 hour, 40 odd minute bundle of joy.For all I've said, that's why Underwater gets a solid 9/10 for me, as I deducted a star for the order of deaths and making me jump once, just so I could say something negative.Looking at the some of the reviews here, I can understand, to a degree why some people didn't like it, but I guess this is a movie that appeals to fans of the genre.

543,zhenwenho,Just Pure Fun,6,18 January 2020,"My Rating:
6.5/10
A January movie, the dumping ground of Hollywood studios each and every year where at times there are a few surprises here and there but for the most part, it's usually just trash. Underwater is by far from a January movie, I went into the theater with no expectations whatsoever and to my surprise, this movie delivers on various notes and is surprisingly incredibly entertaining.
Well, the plot is simple, you have seen it a hundred times with movies such as Aliens and even the Meg in terms of the underwater sea creature element which was honestly a fairly enjoyable but all in all a pretty bland movie. But yes, the movie wastes no time with character building and cuts to the chase thus, I would say that this movie is entirely carried by the atmosphere created and also the acting. It is definitely not a story driven movie nor is it one with much character building moments.
Previously as I believe many of us have, the only movie I have seen Kristen Stewart act in was in the Twilight series; yes, THAT series and yes, I have heard from others that she was actually a good actor with her taking part in various indie films which aren't shown in Malaysia. So, I must really praise her acting here, it is nothing iconic whatsoever but her ability to communicate the sense of fear and dread that she is feeling whilst crossing the ocean's floor is truly mesmerizing in a weird sense, and this is also due to the director, William Eubank as I believe, the acting was above par for a movie such as this., so all credits to him for getting the best out of the actors with what they were given to work with.
Given the estimated budget of this movie ranging from 50-80 million USD budget, and where this movie is intended to take place, a thousand leagues under the sea, they did an incredible job with the budget given. The CGI is fairly serviceable and believable, and this is mainly due to the fact that the entire movie takes place at such low lighting depths where the SFX team were able to hide the CGI in the darkness. There are indeed certain scenes where you could notice the obvious CGI which is the walk on the sea bed where there is the whole floating heads issue whilst they are in their suit. Kind of the issue certain individuals had when the Iron Man suits became more dependent on CGI rather than actual costumes.
There's nothing much to talk about for this movie, it is a fun one where certain scenes will leave you at the edge of your seat. with a runtime of 1 hour and 35 minutes, this is a pretty good movie and I would recommend this movie for those whom want to fill that 'I want to watch a good January movie' void that they have going on.",Underwater

The underwater suits that the main crew uses look completely real and when they're underwater the camerawork works, unless it's an action scene.Alright, enough being nice, time for what I didn't like. First of all, this may be the first movie where I hated the sound mixing. I could barely hear half of the dialogue because it was 'drowned' out by sound effects or an inappropriately used score. That's the main reason I didn't really have a good time during this movie, because I had no idea what was going on. Also, the camerawork and editing when it's not wides, was not very good and it helped me not understand even more of the movie.Overall, I was expecting a good horror sci fi, but I got a decent sci fi that wasn't scary.

Exactly what I was hoping for. Thrilling, terrifying, and claustrophobic; this movie doesn't let up for a minute. Have you ever watched a movie and thought that they should have trimmed 20 minutes? This is NOT that! All heart-pounding tension and no filler. I'm not gonna say too much about the sea creatures. I'll just mention that there was one scene in particular that was straight out of a nightmare! Monsters aside, the cinematography was also great.

Is it totally original, or a piece of cinematic gold, no, it's not. It definitely borrows many themes from past films of similar stories of its kind, but it also includes new twists and what not within those borrowed themes. But it's a fun, creepy, suspenseful movie that kept me engaged in it the entire run time. Its even got some pretty good humor mixed in there as well. Like I said, it's not some amazingly smart and original piece of storytelling, but that doesn't just automatically make it a bad movie by a long shot. Like I stated, I personally really enjoy this movie and have watched it several times and do not understand all the hate it gets.

567,avadams,"Dark, murky and full of missed opportunities.",4,2 April 2020,"This movie is tries (and fails) to be a mix of Gravity and Alien, yet it missed the nuances of either. I don't like to write reviews that bash movies, but sometimes you're just compelled to. Slow and plodding, you're presented with familiar scenarios and bog-standard movie tropes. By the end of the film, you're left wondering what the whole point of the exercise was. You're just left with a sense of meh -- no real highs, lows, or memorable moments.None of the characters are particularly likable, except maybe Vincent Cassel as the Captain, but the rest are basically one-dimensional. Kristen Stewart is back from her role in the disastrous Charlie's Angels remake, and she's still trying to prove that she can act outside of the Twilight series. She's no Ellen Ripley by any stretch. Note to Kristen: Jet Li took acting lessons to prepare for his role in Unleashed and he was awesome for more than his fighting prowess. She's basically our main protagonist with the tortured past who serves as a linchpin for these underwater operations. But by the time her ""arc"" is revealed, I doubt that you'll care. The other members of the crew are kinda bland, although if I'm ever in a life-or-death scenario with someone like T.J. Miller, I hope that I'm the first to go. Every movie HAS to have an irreverent, unfunny jerk in stressful situations, I guess?My biggest complaint is that the movie is just too dark and the water is too murky to really see anything. That attempt at ""realism"", when combined with the CGI and the jump cut editing makes for a confusing visual mess. Ultimately, there's nothing particularly groundbreaking about this movie. Everything it has to offer has been done better in The Abyss, DeepStar Six or Leviathan. You get the same scares, better casts, effects and cinematography with any of them.",Underwater

The action hits you right out the gate and the slow parts aren't too long or bad. Kristen Stewart gave a great performance and T.J. Miller was awesome as usual. Vincent Cassel and the beautiful Jessica Henwick also gave great performances. The lacking comes only from the fact that this movie has been done.

In fact she's actually very good in this film to match a fast pace claustrophobic story influenced by Leviathan/Alien/others. While there are cliche moments throughout there are enough thrills and turns within the plot to keep your interest. The best part is the creature though which is actually very vicious and intimidating with a very intriguing origin. The cgi utilized is very well executed as well which these days can be up in the air in films. Overall it's a welcome addition to the deep sea horror genre.,Underwater

575,Seasuzie,It was not the worst,6,6 February 2020,I watch many horror sci fi movies from blockbusters to low budget found footage. This movie could have been great with special effects. I have mixed feelings about Kristen Stewart. I like her since she was a young actress but she has certain facial expressions that distract me. I don't think she is the type of actress that you can focus the camera close to her face without it feeling weird. You can zoom in certain actresses that can act without speaking. Just their expressions. I think she would do better in a ensemble cast. I definitely think this movie is about a 5 or 6. But I'm very tolerant of sci fi horror movies because there not many out there. I wish Kristen could get some acting lessons to help her not make the same expressions in every movie she is in.,Underwater

Everything about the Underwater they did it quite impressive except for running on the seabed? Let alone putting on high-tech heavy weight wetsuit!! Everyone did a pretty good job in the film. I like the focus in facial expression, otherwise animated CGI could have easily done it all. The creature at some point correlates to the damage done on the rigs. For a second when they flashes the monster i thought Godzilla might jump off the screen. I also thought it might serve a better credit let just say the film includes the rescue operation from the above.. that would overall balance the core ingredient supposedly the mighty company would be interested to save the assets, the people from the bottom of the ocean. Where were they?

The action starts literally two minutes in and doesn't let up. Not a lot of character development, but you learn little bits along the way. The acting was competent. But the real reason we all want to see the movie: the monsters. They didn't disappoint! Very Lovecraft-ian and tentacle-y and had some pretty cool kills. Downsides for me were that the ending was kinda corny and there was a little too much comedy sprinkled in. But hey, it was a fun time! If you like creature features definitely check it out.",Underwater

The movie had good potential which kinda got ruined near the end of the movie. I still liked the ending personally, I just think there was not enough of it, the crucial ending contents needed to be explored more! In the beginning the movie is very engaging, around the middle part it slows down a bit but I actually enjoyed that since it is a movie about venturing into the lonely dark depths of underwater abyss and like I said, I enjoyed the reveal near the end. But I can see people getting bored of the movie in general by that time.
Conclusion: Its not everyone's cup of tea! I would only recommend it to people who are interested in these type of slow, tension building movies with little pay-off and those who are desperately looking for a movie that has underwater experience and is within the horror genre because to be honest there are only a couple other such movies out there that I can think of.",Underwater

In fact I hadn't even seen a trailer. The sci-fi premise of drilling at the bottom of the Marianna trench is a fantastic setting and with the pacing of the film being so brisk it leaves little time to question the film's antagonists. I felt at times that I was watching a video game plot play out in film. This is no bad thing as some of the best stories take place in video games but I'm this case a little more exposition would have been welcome. The effects were fantastic, just really matched the tone, the darkness of the sea mixed with the creature creation on show was really good given the budget....and in fact went beyond the budget. The cast is an absolute credit to the producers and casting agency...A+ all around...apart from TJ miller. I enjoyed his quips and one liners at the beginning but his humour was incredibly misplaced after half an hour of the film. It just didn't work then. Stewart was very good as the lead, I have always liked her in anything that wasn't twilight. For me John Gallagher Jr is a superb actor who I always enjoy seeing and deserves bigger roles so it was great to see him in this. And Vinny Cassel just adds gravitas to anything he is in.

Production: Underwater was shot in 2017 and was released in 2020 which says something. Taking that into consideration, before watching the movie I had some doubts, but after the first act I was surprised and well invested. I enjoyed every minute of it. Script: Brian Duffield and Adam Cozad did a great job; the script was very well written and very well executed. The storyline was thrilling from start to finish. There are some things that bothered me but overall, it was great. Acting: I was extremely impressed by Kristen Stewart's performance; it is one of her better performances, as well as Vincent who also did a great job. Cinema and sound: Yes! The cinematography excelled in their work and maintained it throughout the movie. I was a bit disappointed with the score, Marco Beltrami is an excellent composer, but I didn't feel he put in as much effort into this as he should have. Additionally, the Music department work and sound effects were fairly good. Conclusion: Usually, movies that include this type of storyline, isolation and survival plot draw my attention, and I tend to have a more optimistic mindset before watching them. This movie did not disappoint, it is not a masterpiece, but I really enjoyed watching it. Rating: 8/10.",Underwater

TJ Miller's character wasn't so great, his jokes were off beat and it didn't suit the atmosphere of the filmThings that can improve the movie: (WARNING! Spoiler begins)I wish they had added another 10 minutes to the movie, to explore the connection between the characters and Cthulhu better; for example, how (and why) the characters were acting weird and influenced by unseen forces outside of the rig disaster. And why did the captain have a picture of Cthulhu and the strange map in his locker, so on and so forth.A few more minutes to the ending to depict how, despite being the survivors, Emily and Smith were haunted by their encounter with Cthulhu in the deep sea, and so their mental fortitude never recover completely for the rest of their lives, knowing that Cthulhu might still be alive and sleeping in the deep corner of the earth, before reawakening one day, in the future.",Underwater

You will rarely see that in your typical movie.2. When she tells the other girl to get in the pod, she doesn't stop to have a heart a heart convo about life. She tries for second then punches her in the face.Yes characters development was not present, yes we know absolutely nothing about the creatures. But it was different and engaging right from the beginning as there was no time to stop to explain or learn, because everyone is simply focused on the goal of escaping to the surface because of limited oxygen. A typical movie like this takes 30 minutes to get to the point or start to really let you know what the movie is about. This one smacks you in the face with it and engages you right from the beginning.If you like movies like ""the decent"" or ""cloverfield paradox"" then watch this, its just as fun.If you like games like ""Dead Space"" or ""Resident Evil""(not the movies).

Kristen Stewart is a divisive person who is horribly miscast as a cringy character with a trendy, androgynous look that will not win over detractors. An older, more established actress would've been a better fit - think Famke Janssen, Juliette Lewis, Shawnee Smith.Vincent Cassel is a sympathetic work-horse who really should not be the most mature on a crew like this. TJ Miller plays...TJ Miller again, love him or not. The rest are mediocre.The story, tech & creature effects are thankfully solid. Claustrophobic, tense & heavy on action right from the beginning. If you are a fan of classic underwater sci-fi like Abyss, Leviathan, etc - this will prove a worthy addition.",Underwater

610,markdv-19,Average horror with some poor choices,5,20 February 2020,"This movie has a lot of good and bad mixed in with it. Sadly I feel like the bad pulls the movie down far too much.In regards to the positives, I really enjoyed the setting. I have always liked movies with creatures lurking in the dark, ready to claim their next victim at any moment. The movie did this well and used the extremely dark ocean floor in interesting ways that I felt really made the movie interesting. I also loved the diving suits that were utilized in the film. They had a great design that was very satisfying to me.There were two areas where this movie faulted for me. The first was in its character development and interactions. There was always something that seemed to be propelling the plot forward in a manner that felt rushed. Because of this it was hard to get any development that makes you feel for the characters in any significant ways. I felt this was a big drawback especially since it seems like the characters had potential to be very interesting. The second area this movie failed was in its last act. The movie has a drastic development that took me out of the movie. I really did not enjoy it and I felt it detracted from the movie greatly. I can see some people liking this development but I feel like the majority will not.Overall this is an average movie that could be a fun one time watch if you cannot seem to find anything else. This movie could have been much better but I feel like it ruined promising potential with poor choices.",Underwater

The tone and mood for the film was established right at the beginning, and was consistent. The action and danger for the characters started right away wasting no time, which I liked. There were quite a few cliches, and predictable things that happened, which took me out of the film a bit, but didn't completely wash away my enjoyment of the film.The plot-twists that I guess were supposed to make me go WHAAT??? or WOAH didn't really make me do that, so the climax was a bit anti-climatic. I did like the characters, and enjoy their interactions though. I liked the ending too, although some people I know disagree.

The action just pours down upon them out of the blue without any hint of a cause or any of them being at least somewhat connected to what's happening or to each other, diminishing their motives & actions to those of laboratory rats being experimented on. The narrative touches a subject of a person being active about one's life and not giving up, which is a very good message, layed out and supported by the lead performance, however, unnecessarily ruined by the devastating ending, devoiding the movie of it's wholesomeness. Overall a senseless & forgettable endeavour.Oh, and the way they are running(!) at such depth makes me think none of them had ever tried to even walk underwater at, say, 3-meter depth, let alone running like that under the 8-mile-thick layer of water. It's simply impossible. Utter nonsense.",Underwater
616,Agent_Smoulder,A spiritual successor to Deep Star Six not to Lovecraft.,8,22 January 2020,"First off, I can see why someone would say that this is like LIFE, but I feel that is kind of selling this film short.
Second, I'm not sure if people know this but it's really really dark underwater, if you've been in a cave system before than they turn off the lights you CAN NOT SEE, now imagine you are also surrounded by water that is constantly filled with silt from the ground, poop, pee, and tiny little bits of dead things all constantly floating around you all the time. It's supposed to be hard to see, that's why this isn't Leviathan (another movie I love) with OBVIOUS sets where balloons holding boxes dangle from OBVIOUS strings which is great entertainment but hasn't aged very well with HD resolutions.This movie is a lot like Gravity in tone(?) and maybe pacing, I get that sense that it's possible for the main characters to survive IF they keep calm and professional and get themselves where they need to be. We still have the distinct actors that we know from other things but unlike in Gravity where most people seemed to find it super distracting with Bullock all by herself they don't have JUST Kristen Stewart carrying the entire second half of the movie by herself, and when she is carrying it she does a great job. B-BUT SHE WAS IN TWILIGHT! you say, so were a lot of people who are normally great actors, NO ONE DOES A GOOD ACTING JOB IN TWILIGHT, so just move on and forget about it, it can't hurt you anymore.SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT JUST IN CASE~!People are apparently complaining about a heavy handed environmental message in this film, wut? Like they had 2 characters say stuff like ""We shouldn't be down here"" ""What we're doing isn't right"" or something along those lines, literally 2 lines immediately followed up with a ""We dug too deep"" line that pretty much sealed the deal for me on why I enjoyed this film, it was a what if not a It could happen! Mines Of Moria scenario not CHUD, so if you were worried about that don't be, it's just people freaking out and exposing their fears is all. Same with the whole ""This feels like a you go girl film"", like wut!? OMG don't watch a movie like Aliens or Fury Road, I'm sorry if a woman being competent at her job (you know the thing the company she works for put her down there to do) if a feminist propaganda thing to you.My biggest complaint is that almost all the monster stuff was CGI, like 90% + think. I would have enjoyed a few of the main creatures to have some like practical limbs or a creepy head puppet or something in one or two scenes but it wasn't a deal breaker or anything. Second biggest complaint is that 2 characters are in a relationship but you don't really get any sense of bonding out of them for most of the movie and that's just cause of the scenario and less of the fact of poor writing, just idk, people act weird in life or death situations.They spent a lot of money on a gimmick horror thriller and I really really appreciate that. These kinds of movies don't happen much anymore it feels like and with the way this is going over I don't think the box office returns are gonna change this trend.IF they had about half the budget and instead used dinky older style suits and did the sets like Leviathan perhaps this would be more well received with a more reachable profit margin but they shelved the film for almost 3 years (I assume when LIFE didn't do that great financially) so who knows what is going on with it.IF this is really the last FOX movie, a shame but at least they went out on a high note.I'm sure I could discuss this thing for another hour or so and go into various things but I really don't wanna type for hours.",Underwater

This is the kind of movie that gets criticized for lack of character development and thin plotting, even though the lack of both is exactly the point. The script gets out of its own way and lets the characters just react. Kristen Stewart and co. are excellent and you root for them. Bonus points for the ending, which is surprisingly moving.

623,stephenmonachello,Swing and miss,5,2 December 2020,"Underwater is one of those films that pops its head up every year that leaves you scratching your head. This film could have been better with a few re-writes and treatments. The film has too many gaps. The film felt rushed and when I say rushed I mean quickly done. I felt someone came up with the idea of crossing Alien with The Abyss and just winged the film.
There are a few things I liked. I like how the film quickly starts. No drag, no long period of waiting for something to happen. Just in your face action from the start. I also liked the idea. I like the idea of something mysterious. Was it an Earthquake? Was it a shark? Or was it something else. I am also happy they didn't use sharks. Like zombies, sharks have been played to death in films of late.
Here is what I didn't like. Kristen Stewart. I am perplexed how she keeps getting roles. She is not a good actor. She has the same look, some poor delivery, same unemotional response to any situation. The lack of showing what chasing the oil crew. The film is so dark in spots, it ruins the whole appeal of Sci Fi. Story Arch and character development. As I stated before, the scripted seemed rushed and you can tell with story arc and character development. The arcs of the characters are random and thrown at you at different points of the film. The film seems rushed. The characters do things too quickly to be realistic. Finally, action sequences. These Matrix like special effects have been played to death. Every action sequence does not need to be slowed down and put in slow motion.

But not so long ago we've had Hollywood drilling right through the core of the Earth, and even venturing into a black hole. Ridiculous, right? But this is not a documentary. It's. Science. Fiction.Not a fail because of acting, either. Vincent Cassel is solid, as always. TJ Miller plays the annoying buffoon, as per usual, and adds a bit of fun. A super-fit Kristen Stewart is the standout and you'll see a range of emotions flash over her face including horror, anger, determination, resignation, triumph, despair - if only the anti-Stewart trolls cared to look! The hard working cast and their stuntpersons take a battering in the action-filled plot right from the start.Underwater fails because it generates no suspense. The screenplay and the direction leave it floundering. 91 minutes seems a lot more.Much of the movie is visually dark but where that worked so well in creating drama for a film like Alien, with Underwater it flops.

The moral of story might or might not sent a good message. I'll leave it up to you. The performance was good, but like I said the plot could have been better.

It's a shame. I couldn't get past this, so didn't pay much attention to the movie. Also she was completely incomprehensible. Couldn't understand a word she said.

No good soundtrack, no good direction, plot holes, dumb characters with 0 backstory or relevance, no good acting, no good set or lighting, not even good color grading.

That said, I generally find that having low expectations at the outset tend to make an average movie feel better than it perhaps was.
What I did like is that it avoided the common movie trope whereby the first half hour of the movie is spent giving us some background of the characters, what I would call ""the touchy feely"" section, before finally getting going with the story.
This movie dispenses with this ballast, and gets straight into the action, moving along at a good pace.
Others are correct in citing such movies as The Abyss, Leviathan, Deep Star Six and Alien.

649,k-60298,Underwhelming,5,18 May 2020,"Underwater is a 2020 American science fiction horror film directed by William Eubank and staring Kristen Stewart, Vincent Cassel, Jessica Henwick and John Gallagher Jr. Underwater was made on a $50-80 million budget but only grossed $40.9 million therefore squandering any hopes of a sequel.Underwater isn't exactly a unique story, Alien but underwater, that's basically the thought process of the movie but that doesn't mean you can't have fun with it. The cast is likeable, Kirsten Stewart, Vincent Cessel and Mamoudou Athie both open the film with a cliche yet enjoyable start however the character motivations in the second half of the film are believable but questionable by how they go about it therefore dampening the believe ability slightly.The classic trait of an unseen monster lurking around a confined space is an overused trait in Hollywood but that doesn't mean this isn't one of the better films to use it, the few glimpses of the monster work well to build tension , however, Underwater is hampered with many of the genres typical cliches making certain points predictable and therefore causing many moments to feel unsatisfactory and a few deaths meaningless.Underwater has many flaws, the character development is horrendous and the lack of explanation for what's going on can easily confuse the audience but if you like dumb monster movies then you can do far worse then this movie and I must say that I enjoyed the little snippets of news articles at the beginning and the end, that was a nice addition.The claustrophobic nature of this film works superb with its underwater setting and is one of the better features of this film as you personally feel confined as well. The cast do well enough with the basic script they are given and the few glimpses of the monster work well to build up tension but for a horror movie it doesn't induce genuine scares and feels more like it should be just be classed as just an action/thriller.Underwater won't revolutionise the genre in the same way Alien did but does have a few enjoyable scenes, however, it feels more suited to being the fourth Cloverfield movie then being a stand alone film. If they would have linked it to the Cloverfield universe then this movie would have worked better, however as a stand alone flick it fails to impress in certain parts and leaves you unsatisfied throughout with a mix of enjoyable and unsatisfying moments makes Underwater an very average film.",Underwater

Even when she's not talking or acting (Kristen rarely acts. her face defaults to a sour and pained look as if she suffers from perpetual constipation). Someone says something, cut to Kristen.

658,declyons,"Solid, Suspenseful Horror Movie.",8,12 February 2020,"A crew if highly-skilled deep-sea drilling workers must risk a dangerous ocean bed evacuation to reach a structurally stable section of their rig in order to reach safety. Dangers abound, both known and unknown out in the dark abyss.The dynamic of the surviving group is constantly believable and their growth and adaptation to their new, life-threatening circumstances is seamless. At no point did the actors' portrayals feel contrived or rushed.Vincent Cassel is not at his best but the role of a cool-headed, stalwart captain fits easily into his wheelhouse and his performance is enjoyable. TJ Miller is once again TJ Miller; his oddball persona lends well to the character of Paul whose banter and bonhomie offers most of what little comic relief there is. Jessica Henwick's Emily is perhaps the most out-of-depth character, who struggles initially with the burden faced by the group, often on the verge of panic but wills herself through the very worst thrown at her. Henwick's performance is thoroughly solid and enjoyable. Definitely the best I've seen from her.The star of this movie is definitely Kristen Stewart and her performance justifies her prominence. I feel I should add I almost didn't go to see this film as I haven't enjoyed the movies she usually makes, but this performance has instilled me with good faith going forward. As a mechanical engineer, her character, Norah, is one whose expertise and resourcefulness are key to the teams chances of escape. Initially struggling with the pressure of the predicament and weight of responsibility, we watch her progress with aplomb.The sense of foreboding hardly ever relents and the sense of impending doom is sometimes stifling. This film will compare surprisingly well next to classic sci-fi horrors such as The Thing and Alien.",Underwater

They do an excellent job setting the scene and laying out what needs to be done all within the first 10/15 minutes.For the most part all the characters were convincing at portraying panicky/worried workers trying to survive. TJ did a decent job with comedic relief while Kristen Stewart was suprisingly able to convey enough emotion to sell her more dramatic scenes. I'm ecstatic they didn't make her character the Mary Sue of the sea, especially because she had the feminism haircut so that's worth some bonus points.As for the storyline, it's a bit cliche with the whole ""unfamiliar environment & something's hunting the characters"" but it did a decent job trying to keep it entertaining with great set design and sick diving suits that looked like something out of the Lost Planet games. The monsters looked a bit boring except for that final reveal at the end. A giant crab would've been more threatening than those things but they weren't given too much screentime so whatever.If they fixed the garbage creature design, those few very dark and shaky cam scenes and lose a some of the corny jumpscares you'd have an excellent horror movie!",Underwater

What you could see was wisp, something floating in the dark corners, and monster things in holes. I think.The storyline was full of information that lacked details and the characters weren't relatable.

Kristen Stewart really shines in the title role, and the creature stuff is awesome with strong Lovecraftian influence. This however is where you crave more imagination as the film only grazes the surface of what's possible. At the same time, it can be seen as a strength, inspiring the imagination to greater depths. If you haven't seen Stuart Gordon's Dagon, I highly recommend it. A little more meat on the bone for those who want to go a little deeper.Unfortunately the film's less than stellar performance at the box office could be attributed to the fact that the 80s are gone, and the masses are more interested in Dr. Pimple Popper online, or whichever million different rabbit holes of content we're overwhelmed with these days. I would also say the film's marketing made an error in burying the fact that it was a monster flick.

It was a mixed bag for me, one that I enjoyed more than expected but failed in a couple of spots.I largely can't disagree with suggestions that there was no character development with one exception, Jessica Henwick's Emily character. For the first half of the movie I wished this cliche'd damsel in hysterical distress would just die and be put out of my misery. But by the end of the movie she was found to be tenacious and resilient.It's true that many people find Stewart's acting wooden, but when I see it mentioned I often wonder if these people also find Bronson, Eastwood, Brenner, and Wayne wooden. All of these people made careers on resting-b***h-face and I don't see why it's unacceptable for a woman. That said, Stewart's character didn't really have far to grow in this one. She started out as a stoic, intelligent, self-sacrificing bad-a** and pretty much maintained that throughout. I do want to give her a nod for that final scene. Her expression in that scene seemed to me to encompass the entirety of what character growth happened for the character in the entire movie, and Stewart delivered it with subtle grace.I would have liked to have seen the monsters a little more clearly and because I couldn't I find myself wanting to agree that the cinematography was lazy. I don't really know enough about movie production to make that call, but the extreme lack of clarity in the water scenes throughout the movie was more frustrating than suspenseful.Props to the nod to Lovecraft in the final quarter to one-third of the movie.

I hoped it so much much that the incident seemed like a dream sequence. It wasn't, it just kept going.The movie isn't great, some of the action is shot and edited poorly making it confusing at times. The plot is predictable and trite. The emotional scenes are sappy and eye rolling. Despite all these things I didn't hate it. It didn't make me miserable. The atmosphere and visuals are very good. The scares are almost exclusively cheap jump scares.Certain aspects of the ending ALMOST made it all worth it. I wished they kept going with IT, but no they bungled that too.In conclusion.

The film doesn't take any time to set up the characters and environment, it just throws you in and off you go. This can be a good thing if done right, but the filmmakers show us impressively, how it's done wrong. All the right ingredients did not blend at all.
Stewart does what she can with the given script, and again shows that she is an interesting and good-looking woman, but not a particularly good actor. The rest of the crew is pretty forgettable with a standard assortment of wannabe-badasses acting extra stupid. Yes. They basically make the crew of Alien Covenant look like geniuses.
The cinematography is all over the place. Some shots are really good, but then others are just dark and damp, where you can't tell whatsoever what you're looking at. The sound design hits every horror cliche and the music is a hodgepodge of a hundred scores you've heard before.If you're an avid Kristin Stewart fan, you might get some enjoyment out of it, but if you want to see a good horror scifi movie, you'd best stay away from it.",Underwater

The characters are okay. They're pretty good considering there's not really a break in the action at any point. This is the opposite of a slow film. The pacing is lightning quick.Some of the character motivations and the realism of certain scenes did stir some skepticism in me. These suits they wear must be incredibly tough; far tougher than even the best space age technology because characters are dragged at high velocity over the ocean floor and yet there's never a rip or a break in these characters suits. That seemed to me to be a little oversight.Despite everything else, this film does one thing very well. Something incredibly important for horror films. This movie has a very strong sense of atmosphere. The set design is stellar. The CG and effects are exceptional.

711,smithdana-26441,Modern and solid retelling of Leviathan and Deepstar Six,6,31 March 2021,"The action starts just minutes into the film, and from there it's one long action sequence till the very end. There is no time for character building, but here it is OK, because all characters are likeable. Kristen Stewart's acting is subdued as usual, but the viewer can see that she is used to carrying a film by herself - and this is what she is doing here successfully. The story is straight out of the underwater monster movies from the end 80s and would have worked just as well as a thriller without interference from the outside. Unfortunately the twist at the end is an unnecessary overkill that drags the story to the edge of (even more) ridicule. The underwater shots, especially their duration, are quite impressive. All in all a solid but not outstanding little horror film.",Underwater
712,Hatlikeasharkfin,Underwater is a bingo card of subgenre cliche,4,26 April 2020,"This one has really got it all (except story or characters)! You get to follow the adventures of Not Ellen Ripley as she battles an onslaught of creatures from the deep, thirsty for blood or something. Look, they didn't bother with story so there's no use spending much time on it. Nobody would watch it for the plot.It's not bad, per se, so much as it's just really forgettable. You couldn't care less about these characters, so the peril never hits home. Nothing is really at stake.
It's more of an effects reel than an actual movie.It's not the kind of failure that involves trying and faltering, it's the kind that involves no effort at all - staying at home with folded arms and refusing to participate.Since you're watching to see what the monsters look like: they're fine. The whole movie is fine. It looks good but has little to offer, so Kristin Stewart is perfect for the role!",Underwater

Character development was left on the side of the road but if you remember the film Alien you don't get to know half the crews name before the bodies start hitting the floor. Although this movie has many similarities to Ridley Scott Alien it wouldn't be fair to compare the two as Alien is a sifi horror classic. I love the look of the films tech. I loved how claustrophobic they made me feel. Compared to some of the garbage they're releasing today Underwater is a refreshing change. If you give it a chance It won't disappoint.,Underwater

724,bosullivan2-719-143250,Alien Diluted,4,21 December 2020,"Good cast. Some good set-pieces. Opening scene exhilarating. But overall just a let down. Which is disappointing because everyone was trying hard to make a really good sci-fi flick.Primarily due to poor backstories. Poor location set-up/geography. Poor lighting. Poor dialogue.I can only imagine how difficult it is to create an underwater movie. The logistics must be a nightmare. But if you're going to do it, while they achieved what it must feel like to be underwater and attacked in scuba gear, you have to consider your audience, it's a movie, we're here to be entertained, but if we can't see what's going on, it's hard to enjoy.A good horror movie device in these set-ups is to show the audience the monster that the characters can't see. Just because the victims can't see anything, sometimes the tension can be built by us the viewer knowing what is about to happen.Tension however is not built by shining a torch down a dark corridor. Which is what this movie resorts to, on too many occasions.As for the set-up, this movie is a perfect example for film students as to why establishing characters and the Geography of a location is so important, even if it feels boring and delays the anticipated monster battle. We need that intro to invest in the characters & care about them when they start getting knocked off 1-by-1. And we need to understand where they are running to and from. So we can have a reference in our head of the location, before it was destroyed, and to then revel/ aguish in its destruction.Otherwise you're left with a movie that just feels diluted, there should be something more. But you can never quite put your finger on it. Until it's all over.",Underwater

I won't spoil it anymore apart from to say the only saving grace is Kristen's tight physique. She must have worked out a bit for this one.

When you can actually see the source of the destruction and chaos, well I thought it was really crazy. Don't want to give things away. Edge of your seat entertainment.

There's no view of the underwater structure that gives you an idea of it's shape or size. Why are they even there? They appear to be drilling, but neglect to tell you for what. Many gaps in the story. Acting isn't bad. Stewart never smiles which isn't any different than most of the characters she portrays. Wish I hadn't wasted the $5.99 to rent this movie.

So with that being said, any time there's a movie about deep water adventures and discovery, I'm all in!! Add a little bit of fear and scary creatures for a thrill and I'm also a fan!!Now almost immediately this movie gave me Aliens vibes and it kept on giving throughout. Like I could probably name off every moment something reminded me of Aliens but that would give away too many spoilers. Although it had so many Aliens like qualities, it didn't make me dislike the movie, I actually liked that it did.There's some action where the place blows up a bit and puts them in a tough place in terms of survival, a lot of jump scares, some death scenes, scary creature scenes, and I enjoyed all of it. I even felt a little claustrophobic myself.But something felt ""off"" about the movie. Like we didn't get any character development. We didn't even really know these characters enough and had nothing to cheer for if they lived or be upset about if they died, I guess. I wish they gave more explanation of the creatures or maybe even if the characters discussed the creatures more??

781,lunty-28700,Not a terrible action film if you disconnect your brain for a while.,7,14 June 2021,"The characters are bland stereotypical trope so the movie does away with any semblance of character building and just jumps into the action after about a minute of Kristen Stewart needlessly in a sports bra scene.Queue a basically non-stop action scene of characters panicking, doing random stupid stuff (for example just poking away bare handed at a completely unknown organism with no idea if it might be toxic or not, or even still alive for that matter) and trying their best to get themselves killed while trying to survive but instead inevitably getting picked off one by one with the obligatory self sacrificing hero scene. All pretty standard action film stuff and not that badly done really.Movie winds up pretty much the same way it starts with our star once again needlessly wandering around in her underwear while deciding to detonate the entire drilling rig to take out the super monster and its nasty little minions. A process which is as distressingly simple as opening one menu, setting the reactor containment systems to off and waiting 60 seconds for the meltdown! Not even so much as an MS windows type warning prompt along the lines of ""are you sure you want to detonate a multi billion dollar drilling rig and kill yourself and anyone else still inside?""Other than that random bit of insanity, overall a decent way to waste an hour and a half.

I know all the movies that compare or can be compared to this I can see why. I even see video game comparisons . But here's where I don't take away from the film. I watched it with watching a trailer or comparing it to another movie . I just got the movie and turned it on. And thought it was an earthquake the whole entire time. What made it more interesting and had me glued was I didn't think it was an earthquake while watching . The whole time I'm wondering what it is. Kristen Stewart wasn't bad at all. She was a straight forward character due to wanting to save everyone . Heroic character such a super hero's don't show much sympathy or much character but do what they have to do to get her people to safety . She couldn't show emotions or feelings . Why should she ? She was straight forward as needed to be . If anyone was paying attention blame the Captain who was shaken up and didn't have one clue what was going on and took every ""what was that moment"" like it was a trip to Walmart . His favorite thing to say was maybe it was this or maybe it was that . And it was clearly not that. So we needed someone to take every moment serious such as Kristen Stewart . Cause no one else was . Awesome movie . Had me glued . No character development yes but each character has their own way of dealing with such traumatic events . Which has you feeling like you know each character . Without a back story being present . 2 stars down cause there isn't wrong with character development being added but would have dragged the movie out therefore missing the point of the main plot which was to get straight to it and know just enough to feel every death felt you was there . And every reaction was ""oh gosh"" before and after every death. Don't listen to those who are rating it 5 and below. I recommend you to tell your friends to watch it. And tell them to ignore trailers or reviews under 6/10 . Before you watch a movie . Any more just cut it on and watch it . Check the ratings . But don't read them. Just watch it . And maybe movies like this will get more credit . Mic dropped 🎤",Underwater
791,zhamilton05,Very solid,7,21 April 2020,"It's great when a movie pulls off something original and scary, but those are rare! If Underwater is derivative, at least it's riffing off of Alien and The Descent, two of the greatest creature horror films of all time!
I thought Underwater was tense and atmospheric and well-directed. Some of the acting was very good (Stewart was all-in), and I thought TJ Miller offered a nice light tone as the comedic relief. The creatures were...okay. The ending felt somewhat contrived, though still interesting. Maybe the best part was that you never felt like the team was safe. That constant dread didn't just come from the creatures, but from being 7 miles under the ocean surface, which makes sense!

But, everything else is just bad, first of all you can barely see anything through the whole movie, the cast was looking promising but because everything is so rushed there is no character development and you dont really care about anyone also, maybe is just me but Vincent Cassel just doesnt look good as a good guy and his casting here was a bit misplaced. There is no reason to blame Kristen Stewart for the acting here as the movie just sucks and no matter who the actor was instead of her it would still suck.

The movie used some of the typical tricks to create tension, but not in a way that it was overly relied upon. Between the risks of underwater structures failing and the unknown creatures, there were plenty of thrills throughout.I think it could have benefitted from a longer finale that had the protagonist do more than just press some buttons to take out the creatures. The murkiness of the water in the ocean floor scenes worked but was a little much at times, even if accurate for such a situation, as seeing the creatures more clearly as they approached or in the background would have been appreciated and could have added to the tension at times. After all, it is a monster movie but I don't feel like I got many clear looks at any of them.Nevertheless, it was a tense 90 minutes that didn't waste time getting into the action and didn't let up until the end. I also appreciated that the origin of the creatures isn't over explained, as I'd rather fill in the blanks than be provided with an inevitably flawed explanation. Other than noted above, all the elements of the movie and performances were solid. As a fan of the Sci-fi/Horror genre, I was left satisfied and wanting more.Although it seems unlikely, a sequel was set up at the end and a movie that builds upon what this one did right could be awesome.7.5/10",Underwater

The low point is everything else ..
Especially the failure to give us a real and discernible environment in which to have the action play out.Had we had more time inside the Kepler Station, we would have had more connection to why they were so far underwater. Couple that with introducing us to the dead bodies littered along the way.. and u might have had a good movie!
Part of our love of the Alien film series, is that each one has its own cast and its own envirantfir is to identify with after the movie is overWithout that.. we are left with a murky, mess that ends up boring us and having us come up for air long before the film intends us to do so !",Underwater
807,gabogrance,Excellent idea with a horrible development,4,13 February 2020,"We all agree that the depths of the ocean are an uncertain and even terrifying world. At Underwater, led by William Eubank, we get into the skin of a group of scientists in the Mariana Trench who are threatened after an earthquake catastrophically damaged a station and, as they try to take refuge, they realize that they are not alone.The premise is interesting; quite, I would add. It has the potential to play with our fears, but unfortunately never does it at all. Yes, there are scenes where the suspense leaves you at the edge of the seat, but, I repeat, the climax is never reached.There are no admirable performances. The two most experienced artists, Kristen Stewart and Vincent Cassel, fail to stand out and so there is not a plus to the film. Much has to do, of course, the tight and horrible script. If I had to give a consolation star, it would be to T. J. Miller, who plays the typical funny of the group, but at least he does his job well.So what's good about the movie? I would say that it has two strengths that try to save the situation: production design and photography.With respect to the first one, in certain scenes it is possible to capture a feeling of overwhelm and confinement through the realistic narrow places (to achieve this sensation the photograph is excellent, too). On the contrary, when the shot is made in the vast ocean or in the endless seabed, it also feels real. With respect to the second one, apart from capturing the moments of claustrophobia, it is simply great how it is achieved with first-person views to see absolutely nothing in the dark ocean floor. Nothing, just lights and the occasional shadow of the monster from which we want to escape. Without a doubt, a strong point of the film.Thus, a film that looks so good in the roles, is actually 'meh'. Having only airs (and monsters) from movies like Alien and Cloverfield is not enough.",Underwater
808,amboseman,Close but no Cigar,7,22 January 2020,Underwater is visually appealing with really nice set & sound design and competent cinematography. Stewart & Cassel are both really good but both seem handcuffed my a poorly written script with an uneven tone. T.J. Miller is a very funny guy and I generally like him but this film could have really done without the comic relief. The other 2 members of the survival group are very forgettable. I would have liked to have seen a more straightforward adventure with Stewart & Cassel.The creatures were ok but I think they could have gone with more of a slow burn or psychological terror approach. It is implied in the credits exposition that living in deep pressure causes unpredictable side effects. There is a scene quite deep in the film that played with this a little bit but it never came to fruition.Overall this film reminds me of The Abyss mixed with Godzilla: King of Monsters and doesn't quite hit the mark for me because it is more of the latter than the former. Final note: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE someone cast Kristen Stewart as Amanda Ripley in a screen adaptation of Alien: Isolation.,Underwater

My girlfriend doesn't usually partake of this type of entertainment by default, but was at the edge of her seat (or our couch) for the duration of the movie, biting her nails.It's a very entertaining movie first and foremost, so it ticks that box.After the first 2-3 minutes of the movie we get pushed directly into action which is an hour and a half long fight for survival with only a few moments of respite where our characters are allowed to relax and breathe. I think the film is paced very well.There is a lack of character development and that of a more solid background story/exploration of the mythology behind the mysterious creatures causing mayhem on the deep sea drilling platform. The movie does attempt to cover that through initial opening credit to some extent but it's obvious it's almost an afterthought.In all fairness, it does leave a bit too much unanswered, for example the moment when they catch the smaller creature nothing really meaningful develops of it, rather than some ""I've never seen anything like it"" platitudes.But at the same time, the characters feel distinct, genuine and real for the most part, and there is an unexpected twist at the very end of the film and some spectacular moody CGI. About 10 minutes after I was vehemently explaining to my girlfriend that only Kirsten will survive by the end (and after I remarked the other female character will be the first to die), the writers decided on pretty good plot twist.",Underwater

There are quick edits of the ""monster"" whenever attacking the crew which makes it incredibly frustrating not being able to get a feel what they're up against. Most of the movie is of the crew running away from the sea monster things, and when the first one dies all you see is their helmet fill up with dark blood and get quickly pulled away. Same thing for each of the crew members deaths, just really fast crap editing to see as little as possible of anything. Kristin Stewart was ok in her ""Ripley"" type role, can't say the same for the rest of the cast, with the other female being way too annoying to care if she lived or died, and the other guy with the stupid connection to a stuffed animal.

Underwater clearly demonstrates Eubanks skill as a director blending everything we love from classic sci-fi and Thrillers to create something that kept my muscles tensed and eyes wide open.When looking at the plot 'Underwater' offers nothing new if you've seen Alien, The Abyss, The Sphere, Life or Gravity but the aesthetics and tension are all there.With a fairly short run time for movies these days Underwater uses it's time efficiently. The first hour will leave you claustrophobic with a fear of drowning or decompressing wasting no time getting into the films plot.I left Underwater satisfied and would say it's worth a watch in the currently oversaturated market of Film and Tv. Performances are on point and characters act as one would expect.Good movie.",Underwater

I have never been a fan of Stewarts acting ability.. all her movies feature the same mannerisms and voice inflections she always looks like she is still in a twilight movie.

This is in keeping with the relatively short run time. However, I don't think too much is sacrificed in this decision. The writing is very tight, and we get to learn a lot about the characters along the way. Every scene is advancing the plot or characters, and in most cases, both; there's very little walking around or setups for pointless jokes. There are many little things you can pay attention to for extra stuff to pick up on. Like the little bit with the spider in the sink, that scene conveys multiple meanings and layers, the more you think about it. Same with the bunny.The atmosphere is very moody and conducive to lovecraftian/existential horror. Creatures are used VERY sparingly at the beginning, in fact you will have very little clue about what is causing all the chaos. All you know is the character's life is in danger. The situation is very clear at all times, I was never confused about what was happening or why things were happening.For the acting, TJ is by far the weakest link, and most of his scenes are a bit groan inducing. Vincent and, surprisingly, Kristen, put in excellent and understated performances, and their characters are my favorite by a long shot.It's a quick watch, goes by fast, and is nicely creepy and scary, definitely recommended for lights out viewing.",Underwater

Although it is a genre that is used often I found this movie with more content. Also to found out the movie is a lovecraft adaption and with a lot of feel of Alien, I loved the movie even more.
It had no typical characters like a selfish or really dumb guy (that still somehow made it). It were just real people that honestly cared for each other. Don't really get the hate it got.",Underwater

The set design was also amazing, making the obvious comparison to Alien, but kinda all good sci-fi's have this level of detail. Whatever about character building, there is exactly enough to make you care, but also not enough to make you miss when they are gone.I think someone said it was too dark...

855,lefteri-38218,Had low expectations and was still disappointed,1,12 January 2020,"Where do I begin, absolutely no context with the beginning, just gets straight into it. Kinda like I will with this review, not only did this movie lack a plot but it also lacked any kind of substance with the script. You created a movie with Kristen Stewart as the lead role and gave her little to no depth as a character. There's not much worse then Kristen Stewart's acting but at least the director should have known that she's a type cast and she's only good for certain roles. This was not one of them. You needed someone to carry this movie considering there was only 5 actors and they all had low energy except for the one funny guy. When I say this movie was unbearable to watch I'm not saying it lightly. I mean e for effort on trying to be original but the difference between extraordinary and ordinary is that little extra and the extra effort to make this good was nowhere to be found",Underwater
856,geet_phadnis,Under-watered,5,28 January 2020,"SPOILER ALERT!The Geets (Greats):The first third of the movie had excellent use of tension build-up and Stewart did a good job with her performance as Norah. The movie did a good job maintaining the sense of isolation and dread.The movie did a good job in terms of continually progressing the plot. There was the sense that the protagonists had no choice but to 'edge on' and this helped with engaging the audience for the majority of the movie.The scene involving the sudden death of Rodrigo was excellently done with raw, authentic reactions from the protagonists. It highlights the importance of underwater equipment reliability as well as building up the sense of helplessness.
The Phads (Bads):Vincent Cassel didn't give a satisfactory performance as the Captain despite his successful Resume. His lines seemed 'not-so' convincing to say the least. For a movie which heavily relies on the sense of isolation from the rest of humanity, the authenticity of actors involved is important to maintain this and most of these actors, apart from Stewart, failed to deliver an 'above par' performance.The final act failed to live up to my expectations. Despite Stewart's good performance overall her final scene didn't create the effect necessary as her character didn't show vulnerability effectively throughout the movie.There were several cliched moments in the film such as characters miraculously surviving attacks by the underwater creatures or environmental damages. It's a cheap way to continue the plot. Perhaps the movie could have focussed more on the palpable dread and isolation of being stuck in the underwater facility. For me the atmosphere of isolation was more convincing than the underwater creatures.The movie seemed too fast-paced and formulaic of a typical 'creature-feature' movie in order to be enthralled by the tension of inescapability. It failed to deliver on a level of atmosphere and pacing evident in successful movies such as 'Alien' and 'The Thing'. As such, it 'drown' in the sea of most formulaic Horror movies with a few good moments to just about reach the surface.Rating: 4.5/10",Underwater
857,ultratang,"Entertaining, I would say yes",8,31 May 2020,"This is my first review but I thought this film was worth putting in my two cents. I enjoyed it , it has some intense moments, and the pace moves along swiftly. It DEFINITELY has a Cloverfield vibe to it. ( TJ Miller was in the first Cloverfield flick and John Gallagher JR was in 10 Cloverfield Lane...hmmm) I almost expected to JJ Abram's name pop up on the credits. Not the best movie ever, but you could do way worse.
What I liked:
Fast pacing
Good intense scoring
The claustrophobic feeling
Not so much:
Character development
At some points, it gets easy to become distracted(even when they are giving major plot points, and whatever ""backstory""- which isn't a ton, I found that I had to go back a few scenes a couple times.)",Underwater

I'm not a fan of her, but this AntiKS thing I see in all the reviews about the movies she has a part really started to be sickening. Please go away an find a job to do because your rushy responses about how she can't act, how she can ever find a part in a movie, etc. are just pathetic.Beside that, movie is ok, ish. Plot could've been more interesting.
And about the lack of character development, well actually there is, as much as you can deliver within a few hours when you suddenly find yourself in an unexpected fatal crisis situation and realizing that you have almost zero chance of survival.",Underwater

Likeable characters and even when I thought Kristen Stewart was only outperformed in the skill of one-face acting by Frodo and Darth Vader, she is surprisingly good in this one! No idea why this movie is so badly rated. I thought it was well executed and very ""Aliens-esque"" enjoyable.",Underwater

Kristen Stewart leads an impressive cast on a terrifying ride. Stewart's performance is convincing and genuine, and she has some truly great scenes. Ironically, I think this film is more similar to The Abyss than Alien. Regardless, Underwater is a great action/suspense film, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",Underwater
863,mitchcap,Monster film done fairly well,7,9 June 2020,"Honestly this movie had some pretty solid acting in it for a monster movie and Kristen Stewart does a fairly good job carrying it. There were not a ton of cheesy lines that you typically have to hear in these movies(althought there were a couple). The action was evenly paced and did not drag on with a ton of monologue which I appreciate.

Am I supposed to know that the monster that comes out is Cthullu? How? For a graffiti that appears on a wall in a film frame?
The plot is void, everything is supposed to be secret, so much that they didn't even know what the movie was about.
The character that does not stop joking you completely out of the movie.

869,richhowardlopez,Lovecraft fans - this is what we've been waiting for. Disregard the uninitiated critics!,9,17 May 2020,"I didn't see much of the movie trailers, but I heard a lot of the #lovecraftian label being slung around when the movie came out. Eventually picked it up on Vudu, and I'm so glad it's in my collection. In fact, I think it's one of the best movies of 2020.It wastes no time in getting started. Lots of shots have incredible amounts of detail in them for those that pay attention, and follow scene-to-scene how those details connect. Lovecraft fans will notice a theme, and will pick up the sub-plot behind the scenes very quickly. Which adds to the excitement, and horror of the movie.For those not initiated in Lovecraft, you're going to miss a lot. It's going to seem like a simple horror movie, deep underwater, with potential scary monsters. And I can see how many average or negative reviews are coming from that. You will only ""get"" this movie if you've read some of the more popular H.P. Lovecraft works.Much like Lovecraft's works, I predict this movie will catch on later after home release. I hope it does.And if the movie seems muddy, and unclear, and chaotic at times - that's not lazy production. That's a nod to Lovecraft. Things are not meant to be clear. Things are meant to be insane, questionable, erratic.The sound-work further lends itself to this in it's horror sequences. And then in the calmer scenes lends itself to a confused contemplation. The theme of horror in the deep sea. The fear of the unknown. Dialogues between characters seem so natural. From banter between two characters pulling one out of the rubble, to lesser-sane moments of characters dragging each other across the bottom of the pitch black darkness.And the movie masterfully delivers a final act.Lovecraft fans - we're finally getting what we've wanted. We have The Color out of Space. and we have Underwater.""We shall dive down through black abysses ... and in that lair of the Deep Ones we shall dwell amidst wonder and glory forever"" -H.P.Lovecraft",Underwater
870,KinoSean,Surprisingly Not Bad,5,10 January 2020,"For a horror/thriller released in January, I was impressed. Kristen Stewart also pleasantly surprised me with her great performance. T.J. Miller's character was awful in the beginning, every time he opened his mouth he spewed out some attempt at humor which ruined the mood every time and felt very out of place. Just when I was starting to like his character he gets killed off (in a pretty cool way though). There was a constant feeling of claustrophobia and helplessness conveyed in the film that really helped enhance the atmosphere.

If you go into movies comparing it to another then nothing will ever live up to expectations. This movie is very good in my opinion. Of course we have seen this idea done before but quite honestly never really like this!This movie never gives you a break and never lets up on the action. You expect certain things out of this movie and quite often they have events that not many would expect.There are small things in the movie that hint to a bigger picture and dives deep into the characters we follow. Kristen Stewart gives a very good performance playing a strong character that cares deeply for her friends. All of the characters are very believable in there role. Even the jokester TJ Miller. He never takes the comic relief to a point where it becomes annoying.In conclusion, if you want to see this movie I suggest watching it without expectations or comparisons!

Lovecraft, but the film takes it too much in the direction of the Alien movies. The sea monsters are not that scary and the cast doesn't have enough interactions with them. The sea monsters are just there.
It's also not scary because the gore is minimized. Everything is too censorsed today for good horror films to come out. The characters are also one dimensional and come across as shallow people you don't really care to invest in.Reasons to watch it:It's an okay sci-fi/action film and is well cast, especially Stuart and Cassel. Ambitious movie in that it pays homage to the Alien franchise. At least it's more entertaining than ""Sphere"" with Sharon Stone. I loved the robotic, deep sea wetsuits used to navigate the terrain.
Kristen Stewart is mechanical but she's interesting to look at, and she spends the entirety of this showing off her waifish figure. She is good at these ""military roles."" She's got this androgyny that makes her attractive to men and women.",Underwater

888,haileymannix,It's an average but watchable Sci-Fi movie,6,14 August 2021,"The film is not as bad as the critics are claiming it to be.After watching I'm not 100% sold on the film being put into the horror category, so if you're going to watch it for that, I don't think this is the movie for you. However, it does fit the sci-fi tag quite well, along with being labeled a thriller.Within the first scene, the audience is drawn right into an action sequence, introducing two ""main"" characters along with the movie's central conflict so it doesn't take too long to get right into it.The acting and dialogue weren't horrible either, it allowed for some comedic relief while still seeming natural (especially considering the situations the character were in) but at some times it did lack a certain energy people look forward to within films (which did create a few awkward scenes but nothing too weird).Personally, I enjoyed most of the choices made by the director, except for the very cliche blackout still that happens in almost every single horror movie. I appreciated the slow-mo scenes with KS' character (once in the beginning, another towards the middle, and again in the end) - the color scheme was used fantastically, even though it could seem like an obvious choice, it felt very well fitted with the overall tone of the movie.Plot-wise, it's a very creative idea that piqued my interest before watching, but it felt half thought-out after watching. Most of that being structured on the fact that several elements were left untouched and unanswered after being used/seen throughout a large portion of the movie. It is also on the more predictable side, there were very few things that the audience might not see/get right away but nothing incredibly surprising - nevertheless it's still an interesting watch.If you look closely at the people behind the movie you will see (that during this time) they were more on the fresh side of filmmaking, so it's quite an impressive production to have under your belt early on.",Underwater

Kristen was terrible, dry and boring as usual. does she have any emotion at all?! her face, voice and tone stay the same no matter what is going on, it's so irritating! this movie was boring and predictable, total waste of time and money. very disappointing!",Underwater
890,networdcs,Don't hold your breath,2,16 February 2021,"This ""Alien"" rip-off is a CGI snooze-fest. The only scare was the first time the monster appeared. After that nothing. I remember thinking ""This guy just died a horrible death but I register no shock or horror, so sadness; just let's move this thing along, please."" And while they mention operating under a pressure of 8 tons per square inch (or whatever), they don't behave like it, except when it's time for one of the characters (straight out of central casting) to die. Totally unbelievable with monsters that don't ""monst."" Halfway through this movie I realized I'd seen it before, gotten bored and blown it off. This time I saw it through to the bitter (and predicable) end and wish I hadn't bothered. Fortunately, I borrowed it from the library so I didn't waste any money.",Underwater

At first, it was pretty exciting. Then the movie kinda takes a slow down of sorts. There are some dark scenes and shaking video shots that seem trite. T.J. Hunt is found early on and is supposed to be the comedic guy in the movie but I honestly didn't find any of it funny. The previews got me on this one. There are a couple good scenes in this movie, hence the 4 out of 10 stars. But, the end is pretty bad. It's not a 1 star like some suggest but it sure as hell isn't anything above a 5. The end completely ruined anything promising about the film. It left a lot of unanswered questions and there really isn't any character development to speak of. It was hard to care about any of the characters, and the end was horrendous. If nothing else is on, it's a okay time waster.",Underwater

All of which is understandable and it wouldn't be a bad thing if not for the fact that Underwater isn't just similar to those great film but it isn't any better. This film doesn't really bring anything new to the genre or concept of ""crew in an isolated place with little to no hope of an outside rescue while an unknown entity hunts them down."" Which is a shame because the entire cast actually does a great job of giving the impression of a close knit team and the special effects and direction are equally good. But everything else falls apart cause it's nothing we haven't seen done before and better. And yes there was the whole Cthulhu angle but even that was really explored in a satisfying way. I mean the ""old ones,"" are known for driving mortals insane by showing them that everything they know about existence is wrong right?

Slow plot, boring and predictable dialogues (like you can guess in every step what's going to happen), in other words, total cliche! At the end of the movie, you are left with lots of basic unanswered questions. Believe me, if I could take back this nearly 2 hours of my life I would.

934,fwsecond9876,"A Major Disappointment From The Director Of The Excellent ""The Signal""",5,26 April 2020,"I never thought Kristen Stewart was much of an actress. But she certainly surprised this reviewer with an excellent performance in ""Underwater."" Hers ranks up there with five-star performances in this genre from Sigourney Weaver, Linda Hamilton, Radha Mitchell, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Her character sweated bullets while still maintaining focus and using her knowledge to try to survive under extreme hardship, which the top actresses (listed above) have done in the best sci-fi/horror movies. So what a shame that her five-star performance was wasted in this so-so flick.I think character development is overrated in most thrillers, but this had embarrassingly little. At least the other actors took their cue from Ms. Stewart and did a good job displaying significant fear while at the same time trying to hold it together. And the movie almost redeemed itself in building tension and suspense until the monsters showed up, then things went quickly downhill. A monster would attack one of the five humans, then its compadres would hold back for some reason, and the reason was not shown or even hinted at. Their apparent hostility towards the human invaders of their space, combined with their formidable speed, strength, and agility could have easily enabled the monsters to quickly terminate all the humans whenever those humans were vulnerable when walking slowly outside of the various underwater facilities or vehicles. So a five out of ten is the best I can do here. Hopefully, Ms. Stewart will get another chance to star in a much better movie from this genre.",Underwater

The first time we get Cthulhu on the big screen and the movie flops.....or hear me out. This could have been an awesome concept for a Cloverfield prequel? Idk I'm disappointed.

938,andreiagut,How a potentially great film became a mediocre copy-paste generic horror flick,6,3 April 2020,"I'll keep this short. There are three main big issues besides the classic cliches and I'll start from least impactful to most impactful.
First, the use of the very popular so-called ""realistic"" lighting as opposed to having the lighting contribute to the atmosphere. The underwater scenes were great, but there's a lot of moments when it just doesn't give enough of a scary, tense vibe when it could easily do so (a lot of the red-lighting scenes are involved in this). This is also coupled with the last point which I'm going to make and which I believe to ruin this film completely.
Secondly, the jumps cares. Yes, the classic ""Boo! I'm suddenly in front of you!"", the bane of pretty much any good horror film. You just know that if a film has to actively rely on them, it's just not going to be good. The only two good ones were the one with the dead lady in the wreckage and the one on the illuminating platform, which wasn't much of a jump scare all-in-all.
And lastly, the thing that is by far the most horrendous crime committed in the past decade and more, when it comes to pretty much any piece of ""cinema"", if we can even call them that anyways: the over usage of ambiance music or whatever it's supposed to be called. It simply ruins everything. You have a potentially great tense and impactful scene? Why, lets just add some generic ""something spooky and totally not expected is going to happen"" track in the background!
This last point is my main issue, again besides all the generic hack cliches, because it's something that should be so easily avoidable and yet it finds its way into so many films. What for? It doesn't make the film any better and as far as I can tell it just speaks of poor decision making, too much haste and greed.
All in all, could have been a solid 8/10, but I'm not sure it's even worth a 6/10 as it is now. Darn shame, since it seems Kristen Stewart gets pulled into films that lack the directive vision to be any good, no matter how well she may act.",Underwater

946,marcusoshea-67401,Incoherent dialogue,3,3 April 2020,"I couldn't understand 90% of the dialogue in this film. I generally don't mind Kristen Stewart but in virtually every line she was either mumbling, stuttering or chaining her words together doublespeed. Fortunately the dialogue was so uninteresting it really didn't matter. I have a feeling the producers were counting on a scantily clad Stewart being a big draw card for male viewers but I doubt that's the case.Usually films like this spend a good 20 to 30 minutes setting up the characters and environment so you have some grounding and familiarity before the action starts. This film spend about 2 minutes before the action starts and you spend the rest of the film wondering if you missed the bit where you are meant to know who these people are. Stewarts character is a bit of a Mary Sue as well and just isn't believeable as the mechanical engineer action hero who seems to be the only competent person there. The are attempts to insert some humor and sentiment to help connect with the characters but you really don't care about them. In fact I spent most of the time hurrying them along so the movie would end. There are several scenes towards the end where people need to be running to save themselves and the characters literally just stand there doing nothing. The pod that can clearly fit two people in it is a bit of confounding too. In the end though none of it really matters because the film is complete trash.",Underwater

948,tinsel_head,Stewart wasn't actually bad,6,8 October 2020,"Normally when i know Kristen Stewart is starring a movie, i tend to try and avoid the project because I find her acting stiff and emotionless. This time I thought I would watch cause this movie actually didn't look half bad. I watched this movie based on a trailer and nothing more - therefore i wasn't exactly sure what to expect (probably the best way to go into movies). The film starts out with vibes of Alien, where a crew is isolated miles in a station and troubles ensue...as the films goes on the vibes switch into almost a Cloverfield feel. I honestly was thinking this movie might be a shark movie like Meg or maybe even just a survival against ourselves film - but it definitely changed into something much more.
I think people should take the chance on this cause the cast is actually pretty good, even Stewart, the story isn't half bad. The worst part is how the director chose to film the water sequences. They are blurred and dark - and with how action occurs it's almost impossible to make what's going on clearly.

Well I'll tell you why not, because it is one of the most abysmal movies I've seen for a very long time, and I watch some real crap!This had some real promise, the story isn't exactly original but as we have barely mapped 10% of the ocean floor who knows what's down there, so the premise of this movie was a good one. However, with not one iota of character development or explanation of what the heck was going on, I had to force myself to finish watching. I'm all for edgy camera angles, real lighting, and that kind of shaky effect; but when there is no explanation of what is going on it becomes exceedingly difficult to follow...

As an Alien clone (you know, running down alleyways, is that a shadow or something actually scary with a few jump scares along the way) Underwater is a perfectly enjoyable tick the box bit of escapism. Yet...Ok. Let's stick with Alien for a bit longer because it serves to highlight a couple of issues with Underwater perfectly. The writers of Alien knew that a build up gives time to develop the setting, understand your characters and ultimately create atmosphere. They also knew that if you show too much of the creature too early on then it begins to lose it mystery. And few things can be more terrifying than the blanks our minds fill in. Underwater just throws you in at the deep end (apologies) with only some brief news tidbits and character remarks to fill in the lore. And while the makers were initially hesitant to show what the protagonists are up against in Underwater, after they do, they then show the creatures at every available opportunity.It has all the trappings of an excellent, claustrophobic psychological horror and with creatures you crave to know more about. Yet it just goes down the quick rollercoaster adrenaline ride. Which is fine. It's 90 minutes long so it doesn't overstay it's welcome and it does a serviceable job at getting the pulse raising. But certainly, it is an opportunity missed.",Underwater

In the agronautic suits you can have only a bra and tangas. unless you are dude, then you can keep your tee and shorts on. And the suits must be taken on and off time and time again. Kirsten Stewart is a talented actress, no doubt. but the story she acts in is thin, the roles of her supporting cast is stereotypical and without any depth or backstory. and her clothing, it comes and goes, but mostly goes. when she, in one of the opening scenes, saves a guy's life from underneath a pile of concrete rubble he greets her as his ""flat chested faerie like savior"". i suppose it's in an attempt to convey the type of atmosphere she lives and work in. but since there is nothing else that adds to the picture, it's just mean, and pointless body shaming. presented as a good humored work place banter, delivered in a way that makes me feel like we are expected to laugh, and think the person who says it is quirky and charming. because kirsten just smiles at him, happy that her friend is his normal self again. just sheer poetry.

I won't find myself watching the bottom of the barrel slithering around the dark corners of streamers, but movies like ""Underwater"" and others you'd probably find on the ""If you liked this..."" section hold a special place in my heart. I'll at least give them a chance and I did with this.I will say that I was, indeed, pleasantly surprised by this one. I enjoyed William Eubank's last movie ""The Signal"" and this one takes most of the good bits from it and expands on them. Obviously he had more of a budget with this and it shows, but the CGI leaves a little to be desired. That being said I was a fan of what he was trying to do here. I found myself getting immersed in the little world on display here.You've seen this movie before. Eubank knows you have, but he still runs with it. I feel like this is a case where that sweet balance is struck. It's familiar, but the kind that you welcome. However, the third act completely took me by surprise. It's what bumped this up to a 7 for me. I was reminded of ""Cabin in the Woods"" but a good way.The acting was all fine. Kristen Stewart and TJ Miller were the most enjoyable.

Is that cute little Bella from Twilight? And why does Hollywood insist on killing off the black member of the group first? That guy's pretty funny, let's kill him off. And let's make the captain like Jacques Cousteau. The writers could have worked harder, and some consistency (like whether eyes make any sense at that depth - yes, or no, guys, you don't get both).That is not to say that the writers were not clever or unlettered.

969,Lambeteja,Underwater -Mysterious creatures terrorize crew members aboard a research station located seven miles below the surface of the ocean.,9,12 January 2020,"""Underwater"" is the kind of no-nonsense B-movie with an A-list cast that Hollywood used to make more often. It's a lean and mean film that gets you into its action instantly and then doesn't release the pressure until the ending credits.In an era of increasingly long blockbusters with pretensions of greatness, it's refreshing to see a tight movie that knows exactly what it needs to do and sets about doing it. Anchored by another impressive performance from Kristen Stewart and really effective cinematography from Bojan Bazelli, ""Underwater"" absolutely bullies you into liking it.There's no time not to. Some of the midsection succumbs to incoherent effects in which the murky setting overwhelms the ability to actually be able to tell what the heck is going on, but the flaws of the film never linger long enough to, sorry, sink ""Underwater.""Stewart plays Norah, a worker on an underwater research site that's literally miles below the surface. An annoying opening narration that feels tacked on by a producer during the film's delayed post-production details how time starts to lose all meaning when you're that far underwater. There's no light and you sometimes can't even tell if you're awake or dreaming.Just about then, while you're still trying to find your seat in the theater, all hell breaks loose. The hull of the rig starts to crack and explode. Norah runs to safety, eventually finding other survivors that include characters played by Vincent Cassel, Mamoudou Athie, John Gallagher Jr., Jessica Henwick, and T.J. Miller.That's it. It's six people trying to survive a catastrophe that has killed the hundreds of other people aboard the site. No shots of emergency crews on the surface. No flashbacks. The escape pods have either been used or destroyed. Their only hope is to literally walk a mile along the ocean floor to another site and hope there are pods that work there. Then they discover they're not alone.Yes, ""Underwater"" is half disaster movie and half monster movie, combining two B-movie genres that I've always loved. As ""Underwater"" shifts from something more akin to ""The Poseidon Adventure"" to a submerged riff on ""Alien,"" the transition doesn't always work but director William Eubank directs his cast to incredibly strong in-the-moment performances that hold it together. We need to believe Norah's plight, and Stewart sells the immediacy of her waking nightmare, well-assisted by Henwick and Cassel in particular.(On the other hand, Miller's schtick gets old fast, but that's the only weak link). The writers tack on a few too many manipulative back stories to try to heighten the emotional stakes, but that's commonplace in both genres on which ""Underwater"" is riffing.It also helps that the producers of ""Underwater"" tapped the eye of the great Bojan Bazelli to shoot the film. The cinematographer behind ""A Cure for Wellness"" and ""The Ring"" knows how to build tension with a combination of extreme close-ups that put us inside Norah's helmet while never losing the geography of where these people are fighting against incredible odds.When the movie becomes a full-out monster flick, Bazelli and Eubank could have dialed down the underwater murk a few degrees, but it's still an effective film visually, the value of which cannot be understated. Most bad B-movies like ""Underwater"" rely on a steady diet of jump scares and shaky camerawork to disguise their low budgets and lack of visual acuity. What sets this apart is that there's an artistry to the visuals and captivating sound design.The film is filled with flashing lights of broken or breaking equipment and the din of metal creaking under the pressure of water. It's all necessary to enhance the tension.What I think I responded to the most in ""Underwater"" is its relentlessness. It's almost real time for at the least first chunk of the movie, and the immediacy of the filmmaking gives it power. ""Underwater"" discards all that on-the-surface nonsense that worse movies would have forced viewers through, in which we meet the characters and foreshadow weird happenings underwater.There's no time for that. Don't show up late. It's a film that's about panic, and how unexpected heroes can be made through instinctual response to adversity. That, and underwater monsters.The final act of ""Underwater"" will likely divide some people, but I'm a fan of when a B-movie really goes for it, and there are a few beats in this one's final scenes that are impressively ambitious.My kids are at an age where they're fascinated by the idea that there could be species so far below the ocean's surface that we have yet to identify them. When they're old enough, I'll show them ""Underwater."" Maybe they'll like B-movies too.",Underwater

I get it, you don't always need to see the monster for it to be threatening, but this film seems to go out of its way to try and show you what the crew are up against, but someone has turned the lights off and simply said 'not happening!'There's a conflict of camera work against film direction that just turns this into a bit of a jarring mess.Worth a watch if you want a cheap popcorn flick, but for horror/monster fans, look elsewhere.",Underwater

979,priestlyggt,Absolute travesty. Insult to Alien and sci-fi/horror as a whole.,2,28 January 2020,"TL;DR: No character development whatsoever, no world building, no exploration of antagonists, no memorable moments, nothing made sense. Okay VFX.This movie had potential, although when it went from 0-100 within the first few minutes of the movie with no foreshadowing or explanation as to why, I knew I've just been jipped. After those first few minutes the movie takes place almost entirely in darkness, unable to see anything aside from the lights on the characters' diving suits or other lights on the facilities scattered around the ocean floor.The ""monsters"" are never explored and just serve to accomodate a cheap jumpscare and be the obligatory antagonist for Kristen Stewart to inevitably overcome while being one of the last survivors on this doomed research facility (which you still know nothing about).Characters were non-existent. You never see anyone alive outside of the main crew, and I didn't know anyone's name until the credits rolled. I recognized a couple actors and a couple voices, none of which were very good or delivered their material with any sort of care or enthusiasm.The biggest thing I felt was confusion as I had nothing but questions. What research happens at this station? Who are any of these characters, why are we focusing on them, and why should I care about them? What are these weird creatures that are stalking them throughout the movie? Were the creatures responsible for the station tearing apart, or was it really just an earthquake? What happened after the last two escaped? Neither of them ever tried to expose what happened? You might say just watch the movie and it'll answer everything; too bad none of these questions are ever addressed.Looking at some other reviews here and it is blatantly obvious who was paid to review this movie. The absolute audacity to compare this movie to the likes of Alien is an insult to that legendary movie and the entire sci-fi/horror genre. It's not 'better than expected', it's not a 'must watch', it's not memorable, it's not impactful, it's not even coherent. It's barely a shell of a narrative that deserves every bit of harsh criticism that comes its way.

It only exposes THEIR discomfort with accepting people who are different and don't meet the lame, antiquated, and discriminatory standards, of conventional femininity and beauty, imposed upon actors in Hollywood.Critiquing her acting?

1007,whitewolf-51555,A turn of the century potential ruined by a horrible lead actress,2,3 December 2020,"I don't know how you take an almost completely perfect horror environment and mess it up but some how they did. The first mistake was casting the most stale, dull actress. They introduce the disaster quicker than a unsolicited picture on snapchat, they introduce characters that you're supposed to like with the weakest back story thats barely eluded to and make it seem you've known them for years. How in the world do you bomb a perfect movie set up? I'm just astonished. The CGI was at best early 2000s quality and completely overwhelms most of the show. The monster makes absolutely no sense and completely takes away from the horror. Never, ever cast Stewart in your movie if you want it to be anything other than what the dog makes in the morning on its walk. The only reason this movie got its two star review from me was the the stuffed rabbit and the originality of the suits and location.",Underwater

Inexplicably humanoid, inexplicably hostile and surprisingly determined sea creatures attack crew of an undersea drill rig. I think - it was hard to tell. Creatures make that inevitable jump-scare screechy sound, even though it's 6 miles underwater and this sound makes little acoustic sense. Kirsten channels Ripley, down to the skinhead and skimpy attire towards the end, and the other Alien cast member types are duly represented. Having discovered fascinating new life forms hitherto unseen, people proceed to nuke them because they are big and scary-looking, and basically in order to save a couple of...people. Sadly, that was the most realistic and believable aspect of all.",Underwater

The final insult to Nature was the monstrosity at the end! What did the creator of this film think they would live off of? No creature can live in those depths and move fast, the pressure would rip them apart like it did the Captain (Love Vincent; first time I saw him was in Eastern Promises with Viggo Mortensen, incredible film especially Viggo's performance) ! Human beings are ripping this planet apart and I can only think the point of this movie was a GIANT WARNING, as if we need anymore warnings!!!

Those statements are just unnecessary.In the end you don't have to be Einstein to acknowledge this is not the best movie of it's genre, but if you clear your mind and watch this flick without forcing yourself to compare it to anything, then I can assure you immersive suspense.

1023,Azaiu,Quality & Suspense,10,5 October 2021,"Thoroughly enjoyed every moment from start to finish, which is difficult to find these days.It kicks off fast, you are not left waiting through 40 minutes of dialogue, thrown in the deep end immediately. Underwater cleverly denies us of any cheesy character build up instead the backgrounds are siphoned in throughout the movie at more convenient intervals.Don't go into it expecting a horror unless being underwater particularly gets to you, there are however horrible creatures lurking in the depths which are at the route of the incident.We have expendable people working for a greedy corporate -very relatable, the characters were not introduced in the conventional manner, the film puts you into it first person alongside the actors which do a great job of keeping the flow comfortably immersive.What you should notice is the quality they put into the set / outfits / design where everything is very polished to a high level, it's quite beautiful and something to be appreciated, on a standpoint it's AAA game design where everything you see is hand crafted to perfection and it could easily be adapted from / to that format.The direction and journey is realistic, suspenseful at times intense with a breath of fresh air and relief when they make it to each checkpoint.The actors were situationally believable and I didn't see a misplaced smirk or reason to dislike any of the characters, I wanted them all to survive, I really wanted them to live.

1024,gawencrow,Claustrophobic anxiety ridden stress fest!,7,2 August 2020,I've seen some low ratings on this film but I feel it is a solid effort from the cast and director. Kristen Stewart gives a great performance and in my opinion proves yet again that she has a broad range. The story is light on details but that is because this is a tension driven monster movie. The claustrophobia is palpable from the very beginning. I love how the characters are put in extremely high pressure mental situations while also physically being under immense pressure from being almost seven miles down in a tin can on the bottom of the deepest place in the ocean. That juxtaposition keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. The sets and CGI are very well done as well. A very fun film.

I don't care about character development, because that is not the point. The characters are just pawns, means to an end. The only thing I didn't like was the ending and the little to no human insanity. A Great Old One cannot be killed. We can only see the portion of his existence that is placed in our dimension, as it is a multiple dimension creature. That said, the movie was descent and was scientific accurate. For instance, the fact that in great sudden pressures, matter explodes, hence the character explosions as soon as they were exposed to the underwater pressure.

I rated it 9 out of ten stars because the ending, although quite successful, still gave me the impression that the director of the film, for various reasons, forced the end of filming ...
I know that somewhere we would have wanted a total ending of happy, I know the power of human sacrifice
it comforts us somewhere and maybe that's why my impression can be subjective ...
I don't understand how the visor of the diver's suit was broken with great weight by a steel container but those huge and strong jaws of the monster fail this, but, of course, this is a little for the capricious ...
I notice the appearance, I say, of the original appearance of marine life at 10,000 meters in the dark depths of the waters.
I was very pleasantly impressed by all the actors and actresses who enlivened the characters of the film, but also by the film crew that made spectacular scenes! In fact, the whole team behind this production really deserves congratulations!

It doesn't drag along or slow down at all, has really nice slow modes & camera work for sure & the biggest down side was that it wasn't longer because I wasn't ready for it to end. The unknown has always frightened & fascinated & that's what I got & I loved it.

But contradicting to my speculation, it slowly loses my interest throughout the journey: It does not have a decent screenplay. I wish the script would have more space for character development, such as Norad herself, the relationship between Norad and Captain; with other crew members. Furthermore, an explanation of the existence of those creatures and drill operation should have been a great addition. It (the subcontext) makes the plot stronger and more relatable. For me, the solid thriller film has to understand where to build up the tension and where to relieve it so that the audience can take a breath after a while. However, this movie has a constant action pace with shaky camera movement, those plain pseudoscience conversations and excessive scences without any meaning adding to the plot, makes it really hard to experience the whole thing. So much potential, unless a waste of time.",Underwater

The CGI is quite slick and the cinematography is impressive, although it's edited in a choppy way that makes YOU feel a little claustrophobic. Kristen Stewart also headlines this film with a rock-solid performance and despite a wasted Vincent Cassel, T.J. Miller is terrific in his supporting role, bringing the comic relief. Think of it as Alien underwater, or principally The Abyss with few changes. One of them being a massive Kraken-type monster to fight towards the end of the film. Yeah, they jumped the shark.

1059,bloodofayoungwolf,Awkward Medley,3,15 January 2020,"Don't get me wrong The Signal was a fantastic movie. This was frustrating.This however was a mess. It took the plot of several other stores ie. Dead Space, Cloverfield, Alien, The Abyss, and Pitch Black merged them all together and managed to some how fail.The lack of science used was brutal. No one around could explain anything about the organisms.A ton of nonsensical plot tangents that even a suspension of disbelief could aid. The character development was stale and not one of them will grow on you. Way too heavy on the CGI. CGI does not build the atmosphere you think it does.Whatever writer managed to make T.J Miller unfunny as well, I'm impressed.When I saw The Signal I thought ""Man this director is going somewhere."" I really hope he comes out and tells us there's an uncut version of Underwater that is twenty times better and the studio nuked his child here.I thought it was strange an underwater suspense movie was an hour thirty. Usually anything good in space or underwater horror needs a lot of time to build the suspense and dread. Instead of building it, it focuses on jump scares.My final disappointment with this was the darkness and cutaways from anything interesting about to happen.I highly doubt this is salvageable on any kind of editing floor but you should definitely go back and watch The Signal instead. Hopefully Eubanks doesn't get bounced out of Hollywood so he can get another crack at making something solid again. Good SciFi directors are something scarce lately.TLDR watch The Signal, skip this.",Underwater

The characters are also good and I dont expect much twist from the beginning so it turns out okay.
Some people complain about acting but I dont know what should be done anyway, I saw somebody even compare it to The Abyss 1989, it's really horrible nowadays when people compare movies in the old decades and even to tell the old one is better? Look at how we have advanced in all the scenes and cinema effects, details, we even have better looking actors and actresses so just a bit of cliche content shouldnt bring this movie below 5.

Exactly what was it that happened to the fiancé?I'd stick to watching The Abyss.",Underwater
1067,miroorton,I Think this one of bad movies ever,3,7 June 2020,"I give this movie 3/10 for he story this movie has a good idea they working on but the director can not used this for the movie
the act was very bad except Vincent Cassel he was good
the vfx was bad",Underwater

1069,muddkipzliberty,Needs another 30 minutes of context.,6,3 May 2020,"The concept for this story is very interesting, I feel the only major thing missing is another 30 minutes if background information and context. Its like you started watching a movie 20 minutes in. We already know what's happening, but what I want to know is why. If it was too much work to flesh out a back story they should have just left out the monsters all together and made it a straight escape movie to cut out the lingering questions and confusion. Maybe we'll get an extended cut that'll actually make sense",Underwater
1070,guerreirosonialopes,Why?,3,6 April 2020,Why does a monster that live in a place with no light have eyes? Why doesn't the story have any back bone? Why did you have to spit on Aliens face? So many questions...,Underwater
1071,genessaleekush,Um....wtf?,1,11 January 2020,"Wow. We actually left after an hour of this movie. If you want a movie that does a close up of Kristen Stewart's painful face every 10 minutes then this is for you. Absolutely zero character development. There are spots that end abruptly and leave you with, how the the hell did they get there? Makes NO sense!!!!!! So many questions needing answers to this pathetic attempt at a movie. I was actually mad when we left early.",Underwater
1072,elduran-50863,Underrated movie,10,24 April 2020,His movie is great from start to finish it is just survival and any one is fair game.,Underwater
1073,nuno_teixeira_slb,It's not that bad....,7,3 April 2020,"The movie starts the action a little sooner than expected, a lot of characters die...But, I still consider it to be more or less a good story, the monsters are cool, there's also 2 suprises at the end, one being the ending (not really a suprise) and the other involving the monsters...Although all my fav. movie characters die, all in all it's a good movie for scares and agressive deaths....",Underwater

1075,facebook-86687,Made me jump more than once,8,16 February 2021,On the edge of my seat through virtually the whole film. There were several times it made me jump and other times I realised I wasn't breathing. It is quite a simple story and the reason for the disaster is a bit over the top. I think there was scope to give the film more depth of content but it was a very enjoyable 90 minutes or so,Underwater
1076,latinaitalia,Better than expected,9,16 December 2020,"Good movie, Alien meets Poseidon Adventure. It's a movie full of unexpected twists and turns.",Underwater
1077,briannecbrooks,Embarrassing,2,9 May 2020,"This movie was... embarrassing. There's no backstory. Throws you into the action without any explanation of what's going on. Plot lacks a time frame that makes any sense. No characters being defined, who are they and what are they doing there. It's just some people in a bad situation without any clear plot.",Underwater
1078,jerryravensdale,Doesn't Hold Water,3,11 April 2020,"I saw a fish.... he stole the show.
At least there wasn't pretty vampires.
Have a nice day😀",Underwater
1079,tklimos,Terrible,2,23 January 2020,"First of all they never explain why these people are underwater. You don't know what their actual job is. Drill for what and for what reason? The beginning credits show articles that kinda tell you stuff but they flash by so fast you can't read it properly. It literally starts out with chaos, no character building, no back story, no reasons or explanations just boom Underwater rig is leaking. You don't care about the characters because you haven't learned anything about them or what they are doing.
I didn't have high expectations but I hoped it would be entertaining. Maybe like The Abyss, which I loved. Well it wasn't entertaining it was just dumb. The mystery of the creatures in the water that appeared to be hunting them was ok right up until you saw the creatures then it was like wtf is that, looks like a mutated human at the bottom of the ocean. Ridiculous! Just when you think how much worse can it get , low and behold there is a giant version of the creature that looks even stupider than the small ones.
Bad acting, no real story line, cheesy ass sea monsters, just a none entertaining pointless mess.",Underwater
1080,syamaviswanath,Cliche movie,3,29 April 2020,"A cliche creature movie , too boring at times.
Only a diehard Christian Stewart fan can watch this without banging your head on the lost two hours of your life.",Underwater
1081,zakhinchliffe,Underwater,7,21 December 2020,"Enjoyable. Its very much Alien meets Deep Blue Sea (with Tj Millers Jokes in place of the awful 90's movie garbage). The underwater scenes are far too murky to see what's going on half the time and the ending could've been better but over all it's a entertaining watch.Also don't be put off if you're not a fan of Kristen Stewart, she's actually pretty good in this.",Underwater
1082,veljoviikant,Nemesis underwater,8,11 June 2020,"Fast entry to unknown to a alien fight from depths in coolass suits. Miss Stewart really looks like young Ripley, well guess that was the idea. No logic needed just few cold ones and good company. Critics can kiss the... Just enjoy the movie.",Underwater
1083,bahamian,Video has RACIAL OVERTONES!!!!,2,11 May 2021,I am soooo sick of these typical hollywood movies that teaches viewers that Black people are not that smart and highly expendible!!!Notice at the beginning part of the movie how the Black guy goes ALL out to compliment the White lady on her genious and made it known that she saved the day and He being a Black man was not capable of saving the day!!! Not surprizingly like the typical hollywood movie the Black guy is most useless and expendible and is killed off first.I turned the TV off afterward. Enough of that bull!!!,Underwater
1084,minasgr-89521,i did not hope for much...,1,21 January 2020,"But i got nothing at all!!!
this movie is boring A.F. one would think that this girl who has been acting since she was ten years old or something would have learned how to act by now....but no.
not a single moment in this movie was entertaining to me.
she is a sight to behold in her little outfit near the end of the movie but thats just about it. in fact all the actors where un-interesting and none of them make you care for the character they play.
big flop!",Underwater
1085,hswhttgr,One Time Watch,6,2 December 2020,The Story line is not that good..... but the suspense is the great. Don't expect many action in this movie. Hence I mentioned 'One Time Watch ',Underwater
1086,sanders-64754,Kept me interested!,8,16 January 2020,"Apparently everyone is a movie critic and some were super hard on this movie but I found it to be action packed from the first couple of minutes and it kept my interest the entire time! If the preview for the movie seems like something you would like, then you will enjoy it!",Underwater
1087,tasteslikedoge,Great movie!,10,19 April 2020,"Glad I didn't listen to all of these people leaving bad reviews. I really enjoyed the movie. Yes, it did grab some ideas here and there from other movies. But, if you want to go that route, then no movie out there is original anymore.
Some other big budget movies have had worse story telling, acting and CGI.
My takeaway is, if you like sci-fi and enjoyed movies like Alien or The Abyss, then give this movie a shot. You definitely won't regret it.
Really wish people could leave some positive things in their reviews instead of bashing the movie and pointing out everything they didn't like about it.Again....Thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it.",Underwater
1088,nuzphtg,Not a PG-13 Movie,6,26 January 2020,"Clearly should have been rated 'R"" based on sensual images, language used, and intense imaging with fright and gore.",Underwater

Lomg lasting suspense & fear. Full of Dark, and dark creatures. Braveness and bold characters. I love these type of movies where there is a strong fight to live against die. ""Do or Die"" !!!

1090,Jasonsbrannon,No character development,5,19 January 2020,The people posting reviews of 8 and 9's are clearly paid to post positive reviews. The film has literally no character development. No 20-30 minutes to get to know people. The result is the start of the film is pretty much the trailer. The rig is in trouble in the first 5 minutes. You don't really care about anyone in the film as you never got to know them. Imagine in the first Alien if the film began with the Alien fully grown on board. I think 6 stars is generous.,Underwater
1091,ellemacmurray,Underwater,7,17 January 2020,"The film wasted no time jumping right into the catastrophe that the crew experiences. The duration of the movie had me on the edge of my seat, awaiting to see who would make it to the end or not. Not nearly as violent as it could've been, it had a fair share of jumps and disturbing images. The last 20 minutes really didn't satisfy my need as a viewer, and wish that they had scrapped it and ended it differently. With subtle homage to Ripley Scott's alien, the movie was over all a fun suspenseful thriller. But definitely save it for streaming or renting.",Underwater
1092,m_gutierrez-56688,Great,10,30 May 2020,My wife and kids loved it not what we expected didn't even know anything about it hitting theaters better late then never like to see what happens after like a start to something big,Underwater
1093,zou-hair,Alternatieve version off; Alien's Ellen Ripley,7,30 March 2020,"Great movie. If you were a fan of the Alien movies with signoury Weaver. This movie is had great similiarities to it, only the surroundings are not in space but down in the sea. It is not as great as the Alien franchise, but still trilling good to watch the outcome of this movie. Suprising good avond my expactation till the end.",Underwater

1095,samchungyong-36215,Horrific in almost every sense,2,20 April 2020,"Pros. Some of the special effects were impressive.Cons. No back story, in fact nothing is explained at all. No character development. Bland acting. Predictable story. Often unclear what's happening on screen. And (spoiler) at the end the humans completely destroy the natural habitat and for some reason that's seen as a good thing.",Underwater
