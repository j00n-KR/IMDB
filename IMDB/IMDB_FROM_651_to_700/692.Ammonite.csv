0,SnoopyStyle,OMG clutching my pearls,6,18 July 2021,"It's 1840's Britain. Reclusive paleontologist Mary Anning (Kate Winslet) lives with her sick mother and sells fossils she finds on the rocky beach. She is well known even in London although one get a sense that she is often dismissed. Roderick Murchison has come to hire her and learn at her feet. He has brought his sick wife Charlotte (Saoirse Ronan) to recover with the sea air.This movie became a joke somewhere but I don't recall where. The joke is basically that this movie is just another Victorian lesbian couple trying to have an affair. This repetitive trope is getting tiresome. There is nothing new here. There is nothing that bad either. There is also no real great danger to these two ladies. They don't even allow the maid to raise the temperature. It does have two great top-level actresses and it looks beautiful. Sadly, it doesn't add anything new to the conversation.",Ammonite
1,lee_eisenberg,outstanding movie,10,25 October 2021,"I had never heard of Mary Anning or Charlotte Murchison before watching ""Ammonite"". Even though this is a speculative movie, it's one excellent piece of work. Seeing Charlotte's loveless marriage - she pretends to be asleep so that she won't have to have sex with her husband - it's no wonder she'd seek a relationship elsewhere. And of course, another thing made clear by the movie is that Mary's role in finding the fossils got suppressed by the museum.Complementing the solid story, Kate Winslet's and Saoirse Ronan's performances reaffirm them as two of the greatest actresses of our era. Everyone should see this movie.",Ammonite
2,CinemaSerf,Looks wonderful but falls short.,6,18 October 2020,"This is a beautifully crafted piece of work from Francis Lee and Stéphane Fontaine that depicts the rather downtrodden existence of 19th century English paleontologist Mary Anning (Kate Winslet) who spends much of her time combing the beach for shells and fossils that she restores and sells in a small shop she shares with her ailing mother (Gemma Jones). The arrival of the enthusiastic Roderick Murchison (James McArdle) and his wife Charlotte (Saoirse Ronan) changes her pretty breadline, dreary, routine as he, initially, pays her to show him how to spot the ammonite but then leaves his poorly wife in her care to recuperate from an as yet undefined malady. The story is essentially about how the two women bond, and about how that bond intensifies and it features two very strong performances from the leads who struggle with their delicately smouldering relationship. Together with Lee, they manage to deliver a sense of their longing in a largely un-passionate - yet not sterile - fashion. The snag is that the film really, really, lacks pace and characterisation. It's not that is needs to be a full-on sex-fest, it's that their dialogue is sparing to the point of frugality. Why do they bond? At times their affinity is hard to fathom; terse even - and there is a maternal affinity that seems to compromise the potency of their chemistry as people who are falling in love. There are a couple touching contributions from Fiona Shaw and Gemma Jones (sort of reprises her role from ""God's Own Country"" (2017)) and there is an explicit swipe at the male-driven scientific community that did it's best to discourage/ignore the obvious skills possessed by Anning, but as a film for the big screen it just lacks depth - we are left to guess/assume way too much and it left me feeling just a bit empty.",Ammonite
3,evanston_dad,Trying to Make Fossils Sexy,5,8 February 2021,"Can fossils be sexy? This movie answers that question for us: No.Well, maybe they can. But not as presented here. I already saw this movie, and it was called ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire."" Except that movie was way better.Look, Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan are both excellent actresses, and just one of them in a film would be justification for watching it no matter what it's about. But both of them are undermined by this dreary movie about the volcanic passion that erupts between a taciturn scientist (Winslet) and a young neglected wife (Ronan) staying with her in a quiet seaside village. Except that nothing is volcanic or passionate about their relationship. The film is so strangled by its determination to be taken seriously that no one's given any room to breathe. It's as if the director felt that the slightest bit of pizazz would hint at frivolity. I wasn't even asking for levity, because God forbid -- I was just asking for something to alleviate the trudging procession of static, grayish scenes.Winslet and Ronan have no chemistry together, which is the final nail in this film's coffin. In their explicit sex scenes together, the two actresses go about the motions like two professionals doing a job.Grade: C",Ammonite
4,ferguson-6,a rock of hope,7,12 November 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""Peanuts"" creator Charles Schulz injected ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown"" (1966) with downtrodden Charlie repeating the line, ""I got a rock"" after each house on the trick or treat trail. It was funny because no one would rather have a rock than candy, right? Well, maybe no one except Mary Anning, the 19th century English fossil collector and paleontologist whose story is at the core of writer-director Francis Lee's (GOD'S OWN COUNTRY, 2017) new film. His latest film has received some backlash due to the fictionalized approach it takes with her personal life.Oscar winner (plus 6 other nominations) Kate Winslet stars as Mary Anning, and we first find with her living a quiet life of near solitude in Lyme Regis, a sea side town in West Dorset, England. Having never received her deserved recognition from the scientific community for her discoveries, Mary cares for her mother (Gemma Jones, who also played Winslet's mother in SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, 1995), an elderly woman burdened with having watched 8 of her 10 children die before her. They eke out a living peddling the stones Mary finds and polishes to tourists. Mary rarely speaks and her face shows the wear and tear of a mostly joyless life.One day, Rodrick Murchison (James McArdle, MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS, 2018) drops into the shop. As a fellow scientist, he is aware of and interested in Mary's work. He condescendingly introduces his wife Charlotte (4 time Oscar nominee Saoirse Ronan) as suffering from ""melancholia"". When Charlotte falls ill, Rodrick asks Mary to look after her while he continues his travels. Dr. Lieberson (Alec Secareneau, AMULET, 2020) examines Charlotte and recommends rest and sea air. He also takes notice of Mary, an occurrence to which she pays little mind.The contrast between Charlotte and Mary is not limited to age and class. They aren't particularly fond of each other initially, though Mary slowly nurses her back to health. The two ladies finally connect over a heavy rock half-buried in sea wall sediment. The evolution of their relationship is slow, but thanks to the two outstanding actors, it's quite something to watch. Ms. Winslet is particularly affecting as the woman beaten down by life and reluctant to allow any glimmer of hope. We see this in her interaction with neighbor Elizabeth Philpot (Fiona Shaw), a woman with whom there was a previous bond. The old saying goes, ""opposites attract"", and here the two opposites, Mary and Charlotte, bring out the best in each other.The skilled actors never allow the film to slide into melodrama, and instead offer two occasions where unbridled emotion jump off the screen. A passionate and liberating love scene is the first, and then a later re-connection provides the second. Mostly, Mary forces herself to conceal her rare happiness - we wonder if this is due to her belief it won't last, or if it's because she feels unworthy. Either way, it's quite something to watch Ms. Winslet allows us to sense what's she's experiencing inside.Music from Voker Bertelmann and Dustin O'Halloran never overpowers the moment, and the extremely talented cinematographer Stephane Fontaine works his magic. His previous work includes: JACKIE (2016), ELLE (2016), CAPTAIN FANTASTIC (2016), RUST AND BONE (2012), A PROPHET (2009), all beautifully filmed. Filmmaker Lee's controversial dramatic license with the relationship is apparently done to better explain Mary Anning's life, and it's likely the first film where new acquaintances connect in a deep way thanks to the unearthing of a unique rock. Filming took place in Lyme Regis, the actual town where Mary Anning collected fossils in the 1800's.",Ammonite
5,lasttimeisaw,Cinema Omnivore - Ammonite (2020) 7.9/10,8,5 December 2020,"""One of the chief sticking points from the negative feedback is leveled at the casting of two heterosexual name stars Winslet and Ronan and the lack of chemistry thereof, and indeed, the raw, libidinous impulse emanated from GOD'S OWN COUNTRY by two anonymous actors (Josh O'Connor and Alec Secareanu, the latter returns here as a courteous doctor with a dulcet foreign accent), is supplanted here by a more contained, stiff, distaff bond that takes more than an hour to build, since initially, Mary doesn't see eye to eye with Charlotte, the hothouse flower ilk who has no clue of how to scrape a carrot.""read the full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",Ammonite
6,Cineanalyst,Projection of a Lady on Fire,7,30 June 2021,"As others have intimated, ""Ammonite"" is rather an Anglicization of ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" (2019), and, sure, particularly given the sex of the filmmakers, a more male-centric variation, and, yes, it's not as good. The latter is such a masterpiece, though, that even its effigy, if you will, or fossilized remains--its replication of reproduction is telling. Once again, it's costume-drama lesbians on a rocky beach gazing at each other--one a hired professional respected in her field and the other's husband away. In the French film, this was all about art, including as if the entire picture was but another painting from the shared female gaze of the artist and the camera. Among other things, there was also the story-within-the-story of the Orpheus and Eurydice myth that reflected that gaze. Instead of painting, here, we get fossils. That doesn't have the same effect. Spectators may gawk at both in museums, but one is art and the other science. This is where ""Ammonite"" gets kind of clever.As a fictionalization of the historical paleontologist, the Mary Anning here also draws and writes, but beyond the amusement of the prospect of Kate Winslet reversing her role in ""Titanic"" (1997), this only goes to the picture's business with hands and touch. I also don't care for the unromantic trope of falling in love with unconscious women. The tactile bit is apt for archeology and sex, though, but not necessarily much for the visual arts. Ditto a quite good soundscape--I like the sounds of the sea, handiwork and such here. Anyways, the ultimate counterpart here to the French film is the heightened music--and even that romance cliché of being in the rain--as the women attend what we're initially lead to believe is but a musical concert. More than that, though, it's an exhibition of the magic lantern. It's the most scientific of the visual arts: projected pictures--and, later, movies. Reminds me of some books on the history of motion pictures with titles of ""Archaeology of the Cinema"" (e.g. Those by C. W. Ceram and Laurent Mannoni). A good place to begin for that history is with the magic lantern, the beginning of projecting pictures, including motion pictures. Cinema wasn't just born in front of popcorn-chewing audiences or coin-slotted peephole boxes, and even then it was at first largely the work of at least wannabe-scientist inventors. But, no, cinema was invented by hard-science, not even the social sciences, polymaths: Christiaan Huygens, Michael Faraday, Joseph Plateau, Simon Stampfer, Charles Wheatstone, Jan Purkyne, Jules Janssen, Étienne-Jules Marey.Point is, employing the magic lantern here was ingenuous. It was a scientific marvel to be gazed upon as much as were dinosaur bones. Note, too, how the entire scene is about looking, especially the scientist within the movie, who herself is gazing upon her love interest through another lens or screen, as it were, in the window. Quite the mise-en-abyme there. The rest of ""Ammonite,"" besides the corresponding ending, I could take it or leave it, but this scene works. I'm less fond of the more vigorous sex scenes to its French counterpart, the seeming ""head"" pun of the fossil find leading to that term for sex, as well as the related allusion to castration-anxiety psychobabble of the male gaze at the end. Note the earlier male frontal nudity contrasted to the statue, as well as the prior male portraits. Oedipus instead of Eurydice. It takes one out of the illusion of sharing the intimate gaze between the two women (by two wonderful actresses, by the way, in Winslet and Saoirse Ronan) and places us back within the traditionally-dominant cinematic male gaze as though we're intruding. The magic is gone. Hard not to compare that to the sustained success of the gaze to the very end of ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire.""",Ammonite
7,westsideschl,Mostly Inaccurate,4,23 February 2021,"British born in 1799 Anning's family home was next to the sea where she searched for fossils. A sometimes dangerous search in which one landslide killed her dog. It was a time when nearly half of children did not survive beyond age 5, and she too experienced most of her siblings early deaths. Fossil hunting & selling was common in her community. Mary was 12 when her brother found the ichthyosaur skull, and Mary, later, the rest of the skeleton. Still in poverty as Mary grew older one of her clients held an auction of fossils he had purchased from her to assist the family. She found many important fossils, but like most women she was ignored as a professional in the male dominant science world. She eventually gained enough money to buy a house. Well known, she had buyers from Europe & America. The film's emphasis with Charlotte Murchison was largely made up; both the romantic and Charlotte was already an experienced fossil collector. Basically near zero time was spent showing the arduous task of preparing a fossil. Sadly we see little of her collections & scientific community interactions where she was well known. She died at age 48.",Ammonite

10,henry8-3,Ammonite,7,24 October 2021,"Kate Winslet plays Mary Anning, a famous fossil hunter / palaeontologist with exhibits in the British Museum, who must now sell ammonites to tourists etc just to keep her and her mother, Gemma Jones, going. Into her life comes convalescing, well off Saoirse Ronan who stays with Winslet until she has recovered. A deepening relationship begins.Remarkably touching, beautifully acted - especially by Winslet - and nicely lean love story set against the backdrop of a drab, miserable 19th century Lyme Regis. The 2 leads make a completely believable couple and the affection is bought forward slowly and ultimately quite explicitly. It is a quiet gentle film with no obvious romance or great outpourings of emotion or melodrama and all the better for that. I loved the ending.",Ammonite

I am a viewer who can hang on to a slow moving narrative if I think there's going to be a payoff, so I wouldn't recommend this to those who like brisk pacing. The important part was that it made me care about the characters. I consider it an accomplishment any time two performers can believably be attracted to each other onscreen. This one made me feel genuine emotion for both leads. I really couldn't wait to see how it turned out.",Ammonite
13,masonfisk,A LOVE AFFAIR OUT IN THE OPEN...!,10,19 January 2021,"A current release starring Kate Winslet & Saoirse Ronan about a romance during the late 1800's England. Winslet & her mother, played by Gemma Jones (who co-starred w/Winslet in '95's Sense & Sensibility), live in a coastal town running a curio shop which specializes in found rocks & minerals Winslet forges from her daily excursions to the town's beach area. She's gained a bit of notoriety for having discovered the fossil remains of a rare dinosaur which she sold to the British museum. Into her life comes Ronan & her husband, who wants to join her on her journeys since he's now caught the 'bug' to venture out into the wilderness fancying himself an amateur archaeologist. Ronan is withdrawn & keeps to herself (a miscarriage or the death of her child is intimated but never explicitly spelled out) but when the husband decides to leave Ronan behind (he's called away on some business) for a few weeks, Winslet is none too happy to have an unwanted visitor. Soon enough, especially after a health scare finds Ronan laid up in bed, Winslet is forced to care for her (at the behest of a doctor who takes a fancy to Winslet) bringing Ronan out of her shell as she ventures forth w/Winslet to explore the beaches developing a romance along the way. We get hints Winslet was involved w/another woman, played by Fiona Shaw, but for whatever reason nothing ever came of it. Once a letter arrives alerting Ronan she has to return home, Winslet has to make a decision whether she's going to rejoin her stoic & isolated lifestyle or accept a place in Ronan's home (w/the husband still being somewhat of a presence). Never being the kind of story where their relationship is one conducted in secret out of fear of being caught, Winslet & Ronan find a nice give & take in a union which ultimately helps both parties emotionally & psychically w/an ending which could be construed as ambiguous as the two women have a big decision to make & this film won't show the outcome.",Ammonite

15,I_Ailurophile,"Quiet, unglamorous, but lovely",7,9 May 2021,"I think I had set my expectations a little too high before I started watching, what with stars of Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan's caliber involved. 'Ammonite' is mostly more understated than I would have anticipated, in every regard, though as historical fiction, that's an understandable approach to take. It has its flaws, yet is still enjoyable and worth watching.'Ammonite' is a little bit of a study in contrasts, as emphasized by the two leads. Mary Anning's life is depicted with purposeful and stark solitude, hard work, and a notably gritty, asocial personality - lacking in color, and vitality. This is the least glamorous role I think I've ever seen Winslet take on. Charlotte Murchison, meanwhile, carries a certain spark with her, and presumptuous amiability - while yet being unaccustomed to toil and hardship in the relatively opulent life she has known. Ronan gives her a definite sense of excited innocence befitting those characteristics.Unless viewers are particular fans of these historical figures or their fields, or of the cast, it's a fair guess that most are here for the speculative fiction part of the film, the depiction of a lesbian relationship between Anning and Murchison. It's a subtle, slow build, with very singular looks, or the delicate touch of a hand, forming the foundation. Compared to other movies with a similar narrative bent, it seems a bit out of character the first time that Winslet and Ronan kiss. And yet, isn't life also messy like that at times? The stars absolutely shine in this capacity, giving their characters and the affair a strength and intensity that is magnetic. Their intimacy reaches an enchanting crescendo of passion many comparable pictures don't seem to want to show on screen. And as one would rather hope, writer-director Francis Lee devoted much energy in the screenplay to the portrayal of their relationship.There's a small part of me, however, that feels so much time was spent ensuring Anning and Murchison's love affair was treated appropriately that the rest of the film suffered a bit as a result, as though such time and energy spent writing were a palpable, quantifiable resource. It's not that any one particular aspect leaps out at me as flawed, or underwritten - but nor does any aspect truly capture one's imagination, save for the love that Winslet and Ronan so gracefully portray. Like the skies and the sea throughout 'Ammonite,' much of the feature just seems a little dull and grey. There's nothing inherently wrong with how the plot is laid out; after all, if this is a study in contrasts, then there's no greater contrast than to light a great blaze for the central relationship and keep a single low candle aflame for the rest. Yet I can't help but feel that something's missing.It also has to be noted that 'Ammonite' somewhat falls into an all too familiar trap of representing a queer relationship that cannot last. One has already created speculative fiction that Anning and Murchison were involved; why not take it one step further? At least the real obstacle here is an intangible distance between the lives of the subjects, and not the heteronormative trope of ""they're married,"" but it's still regrettable. Imagine if every cinematic romance between a man and a woman were similarly doomed to failure by its screenplay.Still, despite its flaws, and despite a familiar failing - I will also say that the final scene is very, very well done. Though 'Ammonite' tiresomely imparts that the love affair can't last - the film's visual realization of the boundaries between the characters is given an exquisitely artful illustration. It's a bumpy ride, but the last stop along the way is truly commendable.'Ammonite' is worth watching, especially for the warmth and zeal that Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan give Anning and Murchison's intimacy. And, true, other viewers may find this even more appealing than I do - indeed, I want to regard 'Ammonite' more highly than I do. I say just to keep your expectations in check, because the picture is a bit uneven.",Ammonite
16,jadepietro,Love Among the Ruins,7,21 March 2021,"IN BRIEF: A 19th Century romantic story that celebrates gay love while avoiding the facts.JIM'S REVIEW (RECOMMENDED) Why do many period lesbian stories have similar M.O.'s: strong images, minimal dialog exchanges, a slow-moving story with furtive glances and suggestive touches, commanding performances of two attractive yet closeted lovers yearning for a mere caress, all artfully presented? Last year's superior Portrait of a Lady on Fire successfully followed that gay formula to very impressive results; Francis Lee's gay romance tale, Ammonite, does not come near that French film's artistry, but it does have many compelling scenes due to the subtle acting of its two leads that more than holds your interest.The life of British paleontologist Mary Anning (Kate Winslet) is on full frontal view although there has been much speculation about her sex life and her possible lesbian tendencies. Still, the main thrust of the movie is the unproven relationship between Mary and her female discovery, Charlotte Murchison, played by Saoirse Ronan rather than Ms. Anning's more famous archaeological discoveries. While both actress are splendid in their roles and the film sensitively depicts their clandestine love affair, one cannot deny that it plays loosely with the facts.The conflict of illegal gay secret love weighs heavily on the film's narrative. Mr. Lee's screenplay seems far more interested in the lesbian tell-all love story than the historical relevance of this scientist and her deeds. The writer/director digs deeper into their so-called complex relationship and creates compelling characters who are introspective and vulnerable while avoiding melodramatic moments. It all feels real, especially the passionate love-making scenes that are startlingly candid and honest in their impact. Nothing feels gratitious, just very natural which is to the credit of Mr. Lee's solid direction. Still the lack of real facts does blur the line too often and intrude on the storytelling aspects, despite the excellent acting by the lead actresses.Ms. Winslet vividly creates a multi-faceted woman who internalizes her character's frustration and solitude quite effectively. She fills her lonely days with her love of fossils and her amorous nights with her new paramour as an act of societal defiance. Ms. Ronan offers a nuanced portrait of a younger lady who may not be on fire, but, at least, she is willing to combust on her journey to female independence and lovemaking. Their budding romance prevails over their Victorian prudishness and make the movie more riveting. Kudos to both actresses for making bold choices to stage their explicit lovemaking sessions with total honesty and complete disregard for any Puritan taste. Fine support is also given by the talented British actresses Gemma Jones and Fiona Shaw in smaller but pivoting roles.But the movie does have serious pacing issues and it rarely celebrates Ms. Anning's scientific accomplishments. This limited point of view becomes a major faux pas in a script that would rather stress sexual conjecture and bedtime tales than state the proven facts about this female scientist's contributions to world of paleontology. In Ammonite, more passions are unearthed than artifacts and the truth is still a rare commodity. (GRADE: B-)",Ammonite

Lyme Regis is one of the most beautiful places on the planet but we had no sense of this.Kate Winslett was just universally rude and cold to everyone for no reason whatsoever.

A dominating sexual history story based on absolutely no facts about Mary Anning whatsoever, this is morally repugnant on any level.It was slow slow slow and then stop, and seemingly the only way we were going to see any fossil would be if was trapped down Soairse Ronan corset.

21,AngelHonesty,"Why, Just Why?",3,7 February 2021,"I am a big fan of lesbian movies and love stories in general, but this was beyond disappointing. There is very little chemistry between Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan. The love story itself starts off way to abrupt, you go from them not even talking to each other, to suddenly for no reason, giving each other the lustful looks and grazing touch that quickly turns to sex. There is very few words in the entire movie which is exhausting as you barely get to discover the characters and their depth, backstories or really anything about them. You sorta get an idea of why Charlotte is depressed but they barely talk about it or bring it out. Her suddenly focusing all her energy on another person is not going to make everything better, she still needs to deal with those issues that was making her depressed to begin with. The film is very slow to get going and there is next to no plot outside of this weird love story. I feel like the entire time you're left thinking ""where is the porn?"" Then it finally comes and you're like ""okay, this is the most interesting part of the entire film."" As always Kate Winslet does not disappoint in showing off some serious skin. unfortunately it felt like the sex scenes were lacking a little passion. It was hard core ""lets get to it"", where was the slow build up? There was none. And above all, the ending? What was that about? Why, just why would you end it like that?

23,tm-sheehan,Slow but builds layer upon beautiful layer 2 great Actresses in their Prime,8,14 January 2021,"My Review - AmmoniteMy Rating 8/10Two enjoyable movies in 2 days on an actual Cinema screen I'm in heaven.
We were the only 2 people in the Cinema ,same yesterday so I don't know what the future for the Cinema is ?
Ammonite certainly won't be a Box Office bonanza film but to me that means nothing the quality is visible only on the screen and every scene in Ammonite is quality.
This is due to the excellent screen writing and direction by Francis Lee and the two remarkable lead actresses Kate Winslet and Saorise Ronan .
The title of the film Ammonite means an ammonoid fossil, especially one of a later type found chiefly in the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, typically with intricately frilled suture lines and this is what the real life Mary Anning spent her life discovering and cataloging.
She was an English fossil collector, dealer, and palaeontologist who became known around the world for finds she made in Jurassic marine fossil beds in the cliffs along the English Channel at Lyme Regis in the county of Dorset in Southwest England .
Set in 1840's England when female friendships were often romanticised, allowing women more freedom to express feelings for each other. However, not all of these relationships went on to develop into homosexual relationships .
There is no doubt in Ammonite that Fossil Scientist Mary Anning (Kate Winslet) and Charlotte Murchison's relationship develops from a reluctant acquaintance to a passionate and consummated sexual relationship.
In fact Kate Winslet said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that she choreographed her sex scenes with Saoirse. Winslet she said. ""I just think Saoirse and I, we just felt really safe. (director) Francis (Lee) was naturally very nervous. And I just said to him, 'Listen, let us work it out.' And we did. I felt the proudest I've ever felt doing a love scene. And I felt by far the least self-conscious.""
Beautifully Filmed on-location in Lyme Regis, a town in West Dorset, England, where the real Mary Anning worked and collected fossils in the early 1800s.
Mary Anning when we first meet her character is living a lonely life with her austere mother Molly played beautifully by the wonderful Gemma Jones. Mary is a scientist not interested in her personal appearance at all her days are spent looking for fossils on the Jurassic Coast.
Charlotte Murchison is left to convalesce by her husband while he trots off on a Scientific expedition. Mary reluctantly is persuaded to take Charlotte in and care for her when she becomes very ill nursing her back to health.
As Charlotte's health improves and her affection for Mary increases the emotional walls tumble down between these 2 lonely women thawing out Mary Anning's austere and protective persona so much so that both these two passionate women's lives are altered forever. Mary responds to Charlottes brighter more extrovert manner and their friendship grows and turns into a deep intimate romance.
I love Francis Lee's films and Television productions that go back to a brilliant Gilbert and Sullivan's biopic ""Topsy Turvey""1999 and a film in 2017 that in my opinion is better than ""Brokeback Mountain "" the superb "" Gods Own Country ."" he wrote and directed this film about a young Yorkshire farmer Johnny Saxby who numbs his daily frustrations with binge drinking and casual sex, until the arrival of a Romanian migrant worker for lambing season ignites an intense relationship that sets Johnny on a new path.
A few cast members of that fine film are in Ammonite Gemma Jones as Molly Anning and Alec Secareanu as Dr Lieberson.
I found the story as it unfolded fascinating and the chemistry and sensitivity between these two great actresses Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan is extraordinary.
If your movie preferences don't stretch to slow paced period piece films that progress the story layer upon layer and stay with you long after the credits, perhaps Ammonite is not for you.",Ammonite
24,Alexander_Blanchett,Beautiful but slow moving,8,5 December 2020,"It was about time to have a collaboration of Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan and the chosen material was ideal for them. Its a very slow moving but very beautifully shot romance between two women who are quite different from each other. The film doesnt care for big locations and portrays the women slowly growing friendship in a very intimate way.
Kate Winslet is fantastic. One of her best performances in years. She really nailed the role and while her performance seemed one noted moody at most of the time, she was able to show so much more that lays beneath that emotion with her performance. Really good. Saoirse Ronan was also good but its not one of her greatest performances and I am afraid this won't bring her another Oscar nomination. The character appeared a bit underwritten at times and incredibly subtle. She was cute and did all her best but was too much in the shadow of Winslet. A noteworthy performance by Gemma Jones, who must have the saddest eyes in the world.
The film has a very gorgeous cinematography and a beautiful score. I also really liked the way director Francis Lee let us witness the blooming love between his two protagonists. A good film, often a bit slow but it takes its time for its characters.",Ammonite
25,sweidman-28016,Not the Most Original But Better Than Expected,8,18 November 2020,"""I don't want to go back to the life I had before you.""In this quiet period piece, acclaimed but overlooked fossil hunter Mary Anning and a young woman sent to convalesce by the sea develop an intense relationship, altering both of their lives forever. The underwhelming TIFF reviews had me worried for this one. And even when the trailer came out I had concerns about how unoriginal the story seemed. However, I am glad to say I found Ammonite quite a good piece in film. If there's one thing that needs to be noted first, it's that this isn't anything amazing, especially on a storytelling perspective. Gay and lesbian movies have become a thing of great example of cinema lately. Portrait of a Lady on Fire proved to be a masterpiece late last year (or early this year depending on where it was released). Ammonite wants to be another Portrait of a Lady on Fire but can't quite reach it. Immediately, it feels that we've seen this movie before. Two woman, one not wanting to be there and the other stubborn, develop a relationship that turns into a great love. The predictability isn't a problem here, though we all know where it will go at key moments. Still, I found myself enjoying Ammonite much more than I expected.I really needed a quiet, romantic drama. They have always been something I've taken a liking to. Chicago is also a loud city. There's noise happening all the time. Just being in the theater with basically no one else watching this, the tranquility just gave me relief. Just quiet. Dialogue is almost absent in the movie. The blocking and developing relationship is where the focus is put on. When dialogue is used, it honestly isn't the strongest ever, but I'm almost glad it didn't go for that. Sometimes the biggest words and metaphors aren't needed to make something great. One random thing because I'm not sure where to mention this, there's a few scenes that incorporate letter writing. In the 1860s writing looked much different and there isn't anyone saying what is written so I'm not quite sure what they said. If the actors maybe read them allowed or something was done about that, it would be favorable to most audiences. Kate Winslet has been getting praised for this role saying it's her best yet. I'm not quite so sure it's her best but I completely understand. She is so damn good. Without the use of words she can convey so much emotion. Winslet immerses herself into the role of Mary and I couldn't picture anyone else in it. The same can be said about Saoirse Ronan. She is one, of not my favorite actress of all time. Her role of Charlotte reminds me of her playing Mary in Mary Queen of Scots. She's very good and has a lot to work with. There's a scene of her going from laughter to a total breakdown that I though was just perfect. A problem with the writing has Charlotte change into something that I didn't quite like in the third act. I'm not sure if it's intentional but it just didn't work for me. Still, she's amazing but I'm not quite sure she'll get nominated with the competition in supporting actress. I might even say the same about Winslet. There's that, the fact that this is a quiet movie, and the mediocre reviews going for it.On all levels other than storytelling, this is beautiful. Starting off with the cinematography. You know that it's going to look great. It takes place by the seaside, archeology has a beautiful nature to it, and it's a period piece. Every shot looks great and I can't see why it won't get nominated. The costumes are fantastic. This will be an example where out of context you could name what movie the costumes are from. The production design is fairly good. Volker Bertelmann and Dustin O'Halloran compose a soothing score. There isn't much score used (only 23 minutes if I remember correctly) but when used it works to it's advantage. Maybe not the nomination type but I still like it. That sort of plays into the sound design which I took a liking to. Again, the use of water elements has much to its advantage. I don't think Ammonite is a disappointment. Maybe I won't like it as much later on but it's still pretty good to me.",Ammonite
26,bangel3322,Well that was quite a waste of time,2,3 February 2021,"I feel this might have worked better as a mini series. There really isn't any character development. Like Mary's character says toward the end of the film to Charlotte, 'You don't know me at all.' The two main characters don't know each other and the audience doesn't know either of them. We needed more of a character build up to understand them and to understand what drew them to one another. Because the chemistry between them onscreen is cold. They did not portray two people in love. So for me this film didn't work at all. It was very slow, underwhelming, monotonous and just not well written. Such a shame cause KW is a fantastic actress and her talent was wasted here.",Ammonite
27,tccandler,Portrait of a Lady on Water...,6,8 December 2020,"Set on the dreary southern coast of Britain in the 1840's, ""Ammonite"" is the story of a lesbian love affair between a repressed fossil hunter and a young wife who is overcoming the loss of a child. The entire film feels like a weaker version of 2019's, ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"". That French movie captured the restrained passion, whereas this effort doesn't let the spark ignite. Still, Winslet and Ronan are superb.",Ammonite
28,Michael Fargo,Why?,8,22 December 2020,"Looking over the actual lives and accomplishments of these two women who are the subject of Francis Lee's ""Ammonite,"" Mary Anning and Charlotte Murchison, it's flabbergasting that you'd concoct a romantic interlude between the two when there is no evidence it happened. Just an outline of the accomplishments of either one of these individuals who were leaders in women stepping outside their rigid domestic roles into the rarefied world of scientific exploration is perverse to imagine full sexual relationship. I realize that a litany of what these two women actually did do would have interfered with the hokum of a love story, but why not just create two fictional women and gone from there? What these women actually did accomplish would far outweigh an imagined closeted same sex coupling.And then there are the sex scenes. No, they aren't explicit but they are lengthy and detailed. So, we're left with the impression of some guy's (the writer/director in this case) need to fantasize about lesbian sex. By all means have at it, but why confuse the history of two famous professional women with your own predilections? Francis Lee, who is gay, has justified his choice by saying ""Why not? There's no evidence Anning had any male companions."" That skips over the question of ""Why?"" If you don't know someone's intimate life, why make it up? If you've got some ax to grind--and gay and lesbian individuals do have that with a wide choice of historical figures who braved society's mores and suffered for it--why make something up? Was he unknowing that this is a trite classic male heterosexual fantasy? Particularly about two people who have other major accomplishments to their name to say nothing of living relatives (some who objected, some didn't). If these women wanted to challenge sexual repression, wouldn't they have done so? They certainly knock down other closed doors.It mars--significantly--a beautiful film with two very talented actresses in some knock-out period costumes who aren't afraid to get them very, very muddy. Has Kate Winslet ever not been terrific? Saoirse Ronin? Her young, very busy career is already approaching Winslet's.The set-up takes a stretch to accept. A husband tired of his melancholic wife, dumps her on Winslet's character's doorstep (a stranger no less), saying ""YOU deal with this. Here's some money for your effort. Bye-bye."" The mores of the time--and certainly Winslet's withdrawn nearly mute character--wouldn't make this a working proposition no matter how much you needed the money. And Ronin's severely stricken character wouldn't--it seems to me--show up every day to wander the beaches collecting ""seashells by the seashore"" no matter how lonely or abandoned you were. She demonstrates her social skills at a party soon after her abandonment. Why keep company with a dour and unpleasant Winslet? But once she does, the movie takes off...or perhaps glides into the sublime.The screenplay is very short on dialogue and what develops is wordless and shows that the cinema is primarily a visual art. And here Francis Lee's talent shines.All of the cast is tremendous, particularly since whatever motivation their characters have is kept from us. A central scene between Winslet and Fiona Shaw, where something happened in the past and we're expecting whatever has been hinted at in the first two-thirds of the film will be explained, well, it's not; and a lot remains a mystery. Even the ever present (and excellent) presence of Gemma Jones as Winslet's Mother never comes into focus. She wanders in; she wanders out. Resentment is heavy in the air, but we never understand why.Yet dreamy, albeit frigid, passages along the shore are wordless as the relationship deepens between Winslet and Ronin's character. Lyme Regis is a far cry from Miami Beach, and the one time the sun seems to shine reflects the warmth of the feelings growing between Winslet and Ronin's characters. Small wordless gestures cue us at what develops between the two.Where it all leads is a final sequence where the two characters wind up in the British Museum where Mary Anning's most famous fossil is on display. That the director chooses to have this magnificent discovery separate the two characters (when in fact historically it brought them together) is a fast way to bring up ""The End"" card and resolve the complicated mess the director created.If you can put aside and learn a little about these two historical figures and know what you're about to see is a fantasy, it's worth seeing for Winslet and Ronin (and the entire cast and production crew's) work, and marvel how little slices of film can convey so much. Just realize it's not about these two actual women; it's a male fantasy.",Ammonite
29,hunter-friesen,Quiet Tale of Passion,8,8 February 2021,"What can be considered dull to some is romantic to others. Set in 1840s England, writer/director Francis Lee tells the story of a forbidden lesbian romance between a lonely fossil hunter and a young woman burdened by a loveless marriage. ""Ammonite"" has all the tropes of the romantic drama genre, but none of its clichés. Lee avoids these traps by trusting his leads in Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan, who are a winning combination as they give amazing performances with little dialogue. Everything comes from just a look or a glance, enough to describe a whole scene and carry a film.",Ammonite

31,Moviegoer19,A Film of Opposites,8,4 January 2021,"I watched Ammonite without once being bored. Interesting, considering how little dialogue there is. I think I was mesmerized by eyes: mostly those of Kate Winslet as Mary Anning, and less so by those of Saoirse Ronan as Charlotte Murchison.Ammonite is a film of the senses. I felt it more than thought it, similar, I suppose, to the character of Anning as she's portrayed here: a woman of few words. In the realm of the senses (!) it's gorgeous and tragic all at once. Many of those beach shots are full of passion while being cold and windy, just as Anning looks plain and unadorned while inside she has much going on.As most of the reviews here have noted, the performances of Winslet and Ronan are exceptional. Winslet especially captures the appearance of someone who is beaten down by life but persists nonetheless, relying on a quiet satisfaction in her work. On the other hand, Ronan is an upper class woman who when we see her at first is despondent over the loss of a baby, which we understand though it's never actually stated. When she falls physically ill, Anning offers TLC, stepping up to do what she feels is right and also most likely because caring for a young woman is out of her daily routine and therefore interesting. Also, we might infer an erotic component, too.The problem with the film for me is that, as someone who has studied script-writing, so much of what happens seems purposeful in terms of furthering the story. E.g., another opposite: while much of what happens feels natural it also feels contrived, such as when the two women go to the music event and Ronan as Murchison sits next to a former friend of Anning, causing Anning to feel disturbed and jealous, thus further implying the ensuing relationship.And then there are the sex scenes. The first, which is not really a sex scene but an implication of one, is when Ronan/Murchison is in bed watching her husband get undressed. Then, there is her husband completely naked, different from most films which generally don't show male genitals. Foreshadowing of things to come? Yes and no.I found the second sex scene with Winslet and Ronan to be gratuitous. Maybe because I'm an ""older"" adult, I prefer to watch intimations of erotic scenes rather than details. But I suppose it could be argued that if this is a film of the senses then a detailed sex scene makes sense.Anyway, the film is interesting, to say the least. I had never heard of ammonite or Mary Anning before this, and certainly as yet another portrayal of the historical oppression of women, this is a different and important addition.",Ammonite
32,Oktay_Tuna,"Everything Similar to ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" Works, While Others Don't",4,7 December 2020,"Piano, beach walks, time period, drawing. These are all in the Portrait of a Lady on Fire as well. I am not saying that the movie ""stole"" these concepts because it didn't. Ammonite is definitely not a remake of Portrait of a Lady on Fire but they tell a different story in a similar way. Ammonite does a great job at what Portrait, already did a great job. It is slow-paced with great cinematography and it has clever usage of silence. I loved all these things but the setup of the story was just mediocre. The introduction of characters are mediocre. I mean the characters can be ordinary but with great direction ordinary can look mesmerizing. The side plots all fell short, the side characters just didn't work unlike Portrait. The acting was very good, deserving of award nominations. The first 90 minutes of the movie was okay, it definitely wasn't bad and had some good elements(even though they were similar to Portrait) but the last 30 minutes... It dragged, It just stopped moving. Almost every choice didn't work out at that point. It was like the director saying, ""Yes, I know you've seen the first 90 minutes before in different movies. Now, I will go for something different, but it won't work."" The ending just didn't work. I was afraid that I wasn't going to like this movie and unfortunately I was right. If the movie just 90 minutes long, then I could have at least said, ""A similar story but not bad at all.""

33,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,"Has all the attributes of a major movie, but isn't",6,3 June 2021,"Considering that the majority of the film takes place in a creaky little house and on the shore of the nearest beach, it's remarkable that it managed to retain my almost unwavering interest for two hours when not that much actually happens, which is much to the credit of the BBC and its first-class acting, excellent production and fantastic sound editing, and if you like austere and serious period dramas with a tasty slice of lesbian trickery then this could be the movie for you.I can only rate this a mediocre 6 though because of how bleak and unexciting it was, even though all the values are potentially in place for a top-class film; the lack of story lets it down and so does the unexplained sexual tension between the ladies - it just wasn't enough - and one minute we're subjected/rewarded to passionate fanny licking, but then they go back into their shells and have none of it, as though mother might be listening, suspecting, prowling around the house or simply watching them snogging on the beach, which also culminated in a spoiled ending that dragged the film down with its unemotional and unrewarding conclusion, as though the scriptwriters had perhaps run out of ideas.The sound editing is superb though, ramped up to the point where you can feel each creaking floorboard and every crashing wave as a spectacle in itself; however, technicalities can't save a movie that has a largely unessential plot and freezing tension, although I can't emphasize enough how Ammonite certainly isn't a dud and is worth watching for so many reasons, but just not enough to recommend.",Ammonite
34,julieshotmail,Kate Winslet carries the film,6,3 April 2021,"""Ammonite"" is interesting from a historical perspective. It's always fascinating to see how life is lived in the 1800s, the expectations on gender roles (you can't pay me to wear a corset and six layers of clothing everyday, that's for sure!), against a beautiful backdrop of muted tones. The contrived lesbian theme is only noteworthy here because it is even bolder of a subject matter to happen in 1840, when it is just something not done in those times, but in doing so, the characters reveal their quiet, rebellious, passionate streak. Saoirse Ronan is a superb actress but she is just average in this movie, not speaking for the first 20 minutes and just getting by on her looks and pensive stares. The queen of stares is really Kate Winslet here.

Gemma Jones is becoming iconic in her roles as matriarchs of the era, and she brought so much subtlety to her role which was far more interesting than a sex act between two women, but the film avoided all 'that' and more, and became narrow and repetitive. Nonetheless, high quality; great costumes, sets, etc. but I thought with 3 or 4 of the world's finest performers that we'd have been treated to a story that -at least- explored the complexities of women in science during the era more thoroughly....or anything relevant...beyond the sexual tension....",Ammonite

The sex scenes are few in number, but shot with delicacy and restraint. In fact, very little of this movie is explicit. An awful lot is left to the imagination of the viewer. Back stories are hinted at, touched briefly upon and only once filled in. Even the ending is left to us to imagine. Implicit, rather than explicit, is the watchword for this movie.

40,JonathanWalford,Too bad about the sex,8,16 February 2021,"This is a great film in many ways - the sets, costumes, acting, writing, cinematography... all excellent. The subtleties of certain scenes, like the mother's fixation over eight Staffordshire figurines that represent the children she lost as infants were touching. The film It could have been a perfect representation of female love and kindred spirits but sex got in the way.This story is based on fact. Mary Anning was a well known amateur paleontologist, however, she was not an Anglican and therefore not eligible for funding (in the days before government taxes for funding education, research grants were provided by Anglican aligned universities.) As a woman her education was hindered but not blocked from earning the respect of accredited scientists in her field. Anning was actually well known in the scientific community during her life, which ended at the age of 47 from breast cancer. She was also remembered after her life and was the subject of an article written by Charles Dickens in 1860.A couple of errors in the film suggest she was not recognized for her contributions such as when her name is replaced on a label in the British Museum. Anning was not in a financial position to donate her findings to the museum, so she sold them to support her work, and the buyer was recognized as the donor to the museum - this is still pretty much how it works today. During her lifetime she had many scientists support her work, who even ensured she had an annual annuity of 25 pounds so that she had some financial security.The true friendship she had with Charlotte took place over the last two decades of Mary's life. They were BFFs and kindred souls but there is no hint to any lesbian activity in the letters they wrote to each other. They may have had desires but it is highly unlikely they were ever acted upon as Mary was devout and 'unnatural affections' were not tolerated by any church, even her Congregationalists who were the most liberal faith going in c. 1840. The attention to the sexual nature of their relationship detracts from the remarkable achievements Mary Anning accomplished, and overpowers the story-telling in the film.I enjoyed the time travel via the attention to details, the character studies, and the subtle back stories, like Charlotte's recent miscarriage as suggested by her mourning attire and melancholia, but I was happy enough that the film didn't need any more, especially as its not a unique theme, nor probably faithful to the real people whose story this is.",Ammonite

Rather than two husbands to hide their romance from here the antagonists are a mother and an utterly disinterested husband.Winslet's Mary is based on a real life character who's work as a paleontologist living on the Dorset Coast was so important that the poor men of high society had no option but to take the credit. So, a fascinating woman.Into her life of making ends meet by selling her finds in a small shop run by her mother, we get Ronan's Charlotte, a geology enthusiast, left to Mary's care by a husband wealthy enough to unburden himself of a sombre wife while he gallivants about Europe. Mary is poor enough that she is obliged to accept the duty of care.What follows is a fictionalised romance between two people who existed and knew each other, but for which there is no evidence of such a relationship - the director's claim that there was no evidence that there wasn't a relationship comes across as weak, the kind of logic any conspiracy troll would be familiar with. Unfortunately that isn't the only flaw.There are undeniably beautiful landscapes to look at and an interesting story to tell about a fascinating woman's life, but the whole endeavour feels so much like a stage play, one suffocated by dour demeanours and limited imagination.Where both The World To Come and Ammonite fail is where Portrait Of A Lady On Fire shines, there is enough passion and romance in the latter for all three.",Ammonite

46,Bek204,A great love story that's missing many elements,6,14 December 2020,"Ammonite's love/dramatic story is very deep and beautiful. But, the film was really missing many things that prevented it from being a great motion picture.The film's love story is very unique and beautiful. Really loved the love story between the two characters and how it was built. But, it was built in a way that was so dull, slow, and boring. It didn't take a long time to build it, it was being built in a dull/slow way that made it seem like it was long. I have watched many films that are like Ammonite, films that are slow and cold but some were actually very great because they used many aspects to make it be so.To have both Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan in one film is a very big thing, both of them put a great performance that is worth an Oscar nomination especially Kate Winslet. She was able to portrait her boring/depressed character very well, her face was saying it all, by looking at her face you can tell what she's feeling. But, I feel like the writers didn't use them well, in some scenes, I felt like they were only focusing on both of them too much and ignoring other things like music, set design, and screenplay. What's the point of focussing on the acting and ignoring everything else?. Having both of them in one movie is a very big chance that nobody should waste and they should use it very well and be careful with it especially that the bond between them was so great.In addition, The film has a very beautiful/genuine loud silence. Silence is a very important thing in this film and it has so many meanings behind it. Silence is a language, silence speaks volumes. But, I feel like the reason why the film seems dull and slow is because of this, ""THE SILENCE"". It was used too much and in a way that would make it seem like it's a boring film. If it was used very well, then this film would've been a masterpiece for sure. There are many scenes or films that have complete silence In them. But the audience still enjoys seeing them. For Instance, ""Call Me By Your Name"" has many scenes in it that are completely silent. Like, one character is just eating or smoking or watching anything without saying a word. But with all of that ""Call Me By Your Name"" is one of the best films ever and the reason why is because the film used many aspects and knew how to use ""silence"" in a way that would make it seem great.The sound mixing & sound editing were awful. In some scenes, I was struggling to understand the speech and the background noises were louder than the speech. The film is also missing a music score that would've made many scenes better.The film has visually stunning frames and shots, the cinematography was great. But, they were so few.In the end, Ammonite would've been a masterpiece especially that it has a great love story that would live for ages and two amazing actresses. But, the film didn't use the tools that they have in a way that would make the film a masterpiece.My rating is: 6.5/10",Ammonite
47,JBLOSS,Missed opportunity,4,20 June 2021,"I had high hopes for Ammonite, a great cast and the beautiful Dorset coast suggested good things. However, this film moved glacially and completely sidelined the work of Mary Anning. Taking real life characters and concocting a lesbian love affair at the expense of reality just feels a wasted opportunity. At times the situations felt laughably contrived and didn't feel in any way an accurate representation of Victorian England. Somehow even the beautiful coastline didn't manage to shine, what a shame.",Ammonite
48,yespat,The Ending?!,6,27 March 2021,"I wish someone could explain the ending to me. Mary's outrage and coldness seemed to come from out of the blue. And at the very end, it was left with no resolution.And i agree there was not much happening between the two until Ronan kissed her. That was unexpected as well. My only explanation for that was that Ronan's character's husband was so dismissive of his wife that anything would have been preferable, even stone faced Mary.Mary's relationship with her mother was nonexistent. They lived in such close proximity it did not make sense that they had no connection.I enjoyed the film nonetheless but the ending did put me off. I would have liked it a lot more, even with the aforementioned shortcomings, had they explored the ending in more detail.",Ammonite

Whilst Technically this film is superb - it gets the period detail and atmosphere just right, Kate Winslett is great as Anning and the cast otherwise are excellent, sadly Anning's real story is hardly developed, and instead we get a lesbian love story - for which there's no evidence , and which looks both out of place and unrealistic in the context of mid 19c England. A missed opportunity.",Ammonite
50,Aria_Athena,Falls short and it is a shame,5,30 June 2021,"Pretty hard not to compare it with 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire', which is a similar, but much better film. It lacked the superb cinematography, the great character writing and, most important of all, the chemistry between the leading actresses.Not all is bad though, far from it. The cinematography may not be superb, but it's still very good. Winslet was excellent, Ronan not that much to be honest, although I mostly blame the script for that. There were a few very nice shots, like the very last one, and there was some efficient and subtle storytelling through visuals.Now with the negatives. Number one problem for me, close to zero chemistry between the main characters. But the romance has to progress, so we introduce number two problem, bad and very forced dialog, most of it coming from Ronan. ""You look tired, we can share a bed"" or ""I thought you were the most fascinating person tonight, also the most beautiful"" while for the whole evening Winslet said nothing to her, stood in in a corner looking miserable and left early because she was jealous. I wish the dialog was half as good as the visuals.I didn't have problem just with the dialog, but with the overall writing. Barely any character development, especially for Winslet's character. The best supporting character told her at some point that Ronan managed to awaken something inside her. If you say so, who am I to argue with the script.My last complaint come about after the movie finished and I started thinking more about it. A lot of the visual and subtle storytelling I talked about, and I do mean a lot, at least the better part of the first 40 minutes and the last 10, is used to show us the inequality between men and women in science during that period. The thing is, although the chracters and events are based on real people, as far as this movie is concerned, Winslet being a palaeontologist / geologist is just circumstantial. It's not important to the story that she was a scientist.So the best parts of the movie, like the visuals, are focused on background elements that are not properly developed, while the worst parts like the dialog are focused on the meat of the story, which is the romance.Nevertheless, I will be checking out this director's / writer's other movie.",Ammonite

But the truth is that above all I enjoy it, there is a certain level of elegance in many moments of the direction and I think that I am influenced by the fact that I have listened to the music almost daily since it was selected in the Oscar's shortlist for the best original score.

52,willcrabbe,A Lesser Portrait of a Lady on Fire,6,11 July 2021,"Francis Lee's newest film Ammonite explores the relationship that develops between palaeontologist Mary Anning (Kate Winslet) and Charlotte Murchison (Saoirse Ronan) when they spend 6 weeks together on the beaches of Lyme Regis.I couldn't help comparing this film to Lee's previous work God's Own Country as a lot of the plot beats and execution seemed very noticeably similar. There's also quite a few nods to Céline Sciamma's wonderful romantic drama Portrait of a Lady on Fire scattered throughout. Herein lies a problem. I never felt the same chemistry between Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan in Ammonite as I did between Noémie Merlant and Adèle Haenel in Portrait (except for maybe one scene). Not to detract from the performances of the leads here - Winslet was great and Ronan probably played the boldest role of her career thus far - but chemistry is a huge part of a film like this.The colour palette of the film is also very grey and muted, perfectly reflecting the drab majesty of the English coast. Likely this was intentional, but it seemed to contrast with the fiery passion that rears its head throughout (again comparing to the vibrant colours of Portrait of a Lady on Fire). The production and costume design were both excellent and was probably the strongest aspect of the film.The historical accuracy of the film has come under scrutiny from critics, as while Mary Anning and Charlotte Murchison did indeed meet and become close friends, there is no evidence that the two ever shared a romantic relationship. You could view this as a hypothetical scenario, given that in the 19th century, women were hardly free to pursue and openly express same-sex romantic relationships. The film therefore serves as more than a historical drama, but as a tribute to the potential untold stories of forbidden love throughout history.To summarise, Ammonite is a slow and quiet love story with explosions of passion, but ultimately it feels like a muted version of Portrait of a Lady on Fire.",Ammonite
53,suuronenmiro,Much better on second watching,8,7 July 2021,"Now i noticed some smaller things abd symbolism in it.Good performance from Kate Winslet.And Saoirse Ronan did well too.Her role was more silent and subtle.I noticed how her sickness is major plot point in this movie.When she gradually gets better mentally as well physically, relationships get deeper too.Not pefect movie but i somewhat like it.",Ammonite
54,karlmartin-47352,A beautiful silence...,7,18 October 2020,"I'm rating this the same as I did The Portrait of a Lady, as they both have extreme similarities to one another. Not to take anything away from either, but with this especially, I've never known a quieter film. Not in terms of the volume but there is a real contrast to the sound of the violence of the crashing waves and the feeling of being out of control, to the then relative peace of a warmer day whilst the characters establish their relationships with one another. There are also segments of isolation & at times the silence is deafening & the camera cuts quite often to scenes of live animals crawling over paintings of nature, which I interpreted as though the two worlds look like they are in sync, but very definitely not in equal measure.",Ammonite
55,JICNZ,What A Shame,1,30 June 2021,"I had not heard of Mary Anning, and knew nothing of her life or achievements. I don't know much more now. I do however know more about lustful looks to other women and lesbian sex. In fact, I know far more than anyone could possibly want to know about that. But not scientific achievement or fossils, or women in the Victorian age. Do be warned if you are thinking of watching this film. 1. Fossils and science are not really featured at all. 2. There are some prolonged and absolutely excruciatingly embarrassing to watch sex scenes--pornographic levels of detail. 3. Everything is dour: dirty hair; filthy, broken nails; rancid food. 4. There is very little dialogue: you have to guess what is happening most of the time as you aren't told. 5. Mary is portrayed as the most unpleasant, miserable, sour, unhappy, repressed, beaten down woman you could hope never to meet. Hardly enjoyable viewing.

Disappointingly, we get very little Mary Anning in this film. Her fight to be recognised as a scientist in her own right despite misogynist opposition would make a good story.Instead, the whole film was a lesbian love-story - ground that was covered recently (and far better) in Portrait of a Lady on Fire.

What is sad is, aside the developing love story with Charlotte Murchison, you don't get the same understanding for Elizabeth Philpott and the strained relationship with her mother, what was the connection . The opportunity to understand what Mary Anning had gone through the fact that she was not recognised for all her findings till after her death although there are articles by Henry De La Beche (president of the geological society) and Charles Dickens bestowing that her contributions to understanding of fossils and science are the most important findings of the 20th Century. An opportunity missed to show much more of her life and one of which Kate Winslett would have done further more justice. Had the BBC concentrated on that little bit more and why she was excluded from the geologist society then this woudl have been a 10/10.",Ammonite

Having a pop at yesterday's moral's and how they still impinge on us today is something that could have been done without hijacking a real person. A real person who deserves her story telling properly. Even the BBC article I read said this film wasn't a gender issue film, it was a class issue film, with many men and women suffering what she suffered. If anything gender was a side issue. The gender issue would have been an issue within it's own class, not across classes. But they want to lose that because it doesn't fit the modern tick box exercise and all us working class thickies wouldn't be capable of putting two things together. In fact the same insult is levelled at us still!Maybe I'm being a little harsh. That said, I really enjoyed it as a film. The pace reflected the situation, the acting was brilliant, Kate Winslet expression was a brick wall, but when she eventually succumbed to smile it was beautiful. The story was gorgeous.My criticism lies with the writer/director for picking Mary Anning name to write fiction against. If you are writing a film about her, actually focus on her life, yes you can embellish, but embellish the truth, not that it would need that.",Ammonite

60,samuellickiss,Beautiful film; rubbish history and saps the real emotional weight out of Anning's life,3,1 April 2021,"The Geological Society of London celebrated it's 100th anniversary of admitting women as Fellows, an honour Mary Anning sadly never received despite the respect she commanded among her male contemporaries as a skilled scientist. She was financially supported through her illness by the Society's Fellows and upon her death with a stained glass window in the church at Lyme Regis and a eulogy written by the Society's then-President, Henry de la Beche that provides no illusions that she was well-liked and respected.Of course, the film doesn't take this angle, instead preferring to falsely portray her as someone who was not taken seriously as a palaeontologist by not being given credit for her discoveries (she was).A Victorian lesbian love story could be good, but this is a fictionalised one based upon a real woman whose love life we have virtually no information on. It is taking such strong liberties with it and that sits uncomfortably with me. It's not an especially interesting story, one which has been done time and time again in other films. I'm not sure what the purpose it is. Gay relationships were frowned upon in Victorian times? It's not really news. It's not adding anything of substance or any new angles.The way Anning overcame class struggle and the expectations of women at the time to become a success is an incredible story, especially as contemporary geoscience is still a largely male science (though it's changing at a glacial rate). There aren't many biopics about scientists full stop (sadly), male or female. One about a Victorian working-class woman is just perfect material for a biopic, and unfortunately this just isn't it.I was very excited about this film and I followed its development for years. However, I wanted a film that I, as a geoscience professional who frequently goes into schools, could show to my young niece and students as an inspiration for them to pursue careers in science. With the focus on adult themes, this clearly isn't going to be the case.Alan Turing got to be gay (with all the weight that came with that in his tragic story), but he also got to be cool and interesting in The Imitation Game. Mary Anning just doesn't get to be much at all. I guess I'll have to wait until someone makes a film about Marie Curie.Technically, the film is perfect. It is beautifully shot, quietly introspective and slow-paced. I like that sort of thing. Others will not; that's a matter of taste.Bottom line, if you want a beautifully filmed, well-acted, lesbian drama then this is a good choice. If you want a film about an inspirational scientist then, well, you won't.",Ammonite

65,sigelm,Beautifully done but historically inaccurate,9,9 December 2020,"I love the subtlety and the emotion of it. Would have preferred a less explicit last lovemaking scene, but with more feelings. Yet it works this way as well.
I have only two issues with this film: First the ending. It would be really generous to call it an open ending. It's a pure unclear ending, with no hint of what might follow. It's like a knife cut within the storyline and the rest of the tale just fell off the cliff into the ambiss.
Second issue: Historical inaccuracy of their relationship. Set 20 years later than the characters met in the real life, one of them being 30 years younger than the historical figure she represents, plus the deliberate misinterpretation of their friendship as a romantic relationship while it clearly wasn't. As a lesbian, I find it offensive for straight historical figures. I wouldn't want that one day someone digs up my life and invents a story about a supposed romance, nonetheless adultery, between me and some of my male friends. It's not respectful, it's not historically accurate and it's not true to the character. Why not rather invent a fictional story instead? Why using real persons' names? And if possible, without cheating for once.
On the artistic side, it's wonderful, minus the ending. Definitely worth watching several times throughout years to come.",Ammonite

There were lots of little bits that gave us the whole pic without shoving it down our throats.

68,earthboli,Portrait of Silence and More Silence,4,8 December 2020,"The best way to describe this film is if Portrait of A Lady on Fire was written by a man. Meaning, there seems to be a lack of understanding of what builds intimacy and connection between women in this film, so it seems like a bit of a failed attempt to replicate the former film, just in the 1840s with a self-made fossil expert rather than a painter.One character (Mary, played by Winslet) is cold and guarded, and we never really see her come out of her shell. Like ever. The other, Charlotte, played by Ronan) is practically throwing herself at Mary. But we never really understand why she's so hot and bothered, because Mary doesn't ever talk. The little things, like playfulness, eye gazes, and deep conversation that build intimacy are missing. All we get are a few ankle shots and googly eyes from Ronan. Even the love scenes felt transactional and sort of out of nowhere.The plot and premise are certainly worthwhile, but the script and direction fell really short, which created a lack of chemistry. I enjoy subtlety, but this was just confusing and unfortunately, really boring. Ultimately, Mary's character in particular is a frigid icicle who never fully thaws enough for us to sympathize with her. It's also just hard to root for a couple when we don't even understand why they like each other in the first place. Other films have created intimacy/tension far more masterfully.This was disappointing, and suffers from a lack of character development, pacing, and script issues. Winslet and Ronan do their best with what they have, but like Disobedience, there isn't enough for us to digest.",Ammonite

To some degree the other actors don't really get a look in, even Fiona Shaw, but I think the director was going for the intensity of the relationship between the two main characters.

83,GlarkCable,Non-verbal communication is key,8,3 December 2020,"This movie isn't for everyone, that much is clear from the mixed reviews. Some people enjoy it, others think it's an absolute bore. I fall into the first category. The movie isn't flawless but I found myself involved and captivated throughout. Personally, for me it was never too slow, but I can understand that people might feel differently. You should prepare yourself for a slow-paced, two hour long dramatic period piece.The acting from everyone in the film is fantastic but of course in particular from the two leading ladies. Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan are absolutely terrific. The chemistry between them felt genuine and well-done to me, which is crucial in a romantic movie.Only two very skilled actors could pull off the type of non-verbal communication that is often present in this move. It's nice that they don't have to share their life stories to each other in front of the camera. Their connection is deeper than basic communication. So much can be said with a glance, smile, and subtle body language. It's refreshing and surprisingly intense. Actions speak louder than words, after all.The soundtrack is lovely and subtle, but gets intense at the exact right moments.The cinematography fits the film perfectly.Finally, I was intrigued by the unique concept of the movie. Ammonites, a love story between two women from very different backgrounds, the struggles of a lower class woman living with her terminally ill mother, the inequality between men and women during that time... and all of that (loosely) based on the life of a real person. Multiple interesting concepts coming together in one movie.If you're hoping for a queer love story between two women that is happy and not a little depressing, you might want to adjust your expectations. This movie can be a bit dreary and sad. I have to admit I'm a bit tired of all the gloomy, unhappy WLW movies that exist, and still longing for a relatively happy queer movie, like a 'Love Simon' for women.All in all, however, I did enjoy it and would probably watch it again in a few years.",Ammonite
84,bondscammer,An Interesting Failure,6,9 January 2021,"Ammonite is the story of two woman, in total opposite lifestyles, find the passion missing in their lives is brought out by each other.An period piece filmed in Dorset, England, with apparently awful and noisy beaches.The two stars, Saoirse Ronan (my fav actress) and Kate Winslet, give strong, mannered performances though the film plays like a Masterpiece Theatre episode. I feel a touch of humour here and there would alleviate the grim mood at times.In fact, the overheated sex scenes are the only life shown in the film, though both actors are believable.The metaphor of the ammonite stone as a healing to personal awakening is soon apparent by a couple of raw and sensual scenes, that bring their repressed passion for another to a boil.Sadly, it's not enough to save this film from collapsing under the weight of its own pretentiousness. Some humour would been appreciated and there was no need to use a real life person's identity without providing any personal history or details of these folks at all.A game effort of the cast to keep the film interesting and engaging just falls short of that. It's worth seeing for the performances but don't watch in a sleepy mood!",Ammonite

Plot without any freshness, at times I had the impression that I did not know what I was watching it for. The film could be shortened by half an hour and maybe it would keep people from falling asleep at the screening. Ammonite was killed primarily by a very poor selection of actresses. The roles of lesbians should be played by real life lesbians because only lesbians can transfer to the screen what they feel and what they struggle with. Saoirse and Kate are great actresses, but they have failed at all in these roles. The biggest problem is that all of these movies are directed by men, not gay women. This is why Ammonite suffers from the same problems that plague other similar lesbian movies. Lack of understanding of two loving women. I thought the Ammonite movie would be innovative, bold, but it ended up with another average and prude experience",Ammonite

92,chrisarciszewska,A load of lesbian twaddle and a severe case of misogyny,6,29 March 2021,"I put this film in the genre of Lesbian Twaddle - I can say that as I am one. I'm not sure who these films are aimed at, but that is beside the point. My main problem with this film is the misogyny and it is a big problem. Very rarely does a film make me cross, but this one did. It also makes me cross that I have only found one review that picks up on this issue. It's on a website called Paste if anyone wants to look it up. Many people question, why make up a lesbian romance for Mary Anning when there is no evidence for one, but no-one questions the misogynistic approach. I personally don't have a problem with the lesbian bit -we have been written out of history.The initial premise of the film and main focus of the first half hour or so, it to highlight the misogyny of the scientific establishment at the time and Mr Murchison's treatment of his wife. The ultimate irony is that, Francis Lee by his portrayal of Charlotte Murchison and Elizabeth Philpot (Fiona Shaw), does both these women a great dis-service. Charlotte is portrayed as vapid and Elizabeth as some old hippy type making herbal remedies, when they were both accomplished scientists in their own right and had interesting lives. The film is misogynistic because it gives less attribution to their paleontology achievements than did the male-dominated natural history circles at the time!Unless Francis Lee simply wants to maintain his position as prime director of LGBT films (I thought God's Own Country was excellent), I don't know why he felt the need, when Mary Anning had a very eventful life which would have made a much better film, to create a mythical lesbian romance. He would have done just as well to base a film on her brother Joseph. Rich man from London turns up in Lyme Regis with his errant son, leaves him with Joseph because he thinks a bit of sea air and hard work in the upholstery trade will turn his life around. A bit of drudgery with horsehair and cotton wadding, then sex on a pebbly beach - job done!I gave the film six stars because it was well acted and the cinematography and costumes were excellent. However two last points that I think were huge gaffs. No-one in 1840 and who kept their own chickens would cook an addled egg or one with a chick in (it happened so fast I couldn't quite see) as eggs would be collected every day and you know if a hen has gone broody is sitting on eggs. Gone off eggs float when put in a bowl of water. Also I'm sure men did not tie their scarves in a Hoxton knot in 19th Century England - maybe on the continent but not here!",Ammonite
93,Niklas_M,A true person depicted on a giant lie,1,24 May 2021,"Mary Anning was not a lesbian, so why make her one? If you want to make a historic film about a remarkable woman but ignore the facts of her life; that she grew up poor, and that she taught herself to read and went on to become a female pioneer in paleontology I am all with you. But would you accept a lie of this kind today, if it had been the other way around?

95,Flintenweibe,"An insult to paleontologists, geologists, historians, lesbians and women in general",1,16 June 2021,"Director and producer of this travesty, Francis Lee, apparently said that with this film he wanted to give Mary Anning ""the relationship she deserved"", to which I say; What did the poor woman ever do to you?If anyone don't understand why this is a massive insult to Mary Anning and Charlotte Murchison, just imagine a film made about any famous historical man portrayed in this way. It'd be ridiculous to take say, George Cuvier or Charles Darwin and completely eject all their scientific endeavors from a film about them in favor of injecting a fictional and unrealistic gay love story into their lives, complete with an explicit sex scene that looks more like the work of a sweaty teenage boy than a respected filmmaker. The very notion would be deemed absurd if it was a male scientist, but with women it's apparently OK.The real Mary Anning was a huge pioneer within paleontology, made even more remarkable by the fact that she was both a woman, and working class in a time where nearly all other scientists and their institutions were exclusive to men from the upper class. But the film doesn't really showcase any of it, all her amazing scientific work is shoved to the far background whilst the writer/director seems far more interested in speculating what Mary Anning's sex life was like.Now, Francis Lee is a gay man himself, and I liked his previous film, God's own Country, which I thought handled the trials of gay men in a small town excellent, but what Francis Lee seems to have failed to realize is that in using famous historical women to tell a gender-swapped version of God's own country, instead of a progressive gay drama he plays into massively sexist notions that women's professional work doesn't matter and the most interesting about them is their sexual and romantic relationships, and the idea that women can't have platonic relationships worth telling stories about, they need to be sexual.Not only does the film greatly reduce the work of Mary Anning, but Charlotte Murchison, in the film portrayed as a just a bored housewife that needs to have her depression cured by romance, was a competent geologist in her own right, but this is COMPLETELY ignored in this film. Also ignored was the fact that people couldn't just have casual lesbian relationships and kiss openly without fear of consequences in 1800s England, and treating it as such does all real lesbians who had to stay in the closet or be forced into loveless marriages for the sake of appearances a great disservice.And it's not even a good romance between them, both main actresses look bored throughout and I literally saw more chemistry between the protagonist and a fossilized ichtyosaur than with her co-actor.If you want a good lesbian historical drama, just watch Gentleman Jack instead, if you just want to see Kate Winslet topless, just watch Titanic instead,
and if you want a good film about paleontologist Mary Anning... well, I can't think of a good film about that, but you certainly won't find it in Ammonite.",Ammonite

I was hoping to see something similar to the movie Blue is The Warmest Color. Ammonite is by no means an equally good lesbian movie. Something that stands out most about this movie is the lack of chemistry between the main characters. I don't feel this infatuation, this love, this lust. The plot is also not very engaging, it is stretched out. The film is very prudish in expression. I'm surprised because the previous film by this director was really bold. There are no bold sex scenes in Ammonite. The only bold nudity in the movie doesn't even come from women. This prudishness shouldn't happen in an LGBT movie. I rate the movie 4/10.

The few scenes of sexual intercourse are very unrealistic and prudish. This film is the biggest disappointment of lesbian cinema in recent years. Why are lesbian movies made by male directors and not by lesbians? Why aren't real lesbians but straight women playing the role of lesbians? Why are male characters and straight plots constantly interjected in lesbian movies? Why are male characters needed in lesbian movies?

108,mailcarl,Nice film. Worth the watch.,7,30 October 2021,I will confess that I didn't know the story of Mary Anning. I decided to give this film a try because I'm a fan of Kate Winslet and because of the lesbian relationship between the two main characters. With a 15 rating the film is not overly explicit but was more so than I expected. But being less explicit does not take away from the power or eroticism of their relationship. The age difference between the characters and their different backgrounds make the story more enticing. It is quite a long period film but I think the story is well told and developed. I personally would recommend.,Ammonite

112,bernardaquina,Will awaken and titckle your fancy,8,10 November 2021,"Writer/Director Francis Lee of God's Own Country and The Farmer's Wife, directs Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan in this quaint portrayal of awakening desires between two mis mismatched sirens. In Ammonite, Kate Winslet is memorable as the stoic, closed off middle aged spinster. Kate, best known for her role as Rose in the romantic, adventurous, money maker, The Titanic, and Saorise Ronan, known for her role as the pre adolescent, assassin-in-training in Hannah and the fetching immigrant in Brooklyn, hold your attention through out. Ammonite is set in Victorian era England, a drab, depressing sea coast town where the persistence of Kate, who, at a young age discovered an archeological fossil of note, is a middle-age emotionally shut down spinster reduced to a daily existence of searching for new discoveries, scavenging the local beach beach. She struggles to feed herself and her mother, played by Gemma Jones of Sense and Sensibility and You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, having accepted her place in a male dominated world where the academic and societal aspirations of women is repressed. Until, one day she receives a visit by a wealthy young nobleman with his beautiful but sickly wife in tow, played by Saorise. He convinces Kate to tutor him in her craft. Reluctantly she accepts his offer that soon turns into a request to take on his wife as an apprentice also. In spite of herself, her attraction for Saorise awakens her sublimated desires when she becomes the care giver of the young wife after her husband leaves her in Kates' care. But the convalescing young wife recovers and, well, that's about as much as I should reveal, but I recommend a patient sit-through of this sensitively directed tender love story. It artfully unfolds to tickle the heart strings and other parts with scenes of passionate sexual reveals. Spoiler alert, the especially well played last scene in the British Museum brings this film to a heart warming ending. Overall a solid 8.",Ammonite
113,alvesaricia,"In trying to be to deep, ended up being shallow",4,8 December 2020,"Many things about this film disappointed me. I'll start by saying that many comments I saw here seem to think that people who didn't like it simply didn't get all the silences and the nuances of the film. That's rather pretentious, really. I entered this experience expecting nuance and complexity, for all of what the story promised beforehand - women, science, homossexuality, all of which in small english town in the 1800s. Still, I was left disappointed. I can't shake off the feeling that in trying to give the characters depth, the script invested so much in their sadness and melancholy that it felt to me just like another form of being unidimensional. You see, if you explore only how dull, emotionless and taciturn a person is, they become this one thing only. It's bizarre how the film only allows them to display emotions after they have fallen in love and started their relationship. You could argue that that was the point - how they saved each other from the loneliness that they both had to put up with. But I insist that it wasn't a good depiction of that either. For you to get involved with someone you can't be the walking corpse of a human being to begin with. Where does love even blossom when you find life so unbearable as they seem to do?And here I enter my main critique: the film focus so much on showing the contrast of how miserable they are before each other and how their relationship saved them that I believe they had to pretty much bury Mary Anning's story. Now, I know that there's a ""Green Book""-like controversy about this film, and that her family has complained that there's no evidence that she was gay, etc. But you see, after watching the film, I don't think we even need to go there. It just pays no tribute to her loving of science. It shows us some scattered scenes of her cleaning fossils, examining them, but it doesn't explain her main discoveries, the impact that they had in the field, why are they special at all. It also throws at us something about the sexism of the age, the suppresssing of her name, but that's just so badly explored. It's like the writers sat together and said ""I mean, let's just mention it, it couldn't hurt"". Finally, what brakes my heart the most is that this woman was really unique. Can you imagine that she would actually wake up before dawn, in a cold place, to go to a seafront and explore ammonites? She wasn't even recognised for it, she was just that passionate. Yet, the film shows every scene of her being utterly miserable All.The.Time. I do not imagine that she would be prancing and singing, but I can't understand why wouldn't they include a scene of her having the time of her life alone at the beach, smiling after finding something remarkable. That would make for such a great psichological study! A single woman in those days, never married, no children, who loves to go discover ancient rocks, by her own, at the seashore. Honestly, that's what this should have been. Instead, all the scenes of her life and interests seem to be just filling space.I could go on. Side characters are very shallow. The illness of the mother is never explained further and her entire persona is only shown if she's interfering with her daughter and the couple. The scene when she dies is so emotionless and makes so little difference to the movie that she might as well have been dead from the start. The men who come into the shop for Mary Anning's findings are non descriptive and generic, including the husband of her lover, whose interest for Mary Anning's work serves just as plot point for the two women to get acquainted. He's so interested one day, the next he's like ""Yeah, can you take care of my wife? see ya"". And there's also the whole health condition of this one. It's explained that she's depressed, but then out of the blue she gets in such a bad physical state that a doctor gets worried that she might die. But where did all that come from? What happened? And how come it came and went without any further explanation?Because Kate Winslet is in the movie I couldn't help but remember Titanic as I watched it. That was a real story with a fictional romance on top of it, but James Cameron made sure to be so thorough about the real disaster that I actually remember the date that the ship sank. It's a historical tragedy that most people only know because a film depicted it with care and respect. It's a completely different story but I do think that there was something to learn there: if you're making up a love story on top of real people's lives, at least be truthful to them.",Ammonite

It was a film starring incredibly talented actresses, directed by the amazing yet criminally underrated Francis Lee. If you are unfamiliar with Francis Lee he also directed the spectacular 2017 film, Gods Own Country... So obviously the expectations were high but somehow it more than lived up to them. I am a massive fan of Saoirse Ronan, I adore her as an actress and a human being. I also love Kate Winslet, in fact, I have since I was a child as I was obsessed with the film Titanic. Kate was one of my first celebrity crushes and Saoirse is my current celebrity crush so the both of them together in a film playing lovers... I was IN.I'm a writer yet I am unable to properly articulate how I feel towards this film. I am near speechless.It is also incredibly tough for me to keep this review spoiler-free because I want to go on and on about how this film set in the 1800s somehow struck such a familiar cord and made me feel for and relate to the characters...I also need to mention how visually stunning this film is...Every scene was beautiful and an absolute treat for the eyes. It gave off a somewhat calming yet emotional vibe. Every single shot of the film was precise and aesthetically pleasing.The writing and direction of this film was absolute perfection, kudos to Francis Lee.The costumes, makeup, hair, and set design were also complete and utter perfection.The score, so beautiful...The whole film, just sublime.I can't express my love for this film enough. I don't know how to give it justice.This film made me cry, laugh, and fall in love with Kate and Saoirse all over again as Mary Anning and Charlotte Murchison. Kate as Mary was breathtaking and phenomenal, It was different from anything I had seen her do before, she was magnificent. I didn't feel like I was watching Kate Winslet, I saw her as her character and only her character. She helped me throw myself completely into the film because her acting was so precise and just stunning. She never ceases to amaze me. Saoirse as Charlotte was charming, awe-inspiring, and lovely.This film is alluring and prepossessing.It was impeccable.Kate Winslet, take a bow.Saoirse Ronan, take a bow.Francis Lee, take a bow.To everyone involved in this film, thank you.This is cinema at its finest.I can feel this film tightening its grip on me and I am already craving experiencing it again. In fact, I am already planning to see it again in a few days.I just know this is going to be a film I rewatch over and over again.The poster is going on my wall, that alone explains how I feel about this film...

Fragility and courage create the foundation for an intense and secret bond between the two women, who communicate purely through glances and few words. Their relationship improves and changes, as does their spirit and vision of what they really want from life.

There are some elements in this movie which help to cover the weakness of the screenplay , the most important of them is the actings of Kate Winslet and Sairose Ronan , the other interesting element which is my favorite one in this film is its atmosphere and setting which quickly absorb the audience , costume design of this movie as I mentioned before is very good , but the purpose of the movie is not really specified and Screen play is such a weak one.

The recognition she truly deserves is squandered by a totally unsubstantiated lesbian relationship, leaving a greatly inspiring career and her many achievements hardly touched on or explored.I live a few miles from Lyme and was so looking forward to watching this film and learning more about one of our local heroines.Like me; I suspect many of us round her are pretty annoyed and disenchanted by this parody of truth and as a progression of Gay Rights, this is a spectacular example of blowing UP the bridge of the necessary respect and understanding you truly deserve.Most people nowadays are totally sick of having certain agendas pushed down their throats and this is a typical example of the crazy crazy world people are generally forced into pretending is okay.Of course the film had some beautiful film making and acting in it.

They remind the old me with my ex (who was an ENFP person and already passed because of cancer).What Kate and Saoirse did was too real. Our relationship was so tough and intense like that. Every time she tried to get another step of relationship, I preferred saying no and keeping pushing away. The most of my responses was silence and no's (I swear I didn't know why I acted so terribly while she always had given me very good things), but yeah, I know now.

138,evelynsdaughter,Deviates too far from the history and who Charlotte Murchison was as a scientist in her own right,5,12 April 2021,"There are two scientific women in the 19th century who form a long friendship through their common interest in Geology and Palaeontology. One spends her life collecting fossil specimens in Lyme Regis and the other spends her life travelling with her husband to collect specimens and working with him in scientific pursuits - she was the original scientist between them and is instrumental in sparking scientific interest in him (and supporting his work) which ultimately leads to his knighthood in recognition of his scientific achievements.What is exceptional about these women is that they both did serious scientific work at a time when it was considered an entirely male preserve, and that they faced lack of access to scientific forums and lack of credit for their achievements. This at a time when scientific discovery and engineering advancement was mushrooming to create huge excitement and transform thinking and attitudes in intellectual circles and wider society - to an extent that is hard to imagine today. What a pleasure it must have been for the two women to have been able to talk to each other and exchange ideas in this context.Could Francis Lee get his head around this situation to make a great film out of it? Apparently NOT! That would have been too weird/difficult/boring??Instead he chose to take the scientist completely out of one of the women to make her into something of a bored housewife type of character and then fabricate a lesbian relationship between them (incidentally cuckolding the husband, Sir Roderick Murchison, in the process and riding roughshod over the historical record of what seems to have been a long and happy marriage and professional partnership.)Yes, make a film about a lesbian relationship in Victorian England, but do it with fictional characters, or characters where there is at least some basis for considering the relationship to have been lesbian. Or, if you're determined to ladle a speculative lesbian fiction onto the story of two real women, please don't completely deny the one's professional scientific character and capabilities in the process - or deny the mutual scientific interest that brought them together (in their own right, not via a bumptious husband as in the film.)What is most upsetting about this film is the lost opportunity to explore something really interesting - the context for women in science at that exciting time and the possibility that, guess what, women can have friendships based on intellectual common interests, just like the chaps do. But that possibility seems to have been an imaginative stretch too far for Mr Lee who, despite a pseudo-feminist nod towards injustice from lack of recognition for Mary Anning's work, ultimately preferred to revert to a standard stereotypical and sexist view of the nature and capabilities of women in his treatment of Charlotte Murchison. As another reviewer notes - the film actually portrays less acknowledgement of the contributions to science of both characters, than scientific and general society did at that time. This seems beyond ironic in this post-#MeToo time.On the positive side: the period and Mary Anning's day-to-day life were well recreated.",Ammonite

This film has strong performances all around, but Winslet shines especially bright. It's difficult to play such a closed, stoic character and yet communicate the depth of her emotion in a way that draws us in, but Ms. Winslet does so masterfully, reminding us why she is often called the greatest actress of her generation.

155,herstories,Agree with others - missed opportunity,6,17 April 2021,"Ammonite - Kate Winslet, Saoirse Ronan, Gemma Jones, Fiona Shaw - will be using their abbreviated names later.First, LOVE these actors. Love to see them here from other lesbian dramas: Gemma (from Gentleman Jack) and Fiona (from Killing Eve).Now my thoughts on the movie:Storyline is underdeveloped, too simple, when the movie sucks it doesn't do the heroine any justice, especially if it's a significant historical figure that hasn't gotten any attention because she was a woman. And according to the internet she didn't have a lesbian relationship with SR's character, Charlotte Murchison.Sex scenes were downright un-believable and shows that men (gay or straight) should not be directing or writing lesbian movies (only exception I would give is for ""Carol""). Completely tasteless.Kate W's acting is amazing. Top-notch. Saoirse looks too young sometimes in this movie and acts rather bland most of the time. (You can say it's her character but then you look at KW's character, very few words are spoken but she plays her with so much emotion that we really feel her character and KW communicates through the screen beautifully).*spoilers below*My favorite part was when they attend the house party with musicians, invited by their town doctor who seemed to be interested in KW. KW is so uncomfortable and you can tell she hated being there, then she was jealous seeing SR talking to FS. So she just left, went home in the rain. And SR comes back saying she was abandoned, when she sat with FS in the front row (I think every girl knows exactly how KW felt at that moment).Another interesting fact is, Mary Anning is a contemporary of Anne Lister. But the movie has a much more modern feel than Gentleman Jack. I think they didn't do their period research correctly.IMDb reviews were pretty on point, and SA definitely had a nose job because it's too perfect.",Ammonite

158,charlesgwbrewer,Invented sex life of interesting woman - Badly directed garbage,1,29 October 2021,"As I understand it, Mary Anning was an interesting amateur palaeontologist whose work was much admired by the more academic and professional members of learned London societies.With a background quite unlike those of the men from London, she was unlikely ever to have been noticed, but, like the more fortunate Ada Lovelace, Marie Curie and few other women of the same era, managed to break through some of the social barriers and difficulties to establish her name as a serious practitioner.In real life, rather like Basil Brown whose story was recently and splendidly told in 'The Dig'. But then he was a man and so was portrayed as actually doing what Brown did in real life.Instead of telling the remarkable story of a woman (indeed woman or man, the story is not significantly more or less remarkable in either case) whose social background provided a huge impediment, this film heads off into a completely fictitious lesbian story. How insulting can you get? As if being a lesbian is in any way as significant as being one of the founders of palaeontology, and as if a real poor person (man or woman) from a provincial background making herself noticed by the learned societies of London wasn't of massively more importance than a lie.But then for modern film makers it would appear that the only interesting thing about women is sex.",Ammonite
159,yudyyang,"Quiet, Delicate, Exquisite, Beautiful, Whatever you want for your relationship",10,10 December 2020,"Some people said they didn't really see the lead-ups of their love story, and the storyline was not convincing. I do not mean to offend anyone, but I believe I saw the lead-ups quit clearly while enjoying the movie. Mary firstly found a rock at a high place, and she climbed up to get it. Unfortunately, that rock got broken while falling to the ground, and the ammonite fossil in it broke apart. We can see how upset Mary was when she looked at that broken fossil. When she walked with Charlotte on the beach and saw another rock thing at a high place again, her heart struggled that if she should go get it. Mary was totally devoted to the fossil science, she couldn't bear another heartbreak seeing a fossil break apart in front of her. She chose not to dig that rock thing out. Charlotte didn't know much about the science and Mary's fear at that time. In Charlotte's mind, Mary's job was just digging things out and nothing more. Mary felt offended by Charlotte, so she poured her anger on and insulted Charlotte heavily. Charlotte then left and almost got drowned to death on the beach. Thanks to the bathing, Charlotte got fever in the next morning, but she still rather went to the store and asked for Mary's help than the maid's in the hotel. Why was Mary better than the maid? Because the maid listened to Roderick's, and any other men's, orders, but Mary made decisions and orders on her own. Mary was much reliable than the maid. If Charlotte chose to depend on the maid, she might die already and the story would be ended, immediately. However, considered Mary's bad attitude on the other day, Charlotte might rely on Mary only for a hope to be survived. In fact, Mary still disliked Charlotte when the doctor asked her to take good care of Charlotte. However, when the doctor said that it's Mary's position to care for a ""fellow sister"", Mary realized, once again, in the men's world, under this situation, Charlotte could only rely on her. The sympathy to another woman made Mary keep Charlotte home. During the days, Mary understood Charlotte's sadness and helplessness little by little, and started to have some feeling for Charlotte. When Charlotte woke up, she's surprised for being saved by Mary. She was even thankful when she heard the doctor commended Mary. Charlotte's opinion on Mary started changing. When she asked for Mary's permission to go onto the beach, it turned out Mary cared more about her own thoughts. She liked Mary even more from that moment. Later, Charlotte saw how Mary handled things masterly, and in contrast, she's more like a child who's lack of skills. This was the time when Charlotte started to admire Mary. Charlotte wanted to approach closer to Mary. When the doctor came with the invitation only for Mary, Mary fight for Charlotte's love to music. That was the moment Charlotte discovered how much Mary respected and knew about her. Charlotte was so annoyed when she's getting dressed up by the maid, but she gladly let Mary help her and shared her fragrance with Mary. We can even see Charlotte's disappointed face when Mary was asked away by Molly. Charlotte wanted Mary to be with her. That's why she initially held Mary's hand in front of the door, she got a bit angry over Mary's left, and earnestly complimented Mary after reading Mary's heart-broken poetry. The poetry showed us that Mary was in love with Charlotte already. I would say, her love could be tracked back to the days she looked after Charlotte. The days she witnessed Charlotte's weakness. Mary flinched on that night, although Charlotte's love was so obvious. The next day when they worked on the beach again, Charlotte cared about that rock thing so much because she cared about Mary's passion on fossil. Mary didn't want that rock because she couldn't move it herself, yet she didn't want Charlotte's help. She was trying to deny the love between her and Charlotte, but she failed because Charlotte insisted to dig that rock thing out and bring it home. In the next scenario, I don't think I can find any other fangirl in the world who could've done better than Charlotte. Charlotte was literally Mary's Stan. These lead-ups were many enough to show us how they fell in love with each other. I can't even imagine how they could NOT fall in love with each other after all these things happened between them. Trust me. This is a beautiful and soulful enough love story that deserves you see more than once.",Ammonite
160,conradpollock,A Heart of Melted Stone,10,18 October 2020,"Ammonite's title is deceptive, being not just about a fossil, but linking directly to the character of Mary Anning, hard and curled up against the world around her. Years of scouting beaches and digging in the dirt, only to have her work credited to men in London, has left her cold and brittle. The arrival of depressed young woman Charlotte however, soon challenges her countenance.
Filmmaker Francis Lee balances the grit and dirt of Mary's excavations with the high Victorian society Charlotte is from with ease and interesting perspective. The film is about downtrodden individuals, spurned by a number of issues from the period, gaining perspective that they're not as alone as they once thought.
Winslet and Ronan play excellently off each other, with Ronan taking on a role you can imagine a young Winslet would have played. Their performance culminates in one of the most intimate love scenes I've seen onscreen for sometime. Knowing that the two actors were allowed to choreograph this themselves with minimal interference is worthy as well, and shows care taken in crafting the relationship.
Clearly this film hasn't clicked with everyone, and it'd probably be best to leave any pre-conceptions of what a 'lesbian film' should include at the door. But if given a fair chance, 'Ammonite' could breathe new interest into the life of a British historic figure.",Ammonite
161,sarahaldridge-36675,A disservice to real historical figures,6,8 November 2021,"The direction in Ammonite is an odd one to say the least. This film takes two incredible real historical figures who have fascinating and feminist real stories... and pretty much ignores them.You would be forgiven for going into this film expecting a depiction of the wonderful Mary Anning, with a little unnecessary but harmless conjecture as to a hint of something more between two real life historical women. Unfortunately this is absolutely not what this film is! It is pretty much only a romance, and a sweet but ultimately unconvincing one at that. I have noticed that those who loved this film do say that they are previously unaware of Mary Anning. Please read up about the real achievements of these women before making your mind up.It is strange that the director chose Mary Anning and Charlotte Murchison to be the subjects for such a film, considering their rich real stories which genuinely provide all the content you could possibly want for an in inspiring and informative feminist biopic. Despite being a woman and of lower class, Mary continued incredible work through hardship, lack of recognition and disrespect on the basis of her sex and class. Even the extensive geological work of Charlotte Murchison is now recognised. Unfortunately this film decides to push Mary's real story aside, merely featuring it as a back story used as a tool to bring these women together, and Charlotte's scientific contributions are omitted entirely! We see multiple bleak grey scenes where you could assume the weather is used as a metaphor, but it doesn't much improve after the women come together. This is nothing against Kate Winslet and Saorise Roman, who are incredible in everything and this film is no different. Unfortunately I think due to the nature of the characters, the romance is never quite believable. And THAT sex scene. It just goes on for so long and so far and leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination. I would not be surprised If it is now on pornhub! As a bi woman, I did not appreciate it and thought it wholly unnecessary as it didn't really add anything at all to the romance. It was such a change of pace and completely unbelievable for these two Victorian women. (Fair play to Kate & Saorise though).Putting the erasure of real stories aside, Ammonite is visually beautiful and gets elements such as setting, costume and casting absolutely right. (And gets a 6 from me for these reasons)For years and throughout her lifetime, Mary Anning was overlooked and undervalued for her skill, achievements and contributions to science. Disappointingly, this film continues that trend.I am looking forward to a film supposedly soon to come out 'Mary Anning and the Dinosaur Hunters.' Hopefully this coming biopic will finally do her justice.",Ammonite
