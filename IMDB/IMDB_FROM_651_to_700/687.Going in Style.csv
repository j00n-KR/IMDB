0,MartinHafer,Thoroughly adequate....nothing more.,5,1 September 2018,"""Going in Style"" was a movie that debuted back in 1979. Now, 38 years later, Hollywood has done a remake of this comedy. I am not particularly a fan of remakes...and this one did nothing to change my opinion.Three old men have just learned their pension fund has been looted...so they decide to rob a bank (the connection seemed to make little sense to me). The film is about these old geezers (Alan Arkin, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine) and their robbery....which came off amazingly well considering none of them had committed any crimes before this.The problem with the film is the 'meh factor'. In other words, after seeing the film, I felt very ambivalent....and I neither liked nor disliked it. A time-passer....nothing more.",Going in Style
1,bkoganbing,Old timers show their stuff again,7,5 December 2017,"Although the seriousness of the plight of us elderly is treated with respect as it was in the first version of Going In Style, this new version has a lot more laughs and a much happier ending all around except maybe for FBI agent Matt Dillon. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Alan Arkin are the three new old geezers and they're so good you forget that Caine hasn't even tried to discard his cockney speech pattern. In better times these two would be sitting on the park bench just reminiscing about the past, listening to the arteries harden, talk about friends who recently passed on and play with grandkids. But these are not ordinary times. The bank in one of their read between the lines mortgages is about to evict Caine from his house and both Caine and Freeman are about to lose their pensions from the company they work for. Capitalism at its unregulated best.These old geezers aren't taking it lying down, they're going to rob the Williamsburg Savings Bank located in the tallest building in Brooklyn. I loved the scenes where they plan and execute the robbery, the seniors are fast learners and good improvisers. They also are great comrades in fact one makes a big sacrifice for another. They also share the loot with some deserving people, those scenes are precious indeed. I can't forget mentioning Christopher Lloyd who plays one of their Alzheimer stricken friends. Laugh there are in Lloyd's performance, but a bit poignancy as well. He's used by one of them as an alibi for the time of the robbery. His interrogation by Matt Dillon is hysterical.A big sendup for gray power, that's what Going In Style is.",Going in Style
2,SnoopyStyle,old geezer bank robbers,6,24 December 2017,"Joe Harding (Michael Caine) goes to the bank to confront his banker who is threatening to take his home. He has his daughter Rachel and granddaughter Brooklyn (Joey King) living with him. He witnesses a bank robbery and FBI Agent Arlen Hamer (Matt Dillon) dismisses him. He, and his friends Willie Davis (Morgan Freeman) and Albert Garner (Alan Arkin) lose their pension after a merger that moves the plant overseas. Willie needs a kidney and Albert has a fling with Annie Santori (Ann-Margret). As difficulties mount, the guys decide to rob a bank.This should be better than this. The grocery store robbery is silly. I'd rather they go buy guns and do a straight up robbery movie. They could skip a lot of this. Ann-Margret adds little more than senior babe quotient. The robbery and what happens after lacks reality. Not that reality should be holding this back. I do like some moments like the fake tattoo and finding the bank has taken their pension fund. This needs more. It needs to be funnier and/or more thrilling. The caper needs to be sharper. Zach Braff does a competent job and the movie is generally competent but not more than that.",Going in Style
3,Prismark10,Robbing in style,5,8 October 2017,"Going In Style is a remake of the 1979 film directed by Martin Brest. The remake is directed by Zach Braff.Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Alan Arkin are old age pensioners stiffed by their employers pension fund when it is restructured. Now unable to have money to pay their everyday expenses, at risk of losing their home and they decide to rob the bank involved in swindling their pension fund.This is an amiable old men comedy, veterans who were law abiding citizens but now training to rob a bank with all their various ailments.It is a nicely played feel good comedy with some predictable twists and relies on the interplay of the cast but it all feels a bit too familiar.",Going in Style
4,nogodnomasters,"Anxiety, pain, seizure, stress",8,5 July 2017,"This is a remake of the 1979 film of the same name and I predict 20-30 years from now, there will be another one. Three curmudgeons felt cheated by the system decide to get back with a bank robbery, another over-the-hill gang film not to be confused with anything that has Hatton Garden in the title. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Alan Arkin are partners in crime. The film also includes Ann Margaret whose picture is still on my ceiling and Christopher Lloyd whose isn't.The theme of the feature is that the younger generation should take care of the older generation and if you are on a fixed income, NYC is not the place to be. Also having retired from a company after working there for 30 years and still paying on a mortgage is not where you want to be either. Mortgage paid off, then retirement. You don't need to pay a certified financial adviser to know that much.This is a typically formula fun film. No swearing, sex, or nudity.",Going in Style
5,kosmasp,Retired (?),7,16 October 2017,"Let's hope not, for a long time. While it's not a perfect movie, the 3 leads are so charismatic, they carry anything the movie throws at them. Some things may bit coincidental and may feel too convenient, but again you won't be thinking about that while watching the movie. You know a couple of things just by watching the movie and you can almost guess the ""twists"" entirely.That still doesn't take away too much of the fun you can have while watching it. Dialog is nice and they play into the generation thing (social media, wordplay and of course limitations of age). But all in a really respectful way and yet still funny. If you like to have a good old time (no pun intended), you could do worse",Going in Style
6,classicsoncall,"""Let's go get our money back!""",7,12 April 2017,"Quite coincidentally, and without knowing a remake was in the works, I caught the original ""Going in Style"" just about three months ago for the first time. That one had three stellar actors in the principal roles with George Burns, Art Carney and Lee Strasberg as retirees trying to make ends meet. It's tough to make a call as to which trio was more effective when comparing the two films, although I thought the original film had just a bit more heart. Even so, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Alan Arkin pulled off the buddy relationship admirably in turning the tables on the corporate entities that froze their pensions and put their retirements in jeopardy.So let's see. 2016 brought us a 'Power to the People, Stick it to the Man' plot line with ""Captain Fantastic"", and this film picks up the same theme, almost looking like it lifted the supermarket shoplifting idea from the earlier flick. I saw both films almost back to back so the similarity in the stories was more than evident. Where I thought this story got a little muddled was in the way each of the principals seemed to plan out their alibis individually. The only credible one was Albert (Arkin), involved in a randy relationship with a more than willing neighbor Annie, portrayed by Ann-Margret. The lengths to which Joe (Caine) and Willie (Freeman) went in order to avoid detection as criminals defied credibility to my thinking. Creative yes, but these were guys hitting their Eighties and not exactly Mensa candidates when you come right down to it.Even so, the film did a pretty good job teaming up these present day film icons who in reality are all themselves in their eighties or just about (Freeman in a couple more months as I write this). So in that regard, they have a leg up on the original cast in which Art Carney was a mere newcomer at sixty one when he appeared in the 1979 picture. It might be interesting to speculate who might be considered for the next remake in another thirty years or so. How about George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon? If I'm still around, I might go see it.",Going in Style
7,lee_eisenberg,bank on it,8,18 December 2017,"A number of movies in the past decade have looked at the role that the banks played in crashing the economy, but few have looked at how these banks - and other corporations - affected people individually. Zach Braff's ""Going in Style"" shows how a company lays off its workers and wipes out their pensions. No surprise that three of the laid-off employees decide to rob a bank in response.The movie manages to be funny every step of the way. The delivery from Michael Caine, Alan Arkin and Morgan Freeman helps (I guess that they could've increased the cool factor by having Morgan Freeman narrate). A pleasant surprise was seeing Ann-Margret in the movie as Alan Arkin's character's love interest. She still looks great after all these years.I was surprised to learn that this was a remake. I hope to see the original. In the meantime, this is one that you'll enjoy. Christopher Lloyd must've had a lot of fun filming his scenes.",Going in Style
8,Quinoa1984,"Good for what it is, which is good enough (though mostly for the cast)",6,7 April 2017,"So here's the thing: if you told me, out of the blue, with no context whatsoever, that there was a heist flick with Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Alan Arkin and Ann-Margaret (or you could have me at just Caine) where they plot to rob the Brooklyn bank that's screwed them over after a royal f***-over from their blue collar job, I'd say 'sign me up!' That it would also be a comedy wouldn't be so bad an enticement either; one might be reminded of something that could've starred these same actors from the 70's (ever seen The Hot Rock?) and spiked with some relevant social issues. Matter of fact, as I only recently learned, this is a *remake* of a movie from the 70's (whether it had the same horrible-bank horrible-company thing I'm sure I don't know).The problem is it's now 2017 and their age can't be taken out of the text of the film - this is the Grumpy Old Men or even The Bucket List of NYC heist movies - and the director Zach Braff is a hack. Sorry, but... no, I'm not sorry to type that. While I haven't Wish I Was Here, Garden State is not simply in retrospect but what I knew at the time to be an unconvincing and cloying indie that had some decent acting and (not mutually exclusive) some highly self-conscious directorial moves and writing that... well, it didn't date well then much less now.I don't mean to beat up on Braff's film - good for him for making a movie, it wasn't a crime or anything - except to point to how in his third film out he has moved up to now making an unconvincing and typical and safe middle-brow comedy. It's not that the trailer even showed anything like an edge, but... damn, he could've tried, not to mention some twists and reveals near the end that made me groan so loud I got looks from some of the AARP folks in the theater. Oh, and the social issues are dealt kind of up front and we only sort of see the consequences/ramifications of what this does to people (it's closer to the depth of something like Tower Heist in that way).And yet I have an admiration for this movie getting to see these faces and, at the least, Braff doesn't get too much in the way of Caine and Freeman and Arkin to do what they can with Melfi's also safe script. They work well together and I found myself laughing more than I expected from if not all of the dialog (though there's one or two clever moments from Melfi) then from how they deliver it. There's lifetimes of experience and knowledge and depths of pathos from these actors, even with Arkin who always seems to be Cranky-Ass Arkin (but this is likely an act, so to simply be this personality so convincingly is impressive), and they play off with as much comedy as they can get from the supporting cast like Christopher Lloyd as a dementia-ish Knights of Columbus fellow and Ann Margaret as Arkin's would-be love interest.The heist itself is shown in broad strokes and we can buy it because, um, movie. I was fine with most of it, up until it strains credulity though this is largely when the alibis have to come out and all of the loose ends come together (and even here I could believe it, at least in the predictable-safe world its set in). Maybe my critical standards are getting rusty and I should harsher on this, not the least because it features a set-up involving a botched preparatory theft of... ingredients for Chicken Cordon-Bleu from a small super-market that is paid off in a way that makes less sense than it should. I wanted it to do a little more, but what it gave me was fine - I may just be a sucker for this cast and that, for what morsels they're given, they do as much and then some with it. It's an excellent Laundromat Movie: if it came on while I was doing/waiting for my laundry, I'd be highly satisfied.In a theater.... ehhh... Extra points too for Matt Dillon as a non-plussed cop and a humorous Keenan Thompson as the security hack at the super-market.",Going in Style
9,CinemaSerf,Three old blokes flicking the V to the system....,7,6 January 2020,"A comedy crime drama about three old codgers who get ripped off by their bank and their former employer and who decide to seek revenge by robbing the bank. Alan Arkin, Morgan Freeman and Sir Michael Caine brings loads of charm, quite a bit of wit and are simply not afraid to look/act their ages in this gently amusing heist movie. There is certainly a chemistry between the three, and they also manage to instil, in the audience, a sort of righteousness in what they are doing. The writing is good, each has some good quips - made more funny, often, by the expert delivery in a sort of ""dead pan"" fashion. Ann-Margret and Matt Dillon also add a little bit of richness to this, too. It isn't complex humour, but nonetheless enjoyable for that.",Going in Style

What we have is a pleasant little time-passer with actors who know what they're doing and know how to do it in their sleep. Three top name-above-the-title stars and solid support from the likes of Christopher Lloyd and Ann Margaret and the fact that it makes some pertinent points on old age along the way and without actually getting in the way is a bonus.",Going in Style
11,zardoz-13,Old Guys Rule!!!,8,10 April 2017,"Remakes shouldn't carbon copy the originals. ""Garden State"" director Zach Braff of ""Scrubs"" and ""Hidden Figures"" scenarist Theodore Melfi have jettisoned more from the original ""Going in Style"" than you might expect, but they also have lightened up the tone with amusing shenanigans and gags galore. Initially, ""Going in Style"" (1979) blended low-key comedy with grim drama in its straightforward depiction of brazen oldsters who engineered a bank heist wearing little more than dime-store disguises, essentially Groucho Marx masks, with big black glasses, big bulging noses, and big droopy mustaches. George Burns, Art Carney, and Les Strasberg starred as the ambitious old geezers who held up a bank because they were bored with their daily routine of sitting on a park bench. Sadly, those three old-timers didn't live happily ever after once they got away with the goods. Two of them croaked after the crime, and the mastermind surrendered and served time. Ultimately, the mastermind refused to divulge the location of the loot. In the end, he decided that he could break out of the prison with little difficulty. Imagine George Burns imitating the perennially pugnacious Humphrey Bogart, and you'll have a good idea what a hard-boiled egg Burns made as the ringleader of the elderly triumvirate. If you've never heard of George Burns, he was the cigar-smoking comedian who made the ""Oh, God!"" trilogy. In their ""Going in Style"" remake, Braff and Melfi have preserved the premise about three seniors who decide to stage a bank robbery. Braff and Melfi stick with the same three names of the original characters: Joe, Al, and Willie, but change their color and nationality. Typically, Hollywood prefers to reward altruistic characters who perform good deeds and punish villains for their selfish, wicked ways. Comparatively, Braff's ""Going in Style"" remake relies far more on feel-good fantasy than abrasive drama, and the characters are not the original skeleton crew. Braff and Melfi have gone to considerable lengths to flesh out each character so these individuals boast stronger motivations about turning to a life of crime despite the possibility of not only shooting up a bank but also being shot by anyone during the robbery. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Alan Arkin step into the shoes of George Burns, Art Carney, and Les Strasberg as the three codgers who committed the crime. Happily, the new Willie, Al, and Joe enjoy greater success than their predecessors after they carried out their criminal enterprise.""Going in Style"" never lets one of the three heroes outshine the other two in terms of extended or abbreviated screen time. Willie (Morgan Freeman of ""Driving Miss Daisy""), Al (Oscar-winning actor Alan Arkin of ""Argo,"" and Joe (Oscar-winning actor Michael Caine) neither live together nor contend with the dried-up, depressing, boring lives that their predecessors endured with death looming on the horizon. Rather than robbing a bank out of sheer boredom, the three new protagonists resort to bank robbery because the company that employed them for 30 years has frozen their pensions and it is stashing that pension money in a local bank for other purposes. Willie, Al, and Joe attend the public meeting at their old company, and they walk away with rage in their hearts. Willie teeters on the verge of death from a bad kidney, but refuses to alarm them. His doctor warns him he must locate a donor because his chances of acquiring a new kidney are slim to none. Al gave the best years of his life to the same company, but he abhors the idea of sticking up a bank. Eventually, he decides to join them. Ultimately, the driving force behind the bank robbery caper is Joe because he has overdrawn his checking account and is poised to lose his home. In the original, Willie, Al, and Joe all shared the same house. Furthermore, the original protagonists were all Caucasian, while the latest group emerges as diverse, multi-cultural triad. African-American, Jewish-American, and British, without a White Anglo-Saxon in sight. Like the original, the individual who formulates the strategy for stealing thousands of bucks at gunpoint is Joe. Not only does Joe fear he will lose his house, but he also dreads the prospect that his granddaughter, Brooklyn (Joey King of ""The Conjuring"") and her mother, Rachel (Maria Dizzia of ""Margin Call"") won't have a place to live after his eviction. Joe is oblivious to his monetary woes until he visits his bank and discovers his dire straits. While he is learning about his woebegone financial status, three masked felons decked out in black suits with assault rifles burst into the bank and threaten to shoot anybody who doesn't cooperate. They make all the customers lay on the floor and they go from one bank cashier to the next watching each as they dish out the dough and put it in their satchels. The efficiency and speed of these three bank robbers stun Joe. Indeed, this robbery scene reminded me of the scene in director Michael Mann's classic caper ""Heat"" (1995) with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Like his predecessor in the 1979 original, Joe has a difficult time persuading his two lifelong friends to accompany him to the Williamsburg Savings Bank in Brooklyn with pistols and masks. Unlike their predecessors, these three decide to learn a little about bank robbery from a pro, Jesús (John Ortiz of ""Kong: Skull Island""), who operates a dog grooming business, but moonlights as a bank robber. Jesús trains them in every aspect of a hold-up, and they cut him in for a quarter of the loot. When Willie, Al, and Joe enter the bank, they have a clue about what they're doing, and they maintain a timetable so as to escape before the police arrive.""Going in Style"" generates lots of comedy and some spine-tingling suspense. Predictable in certain respects, this immaculate bank robbery caper never wears out its welcome, with heroes that you can respect and root for in their efforts to make good.",Going in Style

13,HotToastyRag,Hilarious and respectful,9,30 November 2017,"Going in Style isn't one of those typical ""let's make fun of old people"" films. Yes, it has a few gags about old age, but the majority of the film is just about three men, who happen to have white hair. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Alan Arkin are three friends barely making ends meet. Morgan can't afford to visit his family, Michael's in danger of losing his home, and Alan clips coupons along with many other retirees whose Social Security doesn't cover all expenses. After Michael is present during a bank robbery, he comes up with the idea of robbing a bank himself, with a little help from his friends.Michael and Morgan are given the most acting to do, since Alan is mainly the comic relief, and they are wonderful. They could have easily written the film off as a silly comedy and thrown their lines away, but both of them put their whole hearts behind their performances. Joining the supporting cast is Ann-Margaret, who inexplicably has a crush on Alan Arkin instead of the dreamy Michael Caine. She's basically the same as she was in Grumpy Old Men, but it's nice to see her still in circulation. Matt Dillon, who hasn't aged a day since Crash, Josh Pais, Christopher Lloyd, and Richie Moriarty also have small but memorable parts.These days, it's extremely expensive to go to the theaters, and we often find ourselves saying, ""Eh, I'll just rent it."" I went to the theaters to see Going in Style, and it was worth every cent. This movie is hilarious, heartwarming, and extremely entertaining. If you just want to laugh at old people, go rent Dirty Grandpa or Last Vegas. But if you're looking for three Academy Award winning actors in a very sweet story, better acting than you'd expect in a comedy, and a film that respects older actors, this is one of the best.",Going in Style
14,DKosty123,Love The Cast - Script Is So-So,7,4 March 2018,"The star power is here. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Alan Arkin and a cast that is stellar is why I have a 7 here. But meanwhile, back at the ranch, while this film takes great pains to explain why they get away with the heist, it fails to explain enough that even a rookie cop would find out they did it.I do like the off-shoring screwing over seniors by a corporation offshoring their company and stealing their pensions. The thing is nobody ever bothers to explain that this happens because of the 1986 tax law changes which made it possible for corporations to make money doing this and has literally screwed an entire 32 years of American workers so far. This is an example of the light weight script. Another thing is when they are giving out money to the friends they leave the bank id bands around the bundles of money. With out a logical explanation of why the police would not realize that this is robbery money, it shoots down the great carnival explanation of why the cops can not prove they did the robbery.

15,Hellmant,"A predictable disappointment, but still a disappointment.",5,20 September 2017,"'GOING IN STYLE': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A remake of the 1979 heist comedy (of the same name) starring George Burns, Art Carney and Lee Strasberg (and written by Martin Brest). This updated version stars Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Alan Arkin; as three retirees that plot to rob a bank together, after they all lose their pensions. It was directed by actor turned director Zach Braff (who's 2004's 'GARDEN STATE' was one of my favorite movies of that year), and it was written by Theodore Melfi (who also wrote and directed 2014's 'ST. VINCENT', and co-wrote 2016's 'HIDDEN FIGURES'). It costars Joey King, Matt Dillon, Christopher Lloyd, Ann-Margret and John Ortiz. The film has gotten mediocre reviews from critics, but it was also a mild hit at the Box Office. I found it to be pretty routine and predictable, nothing more and nothing less.Joe (Caine), Willie (Freeman) and Albert (Arkin) are three senior citizens, and best friends, that live in New York. They also (suddenly) all lose their pensions, when the company they worked for is bought. After Joe witnesses a bank robbery, while having an extremely frustrating visit to his bank, he comes up with the idea that the three old friends should rob a bank together. Initially Willie and Albert think the idea is crazy, but they eventually come to like the outrageous plan.The film is an extremely upbeat family friendly comedy, that I'm sure older viewers (and families) could easily enjoy. There's absolutely nothing original, or skillfully executed, in the film; and it's about as routine and predictable as movies can get. That's fine if that's what you're looking for (in a film), but Braff can deliver so much more as a director, Melfi can deliver so much more in a script, and the talented cast can all deliver much better performances as well.

But as ridiculous as the premise is, there's some unexpected enjoyment to be had here.Going in Style is directed by Zach Braff of all people. The guy who brought us Garden State? Yep. I imagine this was a situation where he saw an opportunity to work with three of the greatest actors of this generation and took it, instead of this being some sort of passion project on his part. But that really is the selling point of the movie, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Alan Arkin. Each are legends on their own, but seeing all three of them together is a pleasure for any film fan. These three have taken some heat in the past about appearing in mediocre films and giving mediocre performances, with some even accusing them of ""mailing it in"". Luckily, there's none of that here. You can tell the three of them had a blast filming together and it clearly shows in the final product. The film won't knock your socks off, but I'll watch anything with these actors.It's not all giggles, though. There's a deeper message in Going in Style about living your life until the very end, and not sitting back and letting others ruin your life. I'm not sure the film truly succeeded in that sense or I was getting a little sad at potentially watching my favorite actors realize their own mortality. Strangely enough, this is where the film is at its best. Whether its watching these guys tear up at the site of the granddaughters, or just busting each other over the smallest of things, I felt like I was watching them go through real-life issues. It sounds silly, especially considering they're all doing just fine financially in real life, but I felt really bad for these guys.However, as expected, this movie is just plain ridiculous. The believability is off the charts and the writing is not good, to say the least. I like Theodore Melfi a lot, actually. St. Vincent is one of my favorite films of all time and Hidden Figures is gold, but I can't get behind his work here. I'm not sure whether it was a choice of some of the supporting actors, Braff's call, or in Melfi's script, but there's some really dumb stuff in this film.As a whole, I had fun with Going in Style. It's far from perfect, and it can even be cringe worthy at times, but the emotions I got from seeing three actors you love truly sink their teeth into real- life problems of mortality was enough for me.+Actors having a blast+Well put together goofy heist film-But sometimes it's a little too goofy6.8/10",Going in Style

19,lesleyharris30,"Great Cast, Great Fun,",8,1 May 2017,"Going in Style is a terrific movie with a well developed plot and a stellar comedic cast. It's a ridiculously fun movie as we watch a trio of elderly men joining forces to pull off a bank heist, the conflicting personalities of the three men and the ongoing banter between them is without a doubt the film's highlight. It is directed by Scrubs' star Zach Braff, which will come as no surprise to fans of his work, his comedic contributions are very present throughout. It does, however, fail at being heartwarming, I feel like the whole film would have worked better without it, because it is difficult to gain an emotional connection with bank robbers. Plot devices, such as Joe's relationship with his granddaughter, or Albert's new love affair, fall flat at their attempts to make the audience feel. The cast is phenomenal, the chemistry and immediate connection between Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Alan Arkin is stellar, the three of them clearly got along so well, and it is the main thing that makes this entire experience worthwhile. It is laugh riot that had me in stitches on more than one occasion. Funny and very well casted, I would certainly recommend Going in Style to anyone looking for a good comedy. Three elderly men decide to pull off a bank heist to get back at the banks for all they have done to them, but they must learn the trick of the trade first.

All justifying our Robin Hood trios rationale to hit back and take a couple million as compensation for losing their pensions, and, of course, give half to charities (sure!). Lots of jokes about old age with concurrent mental/physical decline to make the task worth a movie's storyline (not that it hasn't been told countless times before). Lots of clichéd banter to try and rescue fairly rote acting. Final message of our predictable happy ending's planning unfolds is that ""Society should take care of it's elderly."" I wonder if the script, in part, is a gentle slap at Trump business philosophy developed from his inherited wealth and property flipping financial gains at society's expense. At least they didn't pile on his supposed mild bone spurs and multiple student (haha) exemptions to escape service in the Vietnam war.",Going in Style
22,The-Sarkologist,The Golden Years,7,29 April 2017,"This is actually a rather interesting movie because I guess it deals with an aspect of our society that seems to become ever more neglected the further we go along, and that is respect for our elders. In fact, this is a line that is raised at the beginning of the film, and also later on in the film, which does work to answer a question that we never thought needed answering. The one thing that this film seems to confront us with is how we tend to write off the elderly as being has beens and a burden, when in reality it confronts us with the fact that they still have a significant role to play in our society – if we let them.Before I go deeper into looking at some of the things with this film I should probably say a few things about the plot. Basically the film is about three elderly men who have found that old age is presenting challenges of its own, namely that the money that they thought that they would be able to rely upon after finishing off work is no longer available. As such they are finding themselves being squeezed, and the world of the young are ever more treating them as if they were a burden as opposed to recognising them for their contribution. When it comes clear that the bank that they bank with is in cahoots with their old employer in attempting to swindle them out of their pension, they decide to get revenge, by robbing it.I'm probably giving a little too much away now by saying that it is actually a feel good movie, though one aspect of it was that the film not only seemed to end rather suddenly, but it really didn't seem to have any real direction. Then again I guess that is a part of us trying to understand the nature of old age – in our younger years we all have direction, and focus, but once we have retired a part of us seems to feel that we have accomplished everything and it is now time to sit back an relax – which is probably why the movie just seems to drift in a lot of places.The thing that stands out with this film is that it stars some rather big name actors who you could say are in their golden, or sunset, years of their life. Well, maybe not Allan Arkin (that is a big name actor, but then again he doesn't really hit my radar all that much), but certainly the others do stand out. In a way the stars of this movie are probably beyond the time when they will have producers knocking on their doors begging them to do one more film, but in another way these actors have left a legacy, and are now reminding us that the elderly are not a burden, but a treasure – they are fun, funny, and in some cases quite loving and caring. This is the crux of the film though - our society has lost its respect for the elderly, and in many cases we want to push them aside because they are no longer productive, and the only useful human is a productive human.The other rather cool thing about this film was that it did seem to attract the young, and the young at heart, and the response from the audience was that they actually did quite enjoy the film. Okay, while I didn't necessarily consider it to be one of the best films that I have seen, it was rather enjoyable, even though I didn't necessarily find it all that funny. I guess in the end what this film does suggest is that just because you are old doesn't necessarily mean that your life is over.",Going in Style

24,Reno-Rangan,"In an alternative way, against all the odds, they fought it!",7,24 October 2017,"This was a remake of the 1979 film of the same name. I haven't seen that, but I enjoyed this version. I did not say I liked, but very entertaining. From 'Grandma Gangster' to 'Stand Up Guys', there you could find a few more that all these films have commonalities. The old fellows try to do something out of their age and strength can cope. So, for fun, this film will do just fine.The poster says it all, but the film reveals much detail, like with small twist and turns. Three lifelong friends suddenly feeling the heat after their pensions got messed up. Apart from that, serious health condition and other financial struggle force them to rob a bank. The film is going to tell us their preparations for the action and post heist developments with some close encounters.No one particular, but all the three veteran actors were good. Good to see them in such energetic film, other than supporting roles in other big flicks. Zack Braff too was good at his direction. I did not like that much his previous feature film. This is a commercial film, but well done. He says it is a reboot, not a remake. And seeing decent success, there could be a sequel. Simply watch it and have fun, but don't analyse deeply, which might only disappoint you.6.5/10",Going in Style
25,cruise01,"Lovable leads from Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Alan Arkin but wasted in a dull comedy film.",5,10 August 2017,"Going in Style tries to be a simple with its easy gags and laughs for this heist comedy film. It plays it safe but the humor gets repetitive and boring eventually. This is definitely the film were all the best parts and jokes are shown in the trailers. The jokes are trying to make it to be more of a classic comedy movie but it does leave you with less laughs. The plot is simple and kind of depressing. But it sure tries having that relatable theme about getting old and the new generation of people being disrespectful. And to make matters worse. The company that these lifelong friends Willie (Morgan Freeman), Joe (Michael Caine), and Albert (Alan Arkin) have worked for thirty or so years. Their benefits pension has been taken away from them. And even more bad news, Joe financial situation is having the bank take back his house unless he can pay it up. When Joe witnesses a bank robbery, and sees how the three robbers orchestrated their technique and escaped. He tries to convince Willie and Albert in trying to rob his bank to steal back their pension money. The plot is very predictable on how everything will play out. The characters were uninteresting and dull at times. When all they joke about is how the good times are gone and how their death bed is awaiting them. Which does make the film depressing. Especially when the jokes are ongoing about living their remaining years. Joe tries to rekindle his granddaughter relationship with her dead beat father, who was afraid to take the responsibility on being a parent. Willie is wishing he can see his family more especially his granddaughter. While his health is also worsening with his kidneys failing. Albert is playing hard to get with this grocery store clerk (Ann-Margret) who flirts with him anytime she gets. I love Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Alan Arkin's as actors. There talent felt a little wasted with a dull script. Even, Joey King as Joe's granddaughter felt like a waste. And Matt Dillion as a detective investigating the bank robbers was a waste. Sure, you may get a fun appearance from Christopher Lloyd as a dementia old guy. But those couple of minutes can not save the film or make it entertaining. Director Zach Braff took the reigns for this remake and tried to bring back that classic comedy style. The humor was dull and very little in every scene. It does have a great cast with their talent being wasted in a forgettable comedy film. It was not terrible it just was not as fun or funny that it was suppose to be.",Going in Style
26,eddie_baggins,Provides a few cheap laughs but that's it,4,28 November 2017,"You can see the great movie that could've been when watching Going in Style, Zach Braff's take on golden oldies getting up to no good but unfortunately the great movie eludes Braff and his team of beloved Hollywood veterans in a film that never achieves great laughs nor great heist heights.Enlisting an enviable trio in the form of Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Alan Arkin, Braff struggles to bring life to this rather ho-hum story of a group of aging factory workers who are all starring down the barrel of debt and financial heartache after their pensions have been revoked with the trio deciding there's no better way to answer their money needs than by robbing a bank.It's a simplistic set-up in a lot of ways but one that could provide a lot of cheap yet hearty laughs but Braff who wowed many a critic around the world with his directional debut Garden State, continues on with his mediocre stretch that included his last passion project Wish I Was Here and fails to mine any solid comedic gold from his capable cast and potentially rip-roaring pensioner lead heist.Centred around Caine's good hearted Joe and his two best friends/roommates in the form of Freeman's Willie and Arkin's cantankerous Albert, Style does allow these three ageing acting heavyweights time to showcase their charisma together but you feel like a lot of laughs are missed due to some fairly pedestrian writing and plotting that never meets the stars at their level.Some rather easy laughs are bought to proceedings like the 3 old-timers gathered around the TV watching a Batchelor finale or enjoying each other's company at their favourite 24hr diner but a lot of larger scale jokes fall flat and while the heist does liven up proceedings slightly once it hits, the lead up and planning stage of it will have many napping like a nanna on the couch.Final Say – No matter how bad things threaten to get there's a joy getting to watch three esteemed actors enjoy themselves on screen but the material in Going in Style is not worthy of the actors reputation. Blowing a potential old-school comedy classic on an easy to digest crowd pleaser that will be forgotten before too long, this is another misguided Zach Braff outing that makes you wonder if Garden State was but a flash in the pan.2 pieces of pie out of 5",Going in Style
27,TheMovieDiorama,Going In Style exuberantly moves along swiftly with extreme shallow depth.,5,10 March 2018,"Meaningless fun is the best description for this comedy caper that enables its central stars to relax and have a good laugh. Narratively speaking though, it lacks heft and bumbles along with its minimal emotional dialogue. Three old men are having trouble in their lives respectively, it all gets horribly worse when their pension is taken from the bank. They take it upon themselves to rob a bank and gain what is rightfully theirs because y'know, life is short. A story that has the best of intentions but ultimately fails to be memorable and unfortunately is only just mildly entertaining. The biggest compliment the film proposes is the dedication in showcasing its three central stars. Arkin, Caine and Freeman have excellent natural chemistry and give suitable performances. Nothing outstanding, just the usual delivery that they are all so famous for, but it's comforting. Braff's direction was fine, I liked some of the editing choices and scene transitions particularly during the interrogation where the picture transforms into split screen in order to traverse between all three characters. It all feels light, fluffy and simple fun. It's just a shame that it wastes the opportunity to elevate itself. The screenplay lacks emotion and suffers from predictability. Sure, some of the dialogue will make you smile not because it's funny, but the fact you feel bad if you don't. It attempts to highlight that retirement years aren't necessarily ""game over"" in which you can still achieve remarkable feats, but the weightlessness of the script prevents that. Far too empty and far too safe. The FBI agents were useless also, I mean I could've figured out who the culprits were in hours. If this was released ten or twenty years ago, this could be different review. However the mature comedy sub-genre, as niche as it is, is rapidly becoming saturated to which Going In Style plays it too safe to separate itself from the rest. Enjoyable, yet instantly forgettable.",Going in Style

In the original, the old timers were resorting to robbing a bank because of boredom and wanting to feel young again. In this version, they are forced into a criminal life because of necessity-they need the money because they have lost their pensions. Morgan, Michael & Alan are the 3 old friends on fixed incomes that decide to rob the bank that is foreclosing on Michael's house. Ann plays a woman at the local grocery store that likes Alan. One of the funniest scenes is when the guys decide to do a trail run on the grocery store, in preparation for robbing the bank-they try to steal groceries. They are not very good at it and decide to get help from a professional thief who gets them into shape. It's not laugh out loud funny but it is entertaining and I smiled a lot.

30,alindsay-al,An above average entertaining film,6,24 April 2017,"With the main cast of this film I definitely had some interest in this film and I have now seen it and i found it entertaining but nothing special at all. The premise of the film sees 3 older men attempt to rob a bank after the bank takes there pensions away from them. Michael Caine is the lead in this film and he is just great in this film, you can see he cares about this role and adds a lot of humour and drama to his performance. Morgan Freeman and Alan arkin are also in the film and the chemistry between the three performers is excellent. You buy there friendship and there chemistry together as old friends going through this ridiculous scenario. However, the rest of the supporting cast don't really add a lot to this film and I found some of there arcs to be a little silly. The story has some real entertainment as You see these three older gentleman practise and plan out this robbery and with the performances it is very entertaining. However, this film is pretty by the numbers and the last 20 minutes aren't as interesting as they should be. The script has some fun dialogue with a bit of decent dramatic dialogue but I don't really feel it hit the drama enough at certain times during the film. The style has some fun scenes especially involving a supermarket heist that I laughed a lot during. But as mentioned before I feel like the last act dragged on and hurt the film quite a bit.

31,iquine,"Spoon-fed, Forgettable Light Comedy",4,1 November 2017,"(Flash Review)This movie misses on all marks. As a comedy. As a drama. As action. As social commentary. The plot is rooted in social commentary of the easy to pick on banks who took advantage of many homeowners with balloon loans as well as big companies who move their operations overseas and dissolve hardworking people's pensions. The digs are clunky and shallow. Thus, three old farts get fed up with being financially screwed so they just decide to, you know, rob a bank. Their practice attempts, supposedly the funny part, were just so overdone and painfully dumb. Hollywood lined its pockets with this one with blatant product placements. The film got about a couple half cheek raises to generate a half smirk from me. Overall, this was a bait and switch movie.

33,jimbo-53-186511,A heist film with a heart,6,26 May 2018,"After discovering that their own bank is planning on ripping them off, three pensioners/lifelong friends decide to rob the very bank that ripped them off in the first place. Trouble is that they don't know the first thing about robbing a bank and must recruit a couple of shady outsiders to talk them through the process..When I saw that this film starred Alan Arkin, Morgan Freeman & Michael Caine ( a trio of very good veteran actors) I really hoped that Going In Style would be a great film. The bad news is that it isn't a great film, but the good news is that it is a good film.From the off our trio of pensioners are portrayed as being likeable men whom have worked hard all their lives and whom have been somewhat shafted by their bank. Whilst there's no condoning what they ultimately do it is at least possible to empathise with their actions. This is what essentially acts as the 'heart' of the film and is what basically drives the film forward; despite the negative plotting the men are essentially just trying to get back what was taken from them (and they even offer to give any amount above and beyond what they are owed to charity to make them more sympathetic).One failing with this film is that it isn't as funny as I hoped it would be; there are moments dotted around here and there that had me chuckling, but overall I expected it to be funnier (the film has a tendency to get a little sappy from time to time which does harm it slightly). Despite some seemingly clever plot turns towards the end, the film doesn't really offer many surprises and the whole thing is trotted out in a fairly safe and predictable manner.Still warts and all, Going In Style is still a decent enough film with 3 veteran actors showing the world that they've still got what it takes (even though they are now all octogenarians). The three leads don't do anything spectacular here and sure as hell don't do anything worthy of an Oscar, but they're all clearly having fun and at this point in their careers none of the 3 leads have anything to prove.Going In Style isn't a brilliant film by any means, but there is just about enough heart, chemistry and care given to make it worth at least a look.",Going in Style
34,myriamlenys,Not as good as it could be,6,14 March 2018,"The idea is pleasant enough, but the movie itself is overlong and drawn-out. There is a long scene concerning theft and robbery in a supermarket that makes about as much sense as a theology seminar in a waffle bakery, while the ending... Well, you might just as well leave your seat in order to buy some popcorn, it's not as if you'll be missing anything. I'm still giving the movie six stars because of the charming performances - its three protagonists are often a delight to watch - and because it has the courage to highlight an important social problem. In our Western societies, people can be robbed of their pensions or savings, while the various bankers and entrepreneurs who rob them go scot-free. Worse, the robber barons are often considered pillars of society, worthy of any kind of aid or subsidy, which means that the victims have the privilege of paying the perpetrators twice - once in their capacity as victims and once in their capacity as taxpayers. A nice variation on the same theme : the businessmen who move their enterprise to a far-distant foreign country, get hailed as apostles of international collaboration, and fill their pockets before sailing into the sunset on yachts the size of Gibraltar.The movie contains a story about a striking tattoo that might help identify a criminal. I thought you might want to hear a story from my own country, Belgium. (I never witnessed the events myself, but it was told to me by reliable people.) Once there was a more or less crooked man who fled to a Latin American country - let's say Brasil - in order to avoid alimony trouble with a considerable amount of (ex-)wives and lovers. Sadly his life of wine, women and song killed him off after only three or four months in the tropical heat. His son and son-in law travelled to Brasil in order to take care of funeral arrangements. To his surprise, the son discovered that there was some kind of weird triangle tattooed on the corpse's chest. Making enquiries with the tattoo artist, he discovered that the dead man had wanted to have a giant tattoo all over his chest. The design, which was pretty opulent (think Archangel Michael battling a dragon while supervised by three sirens, a football player and the Eye of God) had been suggested by a priest of a local religion. The tattoo was meant to make its wearer invisible.In other words, here was a man who wanted a giant, spectacular tattoo all over his chest, in hopes that people wouldn't notice or remember his presence...",Going in Style

36,rgkarim,Going Back To Traditional Style,7,7 April 2017,"The age of comedy has certainly changed over the years, transitioning from the classic slapstick to a simpler, straightforward approach that today's youth loves. Yet, every once in a while, the legends from the past return in an attempt to bring some whit back to the silver screen. Tonight, my friend and I head back into the trenches of the local theater to give some insight into Going in Style starring the legendary trio of Morgan Freeman, Alan Arkin, and Michael Caine. Let's get started!LIKES:  Classic comedy  Good chemistry between actors  Cute  Nicely tied together storySummary: If the intro didn't spoil it for you, Going in Style is true to its name, as the trio brings the classic comedy back into style. Fans of the slapstick of yore are going to bust a gut at this film as the timeless styles of the leads continue to shine bright. Caine and Freeman have comedic timing and delivery down, with clever lines craftily intertwined in the serious dialogue that put today's writing to shame. Arkin on the other hand is all about the banter and complaining, which for the most part is balanced and well-placed. The trio have great chemistry together, and sell that they are best friends who have faced the challenge called life. They sell the struggles and praise the joys, and do it with such class and minimizing the stupid, mindless banter famous today. And in addition to being funny, the lack of crude comedy also makes this movie cute. Watching older men trying to rob a bank, while also getting their lives in order makes for an adorable adventure as my friend commented. Of course, this reviewer likes a story to his comedy, and Going in Style gets this right too. It's a hardy story for most ages, and one that won't have the older audience members shaking their heads in shame. This may also surprise you, but there were a couple of twists that fooled me, which isn't easy in the comedy genre. DISLIKES:  Predictable  Depressing at times  Old jokes get a bit staleSummary: With a simple story as this, it's not surprising that much of the story is predictable. Given the theme of the movie, you should be able to predict most of the ending, and certainly can guess where things are going to go wrong. Therefore, the uniqueness of this movie takes a hit in the story department. And no surprise, the comedy is also predictable and therefore loses the comedy edge they wanted to deliverat least to me. While the trailers do promote the more fun atmosphere of the movie, don't let it fool you that it is all happiness and rainbows (that's the Smurfs!). Going in style emphasizes the end of life generation, highlighting the less than glorious problems of getting older. There are parts that brought me down as they emphasized the sadder qualities of life. Thank goodness for the consistent comedy, because otherwise this could have been a much harder movie to watch. Of all the comedy this movie has in its folds, they certainly stuck with the old theme of this movie. Positives, there are plenty of quips and class to the punches they throw. Bad news, the quips get older than the actors delivering them. How many insults about difficulties getting up can you make, or metaphors for being poor and not having a check. It's good political awareness (nice work there writers), but it would have been nice for a little more variety to work its way into the vaudeville. The VERDICT:Going in Style is one of the classier, wittier comedies to end up in the theater this year. Both this reviewer and his friend, enjoyed the trade of simplistic one-liners and innuendos for a less aggressive comedy style that shows the traditional style has not been lost quite yet. Despite the trade up though, the movie is still very predictable and simplistic enough to still be stuck in the mediocre territory. As much fun as I had in the movie, there isn't much to warrant it for a movie theater visit, unless you are a fan of the traditional comedy and looking for a fun group/date movie. My scores are:Comedy/Crime: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.0",Going in Style
37,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Going in Style,7,8 April 2017,"Zach Braff has directed three movies. They are Garden State, Wish I Was Here, and Going in Style. ""Style"" (my latest review) is the best out of all of them. It's not as complicated, it's more commercial, and it's not quite as pretentious. Oh and Braff isn't in front of the camera this time. Now does that make Going in Style a better film overall? Not necessarily. This is completely different fodder from what Zach has helmed in the past. ""Style"" as a spring comedy slash crime mantra, just wants to have a good time.Better than old timer foil like The Bucket List and Last Vegas, Going in Style has Braff channeling his inner Jon Turteltaub (minus the technological gadgets). There's the film score by Rob Simonsen that sounds like erratic spy music. There's also the fast cut editing and split screen shots detailing ""Style's"" pivotal bank robbery (and bank robbery planning). Lastly, there's the whole, we-get-it-you're-old plot element vested upon us. In jest, a lot of Going in Style feels like you're watching a comedic National Treasure complete with AARP interludes. Zach Braff casts three legendary actors (Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Alan Arkin) and with a breezily tone, makes them all seem likable.Distributed by Warner Bros. and shot around parts of Brooklyn, Queens, and summertime Manhattan, Going in Style is about three lifelong pals named Willie (Freeman), Joe (Caine), and Albert (Arkin). They are insolvent, over the age of 75, and have their pensions revoked after the company they worked for, becomes restructured. Their solution and inspiration: Pull off a bank heist of over a million dollars with the guys wearing Rat Pack masks and donning firearms with blanks (examples of the Rat Pack are Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, and Joey Bishop). Look for a test robbery featuring Freeman and Caine knocking off a lowly supermarket. Also, be on the lookout for a scene where the three senior citizens toke up on some potent ganja (you know, the urban definition for weed).All in all, ""Style"" despite a small twist, comes off as predictable, a little too happy happy, and altogether trivial. Yup, not much feels at stake. However, it's jolly, entertaining, and chuckled in a PG-13 sort of way. ""Style"" is a remake of a 1979 film saddled with the same title. I've never seen that George Burns vehicle and I may never see it (unless I decide to order the Blu-ray on Amazon). No matter. This new version of Going in Style probably has a ""style"" all its own anyway. Oh and I almost forgot, watch for famed actors Matt Dillon, Ann Margret, and Christopher Lloyd in small, supporting roles. They add to ""Style's"" lighthearted fun. Rating: 3 stars.",Going in Style
38,rannynm,Funniest Movie We've Seen All Year!,10,8 April 2017,"Out of all of the movies that I have seen this year, this movie is by far the funniest. Within five minutes, my stomach hurt because I was laughing so much. I love a comedic plot and Going In Style is exactly that - three older men try to rob a bank to obtain a better life. These lifelong friends, Willie, Al and Joe, are having personal struggles. Willie (Morgan Freeman) desperately needs a new kidney. Joe (Michael Caine) is losing his home. And, Al (Alan Arkin) is just pressured into robbing a bank. Joe thinks of making the idea a reality once their pensions are canceled. Inspired by a robbery the men witnessed, Willie, Joe and Al are optimistic they can steal their deserved pension money, but are going to need help. Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Willie is incredible. Given that Willie needs a new kidney to better his life, Freeman's despair is heart-wrenching and he connects with the audience in a unique way, because he remains hopeful that he will feel better in the near future. Michael Caine really suits the role of Joe whose fearless personality helps accelerate the success of the robbery. Alan Arkin plays Al who acts innocent at first, but once the robbery becomes a reality, you see his wild side emerge and it is quite hilarious. The costumes worn by Willie, Joe and Al are extremely entertaining. They wear masks that resemble famous people! In addition to this, the bank they plan to rob is very fancy. Seeing famous people walk into an elegant bank with guns and large bags is humorous to watch. My favorite part is when Joe and Willie are watching television and The Bachelorette comes on. This scene had me laughing the entire time because I am a such a Bachelorette fan. Seeing these older men discuss Kaitlyn Bristowe's final pick was unexpected, but gave me a good laugh. The message of this film is to chase after your dreams, no matter how old you are. If 70 year old men can rob a bank, then you can too. All humor aside, the film illustrates that nothing is impossible and you can better your life if you want to. Hands down, this film deserves 5 out of 5 stars. There are a multitude of jokes, action scenes and the motivation that these three men possess to reunite with their families and better their lives is so strong. It motivates me to jump over any obstacle in my way and complete any task I need to. I recommend this film to kids ages 13 to 18, because it leaves you with a smile on your face. Even though it is about robbing a bank, kids know to not replicate that, so I'm not concerned about them heading out to rob their neighborhood bank. There are a few shooting scenes, so please be mindful about who goes to see this film. Adults will love this film as well, because they can relate to the personal issues these men face. It has something for everyone and if you have never seen three older men rob a bank, you definitely should. By Samantha M., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",Going in Style
39,Kingslaay,This film has some style and charm,7,4 May 2017,I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. It was not one that exploited the old age as a source of material. It had a degree of realism and was humorous. Banks and some institutions can be unscrupulous in their dealings. Sadly innocent people have to pay and in this case three gents are left with nothing and decide they have nothing to lose so why not rob their own bank. We have seen so many bank robbery films in Hollywood over the decades and most are pretty good. However they all take familiar paths and involve young and capable robbers. In contrast we see elderly folk try and attempt this. We have some great performances from Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine who reasonably pull off a robbery and have solid alibis. It also had some deep moments with Morgan Freeman's character needing a kidney and the three men doing this so they can live with some dignity. It was somewhat realistic because it invited us to ponder old age and how such many of us could be in such a situation in a cold society. The comedy also flowed flawlessly and the film didn't have to try too hard to be funny. It had some feel good moments towards the end and would leave viewers with a positive experience. Definitely recommend it. 7.5/10,Going in Style

The camaraderie between Caine, Freeman and Arkin is indeed fun to watch and the conversations are sprinkled with umpteen bits of jocularity. The actors make fun of themselves and of each other.When the trio (who happen to be long-time employees of a steel firm, along with a whole bunch of others) are deprived of their pensions, they decide to rob the same bank (where they held their accounts for several years) that is now assisting the company in channeling funds to pay off debts.While logic and practicality take a back-seat, the buoyancy of the protagonists is what keeps the film afloat. The womenfolk in the film (daughters, grand-daughters, lady-friends) really don't have much to do other than smile and sympathize, as this film is more about fellowship and long-lasting solidarity between men.The planning bits are amusingly pleasurable. Arkin's one-liners are boisterous and hit the mark on most occasions. If one isn't expecting anything ground-breaking, then this film is bound to make you, at the very least, 'feel good'. The climax is the ideal cinematic cliché.Verdict: Good fun while it lasts; not much takeaway though!",Going in Style
42,leftbanker-1,A Failure on Many Levels,4,14 July 2017,"This movie plumbs new levels of mediocrity and facile answers to big questions. These three great actors deciding together to do such a bad movie is like some sort of suicide pact. Instead of robbing a bank the three should have executed the company officers responsible for outsourcing their entire company overseas. Instead, the movie took what are real problems facing an aging American public and turned it all into a ridiculous farce where the heroes drink champagne and eat pie in the end. And they fixed a broken father and one old fart found love. So it doesn't work as a heist movie (too stupid); it doesn't work as a comedy (not funny); and it definitely isn't social commentary. It's just terrible.",Going in Style
43,blott2319-1,Decent entertainment but nothing remarkable,7,10 October 2021,"If you've seen a trailer for Going in Style you pretty much know what you're getting into. Some people will find this kind of film to be too dull and derivative, but for me it was a cute little story. Sure, I wasn't surprised or overly impressed by anything in this story of some senior citizens deciding to rob a bank, but that doesn't mean it failed to make me chuckle and smile on occasion. The premise and overall direction that the story takes is ridiculous, but I thought they did an admirable job of making you care about the characters and their plight, so you could accept some logic issues. Some of the scenes are kind of stupid, particularly their idea of shoplifting some items in order to practice for their next crime, but it was just cheap attempts at humor. I was probably more forgiving of Going in Style because it has a great cast of older actors, and is a reasonably fun way to pass the time. It's not a great comedy film, and I'm sure many people won't enjoy it all that much, I just needed a light and silly comedy when I sat down to watch it and that's what it delivered.",Going in Style
44,maurice_yacowar,desperate seniors rob bank,5,16 April 2017,"This feel good fantasy comedy probably does more harm than good. As in Martin Brest's 1979 original (which starred George Burns, Art Carney and Lee Strasberg), here three desperate, down-at-the-heels seniors — Alan Arkin, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman — try to escape penury and their end-of-life humiliation by robbing a bank. Spoiler alert: Despite their age, incompetence, inexperience, they pull it off. In fact the happy ending really piles it on. Their heist nets over $2million, but the film doesn't stop with that good fortune. It rather constructs a tower of them.Willie saves his life by getting a kidney transplant (from longtime room-mate Albert. Albert has an affair with, then marries, the zaftig Annie (Ann-Margaret). Joe saves his home from dispossession, provides for his daughter and grand-daughter and also converts his delinquent ex-son-in-law to assume the obligations and pleasures of fatherhood. Completing the joy, the lads' steady waitress is tipped with a wad big enough to choke a rhino and lands a man at least to dance with. The other resurrected old-timer Milton (a shrunken Christopher Lloyd) is allowed to sail blissfully on in harmless dementia. Fun and games all round. Reality? Who cares. In the post-truth, alternative facts, world of Trumpery it's better to laugh at our daily tragedies than to try to amend them. Two flirtations with disaster turn into even more joy. What seems like Albert's funeral turns into his wedding. The cops' last chance to bust our heroic trio is thwarted when the little black girl recognizes Willie from his wristwatch — with a portrait of his grand-daughter — but with the wisdom of Solomon helps him beat the rap. At its blackest, this film is only a tease.Indeed, so much happiness, all those satisfying conclusions, ruin the film. Both versions are rooted in the serious predicament American seniors face, with increasing debility and dramatically diminishing health and financial support in the decaying American culture. American seniors have probably never faced such a bleak and hopeless situation as Trump's budget reductions are inflicting upon them. But after the initial plot situation the film leaves that compelling social problem to wallow in magical happy resolution. This film doesn't address the social situation in a serious way that would make it significant but slides away into fantasy. If the men go in style, the film goes without any substance. It provides no realistic means to address the social issue that is its raison d'etre. It does its audience and its culture a disservice by turning a national tragedy into a bunch of laughs and a resolution achieved by magic but not by any usable strategy. It prefers to numb the pain rather than to cure it. In fact, this film bears out Russian director Sergei Eisenstein's distinction between Russian and American films. American films, he observed some 80 years ago (!), give their heroes a happy ending through some unrealistic, magical twist of plot. Russian films provide a realistic demonstration of how to work to achieve that satisfaction. Poverty-stricken senior citizens in America can't hope to save themselves through crime. Unless, of course, they're in the White House. So what are they to do? And what might we do to honour our elderly (a principle articulated by the boys' heist-instructor)? Serious questions, never more pertinent and urgent than under Trump's regime. But this film laughs them away.",Going in Style

46,phubbs,Going in Style,6,20 August 2017,"I've noticed a few movies like this in recent years, you know, with a small tight-knit roster of aging A-list stars that might not be here for much longer or are simply getting too old. I know that sounds really horrible but we've all gotta face the truth about life. But its funny how these epic cast rosters only seem to happen when the stars become old, didn't see it too much back in the day. I guess that could be down to them wanting to be the only major star in their own vehicle when they were younger, hungry for fame. As they get older I guess they mellow out a bit. Just a theory.So this is another remake of a movie I have not seen or heard of but seems like a justified update I suppose. The plot centres on three old geezers played by Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Alan Arkin who are all made redundant. Not only that but they all lose their pensions due to their company being bought out and the restructuring within. So what do these old blokes do? Well they decide to rob the bank that is carrying out the restructuring of their pension funds.So you get the gist here, geriatric bank robbers equals hilarity...right? Well yes and no, its hardly a laugh riot that's for sure, but predictable and cliched? Most definitely. To start with things move slowly as we meet the three characters and get to know their lives a bit. This is of course required to make us care about these guys and see their situations but it all moves slowly (just like old people). Each character has a different problem that is there to pull on your heartstrings. Joe (Caine) lives with his daughter and granddaughter but due to losing his job and pension they could all be evicted. Willie (Freeman) is becoming very ill due to kidney failure but also cannot afford to visit his family. Albert is the only one without anything overly disastrous happening, he's just a relatively poor old man. So, old men good, bank evil. Got it? Good.So to prep for their outrageous felony the guys first try to shoplift from a grocery store. This is one of the only truly funny sequences in the movie showcasing stereotypical geriatric tomfoolery and slapstick. The guys don't have a clue what to do and end up shoving all manner of things down their pants, inside jacket pockets or where ever. The getaway on the mobility scooter tops it off perfectly...if again a little too cliche. Because of course they escape on a mobility scooter, they're old farts. A security officer chases after Albert but it doesn't last too long because Albert is...well old! 'this isn't an admission of guilt, I'm just tired'. The follow up with the store manager (Kenan Thompson of 'Kenan & Kel') is also quite amusing.After this disappointing test run they seek help from an actual criminal to help them plan their heist. Cue training montage of old men getting fit and learning the tricks to becoming a top bank robber. Eventually we actually get to the actual bank robbing (are all American banks this splendid looking?) and being a family film its all very gentle and soppy. Old Willie almost keels over from overheating in his mask but is helped by a little girl in a vomit- inducing 'aww' moment. But then things take a slightly darker turn when the bank manager pulls a gun and tries to shoot the old men, but misses. Albert then strides over to the manager firing his blanks at him. This all felt very out of place in my opinion, especially when Albert starts firing his gun at the manager whilst saying he's gonna die. I realise he's letting out his frustration on the manager because of their financial situations and whatnot but Jesus!Apparently the original movie has a more downbeat ending with the old guys getting caught, but this has been overturned here. In this heart-warming adventure the guys get away with it and give much of the money away to all their friends and family. Pretty stupid really, seeing all these people getting packages with huge wads of cash in them. I think most people would probably go to the police suspecting criminal activity, not wanting to get in trouble or dragged into anything.Like I've said this is a SLOW moving film, there are lots of typical family scenes with soppy dialog. You do get a good sense of each character for sure but all the while you sit there just wanting them to get on with it. Basically you're not really interested in all the lovey-dovey build up, you just wanna see these guys rob the bank. Its all about old age pensioners robbing a bank, that's amusing and that's all you wanna see. The rest is all very very safe, clean and formulaic; light-hearted being an understatement. So yeah its fine, but could of been much funnier I think.6/10",Going in Style

48,RforFilm,Don't judge Going in Style by the ages. It's charming and fun,7,19 April 2017,"Kids, treat the elderly well. It's often shown through cartoons that old people are either grandparents or busy playing chess with their friends. In actuality, they are going about their days like any other, trying to make sure that they carefully budget their savings and social security checks. Money is becoming a bigger issue for them in the wake of increased inflation. This is why I've been sure to keep a savings going so that I can meet my goal of doing nothing. Some believe it's the governments job to help out the elderly while some see it as a matter of personal responsibility. I'd say the answer lies somewhere in the middle.The elderly and money is the subject of Going in Style. It's a remake of a George Burns movie of the same name (which I haven't seen), but I'll assume that due to the way banking has changed after the recession and how private companies have worked with the government to play around with their funds, that this does something different. I'll admit that when watching this, I got a vibe of Grumpy Old Men if the two decided to robe banks. So is Going in Style entertaining?Three men have been lifelong friends and coworkers at a steel plant; Joe (played by Michael Caine), Willie (played by Morgan Freeman), and Albert (played by Alan Arkin). They seem to be content, but wish that money was not an issue. To make things harder, Joe wants to send his granddaughter Brooklyn (played by Joey King) to a better school and not lose his home to the bank. While talking to his banker, he is a witness to a bank robbery who manage to get away with a million. When it's announced that the steel mill was going to suspend pensions, this puts our three guys in turmoil. Joe decides to take his revenge on the bank (which happens to be working with the steel mill to remove the pensions) by robbing it. Though Willie and Albert are reluctant, they eventually agree to work together to get their money back. At firs they start small by going to a local store to shoplift a couple of items. That doesn't go well, so Willie gets help from a family member who is shady on how to execute a successful bank robbery. In the meantime, FBI agent Hamer (played by Matt Dillon) may be following them. Given some of the other movies focused on senior citizens like Last Vegas, I was expecting something safe and innocent. Instead, I was actually entertained by this bank-robbing story. It's no Heat, but it's engaging and I found myself invested in these characters. A lot of that has to do with both Michael Caine and his two buddies. They're experienced performers and know how to sell themselves in both comedies and dramas. Though both Michael Caine and Alan Arkin remain committed, I felt that Morgan Freeman was sleepwalking. He seems to be the only character without much of a personality.Going in Style, as I said reminded me of Grumpy Old Men so much, that I was convinced that if Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau were still alive, they would probably be in this movie. It doesn't push the boundaries of comedy, but the story makes up for it by continuing to keep the plot going after the robbery commences and managed to throw me off on how it was going to end. I like movies that keep me on my toes. If I had to pick a moment, it would be the grocery store shoplifting sequence as the highlight.I'll give this seven Frank Sinatra masks out of ten. Though it is gentle, Going in Style was both charming and fun. I think most audiences over fifty will enjoy this romp. Perhaps some young ones will like it too.

51,dave-mcclain,"""Going in Style"" is a fun, although unrealistic, senior citizen adventure and whether it improves on the original film is open for debate.",6,8 April 2017,"2017's geriatric crime comedy ""Going in Style"" (PG-13, 1:36) is a remake of the 1979 film of the same name. That one starred legendary comedian George Burns, whose seven-decade career spanned vaudeville, radio, TV and movies, Art Carney, who had even more acting credits than Burns, and who, like Burns, had also moved from mainly TV shows to mainly movies, and legendary theater founder, acting coach and actor in his own right, Lee Strasberg. Oh, and Burns and Carney had each won an Oscar and Strasberg had been nominated, all less than five years prior to appearing together on film. The remake stars Morgan Freeman, Sir Michael Caine and Alan Arkin, three actors with similarly prestigious, lengthy and diverse careers, and all three with Oscars to boot. It's also worth noting that the original was written and directed by Martin Brest, who had only directed a couple other films before ""Going in Style"", but went on to direct ""Beverly Hills Cop"", ""Midnight Run"" and ""Scent of a Woman"", while the remake's director, Zach Braff, started acting professionally in the late 1980s and directed a handful of films before 2017 (including 2004's cult favorite ""Garden State"" and 2014's well-received ""Wish I Was Here""), all seeming to signal an even brighter future ahead for the auteur who turned 42 years old the day before his movie was released. But does Braff's version of ""Going in Style"" help further his blossoming career? And is the movie a highlight or a footnote in the careers of its accomplished stars? ""Going in Style"" features three curmudgeonly septuagenarians who have been friends for decades, having worked together long enough to earn pensions from Wechsler Steel. In retirement, they see each other every day, playing Bocce in the park, hanging out at their local lodge, sharing meals, and watching TV together, to include shows like ""The Bachelorette"". It helps that Albert (Alan Arkin) and Willie (Morgan Freeman) share a house. Albert is a confirmed bachelor and has no interest in changing his status, in spite of the ongoing flirtations of sweet and sexy grocery store employee Annie (Ann-Margaret). Willie Skypes with his daughter and granddaughter, but can't visit them because, like his friends, he doesn't have much money – and he has a serious kidney problem (which he is keeping from his friends). Joe (Michael Caine) is struggling to pay his mortgage, but is providing a home to his divorced daughter and her tween daughter. Joe is a devoted grandfather to the precocious Brooklyn (Joey King), whose absentee father, Peter (Peter Serafinowicz) has about as much growing-up to do as his little girl.The money problems of the three best friends become practically insurmountable when their former company announces that it is moving all its operations out of the country – and taking its pension fund with it. Initially very angry at their former employers and very fearful about their financial futures, they decide to do something about their situation. Joe had recently been at his bank talking to a squirrelly and unsympathetic loan officer (Josh Pais) in a futile attempt to fend off foreclosure when the bank is robbed with impressive efficiency by three masked men using automatic weapons. After the pension bombshell, the three old gents find out that Joe's bank is managing Wechsler's finances and Joe suggests robbing that bank to recover their pensions. After some discussion, bickering and persuasion, the guys decide to warm up with a grocery store food heist which goes predictably and comically wrong. The grocery store manager (Keenan Thompson) decides to give them a break and not press charges.Joe, Willie and Albert decide that they need professional help of the criminal variety. Joe goes to his deadbeat former son-in-law (who manages a shady medical marijuana shop and whom Joe calls a ""lowlife character""), hoping that Peter can put them in touch with an even shadier (and smarter) element. Peter links up the wannabe bank robbers with a man named Jesus (John Ortiz) who agrees to teach, train and mentor the guys in exchange for 25% of the take, IF they can avoid tipping their hand to the authorities and actually pull off the robbery. But all this is just the movie's set-up. With a suspicious FBI agent named Hamer (Matt Dillon) seemingly on to the trio, whether they go through with their planned bank robbery (and/or steer clear of law enforcement) is far from the end of this story.""Going in Style"" is a fun, although unrealistic, senior citizen adventure and whether it improves on the original film is open for debate. I found the remake more solid and more enjoyable than the original, but the IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes ratings beg to differ. Director Braff and screenwriter Theodore Melfi (""St. Vincent"", ""Hidden Figures"") successfully update the 1979 version for the 21st century, make it a bit more realistic and give it a more satisfying conclusion, but allow for serious plot holes. The three stars are excellent in their roles, but some overacting from the supporting players (especially Pais) damage the overall effect. The first half of the movie isn't as funny or entertaining as it wants to be, but the latter part of the film mostly makes up for that. The remake doesn't do much for the careers of those in front of or behind the camera, but doesn't hurt them either. The movie is enjoyable, but unremarkable. ""B""",Going in Style

Directed by Zach Braff (Garden State), it is a mildly amusing, yet often predictable film that makes for an adequate time-passer.In New York City, three elderly lifelong friends Joe (Michael Caine), Willie (Morgan Freeman), and Al (Alan Arkin) each have to deal with severe financial difficulties after the bank ceases their pensions. Determined to pay off their debts and get even with the bank, the three of them conspire to pull off a heist which will result in them stealing more than $2.3 million.The film is generally lighthearted and isn't anywhere near as amusing as it tries to be, considering the cast and crew involved. Most of the characters are forgettable and their situations feel clichéd, which leave little impression on the viewer. Strangely enough, it is Christopher Lloyd, playing a senile acquaintance of the three friends, who stood out the most, due to his moments of eccentricity and non sequiturs. However, there's no denying the three lead actors have good chemistry and are believable as friends who have been through so much in their long lives. The heist itself is fairly decent and there are some surprises here and there, but it is by no means on par with other, better heist films such as Ocean's Eleven and Heat.I rate it 6/10",Going in Style

Zack Braff is a better director than actor in my books.

His mortgage payment has tripled due to some shady business practices by his bank and his pension payments aren't coming in when they're supposed to. He's not only responsible for himself; his daughter and his granddaughter Brooklyn (Joey King) have moved in to save money for Brooklyn's schooling. His banker treats him like an idiot and the conversation starts to escalate. They're interrupted by 3 masked bandits who rob the tellers in the bank. Joe offers his wallet but the robbers refuse, saying they're only there for the bank's money. When Joe tells him how much of a jerk the banker was, the thief takes his wallet as punishment. They exit quickly but Joe notices a distinct tattoo on one of the robbers. When he tries to tell Det. Hamer (Matt Dillon), he gets brushed off and told to go home.Joe's possible foreclosure isn't the only issue. His best friends Willie (Morgan Freeman) and Albert (Alan Arkin) are having a tough time. Willie needs life-saving surgery, he's not going to keel over tomorrow but his time is limited if a solution isn't reached. Joe and Willie have families to console and while Albert is facing similar money issues (they all worked at the same steel mill), his issue is loneliness. What he doesn't seem to get is that the solution is right in front of him. Annie (Ann-Margret) is the grandmother of a student of his and she's giving him all the signals. Money is still the key issue however and with the cancellation of their pensions, they are short on legitimate solutions. Joe considers how easily the thieves got away and the size of the payday they got away with. He comes up with the idea to rob the bank that screwed him over and to refund their defunct pensions with the proceeds.This review will be fairly short. This movie is driven completely by the performances by it's 3 lead actors. Caine, Freeman and Arkin are Hollywood legends for a reason. Their chemistry carries this movie and you believe in their friendship. The movie is a tad on the sentimental side but that specific tone helps put a nice light on how sweet and enduring their characters' bond is. The supporting performances are a little hit and miss (Matt Dillon, Josh Pais and poor Christopher Lloyd are all playing characters that are either painted as caricatures or played up for cheap laughs) but I actually really liked Ann Margret as Annie. Peter Serafanowicz gets a small amount of screen time but he does good work and his character actually went against type (he's Brooklyn's dad and instead of being a drunk or a abusive parent, he's just a flake who means well but can't get his life together). The movie also has a good message. The real dirt of the situation is largely avoided but they do get across the message of standing up for yourself against a corrupt system and how your life doesn't have to be done after you get past a certain age.On the flip side, this movie is intermittently funny but I felt it plays things way too safe. Minus the use of guns and some jokes about marijuana and sex, this is a largely G rated movie about bank robbers. Its very reminiscent of Last Vegas where nothing taboo comes up and risqué subjects are side-stepped for old people gags. Something seems off about that, I don't need every heist movie to be a hard R rated flick like the Town for example but this is movie is needlessly sappy. The actual heist doesn't seem plausible at all and the cops are painted as morons. I know this movie was going for the family demographic but they could have provided a deeper story or a movie that would have stuck with you if they had just taken a couple of chances instead.This movie is like a nice cup of hot chocolate. It will warm you up for a bit but you might be thirsty again an hour later. I laughed a little watching Going In Style and I was impressed by Caine, Freeman and Arkin. I wouldn't nominate this for any awards but this is a safe choice for what to see in the theatre right now.",Going in Style

They have fantastic chemistry and are the highlight of the film. They ARE the film.Going In Style is a remake of the old 1979 movie, yet the story still has relevance. You'll be entertained and walk out of the theater with a goofy grin on your face.Uplifting theme: Life-long friends Loyalty, family, friendship ""One can't get enough time."" – Joe (Michael Caine) ""Do you want to drift off into the sunset or go out with a bang?"" – Joe ""There's always another way."" – Murphy (Peter SerafinowiczThings I liked: Christopher Lloyd has a small role, but he does a great job and steals the scenes he's in. I don't like seeing him get so old, but it happens to all of us. We haven't seen Ann Margaret in a while. I think the first time I ever saw her in a movie was in Bye Bye Birdie. I thought she was mesmerizing. What incredible, long careers all of these actors have had. Pie! It's entertaining to see how they mastermind their big crime. Even funnier is watching them try to steal some groceries to get their feet wet in their new life of crime. Kids, don't try this! Have you noticed that Morgan Freeman has now been in 3 movies with the same theme that he's dying and now needs to do something crazy? Check out The Bucket List and Last Vegas. See? They're both fun flicks too.Things I didn't like: The movie suggests that all banks are evil and heartless; therefore, it's OK to commit crime. It is NOT OK to commit a crime. When people have nothing to lose, they do bad and/or illegal things. Having challenges in life still doesn't give us permission to break the law.

They seemed to be going for a kind of slapstick humor. Which would have been fine, if the movie was funny. It was one of those comedies that was not funny. A caper film without finesse, suspense, intrigue, a clever plot, or a funny line. What a monumental waste of a film. The director was totally out of his element. His lack of experience showed here, and he did not seem to be able to create any real engagement with the audience. He is a decent actor. He might consider staying away from directing, although Garden State was pretty good. A fluke perhaps? His one good film? I decided after an hour I had enough, and walked out.

In this case, the 3 principle players are a trio of Oscar winners -- Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Alan Arkin, and they are all very good in their roles, knocking off these characters, in this very traditional formula picture as if it was something that has NOT been done to death.

65,ginocox-206-336968,Amusing film marred by political commentary,6,21 July 2017,"""Going in Style"" is a remake of a 1979 film of the same title which I've either never seen or managed to entirely forget, so cannot make direct comparisons. Sometimes remakes are vast improvements on the originals. The filmmakers take what worked and rework what didn't, while making the story more relevant to a new audience. Viewed through contemporary eyes, I felt ""12"" was vastly superior to ""12 Angry Men,"" although many may label me a philistine for such a sacrilegious view. Other times, the filmmakers try to introduce elements that don't serve the story and miss the mark by a wide margin. ""Secret in Their Eyes"" was a remake of the Argentinian/Spanish film ""El secreto de sus ojos,"" but is generally considered inferior. In my opinion, part of the problem was that the filmmakers tried to make it more socially relevant with a diverse cast that didn't always suit the needs of the characters. GiS seems to reflect a bit of both characteristics. On the one hand, it is polished. The movie generally moves at a brisk pace with numerous subplots that are all tied together with neat bows by the denouement. On the other hand, the film periodically grinds to a halt to allow the filmmakers to make sophomoric political statements. These three larcenous geriatrics aren't villains. The true villains are greedy corporations that cheat their employees out of their pensions and the banks that engage in deceptive practices. On two separate occasions, all action is suspended while a character voices the film's theme: ""It is a culture's duty to take care of its elderly."" The subplots also carry messages about parental duties and health insurance. Ages ago, most movies and most moral questions were black and white. From 1930 to 1968, movies were required to conform to the Motion Picture Production Code, which set moral guidelines. Villains had to be identified before acts of villainy and such acts had to be punished. This seems frightfully moralistic and stifling to the creative process. Many of the greatest films of all time would have run afoul of the Code. And yet, it did reflect a dramatic imperative. At the conclusion of ""Tower Heist,"" a film with a similar plot, the protagonist must serve a prison sentence. It's a work of fiction. The writers could have ended it any way they wanted, but chose to send the protagonist to prison because it is more satisfying dramatically if victory is achieved at the cost of a personal sacrifice. GiS reflects a trend in many contemporary films of replacing good and evil by liberal and conservative. Lenin would probably have approved of the political and social views espoused in the film. Our ragtag band of geriatric Everymen deal drugs, smoke marijuana, steal vehicles, commit robberies, engage in extramarital sex, lie, destroy evidence, threaten people with guns and shoot blanks at a terrified man, but escape with impunity. Their acts are justified not by sacrifice or contrition, but by acts of charity in sharing their stolen loot. Some of the social/political content gives the story heart, but at other times, it supplants and detracts from the humor and drama and slows the pace. Production values are good. Editing is crisp. Camera movements are steady and assured, free of the distracting jiggly-cam shots that spoil so many movies. Performances are generally good, but not memorable. Freeman plays the same character he's played in ""R.E.D"" and other films. Arkin is the same character he played in ""Little Miss Sunshine."" Dillon is the character from ""Crash."" King is the same character she played in ""White House Down."" Lloyd and Pais are caricatures.",Going in Style

Three old-timers are planning to rob the bank, partly for revenge, partly for having something interesting to do before succumbing to senility. There's still fun to be had when you are beloved male movie star reaching his 60's or even more. There's a ton of age-appropriate roles on offer, such as tender grandpa, dirty grandpa, weird grandpa, or just some senior citizen who starts something unexpected and finds some new life thanks to this. Going in Style"" relies on tender grandpa and still capable senior citizen clichés to offer yet another joyful comedy-drama-lite – it deserves to be called a genre already – where you can watch some of the more beloved actors of our time crumbling away with style. This time, there's even more of them than I expected. We have two true stars (Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman), one well- known and loved actor who's not exactly a star (Alan Arkin) and even some has-beens, such as Christopher Lloyd – still offering some creepy variation on his schtick from Back to the Future"" – and Ann- Margret. So, there's gonna be as much geronto-fun as you can digest AND fun comic relief turn by SNL"" regular Kenan Thompson. This is the only thing in the movie that feels fresh and alive. Caine, Freeman and Arkin are screen legends capable of making every movie a little bit more interesting and enjoyable just by appearing in it. The sad part is, there is so little interesting or truly heart-felt going on that one is tempted to call in Going in Style"" a wasted opportunity. The characters, the relationships, the dialogue, the approach – all is so shallow and bland. But, of course, it was probably never aimed much higher than a pleasant if boring 96 minutes in the company of some of America's coolest senior citizens. Also, this must be one of the most unconvincing bank heist movies of all time. I get it, we are aiming for real here, but the way it plays out is just stupid. Was the writer even trying? It's certainly a wasted opportunity for director Zach Brach. He was a popular sitcom star in Scrubs"" (2001-10) who also surprised us by writing, directing and starring in Garden State"" (2004) – delightful little movie worthy to be called a modern classic. But 2010's have brought little to confirm he's still a player. And Going in Style"" seems more like drowning in saccharine-flavored mediocrity than anything to get excited about. Why do it at all, one might ask. Did he value hanging out with Freeman, Caine and Arkin more than trying to help his career? You can find a bunch of watchworthy movies and TV series about getting old, both artsy and mainstream – it's quite popular topic. With Going in Style"" being mainstream almost to a fault, I'd like to offer a recommendation of same sort – Men of a Certain Age"" or Grace and Frankie"", for example. Senior screen legends should also think about The Expendables"" style all-star-project, where they could also include Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, Al Pacino, Kevin Kline, Romany Malco, Sam Elliott, Mary Steenburgen or anybody else regularly willing to do this kind of nice but calorie-free entertainment. The all-star-approach would save us some time of watching most of them doing it separately. OR, they could choose to not endlessly repeat themselves and do non-mainstream movie about getting old for a change. Watch the trailer and save another 94 minutes. Almost all good bits are in there!",Going in Style
68,WalkdenEntertainment,These Old Guys Rule...,6,10 January 2019,"Based on the 1979 film, this remake of ""Going In Style"" tells the story of three senior men (played by Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman & Alan Arkin) who have been friends for many years. They also worked together at the same factory. Struggling to make ends meet week by week for themselves and their loved ones, life turns for worse when they discover their pension funds are gone.The three soon decide to make a stand and get even by robbing the very bank that has done wrong by them. The fun here is these men are old and none of them have a clue on how to rob a bank, hold a gun or drive a getaway car.Needless to say, this film doesn't have anything new in regards to the film plot: people are wronged and seek revenge or to take back what belongs to them. This type of film has been done many times but is rare to see it done with this type of cast and humour.One of the greatest things about Going in Style is the fact it's loaded with a talented (old school) cast. I'm not just talking about the three male leads- even the film's supporting cast is strong, including Ann Margaret & Christopher Lloyd. With a cast like this, I'm sure you'll agree when I say there are no complaints when it comes to the performances.Director Zach Braff (best known as JD from Scrubs) has directed another fun film which delivers many heart felt moments. The director really knew how the key actors were best to be used throughout the film. The quirky, well timed dialogue between leads was also something to be highly praised. I found myself enjoying many chuckles from start to finish just while listening to the characters basic conversations.Although this film has many older actors, I wish to encourage Finesse fans that this film isn't just aimed at an older generation. In fact, it almost comes off as a family film (well except for the 1 well timed F Bomb).While Going In Style isn't a film that will request repeat many viewings, I feel many people (including myself) will have some fun watching it. It is also a joy to see such a talented cast who proves they have the skill to provide strong performances while having a good cheeky time along the the way.6.6/10

Is this where RG-Bargy comes from? This review has digressed before it's begun. It could be age catching up to us. Or perhaps when Hollywood isn't using its imagination, our own minds must wander.I'm explaining few a things. A little bit of the plot as well. Surely that won't spoil it for you. Entirely. Based on the story 'Here on a Visit' by Edward Cannon, the 1979 version of Going in Style was the feature debut of 28-year-old director Martin Brest, who later achieved smash success with the likes of Beverly Hills Cop. It was a dry, low-key comedy featuring old vaudevillian George Burns, comedian Art Carney and method-acting legend Lee Strasberg, as a trio of retirees who elect to rob a bank with minimal planning, because, why not? It might be fun, if they get caught it's free room and board for a few years, and all they're doing otherwise is waiting for social security cheques and death.2017's Going in Style is the big-budget attempt at directorial career reboot for unfashionable funnyman Auteur Zack Braff, who has assembled his own septuagenarian comedy super-group in Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Alan Arkin. In keeping with the customary 'more is more' approach of remake culture, this Going in Style mines the financial crisis for deeper motivation for the old timers' robbery – Caine's house is being foreclosed on, and all three protagonists see their steelworkers' pension fund dissolved.Where Brest's film unfolded with pigeon-feeding scenes and wisecracks amid sighs, Braff gives us a loud machine gun robbery in the first five minutes, the bandit speechifying ""You're a casualty of a corrupt system that no longer serves the people!"" It is here Caine's character gets the inspiration to pull a bank job – his scheme to save his home by robbing the bank to pay the bank echoing last year's ""Hell or High Water"" by way of De Niro's ""Last Vegas,"" which also stars Morgan Freeman. And a bit of Ocean's Eleven, for when they do commit their heist they wear Rat Pack masks.Between the instigation and the execution, there are references to sore knees and musings on how many years they have left. There's a funny slapstick sequence where Caine, Freeman and Arkin test their criminal chops at a discount supermarket, only to knock over displays and make chase on a mobility scooter. Several episodes of Seinfeld are being referenced here, from old people stealing in 'The Bookstore' to George's Geriatric Bike Gang shenanigans in 'The Butter Shave'.Indeed, there's a cameo from Seinfeld regular Siobhan Fallon Hogan. There are cameos from Kenan Thompson as a wisecracking retail manager, and Matt Dillon, who smirks his way through his role as the cop, and Christopher Lloyd, embarrassingly hung out to dry in some cruel parody of dementia, and Peter Serafinowicz, in a perplexing role as the simpleton stoner deadbeat dad to Caine's grandchild.All these grab-bag references to comedy entertainment glory give Going in Style a soothing veneer but never cheer its hollow centre. A romantic subplot with Ann-Margret and Arkin simply reminds us that she's been playing love interest to aged cranks since 1993's Grumpy Old Men, while he's been moonlighting as dying granddad since 2006's Little Miss Sunshine. Braff, who in his Garden State days ambitiously aped techniques from Woody Allen, Pedro Almodóvar and Hal Ashby, is now content to visually experiment with a series of smooth but redundantly misbegotten split-screens.The economic wackiness of the plot would seem rote in most movies, and seems particularly insincere when the executive producer here is Trump's Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin. This is not even to mention that while the title is Going in Style, these good old boys don't actually 'go'. If the original was about thumbing one's nose at mortality but ultimately facing it, there's a happy ending this time, suggesting maybe you can pretend that the end will not come as long as you can fantasise of a payday.In theory, all the ingredients are there, three well loved actors, a bank heist and a great original material to work with. And yet, Going In Style fails to make any serious commentary on the worthy cause it purports to represent. Make no mistake, although the film wants you to root for these three wronged pensioners, this is no I, Daniel Blake. Despite having enough material to make a real social commentary about globalisation and capitalist greed, Braff misses a chance to make a valid point, and instead turns the whole thing into something, which will frankly leave a very few of you, well, cold. But don't argue about the fact that this is undeniably a very enjoyable watch with pitch-perfect acting from legendary actors.",Going in Style

The last survey found the average of such bank robberies netted about $4,500. Yet, we are told they left the bank with over two million dollars. Very likely they could not even carry two million dollars. Bills can be traced. They give a waitress a wad of $100s as a tip. Their criminal mentor would have told them about this. Writers could have had the 'friend' launder some of Arkin's need cash. Huge plot hole: Little girl is brought to a line-up and asked to study the faces except, at the robbery, she only pulled Freeman's mask over his chin. She never saw his or any other of their faces. Impossible for cops to have her doing a line-up. She did see Freeman's watch with a photo on his grand daughter on its face. Of course, she would have told the police about the watch and yet we are to believe that never happened. Shortly after the robbery the trio are major suspects and yet Arkin has stopped his home's foreclosure using thousands of the stolen cash. Their mentor would have warned them to lay low and not to spend large sums of the stolen cash for a while. The writers should have sent them to Las Vegas so they could claim they won some cash or ask their criminal mentor to launder some of it ASAP.

The alibis are so solid they cannot be broken. The FBI is pretty sure these 3-guys robbed the bank, but they cannot find enough evidence to charge them. This is all very clever and very enjoyable.

Unfortunately this film does not explore very far. In true American individualistic culture, the mentality seems to be that if the rich are going to steal and get away with it, then we may as well do the same. In some ways this is only a parody, but what is said always contains the feelings ideas & opinions of creators, at least to some degree. 
We need a spreading of wisdom. Does democracy mean that corporations and the extreme rich are free to keep all they have even when others go without the basics of food, clothing, water, medicine? Democracy when all humans on this planet has a voice, will call for a major overhaul: that the basic necessities of life be provided to all, not just to those who have $ in the bank.
It is a good start though. Hopefully it will get people thinking. Robbing banks is not the solution. People struggling while corporations post bigger & bigger profits is not the solution.

81,margulanabutrlov,Giong in Style Review,10,23 March 2019,"Unable to make mortgage repayments, senior citizen Joe (Caine) visits his bank and gets embroiled in a hold-up. When he loses his pension, it gives him the idea to pull off a heist, recruiting two of his old buddies as accomplices.
At one point during Going In Style, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Alan Arkin watch Dog Day Afternoon, another film about a dysfunctional bank heist. While it's never a good idea to quote a film that is much better than the one the audience is watching, the contrast is instructive. While Dog Day is genuine and off-beat, Going In Style couldn't be more on-beat, a slick, no-surprises studio comedy that doesn't make the most of its solid premise and star trio.
Based on a 1979 Martin Brest film (starring George Burns, Art Carney and Lee Strasberg), it's easy to see the appeal of a re-do. Three acting legends who can capture a silver audience similar to that for Last Vegas (Freeman's presence strengthens the connection) in a sprightly sounding tale that plays into our hatred of banks and fears around helping the aged is, on paper, a studio win. The conceit also wooed a surprising behind-the-scenes pedigree. It has been adapted by Hidden Figures director Ted Melfi, writer of the understated St. Vincent, and directed by Zach Braff, who as a filmmaker is best known as a documenter of late Gen X angst (Garden State, Wish I Was Here) rather than the twilight years of the Silent Generation. Sadly, the pair don't invest it with the indie freshness of their previous work.
The set-up is - suitably enough - slowly drawn and generic. Septuagenarians Joe (Caine), Willie (Freeman) and Al (Arkin) have worked together at a steel manufacturer for three decades. Joe, whose daughter and granddaughter live with him, is struggling to repay his mortgage; Willie never sees his family and is undergoing tests for kidney failure; Al is a miserablist sax player teaching untalented kids while fending off the advances of a grocery shop worker (Ann-Margret). Together they play boules, eat pie (metaphor alert!) and try to guess when they are going to peg it. When they are denied their pensions after their company plans to relocate its business to Vietnam, the financial noose tightens. So they decide to hold up the local bank that has absconded with their loot.
Reservoir Dogs played only with Mr Grey is enticing yet Going In Style never quite pulls the caper off. We get unfunny age-centric gags about not being able to get out of chairs, geriatric sex, mobility scooter chases, old folk taking drugs and codgers in the underworld: 'Are you 5-0?"" asks John Ortiz's ne'er do well. ""We're nearer 8-0,"" retorts Caine. A set-piece where the gang practise crime via shoplifting is broad and over-long. Braff gets a little bit more engaged when it comes to the planning of the heist and the aftermath of the robbery when the trio have to spin their alibi to Fed Matt Dillon actually has some zip. But overall his direction adds little in the way of zest or wit. And Rob Simonsen's 'comedy thriller' score is an early contender for most annoying soundtrack of the year.
Caine, Freeman and Arkin are always watchable but feel disengaged here. With the possible exception of Arkin, channelling his Little Miss Sunshine irascibility, Melfi doesn't give them anything approaching a character. There is the odd good moment - the guys heckling The Batchelorette rose ceremony is one of the film's few bits of real-life character - and it's hard to disagree with its 'Everyone deserves a piece of the pie' sentiment. But what Going In Style desperately needs is a twinkle. Sadly, it can't find one for love nor stolen money.",Going in Style

For a modern film, Going in Style is actually very funny, the three main actors prove that they still have what it takes to produce a great film. After being caught up in a bank robbery, Joe (Micheal Caine) enlists his two closet friends Willie and Albert to help in their own robbery, the events come about as all three of their pensions get cancelled, leaving a bitter taste in all their mouths, they feel cheated by society, a society they once helped to build, to enact their revenge on this corrupt society, yes they plan to be back robbers. In itself the bank robbery was quite ingenious, how they were able to expertly cover their tracks and fool the police and FBI was satisfying.The romance sub-plot was unneeded but nevertheless added something to the overall story, Alan Arkin's Albert gradually woos Ann-Margret's Annie, a romance angle that threads itself through the story, in the end as Albert strikes it rich, the couple marry.

Similarly, Freeman is a shadow of his former self and Arkin a completely pointless character addition to the silly storyline. The feeling I get is that they are entirely aware of the poor script and are totally deflated into portraying its general sense of resignation and absurdity.One pleasant surprise was to see the ever-sexy Ann-Margret in this film. I'm utterly gobsmacked to see how she, as a 76-year-old at the making of this film, is still so attractive! A beautiful lady...!The theme of this film is certainly not a new one.

88,trevor-82944,I'd Rather Not Get Old Anytime Soon,4,7 April 2017,"You are older than you ever were before. Now you are older than you ever were before. Now you are officially older than you ever were before. Day by day, minutes pass by, and we all fear the approaching retirement age, when we face unimaginable health problems to remind us of our vulnerability. We begin to question, ""Where did our lives go?""Going in Style explores the feeling of seniority when the past only looks like a presentation of lost opportunities. Although here, it seems like getting old means time to ignore authority and commit thievery. So nothing can possibly go wrong, right?Three old men drive director Zach Braff's buddy movie, all of them Academy Award winning actors. One of them, portrayed by Michael Caine (The Cider House Rules, Sleuth) lives with his daughter and granddaughter, which adds to the pressure of his overdrawn checking account. Another one of them, portrayed by Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby, The Shawshank Redemption), lives with his longtime roommate, and refuses to make public his desperation for a kidney transplant. The longtime roommate, portrayed by Alan Arkin (Argo, Little Miss Sunshine), has had it with his living as a music instructor, and fights the urge to start a romance with a convenience store clerk who can't stop flirting with him.All in all, these three senior citizens will waste no more time, and their leader (Caine) decides to rob a bank after experiencing a robbery first-hand. He understands his desire to stop living mundanely, and takes action to ensure a satisfying retirement.First they try to shoplift a convenience store, which is actually quite a hoot to watch. Alas, their first baby step fails pretty miserably. Some extra preplanning is needed by an experienced professional, who coincidentally happens to be a Mexican named Jesus. Yes, I know: ""Wow. A professional Mexican terrorist in New York City—exactly what our country could benefit from!"" Seriously, such a casting decision in light of recent events is morally irresponsible.Anyways, on they go into a month-long setup for the big day, a situation open to numerous narrative possibilities worth over four minutes of montage, even though it winds up doing just that. Too bad for us, as their plan deserves a much deeper exploration into the meticulous detail; but what we are shown still looks well thought out against the unkind legal system. While the police force's functionality may defy believability here and there, you'll overall buy into their wild adventure against the law.Then the mission's stakes continue to get higher as they don ""Rat Pack"" costumes at the official heist. Awesomeness lands in these three old men's endeavors of the little time they have left, especially when considering the individual conflicts each of them faces. Yet when the whole scene finally comes up, it does not last as long as desired.Thankfully though, the attempted bond between the three leads should guarantee an impact, both with one another and their outside families. I say ""attempted"" because none of the performances by any of the cast delivers any genuine sorrow for the quiet moments. All players here fall along the lines of poor, below average, or somewhere in the middle. Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future) gives the only good performance as the old loon who runs the men's elderly community, even though his dialogue suggests nothing beyond weak comic relief.You may by now see Going in Style as a mere Redbox rental worth a one-time watch, and only if you're a man over middle age seeking a unique perspective of growing old. Well I can certainly attest your assumption—this type of entertainment probably would work better if aired straight to TV.

After around twenty minutes, the plot becomes quickly deluded with Luke-warm silliness that weighs in about one or two rungs above fart jokes. The humor is contrived and not funny.Rather than explore the issues of aging more deeply (and yes, I'm well aware it was supposed to be a comedy), what we get is a buffoonish parade of supporting rolls around our central characters, from a bank manager who pees his pants to a variety of other morons not even worth mentioning.Veteran actors Cain, Freeman, Arkin, Margret and Lloyd are completely diminished by the constant childish antics more befitting of a long forgotten made for TV movie-of-the-week.If you still sleep with a teddy bear, you might like it.If not, you'll find it as I did: Infantile and painfully dumb.Completely forgettable.",Going in Style

It also helps that some of my favorite actors are in the film. This is an overall great film and very sound technically.For a comedy, the cinematography was surprising at how gripping it was in just the opening scene. The angles of the camera provided a glorious look into the bank that was far from boring. Director Zach Braff must have had the easiest job working with actors Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Alan Arkin, which allowed him to be so creative in his shot selection and editing choices because the acting was so great.

OAPs (Old Age Pensioners) Willie Davis (American actor Morgan Freeman - The Shawshank Redemption, Seven), Al Gardner (American actor Alan Arkin - Edward Scissorhands, Argo) and Joe Harding (English actor Michael Caine - The Italian Job, Get Carter) are all living unremarkable lives in New York, when one day they decide to spice things up a bit – by robbing a bank! Though none of them have ever done anything criminal in their lives before, all three pull off the heist, but no sooner do they make off with the loot than their age begins to catch up with themGarden State director (and Scrubs actor) Zach Braff helms this riotous remake of the beloved 1979 comedy. From Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Alan Arkin to American actor Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future films, The Addams Family films) as Milton a friend of Willie, Al and Joe and Swedish actress Ann-Margret (Viva Las Vegas, Any Given Sunday), the film is a rollcall of old-time stars. The script is by acclaimed St Vincent scriptwriter Theodore Melfi. Amongst the other actors / actresses in Going In Style include American actor Matt Dillon (There's Something About Mary, Crash) as FBI Special Agent Hamer, American actress Joey King (Independence Day: Resurgence, White House Down) as Brooklyn like as in the New York borough Brooklyn Joe's granddaughter, English actor Peter Serafinowicz (Guardians Of The Galaxy, Spy) as Murphy Brooklyn's dad, American actress Maria Dizzia (While We're Young, True Story) as Rachel Harding Joe's daughter and Brooklyn's mum, American actress Siobhan Fallon Hogan (Men In Black, The Negotiator) as Mitzi who works in a diner where Joe, Willie and Al are regulars, American actor John Ortiz (Ransom, American Gangster) as Jesus, American actor Kenan Thompson (US TV Series Kenan & Kel, Snakes On A Plane) as a guy who works in a mini market, American actress Katlyn Carlson as Stacey, American actor Josh Pais (Phone Booth, I Saw The Light) as Chuck Lofton who works in a bank, Melanie Nicholls- King (Canadian TV Series Rookie Blue, US TV Series The Wire) as Cary Sachs, Ashley Aufderheide (US TV Series Preacher, High School Lover) as Kanika, Jeremy Bobb (The Drop, US TV Series The Knick) as Donald Lewis, Jeremy Shinder as Ezra, Annabelle Chow as Lucy, Nancy Sun as Mandy, Seth Barrish (True Story, How We Fell In Love) as Dr. Helton, Marlon Perrier as FBI Agent Cooper, Richie Moriarty as Kyle Kitson and American actor Richard Zavaglia (Bird, Where Sleeping Dogs Lie) as Ed Howe.Overall Going In Style is a good really funny film filled with really funny moments / scenes, comedy, caper, tongue and cheek stuff, some swearing, some minor violence, friendship, family, togetherness, team work, chases on foot and in vehicles, some weird bizarre stuff, banks, robberies, a good mixture of different people and nationalities and other things throughout the film. So I will give Going In Style an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and I will say Going In Style is worth seeing if you like funny comedy films like War On Everyone, Why Him?, the Problem Child films, Mike And Dave Need Wedding Dates, the Bean films, the Johnny English films, the Austin Powers films, the Ted films amongst others. So if you get the chance to see Going In Style in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later.",Going in Style

Right now this movie sits at 6.6 which just shows you the younger generation has no style or respect for any elderly, great actors or not. This is a solid 8.5 movie. It wasn't perfect, but just watching Morgan Freeman, Alan Arkin, and Sir Michael Caine together in a movie was worth an 8.0 But I am from a different generation. With a different view of most things. The movie had issues, but I definitely turned a blind eye to them and just loved watching these three great men of Hollywood - when male actors WERE great - was a beautiful experience for me. I definitely recommend watching this movie because it is ENTERTAINING. Something Hollywood today seems to forget how to do they are so immersed in their political agenda. It's difficult finding new movies or shows that simply entertain today without preaching or spouting a political agenda.

99,svikasha,A Fitting and Funny Postcard to the Elderly Struggling Financially,6,25 August 2017,"Hollywood has produced a lot of heist comedies over the years. But few heist comedies have been made with older actors. ""Going in Style"" is one such film. The movie is a 2017 remake of the 1979 comedy that goes by the same name. The film stars Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Alan Arkin who take on the roles of a dynamic trio of retirees who become dead set on robbing a bank after their pensions are cancelled after 40 years of loyal service.While ""Going in Style"" does deliver a few laughs on the behalf of the elderly at the expense of society, there isn't much meat in the film to keep the viewer invested in the story. Each of the three characters has financial problems for different reasons. Morgan Freeman's character is affected by kidney disease. Michael Caine's character discovers that he and his family will be homeless within thirty days. After witnessing a bank robbery where the robber gets away with over one and a half million dollars, the three elderly gentlemen each decide to come together to rob a bank despite their inexperience. While this plot does offer lots of opportunity for comedy, the story is implausible and the film isn't all that funny despite the creative license that the film takes. Although the actors delivered a solid performance, ""Going in Style"" is a flawed film because of its weak plot and is only watchable if one is looking for a few predictable laughs.",Going in Style

It shows how desperate some may be at that age and although it might seem like everything is going wrong, it is good for us to keep a positive outlook on life at all times.With a budget of 25 million US dollars, it isn't surprising that the film follows the highest standard, including A-list actors like Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, but even though the film succeeded the story is quite basic, as is the humour.

114,justbusinessthebook,Reviews from across the spectrum of injustice,10,5 August 2017,"To understand how someone would rate a movie like this, one should know the history of the person writing the review. Bluntly, I am a guy in a now-15-year battle against the injustices perpetrated by partisans sponsored by partisans inside our financial institutions. I have a deep sense of loathing for all bankers and their eager employees. Yes, the lessons of my life are that the allegiances of partisan financiers with partisan lawyers makes the rampant injustices inside our societies prevalent. So, it is ironic that this movie popped up as first on the 'comedy' list options provided to me (at Google Play) on August 4, 2017. Seeking a fantasy respite from this world of increasingly greedy madness, I stumbled across a piece of art that fulfilled the role of art in modern society. Despite the irony that many bankers will dance in their condos as more money pours into their vaults because of 'escapism', movies like this can be appreciated, as long as they are not our ultimate escape. AW, but in our world, even the dissenter should have moments of respite from the harsh realities of this world of greed we are into. So, forget how the movie, in the end, gives some hypocrisy to those three old men who give us the fantasy of justice fomented through crime. All of this leads, as the title suggests, to three poor old men having the life of bankers, 'going in style', in the end. I gave it a 10 because, yes, it made me laugh, want to dance and even cry in parts. That is art and the art of comedy comes across in this movie. IF you are cynical about the role of greed in our nations, this is a movie that gives you fantasy escape. No, not all of it is 'credible in the real world', but neither is 'Star Wars' or those other fantasy flights that the movie art gives us. It is fiction. Nevertheless, it carries the theme of revenge against the unjust off so well with a good story line, good acting and just the right amount of suspense, comedy and anticipation that its 'weak moments', in the eyes of the most critical (whose best friends ARE probably 'bankers'), should be forgiven. By those seeking an hour and a half of good escape. For an hour and a half plus minutes, it was... and I just might end up buying the movie in the end, for a collection where I would pull it off the shelf when I need respite from the realities of our world of greed and injustice that I know we can change. Without the potential for violence, portrayed in this movie. So, I am glad I escaped with this. Now back to work trying to make a world of change.

Consider this though; where are these films for elderly actresses? There are countless movies featuring old established actors at the wrong end of life (Last Vegas etc) and doing something about it. The fabulous Ann-Margaret looks better at her age than any of the principal male leads so if looks were a factor that argument is defunct.

121,twogunrosie,Old Guys Rule!,9,11 April 2017,"Alan Arkin, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine have proved that they still got it where it counts. And it's movies like this that are going to make us miss them when they're gone. Their on-screen chemistry was perfect. They are amazing actors and together, the result is a movie that brings the fun back into the theater without ridiculous subplots, unnecessary hysterics, or insulting your intelligence. The performances were genuine, funny, heartfelt and eye opening.I added eye-opening because the story line isn't just about three guys robbing a bank for some reason the rest of us can't relate to. On the contrary, these three men feel trapped as we all do from time to time. They get angry and they do something about it. It's a situation we can all relate to in some way and it makes me wonder - if I was in their situation, I'd probably do the same thing.The story proceeds with natural humor, wit and sarcasm that will leave you in stitches during some scenes and rooting for justice alongside them in others.All that is needed to thoroughly enjoy this movie is a reasonable sense of humor and a reasonable sense of social justice.They only absurd performance was the ridiculous antics of the bank manager, however his five minutes just make the rest of the movie seem that much better.",Going in Style

Script - flat (written by 3rd rate TV writer?!?), POOR directing and just plain UNbelievable. So many important issues mentioned but only clichés offered for resolution. Doesn't anyone else think that a retired person with a mortgage is a sitting duck for pension implosion?!? Like duh!!",Going in Style
124,dbcint,Substance not necessary,7,27 April 2017,"The premise of Going in Style is that three lifelong friends – Willie (Morgan Freeman), Joe (Michael Caine), and Albert (Alan Arkin) suddenly find themselves in major financial trouble as the steel mill they worked at outsources its jobs to Vietnam and uses people's retirement funds to pay off their debtors. And who does the steel mill owe money to? The same bank that is foreclosing Joe's mortgage, and also refuses to pay the three friends their pension. In retaliation, our heroes decide to rob said bank, in a desperate attempt to get back the money they believe is theirs.To do this, they decide to enlist the help of a professional criminal, who teaches the three friends just how to pull off a heist like this. But in a lot of ways, time is not on our would-be robbers' side.The biggest problem with the plot is that the bank has actually done nothing wrong. I know first-hand that anyone – young or old – can have trouble understanding all the double-talk and technical terms that banks and other large organisations use, but when the bank manager (Matt Dillon) explains to Joe what's happened to his money and why his mortgage payments have tripled, it's clear that the bank has acted perfectly legally and within their own protocols. Moreover, it's heavily implied that Joe signed paperwork saying he understood what he was being told at the time he bought the mortgage, and he agreed to the terms therein. Whether or not he did agree or understand is up for debate, but if he didn't, he shouldn't have signed. Now, you'll note that I've used the word ""legally"" there. Please do not confuse ""legally"" for ""ethically"" or ""morally"". I am saying that the bank has acted within the law. The law may have bitten our protagonists on their keisters, but that does not give them a right to act outside the law in order to restore the situation to what they think is right. In actuality, I think it's the steel mill who's acted more unethically and royally screwed over the three friends, but there doesn't seem to be anything anyone can do about that, and I guess a bank heist is just a simpler sell.Speaking of, this is a movie that could pretty much be sold on star power and genre alone. A comedy starring Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Alan Arkin, and with what equates to a glorified cameo by Christopher Lloyd? That's it – I don't need to know any more. Freeman, Caine, and Lloyd are three of the greatest actors I've grown up watching, and while I'm not familiar with most of Arkin's work, his résumé is well respected and dates back to the '60s. All three leads give fun performances, but not necessarily their best performances. Just off-hand I can think of two better roles for Michael Caine (Alfred from The Dark Knight Trilogy and Victor Melling in Miss Congeniality) and three for Morgan Freeman (Red from The Shawshank Redemption, Carter Chambers from The Bucket List, and God from Bruce Almighty), but I don't feel like this movie really needed their best performances. The whole movie has an air of ""let's just have fun"", and the show is damn near stolen by Christopher Lloyd anyway – along with a hilarious few scenes from Jeremy Shinder as a music student of Albert's.Most of the laughs come from seeing the three friends doing things that are utterly ridiculous for men of their age, and in some cases, would be ridiculous for anyone. The entire scene where the three practice their robbery skills on a local supermarket is filled with incompetence from all involved, but by the time Joe makes it halfway down the street with Willie in a shopper hopper, throwing flour at the pursuing security guard, you'll be grinning so much you won't care. That incompetence seems to run through the whole film, really. That security guard should have caught the three men before they even left the store (as a supermarket employee, I know for a fact there are protocols in place for that kind of situation), the supermarket's manager should have trespassed the lot of them, and the FBI is portrayed as being completely useless. Why the FBI is even brought in to deal with a bank robbery is beyond me – isn't that the kind of thing the local police should be handling? Then there's the bank manager, who spends one scene acting like a petulant child, which had the effect of overshadowing any good he'd done in previous scenes. If he'd had toys and a cot, he'd have thrown them out of it and would be sitting there crying for no good reason. I'm not a parent, so I can't say at what age someone should be able to stop getting away with such behaviour, but I'd certainly imagine it'd be long before he reaches his mid-40s. Despite some story and character flaws, Going in Style is a fun comedy that isn't trying to be anything particularly extraordinary. It works, based on the talent of the leads and a couple of supporting characters, and features enough laughs to ensure it will be remembered fondly come year's end.For my full review of this and other movies, visit my website at theblogfather.co.nz",Going in Style

While sometimes feeling cheesy, they are still done very well. Also the general idea of the film is quite funny.The negatives of this movie mainly revolve around the fact that there is nothing you haven't seen before in these types of movies. Also I don't believe the script brings out the maximum amounts of laughs that you could in this movie. The Bucket List and Last Vegas already made the jokes about old people being old and seemed like the go to joke in this movie.Overall, I didn't mind this movie, it was a fun watch.

There are three leads, all get cut off from the pension, so they decide to rob and bank, and they do. That's it.There are some backstories but nothing much serious. I guess the three leads, acting powerhouses as they are must not even broken a sweat filing this one. It is like a quick buck for them while working on some other project. When you are Caine and Freeman, nothing really is that hard, but this was exceptionally easy. No doubt the movie tanked and that was not because of the acting. That was spot on, not much was demanded from them. The script was fairly straightforward and borderline sloppy. Every movie has a purpose, like Fight club we saw just a few days back was a statement about consumerism and capitalism. This one has nothing of that sort.

136,Lleuq75,'Going in Style': Review,7,5 April 2017,"Joyful, hilarious, touching, exciting. ""Going in Style"" fits in all these categories, proving how age does not – and should not – deprive actors of comedic spirit. Michael Cane ('Joe'), Morgan Freeman ('Willie'), and Alan Arkin ('Al') give such good performances to the point that moments of lack of subtlety – from both the script and the direction – are minimized instead of forgiven. It is a hell of a good time from beginning to end.Down on their luck, the three old friends struggle to simply get through the day is becoming more unbearable each day. 'Joe' is under the pressure of bank eviction notices, 'Willie' has to overcome the distance from the family, and 'Al', well, could not care less as long as he is not alone. Alan Arkin, by the way, steals every scene – ""Little Miss Sunshine"" vibes.Their situation reaches its breaking point when their pensions are frozen. The three leads decide to rob their mutual bank and this part of the plot is what defines this movie for what it is. On the one hand, it plays up, to the maximum level, all the possible jokes and funny moments applicable to the circumstance – and the payoff includes a supermarket scene that I will not forget so soon. Another way it works is with the sneaky and twisty nature of the bank robbery operation – orchestrated with the help of 'Jesus' (John Ortiz). These do not just make sense, but they are truly clever. The part where it comes across as not as bright is in its efforts of justifying the leads actions. Of course, situations like this can and do very well happen, and are genuine injustices. Michael Cane sells that emotion with a few dramatic scenes involving his granddaughter in the film 'Brooklyn', played by Joey King. It is, however, in dealing with the circumstances of the robbery and the nature of such a situation that it falls short. Again, this is does not get in the way of it being a good and fully enjoyable film; it only keeps it from having that extra level of much appreciated sophistication. Ultimately, ""Going in Style"" does what it came to theaters to do: get constant, big, and loud laughs from the audience. It provides spectators with incredible 90 or so minutes of good fun at the movies. Despite hilarious supporting performances by Christopher Lloyd as 'Milton' and Ann-Margaret as 'Annie', the three Oscar winners leads carry this film with such class and wit that it makes it really hard not to enjoy the trip to the theater.7.5/10",Going in Style

140,LeoAlexson,Zach Braff's third film,8,6 April 2017,"Personally, I really like the works of Zach Braff, I fell in love with him in the series ""Scrubs"", which, thanks to the actor's play of Braff, delighted the fans for many years. Later I became interested in his first feature film ""Garden State"", which showed an unusual director's style of Braff. Then, after many years, the second film ""Wish i Was Here"" appeared, in which the matured director shared with the audience his experiences about the upbringing of children and death. Before watching ""Going in Style"" i found out that the film is a remake of the same picture released in 1979, this prompted me first to see it. Let's move on to the film itself.Actors Actors on the main roles, Braff took the first magnitude: Morgan Freeman, Michael Kane, Alan Arkin. Each of the actors is already a professional in their field, so they played at their good level: convincingly and vigorously. This film is the sixth joint work of Morgan Freeman and Michael Kane after the trilogy of Christopher Nolan about Batman and the ""Now You See Me"" dialog. Not a bad role was the young actress Joey King, who played the granddaughter of the character Michael Caine. I think that the actress will have many good and interesting roles in the future. Also pleased with the appearance of Christopher Lloyd, who was remembered by the majority for the role of Dr. Emmett Brown in the trilogy ""Back to the Future"".Story As I wrote earlier, before watching this film, I already looked at the version of 1979. When I went to the film, I assumed that I would see the story one by one, only with the eyes of another director. But, as it turned out, the film's writers foresaw this and pleasantly surprised me by changing the plot in key places. Both films, the 1979 film and the Braff movie are based on the work of Edward Cannon.Cinematography Separately, I would like to note the excellent and beautiful camera-work of Rodney Charters, which positively influenced the film and created for him a memorable style.The Result Although the film is not based on the original script of Zach Braff, his style is still very clearly traced in the picture. I believe that under the leadership of Braff, the film turned out to be much more energetic and cheerful compared to the previous interpretation of the work of Edward Cannon. Remained pleasantly surprised and pleased of film. I look forward to the next product of Braff.9 out of 10",Going in Style

Great Acting!,8,11 July 2017,"**Contains Minor Spoilers (if id even call it that), No Ending and No Direct Scene or Climax Description** ~Wanted to play it safe, avoid getting blacklisted while not ruining it for you~This movie was great again! Morgan Freeman is one of my top three favourite actors and has been since I first seen him in the Shawshank Redemption, (still the best, and most favourite movie of all time), with my grandpa in the mid 90's, I'm 26 now. Along with Michael Caine and Alan Arkin, you get the triple threat for any audience. They played their roles so well. I find that the better actors you draft in movies the better outcome and reviews it will get from media critics, because they can connect with the viewers in a way that no one else can really do. They almost make you feel the emotion, think how they think, feel how they feel, see and hear what they do. You become so immersed in the movie that even if it happened to lack a good story behind it, they play it so well, that it makes to be great one. In this movie it was no different as to how well the acting quality was, just magnificent.... And Funny. Like who thinks of a story about 3 old timers, (Senior Citizens to be politically correct), would ever plot to rob a bank? Like its so out of the box your already laughing at the idea before you even see the film. The movie was well scripted I found in it dropping lines just at the right time, the right way. The story had just enough in it to make it very interesting and immersive. From the comedy to how they plan to pull off the heist and the training it takes to get them prepared, has you holding your mouth to avoid spilling out the popcorn. It had wit and it had comedy. It also had empathy and sadness, along with fear and uncertainty. I felt the story was well thought of and planned out, not to skip too many details or important plot aspects along the way. The gritty punch lines and intellectually thought of jokes made me laugh at half of them, or more. The scene in the grocery store was absolutely hilarious and the conversation our main characters have with the store manager had my abdomen sore. The things they do while in the grocery store actually make you contemplate the type of society the movie was involved with. The only con I have is that I thought the movie could have been a little bit longer. Maybe show a little bit more of how they lived life after they pass the climax descent of the movie. I can never get enough of the movies with good actors, it always feels there is just not enough screen time. Overall I thought this movie was awesome. Coming from a self-made story line and scripting, they nailed it. If you enjoyed the Bucket List, I highly recommend you watch this film. You WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!! It doesn't have the intense sad emotions involved with the Bucket List as its a comedy, but it has the same witty personalities that our senior citizens shared with each other in the Bucket List. Overall I give this movie an 8/10. Witty, fun, creative, involving, inspirational (please don't attempt what they do), immersive, and just, well directed. Its one of those movies that doesn't compensate for bad acting and scripting with big explosions and expensive toys, but the complete opposite. I highly encourage you give it a watch.

I'd like to see more movies like this, than the stupid standard comedy from Hollywood. I recommend everyone to see this film and have great two hours. A quick summary: perfect chosen actor,s a bit predictable, but i liked it anyway, jokes,jokes,jokes... GO watch this film !",Going in Style

165,iasowinsdunmire,I've seen it twice,9,22 April 2017,Rotten Tomatoes website site says they were playing it safe on this one! I don't think so. I've seen it twice. I missed stuff the first time. It's good. Pay attention! There's a moral there somewhere. And it's funny! I loved it and I think you'll really like it. I will probably see it at least one more time!,Going in Style
166,vulcanojacrispy,An Acceptable Movie To Kill Time And Laugh With,7,8 June 2018,"I saw this about a year back with my family. The plot wasn't hard to follow, a lot of the shots were good, and aside from the weird joke about Morgan Freeman smoking a joint, which wasn't really too bad, it was a well-flowing story the whole way through. I felt that our money was well-spent and, if you ever find this on DVD somewhere, even if it's at the bottom of the bin, go for it. I don't know why this has a 6.6/10 of ten currently.",Going in Style
167,emilinesmith-26326,Absolutely loved it,9,13 July 2017,"This movie is absolutely entertaining, and might be the best of this year. The acting is absolutely superb. You want to be part of their friend group, and it definitely feels as if they have been friends forever. It made me miss my grandpa. It also made me be upset with our neoliberalist society for not taking care of our elders.",Going in Style

Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Alan Arkin are perfect for these roles it truly does feel like they have been friends for a long time and their all amazingly funny.",Going in Style

172,BaileyPumfleet,"A fun, enjoyable film",8,24 July 2018,"Going In Style was a film that stood out for me because of the enjoyable atmosphere within the film created by the three protagonists that face problems in life but retain their positive attitudes and sense of humour throughout.The story line plays really well throughout the film, with comedy elements placed throughout. The positive spirit of the film maintains a bright atmosphere all the way through the film, and then finishes the story on a happy ending.",Going in Style

Secondly, it ridicules the predatory practices of big banks in the United States that contributed the most to the Great Recession of 2008 and yet hardly any executives at the banks were charged for putting their customers at risk.",Going in Style

I don't ask much from movies but I do some a couple of check boxes and this movie ticks all the boxes. 10 for 10, hands down! It's has heart, humour (it's spelt this way where I'm from !) and a true realism that has enough fantasy to be believable. I was not bored for even a minute. I actually bought the movie and have to-date watch it four times, enjoying every time. Each viewing has enabled me to pick more nuances and subtle humour (yes, it really is spelt this way!) Kudos to everyone behind this story, thank you to all for providing me with 90 minutes of wonderful fun.",Going in Style
