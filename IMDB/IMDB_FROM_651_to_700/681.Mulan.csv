0,TheLittleSongbird,"Loyalty, bravery and truth",6,27 January 2021,"Saw 2020's 'Mulan' as a massive Disney fan. Although their recent live action offerings are very mixed and none are as good as the originals, many of their animated films are fine examples of how to do animation right. Looking at the title, the advertising and that seeing it was made by Disney, it is very easy to think that this is another one of the live action remakes and it is easy why it has been critiqued as one. Part of me was really psyched being somebody who loves the 1998 film, but also worried when seeing the hate for the film and for the lead actress.When seeing 'Mulan', it didn't actually strike me as a live action remake and doesn't have an awful lot of Disney in sight. Other than the title and references to the score of the 1998 film embedded in this one. Instead to me it came over as more another version of the character and her story, and one more serious and less family friendly, so directly comparing the two films didn't strike me as right. While the disappointment that is expressed is understandable, as there are big flaws to be found and it definitely does not have the same amount of charm, heart and thrills as the 1998 film, to me 'Mulan' was not that bad and was not deserving of the extreme backlash before it was even released. Seeing as Yifei Liu's personal views had/have nothing to do with Disney or the film crew.'Mulan' is not perfect. Do agree with those that say that a lot of the dialogue is pretty bad, with a tendency to sound stilted, especially in the cringe-worthy and very out of place attempts at sporadic humour with the troops, and go too heavy on emphasising the characters' values. Loyal, brave and true agreed did not need to be emphasised so much, the point was made quite quickly. There are things in the plot that sounded oddly intriguing on paper, but done too little with. Especially with the phoenix, which doesn't really add anything.Both Xianniang and Bori Khan felt like underdeveloped characters. The former comes off better as she is suitably mysterious and alluring, but her motives are pretty confused later on (with it being not clear what side she was on), she is pretty much a come and go plot device and her final scene felt very rushed. Bori Khan has an intimidating look but is underused and his motivation is pretty much the only thing that is learnt about him. Didn't like how easily defeated he was and how clumsy the scene looked. In general the characters could have done with more depth, Mulan and Zhou are the ones that come closest, and the film could have done with more soul.However, 'Mulan' does look great, especially striking in the truly exquisite historical visuals and the at its best majestic scenery. There is a lot of colour and atmosphere in the photography, which was clearly inspired by the likes of Zhang Yimou, and the costumes do catch the eye. The CGI didn't seem too excessive and didn't look jarringly cheap either. Harry Gregson-Williams' score is stirring and also has a sumptuous emotional core, also enjoyed hearing references to the music from the 1998 film. Niki Caro on the most part directs with confidence.Personally really was impressed by the beautifully choreographed and dynamically photographed action. When it needed to be tense it was, when it needed to be particularly athletic it was and when it needed to excite it did. Especially the big battle and the avalanche. It was easy to feel the strength, pain and perseverance needed to get through all that training, only the final showdown came over as ridiculous. The story was not perfect but it engaged enough, intrigued with the cultural aspects and inspired thanks to Mulan still being a strong character (though she doesn't grow as much or go on a character journey as much as the animated Mulan, if to briefly compare). Although the father-daughter reunion was more emotionally powerful previously, it is still quite moving in a subtle way here.Moreover, the acting wasn't bad at all to me. Liu is a confident lead, bringing authority and vulnerability to Mulan that was ideal for this ideal heroine. Donnie Yen and Jet Li are strong authority figures and Jason Scott Lee does inject some menace into his underdeveloped role. Tzi Ma's performance is very telling in its nuance, more than once not even saying a word. Li Gong looks wonderful in the film and is both deceptively alluring and mysterious, despite the character herself is not meaty Gong's acting is quite complex.In conclusion, prepared myself to hate it but quite liked it while finding it very flawed. 6/10",Mulan
1,SnoopyStyle,a mixed bag,6,11 September 2020,"In medieval China, Mulan (Yifei Liu) grew up as a rambunctious daughter with vast reserves of qi. Her father is secretly proud but her mother is concerned with her marriage potential. In the north along the silk road, Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) leads the Rouran warriors on a revenge mission for his late father with the help of the witch Xianniang (Gong Li) who uses her qi for evil. She is able to shapeshift and convinces the Emperor of China to conscript one male from each family. Mulan's father prepares to join the Army despite his old injuries. Mulan steals his armor and takes his place. She pretends to be a man while training under Commander Tung (Donnie Yen).This is a live action remake of the 1998 animated movie. There are choices being made that I understand but about which I'm uncertain. First and foremost, it's the lost of Mushu. While I completely understand the ridiculous problem of Mushu, this version is missing the comedy that Eddie Murphy delivered in the animated version. Somehow, Mulan needs a traveling companion to give comedic relief. It can't be a ghost due to government dictates. My only possible solution is a horse with an inner voice. That may be controversial but the movie needs comedy badly. Another issue is the use of qi which struck me as bringing Star Wars Force into Mulan. I am uncertain with this choice. I'm also confused with Xianniang's motivations. I don't understand her pushing the Emperor into instituting the draft. I don't understand her character during much of the third act. I don't understand her ultimate goals and her actions in driving the story. There are some bad action premise like when the soldiers turtled to hide from the attacking birds. I don't understand that they would be huddling together to give the trebuchet perfect targets. Also, trebuchets are not that accurate. Quite frankly, they really only need to be pinned down by arrow barrages. Mulan should be at the top of the mountain after chasing the mounted soldiers and confronting Xianniang. That way she would be in a position to start the avalanche by pushing a boulder down the mountain. Time and time again, the action scenes feel wrongly constructed like having too many cooks in the kitchen. This movie has various issues but non of them are deal-breakers.",Mulan
2,Prismark10,Mulan,4,8 September 2020,"Mulan is a dull thud of a live action remake that strips away a lot of subtext that the animated version had. All done so Disney could appease the Chinese censors.Mulan (Liu Yifei) is the daughter of an old soldier. Ever since she was a child, she had combat skills. Now instead of being married off. Mulan dresses as a boy and goes to fight in her father's place as the Emperor is being threatened by rebel Böri Khan.Mulan at first trains with her unit, they are a varied bunch of misfits. She smells as she is reluctant to bath with the others as it will give her identity away.It is colourful and there are some good battle sequences. It is also too bland and serious. Only the scenes with Xianniang. A warrior with witch like powers who is aiding Khan does the film hint at some homo eoticism as well as debating the role of women in the military.It is a very choppy and stiff story. Mulan goes from being an outcast when she reveals her sex to suddenly leading the army unit to defend the Emperor. At times it looked like I was watching Kung Fu Panda without the fun.",Mulan
3,nogodnomasters,Chi is for warriors,7,13 September 2020,"This is my first exposure to Mulan. I have not seen the animation or knew the tale. I loved Yifei Liu is the title role. The embraces loyalty, bravery, truth, and family honor. It was slow at times and sounded dubbed. I liked the fighting scenes and it is the few places where I tolerate the anti-gravity aspect.",Mulan
4,kosmasp,Strong independent... message?,6,27 December 2020,"Some would argue that the message is not the problem, but the delivery. Whatever side of the argument you are at, it is nice to see a strong main performance. But the problem is more of how this is utilized. You got this strong female presence and story, but it is riddled with cliches. Now you may argue that often times you'll have that with male characters too. True and if I see that, I'll point it out there too.So while it is nice especially for girls to see this and have someone to look up to, the Disney animated classic may be a better movie overall. I can't attest to that 100% though, since I haven't seen that in a while. The predictable story here, which has nothing to do with the previous movie/effort, might take a bit of fun away. The fact this tries hard to be politically correct, but fails so often does not give it any bonus points either. A lot of missed opportunities later, you have quite the epic movie (with nice if repeptetive choreography) ... there are worse movies to watch out there ... there are better ones too! Especially with the talent at hand. I can't talk about the beautiful lead, but I do know Jet Li and Donny Yen have quite a few marvelous movies you can watch ... and other cast members too of course - like Mulans father ... but let's not dwell on that. Just be aware of the flaws this has and either relish in its beauties (mostly visual ones) or leave it be",Mulan
5,classicsoncall,"""Am I loyal, brave and true?""",7,23 February 2021,"I have not seen the animated version of ""Mulan"", so I can't offer a comparison or contrast of the two. I did like this version, though stories like this tend to be somewhat formulaic. The cinematography and historical setting were wonderfully done, and the character of Mulan (Yifei Liu) is the type of hero that can serve as a credible role model for young girls and boys as well. The concept of a woman disguising herself as a male in order to perform heroic duties was a theme that was also explored in the fifth season of ""Hell on Wheels"", so it's not an entirely original idea. The protagonist in that series was also Chinese as well. One of the things thing I thought was handled a little awkwardly in this story was the character of the mystical witch Xianniang (Li Gong), who's early presence in the picture had her siding with the invaders led by Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee). As the story progressed, she began to favor Mulan and wound up helping her to face Khan and his warriors, though there was no specific motivation offered for making that switch other than her own history of bias in her upbringing. The virtues at the heart of the story speak of loyalty, bravery and truth along with devotion to family, so in that regard, Mulan's thoughts and actions were all implemented with those considerations in mind.",Mulan
6,jboothmillard,Mulan,6,11 April 2021,"The trailer for this live-action remake of the Disney animated movie looked pretty good, and then it was getting some attention during Awards Season, so I was always going to watch it, directed by Niki Caro (Whale Rider). Basically, in ancient imperial China, Zhou (Dante's Peak's Tzi Ma) and Li (Rosalind Chao) hope that one day their daughter Mulan (Yifei Liu) will be wed to a good husband, but they are disappointed as she is more interested in being adventurous and active. Mulan is arranged to meet with a Matchmaker (Cheng Pei-pei) to demonstrate her fitness as a future wife. But while pouring tea, Mulan's younger sister (Xana Tang) is scared by a spider, causing a mishap, leading the matchmaker to call Mulan a disgrace in front of her family. In the north, an imperial outpost is invaded by Rouran warriors, under the leadership of warrior Böri Khan (Jason Scott Lee). They are assisted by the witch Xian Lang (Gong Li), who uses her magic to pose as a surviving soldier and report the attack to the Emperor of China (Jet Li). The Emperor then issues messages ordering every family to contribute one man to fight in the army against Khan's forces. Imperial soldiers arrive in Mulan's village to enlist recruits and Zhou is forced to pledge his service as he has no sons. But Mulan realises that her father has no choice of survival, due to his bad leg. She decides to flee with his armour, horse, and sword, posing as a man to join in his place. Mulan arrives at the training camp, which is run by Commander Tung (Donnie Yen), an old comrade of Zhou. Alongside dozens of other inexperienced recruits, going by the name of ""Hua Jun"", she ultimately becomes a trained soldier under his tutelage, trying to avoid her true identity being exposed. Khan's army continues to advance, forcing Tung to end training early and send his battalion to fight. Mulan chases some troops on her own, but is confronted by Xian Lang, who mocks her for pretending to be a man. While Mulan and Xian Lang fight on swampy ground, the Rourans begin attacking her fellow troops with a trebuchet. After the witch assumes she has killed Mulan with a sharp weapon and flying away, Mulan's chest was protected by her armour, which she removes. Riding back into battle without her male disguise, Mulan discarded helmets and her archery skills to cause a diversion. She manoeuvres the trebuchet into firing on a snowy mountain, triggering an avalanche and burying the Rourans. After rescuing fellow soldier Chen Honghui (Yoson An), and no longer able to hide her true gender, Mulan is spared from being killed, following her bravery. She is expelled from the army and begins her return home. On her way, she is confronted by Xian Lang, who reveals that she was also shunned by her people and fights for Böri Khan only because he treats her as an equal and that no one else does. She also reveals that the attacks on the outposts have been a diversion; Khan's true plan is to capture and execute the Emperor who killed his father. Risking execution, Mulan returns to her battalion to warn them of the impending invasion. The soldiers she befriended stand up for her, and Tung decides to believe her, and allows her to lead them to the Emperor's palace. Xian Lang uses her magic to transform into the Imperial Chancellor (Nelson Lee) and persuades the Emperor to accept Böri Khan's challenge to single combat, while city guards are removed from their posts. The guards are murdered, and the Rourans prepare to burn the Emperor alive. Mulan's unit distracts the Rourans while Mulan goes to save the Emperor. Khan tries to kill her with an arrow, but Xian Lang, sympathetic to Mulan and disenchanted from Khan, transforms into an eagle, and sacrifices herself by taking the arrow. She and Khan fight, during which he is able to disarm her and destroy her father's sword. Mulan causes Khan to fall to the ground, and when he is still alive, she finishes him off, killing him with an arrow to the chest. She frees the Emperor, who offers to let her join his personal guard. She declines the offer and returns to her village to be reunited with her family. After returning home, Commander Tung and a group of soldiers arrive to present Mulan with a new sword, while making a personal request that she join the Imperial Army as an officer. Also starring Rosalind Chao as Hua Li (Mulan's mother), Ron Yuan as Sergeant Qiang, Jun Yu as Cricket, Jimmy Wong as Ling, Chen Tang as Yao, Doua Moua as Chien-Po, Crystal Rao as young Mulan, and Elena Askin as young Xiu. Yifei Liu is terrific as the vulnerable but tough young woman wanting to honour her family, it sticks to roughly the same story, it has no wisecracking talking dragon or songs throughout (apart from ""Reflection"" by Christina Aguilera in the end credits), but with its extraordinary visuals, from colourful costumes and splendid landscapes, to stunning CGI and inventive action, it is a worthwhile fantasy adventure drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Good!",Mulan
7,paul_haakonsen,"It was enjoyable and good, but it had some flaws...",6,13 September 2020,"Well, with this 2020 live action movie version of the classic ""Mulan"" tale, I must admit that my expectations were set up rather high. Especially so since I do like the tale and were looking forward to seeing what director Niki Caro could muster with this project.And now that I have seen ""Mulan"" I can say that I was entertained, sure. But this movie was by no means the grand movie that I had hoped for. Now, don't get me wrong here, because the movie is enjoyable and watchable, but it was just lacking something to make it pop out and be unique and outstanding. Especially when you hold ""Mulan"" up against the endless number of similar movies of Chinese epics that are made in China and Hong Kong.What the 2020 ""Mulan"" had working for it was first and foremost the familiarity of the storyline and plot. But also the cast ensemble, that really impressed me. I mean, ""Mulan"" has the likes of Yifei Liu, Donnie Yen, Li Gong, Jet Li, Jason Scott Lee, Rosalind Chao, Tzi Ma and Xana Tang on the cast list, just to mention the most familiar of performers. And yeah, I was thrilled that they gave Yifei Liu the role of Mulan, because she is a great actress and have some really impressive martial arts epics to her resumé, and she carried the Mulan role quite well. I have to admit that it was nice to see Jet Li on the screen again. One performance that really blew me away was Jason Scott Lee as the villain, wow. His performance as this characters was phenomenal.And one cannot watch ""Mulan"" without taking in all the breathtaking scenery and sets. From the majestic landscapes to the small villages, it was just spectacular to look at. And it was so obvious that the props people had definitely worked well at their tasks, because there were so many nice details and things to observe. And also the costumes and props should be commended here, because they definitely also worked wonderfully.Visually, then I have to say that ""Mulan"" is spectacular to look at. Not only the landscapes and sets, but also the cinematography as a whole. The way the action sequences and martial arts sequences are filmed and presented to the audience, where you can feel the action and how dynamic it all is. At times it felt like you were right there in the frame with the cast.Something that I had problems coping with in the 2020 version of ""Mulan"" was the fact that everyone spoke English. It just took away so much authenticity from the movie. Sure, this was a Disney project, but come on. You can't set a movie in an ancient Chinese dynasty and have everyone speak English. It was just such a stupid thing, and it was cringeworthy that the writers had opted for this. If they had spoken Mandarin, as they were supposed to, the movie would have been all the more enjoyable.Now, one can argue for or against the lack of Mushu in the movie. You know, the quirky dragon from the animated movie, voiced by Eddie Murphy. Sure, I was missing it in the movie, but I think it was a good thing that the writers didn't include Mushu, because it would have been a distracting element that would have taken away focus from the movie as being a serious movie. I believe if they had added Mushu to the live action movie here, it would have dragged down the movie. It pains me to say, because Mushu is the most enjoyable character in the animated movie, and I love the character quite a bit. However, they added a phoenix instead, but it doesn't really interact with Mulan or speak to her, but it worked well, because it was a representation of her ancestry, and it was just beautiful to look at.All in all, ""Mulan"" is an entertaining movie for sure, and I would have rated it a seven star rating if they had not opted to go for the English language being spoken. I enjoyed ""Mulan"" and it is definitely a good movie. My rating, however, lands on a six out of ten stars, because of the language issue.",Mulan
8,studioAT,Mulan 2020,7,28 March 2021,"If, as with a lot of these Disney cartoon to live action films, you take it as being a reimagining rather than a straight remake you'll find a lot to enjoy here.I enjoyed this, I thought it was fun.",Mulan
9,view_and_review,Impressive Though Not a Standout,7,5 September 2020,"I never saw the animated version of ""Mulan,"" but I figured I would watch the live action version. I'm always impressed with the vivid coloration and picturesque scenery of most big production Chinese movies and ""Mulan"" followed that same mold. ""Mulan"" does fall victim to a persistent theme in modern Chinese movies, and that's the theme of old tradition versus modernity. That theme has played out in many Chinese movies to varying degrees of success.""Mulan"" is about old versus new and also about bravery, sacrifice, honor, and all other traits you'd expect to see in a battle movie. In that respect, ""Mulan"" is a solid movie. For the most part it was by the numbers with the addition of a Disney budget to give us some extra cool visual effects. So, I would say that ""Mulan"" is impressive, but not a real standout.",Mulan
10,AlsExGal,I'm glad I watched this at somebody else's house...,3,22 October 2020,"... because I would feel ripped off if I gave Disney any compensation for watching this.As for the story, it doesn't flow, almost every scene feels wasted. The combat sequences are laughably bad for a big budget movie. They downplay the violence a lot, and it doesn't look like anyone that the witch fights gets hurt at all. The villains never feel threatening because we know Mulan has magical powers. The main villain is completely undeveloped. In the original Mulan, the villains were dark, scary, and it put me on edge watching the characters interact with them.The acting seemed bad partially because of the way the story is structured and we never really get to know any of the side characters. Mulan having a sister just wastes screen time. She brought absolutely nothing to the movie.
Everything feels very wooden, and the dialogue doesn't help. Every conversation feels like a forced reference to the original movie but without any of the context. Even in the scenes that are almost a word for word reproduction of the first movie, the delivery is so off that the scenes take on a completely different meaning. Mulan's relationship with her father is completely different (which is fine) but it doesn't come across smoothly.As for Mulan herself, in this film she doesn't have to work to achieve anything. She just has these special powers and she either decides to unleash them or hide them. Thus it is hard to relate to her story or root for her.Rewatch the original Mulan. It has a similar runtime but there is so much more character development. The script is tight. Mushu and Cricket give us insight into what Mulan is thinking and how she's feeling. Without any characters like that, the movie doesn't work.This is just more evidence that Disney is suffering from oversized corporation rot. They have to buy up smaller more creative companies since they seem no longer able to create anything but cinematic visual spectacles, empty and soulless. It scores 3 points solely because it's a visually stunning movie.",Mulan
11,phd_travel,As good as it gets,9,5 September 2020,"Remember to tell yourself this is firstly a Disney Movie which means it isn't supposed to be a pure action movie.
For a Disney movie there is a lot of action and grand battle with an avalanche but there is a likeable character with a story and a journey. There is a nice message about family first and a current message about gender equality.
The look of the movie is well done. The country scenery from mountains to desert is picturesque and the cities and palaces look right not overdone but tasteful CGI.
Crystal Liu is a convincing lead. She looks tomboyish enough when dressed as a man so that her disguise is believable. But when her hair comes down she is pretty.
The supporting cast is impressive. The villains are good. Gong Li is more animated than usual and an attractive and memorable villainess. Jason Scott Lee has aways been an enthusiastic actor. Anson Yo as the lead romantic interest isn't impressive enough. A bit underwhelming. Too small a cameo from Ming Na Wen.
The fault is the dialog and writing lacks humor. There is a little but not enough.
Still this is a well made movie. Liked it more than the recent Live adaptations like Beauty and the Beast and Maleficent 2.",Mulan
12,lasttimeisaw,Film Review - Mulan (2020) 6.4/10,6,7 September 2020,"""In the much coveted role as Mulan, a cool, calm and collected Liu Yifei serviceably passes off as a virtuosic warrior with her well-trained gymnastic prowess (beautifully captured by the tired slo-mo treatment), but as so often she must conceal her comely femininity under a facile mannish comportment, she seems to err on the side of also bottling up Mulan's emotions, which leaves any inward outputting border on minimum, and the story of MULAN is actually very emotional (a baptism of fire experience about warfare, self-identity and defiance), but Liu mainly puts on a brave face and plows on without telegraphing much inner fluctuation, that is a major letdown.""reading the full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",Mulan
13,cherold,"Pleasant, Disneyfied martial arts flick",7,23 November 2020,"Part of Disney's animation-to-life-action project, Mulan tells of a young woman who pretends to be a man so she can go to war.I don't remember much of the original Mulan, except there was a humorous dragon that has been excised for this more realistic version. So this isn't a comparison review, although I recall liking the original better.There are some good things in this movie. The fight scenes are well choreographed and exciting, and famous Chinese actress Li Gong is wonderful as a complicated villainess.But there's really not much to this. There's little character depth, so while things move briskly you don't really feel like you're going anywhere. The concept of chi seems a little murky, in that only two characters seem to have much of it and there's no particularly reason for that; they're both being women seems more like a coincidence.I enjoyed this movie, and if you like a lot of running around and cool fight moments and a yin-yangy villainess then this is worth checking out, but I swear a year from now I won't remember having watched this at all.",Mulan
14,FeastMode,flawed but awesome,7,15 October 2020,"I really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. there were apparent flaws like too many cuts in some fight scenes and some awkward moments that were done much better in the original. but it's easy to let things like that slide when your being thoroughly entertained.lots of cool scenes, good music, and beautiful shots. the main actress did a good job of making me feel mulan's awesomeness. and i was emotionally invested in the characters. oh and did i mention donnie yen is donnie yen? i donnie yenned so loud when he donnie yenned onto the screen. i had no idea he was in it. donnie yen. lol (1 viewing, 10/14/2020)",Mulan
15,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Much worse than the original.,4,3 January 2021,"'Mulan (2020)' - Disney's live-action remake of their own animated classic - is much, much worse than its source material. This is primarily because the piece forgets to have any fun, instead almost always opting for self-seriousness. It's devoid of many of the elements that make the original unique, including its numerous musical numbers, but it isn't streamlined; in fact, it's actually longer than the original. The removal of these elements just makes the piece feel flat and lifeless, a straightforward war story instead of a lively coming-of-age tale. Of course, there are a few new elements exclusive to this version (which, in general, is more period accurate). However, only one of them holds any real weight; the rest do absolutely nothing to enhance the story, which feels oddly restrained despite its more obvious bloodshed (probably because it was made to adhere to Chinese censorship rules). It all feels very by the numbers, a movie made by committee. Frankly, it's rather dull. It is nice to see some proper Asian representation in mainstream US entertainment, though. Its cast is pretty strong, even if most of its members are severely underused, and its message is still as relevant and resonant as ever. Also, it does pick up some steam towards its finale and leaves a relatively decent aftertaste thanks to the two renditions of 'Reflection' during its end credits (a traditionally powerhouse version by Christina Aguilera, who provides a re-recording of her earlier effort, and a mandarin-language version by the film's leading lady, Yifei Liu). However, the picture just isn't a good time overall. It isn't engaging or, even, all that entertaining. There is no reason to watch this instead of the original. 4/10",Mulan
16,dromasca,a 'Mulan' to please everyone,6,19 September 2020,"Niki Caro's 'Mulan' is a film that strives to please as large an audience as possible. The investment of over 200 million dollars makes this production fall into the category of the most expensive films in Hollywood and because it is also a film with a strong feminist message it is worth mentioning that it is currently the most expensive production in the history of cinema directed by a woman. The producers, of course, dream to recoup their investment, which is not an easy task given that the premiere takes place in the year of the COVID-19 pandemic when most cinemas in North America are closed. The challenge of looking for success on alternative streaming channels and in international markets, but especially in China, in parallel with trying to make the film attractive to the traditional audiences of the Disney Studios (children plus one or two generations of company) but also to art martial arts lovers or historical dramas fans have led to the creation of a mixture in which quite a few compromises have inherently been made. The result is a carefully choreographed film, and I'm not just talking about action scenes, and a visually appealing one, but lacking depth and avoiding controversy.The script takes on the legend of Mulan already addressed in a cartoon version made in 1998 and emphasizes both the feminist and patriotic messages. The daughter of the warrior who takes the place of her sick father in the army recruited by the emperor to fight against foreign invasions is endowed with vital forces (the legendary Chinese 'qi') specific to the great fighters. The problem in a male-dominated society was at that time that women with such qualities could be nothing but witches. These prejudices, of course, existed not only in the Far East but also in Catholic Europe or in the colonies of Puritan and Protestant North America. Vital forces are strengthened by moral qualities - courage, loyalty to friends, and faith in the truth, and Mulan will only be able to achieve her destiny by revealing her true identity. The screenwriters managed to navigate skillfully in the politically correct and ideological labyrinths, and to add to the basic moral qualities the family values that work well on any meridian. The result is a little too rose-watered, but not more so than in other Disney movies, and I think it will be quite appealing to the children generations of today and in the future.
From a cinematographic point of view, Niki Caro's film is very well done, combining the landscapes filmed on location in China and New Zealand, the stunts and the effects of computer graphics. The lovers of martial arts in movies can also enjoy a copious and well-executed ,even if not very original, feast of acrobatics, flights and running on vertical walls. Yifei Liu plays the lead model role well, but the most interesting character in the film is her enemy, the evil witch Xianniang, played by Li Gong. Xianniang is what Mulan could become if she doesn't pursue the truth and good causes, and the dialogue between the two women with extraordinary 'qi' forces is perhaps the best moment of the film, and the one in which the feminist message seems truer and less didactic. I believe that the commercial success of 'Mulan' is guaranteed, and even if it will not make as much money as the producers had originally planned. The investments will be recovered and the profit will increase over time. But I don't think it will become a reference film, one of those that will enter the ranks of the immortal classics of the Disney Studios.",Mulan
17,cricketbat,"Mushu, we missed you",6,8 September 2020,"Watching Mulan (2020) made me want to watch Mulan (1998). I kept trying to separate this remake from the animated version, but it kept using music and lines that reminded me why I liked the 1998 musical. This new version features some beautiful visuals and exciting action sequences, even if the story isn't as lighthearted or as fun as the original. As far as Disney live-action remakes go, this one isn't bad, yet it's still proof that these updated versions aren't necessary.",Mulan
18,851222,Beautiful and good family movie,9,11 March 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Mulan"" (2020) was a very pleasant surprise to me. Before watching it i heard a lot of negativity surrounding this movie. And after hearing it i was kinda ""meehh..., i will probably skip it"". But now in 2021 i finally watched it and i was very surprised of how much i actually liked it.""Mulan"" is a superbly made, very beautiful and entertaining family movie. Set design, special effects, locations, and directing were all very good. Pacing of this movie was excellent - at its running time almost 2 hours it barely dragged. Acting was also very good - no Oscar material, but a very solid from all involved.Overall, ""Mulan"" (2020) is a movie that was superbly made in technical department first. And surprisingly it was also very sweet (but not in a ""cheesy"" way) and very touching, because it touches on themes like family honor, loyalty to your country, to what is right and loyalty to yourself. And this is all there is to this film. Ignore the haters, and watch it open minded like i did, and i hope you will be pleasantly surprised like i was.",Mulan

Five stars for expressing the theme of female empowerment, and the critical thought that family honor should not determine a young girl's future. That equality not servitude should be the norm. That girl's should not be molded to be a good wife by having to show obedience, elegance, politeness, poise, gracefulness, and to serve her husband in silence.
One star for the poor flying wire scenes & camera edited, not realistic, fight scenes, & Mulan suddenly wearing lots of makeup with flowing hair when she exposes herself as a female. One star for Disney kowtowing to gain Chinese viewers by appeasing Chinese censorship in promoting obedience to the Emperor (Xi Jinping), and his dynasty (the CCP crackdown on individual freedom).",Mulan

The strengths are in its colourful design and cinematography that make the landscapes and cities of China look absolutely amazing (it was actually shot near my neighbourhood in New Zealand, but you get the idea). However, there are definitely some issues: 1) Mulan has intrinsic superpowers and is overpowered; 2) Mulan never looks or sounds like a man at all; 3) the action is too smooth and appears (ironically) cartoonish; 4) the dialogue is too cheesy even for a Disney film; 5) some scene transitions are too sudden; 6) the character motivations are not always clear.",Mulan

While staying similiar to the story that made the original lovable. The plot following Mulan (Yifei Liu) who is destined by her mother that she needs to meet a man and wed. When a war is coming which the emperor enlists one son from every family. Mulan and her sister being the only siblings. Her father prepares to join but with his aging slowing him down. Mulan takes the family sword and armor. And joins the army to face against a witch army who is plotting to take over the Emperor.Similiar plot. The film is a little serious. Compare to the original which was musical and had talking animals. The film does lack the musical set pieces and talking animals. But it does pay some homage to those characters that may or may not disappoint hard core fans.The cinematography is beautifully done. Capturing the set pieces and settings. The music score is great. The action sequences are exciting and well done. A couple of exciting battle sequences that is well choreographed with the fighting and camera work. The cast ensemble is great.

27,eddie_baggins,A live-action misfire that lacks any heart or charm,4,7 September 2020,"Originally planned to be one of 2020's biggest cinematic releases, the old foe we know as Covid-19 put a stop to Mulan's plans of taking over cinemas around the world, with the high-profile update of the classic Disney animation released now in a premium VOD format to allow fans a chance to finally see their beloved female heroine take flight in a live action world.Many wondered whether this release would detour from the spectacle and magic of the tale but all this worry was for naught as Niki Caro's charisma free and lifeless updating of the tale of young warrior Mulan and her undercover journey in the ranks of the army is so devoid of spark that you feel like little, if anything has been lost in its release from the big screen to the lounge-rooms of millions around the world.Quite clearly the result of significant financial investment and talented craftsmanship, Mulan looks the part of a family friendly fantasy epic but Caro and her behind the scenes creative team have lost any of the heart and soul of the original Disney offering along the way as the film ticks off a series of narrative progressions that are nothing more than markers that can be taken down at various points, as the films delivery and ideas are nothing better than generic at best.It's in many ways amazing that the film is so barren when it comes to any moments of memorability, Mulan herself who is played by the unfortunatly hamstrung Yifei Liu is in most scenes but can't make us care, the film lacks any significantly grandiose or well-staged spectacle despite its budget and the story itself is so by the numbers in its delivery that you will find yourself unwilling to conjure up any type of enthusiasm as you plod your way through the film as a viewer.Doing away with key elements of the animated film such as the song numbers, everyone's favorite talking dragon Mushu and the frequent humor that was a key component of the films initial success, this po-faced re-imaging wants badly to tap into the female hero oriented market that has made itself prevalent in recent years but you can't imagine any child, teenager or adult walking away from Mulan's journey here feeling inspired in any way shape or form.It's hard to pinpoint what went wrong with the film as an outside observer, even the appointment of Caro as the director seemed like a great pick after her form with similar female-oriented features like Whale Rider and North Country proving solid pieces of work, but there's little to recommend about this bland Disney offering that continues on Disney's so-so live action catalogue of films that have mostly failed to inspire much long lasting greatness.Final Say -An extremely by the numbers offering from Disney with fans of Mulan likely to be left cold by this films lifeless and charmless delivery, this epic film may look that part but it lacks severely in almost every angle imaginable.2 phoenixes out of 5",Mulan

29,SAMTHEBESTEST,Packed with Action but lacked Humour and Grounding.,5,9 September 2020,"Mulan (2020) :
Brief Review -Packed with Action but lacked Humour and Grounding. I watched Mulan (1998) just couple of days back and then took time for this live action remake so that i could evaluate both the films on comparative level. This 2020 version of Mulan is actually little bit different from the animated flick not just in production design or apparent filmmaking but also in basic script for that matter. Mulan is more about a woman having talent since birth but not getting chance to explore it whereas the animated feature was about the Equality she was denied. Here, the girl has hidden and stupendous 'Chi' which she could not show to anyone just because she's a girl and Imperial Army is all about Male warriors while in 1998 version the girl learns the talent along with the male warriors and then bests them all. Somehow, this new film is more driven to fictional adventurous path as you might feel it difficult to connect to the Pheonix Bird angle and Witch part (at least i didn't connect). Subsequently, the humour and comedy level is almost close to Nothing i mean Zero figure, hence making it unnecessarily extended and stretched version of sweet little tale.Mulan tops in action sequences with right use of unbelievable sword and spear fights, ground battle and hand to hand combat. Niki Caro's version to Direct this action adventure feels outdated and too mainstream. In couple of action scenes the link between 2 scenes, ground reality of the stunt and intellegence in execution is missing. Thankfully she emerges to win the emotional quotient with things like family bonding, love, gender equality etc.Performance wise, Yifei Liu, Donnie Yen, Gong Li, Jason Scott Lee, Yoson An and Jet Lee are tolerable. Too much of village and imperial culture irritates at several occassions therefore taking the main essence away from the storyline. Overall, Mulan is like any other Average entertainer in today's time and if you wish to relieve compromised nostalgia of Disney then give it a watch. But of you Live the same nostalgia then watch the original again that has more humour, gags and simplicity.RATING - 5/10*By - #samthebestest",Mulan

32,southdavid,Phoenix Fights,6,8 December 2020,"Upfront, I don't have the sort of attachment to the animated version of ""Mulan"" that others have. I was 18 when it came out, and it was right around the time I stopped seeing Disney animated features at the cinema (to this day, I think I've only seen it a couple of times). Judging this ""Mulan"" on its own merits, I saw a film that was entertaining enough - if perhaps lacking in new ideas and with occasional ropey effects.With the Kingdom under attack, the Emperor (Jet Li) calls on each household to submit one male resident to join his army. To save her father Zhou (Tzi Ma) from having to re-enlist, Mulan (Yifei Liu) steals his sword and armour and takes his place, pretending to be male. Though naturally uncomfortable around her fellow soldiers, her determination and an unnaturally high chi level make her the best soldier in her battalion - and soon she clashes with Bori Kahn (Jason Scott Lee) and his shapeshifting witch associate Xianniang (Li Gong).So, whilst I'm glad I didn't pay the extra £15 to see ""Mulan"" early, generally I thought that the film was alright. I really liked Yifei Liu as Mulan, she played the many different facets of the character well. There are a number of recognisable faces, not just the ones I've previously mentioned but also Donnie Yen, Rosalind Chao, Pei-Pei Cheng and a small cameo for Ming-Na Wen. The physical action scenes are pretty good, if occasionally let down by an unusually cheap looking visual effect. I'm really surprised that Disney allowed them to go out, looking as dodgy as they do, given the money at their disposal. I could have done without this Chi/Force business, as I felt that diluted the idea that Mulan and by extension all women, can be as capable if not more so than their male counterparts.The question is I suppose, is ""alright"" really enough for a $200 Million budgeted film and it's that weight of expectation - alongside the love for animated version - that has turned against ""Mulan"" somewhat. I thought it was fine, but I can't imagine I'm going to rush back to watch it again any time soon.",Mulan

It's a study on how not to re-tell a story.First, let's go over the good parts. It's a pretty little film. It has wuxia feel to it and all the different set pieces are well-made and suitably elaborate. I also liked the costuming and the action choreographies. Suffice to say, this film looks very good.But then comes the story. You've taken one of the most iconic Disney heroines and you've turned her into a deus ex machina. You've taken a girl who chose to rebel against social expectations and triumph despite all her disadvantages, and you've turned her into the chosen one who succeeds because she was born with magical powers. Can you see how that's so much worse? How that's so much more demeaning?Add in all the other magical bovine manure and senseless directing choices, and you have a film that has none of the charm of the original. None of the uplifting heroics. None of the gender equality. This Mulan doesn't save China while being a girl. She saves China despite being a girl.

36,subxerogravity,A mediocre Disney animated feature turned into a Mediocre live action remake.,6,5 December 2020,"Wow! Glad I didn't spend 30 bones for that.I was not a fan of the original Mulan. outside of the song ""Be a man!' which should have been in this movie, I even see the scene where it should have been. Mulan was not one of the animated classics I was feeling as a kid. In fact, after the Lion King I was out the door and so was Disney really (if not for Pixar).On one side it's good that China was like don't do this and don't do that as it made this Mulan unique to it's own. Although I really like the live action remake of Aladdin that really followed the original movie, I thought the new Lion King wasted a lot of time and money making a carbon copy of the 1994 classic.On the other side, Disney's attempts to make China happy and get their money created a movie that was very serious in tone. Not what I was expecting from this live action remake. in those tiny attempts to be amusing the movie flops do to the stick up its behind. It felt stiff too. like it was constipated the whole time I was watching it. Needed to loosen up.The idea of having Donne Yen and Jet Li in the same movie would have been enough to get me running to the theatre, if it was another movie.The action scenes could have been better, way better. Trying not to stereotype the culture, I did not go into this expecting Couching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but then they give you just a little and then you wish they gave you none.I don't want to come down too hard on this flick. I was feeling the message they were trying to feed us with Mulan, but it is a message that did not really fill the entire movie.Jason Scott Lee was impressive looking as the villain, which is odd because I herd China hated the way the villain looked in the original, and if you ask me Lee looks just as scary as that guy (maybe because he looks scary in a sexy way). Wish there was more of Lee as the villain.Also wish Mushu was in the flick but I herd China was not feeling that either. Maybe because they did not get the voice of Eddie Murphy coming out of him in their Chinese dub.Anyway, Mulan was ok just like the animated movie it was based on. Whatever China did to have Disney change the movie may not have help but I doubt it would have been better if Disney did it there way.

40,alindsay-al,A Below Average Pointless Film,4,7 December 2020,"So this film has been available on Disney+ for an extra fee for months but I am really cheap so I have waited till it is free with the streaming service to watch it and that day is today so here is my review for the 2020 version of the film Mulan. The premise of the film sees a young Woman disguise herself as a man in order to take her fathers place in the Chinese army.Main Character
Chinese actress Yifei Liu plays the titular character and I mean she is fine in the role, she feels appropriate for the role and does a decent job in the action scenes which is important for the role and she does an okay job in some of the emotional scenes. But I just don't really know why I did not care about Mulan much in this film, I just couldn't find anything to attach myself too and I found her character to be quite dull and not offering much to stand out in terms of a lead role.Supporting Characters
This film doesn't have a particularly great supporting cast but the one who stands out to me is Donnie Yen, his character isn't the most compelling but he does a fine job and you can tell he is easily the best actor in the action scenes and he is a highlight in these scenes. I also thought the actor that played Mulan's father did a good job and sold the emotion of their scenes well together. But the rest of the cast didn't do much at all, I mean Jason Scott Lee plays the main villain but similar to the animated film, he is just a bad guy Mulan has to defeat with no character and no depth to him. Different to the animated film there is an evil witch added here and it seems they tried to give her some character but they failed and she becomes an addition that feels out of place here. Like the animated film Mulan has some allies in the army and they were charming in that film but it doesn't work here and these characters are dull and you really won't care at all.Story
In these Disney live action remakes I feel like they are damned if they do damned if they don't. If they keep the story the same they are accused of being lazy and if they change it people go against it so this film kind of does a bit of both. Characters like Mushu are missing and I honestly think this story doesn't work and I will explain why, in the animated film the reason it works is that Mulan goes from this normal girl who becomes a warrior but this film completely changes it and attempts to make her some sort of superhero and it feels cheap and like the film loses all of its heart. The other issue is that I didn't care about any of the characters here, not even Mulan and the film really banks on you doing that which hurt its plot.Script
The film has some okay dramatic moments in it that actually works which is better then most things here. It is just, I am not saying this film should be a comedy, but it takes itself so seriously and becomes a drab watch as the seriousness makes you care less and less about this pretty dull execution.Style
One thing the film has going for it, is that it looks amazing. In terms of its visual this is one of the best of the year in my opinion, the backgrounds look great and if the film was scored on the way it looks only it would be a much better score. But it isn't and here we go with another criticism but it is actually a technical one, when the action scenes were taking place there are just so many cuts, the film is cutting all over the place and it becomes so jarring, it is hard to explain unless you watch the film. The only time it doesn't do this when Yen is doing action and it seems like the rest of the cast weren't as strong in the action or the director was just poor at filming them.Overall
Overall, this is a below average film that actually upsets me. If people remember back at the beginning of the year, this film was high up in my most anticipated films of 2020 and it just fails to hit those levels and leaves it one of the biggest let downs in recent years.",Mulan
41,CubsandCulture,Competes with Dumbo (2019) as the worst Disney live-action adaptation,4,9 December 2020,"While Dumbo is still much worst, this Mulan is both utterly pointless and so utterly bland. When Disney announced that they were making a live-action Mulan they took pains to say that they removed such elements as Mushu and the songs to make the resulting film closer to the folktale. Fair enough. But upon watching the film I really don't know why they bothered with this marketing. This version also introduced concepts, characters not present in the folktale and the added elements pale in comparison to what the animated film did. Qi (Chi) is fundamentally misrepresented as a RPG mana-like magical resource. That is probably the most culturally tone deaf thing in either version. The film also adds a witch character that stands at odds with the more ""historical"" tone the film was allegedly going for. They might as well kept Mushu if they were going to do that.The film is exceedingly bland. There's a stuffiness to the proceedings that makes everything too ponderous and self-serious.

46,kluseba,"Colourful, empowering and vibrant",9,11 December 2020,"Everyone who reads this review is probably familiar with the inspiring Chinese folk tale and the animated Walt Disney movie that conquered box offices twenty-two years ago. This version brings the legendary story to life with strong acting performances, colourful settings and breathtaking special effects. The movie manages to remind of the old tale while also incorporating elements of fantasy martial arts cinema in the key of Hero and House of Flying Daggers.The movie features young and old stars of Chinese cinema. It was great seeing Jet Li again in a movie after a prolonged absence and he certainly has some charisma as the Emperor in this film. Donnie Yen has an even more important role as Commander Tung who is severe but fair with his young soldiers. Liu Yufei incarnates Hua Mulan's character traits very well and plays a courageous, headstrong, intelligent, rebellious and resilient lead character very convincingly. Along side her, Yoson An convinces as loyal, reliable and sociable soldier who befriends Hua Mulan. There are some slight romantic undertones between these two characters but Disney gladly didn't dwell on this and truly focuses on the image of a strong and independent female warrior.The film's settings are absolutely breathtaking. Hua Mulan's village looks like a tiny fortress with a round shape where citizens can easily interact. The first scene of the movie sees the young protagonist chasing after a chicken and it truly brings life in rural China to life. The scenes in the steppes featuring dusty plains and icy mountains are equally breathtaking and show how diversified China's landscapes are. The finale in the Imperial City is certainly a highlight as the palace and its surroundings look colourful, elegant and inspiring. Even though many locations have been created with special effects, they all look rather realistic and underline the atmospheric vibes of the film.The movie's special effects have been employed with care and precision. The fighting scenes are quite imaginative. Highlights are the epic battles on the steppes, the fights in the alleys of Imperial City and the showdown at a construction site. One also has to point out Xianniang, a powerful witch with shapeshifting abilities played by Li Gong. Her make-up, dresses and transitions into a falcon are absolutely outstanding. Li Gong looks absolutely gorgeous and I was in disbelief to learn that she is actually fifty-four years old as she looks easily twenty years younger.In the end, Mulan is an excellent fantasy film with much imagination that should entertain entire families from start to finish. Those interested in Chinese culture, history and society will appreciate this beautiful movie even further. The Blu-ray comes with some detailed looks behind the scenes and some deleted scenes that are certainly worth the attention of anyone who has appreciated this movie as much as I have.",Mulan

48,s3276169,Very much by the numbers Disney fare but worthwhile nonetheless......,7,10 September 2020,"""Mulan"" has seen a recent Chinese release as well this Western release, by Disney. The Chinese film is probably closer to the harsh realities that underline the sentiment that defines the tale. It's grim, there's lots of self sacrifice, death and blood.That said,that's not Disney's core market (at least that's my understanding) and this film reflects that fact. I'll add i don't hate the Disney film. I know there have been a lot of negative reviews but what needs to be kept in mind is the typical ""audience"" for Disney films. Families, younger viewers, so its not going to be as violent or adult orientated as other versions of this story.What it does do well is competently tell Mulan's tale in a very watchable manner. Yes its got the usual Disney bright, cheerfulness but its not overdone and the core message of sacrifice for family is front and centre.The action scenes are polished done, the cinamatic's outstanding and the acting is well above average too.So for those who want a serious, mature take on the story of Mulan, no this film may not be for you (track down the Chinese film instead). For families, younger viewers and general audiences this film is very accessible and I, for one, enjoyed it.In fact, to be honest its the first film from Disney, I've enjoyed unreservedly in quite a while.7/10.",Mulan
49,questl-18592,Disney 2020,2,13 December 2020,"Disney needs to stop making these live action remakes. They're all bad. Every one of them. I feel like people watch them at this point for the same reason they keep going back to that restaurant that gave them food poisoning that one time. ""Well, it could've been good, I know I shouldn't but I'll give it another shot. Maybe it'll be better next time."" No. No it wont. I'm just as guilty of that too. I thought, if any Disney movie could work in live action, it's Mulan. At it's core, Mulan is a story of a young woman fighting against gender stereotypes and hereditary patriarchal control to show that she is strong, that she can control her own destiny. Mulan is a war movie, an action film with a focus on martial arts and Eastern combat. Even without dragons, this could have been an epic war film with a Joan of Arc-esque story of triumph and empowerment in a time when gender equality is still at the forefront of our social ethics.Then I actually watched it. This movie is a #@*&!%$# mess! It's awful! It wants to have it's cake and eat it too, it wants to not be magical enough for the fun characters, it's too magical to be realistic. It's too predictable, it's poorly plotted and paced out. Lip Yifei could make for an incredible Mulan, she was cast well but this whole experience is a complete disaster of a film. There's songs that feel super out of place, moments of 'whimsy' that feel super clunky. It reminds me too much of the Avatar: The Last Airbender or Dragonball Evolution movies and that is probably the greatest insult I can give it.I give it slight props for some of the casting, especially Yifei and Yen but that's it.

52,jadepietro,Action Over Words,8,9 December 2020,"IN BRIEF: A lavish but conventional retelling of a Disney animated classic.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) The war rages on...no, not the battle over Chinese dynasties. I'm talking about Disney's on-going raid of its animated features into live action films to seize your dollars. Some movies have been big improvements. Others mediocre imitations of the original. Thankfully this update is the former. Gone are the pop songs, the comic wise-cracking dragon, the animated awe, the fun. We are talking serious transformation. Visually sweeping in its epic filmmaking, Mulan (2020) still retains some minor problems in its Disneyfied storytelling. Our plucky heroine may be in search of her own identity. But so is this movie as it presents stock stick figures talking in fortune cookie bromides set against lavish settings. Yes, the script-by-committee strategy loses the battle.This Disney princess is played by Yfei Lui and this beautiful actress is rather bland in the role. She is very likable, but physically she never persuades us that she is a secret soldier, disguised as a man, fighting for the Imperial Army against evil forces. The movie suffers from Yentl Syndrome. (For those unaware of this condition, all you need to do is watch the Barbra Streisand film to see that, in no way, does she resemble a man, so all sense of reality and authenticity is lost.) Such is the case with Ms. Lui's performance. Her feminine voice and stance, her chi, is far from being male. The all-Asian cast tries valiantly to spin this folklore tale convincingly but their characters never seem remotely real-to-life. Only Gong Li as Xianniang, a powerful witch, attains some depth of character. And that is due to the actress, not the script.However, the major strengths of the film are Niki Caro's skilled direction and the panoramic scope lensed by cinematographer Mandy Walker. The director stages her many battle sequences with much flair and, though she tends to overdo the slo-mo in the martial arts close-ups, the effect is breathtaking. Her choreographed action scenes would make David Lean proud. Ms. Walker's lovely use of bright primary colored palette supplies the needed grandeur. Grant Major's production design is strong as are the opulent costumes by Bina Daigeler. (This movie should have been seen on the big screen for its CGI and ambitious staging.)Mulan (2020) is grandiose filmmaking on a big budget. Yet with all its visual scope, it is a prime example of actions speaking louder than words. (GRADE: B)",Mulan
53,rgkarim,Mulan or Pew-Lan?,6,5 September 2020,"It's another age old question that comes with each year, why are we getting a live action remake of a Disney classic? Well the answer comes in many forms, but I'm more about is this remake worth it/good? Given my experience with home releases... these films have not quite held the same bite that the theater has, so I was a bit worried about this delayed feature.

Writers:
Rick Jaffa (screenplay by), Amanda Silver (screenplay by)
Stars:
Yifei Liu, Donnie Yen, Li Gong
LIKES:The Culture And Mythos of China

The Political Prowess Vs. Storytelling
The shoddy Attempts At Making Other Story Components
No Attachment to the Main Characters

Missing the memorable music
The Battles Are short, A bit Cheesy, and Uncoordinated
Battles Lack Suspense
Missing the Spirit Of the OriginalSummary:It is always inspiring to see the surrounding lands of international countries and Mulan gives one the sense of visiting China and it's beautiful world. This film's camera work and design dive heavy into the mythology of the Asian provinces, helping to bend them into the winds of the tale and introduce us to some symbolic values of the culture. This production focused very heavily on the concepts of honor and the discipline the feudal era of this land instilled on men and women who served the dynasty. Maybe a bit stereotypical, but I felt the director was able to integrate the components well and give us the political and story elements that we expected to drive our heroine. The live action Mulan also has a beautiful aesthetic to the characters with the rich patterns, artistic makeup, and props I expected from my limited studies of the ancient lands of China. I loved the build of the world and settings, feeling immersed partly into the field and taking my place next to Mulan and the world that would be her arena.
Speaking of arenas, the fighting of this installment at times steps up its game from the cartoons, breaking out martial arts and weapon styles that I dreamed of doing as a kid. Mulan herself shows off several styles that mirrored the great Kung Fu Works of Lee and Chan (not nearly as fluid, but grandiose) as she fought the army of extras. Other characters managed to pull out some impressive moves, with rapid sword play and archery poses that held that exciting touch I love to see in my fights. While these moments are sparingly, I do give them props for the execution at times and the panning shots of the war as CGI meets real world. And if you're a parent you got to appreciate the censorship so that the little ones won't be corrupted. Amidst all this is a beautiful soundtrack, filled with the symphonic works of regular cinema orchestra and Chinese instruments working in tandem to help bring more emotion to the scene or sequence. And despite not having the most vocal work, Christina Aguilera gets her reprise in this film alongside a few other artists at the end to help further broaden Disney Soundtrack creations, which I think came a little too late, but better late than never right? Yet the best thing for me was the cinematography, and how well it captured the environment, the scale of the fights, and those key moments to help bring this live action more to life. Mulan's visual team deserves a lot of credit for helping add flare to the movie, and give you many references and approaches into one semi-cohesive product.However, there were a lot of shortcomings for me in this film, which could have been due to watching it at home magnifying them or just the movie itself. The story is rushed, with a lot of pieces thrown into the story and then quickly diced out in various sizes. Caro and her staff tried to inject a lot of things that included stories of training, friendship amongst the soldiers, potential romance, the concept of honor, several villain developing, fighting for herself, and trying to hide her identify. Sure the other version did this, but it did it better, as this film lacked the balance it needed and the fluid execution that other films have done. So many of the characters were background, their names barely mentioned and their stories even sadder as they tried to force everything into bite sized pieces. Only Mulan's moments held any backbone as her father and hers's relationship promised a strong beginning, that petered out to Mulan being the only one capable of doing much of anything. I was not attached to most of the other characters, as there was just no focus on them, little personality, and diluted involvement compared to the loveable band of the cartoon. To get the arrows shot at me, I feel this is due to the current method of political agenda over story, this one being the focus of a woman defying all odds to save the war. I have not read the full legend of Mulan, but I expect the writers amplified the woman hear me roar and kind of forgot the other parts of the story. It was that focus that took away from so much of the potential of the movie and all the other characters that could have made Mulan's tale even better and more fulfilling. Even the villains held potential, but sadly the two main villains were reduced to elaborate, overacted one liners, some empty threats, and few ridiculous looking stunts. I know Shan Yu held little backstory, but there was fear, power, and a merciless mindset to him that made him deadly and a true villain. This guy had a slight mention of his back story and goals, but that was about it as so much of his promise was washed away with the scattered displays of the other characters and the focus on Mulan's struggles.
In regards to the other areas of improvement, Disney seems to have a hard time being naturally funny anymore, and instead works to force laughter into a film that doesn't need so much of it. Live action Mulan has little that made me laugh, only the innocence of a youth and few funny tatters getting a chuckle for me. Though the movie had great music to set the stage... it still was not the same magic that Disney laid on my ears years ago. Gone where the whimsical thoughts of the fellow soldiers in song and dance, or the deep ballad Mulan questioning her identity that brought so much life to the cartoon. Those songs obviously would be out of place in a more serious film, but when you don't support those components strongly, I started to really miss the campy numbers. But again this movie was supposed to be more on showing off the warrior side of Mulan and as I said earlier in ways it did. Yet... in many ways it still failed to pull everything together. This film's approach again seemed uncoordinated in how in depth they could go, perhaps due to the political focus, perhaps due to the censorship that Disney seems to force on its groups. Mulan's fights are short with most lasting less than ten minutes, and most of the good fighting scenes lasting less than two. While paying tribute to the classic fights via flying through the air with cables and over the top acrobatics, the movie did a little too much of this and forewent crafting a battle that was coordinated. Scenes jumped around, passing glances of our main cast doing a movie haphazardly interlaid with Mulan doing know wrong, and even the clashing of armies was reduced to overhead shots that were only okay to watch. I felt no suspense for any of these fights, because there was no heat and without caring about the characters I did not really have any ties to the fights at hand. As you can guess, though the cartoon did not have the most action set and worthy fights, it had characters and tense sequences for me because I had grown to care for the small army and that's what made them special. This one though... missing so much of that and thus while visually beautiful, creative and storytelling wise they were arrows that missed it's mark.The VERDICTDisney made a fair shot at the tale of Mulan and succeeded on the fronts I think they were wanting to succeed on. It's a powerful display of culture and opening up the world of Chinese myth, with costumes and cinematography to really wow those who appreciate these effects. Those looking for the girl power tale will also be highly pleased with this, for many highlights of the fighting are indeed Mulan's moves and the training she shows off amidst heavy instrument work and sound editing. Yet, the film fails to grasp the magic of the last movie and the components it wanted to focus on were disjointed, not well fleshed out, and very lacking if it did not center on Mulan herself. I did not grasp onto the other characters much at all, I felt no real development of so many elements, and all the facets of the story failed to reach their full potential that I know Disney can make work. As for the battles, again visually the look beautiful and have nods to classic styles of fighting, but they lack the heart and suspense I think these moments need. As such, this Mulan lacks much of the spirit the original cartoon held in more ways than one. Was it worth the thirty dollar admission for early viewing? The answer is no for me, and I would wait this one out for viewing in December when it opens up. My scores for this film are:Action/Adventure/Drama: 6.5
Movie Overall: 5.0",Mulan
54,Kamurai25,"""Move On Mulan""",5,10 December 2020,"Disappointing watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend.I finally see what everyone is freaking out about this movie. Mostly, it is because it just left all the spirit of the first movie behind and started over.They made a conscious effort to ditch the goofiness, and magic animals of the first one to do a more gritty and real version, like a DC movie. After those decisions, they also chose to reintroduce actual magic, but mostly for the villains, who had slightly better women's rights(?).I'll be honest, the movie itself wasn't interesting enough to follow completely. For instance, I know ""Mushu"" was replaced with a phoenix, but I have no idea what happened to it.Mulan also is outed much sooner in this, but basically skirts execution about 3 different times because of her accomplishments with a much more laid back atmosphere than it was in the 1998 version.Despite all the money poured into the movie that keeps it from being a bad movie, it just doesn't feel good.

The Game Of Thrones Daenerys Dragon wings moment with Phoenix was really cringeworthy.People will remember Aladdin because of Will Smith, Beauty and Beast because of Emma Watson and Cinderella because Lily James and Cat Blanchett but sadly Mulan has no rememberable quality except that you paid $30 bucks on top of already monthly paid subscription.",Mulan

Directed by Niki Caro of Zookeeper's Wife this live action adaptation falls on the better side of the recent trend. Not that it says much considering the recent cinematic tragedies Aladdin (2019) and Lion King (2019) are part of the group. Most of the film is actually pretty great. Caro directs the proceedings with a questionable zest at times
The film is at it's strongest when it's more serious but delves into a goofy, cartoonish tone at times. That being said there's alot to love here from the beautiful cinematography to the gorgeous score, the inspired costume, make-up and set design. The central performance from Yifei Liu is accomplished and engaging. In the end it's mostly a great film even when it's at it's cheesiest. It may be not be flawless and in fact it's far from it but it's a worthy adaptation that never quite lives up to the original or it's potential but is a successful venture on it's own fantastical terms.****/5",Mulan

This is big drawback of such movie, it should have a very first scene at the movie to bind you till end and rest story can be shown in flashback. After passed one hour, action is coming in action and we can see amazing war fights sequences for near about 45-50 minutes. Means this movie only entertain you for 40-50 minutes, rest part looks unnecessary or less important due to poor story line and script. Donnie Yen was wasted in his role. He has no scope for his fighting skills. Likewise Jet Li. Though Mulan is brilliant in action but failed in emotions. Overall it is above average movie, not so good or not bad. Only amazing war scenes, breath taking archery actions, beautiful photography and good background score are plus points of such weak story line movie. It could have been better.

67,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,"Not as bad as other say, but not worth the $30 PPV, YMMV",7,5 September 2020,"The cinematography, the elaborate sets, artistry, costume and wardrobe, visual effects, fight/sword choreography and the horsemanship/archery on the battlefield were all phenomenal. Some of it reminiscent of the battles scenes from Games of Thrones, except with significantly more saturated colorful and no blood spillage and gore. They get away with it by cutting the camera to another camera just as blade is less than an inch from being thrusted into an enemy solder. So we get implied kills without the carnage.The only shed of blood comes from the witch that nicks her finger on Mulan's sword and a few small droplets fall on the ground. Its a high budget Disney flick with the high production values to match but restrained by the PG-13 rating.The acting is about average. I did not see anyone belt out an academy worthy acting performance that left me impressed. Fans of the animated serious will take issue with changes from the original animated film. But I did not watch the original animated film so I had nothing to compare it too.I honestly think this film will have many friends and enemies in the the industry. Not because of the content of the movie, but buy the business experiment Disney is doing by providing a $30-PPV option that are scare people who work for the entertainment theaters. If Disney succeeds and makes a large amount of profit, other companies might be tempted to jump in and bypass the theater openings all together. Those industry insiders can see their theater chains under threat.Today the best image quality for films is arguably at home with newer OLED technology TVs that really make these film pop in a way theater projection cannot. Yes, the $30 price is higher, but I can see friends chipping in to watch this on a really high end television and HT system and make better food at home. In that case, the $30 price pails in comparison to taking a family 4 and concession goodies can easily go three times over that initial price of $30. Disney promotes itself as a family movie company so....hmm the writing is on the wall. Theaters are dying. OLED gives better image quality *Today*, QD-OLED, even better tomorrow, and MicroLED display technology in the distant future will just pat the dirty down over the grave of the movie theater houses. The die-hart theater lover will go into the dark kicking and screaming as the home screen becomes the new venue to watch these films.EDIT Sept 16, 2020.
Apparently there is a huge political Brouhaha over this film that I wasn't even aware of when I wrote my original review above which explains the passionate dislike for the film. Non-Asian Americans just don't like how the songs were left out from the original animation. Asians (both in the US and abroad) are angry at the protagonist, actress Yifei Liu, support for the Chinese CCP crackdown on the people of Hong Kong. And in some irony, many mainland Chinese are upset of the portrail of the real life historical Mulan in this film as being pro-emperor (pro establishment) rather than pro-family. So it seems Disney managed to piss off everyone. In any case, I still think its an okay Kung Fu action adventure even if it isn't historically accurate. Perhaps Disney should stick to animation instead of live action. Their record with live action isn't very good lately with fans.",Mulan

70,Snootz,Mediocre and Absurd,5,12 September 2020,"It's Disney. It's Mulan. We expect a certain degree of fantasy (perhaps even a lot) and a certain degree of over-the-top. This presentation however has little in the way of heart, soul, or believability. (Seriously... killing someone by THROWING an arrow? Only the most gullible would believe that adulteration of basic physics.)I can't go further into the ""why's"" of failure without spoilers, so I'll just have to leave it at that. I don't compare this to the animated version as some do; I judge it by its own merit. (However, the animated version WAS far better.) The acting in this was good, the sets incredible. The choreography was acceptable (though many Asian martial arts far excel in that aspect). The music wasn't all that impressive; typical Disney fare that didn't match the Mulan setting at all.So get ready for an action movie with a story story that falls fall short of expectations. I have enjoyed several other Disney remakes, but this one didn't cut it. The plot is rather pedestrian, with nothing to put this above a mediocre ""another Disney attempt"" 5-stars.",Mulan

73,kjproulx,A Welcome Remake with a Few Too Many Issues,7,5 September 2020,"Whether you're talking about the amazing job that Disney did in remaking The Jungle Book in live-action or how they made a very disappointing attempt at bringing Dumbo back to life, there's no denying that they aren't slowing down anytime soon. Mulan was their latest to be released earlier this year, but due to many complications, it has now premiered on Disney+. While I can't say it surpasses the animated original in any way, it's absolutely one of the better remakes they've done. I could see this reaching a wide audience over time, but with this particular release strategy, I can't see 2020s Mulan making a big enough splash. Here are my thoughts on Mulan as a whole.Much like the original film, this rendition of Mulan follows the titular hero as she disguises herself as a man in order to join the war in place of her father. Going against traditional family and gender beliefs, she rises to the occasion and bests everyone around her. She's had training her whole life, so it comes as no surprise at all when she's able to pull off incredible feats, which I feel is the film's greatest downfall, even though it's entertaining. The emotional core is very much present, but things do feel like they're glossed over at times. With that said though, for every minor issue, there was always a positive to balance it all out.As I said, the greatest downfall is that there's not a single surprising thing to the character of Mulan this time around. On top of that, the absence of music is very much felt here, because they chose to include narration, explaining certain character's choices instead. This felt very pointless to me as it felt like it was dumbing everything down for the audience. I truly feel that these choices did hurt the film as a whole. Still, this is a very well-made movie all around.From the score to the cinematography, this film feels epic in every sense of the word. Sadly, with it being sent to streaming, the big screen experience just won't be possible for this movie anymore. There are some massive sweeping shots that would've benefited from a giant screen, but it is what it is. For this reason, I found myself attached to the more subtle character moments, which ended up giving the movie a layer I may not have latched onto on the big screen. Maybe that's just me, but I felt the movie's weaknesses were given an accent with this watch-at-home tactic.In the end, the 2020 live-action remake of Mulan probably isn't going to have die-hard fans preferring it over the one the loved in the past, but newcomers may get a nice story to follow along with. Yifei Liu does a great job in the title role and felt like she was paying homage to the animated film while also making it her own. The original story is still present, but different, which was nice, and the epic scope is absolutely felt, making this a great movie to look at. I will say some of the creative choices/changes didn't quite work for me, but it's still a very enjoyable movie overall. I'd say give it a watch, especially for families.",Mulan

76,msbreviews,Mulan is the most disappointing remake Disney has done so far and by far...,4,5 September 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)As you might now, this remake is one of my most anticipated movies of 2020 (list here). I've at least ""liked"" almost every remake Disney has delivered so far, so I was incredibly excited that 1998's Mulan was getting the same treatment. Niki Caro made it clear this would be an entirely different version of the story we all know and love. A more realistic take on the Chinese tale, one that removes all songs and fan-favorite characters like Mushu, which instantly impacted expectations, varying tremendously from person to person. People who would love a remake quite similar to the original will enter the film already slightly discouraged. However, to everyone who complained about Disney copying their original IP, Mulan might be their best chance to like a remake from the studio.In my opinion, a remake should have a bit of both. It must keep the original's essence and message while delivering something that distinguishes it from the former. Any remake must always prove the reasons behind its existence. It must have something that makes the viewers think: ""I like this part that's not in the original"". Aladdin has a new arc given to Jasmine. Beauty and the Beast provides Beast with a better-developed storyline. Even The Lion King, a remake that convinced many people to call it a shot-for-shot (it isn't), presents a groundbreaking visual experience that's incomparable to the original. Therefore, I was genuinely hyped for Mulan and what Niki Caro could bring with her more pragmatic cut...I can't deny it: I feel extremely disappointed. In my review of the original movie, I mention how epic and cinematic it feels. It was one of the aspects I looked forward to the most in this new version. Despite the beautiful set design and some painting-like shots, this is the first time a Disney's live-action remake loses to its original regarding its visuals. The 2D animation from more than twenty years ago feels superior in every single aspect. There's only one shot in the entire remake that I would put in the original, and I bet it would look and feel a lot more emotionally significant. The action sequences are unimaginative and incredibly disjointed. Except for a few great war moments, most action scenes are packed with excessive CGI, a badly employed HFR (high frame rate), and overediting.In fact, the editing (David Coulson) is weirdly overworked throughout the entire runtime, cutting too much and omitting sequences that were supposed to significantly impact the narrative. From character-defining moments to simple connections between scenes, it feels like the film is hiding something. I constantly needed to rely on my knowledge of the original to remember why certain moments are meaningful to a character or to the story itself because this remake straight-up removes these moments without replacing them with something else. Even in chronological terms, it's clumsily put together, jumping from location to location without actually showing the characters moving from one place to another.Finally, as my last remark on the technical aspects, Harry Gregson-Williams' score is partially also a letdown. Like the rest of the movie, there are some nice touches and lovely homages to the songs everyone cherishes, especially Reflection. I had already mentalized myself to ignore the absence of songs because I believed Harry would find a way to replace them with a similarly grand score that I would definitely enjoy. However, Mulan's score fails not only to elevate a single battle sequence but also to deliver that cinematic atmosphere that I was looking forward to so much. I didn't get chills during the entire film. It didn't transform any big character moments. Maybe watching it on IMAX instead of at home might improve my opinion, but I doubt that.Story-wise, it's a mixed bag for me. Niki Caro promised a more realistic take, totally different from the original, and she undoubtedly accomplished that. This is the furthest from the original any Disney remake has been, by far. From the replacement of characters to an overall change to the main narrative, Mulan is more faithful to the original Chinese tale than the 1998's flick, but that doesn't mean it's better, much on the contrary. The essence and message are there but told through a distinct perspective, which some people will find hard to accept, especially hardcore fans of the original movie. However, I do believe that Hua Mulan still carries the characteristics that made me care about her.Her courage and bravery to go to war in order to save her father from certain death. Her love and devotion to her family, who she wants to honor. Hua Mulan doesn't want to just be the wife of some random man nor be imprisoned by dated stereotypes. This is all in the remake but told through the lenses of a protagonist who already has everything she needs to lead a nation. This is the main difference character-wise, but one that doesn't affect the nature of the original. However, it impacts the remake itself. While all of this sounds amazing, Mulan sort of contradicts itself by making her main character feel unique and different from everyone else, distancing her more from people than actually embracing her.Like I already mentioned above, this is an entirely altered version of the story everyone knows. I do welcome every change made, including the removal of Mushu, Cri-Kee, and all of the singing. However, if something's removed, something else has to replace it in some shape or form. Once again, I have mixed feelings. Some additions, like the introduction of Chi and the witch Xian Lang (Gong Li), are refreshing but poorly developed throughout the runtime. The vital energy force is connected to my issue with the ""be yourself"" message, while the character not only follows a predictable arc, but it diminishes Bori Khan's (Jason Scott Lee) menacing presence.The ending feels remarkably underwhelming as well. Not only the climactic fight between Hua Mulan and Bori Khan fails to live up to expectations, but it's executed in a visually disheartening fashion. I expected this remake to feel grand, magnificent, epic, and cinematic, just like its original or even better. It's far from that. The acting could also be better. Liu Yifei is fantastic as Hua Mulan, Yoson An offers a subtle yet efficient interpretation of Chen Honghui, and the actors who portray Yao (Chen Tang), Ling (Jimmy Wong), and Chien-Po (Doua Moua) are also amusing. However, Donnie Yeng as Commander Tung and Jet Li as The Emperor are embarrassingly bland, while Jason Scott Lee is visually perfect casting as the main villain, but he's not able to shine.In the end, Mulan is the most disappointing remake Disney has made so far and by far. Even though Niki Caro delivers the realistic, distinct take that was promised, its execution feels inferior to the original animated film in every single way. Technically and visually, it's the first live-action remake from the respective studio that loses in almost every aspect to the 2D animation from more than twenty years ago. The 1998's movie is far more epic and cinematic than its remake. The disjointed editing is overworked to the point of omitting and skipping through character-defining moments. The action scenes are packed with unnecessary CGI that takes away from the war set pieces, which also look small in scale. The musical score isn't able to replace the songs from the original, overflowing the film with a weirdly empty feeling. Despite Liu Yifei delivering a good performance as the protagonist as well as a few of her colleagues, the acting is pretty mediocre overall. Story-wise, it's a mixed bag. It's an undoubtedly unique version, the furthest that a Disney's remake has ever been from its original, which will instantly upset some and please others. I praise the courage and bravery in producing such a different version. There are dozens of new additions that I sincerely appreciate, but their execution lacks emotional impact, ultimately being decisions inferior to the ones of the original. The message and essence of the original are still present through another perspective, which is the best compliment I can give to an otherwise quite disappointing remake...Rating: C-",Mulan

80,MrDHWong,Takes a beloved modern classic of Disney animation and bleeds it dry of virtually everything that was fun and interesting about it in the first place,4,17 September 2020,"Mulan is a live action reimagining of the 1998 animated Disney film of the same name, which itself is an adaptation of the Chinese folk story ""The Ballad Of Mulan"". Directed by Niki Caro (Whale Rider, The Zookeeper's Wife), it takes a beloved modern classic of Disney animation and bleeds it dry of virtually everything that was fun and interesting about it in the first place.In Ancient China, invading warriors to the north led by Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) threaten the life of its Emperor (Jet Li) and the rest of the country's citizens. To hold them off, the Emperor issues a notice of conscription with the requirement that each Chinese family must contribute one male member to fight back against the invaders. Knowing her ailing father would not stand a chance against this threat, the young and adventurous Hua Mulan (Yifei Liu) decides to go against her family's wishes and take his place, disguising herself as a man and training hard until she is physically ready to do battle with the enemy.Even after more than twenty years, I still feel that the original 1998 film holds up extremely well, thanks to its wonderfully written main character, beautiful hand drawn art style, catchy songs, and universal themes centring on honouring family tradition and standing for the right cause. ""Mulan 2020"", however, simply feels like the current head on this proverbial chopping block of decent-to-mediocre live action adaptations of animated Disney films. Less than ten minutes in, I was taken aback at how soulless and uninteresting this version was. All of the fun moments and lovable quirks that made the original such a joy to watch are jarringly absent here, replaced instead with musicless training montages, generic war battles, bland supporting characters, and a female lead who looked so emotionless that it is hard to determine if she even cares about what is going on around her. I'm not entirely sure if this was all a creative decision to make us take this film more seriously or if it was just a way to compromise the original story to suit Chinese audiences, but considering Disney's business practice of shilling out to China as a means to bring in more box office revenue, I'd be leaning more towards the latter.In terms of direction, there's nothing special here. It's all paint-by-the-numbers in its execution and leaves very little to the imagination. This is somewhat surprising because its director Niki Caro is certainly more than qualified to have handled subject matter like this. Her 2002 film ""Whale Rider"" dealt with the theme of a girl proving herself to be just as worthy as the boys in a leadership role, which certainly echoes similarities to the character of Hua Mulan. Why this couldn't be replicated here is unconfirmed but I am once again inclined to place the blame on Disney's tailoring to Chinese tastes as the main reason.Additionally, the cinematography left a lot to be desired, as it too was relatively unimpressive. Instead of the gorgeous sweeping shots of Ancient China and all its architectural accomplishments seen in the original, there are instead a bland still images with an establishing caption at the bottom of the screen. Epic shots of armies marching towards each other are now replaced with five second cuts of soldiers walking past obvious green screen backgrounds. This made it near impossible for me to be truly immersed into this era as I think it comes across as lazy and cost-cutting (this film had a budget of US$200 million so there's no excuse for this kind of lax approach). I will admit the musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams was one of the few things I actually enjoyed about this film, along with some creative choices in costume design, but that isn't enough to redeem the entire picture from the rest of its faults.The only member of the cast who left something of an impression on me was its main star Yifei Liu in the title role, not because her performance is particularly memorable, but because she is the only character given any real development. Every other member of the supporting cast felt like they were there to either spout exposition or make our heroine look good when a scene required it. I missed the wisecracks of the dragon Mushu and the implied romantic feelings Mulan felt for her Captain in the original, as these gave that film so much more personality and charm. Throughout this film, Mulan's emotions ranged from either looking scared to looking poker faced. Even scenes where she was crying didn't look convincing enough to leave an impact. On a more positive note, I do think she did resemble a man when she was dressed up as one, due to how androgynous some of her fellow cadets looked alongside her, so at least that was believable.In conclusion, it seems kind of pointless to continue complaining about Disney remaking all of their older films in live action as it is going to keep happening regardless. What creative liberties they'll end up taking with each film will vary of course as China has a strict code of practice that needs to be followed. I have created my own quality spectrum for Disney remakes with Mulan 2020 being at the end of the ""Too Different"" side and The Lion King 2019 being on the end of ""Too Similar"" side. If I had to pick a film for the middle, I'd probably say The Jungle Book 2016, as I believe it had the right balance of difference and similarity to its animated counterpart. With that in mind, if Disney remakes stick too closely to either end, I'd say we're in for a bumpy ride over the next few years.I rate it 4/10",Mulan

82,cardsrock,A lifeless retelling,5,7 March 2021,"I'm not someone beholden to the songs and characters in the original Mulan. I was excited Disney was steering away from the shot-for-shot remake trend of their live-action retellings. Unfortunately, they went a bit too far in the other direction and made a generic Chinese fantasy martial arts film. The cinematography is great and the colors are often vibrant, but the story is pretty dull. The lead actress is awfully bland as well. The action and music are standouts, but get bogged down by some pacing issues.My biggest issue with this film though is Mulan herself. Disney has gotten into this awful habit of making their female characters Mary Sues who never struggle or have any character arc (e.g., Rey and Captain Marvel). It's like they don't know how to write female characters, which is insane because it shouldn't be any different than male characters. Mulan in the original was a great character because she used her wits and perseverance to get ahead in a man's world. In this retelling, Mulan is gifted magical powers (?!) from birth and never has to struggle. This movie is almost saying she needs magical powers to be better than men, which is ridiculous. How hard is it to portray female characters that work hard and use ingenuity to advance in society?This film is ultimately joyless and hollow. There's no Will Smith as Genie or stunning CGI to make this remake stand out. What we end up with is a movie that feels like it was made by committee.",Mulan

84,CANpatbuck3664,Technically Well Made But They Completely Missed Why the 1998 Version was so Special,5,1 March 2021,"The 5/10 rating may have tipped you off that I have a more mixed opinion on this movie. I always try and mention the positives which aren't abundant but I'll list them first. The 2020 version of Mulan obviously had the full might of the mouse behind it and the huge budget does show up on screen. The world looks beautiful, the CGI work is largely top notch and the cinematography is largely stunning and eye-catching (save for some iffy editing in the action sequences). This version of Mulan does transport you into the intended place and era and I have few gripes with the movie visually.I'm not going to spend a lot of time on the acting. I don't think there were any amazing or terrible performances, most of them were somewhere in the middle. My favourite was Tzi Ma who at least had some of the compassion required as Mulan's father. I was excited to see Jet Li and Donnie Yen in big supporting roles but both of them are given very little to do and Li especially doesn't have much beyond stoically reading his lines. Li Gong was the next most emotionall but she's not done any favours with the lack of development past the surface pain of her character. I didn't hate Yifei Liu as Mulan but her serious demeanour led to her coming off as wooden. I think it was more her falling in line with the rest of the movie but she didn't have any warmth or vulnerability in her performance.The biggest mistake of this movie is how they change Mulan's character completely. In the animated movie, Mulan is far from competent when her journey begins. She's inexperienced but she's also clumsy and ill suited to what life has been chosen for her. She doesn't have special physical gifts, she endures hardship in her training and nearly fails. Her cunning mind and her determination is what makes her special and she wins over her fellow soldiers with her dedication and her outside the box thinking. She outwits the villain and saves her country through her combined abilities instead of physical prowess. Its her inner strength that's so inspiring and why she's so special among the heroines of Disney animation. I still get goosebumps every time I watch her grab the arrow from the pole and smile when the Emperor bows to her in recognition of her greatness. The movie industry as a whole makes female action heroines cold yet gifted and emotionless robots. Vulnerability is what endears us to the hero's journey. We love them for their FLAWS and THEIR ABILITY TO OVERCOME. Mulan 2020's version isn't vulnerable or doesn't grow from her experience. She's special already because of her Chi, a mystical force she harnesses. This isn't mentioned once or twice, its dropped throughout the movie repeatedly and its a HUGE mistake. Her success isn't earned, its ordained and it undercuts the gravity of journey.There's one more thing I'd like to talk about that the creative team and studio dismissed from the previous version. It may not be the first thing that comes to mind when you remember the animated version but the music/soundtrack from the 1998 Mulan is hugely underrated. Reflection is the musical number that everyone remembers first, its a powerful song about having to hide one's true self and buckling under societies' expectations instead of being true to who you are. But my favourite from the soundtrack is I'll Make a Man Out of You, it may be among my favourite musical numbers period. It not only provides a rousing backdrop for a great training montage, but its reflective of Mulan's evolution and her rising to the occasion. They decided not to use those numbers in this one in service of the ""grounded tone."" This could have been a fine decision if they had featured another part more prominently or hit it out of the park with the orchestral score but it felt like there was something missing when we watched the new interpretations of those now more empty scenes.The failures of Mulan are unique when compared to other live-action Disney adaptations. Unlike the Lion King or Beauty and the Beast, they're not sticking too close to the script or creating a carbon copy of the animated versions. This is like Dumbo where there are lots of changes and unfortunately it creates the opposite effect. They ruin an already great story by messing with the successful formula. There are lots of small complaints I'm not mentioning (the reveal of Mulan being a woman and her defeat of Bori Khan are both pretty laughable) and I'm also just walking right by the fact that the 1998 version is hilarious and this movie's attempts at comedy fall flat. If you've never seen the animated version, hopefully this does for you what the 1998 one does for me. As a die-hard fan of the original, even objectively this movie is a huge mess. I'd never watch it again when the animated one is readily available on streaming platforms right now.",Mulan

It doesn't tell the sad story of Mulan but that wouldn't work for the Disney Demographic. It is like a magic trick that creates the illusion that every thing works out for the best for the protagonist. Whereas the true tale was much grimmer and a Brother's Grimm version would have been more realistic & less offensive to the Chinese culture.It is very westernised in that they tell a traditional Chinese story in English... The acting is ok but it won't win any awards as there is not much to it. The wire work for the stunts are fine but it pales in comparison to the Chinese to Western cross-over films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden dragon, House of flying Daggers that remain classics. This film will be ill remembered. They could have tried to appeal to both Western and Chinese Audiences if they utilized some Chinese with subtitles and mostly English in the film but that would not suit a Disney film.It has a forced ""happy"" ending which I don't buy at all.

Just colorful CGI and wrap it up and throw it out there as people eats everything big companies throw at them. Mulan follows the same disfigured recipe for failure with a boring story, lame non relatable characters, disfigured shadow of the old classic and a drag when it comes to acting.Overall a pointless continuous disaster for the money driven reboots that is not worth wasting time.",Mulan

It mimics Crouching Tiger at times but it just doesn't seem to fit here.
This is written for kids under 16 as anyone older will see all of the mistakes and it is just not that enjoyable.",Mulan
94,baileycrawly,Let's Get Down to Business...,7,25 November 2020,"...except there's no music in this one, so just forget about that. The composer wrote some of the iconic songs into the score, but nobody actually sings in the film, which is a real shame. One of the best things Disney always had going for it was the music that accompanied their films. However, the way the film is set up makes it flow pretty easily without the music. It wold be a little off-putting if, in the environment they established with this film, the characters started singing. So as much as I love the original's songs, I'm okay to go without them in this one.
This film doesn't capture the same spirit as the original, and I think it's unfair for anyone to expect it to. It's not a shot for shot remake like The Lion King was (thank god for that), rather it's a different, more straightforward interpretation of the source material. It's about as inessential as any of the Disney remakes, but that doesn't make it a bad movie.
The acting is a little wooden and the character development is definitely underdone, which is a downside to the film. As I was watching, there were quite a few moments that felt like they needed a little bit more work, a little more quality in the writing. The lead actor isn't particularly strong in the role, lacking believable expression, which is joked about a little bit at the beginning, although I know for a fact they weren't doing it to poke fun at her. It feels like she's definitely trying her best, but there's not enough for her to really work on.
And we need to talk about one of the big controversies in this film: the removal of Mushu. How people found that character lovable or even charismatic is beyond me. Eddie Murphy in Mulan gave nothing more than an early rendition of what would become Donkey. Mushu was the same annoying, loud-mouthed, disposable character as Donkey, and it was a headache to watch his performance. In my review for the original Mulan I tried my best to be level-headed and fair in my discussion on Murphy but now, seeing story work well enough without him, it only drives home how bland he is as an actor and how annoying his character was. He was the goofy ""comic relief"" in the same way Robin Williams was in Aladdin: neither role was particularly ""good"" or ""memorable"" in my personal opinion, but they gave just enough to expand the runtime a little bit. The animated film needed it.
This one did not. As a matter of fact, this Mulan runs about 30 minutes too long. It comes down to fine-tuning the story to best suit your intended audience, which is something that Disney used to be really good at but has really jumped the gun on in recent years. There's nothing at all wrong with longer films, even for children, but the film needs to do something meaningful with that time. There's no point in doing a 2 hour movie if a half-hour of that is pointless exposition (the witch... why?) that really doesn't do a whole lot for the plot. There were a lot of ""check the time"" moments throughout this film.
I think it's easy going into a movie with such heated controversy behind it to view it as a negative thing immediately, even when it's not necessarily warranted. This film is far from perfect, but it needs to be viewed separately from the insurmountable controversies that accompany it (I'm beginning to believe this production was cursed), as well as the source material. As I said, it's not shot-for-shot, it takes the original film, harvests the best of what it had to offer and attempts to add its own flare to the story. Whether it worked or not is entirely up to the individual viewer (with every remake, the responses are going to be particularly divisive), but this one just worked for me. It's far from my favorite Disney movie and it's not something I would regularly watch, but it's also not something I regret paying for. I appreciate the time, effort and hard work the filmmakers put into this movie.",Mulan

It had good pacing, and a nice story and message.I quite liked the character of Mulan, she had enough development and exploration to make her an interesting character to follow for the duration of the film. The rest of the characters weren't particularly explored, so in terms of having a decent supporting cohort Mulan was left wanting.The action I thought was a bit hit and miss. There were some pretty cool and neat set pieces with good stunt work, others where they felt like they were just going through the motions a bit. On balance though I'd say the action was entertaining.What really impressed though was the cinematography. The film looked beautiful, with some stunning landscapes and an excellent use of colour.

100,Mike_Devine,A far fall from the animated classic,4,1 January 2021,"Disney's wild kick of redoing its animated classics as live action films doesn't appear to be slowing down any time soon. 2020's COVID-delayed 'Mulan' is the latest output of this trend, which was met with a very mixed reaction from general audiences.Setting aside the political uproar 'Mulan' unleashed due to filming locations within China, the film lacks any real sense of excitement. Maybe it's the lack of a fun, memorable soundtrack. Maybe it's due to the fact that there's no Eddie Murphy-voiced dragon sidekick. Whatever it is, it's really stark. Sure, the whole ""celebrate your differences"" theme is relevant in this day and age, but it sort of gets in the way of everything else.On the acting front, 'Mulan' features a number of actors who bring a sense of authenticity to the production, led by newcomer Yifei Liu in the titular role. Familiar faces including Donnie Yen and Jet Li bring a sense of comfort to balance out those who are relative unknowns, but this isn't enough to make 'Mulan' feel special. It's really just average on many levels, regardless of how many special effects are thrown in there.A lot of films have been sidetracked by the ongoing pandemic. In the case of 'Mulan,' unfortunately, this is not a case of being ""worth the wait.""",Mulan

Its real horses, real costumes, real buildings.This alone makes Mulan feel more impactful and more graceful then any marvel or starwars today.

103,daisukereds,What a shame.. another change for the worse,3,5 September 2020,"What a TERRIBLE ending.. devoid of everything.
As a stand alone movie, it is nothing but serviceable. Before the final comfrontation, it was just fine.. it quickly nose-dived to absurdity and a lack of devotion to movie making. When compared to the original animation, it is clear that this one pales to the amount of detail and love poured on the first iteration.You can't deny the production value, some great scenes (preparation for Matchmaker) and strong visuals.. specially locations.But yet again, like with Aladdin, changes made to this life action adaptation are a detriment to the original story.
Mulan being able to finally climb the mountain doesn't come from effort or talent. She just does. The infamous Mary Sue syndrome. Can't get a female lead right..Chasing after the Khan alone, as an excuse to face the witch alone (in a secluded place), only for a pointless change of character. And the reveal to the troops, followed by her expulsion means a LOT less when her companions don't know the value of her deeds. No one saw her actions to bring down an avalanche, saving all of them (well, physically saving only one). This is a change for the worse in every way.. and only one example of their tampering.Lessened impact to scenes (reaching the horrors of war), lack of depth without musical tone. Switch between playful life and reality is non existant.Unearned character traits and arcs.And worse of all, the whole ""Join me, we will take our place together"" line.. a touch of Start Wars, to top it all off. With Chi being like the force.This version of Mulan simply gains everything by doing nothing.. unlike the original, where she still acts true to her feelings, by keeping the people in mind and putting REAL effort into her actions.. Even if it means a bigger disgrace.
In this one, she isn't just trusted by a small group, she is basically forgiven. She is suddenly the most important piece on the chestboard.
It isn't properly stablished, that she is on par with the witch.. She just IS their best warrior.
Even taking away from the Khan himself.. everything he accomplishes, it's because of Magic, and a tenues position of power over a Witch that is not credible. And the female antagonist, whose position isn't earned.I expected no less from Disney, but still managed to be disappointed.",Mulan

106,vjnambu,Bad remake as well as an independent film,3,24 September 2020,"I like the animated mulan though, i am not a big fan of it compared to other disney classics. Trailers of the live action mulan gave us a hope that it may be a well made remake but also raised doubts whether this version would be as superior as the original or not. Disney is often in a tricky zone while making a live action remake of their classic coz they would receive flak either for not trying anything new or trying something different by tampering the feel of the original. Mulan 2020 is in the latter position. While jungle book and aladdin tried something different without tampering the feel of the original, mulan here fails completely for the sake of trying different.
The biggest drawback of live action mulan was turning the character of mulan into the chose one aka a superhero. The animated mulan was an ordinary girl who trained hard to become a warrior and gives motivation to women. But this mulan is invincible right from the beginning and trains in the army like a pro. That steals away the real message of the film. Plot is predictable. There is no fun elements for kids to enjoy. There is no thrill in training, action and war sequences. One doesn't get touched in the emotional scenes. The supporting characters are uninteresting. And, finally the lead actress does well in action scenes but gives a very blank performance throughout.
On the whole mulan 2020 is one of the worst live action remakes from disney which made me a fan of the original more. Even if its seen as an independent film too its bad.",Mulan
107,fciocca,"Well directed stunt scenes, visually appealing, but there are many things missing from the original movie",4,8 September 2020,"I kinda enjoyed this live action version of Mulan, action scenes were well directed, I really liked landscapes and costumes and I think that overall the story is entertaining and manages to keep you until the end. Compared to other live-action remakes, I think that this time Disney made overall a decent job, however there are a few things that really bugged me.Some iconic scenes were shorted or completely removed. A lot of key characters were missing. Everything was built around Mulan, that is the only hero. In the original movie Yao, Ling and Chien are essential for the development of the main character. Mushu that is one of the most memorable character in the Disney universe, was completely removed, to be replaced by a phoenix that does not even speak. I highly doubt that Disney did not have the money to create a CGI model. I was waiting for him for the whole movie, but unfortunately he never appeared. I don't expect an exact copy of the original 1998 cartoon, but these things were essential.The acting job of Yifei Liu should be better, there are some scenes where she is decent, but most of the time her interpretation is very flat. This problem extends also to the rest of the cast.I am very surprised that Disney with access to all this technology cannot create something nice and that almost every original movie is still better than these live action remakes. These movies are very good from a technical perspective, but from a narration point of view are awful. In my opinion this company should focus on creating new stories with new characters, leaving behind classics, that are already good.",Mulan

None of the characters make any bonds that are emotion, and the lifeless acting certainly doesn't help.The action is also really bad. It tries to copy Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon's combat, but it doesn't work nearly as well. It's also poorly edited, with tons and tons of unnecessary jump cuts.And that's about it. There's nothing more to talk about because this movie offers nothing interesting. It's just really bland and predictable, so I'm giving it a 3/10.

Overall rating 94/100Mulan is a live action adaptation/remake of the Disney classic Mulan, which is based on a young woman of the same name who takes the place of her injured father to fight in the Chinese army to bring honour to her family. I have to say this live action remake from Disney has to be one of my favourites due it actually being able to stand on its own without the original movie, so let's get started.First of all the cinematography, set pieces and action were just fantastic. This movie was absolutely visually captivating and took my breath away in multiple occasions. The long shots of the sets and filming locations were beautiful and the movie really let the beauty of the story world and sets sink in for the audience which I loved. The set pieces were also visually creative for the action sequences and beautifully either created or reimagined. The action sequences were also fantastic, this movie genuinely had some of the most creative and entertaining action sequences that I have ever seen, I was never bored and constantly in awe and on the edge of my seat, It reminded me a lot of the house of flying daggers which I absolutely loved.My next few positives would be the villains, nostalgia chemistry between characters and the added plot. I thought that both of the villains had great and clear intentions set up for the movie and for the most part were better constructed than in the original, the movie set up their motivations and goals well for both characters making the audience understand what they wanted out of their attacks, and both of their action sequences were fantastic especially Li Gong who was fantastic as the witch. I also loved the chemistry between the different characters and actors, the movie elaborated more on the connection between Mulan and her father which I Thought was excellent, it raised the stakes of her actions well, and it kept some of the heart of the original with how close they were on screen. I loved how nostalgic the movie still was, they still managed to capture a lot of the great scenery and scenes of the original really well, with the score of reflection working really well at creating an atmospheric tone and nostalgia giving me goosebumps. But what I loved about the movie was the added plot and how it is it's own movie by itself. The movie had so much added characters and developed themes and great new story world it felt like its own movie instead of a shot for shot remake which I absolutely loved, the movies more serious tone compared to the originals more humorous tone also worked very well for what they were going for.My few negatives for the movie would be the slightly generic main villain, me missing some of the old elements, and there being some unnecessary character conflict. I thought that the male antagonist was slightly generic and over the top, unlike the female antagonist he didn't really have a satisfying character arc and lacked the same amount of depth as the female villain. Although the new added plot elements were great I did find myself missing some of the old characters and humour from the original, I also thought that there was some unnecessary conflict between Mulan and the other soldiers in training, it would have been nice to have more of a tighter friendship between them all and I felt like conflict was created just because they could.My next few positives would be the new characters, as well as fun and likeable characters, as well as its better more in-depth themes. I loved the new characters added to the movie, the female antagonist was an excellent addition to the movie, her action sequences were fantastic and she created great conflict more Mulan and the male antagonist, and some of the male soldiers were also a lot of fun on screen as well. I also loved that the movie went deeper with its themes. I felt like the movie handled the themes of Bravery, family and honour fantastically and in more depth than the original animated film, this was due to the script and added stakes within the movie making it more powerful.My final few positives would be the fantastic character arcs for Mulan and the female antagonist as well as a fantastic final act. I thought the character arc for Mulan was excellent, I thought it was much better constructed, Mulan had more challenges to overcome and more people to prove of her power and worthiness and it was just powerfully done it made her more of an inspiring character, I also found the character arc for the female antagonist really interesting, she was very similar to Mulan in terms of being an outcast and people not accepting her they just took different parts, but for Mulan to convince her that change is possible was very well done. And finally the final act was just fantastic, it had all the best elements of movie in one, fantastic cinematography and action sequences, satisfying character arcs and themes, I was entertained throughout.Overall, despite perhaps not having quite as much charm as the original film. This is one of Disney's stronger live action remakes, with so much visual and action creativity, and a better constructed themes and characters that make the story powerful and hold well on it's own without comparisons to the original.",Mulan

114,deepfrieddodo,"This Is Not The Animation, Have An Open Mind",7,13 September 2020,"I see that many reviews are berating this film for not following the animation more, but instead of hoping for a frame-by-frame reshoot like The Lion King, I would say have an open mind going into this. After all, I doubt the original Chinese legend had Eddie Murphy in mind to play a role. I haven't seen the 1998 animation, so I cannot draw comparison.The film starts a little slow, but bare with it, after about half an hour it kicks in. It's refreshing to see a cast purely of the ethnicity intended for the story, rather than having one Westerner to play a key role to the plot. Scenery is impressive and worth a mention for the visual appreciation it can cause. There are cheesy moment in there for sure, and some of the acrobatics can be on the borderline too. Having not grown up with this type of cinema apparent in my culture, it can be easy to scoff at some of the 'stunts', flipping up everything possible and frequently running up walls, and to be fair, at times the way these are shot are a little cringe-worthy. However, this is a way of bringing Eastern and Western cinema together, incorporating important elements of each type of film.You may not like this film because there is no dragon, it isn't a musical, and a witch has been added (somewhat unnecessarily), but you have to appreciate that this is ultimately a Disney film. This is for children to enjoy. It's great that another culture is given the limelight, with a cast (mostly) unknown outside of Eastern cinema. Give kids something a little different to watch, and see what they think of it, instead of trashing a film based on your childhood memories.",Mulan

116,movieman6-413-929510,The live-action Mulan is more boring and serious compared to the animation.,5,7 September 2020,"Mulan is a live-action adaptation of the animated movie of the same name and can be seen on Disney +. The film is directed by Niki Caro, the director of Whale Rider and The Zookeeper's Wife.In the film, the Chinese Empire is attacked by a rebellious Rouran army led by Böri Khan (Jason Scott Lee), who receives help from a witch Xianniang (Li Gong). The Chinese emperor asks each family to send a man to join the Chinese army, so that they can fight the enemy army. Because Mulan (Yifei Liu) her father is the only man in her family and he cannot join the army due to his old age and shortcomings, Mulan decides to pretend to be a man and enlist in the army. Here she has to hide the fact that she is actually a woman, in order to keep the honor of her family. For example, she starts training undercover to support the Chinese army and in the hope of remaining in control of the rebels.Director Niki Caro and cinematographer Mandy Walker have portrayed the film in a beautiful way. The Asian culture is clearly shown in the film. The film beautifully shows the mountainous areas in China. Apart from the beautiful images, the film is unfortunately not that special. The problem is more with the script, how the film tells its story and how they put it all together.
Unlike the animation, Mulan in this movie doesn't really need to train herself to become a real warrior. As a result, her character lacks the structure that the same character had in the animation. In this film they try to bring out more that women, just like men, can also be warriors for the army. Despite the good intentions of this post, the script and how they bring Mulan up from the beginning also let it go.
To make this movie a bit more respectful to the Chinese audience, they kept the popular character of Mushu, who was voiced by Eddie Murphy, out of the live-action verse. By removing this character, the film loses many of the comedic moments that the animation does have and this film comes across a bit too serious and becomes more long-winded.Unfortunately, the effects also come across a bit frayed in the film, so you can see where they used CGI or a green screen.Unfortunately, the characters are not that special in the film. Most of them play the soldiers of the Chinese army, but are not really developed further in the film except for a few moments. Yifei Liu does portray the role in a fun way in the film, but due to the lack of structure of her character, she does not come forward that much. Donnie Yen knows how to provide some small comedic moments as the commander of the Chinese army, but he has also done better and more comical acting in his other films.This movie can be seen on Disney + at a rather high price, which the movie is actually not worth. For a better version, stick with the animated movie or wait for the movie to be seen for free on Disney + later this year if you have a subscription.",Mulan

This is a grand epic that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen you can find. The battle sequences are breathtaking. The cinematography is gorgeous. However, the main reason to watch is the superb central performance by Liu Yifei. I was fully immersed in this version of the famous Chinese folk tale.",Mulan
123,Hallelujah289,"Gorgeous, risk-taking, but stunted",6,3 October 2020,"An undeniably beautiful cinematic experience, with rich colors, expansive shots, and a very gorgeous young lady who plays Mulan with depth and conviction. In addition, some refreshing (but not altogether effective) departures from the animated Disney film on which it is based makes Mulan one of the better Disney remakes yet, on par with last year's Aladdin, or better than it.Both Aladdin and Mulan attempt to weave in darker tones from the harsher ancient times they take from. I commend this about the films. Darkness does have a place in children's films. However both films try to mesh the impossible: gritty historical accuracy and a modern idealistic sense of female empowerment in famously patriarchal societies. What emerges are tales that are perfect in the writing, but missing emotional impact and believability because of how little resistance the female protagonists have to meet to gain their recognition. Especially true of Jasmine in the Aladdin remake, and fortunately less true of Mulan, however, Mulan suffers from the same OP (overpowerment) skills as Rei in Disney's Star Wars series. It's not much fun rooting for an underdog who doesn't have to try very hard.In this iteration, Mulan has a natural ""chi"" since childhood. She has near superhuman reflexes and ability. When she has to decide to go to battle instead of her father, why should she be afraid? As Mulan herself says, where is the courage without the fear?This Mulan remake is a good step forward for Disney to take on slightly more risks since Aladdin, giving Mulan actual enemy soldiers to kill at points, which was surprising. However, I hope that Disney can finally decide who its audience is going to be: is this a movie for kids who liked ""Frozen,"" or for the adults who grew up with the animated Disney originals, but who now watch ""Game of Thrones""? I believe that there is an in-between such as ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" however for me Disney has yet to adequately find it.Again, I do applaud Disney for its risk taking, but I do have to say the animated film is better because the Mulan of that film had more room to grow. I don't want the remakes to be the same as their counterparts, but I won't give a 10/10 like others have for a film that takes some small risks, and then backtracks with other compromises of more of the same.Gong Li's witch character wasn't really necessary or believable (she is the most non evil witch ever), but I think in the end her addition continued the legacy established by ""Frozen"" of meaningful female sacrifice. Something of a retread, but not unappreciated in a film otherwise without very much true high stakes.",Mulan
124,TheVictoriousV,A gorgeous bore; not worth any party's trouble,3,2 December 2020,"The year was 2019. Early reactions to Disney's next big thing, a Mulan remake that actually showed signs of being more than a 3D rehash (Gasp!), went exactly as you think (and were hardly the end to the film's backlash). Here was an opportunity to retell an Eastern folk tale without copying off an already existing screen version for nostalgia points, and Disney took it by giving the 2020 Mulan film sort of a Kurosawa aesthetic, subtracting its songs and anthropomorphic dragons.Thus, the infants-at-heart who usually approve of Disney remakes were throwing Facebook comment tantrums over something relatively new being put before them. And I agree that doing something new isn't inherently good; this one's less of a downgraded clone à la Beauty and the Beast and more of a fan-fic à la Maleficent. It still isn't an improvement.Disney's original Mulan (1998) was loved for ostensibly being a progressive victory, not only because of how it translated Hua Mulan's impersonation of an imperial soldier into a more ""topical"" defiance of gender roles. I imagine it also had to do with the Chinese representation, even if this wasn't quite true of its cast.The remake gets representation down better in that sense, but falls short of the loveable characterizations (and reportedly fails to depict the culture itself). Yifei Liu plays Mulan, Donnie Yen portrays Commander Tung, Jet Li is the Emperor, and there's also the likes of Li Gong, Yoson An, Tzi Ma, Rosalind Chao, and even Jimmy Wong of Video Game High School. One of the non-Chinese performers (in the sense that he also shares Hawaiian genes) is Jason Scott Lee as the leader of the Rourans. Perhaps Disney figured that, since Scott is ""hard to place"" ethnically, we may believe Proto-Mongols looked like this.So, is this indeed a more serious and less child-friendly take on the Mulan legend? In many ways, yes, but since it needs to score high with modern audiences (which can be extra tricky when your film doesn't spoonfeed the Disnoids as many member berries as The Lion King), it's also more in-your-face with how it translates the legend into a message in opposition of gender norms and sexism.This comes at the expense of Mulan's endearing awkwardness and evolution into a formidable fighter in her own right (I find that fans of Carol Denvers and Rey Palpatine have an easier time grasping why this is a problem when they have an actually-struggling female role model to compare the infallible action figure to). Here, the bird witch says there's simply something special about her. Yes, the bird witch.Alas, I don't know how high this will score with anyone anymore. The initial Coronavirus cases, alongside Yifei Liu's political comments, didn't do wonders for the remake's chances of making bank in China. And the domestic ""PC crowd"" also seemed displeased despite the progressive gender commentary; there's no Captain Shang for Mulan to fall for while in her male soldier disguise, erasing the bi representation that (apparently) was in the original - so much for the ""woke"" intent of avoiding #MeToo parables. Obviously, it didn't help that American crowds (or any crowds) no longer gather at the multiplex.The movie is finally out as an overpriced Disney+ item, making it even more unattractive. Disney so badly wanted this to succeed, yet lost all their faves; Chinese filmgoers, progressive audiences (who are only becoming more and more cognizant that ""woke"" films can still be bad since the Charlie's Angels fiasco), and the metathesiophobic fans. But some people from within these demos will no doubt see this dour remake and think it's mostly time well spent, especially for its visuals - when it doesn't cut too quickly for anything to be meaningfully visible, anyway. Not sure I can say the same about the money.",Mulan

127,namob-43673,Great entertaining family movie,8,7 September 2020,"This is a very good movie. Probably the best I have seen so far this year. Not that there is much competition unfortunately, but still.The bad?
Only cinematic issue I had was the sound design. Felt off somehow. Perhaps they filmed it in several languages or something and a lot of the fights and explosions and such do not hit the mark. This is the only really bad thing about the movie; the sound design.
Mulan is also a bit too Disney-ish sometimes. There is no blood, no real danger, and if you have seen the animated original there is nothing really new. I also think they could have done a little better with some fight scenes and perhaps a couple of actors were not spot on.BUT, with that said;The good!
Almost everything else. This is just as funny as the original. Great characters. Great story. Great acting. Great directing. Great cinematography (except sound design and a few fight scenes). This is a great family movie. Despite some violence, the Disney-ish with no blood etc make this a great watch for the whole family.I really enjoyed this movie. It is not perfect, but its entertaining and fun from start to finish. Loved every second of it. If they'd nailed the sound design, put more effort into the fight scenes and exchanged perhaps 1 or 2 actors, I would already state that this is the best movie of the year. Unfortunately they did not, but this is still best I have seen so far 2020.A strong 8/10 and I highly recommend.",Mulan
128,spasek,A Simply Fun and Delightful Remake...the Best Disney Has Done Yet!,8,7 January 2021,"Whether it's prejudice or blindness, I find it ironic that most of the negative reviews come from people who are unable to give legitimate reasons or examples. This usually means that you have ""reviewers"" posting negative reviews simply for the sake of it. Such people are not reviewers at all.Mulan is easily the best live-action ""remake"" that I have seen yet. In many ways, as other true reviewers have pointed out, it's more of a reimagining. The main storyline is left intact, for the most part, and the liberties taken are done mostly to enhance the story rather than detract from it.Mulan is a Disney film with a rather serious tone--not unlike the Hunchback of Notre Dame--that seeks to point out the irrevocable balance between men and women, and to encourage young girls and women to embrace their power rather than reject it due to some male ego-driven idea that women should be subservient by ""knowing their place."" Only cowards and very small minded people consider this a threat.The central core of Mulan is to be true to who you are. This is a universal message. Stop trying to be something you are not. And it is ironic that one of Mulan's enemies is the one to help her see this truth.The acting performances are first-rate across the board. The actino sequences are excellent, reminding me of a combination of ""Crouching TIger, Hidden Dragon"" as well as ""Iron Monkey."" Sure, some scenes will likely leave you scratching your heads, but in the end, you just have to go with it.The only thing I wish that Disney would have done--and I understand that their primary audience is an American one--is to leave the Chinese language intact. The movie would have been all-the-more powerful and significant had the characters been able to speak Chinese. However, with many children as the target audience, I can see why this wouldn't be feasible. However, as an ESL teacher, who has taught in China, I can tell you that Chinese children and others pick up English even more quickly when they watch English-speaking films.I was not impressed with Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, or Lion King, so I had a high-level of skepticism going in, but I was pleassantly surprised. Mulan is a fun film for all ages, and the wisdom it imparts is timeless!So, do yourself a favor. Stop looking at the reviews (positive or negative) and judge for yourself without the typical prejudices going into it. I have typically found that over 70% of reviews posted are baseless and meaningless. Especially here on IMDB.",Mulan
129,kevinxirau,This brought dishonor to us all.,4,13 June 2021,"In recent years, Disney made a big push towards nostalgic properties. While there have been some successes, much of the material they released has been met with increasing criticism, especially with their live-action remakes. When I saw the trailer for ""Mulan"", I was enthusiastic given that the original is an old favorite of mine. Sadly, circumstances were not in its favor: critics and fans alike tore into it, the socio-political climate surrounding its release in the US and China was terrible, misleading promoting, and the absurd Disney+ price at the time. Hearing this negativity made me reluctant to see this remake, but as a fan and a film enthusiast I felt obligated to do so. Is it as bad as everyone says it is?Positives: Visuals are lovely, some striking color and environments from Mulan's circular home to an icy sulfur lake. The action scenes are okay, mixing martial arts with chi this time, allowing stunts straight out of classic kung fu films, this time with more blatant, albeit bloodless, deaths (though the editing could be better). A new character I like is Mulan's quasi love interest Chen Honghui, who brought a lot of positivity and was very accepting even before her gender reveal. Mulan's relationship with her father is serviceable, a must if she was to head out to be a soldier in his place. The soundtrack is a pleasure to hear, especially the musical rendition of ""Reflection"". There's also a wonderful cameo by Ming-Na Wen, the OG Mulan, which did get me little giddy.Negatives: I had trouble connecting with this Mulan. She lacks expressions much of the time and her line delivery is off. She doesn't struggle nearly as much being already so talented and powerful due to her chi and she's accepted by her underdeveloped peers almost right away. Her conflict is more about dealing with repressing herself to avoid suspicion than earning her skills and respect while maintaining cover. This might work with a little tweaking, but her lack of flaws and real challenges make her not as compelling as her old incarnation, who relied more on wit and ingenuity. She never really builds a bond with the soldiers and often trains alone, not that she needs to given that she's better than them. Also, there are stunts she does that just look ridiculous like her habit of kicking objects/weapons with uncanny proficiency. In place of the intimidating Shan Yu is Bori Khan, who, while motivated by revenge rather than conquest and is shown to be cunning at times, is fairly bland as a villain. The witch serving him is meant to parallel Mulan, but, despite a nice backstory, she's poorly done as her methods/motivation made little sense. She also brings to question the nature of chi; it's basically life energy, but the witch shape-shifts and possesses people, not something it does in philosophy and other depictions. Might as well be magic. The way chi is explained is inconsistent as multiple characters give conflicting descriptions. Replacing Mushu is a phoenix aka fenghuang, which has no personality nor does it truly interact with Mulan (could've been cut out). Jet Li as the emperor is cool yet he seems to be dubbed over with a terrible voice. There's some bad writing like how the witch reveals the villain's plot to Mulan while on opposite sides, the matchmaking incident being more everyone else's fault than Mulan's, and how the rescue in the avalanche is handled. This extends to the film's messages, which go against everything the animated version and the legend stood for. Don't expect songs this time around because there are none, only half-hearted references to them.Mulan 2020 isn't quite as bad as I thought it would be. There were things I liked that made it a bit more uplifting to watch. It's certainly a better remake than the 2019 Lion King, which is just a lifeless copy-and-paste. That said, the problems really do hold it back much like Mulan did to herself. Maybe it's nostalgia or public opinion influencing me, but there's a reason why the first movie is so iconic and this one so despised.",Mulan
130,drunken_munki,Worse than expected,3,7 September 2020,"The animated Mulan movie was a little flawed but an interesting film with beautiful drawings, and humour. This movie is none of these things, replace any theme in the original instead with 'Chi' aka the force, new made up characters, Mulan is now mean who plays tricks on her 'sister' (was there even a sister in the original?), disobeys anyone older or wiser than her and is a general moron.The spirit woman and the army invading the lands don't make any sense in this movie and the backdrop of war and the loss of life is completely lost in this version.There are lots of close up shots of the way of life and costumes, etc, but nothing original added for this film. This is basically an otherwise generic Chinese action film and strip away the title you wouldn't have known. This is a core failing of the writing team and the production as a whole.The visuals are pretty poor, which is bizarre given the reach of Disney, it looks like poorly composted blue screen footage, especially the spiritual stuff/ghosts/transforming forms. In addition the lighting is poor, despite the colours showing through sometimes. There happens to be way too much fake 'HDR' filter rubbish all over the footage, making everything that little more dull and hard to see.Where is Eddie Murphy or the Mushu dragon character? They went out of their way to add old world/new age 'chi' garbage into this film but they cant add the cute little dragon family ancestor?Also now it is a phoenix flapping about the wind as a vision that disappears... who cares? Enough, view at your own risk and burden your wallet at your own discretion.I give it a 3/10 as a less than average disappointing and somewhat aggravating watch.",Mulan

In the case of the new Watership Down series, although the animation was quite poor, I kept on watching because the story and the characters were fascinating and I really cared about them all.In the case of this - the lead actress was wooden (Gong Li, who is brilliant in this, should have been cast as Mulan instead) and her journey was uninspiring - with the writers making her an Avenger with little time to get to know her, rather than a normal girl who triumphs over all physical and social opposition.Please, just give me a Disney remake I can sink my teeth into, that makes me feel wondrous and fulfilled by the end.

Addressing a couple of what seem to be controversial issues:
1) I think Disney should be applauded for ditching the Disney Prince scenario and making Mulan's romantic interest a fellow soldier and basing that interest on his character, values and integrity (instead of wealth/power/social position), though undoubtedly looks still help - as they do in real life to those who cannot see beneath the surface.
2) we need to learn to distinguish between the Chinese culture and ordinary people - which resemble the rest of us but with fascinating differences - and the Chinese political leadership - which tragically appears to be drifting back towards a totalitarianism that we do not wish to resemble in any way, ever!",Mulan
136,XhoXhuXhamen,"Crouching Tiger, Obvious Flop",1,15 May 2021,"This Disney Produced martial arts fantasy farce is everything that the original was not. In other words, It sucked!Whereas the original Mulan, circa 1998, had both a memorable plot and characters, this version was slow, boring, and void of appreciable performances by the cast. I don't mean to pick on Liu Yifei because she's a lovely young woman. But whatever skills she possesses as an actress seemed to disappear when the director, Nikki Caro, said ""Roll Em!"".I'm sure that Disney will blame the C-19 Debacle on this film's poor performance at the box office. But screenplay, editing, and acting were, and are, the real culprits for the end result.As it is, the story of a young girl pretending to be her ailing warrior father to help save their lands from destruction by the evil Rourans is far fetched enough.

Which is Good,8,13 September 2020,"As one who loved the animated version of Mulan, I can fully say that this is not a remake as many other recent Disney live actions have been... which is a good thing!To those that are unaware, Mulan is an actual Chinese legend. To make this solely a remake of the animated classic, and not its own take would be a dishonour on the legend, a dishonour to the Chinese, and a dishonour to your cow (see what I did there). They are of course similar in many ways, and there are nods to the animated film, such as subtle music queues which are appreciated, but to be clear this is very much its own movie.The scenery and sets are visually captivating. The colours are vibrant with both the costumes and the set pieces. The acting has its flaws, but the passion from the actors is real, and it feels like everyone bought in to their roles. Mulan's father is a strong point as he convincingly displays a wide range of emotions.I enjoyed this film. It has its corny moments, but keep in mind this is a Disney family film, so it's to be expected. Those that criticize for it not being scene for scene like the animated version, or that Disney is pushing a feminism agenda again, are either missing the point or not watching the movie.",Mulan
139,arabnikita,Better than Lion King but still full of flaws and inconsistencies,6,5 September 2020,"After the horrendous Lion King, I didn't have any expectations for yet another unnecessary Disney adaptation. Luckily, Mulan wasn't one of the Disney animations that I was obsessed with as a kid so i barely remembered the plot and it almost felt like a new film.Imagine a person painting a palace. At first, it looks splendid with a balanced use of colors and beautiful backgrounds. The painter is no Da Vinci but the work is formidable and we can see it coming into shape. Then all of a sudden, the painter feels like she is running out of time so she just dumps the remaining paint onto the canvas. Before handing it in, she desperately adds a few final touches to try and bring out her initial intentions. This is what watching Mulan felt like.Disney took the understandable direction of scrapping the songs and most of the goofy stuff in an attempt to make a Chines-epic instead of a copy paste of the original. Three quarters into it, I flet good about the characters and the atmosphere. Liu Yifei was great in her organic portrayal of a strong heroine without forcing anything whether through action or dialogue. Then everything became a crazy Kung Fu movie as the pace turned up 300% and all the build up and consistency were tossed away in favor of action and forced messaging. They did try to patch it up in the end but the spirit was lost.Mulan is an ok film to watch as it looks good, has pleasant characters, a bit of jokes and good messages. Unfortunately, these Disney adaptations can't decide if they are proper films or animations where things can happen without logic and characters can evolve in a split second for reasons unknown to humankind. Mulan was a perfect opportunity to scrap all magic and crazy acrobatics to just have a wholesome movie that could be enjoyed by all ages. Sadly, we get another kids film but this one has no joyful songs or sweet gimmicks.Movies.shmovies on Instagram",Mulan
140,hunter-friesen,"More Realistic, Less Fun",6,27 September 2020,"For over a decade now, Disney has been mining their animated catalog of magical stories and remaking them into live-action movies. This trend has had its ups (the visual spectacle found within ""The Jungle Book"") and its downs (last year's joylessly photorealistic ""The Lion King""), but each one has made buckets of money for the house of mouse.Originally set to join the line of remakes back in March was ""Mulan"". For obvious pandemic reasons, that release didn't go as planned and now the film has been released straight to Disney+ at the exorbitant fee of $29.99, which is on top of your regular monthly payments. It's a price point no one should come close to thinking of paying, especially considering that the movie they are buying pales in comparison to its animated predecessor.If you've seen the original 1998 version of ""Mulan"", then you've already seen this newer adaptation as the story follows the same path.The film opens in Imperial China as we are introduced to Mulan, a young adventurous girl that is often a disappointment because she does not fit her predestined gender role. In this opening sequence, we are dazzled with all the things money can buy. At a budget of $200 million, it's no surprise that the sets are luscious, the costumes are pristine, and the makeup is vibrant.Further illustrating the power of money is the locations used by director Niki Caro and cinematographer Mandy Walker. The duo beautifully gives life to the rural and urban landscapes, even if some moments can be ruined by an overabundance of computer effect meddling.After an invasion by the villainous Böri Khan, the emperor conscripts an army made up of one man per family. Unfortunately for Mulan's family, the only man is their war-wounded father who surely will not survive. Under the cover of night, Mulan takes her father's gear and sets out in his place for the army. Upon reaching the training grounds, we are introduced to the lot of supporting characters, first of which is Commander Tung. The rest of the gang are younger lads that only possess one character trait to set them apart.The training sequence is where Caro exemplifies her chops as a director. She creates bold imagery that gives off a sense of power and courage. Caro also injects a bit of wuxia (a Chinese action genre that suspends physics in favor of more fantastical action) into the action. Even if it is over-edited, the stunt work is something to admire as elaborate set pieces are constructed in various interesting locations.And while it's no ""I'll Make a Man Out of You"", composer Harry Gregson-Williams does deliver a terrifically epic score to punctuate the action scenes.What clouds over this newest version of ""Mulan"" and negates many of its accomplishments is the shocking lack of fun within the movie. Stripping itself of the musical numbers and talking animals, and then adding on a dour tone about warfare doesn't make for a very inspirational or entertaining time. Of course, a war movie doesn't have to be all sunshine and rainbows, but it's next to impossible to take this movie seriously when there's an identical bright, animated version that's superior in nearly every way.Chinese star Yifei Lu plays the titular character with both grace and ferocity. She expertly tackles the language barrier and carries the majority of the film's emotional weight on her shoulders. Her interactions with her father (brilliantly played by Tzi Ma) are the highlights.Playing a new character in the story is Gong Li as the conflicted witch Xianniang. She's as mysterious as the dark side of the moon and often toes the line between hero and villain with her inventive powers. It's a shame that she and Jason Scott Lee's Böri Khan were given little to work with.Chinese megastars Donnie Yen and Jet Li play Commander Tung and Emperor, respectively. Yen and Li lend star power to their minor supporting roles, which was probably the only reason they were cast.The newest version of ""Mulan"" is a passable film that fares better than most of the assembly line remakes that have preceded it. But at the same time, it still falters to the original and lacks the entertaining bite that has never been in short supply within Disney films. At the high price required to view it, the best option would be to wait until Dec. 4, when the movie is available at no extra cost to Disney+ subscribers.",Mulan

The magic of the 1998 classic was missing, not just because Mushu and the music were absent, but because the plot itself was completely misconstrued. The ""qi"" power that Mulan possesses makes the whole purpose of her journey fall flat. After finishing the movie, I just wanted to go back and enjoy the original.",Mulan

It does lack some of the humor that was abundant in the animated version. The acting is decent throughout, but I did find Jet Li' portrayal of the emperor a bit mechanical.

Disney is in the entertainment business and so if there's a market for this then who am I to criticize their business strategy. But, being from the US it's not what I would expect and not nearly the entertainment standard I would expect. It's more like something made overseas, dubbed but not translated for cultural differences and expectations. Lost in translation. How do you measure that? I don't know but judging from the feedback from audiences so far, disney doesn't either or they didn't test in the US or they made this for chinese audiences. My kids are grown now but when they were little I didn't think twice about taking them to see the original. But, if they were that age now, I wouldn't let them watch.

147,BabelAlexandria,Mulan without Mushu is NOT like Aladdin without Genie,9,24 April 2021,"This is one of several Disney live-action remakes that depart significantly from the earlier animated movie. But that's ok: as a quick trip to wikipedia suggests, both are among the numerous interpretations of this Tang-dynasty era poem; neither seems to be more ""authentic"" than the other, if that is a worthwhile criterion of comparison in the first place. My kids liked this version better, while I preferred the animated one, but only slightly.The landscapes are spectacular, and represent a real improvement over the animation, even in the representation of the avalanche; though people were absolutely right to protest the filming in Xinjiang. Mushu would have been difficult to transfer to live action, and goes against the film's general lack of humor; so I respect the use of an understated phoenix (or as Sebastian called it, a ""bird dragon"") instead. The lack of original songs was more of a problem, and, contra the director's assertion, singing was very much a part of war. The introduction of the witch fighting on the side of the Rouran army was interesting, though her costume was a shameless rip off of Empire of the Sun videos. Weird. That gave this film a strong emphasis on female solidarity entirely absent from the animated version, which is about Mulan's acceptance by men.Sienna's Rating: 9 stars

148,hoernkeem,"Mulan (2020, Niki Caro) While the cast is impressive they suffer in a rather simple plot that isn't as dynamic as the animated classic",5,28 June 2021,"With the slew of live action Disney remakes along comes 'Mulan' which had been planned as a live action film as far back as 2010. Production stalled for the better part of a decade although the film was finally completed and released in 2020 just in time to be blindsided by the COVID-19 pandemic. It had a brief run in theaters but was eventually released on the Disney+ streaming service in September of 2020. This film retraces the story, for the most part of the animated Disney film notably leaving out the musical numbers as well as the animal sidekick Mushu. The film is directed by Niki Caro, who is from New Zealand, and made a name for herself with 'Whale Rider' back in 2002. She did do 'McFarland, USA' for Disney in 2015 which how she probably wound up on the radar for this project as Disney likes to use mouse house talent when it can. Although Caro is a woman the project did receive criticism for not having a director of Asian descent.In Imperial China a young girl Mulan is anything but what her family considers appropriate. She is impetuous and adventurous and the last thing she wants is to be proper much to her family's dismay. Elsewhere there is a horde of raiders that threaten the land led by a supernatural despot and his witch consort. The Emperor puts out a call for one man from each family to serve and fight. Mulan has no brothers forcing her ailing father to answer the call. Before that can happen though Mulan steals his armor and goes in his stead pretending to be a boy. Mulan is accepted and trusted but in a fight is forced to reveal her identity. At first she is shunned, but when she stumbles onto a secret plan to attack the Emperor and she returns to her battalion to warn them. This leads to a climactic battle between the forces of good and evil where the witch sacrifices herself for Mulan and Mulan, in turn, is able to vanquish the horde's leader and save the Emperor bringing honor upon herself and her family.Many who are fans of the animated classic will probably abhor the changes, and there are those in China who criticize its inaccuracies with their culture and legends. In this wide world you are certainly not going to please everybody. I am not an avid fan of the animated movie so I am not vexed at the changes one way or the other. This does keep the basic heart of what the animated classic is. It adds some fun, special effects heavy fighting sequences which are entertaining enough even if they are a bit vanilla for the Disney family audience. The witch seemed like an odd addition to the story who didn't really serve a strong function other than to give the antagonists a female presence as well and a counterpoint to Mulan herself.This movie winds up being okay. It doesn't do anything in the new and original material to elevate itself at all. It tries to amplify the fight scenes and in that it exceeds to a certain degree, but those scenes aren't enough to give it any more of a wow factor. Disney seems single minded in their attempts to remake every animated film they possess and thus far the best I have seen of those have hewed close to the source material while finding ways to amplify original content making the thing feel both nostalgic and new at the same time. This 'Mulan' does not do enough with its originality to make it something special or new. Ultimately a simply adequate film which doesn't really do anything bad or wrong, but at the same time doesn't do much grand, special or distinctive. If anything it makes me want to revisit the animated film.Eric's Grade: C.",Mulan

As always the wire-fu is unappealing ( except for the Matrix films ). Mushu and the original breathtaking and soaring Mulan score are sorely missed.

To enrich it all, there are bad special effects (VFX and CGI) followed by one of the worst editing ever seen, where it keeps focusing on useless elements of the plot making the result confusing and making the film worse than it is.

However it's surprising and good to see Jet Li acting again, although he is heavily made up and has very little action. I don't even recognize him until late in the movie.It's a typical Disney movie, so some magical stuff are added. This also creates a small role for Gong Li. Some of the story line are hard to believe, like how could a girl pass as a man, or that the family did nothing after she ran off.The main actress is a new face to me. She's fine, though I suspect the real Mulan (if there ever was one) was a lot more musculine. This would help explain how she could pass as a man and not caught.Many Chinese may criticize the movie for this and that. But so far this is the best and only Mulan movie.

Didn't really have that classic Disney magic, very much physics defying stunts, and most of all, a lacklustre emotional story. Whilst I do understand that this film was made for the general public who might care more for the theatrics than the emotional side of the story, I believe that the emotional story really is an untapped potential of this film.Personally, I found this film to be more comedy than any other genre, though it was probably due to the atmosphere I was watching it in. Sitting with my family and watching this film, being able to critique each and everything that happens without being shushed by other movie goers will definitely be a fond memory of mine that I have made. Whilst there were many mistakes in this film, I believe that the cast is not one of them. The acting was superb. With a better execution, this film would have probably been an amazing film.Hence, I will say that while this film has had many mistakes, for the general public, you might not find it so bad. Also, I'd definitely recommend this as a film for the family to have fun and bond in this tough times for this film simply gives you so much ammunition for critique.

Sometimes it can describe the true (who knows the truth?) history, other times can be pure fiction and why not it can be a part, fiction and another part, history. A movie can be everything, because it's a movie! Why your tiny brains can't understand that? Based on true facts, then it should describe true facts, but a movie is great because the things can change. Do you want to learn the history by watching a movie? Read a history book instead of watching a movie!When you read ""based on the novel"", it doesn't mean that it has to describe the facts as they are depicted in the book, something yes, but maybe something could be different, the end can be something you can't expect. You have read that book and in the end you might give the movie a low score, because you remember that the end was different or some characters weren't in the book... your score has to be given to the movie, actors, direction and so on, not whether it described the facts as in the book that it was based on.Mulan is really enjoyable and it's recommended to everyone.

167,isaacsundaralingam,"There is some technical substance, but with absolutely no charm or emotion",3,29 March 2021,"2020's Mulan has absolutely nothing on the original, let's get that out of the way. And quite honestly, the tonal seriousness this adaptation was willing to take isn't that bad a decision on paper. Because it has a premise strong enough to take itself as serious and gritty as could be. Unfortunately, it doesn't really keep that up. The movie is gritty and serious, until it decides not to be.The biggest flaw this movie has, is the angle in which it tells the story. And by biggest, I mean it completely shadows any compliment I'm willing to give this movie. The character Mulan here is not special because she had the courage to defy the traditions of a patriarchal dynasty to protect her family, but instead because she was born with ""superpowers"". And throughout the movie, this aspect just felt like it had stripped the character of her flaws and vulnerabilities and also every bit of hard work and effort she was owed in the original. When she's in combat, you're not seeing someone who had to earn her strength, but rather someone who just is. And this makes the stakes seem so diminished throughout.The one thing I enjoyed about the plot though, was the encounters Mulan had with the Witch character. The motivations and the tensions there were done quite decently I thought.The dialogues were another huge let down. They were so void of life that even the moments that are supposed to be somewhat charming are just outright embarrassing. And so was Mulan's introduction scene for that matter. It was so comically clichéd coupled with bad CG (which is actually surprising considering how the CG was well done overall) that it was just laughable instead of being ""cool"". The action choreography too felt surprisingly choppy and disoriented. With Donnie Yen and Jet Li part of the cast, I surely expected the action to be entertaining... it just was not.Apart from that, I think the costumes were gorgeous and so were the set pieces. The spectacle of the movie was grand in cinematic proportions. And I even enjoyed the score overall, especially that one OST which employs an instrumental version of ""Reflections"" from the original. Was a nice touch.",Mulan
168,stermix501,don't let politicians rate this,10,13 September 2020,"I was expecting this movie since it was announced.
What a great casting, Yifei Liu was the perfect lead choice, Donnie Yen and Jet Li at the position they deserved, Gong Li at a character apparently written for her.Nice cinematography with natural and production designed rooms, fantastic landscapes, immense Chinatowns that you cannot tell if they are real or CGI.Main script LOYAL to the original anime version, BRAVE changes of characters omitting boring Mushu and songs and inclusion of Gong Li's witch, TRUE as far as a westerner can tell to the Chinese culture.A light touch of Disney in the somewhat flamboyant color choices and in the absence of any drop of blood despite numerous killings.Better than the anime and better than the Chinese version made about a decade earlier which was only for adults.Now if you are a Chinese nationalist who doesn't like Chinese speaking English or American companies earning from Chinese folklore; or a political issues fanatic judging a movie from activists' targetted locations of shooting 1min of the movie, you might certainly get annoyed by minor things (some people rated 1 because the Phoenix was not talking); but if you are a non-Chinophobian normal person, you will certainly like it.",Mulan

171,mbhgkmsgg,Mulan,4,16 December 2020,"Mulan is the live-action remake of the animation bearing the same name. It follows other remakes in Disney's attempt to revive the classics and give them new flavour. The live-action journey, which begun quite well with Jungle Book, seems to have deteriorated along the way, as is evident by their latest effort.This 2020 version seems to have taken everything good about the original, and replaced it with less engaging and impactful ideas. Mushu has been replaced with a phoenix that seems to have nothing but symbolic value. The training montage, which is one of the best parts of the animation and one of the most iconic scenes in any Disney film, has been replaced with a spectacularly boring set of scenes that try their hardest to convey the same emotion. And worst of all, Mulan herself has been replaced by a version that lacks any depth, seems to have been born with what are basically superpowers and is one of the least likeable characters in any Disney film. Quite frankly, there is nothing that this new live-action remake did better, which is quite worrisome. The only reason anyone should ever have for remaking a film is to improve it. With Mulan, however, it's evident that the only goal was to make money.The story, which has always been my favourite part about this film, is a simpler, less ambitious and shallower version of the original. Mulan, instead of being a literal nobody having to learn everything from scratch, is already stunningly skilled at a young age. Her journey into the ranks of the imperial army is stupidly simple this time around. She never struggles with any of the tasks. Instead, she feels the need to hide her skills because her father said so. Once the call to war comes, Mulan and her regiment take arms against the enemy and survive and even thrive in the battle. Not once did I feel like there was anything at stake, nor did I ever wonder who would survive. And although the story is blander and less meaningful than the original, what bothered me the most, was the way Mulan was portrayed.
This film has always been about empowerment and courage to be who you are. The reason the original animation is so loved by so many, myself included, is because anyone and everyone can relate to Mulan. She starts from nothing and has to learn everything from scratch through the hard way. As a kid, and even now as an adult, that's a story that I could always relate to. When watching Mulan, the 2020 edition, I could never do that. Not once in my life have I been able to jump from rooftop to rooftop, do backflips, or handle any kind of weapon as efficiently as Mulan did as a kid. I couldn't relate to any of that as an adult, and I feel like kids would have an even harder time. That story, which originally captured the hearts of many, is turned into a hollow mess, that conveys none of the values of the original film.Having seen all the bad reviews, and having heard nothing but bad things, I was still curious to see what this movie was like. Because of all the negativity surrounding it, I decided that I would try to watch without comparing it to the original. However, as I quickly realized, that turned out to be impossible. From the very first moments, I felt like I was watching a completely different film. While the story might be at least remotely similar to the original one, the characters are what make Mulan so bad. In fact, I don't think that there is even any point in comparing the two stories. Both films, this and the animation from 1998 are Disney properties, and they have every right to make changes to the story. As such, I didn't mind most of the changes, although I didn't like them. However, when you take the characters, which are crucial for this story, and turn them into empty husks of the originals, that's where problems arise. And oh boy do they arise in Mulan.There isn't anything inherently wrong with this film. Had it not been a remake of an older film, I probably would've enjoyed it a fair bit more. However, despite my efforts to not compare it to the original and treat it as its own thing, I couldn't help but make comparisons. And as soon as I did, this film fell apart. Everything it tried to do differently felt devoid of any depth and impact. A story of self-discovery and empowerment was turned into one of emptiness and unreachable goals.",Mulan

There are some new fantasy elements to the story and comedy takes a hit as the action becomes more prominent. I liked the movie, though the cinematography, especially during the fighting sequences where there were a lot of flips, can make you a bit dizzy from time to time.Oh, and I wish they would have explored ""Chi"" just a bit more.

176,tmpsvita,There's no reason for this to exist in addition to the fact that it's an awful movie,3,24 December 2020,"With ""Mulan"" Disney made same choice that they did with ""The lion King"", adapting the animated movie into a more serious and realistic live-action.
Both the movie failed in the same way but here the process of making the story more credible is even more drastical, they cut off the songs, most of the magical elements and the main comic component (the little dragon).
What's left is a emty, boring and useless movie without any personality and originality, that fail to modernize the original one.
The family-movie component is completely sacrificed and every comic scenes just feel out of place or even embarrassing.
So it's even more frustrating seeing that the action part, the one that should have been elevated when they decided to make it just a simple action movie, never really works.
The action sequences lack of dynamism and mobility, the editing is too slow, heavy and disoriented while the direction is inadequate and it never creates the right set up or makes them look exciting or just convincing, in addition most of the stunts feels wooden.

So I'm judging it as a stand-alone movie.I think the cinematography is amazing. However:1. I found it incredibly boring. Notably - I didn't feel any connection to the characters, or relate to their feelings / motivations.2. It's not really clear what genre this movie is trying to be. Does it want to be serious, or funny? Because the jokes fell flat.3. I feel that the fantasy element that they were going for didn't really fit. There was no real context provided as to whether these characters are human or not. But for some reason, people could fight Matrix style; and some characters could shapeshift. It kinda felt like the writers randomly meshed together ideas from different movies, and I'm not sure that it worked.One final thing to mention - I ended up watching the cartoon version immediately after.

I went into it with the knowledge that Disney took a different approach to the story and didn't just make an exact live action version of the animated version. I came to this film as open minded as can be and still I'm disappointed. Sure I was upset that Mushu and the songs had been cut out, but I forgave that when they said they wanted be more loyal to the original legend. Still, this film failed to deliver.I cannot stand the addition of the ""witch"" character. I did my research to see if there's a witch in the original legend and no there isn't. In fact there are no supernatural elements in the original legend and this is a legend that came about in late 300s-500s A.D ! Disney wanted to play the ""loyal"" to the original source game, then why on earth did they get rid of the lovable supernatural elements like the ancestors, Mushu, and the cricket and trade them for this annoying addition of a witch ? This made no sense.In the animated version, the villain has a hawk sidekick. This movie gave that hawk a bigger role by having it be a witch. Like in Maleficent with the raven character from Sleeping Beauty being a shape shifter or something in the live action adaptation. The animated Mulan was much more realistic with the battle scenes even with Mushu and the cricket involved, the live action turned the battle scenes into fantastical nonsense by including this witch in the film. She talks to Mulan and Mulan eventually sympathizes with her, but it's just ridiculous. That was my main biggest pet peeve with this disastrous film.The songs were removed but you can hear their melodies in the background for some scenes. Yet they pulled a live action ""Lion King"" and have the characters talk the lyrics to the songs we all know and love. What in the world were they thinking ? Did they think people enjoyed the voice actor of Scar in the live action ""Lion King"" talking his way through ""Be Prepared ?"" All this did was show me how much I prefer the original animated version and in the middle of the film, I'm already thinking about rewatching the animated one.The fighting scenes are just cheesy. Disney makes this film to be more respectful to the Chinese community and they give them a film with comical kung-fu scenes. I mean I have no idea what was going through their heads when they made this? Even crazier that Disney was so confident with this one, with the way they acted with the release of this, they probably thought this was gonna be a big Oscar contender. If anything, maybe for the costumes, but in terms of direction, story, and acting - yeah right.This was a huge heads-up (as if a lot of the previous ones weren't already) that Disney needs to stop with the live action remakes. This was yet another soulless, shameless cash grab. They wanted to make it up to China since there was controversy with the animated version back in the late 90's, but I don't see how this embarrassment fixed anything. Disney, you want to know why China responded positively to Dreamworks Kung Fu Panda ? Apart from the animation of that time, they loved the idea that they respectfully used their culture to tell a fun, heartwarming story. Sadly that's clearly where Disney is lacking nowadays, storytelling, that's why they keep releasing unnecessary live action remakes every year.Do yourself a favor and skip this. Save the extra $30 if you're already a Disney Plus subscriber and just rewatch the 90's classic. 2 stars is generous, but the makeup and costume department deserve a positive shout out.",Mulan

There were some terrible moments in the movie thats for sure, the enemy especially who could run up walls, turn into animals and use magic to attack. These moments literally had me yelling ""WHAT!!! HAHAHA, this is stupid""
The lack of it being a musical and classic characters like Mushu was a missed opportunity. I can see they wanted to do something different and take a risk, but it was one that didn't pay off obviously. What was replaced instead was way worse - a flying phoenix that came and went cannot compare to Mushu in anyway.

This movie just wasn't necessary. It happened but it didn't need to. Everything was kind of blah and it didn't really have any heart to it.
The only good thing was the cinematography, which looked really nice. It was fine enough to sit through once or half-watch but I wouldn't want to do that again.
I appreciated that it was set in China with all Chinese actors it it was also annoying that they spoke English. Like... you almost had it.
Also, that makes it clear that it was just an attempt to make more money. The story of Mulan is always great so the remake wasn't really necessary since it's the same plot. All the signs point towards cash grab.

185,jackson_ro,Mulan,6,16 January 2021,"A straight forward, uninspiring recreation of the Disney classic and Chinese folklore. Nothing truly new is added to the formula, but somehow the essence and motto of the story still shines through, largely due to the brilliance of Yifei Liu. The same can't be said about the supporting cast, as none of them are memorable and is a far cry from the original films. Perhaps I am used to mega pictures using hundreds if not thousands of crowd actors, the battle and city scenes in the film are embarrassingly lacking of more warm bodies, which takes the realism of the film away. I have no gripes with the historical inaccuracies of the film, as I believe this is a story, and stories can be told in different ways to inspire and entertain, Mulan at the end of the day, is not a documentary. Yifei Liu's embodiment of Mulan's character and some of the gorgeous scenic in the film makes Mulan an acceptable movie, though not exactly a very memorable one.",Mulan

189,TheCasualReviewer,I'll stick to the animation.,2,5 September 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
Mulan (Yifei Liu) disguises herself as a man so she can fight in a war that her father is too old to.REVIEW:
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MULAN WHYYYYYYYYYYYY????*clears throat*Okay. Let me explain. I absolutely love the Mulan animated film. One of my all time favorites. I knew going into this film that they were making some ridiculous changes like taking out the songs and taking out Mushu and adding a new villain in the shape-shifting Xianniang (Li Gong) and I was still completely on board when I saw the trailer. This was my most anticipated film of the year so let me now go ahead and explain why this film left such an incredibly bad taste in my mouth. I'll break this one down into sections.DIRECTING/EDITING/SPECIAL FX:
First of all, the directing and editing/special effects were all so poorly done. For example, there's a scene near the beginning of the film when the invaders (this films version of the Huns and can't remember their name even. Something with an ""R"") are attacking one of the battalions and Xianniang uses a rug to reel this one guard in and there's about 7-8 jump cuts of her just reeling him in. I almost got nauseous from all of the unnecessary cuts just to make a shot look quicker when I'm reality one or two cuts at most would've served that shot much better. Then we had some shots where the camera turned sideways and then back upright and although I think a shot like that could've been amazing, the way it was used was almost just like an experiment. It could've been used far more efficiently. In any of the moments where the characters were going airborne, it felt very messy. I could notice imbalance as if they were stuck to rope, which they are, but is something that shouldn't be noticeable. Not giving any spoilers, but there's literally a scene where a large group of the invaders are on a hill catapulting fireballs at the imperial army and Mulan looks at them from below and in the very next scene is all of a sudden behind them... the only way she could logically done that without being scene is taking a week long trip around this giant hill which by that time would be too late for the other soldiers. Mind-boggling. I can then go on with how ridiculous some of the moves looked to a point where I held in laughter for the sake of the others watching the film with me and didn't want to be rude, but I'd be spoiling the film. Oh and the slow motion shots. My dear lord and savior the amount of slow motion shots in this film. It's truly something to see.STORY:
This part isn't something that I think people would necessarily agree or disagree with me on, but it's just my own opinion. I'm not a fan of how Mulan was already an established warrior. I understand that what they were going for is saying that this ""Chi"" that's within Mulan, is within every woman and it's up to them to know it's okay to bring it out regardless of how anyone else feels about it. I agree with that sentiment, however, the original film shows that even though you may not know it, as a woman, there is a warrior within and that you should do everything in your power to bring it out and to show others that you are just as capable as any man to be the fiercest warrior. Both sentiments are good, but there's something about someone who has barriers in front of them and us as viewers watching them break through the barriers to triumph. When Mulan already has this powerful ""Chi"" it by default makes her have an edge on other soldiers and doesn't create much of a challenge. Yea Xianniang is her opposite, but that storyline was so obvious to predict and there were almost no fighting scenes between the two. And the one or two that were in the film didn't feel intense. Didn't feel like Milan's life was in danger at any point. We had multiple scenes that felt so rushed. Not a moment that I felt any emotion whatsoever. Like the scene where Mulan I think is sneaking up on her dad to see him attempt to hold a straight sword and seeing in his eyes the fear, but the honor he must uphold. It's very emotional in the animation and in this it's completely butchered and void of any emotion. Scenes like the matchmaker that are actually trying to taking something from the original are so disappointing to watch and to know this will be the Mulan for most new generation kids. Then I would love to go on a rant on how taking out the commander love interest isn't necessary (cause you could form feelings for a higher up who's actually a genuinely good person) and how taking out the songs is preposterous, because obviously the original film wasn't sexist at all, in fact it was showing that you don't have to be a man to be a warrior, but that's for a different day.ACTING:
The only performance I felt was slightly above average was Yoson An as Honghui. The only thing is he played a character that almost any person can play. Just be charming on screen. BOOM! Love interest... check. Everyone else, including Yifei Liu, were somewhere between average and just bad. Some was due to writing and a lot was due to just bad acting. I'm pretty sure no one there was comic relief. A couple moments were supposed to be comical and missed. I don't understand why they couldn't have actors to represent those 3 goofball soldiers from the original. I know they have Yao (Chen Tang), but none of them at all resemble the original. If there's no Mushu and no soldiers for comical relief do we really have Mulan? Could we have made a film outside of the Mulan property? I still would've seen it, but yes I know millions wouldn't have and that's unfortunate, but it's better than tarnishing a beloved property.This was already so long and I could write a 10-page essay on how disappointing this film was for me, between the poor directing, bad acting, corny SFX and so much more it's hard for me to even give it as high of a score I'm giving it. The only reason I'm giving it this score is due to the sole fact that I feel part of me is slightly comparing it to the original which I think is fair in ways like when they're literally taking specific scenes from the animation, but the other part of me knows it wasn't meant to be a shot for shot live-action remake. The only redeeming factors was the scenery, the horses and the score that was played at poor moments and was too soft to really feel much from. 2.0/10.",Mulan
190,sixhoos,It's OK,4,12 September 2020,But kind of slow at times. Not as good without Eddie Murphy. And the word is Disney and the CCP killed more Uighurs making this movie than Cecil B DeMille.,Mulan
191,arod_85,"Not horrible, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed...",6,6 September 2020,"Mulan is one of my favorite Disney animated films so I was ecstatic when I heard a live action remake was coming. I was so disappointed when it was pushed back due to a Covid-19. I finally forked out the $30 to see it through Disney plus and I regret to say, the live action film left very much to be desired. In my opinion, Disney made a tremendous mistake straying from the original animated story and eliminating the iconic songs and characters. I'm all for making a movie more historically accurate, but the movie appeared to attempt to take a more realistic approach which is one of the main aspects working against it. If they wanted a more serious and realistic approach, the storyline, acting and fight scenes needed to be stepped up significantly. The story of Mulan could have pulled off being written as an epic with large armies, further character development, a darker villain, increased action and intense fight scenes. But the live action attempt completely failed to make an epic action movie creating something boring and pretty bland. If they didn't want to push the envelope with more violence and maturity, they should have stuck with what worked for the animated version. The entire appeal of Disney is to bring ""magic"" and music. ""Make a Man Out of You"" is one of the best Disney songs of all time! Why they bothered adding the supernatural component of the witch and Phoenix and removing Mushu was beyond me. It would have been amazing to see him in cgi and he would have brought some much needed comic relief to the movie that would have made up for the lazy plot, boring scenes, underwhelming action scenes, and poor acting. I also found myself inserting where a song should have went during certain scenes of the movie. The character development was also extremely poor. Jet Li sounded robotic reciting his lines and for a second, I wondered if his speaking parts were voice overs. They significantly under utilized a strong martial arts actor there. The actress playing Mulan actually fit the role well, but they failed her with what she was given to work with. She came off like a jerk for risking her life and her family's honor just to prove a woman could do better than what a man could instead of coming off like a selfless girl trying to protect her ailing father. I don't entirely regret watching, but I wouldn't watch again. Definitely don't spend $30 on this. Wait to watch when it is added to Disney Plus's regular roster. Man, these live actions started out so promising with the great Jungle Book, good Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin, but The Lion King and Mulan were mediocre, perhaps even downright bad.",Mulan

196,mailtaskservice,Big starts but too poorly made and terrible directors,2,6 September 2020,"At the start, it was too exaggerated. The stunts were poorly made because they were seen so fake. The home of Mulan was different from the real story. In this movie, she is from a very poor family in a Hakka fort! This fort is too new to be even in the Mulan old ancient story. Hakka forts are not even anywhere old enough to match the time difference. Then in this home part of the story, there were so many lousily made stories.
How can 12 men soldiers conquer a city fort? The director thought city armies only consist of a few soldiers? These directors don't even know what they were doing!
Even when the 12 gang enemy re-routed, it was nonsense to chase in that direction where home soldiers' bows and the enemy big troops are in the same places. Other big nonsenses were in the avalanche that Mulan is faster than a big avalanche and enemy is too foolish to change shooting at big armies but to shoot at a few soldiers with a cannon!
Many nonsenses jokes were shot at the palace too because no armies were missing guarding at the fort. These directors seemed never seen any China palace walls because they do not know the walls are also pathways!
I cannot give this movie a normal start because Disney is a very big movie maker with very big budgets. When a so big movie company had made so many big flaws, it should be condemned for wasting customers money and time. The actors are good but the movie was so badly directed.",Mulan

What? This film is riddled with today's politics and these new, and not improved, societal norms that aren't normal. It's boring and adds absolutely nothing to the film.The story is thinly, and that's being generous, based on the original animated film, and the ""twist"" is just not good enough to make this original, but we all have to recognize that this director has only directed sports movies, and romantic films and has NEVER once directed an action film and boy does it show.The writing is just as shameful as the story and the acting is atrocious. It felt like I was watching a 1970's Kung Fu movie, with a ""modern"" twist. You know, the ones that are ""dubbed"" in English by those ""professional"" voice actors and actresses that sounded like every line was read on the spot and not asked to be read or re-recorded. What I'm trying to say is that Disney, the ditector, the writer and the cast should all be ashamed for making this sad excuse for a film.",Mulan
199,greggman,Bad Writing,4,28 May 2021,"I don't have a problem that this was not a ""remake"" and didn't follow the original cartoon. The story of Mulan is far older. Unfortunately it was just poorly conceived and poorly written.In the original Mulan is a smart woman and using her smarts she saves the day multiple times. She also had to struggle to learn the skills of a soldier.In this one she's a magic person who has to hide her magic because of an oppressive society. She doesn't work to become better, she's just born with magic abilities and has been hiding them. That's arguably the single biggest issue is that it robs us of any connection with Mulan. In the original most of us can feel Mulan's struggle but in this version she's special in a way no real person is so we can't put ourselves in her place like we could with the original.Other ill conceived ideas, since it wasn't just a remake there was no reason to use the original score as inspiration for this movie. It didn't add to the movie because it wasn't appropriate for the situation. All it did was pull you out of this movie was you remembered the other.I also didn't have a problem with the ""magic"" or incredible skills. I like movies like ""Hero"" and ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" or many other Chinese martial arts movies where people have incredible skills. But, those movies did it well, this one fails. The witch herself was overpowering so though. The writer of the original would have had Mulan defeat her through smarts like turning her power against here. Her we just have the witch giving up because she sees herself in Mulan. Okay, that's about the most boring resolution you could have. If you wanted to go that direction how about them actually teaming up and having to overcome someone even more powerful. In fact the witches death made zero sense. Surely with all her powers she'd have had a way to block or catch that arrow.Even the scene with Mulan serving tea was botched. Given the matchmaker saw the spider why would she blame Mulan?So disappointing.",Mulan
200,MovieWarfare,Another inferior Disney Remake,4,9 September 2020,"I am still waiting for that all Asian cast American movie that will be the ""Black Panther"" for the Asian community. So far the only proper all Asian cast American movie is Crazy Rich Asian and that was a rom-com about rich people which isn't what I am looking for. The Disney live-action remake of Mulan (1998) is a proper big-budget all Asian cast movie that aligns with what I am looking for. However, Disney live-action remakes have been mostly a miss apart from ""The Jungle Book"" and ""Cinderella"". Mulan (2020) is directed by Niki Caro who won lots of awards for her movie Whale Rider(2002) but it does make me wonder if they couldn't have just hired an Asian director but whatever. The trailers though seem to suggest that this remake was actually attempting to do things differently from the original which intrigued my interest. Unfortunately, due to coronavirus, this movie got delayed and then shoved to streaming with a hefty price instead of going to cinemas. I actually avoided watching the original Mulan recently just to make myself go into this movie with a more open mind and to have a sort of first time watching experience again. Therefore, I am going to avoid comparison with the original in this review. So after watching this, did the movie live up to the expectations?
Note: unlike my previous reviews there is going to be a fair amount of minor spoilers here so be warned.Firstly, visually the movie is quite beautiful. There are some gorgeous shots in this movie such as the martial art practice by the lake, Mulan running on the rooftops and even the war itself was quite visually pleasing. The cinematography isn't ""Roger Deakins"" level of stunning but it is definitely really good looking. This is also elevated by the really good set design and costumes. The set design allows for great scenery and the costumes feel authentic. These really help pull the audience into the movie and the era that Mulan is set in.Secondly, the score by Harry Gregson-Williams who has done the score for movies like Shrek and The Martian does a pretty good job here as well with Mulan. They use a lot of wind instruments that are heard from a lot of Chinese movies and pretty much use them here. The score generally works and it really helps create the atmosphere for each scene really well. Also, the orchestral cover of Reflection from the original Mulan is used in this movie and is just really awesome,Now my gripes with this movie. Firstly, is the lack of emphasis on emotional moments. It feels like the movie brushes over a lot of what I would consider quite important. The scene where Mulan makes the decision to go to war is one of the important decision she makes. However, the movie just has her pick up a sword and then the next scene she is in armor and off to war. We don't get any emphasis on how important this decision was and the sacrifices she had to make until halfway through the movie for some reason. This happens a couple of times as well such as when there is a destroyed town which shows the horror of war but they only spend a couple of seconds here with minimal reaction from the characters and it's then just off to the next scene. Another being a character dying and it's just whatever. The movie feels really lacking in a lot of humanity but there are a couple of banter moments between Mulan and ""friends"" that have some fun in it.On that note of characters, the supporting characters are rather bland. Honghui (Yoson An) acts as a love interest, rival and ally for Mulan which is all there is about him. Commander Tung (Donnie Yen) sort of mentors Mulan and knew Mulan's dad but that's really it. The Emperor (Jet-li) is a badass and wise emperor who barely appears in the movie. Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) who is the main villain also barely appears in the movie despite being the bad guy who started the war. The Witch (Gong Li) who is probably the worst character in this entire movie is like Mulan but bad. These are all the relevant supporting characters but there are others who are so forgettable I don't remember if they even had names.The character arc which is part of the story is not great either. Mulan's decision to finally be true to herself and not hide that she is a woman just sort of happens because she got beaten up. Instead of it happening in a dramatic way it just feels rather random. Also, Mulan is special because she got lots of chi which ruins the message of the movie. Instead of feeling like she earned her place in the army and gaining the recognition of her comrades through her efforts it instead feels like she only got it because she is the chosen one. So the message is now ""be true to yourself only if you're the special one"". The Witch also goes through a character arc as well but it is extremely rushed and dumb. She makes choices that don't even make any sense such as divulging the main villain plans or sparing Mulan constantly or the really dumb choice at the end of the movie. Her addition to Mulan is pointless and if anything took away all the screentime from the main villain instead.The action scenes are also mediocre which is such a shame. Asian movies have always nail action scenes with their amazing choreography but in Mulan it is BORING. The trailers made it seem like it might be in the veins of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" withs it floaty yet elegant style of fighting. However, it instead really plain and overly edited with many cuts.On that note of edits, there are some weird edits in this movie that make it feel like there were important scenes that were cut. Minor spoilers but there is a scene where Mulan is riding a horse towards the enemies army in an open field but then the next scene suddenly has her behind the enemy hiding behind a rock with no explanation whatsoever. There is also a scene where after Mulan has decided to be true to herself in which she saves an ally but makes a choice to disappear into the fog. The next scene is then showing her dramatically coming back to her allies seconds later. It is so weird and took me out of the movie for sure.I also have to talk about our main lead actress Liu Yifei who plays Mulan. She sucks. She plays Mulan with no charm or charisma or even a personality. The tone in her voice is always the same and the only real change in her voice is when she is pretending to be a male with a deep voice. She also makes no expression whatsoever, it always feels like she has the same neutral expression in every moment even when someone died its the same expression. At least Donnie Yen and Jet Li are good in their roles though.Overall, the movie is not the all Asian cast American movie I am waiting for. It is just another inferior remake from Disney. It has none of the fun that was in the original so the movie just ends up being boring. There are some things you can enjoy in the movie with some pretty good moments sprinkled in there. Additionally, it is still pretty much a retelling of the original Mulan so the overall story is still there. It just isn't as good it could have been. Such a shame...",Mulan
201,KreamLeehan,"I feel sorry for the kids, these days.",6,5 September 2020,"So cheeeesy! When I was a kid everything Disney put out was in level of art but what they put out these days is just something to kill time with. This movie version of Mulan has great shooting set, computer graphics, casting, and acting but all goes down due to not the failure of individuals but the incompatibility of the script - Its foundation. At the beginning the movie goes all fine. Your awe and expectations grow and grow and then starting from the middle, it becomes sooo cheesy! Level of cliche reaches the roof! Is Disney underestimating our young generation? Do they not know they are used to exploding buildings and dead hit gun-fires? Oh, yes, sure, the last scene was moving. But that one redeeming quality can only do so much. Who in the right mind can be okay with that horrible time pause they portrayed in the war scene?

Forget the scenery, the costumes, the action, the amazing fight scenes... they're mad because it's not the 1998 Mulan. Guess what? IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE! The targeted audience won't care. People complained the same about the 2019 Lion King. Can people just enjoy a remake without whining ""oh it's not like the first one, it's not like the first one"". I loved both Lion Kings and I like both Mulans. It's possible, you know, if you stop wishing and wanting so much. I think of all the girls born after 1998 that this movie will inspire, while the old are nostalgic about first versions of everything.",Mulan
204,pronitmallick,Nothing new or special on the table,3,13 September 2020,Mulan 2020 checks out as a movie that tries to start the film with a big volume of a story but ends up with a small one. The pacing feels ok. The screenplay looks sloppy right from the start and it also fails to redeem itself throughout the rest of the movie. The second arc tries to lift the film but doesn't add anything special at the table. If you are an OG fan of the original animated Mulan film then this Live-Action adaptation will disappoint you. Overall Mulan 2020 is a time pass movie from start to end.,Mulan

I also thought that Disney could have released this to the theatres instead of charging people an arm and a leg on top of channel membership for this film.

207,Chaokage,I watched the animation and this one hit me harder!!!,10,6 September 2020,The movie is incredible. I enjoyed every bit of it. And I hated how someone like Mulan was judged by her sex not by her worth. It is not new to us that we had a very long history of oppression based on male hierarchy that had no foundation but fear and the need to control. I'm a man and I hate it. A lot of people seems to compare this with the animation but do no get stuck with the past. It's better to move on and see how this movie brings a beautiful story in a very complex settings that is the Chinese culture. I really loved this one better than The Lion King and Beauty and The Beast. They took a risk on something new and in my opinion succeeded. The more people watch it the better the rating will get for this movie. It is indeed an everlasting story that touches deeply what means to be a human. Thank you Yifei Liu for being our Mulan.,Mulan

If that makes you think I don't get to have an opinion about this movie, then don't bother reading on.I absolutely loved the animated Mulan, but I had zero expectations that this movie was going to be just another remake shot for shot like Lion King or Aladdin (the former I hated and the latter I loved as a sidenote). Based on the trailer, I figured this was going to be a Disney war movie. And that's exactly what I got.The casting was great. Donnie Yen is always a pleasure. The acting was good too. I've read accusations that Mulan was ""soulless"" - what would you expect from a girl who has been told her whole life to suppress her gifts? She is subdued, yes. But by no means soulless.The action is fun, a la Crouching Tiger. Is it realistic? Of course not. But it's entertaining.The story is beautiful. People who don't get it must have zero understanding of the importance of honor. I was crying within the first five minutes, and I cried at end. It was wonderfully told.My only criticism is the witch. She seemed like an unnecessary character invented just to drive home a feminist point. I appreciated aspects of her character, but overall I think her presence diminished the menace of the actual villain.This movie is great. A little intense for the younger kids, but overall it's one of the better Disney reboots.",Mulan

212,dan_slentz,Do yourself a favor.. SEE THIS MOVIE AT A THEATER!!! NOT on a TV small screen!,5,7 September 2020,"Disney has finally released the new live-action version of the 1998 cartoon Mulan.There have been multiple revisions between the old cartoon and this one, and my daughter and I both felt the audience for the new one should be (and is) an older group than the young kids of the cartoon. There's a lot more violence and it contains more of the action of a Marvel movie than a Disney.The story was good (and pretty similar to the cartoon version), and the actress who played Mulan (Yifei Liu) did an awesome job at playing Mulan! The action was there (and arrows and spears in people), and scenes were beautiful (with mostly convincing digital effects), but there a couple of problems related to this movie's release. First, this IS a ""BIG screen movie"", not a ""movie for home"", meaning the small screen of the house actually hurts the movie. The story itself was good, but something just seemed to be missing in it. A lot of character development just didn't seem to be in this movie. IMDB rates this a 5.6 (user review average at time of this writing). I'd have to agree with that. And what I've found is a movie under a 6 just isn't a great movie (a movie at a 5.6 or better is still worth seeing).... and with ""Mulan"", that's a shame because I truly believe it could have pulled about a 5.9 to 6.0 if release on the big screen (at least al little better).This is a first time saying this, but I would NOT watch this on TV or through Disney+, but WAIT to see if it does come to the big screen!! You will certainly like it better with the full impact of the large visuals and a great audio system of a theater than on a 52"" LED TV at home! This movie seriously was NOT produced for the small screen. I wish Disney had waited to release this at theaters first.I give this a 5.6 and suggest it's really NOT for kids under about 10 years old. And PLEASE wait to see this AT A THEATER! If you see it at a theater, I promise you'll walk away much more impressed than watching it at home. It is NOT worth $30 on Disney+! (I seriously wished I had NOT watched it on my 52"" OLED TV but waited to see at a theater (assuming they might still release it at theaters).",Mulan
213,sagetwo,Mulan becomes a Mary Sue,1,20 September 2020,"The animated film taught me the values of hard-work, determination and wit as well as the importance of teamwork. We shine by being ourselves and placing family and country first. But in this movie, young females are being taught differently. Mulan stood out because she is ""special"". She can jump and run on roofs. And kicks an arrow into the villain's chest which kills him. So, we need to be born with talent to shine? How is that something to teach young females? Hollywood can't tell the difference between a Mary Sue and an empowered female. Also, we can't have Mushu. But we have a phoenix and a shapeshifting witch.I gave the movie, 1/10 because there are no positives. Besides the bad narrative and message of the movie, Liu Yi Fei and the other actors wooden facial expressions in this movie somehow. It is weird watching a live-action movie with Chinese actors speaking English.And Liu Yi Fei's support for police brutality, Donnie Yen wanting Hong Kong to return to China, and the movie relation to the concentration camps...not helping the movie's ratings.",Mulan

218,darrenbjones,Mulan has arrived.,8,6 September 2020,"Mulan has arrived, not at cinemas as originally planned but instead as the first film in what will likely become a library of Premier Subscription titles. As the latest live action remake of an animated classic this will naturally draw comparisons with the 1998 original Disney movie.
If you're looking for nostalgia, songs and animal sidekicks then go for the 1998 version. If you're looking for a more adult offering with battles and a discussion of duty and sacrifice then the 2009 version is for you.
This Mulan is a story about embracing yourself, it's full of subtle and not so subtle imagery and honours the story of Mulan while also providing a film that isn't just a rehash of the animated original.
There is still stylised choreography, excellent wire work and great set pieces as the Chinese army take on the Rouran. Mulan, the brave daughter of Zhou, takes her father's place in the army to save his life. She wrestles with hiding her true identity as she trains to help save China.
This story is about two women, Mulan and the witch Xianniang, both women having been forced to hide who they truly are. Xianniang allowed it to torment her, driving her to seek validation with the armies of Borï Khan who dislike and distrust her as much as the Chinese but see her as a useful weapon. Mulan refuses to accept this fate and instead risks everything to embrace her true self, understanding that it will enable her to unlock her full potential but also doom her to dishonour and possible death as she seeks to save China.
Mulan is protected and guided by the Phoenix, a powerful Chinese symbol of grace, virtue, balance and harmony. The bird guides her through to her acceptance of her true self and symbolically follows her when she accepts her destiny.
It's a wonderful film and an empowering interpretation of the story for young girls. The action scenes are exciting but not graphic and the performances are great. There are also some lovely nods to the original such as the character Cricket, one of the soldiers Mulan meets.
Yifei Liu is excellent as Mulan and the film is certainly enhanced by her doing the majority of her own stunts. Donnie Yen gives a powerful performance as Commander Tung, Tzi Ma and Rosalind Chao are wonderful as Mulan's parents and both Jason Scott Lee and Li Gong are solid villains.
There is great rewatch value in this film and I'm sure repeat viewings will reveal more subtleties. In my opinion it is the second best Disney live action after Jungle Book and well worth the money for the Premium Subscription.",Mulan
219,ty-jensen,Another bland remake but not terrible.,4,10 December 2020,"I understand why Mulan is beloved but I think it's just fine, I seen it only twice. I wasn't excited for this remake, I think most fans were dreading it. Mulan isn't terrible but it's another bland remake.The acting ranges from bland to okay. Yifei Liu is really bland, she's stoic the whole time but maybe she was badly directed. I think Jason Scott Lee gives the best performance.Mulan herself is written as a perfect warrior. She can easily train and fight because she has chi so she's like a Dragon Ball character or a Force user from Star Wars. I like to see strong females but they shouldn't be invincible. Rey from Star Wars is really powerful but she's not invincible or stoic.This remake has the same story as the original but it has some differences so it's not a carbon copy. It's so serious which could of worked if the script was better. It has some humor which really falls flat.The action is fine, it could of been better. The editing is somewhat choppy, it's not like the 2018 Robin Hood movie. Yeah, the climax is the best action scene.Overall, Mulan is bland as expected. I probably would of been harsher if I loved the original. If you have Disney+, you could give it a shot if you want.",Mulan

The visuals aren't indicative of it. It's just not great. It lacks character development. It's awfully long. It feels soulless and empty. This is the kind of thing I expect to be buried on some cable channel.It reminds me of when Hallmark channel did ""Voyage of the Unicorn"" but that movie had good feeling and lacked the budget. That result was good. This movie does the opposite it feels... lacking. It's like they want you to care while watching this but you won't.I think charging $30 for it is the biggest issue. If they aired this as some cable channel broadcast it would go down as a forgettable less good cable release.I mean if you've got 2 hours to waste by all means you can do worse but it's not worth paying to watch.

What I see is a brand-new film. I think it's very good. From the perspective of picture, music, or intention, it's very Disney, but it's out of the framework of traditional Princess movies. If I choose, I hope to take my children to see Mulan, and the values it reflects are very suitable for teaching Children, the only thing that bothers me is that I can't watch it on the big screen, so I can only give nine points for it.",Mulan
223,SebMoz,My god I hate this,1,18 December 2020,"To remake a beloved movie is not simple task. To use another artform could prove to be even harder. Disney during the 2010's have been notorious in this practice, and the new live-action remakes are almost always weaker than their animated counter-parts. I therefore went into this movie with low expectations, yet that didn't help the movie in the slightest. It's almost astounding how much this movie tries and fails. The main story remains unchanged, but the sense of urgency and suspense is non-existent. The movie clearly tries to be a mix of 'Crouching Tiger: Hidden Dragon' and the original Mulan from 1998, yet it manages to fail at doing any of those styles right. Mulan is reduced from a brave, reckless and somewhat quirky girl who transforms into a great warrior from a normal, to a supernatural robot. She doesn't have a personality at all, and in this movie she is suddenly great at channeling her 'Chi'. This makes her triumphs feel meaningless, because we no longer get a sense that she has to work for anything. It also creates this weird scenario where the live-action remake, despite being marketed as more realistic than the original, loses all sense of grittiness and danger the animated version presented so expertly. Mulan is also damaged by a genuinly awful performance. She shows no emotion or engagement at all, and I tried to picture her current mindset several times, to no avail. The movie also tried to add some emotional depth with some new characters, but every single one of them felt uninspired and bland. Most of the characters from the original have been scrapped, and the ones we do get are forgettable and boring. The movie also suffers from trying to convey the same emotion the songs in the original did, despite not having any songs. This leads to some very awkward scenes where the characters just flail about, and suddenly they are masters at being soldiers. The cinematography is nothing special, and the landscapes doesn't feel immersive at all, which I feel like is the main reason for having them in the first place. The fight scenes are really poorly edited, and the large battle sequences doesn't have any sense of scale or importance like in the original. The movie also has severe pacing issues, which harms it even more. Usually I would end a review with a summary of the good parts of the movie, but honestly? I'm not even sure there are any here. The movie is a remake that takes everything good about the original out, reduces every existing character to boring cardboard figures, adds new and pointless characters and plotpoints that either doesn't add anything, or actively harms the movie. I genuinly cannot believe how much I hated this movie. If this is how remakes are meant to be, I wish that they be purged from this world immediately, and this movie in particular.",Mulan

It is an enjoyable and action-packed reimagining of the original story. Yifei Liu is great in the title role and the addition of Xianniang, played by Li Gong- a new female villain who is also outcasted for being a strong female warrior- benefits the action narrative. The film is beautiful in 4k and the score provides a striking addition to the action.

228,cristinalinderman,An enchanting profound adaptation.,8,5 September 2020,"* There is no end credit scene *The director Niki Caro and crew brought an enchanting profound adaptation. I loved this version, the differences made it feel more real and it doesn't deviate from the main course of the animated movie, a story about a woman in a man's world. Even though I loved it the storyline was not as strong as it could have been, making the film appear incomplete. There were a lot of magnificent scenes but cut short and I didn't even notice how almost a two-hour film went by in a blink of an eye. It would have been perfect if it had one more hour for more character development, fighting sequences, and mainly one of the exquisite additions the channeling of the chi needed to be explored more.I like both versions but I dare to say I prefer this one over the animated one because this film caught me off guard with so many emotions and there were scenes that tears left my eyes without notice, even remembering scenes have me teared up. What hit me hard was its main theme in which was acceptance and the perspective was not only to be accepted but to also accept oneself, to be true. It was magical how powerful this word expands beyond the story of this film, the longing to belong in such a complicated world. The weak storyline doesn't take away the spirit of the film.The composer Harry Gregson-Williams sets a magical atmosphere and his music build up the lead character's true self.The cast was phenomenal every single one, especially the lead female actor Liu Yifei. She gave life to Mulan and a whole new meaning, a performance that left me wanting more. I also have to give praise to Gong Li as the witch, I didn't expect to be so engaged with her storyline.

It has the style, but lacks the substance. They removed Mushu for ""realism"" but added a shapeshifting witch. At least Mushu as a dragon is representative of Chinese culture. But a witch? They also shoved in a Western phoenix, instead of a Chinese phoenix.The awe-inspiring Disney Magic is downgraded to actual magic. The new Mulan is said to be strong with ""Qi"", the ancient Chinese concept of the Force in Star Wars, and therefore literally superpowers. She is a Mary Sue. There is no growth or struggle like the animated version. The side characters also have no depth, and the acting is...

So don't expect it to be like the animation or you'll be disappointed. If I based my interest in this movie on the reviews alone, I would not have watched it. But thank goodness I did (watched it, that is).The movie is beautifully shot on location with grandiose panoramic shots, and authentic looking sets. The action can be engaging, and beautifully captured. Some unique action sequences, but for most part nothing you haven't seen from these genre of movies before. Like wire work action sequences but not overly done. Overall, it (the action) adds to the story telling of the movie, and not detracts from it.But for me the biggest plus of this movie is, it's not a musical. Thank goodness, they didn't turn this into a musical, like they did with Aladdin. This is an action based movie, where the animation's original musical score is played in the background at appropriate moments, instead of being front and centre.If looking for an action based movie with a feel good story, give this a go.

I did enjoy the movie but I doubt I'll ever need to watch it again.The first hour is a slug. All set up but there really isn't anything compelling to make you care about these characters. There are some good shots and scenes. The archery pursuit scene in particular. I could've watched that for another 20 minutes.Something that seemed odd to me. While Mulan had her secret, the writing seemed stronger. After her secret was out, it seemed that the writing got lazy. When the team arrived and the one place, soldiers dropped in on them, and Mulan says, ""Ambush"". Come on! Can you be any lazier? Of course we know it's an ambush. I don't Facepalm at movies often but...They didn't take advantage of combat scenes. They really could've went with some epic battles. There also was never a time where I felt Mulan was in danger.

241,cameronjames-86959,Better than I expected,7,6 September 2020,"I was one of the many people that was not excited for the live action adaptation of Mulan just because of how terrible the trailers were and after seeing the animated Mulan and hearing about all the changes they were making that just made me even more worried about the movie. But I have to say after seeing this movie I actually really enjoyed it a lot more than I expected to. Mulan(2020) isn't the best Disney live action movie but it is one of the better ones, no it doesn't reach the same heights as say beauty and the beast or Aladdin but it's a lot better than say lion king. The cast in this movie for example is amazing each member delivers a great performance but the man standout is Li gong who steals the show each time she is on screen. The music also is great yes there is no singing in the movie but the score is really good. The characters are also great yes there's the same characters but there is a couple new characters that were a welcome edition to the story. The story is also very unique because it's own thing and not a shot for shot remake of the animated Mulan. The action in this movie also is fantastic there was people running on walls flipping and stuff like that. Where the movie starts to fail Is with the changes, yes some worked but that's very little there was a constant feeling I had of something is missing. The movie also toward the end gets extremely cheesy and the ""realism"" factor gets thrown out the window. Overall, I did enjoy the live action Mulan, is it the best Disney live action movie no it's not but I didn't hate this movie like I expected to.",Mulan
242,damorejj,Another remake done wrong,5,11 September 2020,"Why change the story?! Mulan would be much more impressive if she struggled to get by with the men and earned her achievements like in the cartoon, than this movie where she naturally has these incredible acrobatic gifts.

Certainly entertaining overall.",Mulan
245,joriethomas,What could've been,3,21 December 2020,"I was apprehensive when I heard about this live action version; so far Disney has failed miserably time and time again. They can't seem to find the right formula between keeping the emotion, nostalgia, and magic from the animated version while bringing something new to the table. Aladdin so far is the only one I actually enjoyed and that wasn't great either. I liked that they cut out the love story personally, it wasn't needed but they cut out all emotion entirely it seems. I didn't feel attached to anyone. I didn't have a single spark of emotion throughout. And what was up with the Phoenix?! Served no purpose. They really could've delivered something epic, they had a great cast, I'm not sure where that went wrong exactly but they did horribly.
Best part of this movie was the credits, I thoroughly enjoyed Christina Aguilera's remake of reflection and the new song. Glad I didn't pay lol.",Mulan

I really liked the cast and the movie itself was beautiful and the cinematography was great and that's about it for the positives. The film and plot was dull and very long and uneventful. The lead was prefect but it just wasn't that exciting and fun of a movie.

253,caseyt-48511,A Decent Reimagining Of a Disney Classic,7,5 September 2020,"Mulan 2020 is kinda of a mixed bag. There are some things about the movie that are fantastic while others that fall short. The original movie is a modern masterpiece but I feel this version lacked the heart and soul of the original. That being said, it's not bad at all. The visuals are breathtaking. Everything from the costumes, the colors, the sets, and action are so pretty too look at.The action scenes are unique. To explain, their clearly inspired by classic 60s and 70s Chinese martial arts movies. These films featured almost superhuman like characters just, well, because. As much as I appreciate this homage, I'm not sure it fit with the tone of the movie. That's another thing, the tone. It can't decide if it wants to be a serious war movie or a lighthearted action flick. The originals tone was lighthearted but perfectly balanced the seriousness of war and mortality. I feel that it would have been better if it took its subject matter more seriously.The acting was good as well. Donnie Yen steals the show as he's prone to do. It was great to see Jet Li again as well.the rest of the cast is solid to great. And there's a certain cameo at the end that made me really happy! The characters are fine but don't always have a lot to do or say. It should be noted that it is inspired by a different version of the Mulan legend. So that's why we have such big differences from the first, which in turn was inspired by a mother version.Mulan may be a mixed bag but I mostly enjoyed it. If you've seen and love the first one you're going to be much more critical. But if this is your first introduction then you may like it better. The visuals and technical achievements are so great they really save the movie.",Mulan

I am SO proud of my friend for her beautiful song 'loyal brave and true' which Christina also does justice.The movie itself, I don't know where to begin what a hot mess it was. The original film had at least humor and romance in addition to the action. This was straight action. The original was made for everyone. This film felt made for boys. I was bored out of my skull the Whole time. There wasn't even a conflict to add, like in the original when she pretends to be a man. She blows that cover almost immediately,

Like what does that have to do with the movie's content whatsoever? Too many hurt feelings in these reviews and not enough educated remarks.Let's me start of by saying the things I like about this film.
I liked the idea of having a witch in the movie.the attempt to accurately represent Chinese culture-the cinematographyThis is what I didn't like. The movie felt flat to me. What made the 1998 movie so compelling is the protagonist. In this version, Mulan is already close to perfect and honestly acts too much like a goody goody. This version struggles to make her relatable, which is one of the reasons why people fell in love with the Disney version to begin with. Another major flaw is the lack of character development. The side characters are just boring. Even the villain is boring and unimpressive. Let's get back to the topic of The Witch. The idea was great, but the execution was poor. Again, why do we care about these characters?I believe this film would've been better with a darker tone and some BLOOD. This is a war story for crying out loud. And I know they wanted to keep it family friendly, but they could've done it in a very MCU way. I found this version to be more mature, however, the tone wasn't dark enough to raise the stakes.",Mulan

267,mitrapourmand,Fa Mulan would have been horrified,1,9 May 2021,"If you have been given a ballad about a heroic figure in ancient china, what would be the chances of turning it into an unintentional comedy? I would say the chance are pretty low but is it turns out I'm wrong.To say this movie is a travesty is an insult to travesty, it was a mish mash of everything that could go wrong in a movie on steroids. We have a heroine in making who is apparently magical and can slide of three story buildings (but cant pour a single cup of tea) fighting an army of ninjas in ancient china!!! While being pursued by a bird lady witch, our heroine is so perfect ,she can use her chi (what chi is and how people can use it is not explained so i cant tell you either) she is connected to phoenixes ( again what this links means, what it does and how it works is not explained) she is so tough and cool that she doesnt want to be like other girls ( huh ! Gasp and shocker that is ! How original ) precisely she doesnt want to pour tea ( either your are heroic tomboy or a useless tea pouring so !) so she sneaks off to fight an army of people who dont want gold but are not so adverse at the idea of blood ! This army is made up of ninjas who can run on the walls Mr. Scarf face and the bird like witch lady who uses chi but is not cool ( granted we dont get see much of the witch lady in action much , she just keeps turning into a hawk ) but the witch lady isn't happy with her boss because he doesnt respect her enough. Ok Mulan goes to fight in her fathers place and joins a camping army ( why? She already has chi and as shown later doesnt need training) the training consists of carrying water around ( for some reason ) and Mulan excels! Then she and her small company meet up with bad guys and stuff happen, then she meets with the witch lady and some other stuff happen ! Then she decides to join her friends who had previously told her to eff off, and while riding towards them she leaves her armor behind (why? I guess chi didnt like armor?) she does other stuff and the bad guys is killed, but not before killing the witch lady who had a sudden change of heart.... you know then movie ends ( mercifully).

The chase goes such way that they end up climbing to a roof, The chicken flies off it and she is falling off it and both land on their feet/paws. I thought that was well done, nice! Everyone in the movie did a 'I am so ashamed of you' look and walked away. The worried dad speech results in give up your chi/life force energy gets spoken off. Looks like woman are only good to find a husband, lay down with him and bear children. Thank you Disney for teaching me this.Then she goes to replace her dad in the army. Has trouble to sleep between the men, so she won't end up having to sleep with the men. Thank you Disney for teaching me this. Training in the army goes on and she reconnects with her chi.We see a battle and we see a strategy explained by a wise general as a coward move... and we all know... that's not it general. Why did you not stay in general school. Then the lets strap in these breast ends up saving a life. She sees snow on a hill. I see the plan and I am thinking no one is that stupid. But the enemy army is without brains. Then returning to the army another you can only make babies, rest of you is useless. Thank you Disney for teaching me this. I thought she did very well but I am sure Disney is right about this one.Then the army turns to he/she is not useless. And she can lead an army. And suddenly she leads the army. Soldiers who could not bring 2 buckets of water up to a hill are now invincible. A King (most kings were inbreed power abusers) now has incredible chi powers also. She saves him on a really ridiculous movie set where she is standing on a beam of wood where beneath them is build a furnace for smelting metal (who thought this idea up?)... and then we go to the end so were again a nice obeying daughter.

Don't get me wrong, I love Disney musicals...on animated films. I think that musicals in live actions are lackluster and sometimes even cringy. Anyway, if you were expecting that you will be disappointed.What didn't worked for me? Some changes to the characters, or the addition of new ones, that don't really add anything to the story; some parts of the new plot that don't make much sense; and the totally unrealistic action that reminded me of the typical unbelievable asian kung-fu movies (it wasn't like that in the original, so why on earth would they do that?).

Yet, the storytelling is never boring from the start to the end. I am glued to this.Most of the actors are very good. Gong Li is charming as usual in her grand costume. The main lead is great with very natural look.One little thing that not good enough is the animation of the phoenix.

But it's terribly uneven with its reimagining of the plot. The first half is all but once Mulan joins the army, it picks up speed.Some elements work very well. Namely revising one character into a shapeshifting witch played by Gong LI who is great in this. The fantasy inclusion of chi as a quasi-mystical force lends to some cool fight scenes. It's more violent than more recent Disney movies, though nowhere near as gruesome as the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. But a part of me was hoping it'd lean more into some more hard-hitting kung fu styled action. The one-on-one climax at the end isn't bad, and it kind of reminds me a bit of the first Pirates movie in its setup.The cast is mostly fine but few really stand out as especially memorable. Gong Li is really good in this as mentioned before. Tzi Ma is also good as Mulan's father. The lead actress Yifei Liu is not bad but she's stitled in the more dramatic moments. Jason Scott Lee plays the lead villain and he's honestly bad in this. It's unfortunate. Jet Li is good playing the Emperor of China but he's not onscreen much.The absence of the sidekick Mushu is noticeable, there's not really a comic foil that Mulan can interact with. She has a bland love interest instead. The human sidekicks haven't much personality and are thusly interchangeable.As far as the more recent Disney remakes go, it's not as good as The Jungle Book or Cinderella or even The Lion King. But it's still better than Beauty and the Beast or about the same as Aladdin. The great moments really land and are cool but there's a lot of fluff you have to sit through to get there.",Mulan
291,ancstickers,Eh,6,7 September 2020,"Obviously this movie is nowhere near as beautiful and entertaining as the original. It isn't terrible, but I wouldn't watch it again. The lack of music, lack of character development, and additions of characters did not help this movie in any way. The Emperor in this movie seemed so cold, but in the original he is kind. I genuinely enjoy Mulan and Li Shang's relationship, and that wasn't included in this movie.Would I recommend it? If you like Disney, sure.

I mean... Mushu?! A phoenix?! What about his backstory? That he wanted to bring back honour? And why a phoenix when the symbol of China is a dragon?In the original story, Mulan is no warrior but still risks her life for her dad and family. Now she is a fully accomplished chi warrior who just needs to reveal herself. It weakens the original message.Then the commander, who fell in love with her, is here, a simple soldier. He was supposed to be the one to sentence her to exile and dishonour. Because even though he loved her, this was a question of honour! Here the commander is Donnie Yen who plays a minor role in the story.And who is that witch? Why adding a witch? A woman who wants to be recognized, and integrated, in a society where women are just there to help their husbands and have minor if no roles in society.
I do understand the message they try to push, that Mulan, in this movie, wants to be recognized as the true warrior she is... But that's not the Mulan we know.Finally, I can understand they dropped the songs as they were making a movie... But I really missed the songs.",Mulan

296,jseynopsis,Utterly disappointed!!,1,7 September 2020,"I waited for months in anticipation and excitement for this movie, knowing that many great actors/actresses are involved. But after watching, I'm not only disappointed but angry & disgusted as well.First and for all, there's already a huge damage done to this chinese period film when the movie's dialogue is in english, because the essence, the emotions and the culture are not accurately conveyed. Who says Disney movie can't be in mandarin? If their animated version can be dubbed in different languages, then who says this live-action version can't be filmed in mandarin?Second, it's really a pity Lee Ang turned down the offer for the director of this movie. I feel that Niki Caro has done a really terrible job here. She doesn't know the strength of her actors & actresses, she doesn't know how to direct them into showing the correct emotions. Many times I felt the expressions and emotions of the actors/actresses were so so weird. And she definitely does not know how to bring out & convey the essence of a chinese period drama culture. So many emotional scenes that could potentially help the movie develop into a more exciting level were sloppishly done and abruptly concluded. So many huge stars were involved, yet I feel that their talents had been wasted here.The push factor (fight scene between Gong Li and Li Yifei at the battlefield) for Mulan to reveal her real identity is so weak. The scene where Mulan tries to convince the Commander that the king is in danger is also effortless and lousy. The witch's switch of alliance is also so weird, and without proper development. The defeat of Bori Khan was so easy, like a child's play. OMG..... Did Niki Caro think that she was filming an animated film? *shake head*Third, there are 2 huge action stars in this movie (Jet Li & Donnie Yen), why is it neither of them was invited to choreograph the stunts?!? Everytime I watch the fight scenes, I get so frustrated because they made every single one of them look like an easy defeat, no development, nothing challenging & exciting at all! Yet again, a waste of great talents (Jet Li & Donnie Yen).Fourth, lousy editing! During the scene when Mulan's family were talking about her father's enlistment, the different angle shots they used were so terribly wrong! In one shot Mulan's arms were crossed, then in another shot it wasn't crossed, and the next one was crossed again! Seriously?!?Last but not least, can't they do a better job at finding the right actor for Honghui's role?!? There was no chemistry between An Yoson & Liu Yifei at all! OMG....In short, ""Just like that?"" repeatedly came into my mind throughout the whole movie.
Mulan managed to conceal her identity and blend into the army ""just like that""?
Mulan felt compelled to reveal her identity ""just like that""?
The commander and the others believed her suspicion ""just like that""?
Bori Khan and his army arrived at the Imperial City ""just like that""?
The witch suddenly betrayed Bori Khan ""just like that""?
Mulan defeated Bori Khan single-handedly without her sword ""just like that""?SLOPPISH WORK NIKI CARO! Utterly disappointed..............",Mulan

Also who is that witch and witches was not something bad in China and they weren't called witches , that is an American thing . And most annoying of all is that POWER everyone called Ki , Ki is just the inner energy of humans and it needs a lot of practice. And last but not least were are the songs???

That directly impacts the story telling. The director has no idea on how to build tension. Any threat faced is instantly acted upon, there's no time to consider danger and so the film feels as though there is no threat.Constantly questionable decisions: I have no idea why anyone does anything in this film. You have characters entering lakes, getting completely soaked to say 10 words, then leave the lake. Why? Why would anyone do that? And it goes on like this. Great action scenes are spoiled by choppy cuts, to add speed to moves that are already very fast.There's just no way to enjoy anything. It feels cheap and emotionaless. Very odd film making.It's a true shame a film like this has a massive budget whilst many other great films struggle for a budget and suffer from wonky cgi.",Mulan

301,TheBillionthGuyNamedJack,Just When I Thought Disney Was Being Original...,3,1 January 2021,"I remember seeing the trailer for Mulan and thinking that was going to be a more original, serious, and gritty take on the tale of Mulan and Disney would not try to tell a fantasy story like the original did and succeeded at. I was wrong. It does everything the original does and only deviates away from the parts that made the original so good. The film tries to be gritty with muddy characters and scenes of murder more explicitly shown, but everyone acts like a cartoon with exaggerated personalities and reactions. Mulan doesn't have a struggle in the story, she is born Neo from the Matrix and doesn't need to train at all. The movie tries to rush this ""the hero and villain are the same"" complex into the story as well. There are a few things to like, such as the occasionally good filmography and the cool acrobatic and gravity defying fight scenes. But overall, this was a terrible movie that, while was cool sometimes, was awful. If you want a movie that will make you laugh in hysteria while your childhood gets brutally murdered by corporate greed, this is the ""film"" for you.",Mulan
302,ReliableReview,Absolutely Atrocious! Just Terrible! Avoid this Turkey.,3,4 September 2020,Critics showering this with praise are wrong. I could barely get through this movie without fast forwarding. Acting is wooden all around. The lead actress looks like she's just reading off a script. The pacing is slow and the story bland. It's completely humorless with no musical song and dance. Best way to describe it is it's soulless. And the fight scenes do not redeem it either. If you've seen any of Jet Li's late 80's and early 90's movies it's intense with edge of your seat action and gorgeous fight choreography. The climactic ending battle was short and boring and frankly does not cut it in 2020. I kept thinking there would be another more exciting fight at the end but nope. Some platitudes of wisdom were uttered and then The End. On the positives the costumes and cinematography are beautiful but that alone cannot save this movie.Mulan has a similar feel to that Keanu Reeves' movie 47 Ronin which was also terrible but at least I did not fall asleep in the theater and it is a bit better than Mulan. What's surprising is this $200 million budgeted movie does not look or feel like a $200 million movie. Effort was clearly put into creating colorful visuals but the story at its core is hollow and the lack of humor robs it of the original's charm. It's too serious and the weak fight scenes and choreography just sinks this movie. No it's not worth $30. Frankly if I knew it was this bad I would not have watched it even for free.,Mulan
303,watcher101,"Disney, what are you DOING!?!",3,4 September 2020,"Uch, it was bad. And I had high hopes for this one, at least as an action film. But nope, it was an all around mess. First of all, it's Woke (of course it is), but that's only the start of the problems. Sometimes they have lame fighting styles, other times they just randomly throw in something out of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and not in a good way, but it's all really boring. They also took out all the interesting characters, like Mushu, Shang, Cricket, Mulan's grandmother, Mulan's 3 army friends, and instead we get these pointless nobodies who have little to no role other than simply being there. They even gave Mulan a sister, but she adds absolutely nothing; you can take her out of the movie and it changes nothing. Oh, and there's no Shan Yu either, instead we get these two generic, boring villains with no character. And let's not forget the inclusion of chi and actual magic and witchcraft. And, of course, Mulan is an overpowered Mary Sue who, even as a child, was performing moves that would put Jackie Chan to shame. I mean, why not give her actual development in training and stuff to show her becoming a good fighter when you can just make her super OP Mary Sue right off the bat, right? The acting itself is bland, and even the dialogue is horrible. Everyone talks in these tone-deaf monotone voices with no emotion in them. You really feel nothing for any these characters. The movie has none of the charm of the original, and they don't even have any of the songs. Seriously, the movie is an utter disaster, and completely boring. They would have been better off doing a shot-for-shot remake like they did with the live-action Lion King. Get your act together, Disney, you're sinking your own ship.",Mulan

305,TheOnlyOwen01,I'm so glad I didn't spend money on this,1,6 December 2020,"Mulan (2020) is cringeworthy from start to finish. With the exception of Donnie Yen's decent performance and some solid production design, there's nothing of quality here. The rest of the performances are lifeless and terrible, the editing and directing is absolutely atrocious, the visual effects are garbage and the film is so boring that I was tempted to stop about half way through.When I heard they were making a darker and more ""realistic"" (putting quotations because this movie is the opposite of realistic), I got hyped since Mulan is my favorite of the 2D Disney movies and a genuinely great movie from a filmmaking perspective. I was fine with there being no Mushu and the cricket and Mulan's three friends because if you're going to remake something, you should bring something new to the table and I figured they would do that from the trailer. Right? Right? Nope! Where to begin!First off, Mulan is a complete and total Mary Sue. If you thought Rey in the sequels was OP, you haven't seen anything yet. There's a scene where she jumps on a table and is balancing some cups with her two hands and one of her feet while standing on her other foot. How could she do that? Was she trained? It's almost like she has superpowers. Oh wait, considering what she can do later on in the movie, she apparently does. It also doesn't help that the lead actress is terrible in this movie. In fact, all of the performances outside of Donnie Yen are terrible.I think the main issue with the movie is it's editing and directing. It's so disgusting that I'm shocked that this was going to be in theaters before COVID happened. There's so many quick cutting that it's impossible to understand what's happening. During the final battle, I couldn't make out anything unless someone was talking in front of the camera. I would go as far as to say this is the worst editing I've seen since Transformers: The Last Knight. How did this feel okay with them? Guess that's because they didn't care about the movie itself and instead wanted to make money because that's the only reason these live action remakes exist.Then there's the visual effects. Wow! There are moments where the characters are so obviously in front of a green screen that it's actually embarrassing to watch. There's also a phoenix bird that appears frequently that adds nothing to the story. It has no reason to be there and the effect looks horrible. The movie would've benefited if it wasn't there in the first place. Actually, the movie would've been better altogether if it wasn't made at all.Best thing about the movie: the voice actress for Mulan in the original makes a cameo towards the end. She's only on screen for a few seconds but it's the only surprise in the movie that didn't make me roll my eyes however one ""blink and you'll miss her"" cameo isn't enough to give the movie a watch. Thankfully she's also working on The Mandalorian because this movie was painful to watch. Disney, get it together. Start making good movies again!",Mulan

308,rockinkettles-1,Mulan was a great movie!,10,5 September 2020,"While many movies have been postponed these past months, finally the release of Mulan was worth the wait. Great movie. Much different from the animated classic. There are no songs, no Mushu and no comic relief. It is a straight forward action adventure drama that delivers. So far, it is my favorite and best movie of the year. People who reviewed it that were disappointed and calling it a bad movie don't know what the hell they're talking about. This movie was better without the songs. It wouldn't have been the same and would not have fit in as just a copy of the animated Mulan. I like the animated film too, but I liked the live action version even more. There are great battle scenes and Mulan is fun to watch in action. So if you're a fan of the original and expect to hear songs and get comic relief from Mushu, you probably won't like it. I would love to have seen this on the big screen. It was definitely made for it. An epic that is one of the best if not the best movie of the year!",Mulan
309,jaredkjacoby,Possibly Disney's Worst Live-action Remake,3,11 January 2021,"A young woman named Hua Mulan is not too traditional for a girl in her culture. She is born with Chi which gives her some strength. She is adventurous and skilled. When she is a woman, Mulan must meet with a matchmaker, but with a spider causing Mulan and her sister to freak out, the tea drops and she is called a disgrace. As her father gets drafted for the war, she steals his place to protect him and sets off for the training camp disguised as a man.Okay... I really wanted to give this film a chance. I do not mind all of the changes made from the original film. There are multiple versions of Mulan out there and this is supposed to be a more mature take on the character. I am fine with that. The problem is that this version of Mulan made me feel so empty. I never cared about the characters or story at any point. The story is so much more boring here. It tries to be a darker version of the animated film with some changes to the characters, but it only sucks the life out of them as well as the story. It tries to focus more on bigger stakes and more action, but it ends up feeling more like a cliched and generic blockbuster. Here is one plot point that really shows how bad this film is. The burnt village is here as it was in the last film and it is shown for less than a minute. Not only that, but it is way less subtle as the characters talk about how sad it is instead of walking around the village like the first film. They botched this scene badly. Worst of all, this really did not feel like Mulan. It felt like a bad attempt at a foreign martial arts film made in the West. Even the world building feels underwhelming. I really wanted to get into the story, but I just could not for the life of me.As for the characters, Mushu and Shang are gone and the characters here are not interesting at all. Mulan herself is pretty bland here. One thing that made her great in the animated film is that she started out clueless, but she grew as both a person and a fighter. She had a journey to build her strength. Here, she is born with Chi and she is a strong martial artist from the start. Not only does this make her more of a Mary Sue here, but it also makes the character less inspiring. The animated Mulan was a normal woman who made a huge risk. Although she needed help, she ultimately became the warrior she is known as when she started out as a klutz. Seeing a character like that could inspire people that can become really strong and competent if they train. Here, she is a strong fighter from the start. I never saw the progression of her character because of that. It also makes her less relatable. She is a very boring protagonist here and her personality is nonexistent. This take on Mulan is very disappointing.The rest cast of characters are just as boring. There is a guy who is slightly creepy that tries too hard to befriend Mulan, there are Mulan's pals who are even flatter here than they were in the animated film, there is Böri Khan who is one-dimensional and there is commander who is nowhere near as interesting as Li Shang. The only character that is interesting at all is the witch character. She is a sympathetic enough character who seems to respect Mulan, but even she is underdeveloped. That is the biggest problem with this movie. None of these characters have that much depth to them except maybe Mulan and her dad. It also does not help that the acting is not that great. The cast is very promising with actors such as Donnie Yen and Jet Li, but the performances feel wooden here. It feels like everyone is acting in a play rather than a motion picture. Liu Yifei does not bring a lot to the table as the title character as far as emotions and personality go. However, I will give her props for her stunt work. I heard that Yifei did her own stunts in this film and you get see. She does some impressive work here. It is clear that she is very dedicated to the role, but I think her performance just misses the spot. Maybe I am being a little too hard on the cast, but I just was not impressed.Production-wise, it is a mixed bag. It has some beautiful scenery and set designs, but it also has some really bad special effects. I am sorry, but there was not a minute of this film where the Phoenix looked remotely convincing. It looked like something out of a PS3 video game. The hawk looks no better. Most of the cgi is fine, but these birds should have looked way better considering the film's huge budget. The costumes are pretty solid though. They look very professional and real for this kind of film. The cinematography is disappointing. There are some impressive shots here and there, but the movie looks bleak with the colors and the composition. This movie has so little life to it with the filming aspect. As for the action scenes, there is plenty of them, but they are not all that exciting. There are moments or shots here and there that looks pretty cool with the impressive stunt work, but the editing is pretty bad. It cuts from frame to frame too quickly to enjoy the fight. Also, some of the moves are repetitive as well such as Mulan kicking the arrow. The soundtrack is fine, but nothing extraordinary. It is pretty pleasant to listen to while watching the movie, but I prefer the animated film's soundtrack.Overall, this version of Mulan is a mess. It is not bad because it is nothing like the animated classic. It is bad because it takes an interesting tone to the character and does nothing unique or original with it. It lacks energy and depth on its own right. The ending is also terrible which made me lower my score slightly. It sends a bad message for women because it does not give them a choice. By the resolution, I just wanted the credits to roll. Just stick with the animated Mulan or seek out a live-action version made by Chinese directors. Those are probably much better than this dull action thriller.",Mulan

311,dtrani,A movie with both good and bad elements.,6,8 September 2020,"Mulan is film that is very interesting at the least. The filmmakers try to take this film at a different approach than what the original Mulan fans are used to. Although different is not bad, and I very much respect the fact that they changed it up rather than creating a complete copy of the animated film, this movie is very mixed in what it does. Before I begin to really ""critique"" the film, let me explain the good elements of this film.
Right off the bat, the first I will say is that the cinematography is amazing in this film. Out of the many recent Disney remakes, this film that had one of the most visually appealing cinematography. There were so many ""WOAH"" shots that took my breath away. Even better, the colors complimented it so well and made everything feel alive. I also enjoyed the casting and overall performance from the actors. Although it was a little annoying to hear some actors with American accents and some with Chinese accents, it wasn't as big of a deal to me. Unfortunately these features were not enough to
Now onto the cons. I feel that sometimes this film doesn't know what it wants to be. It tends to avoid many of the magic elements from the animated original (the ancestors, mushu, etc.) and made it look like a historical. But then again they added other elements like chi and witches. This confused me a little bit. They made it seem like a historical-type drama in the trailers but continued with the fantasy. And if I must say so, the animated film felt much more ""historical"" than this one. I don't know much Chinese history, but this film did not convince me that they were living in a real place. As I said, I feel they didn't establish what type of film they were trying to make. It doesn't feel magical but it also doesn't feel completely gritty and real either.
Our main character Mulan also suffers from a terrible syndrome that has been seen in many other Disney films (StarWars episodes 7-9). Unfortunately Mulan suffers from the Mary Sue syndrome, which states that she is a character that is too ""perfect"". Right from the beginning young Mulan already knows everything and has it all perfect. She is a skilled fighter with great reflexes prior to even going through training. Even then, the training scene does not show herself as learning anything. It seems almost as if that scene was useless and more or less a tribute to the original film. The original film did a better job of showing the struggle she went through, being that she was a woman competing with men. If they would've fixed this, it could've saved it a little more in my opinion.
In general, this film was an enjoyable Disney film to watch with family. But as a cinema-lover myself, I can't say that I was sold on it. Images were beautiful but was not enough to save it. 5/10",Mulan
312,ryrymadrid,Boring and generic,2,7 September 2020,"I really wanted this movie to be good since I hated the other Disney remakes, but this is by far the most boring and generic plot of all of them. Not exciting or fun in anyway. Bland, bland, bland. Stay away and save your money.",Mulan
313,Chanandler-Bong,"Enjoyable, family-friendly watch",7,12 December 2020,"Out of the live action remakes (which personally I wish they'd stop doing) this has been my favourite so far. Putting aside the original Disney Mulan, as a stand alone film this was pretty good. Is it a game-changing, amazing film? No. Is it as good as the original animated? No. But it's still a good film. I like some of the references to the original animated film, such as in the music, and I liked the use of the kite for the phoenix.Also, putting aside the controversy about the lead actress Yifei Liu, she was OK. I would have liked a little more emotion from her, but overall she did good.I had a couple of issues with it, confusing things, unneeded roles, inconsistencies. I felt the story itself was made far too complicated, which I think leads to its downfall. The animated original has a simple story, which is partly why it is better.Some of the fighting was a bit ridiculous. Weapons not even close to someone yet they make dramatic movements, a lot of flying through the sky etc. I don't mind a little over dramatisation, but it was a little much.I felt the witch didn't really have a place in this film. All she really did was help them get through the garrisons and in some wYs ""uncover"" Mulans true self. But there could have been better ways of doing that. Mulan could have also got to Bori Khan without the witch. I guess they wanted more strong females in the film. There were also inconsistencies in it, such as when Mulan returned to tell them about Bori Khans plan, she told them a ton of information yet the witch barely told her anything?Anyway, it is an enjoyable watch that both kids and adults can enjoy. It is a Disney film after all, it has to be for all ages. Just don't take it too seriously. And remember, you can't have courage without fear.",Mulan

Not this horribly boring crap they pulled. The original cartoon was more grounded than this crap. Let that sink in for a moment, the cartoon with a talking dragon and dancing ghosts was more realistic than this movie. The fact that they decided to do a fantasy kungfu movie but disney style (read half-assed) makes this movie fall on its face from the very first opening scene and then crawl to the finish line 2 hours later (which is 2 hours too many). The story makes zero sense, none, the characters change opinions and allegiances on a whim. The main character behaves like a dick for some reason from the very beginning. There is no reason or logic behind anything in the movie. This movie has exactly 2 saving graces hence 2 stars score. The orchestral references to the original songs (albeit all are brief) and the Ming Na Wen cameo at the end. I can not stress how bad this movie is.",Mulan
316,djbvk21,Was a really good movie- Don't believe they nay sayers here,9,18 September 2020,"Was well written, after and the beauty of colors and scenery was amazing.
Did it follow the cartoon 100% ? No. Thankfully.
People here will say she worked hard and became a great warrior but here it was by magic. That's a lie. As a child she was taught by her father and she had a very strong inner Chi- where she honed her talent from a young age. So no her strength never came from magic. But yet when the nay sayers talk about magic and not hard work they neglect to talk about the cartoon's magical creatures helping her on her journey. So again they are wrong.
The cartoon and movie are not aligned with any mythological character's story line so why 'try' to use that against the movie but not that cartoon.
The movie goes more in-depth about honor, chi, male-female roles, FEMALE empowerment love of family, love of country, good vs bad etc etc.
it's a definite watch. Sit back with or without the kids and enjoy. Don't be a Debbie downer- sorry to all Debbies",Mulan
317,jacknlowe,Don't listen to the haters,8,15 September 2020,"Don't listen to the haters! Watch the movie for yourself. It's a great movie. Stunning visuals, great action scenes and decent storyline.My main gripe (and my kid's)...where are the songs?!!! My kid missed Mushu, but I kind of get why they did not put him in. They wanted a more serious film. BUT....so many scenes would have been made more dramatic or intense with a song thrown in. At the very least...the most well known and definitive song from the animated version (Reflections) should have been included. Perhaps during the moment when she decides to take her father's sword and armor to take his place in the army.I hope Disney makes a 2nd version to be released to theaters (after Covid is under control with vaccine)...and inserts the songs in it!!!!",Mulan
318,burkholdermicah,They Tried. I'll Give Them That.,7,4 September 2020,"I'm glad this isn't some shot-for-shot remake like 2019's The Lion King. I'm glad they actually stuck with the Ballad of Mulan story rather than it be a remake of the animated movie. I'm glad that most of this movie's budget went around the way the land of ancient China should be presented. The music is great, the cinematography is beautiful, the visuals are incredible, the acting is solid, the editing and sound effects are good... and that's pretty much it.I'm giving this movie a 7/10 because it's better than most of the other Disney remakes (with Beauty and the Beast being the one that I happened to REALLY like), and because there is a lot to like about it. The only thing not great about this movie is the writing and the way some things are executed. I wish they spent more time developing the characters and used more of that time to develop the villain. The villain in the cartoon movie was so well-crafted and well-written, but the villain in the remake feels like there's a whole lot missing from him.It's a solid, mildly entertaining movie overall and definitely better than that garbage Artemis Fowl movie!",Mulan
319,gelmcchristop,A bold production,8,17 January 2021,"This movie is not your standard, old-fashioned film. The directing, editing and cinematography were by no means conventional, as most of the many action sequences were characterized by intense camera rotations and odd pacing. These have generated a negative perception of the film for the filmmakers' community, yet this ""fresh air"" does pay off some of the times, giving the audience a unique experience. And despite the blunders it led to sometimes (hence the 8 stars), overall this nerve was a great asset to the film. Another thing i'd like to point out about the cinematography were the colors, with the implementation of the entire color palette in many sequences resulting in an interesting (although not so engaging) output. The vfx were very solid, and also beautiful. As far as the plot is concerned, all i have to say is this is pure American cinema with a touch of comedy, so keeping that in mind there is no reason to be offended by or show the movie all the undeserved hate it has gotten.",Mulan

Without her this wouldn't have been possible. Yiefi is the best mulan. I also loved Yoson an as honghui. This film contains great characters and emotions. The score deserves oscar. The film is so good that I can watch it everyday . If this film had a traditional theatrical release, it could gross more than 1 billion dollars in the box office. The production design and vfx were great. You don't get to see such an epic everyday. Mulan is the most promising character of all time as she is LOYAL , BRAVE AND TRUE.",Mulan

322,cauwboy,This is NOT the realistic film of Mulan that we were promised,4,6 September 2020,"As I go through the user reviews here, it's obvious that many are disappointed that it's not like the animated film from the 90s - it still needs to be said that it was a good choice of the filmmakers to do something new instead of a scene-by-scene remake like The Lion King (2019). So let's see the film for what it is and not what people wanted it to be.Going through the cast alone, it's obvious that this film gathered a lot of amazing actors. Yifei Liu, Donnie Yen, Jet Li, Li Gong, Pei-Pei Cheng. These are some really big names in the Chinese cinema. We also have the two writers behind the new Planet of the Apes trilogy that came out during the 2010s, plus two other screenwriters that don't have any known credits before this film. And then there's the director, Niki Caro, known for emotional dramas based on real events. Oh, and all of this is produced by Disney.Disney is such a difficult word, because usually when something gets done by Disney, it's almost certain that it will be a big hit or at least seen by a lot more than if a smaller studio did it. But then again, if you think of any famous director and then put their names together with Disney, it still ends up more like a Disney film than a film by that director alone, it's like their soul is slowly ripped away from the films by Disney and I feel it's the same with Mulan.It made a lot of sense when the news was announced that Niki was hired as an director and that they were going to make the film more realistic, no songs, no magical creatures, closer to reality - that sounds like something that would fit with Niki's other films and it would also be Disney's most mature film about a girl becoming a man, becoming a warrior, becoming a woman. But then something must've happened. There's a witch that can turn into a bird and Mulan got a strong ""chi"" that works like the force. I have a hard time believing that this is what Niki had in mind when she wanted to make this film more realistic, then good for her, but to me it ends up becoming the opposite.Others have already pointed out that there was never any worry that Mulan was in any real danger, because she was so strong to begin with, having strong chi, she started off great and never developed, unless you call that scene where she takes off her armor as development. I have a hard time seeing how young girls (and boys) can see themselves in someone like this Mulan when she's already so strong and special, instead of having her starting off as nobody and becoming that special someone. If anything it only alienates people instead of giving them hope.Sadly this is yet another disappointment among the many other Disney live-action films, with Niki Caro now joining the group of famous directors like Tim Burton, Kenneth Branagh, Jon Favreau, Marc Forster and Guy Ritchie with much better films outside of Disney's claws.And seriously! What is up with Jet Li's voice, why did they have to dub him? At least try to find a voice that's close to what he would sounds like, this was just distracting when he suddenly had such a deep, grumbly voice.",Mulan
323,natsuka_arei,It's not that bad!,8,13 September 2020,"I think the movie is quite good. Aside from any political controversy this movie had, this version brings a different portrayal of Mulan. In this story, Mulan portrayed as a ready-made superhuman warrior with Chi. This is the opposite of the classic Mulan where the character even though got talent and potential, still, needs hard work to gain the achievement.The story itself focused on the fourth virtues: Courage, true to yourself, loyal, and devotion to the family. I understand why fans enrage and unsatisfied by this movie because I admit they make huge changes from the classic one. These changes include:a. They substitute Mushu with not-so-useful Phoenix (who, literally do nothing in the movie and just occasionally appear)
b. Add new characters like The Witch. I think Disney added this character to emphasize the message ""true to yourself"" but fail to impress the audience. I kind of like this character, but her development throughout the movie feels forced and half-baked which make people think her appearance in the movie is unnecessary. Also, how she ends up, really really predictable.
c. LESS ROMANCE, as a big fan of romance, quite disappoints me. They change Shang with Honghui, there are scenes indicating romance but not much, and the story never focuses on itLast but not least, the thing that bothers me maybe the fighting scenes. Illogical and forced. I will give you two examples of this.
a. When Mulan and some troops chased Bori Khan troops, all the Mulan's troops got shot by an arrow and fall from the horse (the remaining two just run). Only Mulan able to dodge the arrows (how silly because even though they want to highlight Mulan's skill, they make Mulan's troops look really lame compared to Bori Khan troops where some of them had the ability to dodge arrows)
b. Mulan appears unrealistically beautiful and clean even in the midst of war (She didn't cut her hair like in the classic, not even tie it). She also seemed not bothered by her long hair which several times cover her eyes. How the hell someone like that even survive and able to fight in a war.Overall, this movie is still entertaining in its own way as long as you can ignore the differences from the classic one.SIDE NOTES: I still prefer Donnie Yen and Jet Li play for action/kung fu movies. I feel so strange saw Jet Li act as an emperor, somehow warrior or Kung Fu master suits him better (in my eyes). The same feeling for Donnie Yen, he felt so rigid in the movie. I think this movie kinds of wasted two great martial artists.",Mulan

327,star_hazard,Pretentious candy,4,11 September 2020,"The parts I like:
The beginning. I liked how they showed Mulan as a child.. it gave background. I like the ending song. The visuals. It looks nice.So everything else..oh god. Some people are applauding the acting but the only thing I see is robotic expression. The delivery of the lines feel too mechanical. The part where they were discussing what is their ideal women was laughable. They tried so hard to show casual..ness but it failed for me. What even were those lines. The lyrical lines doesn't fit at all.They butchered the mountain scene too. Nobody saw Mulan's sacrifice. You can't even feel the rush when the snow fell. It looked good but there was no anxiety for it. I mean Mulan's horse is literally just running in the avalanche like it was normal ground. I didn't once feel any stress. She doesn't even looked stressed at all!They just pushed so much ""Mulan the feminist"" like adding weird details. Like the scene where she reveals herself as a woman and asks to be executed or with the ending where the guard says the emperor is waiting for her to choose what she wants to do.I guess the music was also bad because it didn't help carry the tones to guide the vibe of the scene especially with fight scenes. It was just bland fighting scenes.There's a lot of wrongs that happened. Overall I can say that this is just a pretentious movie. They told us they opted to divert from the Disney animated version to make it more Original.. represent the Chinese culture and yet it's not. I have watched the 2009 Live action Mulan and I cried. I felt that movie more than this 2020. I felt the grittiness and the REALNESS the 2020 was supposedly going for. This 2020 version is lacking. There's no Disney magic. There's no real vibe. It's just in between. Like a dream",Mulan
328,adog2001,Finished watching it and I think this is the best Disney remake by far.,9,5 September 2020,"Just finished watching the remake of Mulan. And shall I say, it was SO worth the wait! I loved every minute of it and I teared up a few times watching it, especially close to the ending tears were coming down. I shall say, I found it a LOT better than the original. Even though there were no songs and no Mushu, the fighting and everything else happening around it made that not matter to me. I was also glad they changed a lot in this movie compared to the original. It made the movie more interesting to me.
I will rate the remake of Mulan probably a 9 out of 10. I loved it that much and I don't think there was anything I did not like about the movie.",Mulan
329,adog2001,Such a good movie. I especially loved the changes.,9,5 September 2020,"I don't understand the hate for this movie or the 5.0 rating on here. I think maybe it is because of the fact there is no songs or Mushu, or the whole situation that started the boycott Mulan trend.
As someone who has been a long time fan of the original, this in my opinion was a lot better than the original. I say this because I loved the new characters, especially Xianniang the new villian played by the legendary Gong Li. She was a very great villain.
I also really loved Liu Yifei in this movie, a few of her moments especially one of her moments at the end really got my teary eyed. She was amazing as Mulan and Niki Caro was right that she was without a doubt the best Mulan. I give full credit to Caro for choosing her and I don't give a crap on what anyone has to say about her.
While there are a lot of changes, there is also scenes from the original changed up a bit. Like the matchmaker scene instead of it being with a cricket, it was with a spider instead. Some of the fight scenes were similar but most were brand new for this remake.
Good job Mulan! You brought honor to my family. I give this movie a 9 out of 10. Will definitely buy on DVD when it comes out in December.",Mulan

331,chrisw-17947,I completely understand the division,7,6 September 2020,"To start things off, this is not a perfect movie and is not as significant as the original but it is a much better live-action remake than last years Aladdin, Lion King, and Lady and the Tramp. I had mixed feelings before watching this after hearing about the changes between the original Mulan and how it was going to be much more serious and lacked any of the best supporting characters. But I actually was intrigued with Mulan 2020!The cinematography is beautiful and the lighting is immaculate. It's also not strictly serious, this actually witty and goofy at times and structured the same balance between dramatic and comedic moments for an action movie just like the original Mulan. Another thing compared to the original is that both versions had me emotional sometimes as well. They also didn't do a shot-for-shot remake and actually had moments of scenes where they filmed their own scene instead of just copying it from its predecessor.What throws me off about this remake is that it slides off the grid for its maturity and realism because some (not all) of the stunts look comical as if I was watching a Marvel movie's fight scene. And when Disney was trying to be respectful to the Chinese culture I wished that the whole cast spoke Chinese instead of English. Another thing is that the action scenes feel rushed and too fast-paced. Sometimes the acting threw me off because sometimes some of the characters sound like they're just reciting lines instead of acting how their characters need to feel.With that being said, I completely understand how this is divisive but I don't interpret Mulan as a bad remake! I do wish Disney would stop remaking movies we've already seen however",Mulan
332,nyarnebbanot,Dishonor,4,28 April 2021,"Corona was sweeping everything this year. And it was sweeping movie theatres. Now people must pay for this on Disney+ for as much as a family with snacks.Mulan 2020 is a big disappointment but also a tear jerker at the same time. Don't go in expecting it to be a beat for beat remake of the 1998 animated film or the actual legend of Hua Mulan. No it's a cheesy film as cheesy as Power Rangers.Mulan was the most graceful girl in the village. So graceful she did Kung Fu at age 8. Assuming 10 years later she had so much grace she grew up to be women with a fixed marriage. But this wan't for her. Suddenly the Huns attacked Zhonhua with a Atila's witchthat transforms into a bird? Wha-? Oh never mind. It's just Disney movie. At least there is no annoying ghosts, Eddie Murphy dragon, or sing alongs.There's an entire scene where she goes through valleys,mountains, and deserts. So Mulan must join the army despite not being male. She must pretend to be a man. An effeminate man. But she talks like a girl the entire time! Only a few minutes will she speak like a man.Anyway, no surprise she doesn't have the cringey scene where she turns out to be a girl via her you know what? In the tent scene. Instead she tells you clothed.Anyway, Mulan is not the charming tail. Sure there are some nice shots but it seems to be as low budget as Velvet Buzzsaw because I don't believe any of these safe for kids Kung Fu scenes. A Marvel movie fight seems more believable.Advertising sold this movie. Not itself because that's what Disney only cares about really anymore. Not the assets. It's why they won't make movies 2D anymore. Too much work for human detail. It's all computers now.One positive about it is being true to yourself and your family. Before Reflections in the 90's was just another wanting more song but now it's meaningful. Now it's about being yourself in a world you don't belong . Today's world is all about identity politics and acceptance. It's not about getting what you want but having yourself. Like knowing your race, your religion, but most importantly your sexuality and gender.Overall I would would wait til this becomes free on Disney+ or torrent it.

338,gogarrett,"Excellent story, directing, photography. Pays homage to first Mulan",9,21 September 2020,"I was about to explode waiting for this movie, which originally was to premiere in theaters April 2020. So of course I paid to see it before the free December 2020 release on my Disney+ account.I was NOT DISAPPOINTED. I have not read the dismal reviews of others and it would not matter. I loved the animated Disney Mulan story and music, but was annoyed by the whole ancestral dragon and good luck cricket comedy relief throughout. This movie left all of that out with the more dignified image of the phoenix, sent by a loving father, looking after Mulan; and instead of a cricket we saw a likeable young man named ""Cricket"". Brilliant! Another aspect of paying homage to the first movie was using words and background music from the first movie very effectively, especially in the ""I'm going to make a man out of you"" sequence.Another thing I really, really loved about this movie was that it gave more background for how Mulan was able to achieve all that she did. She inherited it either genetically or through a strong love and admiration for her father, and appeared to have been secretly trained by him? This movie showed a father who was very progressive for his time and culture by being proud of his daughter for her strong qualities/abilities (her Chi), even though society did not approve of those qualities in girls. This similarly happened in the movie ""Brave"" between father and daughter only in that case the daughter developed obvious strong qualities gained from both parents, not just the father.I was intrigued by the Huns being helped by a witch who often presented as a hawk or falcon and who interacted and eventually was transformed by Mulan's stronger moral character. In the animated version, it was just a smart hawk spy for the Huns. The Huns were fleshed out pretty well and seemed like a real threat in the story, just as in the animated movie.And finally, I was very happy they dropped the whole love interest part out of this Mulan movie. Mulan's goals were to show honor for family and country and to save her father. She was very focused and not distracted. These are very admirable qualities and very exciting to see in a Disney movie, that too often has to throw in ""and they lived happily ever after"" endings for the female leads. I am sure there are those that were hoping she turned out to be a Lesbian or something, but the stronger ending is to leave sexuality out completely and show how strong a female can be in traditionally male skills/ roles. This movie did that well.I will be watching this movie over and over. Kudos to all involved with it's production!",Mulan
339,Chuck_EM,Not bad,5,5 December 2020,"This movie wasn't too bad. Others are right: Yifei Liu can't act. You can tell this from the first five words she utters. My favorite part was the bo staff spinning by the young Mulan in the first five minutes of the movie. It was hard to tell who it was, maybe an anonymous martial artist. The martial arts went downhill from then on. Even Donnie Yen didn't do much showing off. It could have been a lot better in that regard. There was a lack of music too. All in all it was better than most Disney movies, but they set the bar so low these days it's hard to see it down in the grass. (The Mandalorian is an exception though.)",Mulan

The witch plot is so incredibly thin: she is so powerful that she could do anything -including killing the emperor and nobody would even know it was murder, then take his place. She is also way too powerful to whine about being lonely. She could have just flown like a bird to a different country or continent, and easily make a new life for herself!
Mulan is an ok actor, had the script not been awful, but I suspect she is kind of unengaging. I didnt fall in love with her...or any of the characters.

It's clearer than ever that these Disney remakes are now just constant cash grabs. In NO WAY is this movie worth $30...maybe more like $3. It changes all the wrong things making it a much lesser version of the original. At least it stays true to the message of Mulan's tale and includes some cool action scenes. But with no music, no charm, and no heart, this movie wasn't even close to capturing the magic of the original. As a remake, it sucked, and as a standalone movie separate from its predecessors, it still sucked. If you're a fan of Mulan, I would stay far, far away from this remake.

348,wesseldj-48581,A well worthy tribute to the legendary Mulan,10,5 September 2020,"At first I didn't knew why the viewer ratings were so low, so I was curious to see this movie for myself. Then I discovered that most user ratings were politically motivated, and nothing but anti-china bots, with nonsensical reasons to make this movie look bad. In that regard they failed their purpose, because its free publicity and it made me actually wanting to see the movie even more.After watching the movie myself, I can truly say it was beautifully made!The movie had good build up, majestically filmed. Yifei as Mulan was charistmatic and her charms added depth to the character Mulan. She sometimes speaks volumes without saying anything, and when she does say something its meaningful, those are rare qualities of an actor.At times it gave me goosebumps to finally see a live action version of Mulan, I have to admit I had to wipe some occasional tears away throughout the movie.Yifei companions were funny and their commaderie was heartfelt.Fun fact: Honghui was historically the love interest of Mulan, not Shang Li from the animated movie ;-)Eventhough without the musical songs that made the animated version popular, but there were enough references to the animation throughout the movie that did honor to the animated version.
All the actors were great and solid, especially the father played by Tzi Ma was convincing as a caring and inspirational father to Mulan in such a short timespan of character development.Sad fact: Historically Mulan fought a war campaign of 12 years. She never did get to see her father again, because when she got home her father already died of old age. Traumatized by warefare, Mulan never became her old self, and she committed suicide, hoping she could reunite with her father in the afterlife being that carefree loving daughter again....The encounter with the Witch (Xinniang) played by Gong Li was superbly done. I think the witch might even have been a metaphor for Mulans inner fears.

349,wesseldj-48581,A well worthy tribute to the legendary Mulan,10,6 September 2020,"At first I didn't knew why the viewer ratings were so low, so I was curious to see this movie for myself. Then I discovered that most user ratings were politically motivated, and nothing but anti-china bots, with nonsensical reasons to make this movie look bad. In that regard they failed their purpose, because its free publicity and it made me actually wanting to see the movie even more.After watching the movie myself, I can truly say it was beautifully made! The movie had good build up, majestically filmed. Yifei as Mulan was charismatic and her charms added depth to the character Mulan. She sometimes speaks volumes without saying anything, and when she does say something its meaningful, those are rare qualities of an actor.At times it gave me goosebumps to finally see a live action version of Mulan, I have to admit I had to wipe some occasional tears away throughout the movie.Mulans companions were funny and their camaraderie was heartfelt.Fun fact: Honghui was historically the love interest of Mulan, not Shang Li from the animated movie ;-)Even though without the musical songs that made the animated version popular, but there were enough references to the animation throughout the movie that made it satisfying watch and did honor to the animated version.All the actors were great and solid, especially the father played by Tzi Ma was convincing as a caring and inspirational father to Mulan in such a short timespan of character development.Sad fact: Historically Mulan fought a war campaign of 12 years. She never did get to see her father again, because when she got home her father already died of old age. Traumatized by warfare, Mulan never became her old self, she got depressed and committed suicide, hoping she could reunite with her father in the afterlife being that carefree loving daughter again....The encounter with the Witch (Xianniang) played by Gong Li was superbly done. I think the witch might even have been a metaphor for Mulans inner fears. It was so poetically well executed.I am glad Jetli got to do some of his last few action sequences, as Jetli is suffering from returning illnesses, the reason why he doesn't do much action nowadays.Bori Khans character is the equivalent of Shan Yu in the animated version, and is in the live action more fleshed out as to what his motivations were for attacking the kingdom, that was a nice touch.Also nice references to chinese Wuxia genre, where lifeforce and chi are prominent for martial art masters.For the people that missed Mushu, there is a reference of a phoenix though that helped Mulan, and in chinese folklore phoenix represents a woman.I recommend this movie highly for the fans of the original animation and for people who are new to the story of Mulan.For me it was a well worthy tribute to both the legendary chinese folklore story Mulan aswell as the original disney animated version!",Mulan
350,tashlast,30 dollars and 2 hours I'll never get back.,4,8 September 2020,"Dear Disney,I already had Disney+ and you made us pay an extra 30 bucks on top of our subscription to watch this movie.Now, if you're gonna charge 30 bucks for people to watch a movie, the movie better be so good that I end up raving about it for years to come. But instead, you wasted my money, time, and left such a bitter taste in my mouth.There were the very, very few good things I can pick apart from this movie, but a grand majority of this movie is a cesspool.So here are the 'good' things about this movie-
-NO SONGS! No opportunity to BUTCHER the classic songs we love. THANK YOU!
-The actor for Mulan's dad was great. Probably the best actor of the entire thing.
-Cinematography looked good. Plenty of frame shots I would definitely make into a screensaver if I wanted to.
-Costume design was beautiful.And that's all the good I can really lay down.This movie tried to take itself so seriously, that it turned into a joke. And not a funny one at that. There were moments where I burst out in sudden laughter at how ridiculous some things were. Basically, for the people that don't know, this movie is not trying to replicate it's animated source. It's trying to adapt the original Chinese folk song/ballad about Mulan. So the original implication was that there would be no magic, no slapstick comedy, no musical moments. A serious and meaningful war movie. Did we the viewer get any of that in the one hour and 50 minutes we were watching this?Nope. The acting was flat, the plot was a mess, suspension of belief out the window in probably less than 30 minutes because they added a certain subplot last minute that tried to make sense but just confused me even more than I already was about the movie. The fight choreography was not all that impressive. Some of it laughable. And lastly, there's genuinely no heart to this movie. It's such a blatant cash grab, and I'm annoyed that yet another one of my favorite Disney classics got a live action reboot where they butchered everything.I'm actually making count now. So far, we've had live action reboots of Cinderella (decent), Jungle Book (fine), Beauty and The Beast (Awful), Aladdin (Awful), The Lion King (Atrocious), and now Mulan (Awful).Strap in your seats fellas. Next is live action Little Mermaid.Until then, all I can say to Disney and Bob Igher is, DISHONOR ON YOU, DISHONOR ON YOUR COW! Wasted my money for yet another piss poor live adaption. STOP with the live action remakes and make NEW original stories.Save your money people. Go watch the original Mulan on repeat with your kids. I know I surely needed to do so to recover from this waste of my time.4/10 stars. For a big budget movie, it deserves to be a Direct-to-video movie if I had to be honest.",Mulan
351,j-00900,Great Disney movie.,10,5 September 2020,"It is the best Disney live-action movie I have ever seen. Mulan is kind, brave and sincere. I see hope in her. I think everyone should go to see this movie. It is great.",Mulan
352,pattie7459,Ignore the negative reviews and give this a chance,7,7 March 2021,"I enjoyed this story about Mulan finding herself, but was confused about the phoenix. I can't remember the previous Disney versions so maybe that is good.

The acting was good. The action was good. It wasn't cringey. I never really liked the original anyways so I'm not biased. The costumes and set designs were good. But I was still bored. My feelings about this don't make any sense, so read other peoples reviews instead. My review doesn't really matter if you are trying to get a passionate feeling about the movie. But thanks for reading I guess.",Mulan
354,tony-clifton,"Okay, let me tell you what's wrong with this movie...",5,8 September 2020,"The original Disney Mulan movie was about a young inexperienced girl, and by sheer will, grit and courage, she learned how to be an exceptional soldier and leader to defeat a formidable enemy, along with the other soldiers she inspired.This new Mulan movie is none of that. It is about a girl with superpowers who beat up an inferior enemy because she had superpowers. Therefore this movie is a failure, because it fails to teach its most important lesson: any person, male or female, can succeed against all odds through team-work, bravery, good training and a will to succeed.I did find this movie entertaining, but felt sad that the writers and director just didn't get what Mulan was about.",Mulan

This is just sad! It's boring and the stupid crouching Tiger hidden dragon chi powers is so stupid. Honestly you can change the names and you couldn't even tell it wasn't just a generic Chinese movie. Then there were Times where it just felt rushed or poorly put together.",Mulan
356,jenkothetarheel,Ok,6,6 September 2020,"Let me start by saying it wasn't terrible as a movie. However as a remake it doesn't compare to the original at all. There were a few moments that I felt were cheesy. I hate when movies push narratives or include things in movies to be ""woke"" and make them feel forced instead of natural. It isn't as magical or rewatchable as the original. It was just decent for me. Maybe if you have no knowledge of the first one you will enjoy it more than I did.",Mulan
357,rg79912,Disappointed,5,23 December 2020,"I loved the original Mulan. Mulan was such a strong character with so much heart. This movie doesn't portray that Mulan. This Mulan tells us she has heart, but I struggle to see it. This Mulan has super martial arts skills because of magical powers, even as a child. Why?? Why do that to this character? It dampens the personal strength of Mulan's character if she doesn't have to work hard to be on par with and eventually better than the men she trains with. This movie seems to be wiping out the 'Women can be just as strong as men' vibe the first one had. It replaces it with a 'Women can only be as strong as men if they have super powers' vibe. It feels like this movie wants to take
equality backwards. All that aside, there were so many problems with this movie.
Jet Li who I have loved in the past was awful. His mouth wasn't speaking English, yet the words were voiced over by him in English, and it was just so bad. Why not just do it in English during filming? The voice over scenes were just ridiculous. Why is it so hard to get a good voice over that doesn't sound boisterous and over the top comical?
Also, why does Mulan have a sister? The sister is clearly favored in the family, and the whole point of her being an only child was to show the parents pain and fear of losing their only child. In this movie, they seem to have just moved on and gotten over Mulan because there is another child to focus on. Not cool Disney. Why is the sister praised when she ruined Mulan's time with the Matchmaker?
So much in this movie makes no sense. The fight scenes for example, are just not believable. All these warriors can defy gravity? Do they all possess this magical chi simply because they are male? If so, why aren't they putting up a better fight? Why is it so rare for a woman to possess chi and why is it such a danger when one does? It makes it seem as if a powerful woman has to be bad. Yet Mulan is not. I mean really Disney? This really makes it seem like there is something intrinsically wrong with Mulan.
Where is the adorable feisty Grandma? Maybe that character was not culturally appropriate, but a wise elderly Grandmother figure would've been nice nonetheless.
What is the deal with the Phoenix? OK, I get it, no cgi Mushu, but why couldn't it be a dragon? No one else could see it anyways but Mulan, so why the Phoenix. It just seems weirdly magical and designed to bring the point across that this story is make believe and couldn't possibly be real. Which is sad. It's like they're constantly taking back the positive message.
Why create this witch character?? Any woman who can fight like a man is a witch? Women can be strong and powerful, if and only if they have magical powers and/or magical protectors. What kind of message is that for girls? This movie is so backwards.
I also disliked the living situation in this film. I preferred the living situation of Mulan's family in the first. It was clear that the dad had done well for himself and had been a much respected warrior because of where they lived. In this film the dad is a shell of the original version. He is weak and a joke who is more likely to be ridiculed by others than esteemed. The reason being because of his wild daughter due to his pride and love for her? Mulan never has to overcome certain hardships in this film because she never was told her place, and was allowed to act like a boy. Except he does tell her finally, yet as narrator he tells us that he couldn't do that to her. So it seems like it wants to cheapen her accomplishments and give the dad credit, taking it away from Mulan. This entire film seems to not want to give Mulan any credit for her own heroic acts. That is so disappointing. This film wasn't entirely awful, but only because I really wanted to root for Mulan. This film just made no sense though.The best part was the one song at the end, Christina Aguilera killed it on the remake,and I never even liked her singing to begin with.",Mulan
358,prairiewalker,The negativity is way overdone,8,6 December 2020,"This is a good movie, worth your time. Particularly if you are now watching it for free on Disney+.",Mulan
359,eoswaldbigred,Exactly what I wanted,10,6 December 2020,"I do not understand the hate so many people on here have for this movie. You all seem to have wanted the animated movie completely reshot frame for frame with real people. That was NOT the point. And it would have been boring as hell. If you want the animated version (which I also love), then watch the animated version.This film is closer to the original story without talking dragons and other cutesy stuff. This was closer to the realities of the time. I loved the action sequences, Mulan having to hide herself at the training camp. And the fact that she didn't NEED a man to be complete, which is the story of almost every fairy tale and Disney movie.This was about a strong woman standing up for her family and saving her father's life, not just the emperor.Beautifully shot in scenic locations and more reminiscent of the time from which the story came, this is a perfect retelling of a strong character and the choices she makes for country and for family.",Mulan
360,jamesl2061-683-328126,Mulan - Should be rated PG: Not suitable for political gain,7,9 September 2020,"A remake of a tale about an inspirational hero who exemplifies values and virtues and who overcomes not just evil villains but also both class and stereotypical obstacles should do well.Add to that a cast that reads like a who's who of accomplished Chinese actors, breathtaking scenery and the magic arts of hollywood spread evenly on a screenplay that provides a good balance of drama, humour and action and it starts to shout ""Slam Dunk"".As a movie, Mulan is far from perfect. The acting is middling, the dialog cliched and syrupy and the CG passable, a decade ago. But the themes are strong, the storyline while predictable is coherent and overall it does what cinema and Disney do best, it entertains.Yes, it is based in a country that's currently on the nose, the values contradict reality and some cast members have personal views that grate but as a movie Mulan in no way deserves 1 and 2 stars.The same storyline set in any other culture would easily garner more favour. At a time when a few minutes of detachment and escapism is sorely needed, Mulan delivers, but only to those able to suspend the white noise for the 2 hours.Go see for yourself, if not for you then for the children.",Mulan

364,fmbr-1,Very Disappointing,3,20 January 2021,"Even if I don't compare this to the original Disney Mulan, this would still be a disappointment. My biggest problem is that Mulan, the Emperor and most of the antagonists seem to have poorly explained super powers (referred to as Chi for the film) which are poorly explained or defined. This takes all the stakes out of the movie as whenever she is in trouble, Mulan can just pull out some awesome feat out and save herself. A good example of this is the sorceress throws a shuriken at Mulan which throws her twenty feet through the air and knocks her out against a rock, but doesn't penetrate the wrapping around her breasts?This also leads to the other characters not really mattering much to the film except that Mulan likes them and is trying, at least for most of the film, to keep her secret.One positive note is the cinematography. The scenery and even shots they get are pretty impressive to look at.Finally, there are just so many plot holes in this film to take seriously. Why does Mulan just throw away her armour? Why does the avalanche just bury the enemies? Why does the bird sorceress feel beholden to the enemy, she is clearly more powerful than him? Why doesn't Bori Khan attack a lot earlier, he easily could? This whole film wreaks of 'style over substance', something I've never liked.",Mulan
365,sinahaase-960-743497,I gave it a 10 because it is NOT a 4.5 but not that great honestly,10,4 September 2020,"Just trying to be nice because I feel bad seeing the score at a 4.5! It is NOT that bad people, come on. This movie was meant for the big screen because it just doesn't do justice at home. The acting is pretty embarrassing except for the witch. I think they did a great job having Mulan showing some potential as a ""skilled fighter"" as a young age because it's way more believable than just having some short training and all of a sudden becoming the best warrior of all. But there are things I do agree with, with other reviews. But to be fair it is NOT a 4.5...even though I gave a 10 to be nicer than others I'd say my honest review of Mulan is a 6.9 or 7. I do not think it's worth $30 unless you have a big projector and a few friends over to watch with. Otherwise, watch it later :) (but I understand the urge to watch it just out of ones own curiosity)",Mulan

It's such a disappointment for this firm that made our youth so happy and colorful. They got rid off their best artist, best workers, etc just to please their shareholders and completely abandon their loyal viewers... They fix almost all their resources on fraudulent marketing now, because manipulation works.
Their last movies are just....bad, lazy and deceitful. Mulan follows this rule, trying to milk the cash cow again releasing a movie totally different from the original, but kept the title just to fill cinemas.

373,Glue2Screen,"Messy plot, dull characters & did not capture the original",5,13 September 2020,"Let's start with the pros: the set design and art team did well to capture the feel from the original.Now that we got that out of the way, let's jump into what a mess that movie was.1) PLOT HOLES: When the witch possessed the soldier and approached the emperor, she could have just killed the emperor and taken power. No war needed, the witch can have her throne and Khan can just reign along side. You might argue that Khan wanted to kill emperor himself but the witch could just magically take Khan inside the palace. What's the point of the war?
2) The Witch: What was the point of this character? To drive home the point of feminism? To create a female antagonist? If these were the aim of the witch character, sadly it failed. Her dialogue were so pointless that I wasn't even listening when she was talking. How she had that epiphany after one chat with Mulan and then sacrificed herself to save her was so baffling and rushed. Character development doesn't happen after one discussion, they aren't light switches.
3) Chi: Mulan in the original cartoon trained hard after everyone went to bed. She worked at her fighting and combat skills. That was inspirational, it made Mulan a role model who worked hard and did not use her looks to get by. This live action got rid of this aspect completely. Instead it gave her and the witch 'chi' without a faint explanation why or how this chi came about. What is the deal with this??? I'm all for magical worlds but present this to viewers with well thought out backstory. Don't throw magic in just for the sake of it.
4) The phoenix: if we removed the phoenix from the movie would it have made a difference to the overall outcome?
5) Travel: Is it Mulan's chi to travel fast and become invisible? If it was then that would explain how she got past a large army of enemies without being seen and shoot at them from behind. As well how she can travel through the entire city to protect the emperor
6) Dialogue: many times the characters seem to tell us what is happening instead of just letting the audience figure things out. Example: when the witch first appeared to Mulan, she says ""Oh it's a witch."" Writers seem to not understand the point of dialogue.
7) Armor: Inconsistency with the armors, it seemed like arrows pierces the armors with no issues (horse back chase scene). Mulan's armor seemed useless against the witch's mini dagger but her fabric wrap around her chest saved her. Ummmmmm even if you argue she uses bamboo or other material to wrap her chest, would it still stronger than the metal armor?Had so much hope for this movie as I loved the animation original. This live action tried but sadly did not meet expectation.",Mulan
374,srdikano,"Beautiful photography, meh film",5,21 September 2020,"I was excited about this one. Unlike others, I did not watch the original animated film and I was not acquainted with the story, so I was looking forward to just enjoying the film. Alas...The photography is beautiful, there are some visually arresting moments and some of the performances are quite decent. Sadly, that's as far as the positives go. The story is clumsily conveyed, characters aren't sufficiently developed to feel invested in them and the script is remarkably tacky, even painful at times.Is this movie terrible as some have made it out to be? Absolutely not. I think people are - perhaps rightly - disappointed because expectations were high for a story that means much to many and those expectations were fundamentally not delivered on.

The movie is visually stunning along with the beautifully designed production representing the Chinese culture. It has an All-Star cast of Asian/Asian-American actors and actresses.
However, much of this movie could have been figured out by watching this trailer. This movie is missing one of its biggest characters that made the original movie, Mushu!

383,LansTaylor,Not worth the price of admission,4,7 September 2020,"I knew going into this that nothing would ever compare to the original cartoon musical, but this was just plain B-A-D; bad. It felt like I was watching an early 2000s' Chinese martial arts drama but without the story.
I'm going to compare this version to the original a lot but bare with me. In the original, Mulan take her fathers place to go to war in order to save him and show that she is stronger and more determined than any man; but in the live action, she has....powers? This totally cheapens the story and contradicts the fact that they got rid of Mushu to make the story more ""realistic"". Also, there's a witch with the power to turn into a bird and a human but she chooses to be a side kick to Khan. Just why? In the original, Mulan cuts her hair and drops her voice real low to make her seem like a man. In this one, she just ties up her hair and drops her voice like 1 octave. She looks AND sounds exactly like a woman!
No disrespect but the actress was so mis-casted. She showed virtually no emotion and sounds like she was reading off of a cue card.
Honestly if the witch wasn't in the movie, I don't think anything would've changed. She really didn't bring much to the table and sacrificed herself for no reason.
All in all, this movie was a huge let down and is by far the worst of the Disney remakes. If they did a Lion's King shot for shot, it would've made this 100 times more enjoyable.",Mulan

386,gregmalone1,'Perfection' is relative -- I enjoyed the film despite 'issues',9,9 September 2020,"I never saw the animated film, so I don't hold the new live action film responsible to live up to any previous standard. That makes me, in my view, a more neutral arbiter of Mulan 2020 as a film consumer.I've read the criticisms of this film, ranging from Chinese national political involvement (listed in the film credits), alleged manipulation of the story's themes to favor the official China government propaganda about the nation, location shoots near the Uighur detention camps, the film's lead actor Liu Yifei speaking in support of China's clampdown on the Hong Kong democracy movement, and criticisms of the creative choices made in the film. While each of these items carries some weight in some perspectives, I didn't let them influence me while I watched the end-product, the film.As a standalone film, given the caveats stated above, Mulan 2020 is solid entertainment, beautifully crafted, with a positive message for the world and young people. The storyline is noble, the central character is a stoic role model, and the possible creative choice disputes can easily be overlooked by a neutral observer.Did I find the Witch problematic, design-wise, as some point out? No, not really, but I can see how she could've been expanded upon further. Except, a filmmaker has to make choices, else the movie runs on for hours.Did I find the Phoenix confusing? Perhaps. I was confused about it at first, thinking it was the Witch, but then, after a while it became more clear -- or, as clear as it was going to get. This element could've been better explained or elaborated or put in some kind of context.Was I pleased with all the casting choices and the dialogs? Mostly, but again why do we need to second guess the process of putting this film together?As to the politics that have been injected into the discussions about Mulan 2020, I'd simply point out that all film locations have some troubled history or ongoing issues, worldwide.Any films shot in the American South and parts of the East Coast are done so on land that once harbored institutionalized slavery sanctioned by the U.S. Constitution. Where's the outrage for that?Should Driving Miss Daisey have been banned or boycotted? Extending beyond entertainment, should the Judeo-Christian Bible be banned due to it's advocation of violence against our 'enemies'?I know these are not a perfect examples, but one must try to have the larger view of the world at times, and for me general entertainment should be largely exempt from some of the justified angst in society, unless (the caveat) the entertainment is blatantly a propaganda tool spreading dangerous falsehoods as truths that seek to stir up greater division and harm. Mulan 2020 does not do any of that as an entertainment product, despite any behind-the-scenes facts or nuances.My first thought as the movie ended was that I would want to watch it again some day in order to absorb more of the creative detail I might've missed. I liked it that much.Kindly spare me any angry rants and entrenched arguments. These are all just my own opinions which I believe are fair minded.",Mulan

Mulan herself doesn't have much in the way of character growth - at some point half way through we're told by a narrator that she's found herself and basically that's it.The final act fell apart for me.

398,sebastianschlicht,A Disney-Disaster!,1,6 February 2021,"The original ""Mulan"" from 1998 is one of many unique Disney-films. Based on a chinese poem, Disney created an exciting story about a woman who bravely stood up against early gender oppression by pretending to be a man in order to save her father from war. At that time, Disney was still in a good and respectable position. I personally didn't grow up with Mulan and don´t have a deep connection with it, but I really appreciate the movie. What I don't appreciate are the soulless remakes by the same company. After the remake of ""Beauty and the Beast"" I couldn´t stand these ""Live-Action""-things anymore. And, sadly, the focus is still clearly on these remakes. Several other projects are planned... In 2020, however, the major release of the ""Mulan"" remake was published on Disney + due to the corona pandemic. Sounds like a fair and practical solution for users of the streaming service, but when the film was released on September 4th, you could only see it with a so called ""VIP ticket"". For the price of an overpriced movie ticket, you could watch the film. In theory, this is perhaps understandable and justified (after all, you could watch the film with several people for the price of ONE ticket), but it still shows how greedy the company is, even now. In December, Pixar's ""Soul"" was released without the VIP ticket, so apparently, they learned from it. The question is, however, whether this will be done again with later films ... But let's get to ""Mulan"" from 2020. I actually thought that ""Aladdin"" (2019) would have been the worst adaptation so far (I still refuse to watch ""The Lion King"" from 2019!), but I believe ""Mulan"" will take the cake as the worst Disney-remake.The young girl Mulan has the chi. That means she is fast, strong, can do all sorts of fighting techniques and is almost invincible. But her family wants her to hide these skills, because, as a woman, she must of course be able to get married and make tea for her future husband. However, when a war approaches, Mulan's old father is recruited. But with his broken leg he will probably not survive, which is why Mulan secretly steals his armor and takes up the fight with the Rourans (not the Huns, as in the original) for him and her family ...Where do I even start? ""Mulan"" (2020) is one of those films that is not just bad, but in a way insultingly bad, at least for me. And I have relatively little emotional connection to the original. But almost EVERY decision in the film is completely wrong or just stupid.
First of all, the obvious: The film lacks any feelings and soul. And it´s not hard to point out why. For example, when Mulan puts on her father's armor there is a lack of structure and emotional representation. In the animated original, this is one of the best scenes in the movie as the music and animation are showing every step of Mulan's transformation from a woman to a warrior. She cuts off her hair and ties off her breasts. And how is it portrayed here? One cut and she stands there in full gear with her back to us. She turns around, looks bored (I'll get to the main actress later!) and that's it. Wow! The film is full of these empty moments. While the original created emotional scenes that built on each other and strongly supported the story, the remake doesn't even try to copy those moments. In theory, all the important parts in the story are there, but both the script and the characters appear lifeless and anything but natural. All the main characters could have died horribly, and I wouldn't have cared.The remake was widely marketed for not incorporating any songs or great, silly fantasy elements like the dragon Mushu. Yep, that's all missing. It's not that bad, because I'm always in favor of Disney trying something different and not copying the original 1 to 1. Unfortunately, director Niki Caro seemed to take away exactly the things that gave the original soul and charm. Instead, we now have the ""chi"" that makes you super powerful. In this movie Mulan has been a powerful warrior from the start who has to hide her talents. So, her decision to go to war no longer looks like a big, brave act. In the original, however, Mulan is NOT a warrior, but a charming hothead who struggles with the traditions of her culture. A young woman who has more courage than brains, but that is exactly what makes her so likeable. First she has to learn how to fight, which is shown excellent in the later training montage of the film. This is called ""character development"", something that is essential to 90% of all films and stories in the world. The only development Mulan makes in the 2020 remake is the decision to use her powers. And in the most stupid way: In the middle of the battle, she takes off her armor and presents her long, magnificent hair (since she's still a ""strong"" woman, she didn't have to cut it off ...) and rides into the fray. So stupid!What else do we got? The villain Böri Khan (in the original it was Shan Yu, as the leader of the Huns) also has an eagle, but the bird is now a witch who also has the chi. And I strongly believed that Mulan had to fight the witch in the end, but no: The oh-so bad witch turns out to be good and takes Mulan's side, because they both have the chi and of course because both are women. At least that's how it works from the point of view of the film, because the toxic feminism that Disney has been promoting in its films in recent years can also be admired here in all its disgusting glory. Disney just doesn't seem to understand what a ""strong woman"" is. The fact that she is a woman is enough. And so, we get a female main character that has no relatable problems and thus comes across as unspeakably boring and trivial. Her love affair with the commanding officer from the original has also been changed here because Mulan cannot be given any orders in her relationship... She has feelings for one of her companions here. In my opinion, this is a decision that is probably the least terrible one, but still somehow seems unnecessary and pointless.Let's get to the cast: Leading actress Liu Yifei plays Mulan and unfortunately cannot breathe any life into her character. She plays her part with no emotion and looks as if she wanted to look pretty all the time... The rest of the cast also seems listless, which is perhaps also due to the terribly lifeless script. All the dialogue is pure cliché, and nobody really talks real. It is the well-known ""movie language"" that is driving me crazy, especially when it´s presented in such a boring way.The music by Harry Gregson-Williams unfortunately couldn´t stand out and wasn´t even particularly noticeable in the film. But above all, it's the look of the movie that bothered me. Like ""Aladdin"", ""Mulan"" looks more like a clean Broadway musical (only this time without the musical ...). The action scenes, on the other hand, look like a cheaply recreated anime. The remake was supposed to come across as darker and more ""real"", but almost every action scene inevitably made me laugh. Everything looks so ridiculous and fake. Especially the finale has a lot of trash-vibes. Mulan kicks spears and swords through the air like Neo in ""The Matrix"". I'm sorry, but the original is so much more adult and also ""darker"", despite the colorful animations and songs.Last but not least, the editing by David Coulson: The early mentioned action scenes also seem so bad and confusing because several frantic cuts are made within a few seconds. You can't see any of the fight-choreography that well or the scope of the battles.Conclusion: ""Mulan"" from 2020 is without a doubt one of the worst films from the pandemic-year and, in my opinion, also one of the worst Disney films ever. There is just nothing right here. The film has no soul and every change suffers mainly from misplaced, toxic feminism. Disney has a huge problem with these remakes. They bring in the big bucks, but the artistic quality is slowly fading away with every new movie. These ""products"" are soulless, over-produced CGI monsters and (most of the time) have nothing to do with their source material. And ""Mulan"" (2020) is a sad prime example of this!",Mulan

404,tuanskie,Plain Silly with Stinky Extra Cheese,1,9 September 2020,"It's Disney cheese with an extra pound of stink sprinkled on top. Here's the low-down:1. Donnie Yen was great as always. He's clearly THE martial artist and his acting was good too. Side by side, no one matches with him. His martial arts should not have been that stellar, when the heroine was supposed to be Mulan.
2. Mulan apparently was gifted with extraordinary fighting prowess without being taught anything as a child. A cliche that would have worked is if she was actually taught how to fight...by Donnie Yen maybe? Shoulder shrug to this blunder.
3. Was Jet Li in this movie? Great makeup work.
4. Mulan's village was a bad rip off from Kung Fu Hustle. Disney cheese was added to make the village clean and spotless. In fact, it was clean and spotless in every location of the movie, even extending to the wardrobe and objects. The dad's sword, which was used in prior battle, was spotless and unblemished.
5. Mulan's character could have been so much better developed. With good directing, she would have been much more endearing and charismatic. You don't randomly make her hair curled when she is fighting baddies. The actress did a good job for what it's worth - it's the directing that made her character plain silly and unbelievable.
6. I get it - Mulan is a woman in a male-dominated society. At the end, all the males bow down to her and all of Chinese civilization owes their gratitude. What I don't get is why this has to be in-your-face so obvious?
7. The CGI characters and fighting scenes stunk up the movie. It was also very stylized a la Hero, but the latter actually had stellar fighting choreography (Jet and Donnie obviously) and a coherent story line that was enriched by actual Chinese language, not English.If you want to waste $30 for streaming, have right at it and entertain the little kids. Otherwise, fire up Hero or Crouching, Tiger Hidden Dragon to see what real female empowerment (Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi) can accomplish in good movie productions.",Mulan

Are you ready for a thoughtless rehashing of a beloved Disney classic with real people instead of animation? You'll have to look elsewhere. This Mulan has a mind of its own, and if you're willing to set aside your expectations, you're in for a treat. If you're hoping for hilarious side characters who spontaneously break out in song, you will land among the throngs of disappointed reviewers bemoaning how heartless this Mulan is.Disney obviously invested an immense amount of time and effort keeping the cast ethnically accurate, the sets true to life, yet bright and vibrant, and the values simultaneously Disney and Asian. Family, honor, honesty, loyalty-it's all here in spades with a down-to-earth set of leads who are believably committed both to their cause and to one another.The fight scenes are fittingly epic. The scenery and cinematography are gorgeous, and the cast is lovable, if somewhat muted by a lack of dialogue and interaction. The character development is there, but not as rich as I would have liked, with characters like Po exhibiting a potential the writing never allows them to live up to. But, overall, Mulan is the girl we deserve in this well-done remake, exhibiting both stunning strength and courage while also shining through as an every-girl who isn't a supermodel-cum-Disney-princess. She's lovely, yes, but so REAL and relatable, with plenty of non-makeup moments to accentuate her individuality.And lest you be wary of a modern trend of denigrating traditional feminine roles, the movie adequately allows room for both, not despising girls who are homemakers, but showing that both roles can bring honor to the family.I was moved.

Usually I consider a rating of 6 something that is arguably tolerable or feel-good, and a 7 is a decent quality movie that is easy to enjoy but not quite trying to be a masterpiece. This movie was right on the mark for 7, but some might consider it a 6 using my standards because it doesn't resemble the original in many ways and sometimes pushes a feminist agenda that might annoy some (I thought it was subtle enough to not feel forced or stupid). I'd definitely recommend this to anyone interested in watching it as it is far better than the live action Aladdin but not quite as good as the live action Cinderella.

There are many wonderful stories in historical stories, but there is such a story about women's power that Hua Mulan in China has really been the only one that has made a great contribution.

We have seen that many times before. Mulan is eye candy, drama and action. I see hints of Crouching Tiger, I see hints of Pocahontas. As many Disney movies before the violence is restricted, same with nudity. This is more a family (not for the youngest) movie than a bloodfilled action. It is more drama than romantic cuteness. It still really is an action/drama - but softed as most Disney movies are.I loved the photography and really liked the actors. Some reviews called the Mulan movie soulless but I have to disagree.

425,pk1233,Mediocre Disney Action Movie,6,26 December 2020,"Look, don't go in expecting a shot for shot remake of the cartoon. Honestly, why would you even want that? This film takes the basic storyline of Mulan (the original tale, not the old movie) and turns it into an action film. As a big action movie buff, this movie fell flat for me. The action was nothing special when compared to many action movies. However, it's a still a decent story with good acting and a solid plot. Worth watching at least once.",Mulan
426,Sophie_KN_66615,If 2020 were a remake....,1,1 January 2021,"I really wanted to like this and for me personally, this had the premise of being the best Disney movie I'd ever watched.
As a female of Asian descent myself, I think the scenes with the community and the relationship between Mulan and her father were handled beautifully. And the fact that there were no annoying songs was a bonus. It had so much potential.
Where did it go wrong then? In short, it's political agenda.
This remake was filmed partly in Xinjiang amid mass human rights abuses. I could go into details of how factually incorrect the villains are, not to mention the Eastern looking, black clad 'bad guys' who happen to share a surname with the tortured Uighurs (please educate yourselves and read up on the ethnic genocide that's occured there). But I'll let you research that and instead just quickly reference that two of the film's stars, Liu Yifei (Mulan) and Donnie Yen (Commander Tung), have voiced their support of the Hong Kong police against the city's pro-democracy protests, thus sparking an online movement to boycott the film.
All this aside, ignoring the heavy political agenda, the action scenes were so lacklustre and not at all what one would expect from a film in this genre.
In summary, this movie failed everyone.
If you were looking for happy Disney singalong movie, sorryLooking for a factually correct historical movie? Nope, not itPerhaps you were after a Chinese martial arts movie reminiscent of Jet Lis 'Prodigal Son' days? Sorry, you'll also be disappointed.Just had all around",Mulan
427,sang-77830,Poor Execution,4,5 September 2020,"This movie is not for kids.Cons:
1. There is a lack of dialogue and conversations.
2. There is a lack of Character Development.Because of this, you just don't care about the characters.
They need to build the characters personalities more.
It is like one of those War Movies, where all you see is Action and No Talking.
This hurts the movie a lot.3. Some of the fighting is very lacking.
They have so many famous martial artist actors in the movie.
They should have used them to enhance the movie.
Add more Action. Add more Fighting Choreography.
Some of the fighting was way too Simplistic.Pros:
The Cinematography was pretty good.
They really capture the environment and scenery, better than many movies.",Mulan

This movie is just simply NOT Disney's Mulan. People who expected a live action remake of Mulan got something entirely different.

Doesn't matter who or what you put in it, it wouldn't hold up. So I was hopeful but sceptical. It's a pretty movie to look at, the filmmakers improved on that score. Costumes, sets and scenery etc, but the character development was woeful. Had you not seen the 1998 version you would struggle to understand much of the underlying premise of the story or the character(s). Struggles. The filmmakers instead introduced something akin to super-powers to highlight Mulan's determination rather than the self-belief and belonging as per the original. The screenplay was weak but the actors did a very good job with what they had. Putting it all together, it was an OK movie. Not bad, but not great and nowhere near as good as the original.",Mulan

436,Bigideas_Baggins,How to disempower women,1,26 October 2020,"Being a man myself, I am just so curious how a movie like this is empowering to women. It's not like we never had strong women characters in the past - Ellen Ripley, Sarah Connor, Kira Nerys, Leia Organa, or even 1998 Mulan. Back then they did not start out as superheroes from the start - no, they actually succeed due to inginuity, perserverance, determination, toughness, intelligence. Doesn't that feel empowering? Sure does to me... But nowadays, ""strong"" women just have some magical power, like the force. Apparently ""the force"" translated in Chinese is qi. You are just born with it, you don't have to learn it, train for it, or whatever. In the case of Mulan, you just have to accept to use it!So, then, what if you are a woman that was born without special powers? I guess you are out of luck - no empowerment for you. Maybe the idea is that all women are born with a special power. Now sure, I think each individual person is born in her or his own special way, but that is not the same.Now don't get me wrong, I am all for equal treatment of women and men (or races for that matter). I just do not understand how these kinds of portrayals are a good way to achieve it.",Mulan

A majestic fresco, with a color treatment that highlights each & every shot. Yes, the photography is really striking and can't leave you insensible. Also, the music inhabitates every chapter with an immense grace, and accompanies this emotional journey alongside Mulan in the most grandiose way !The screenplay keeps the same main beats as the original animated version, but upgrades the storyline as a whole, with more subtlety and depth ... Yifei Liu has a magnetic presence and transmits us a lot of emotions through her so expressive eyes ...Of course, the choregraphies and the staging also have a very finely crafted artistic language, which flows like a smooth dance, throughout the movie ... Obviously there are some iconic scenes and images that nicely punctuate the adventure and participate to make it evolve into an ever more epic & emotional way.Mulan's interactions with each character, are a big strenght of the movie, they all are a step and a deciding element in her evolution as a woman & hero, from the very first scene up until the very last scene.A beautiful movie, on many levels.",Mulan
439,TheOtherMovieGuy,The mature version of Mulan - and it's good,8,11 September 2020,"I loved the 1998 animated version so I was a little worried how this would measure up and wasn't sure what to expect because so often I find that live-action remakes falls short of their animated counterparts. Well, my worries were unfounded because apart from sharing the the general storyboard, this version does not try to be another remake. I can almost visualize the producers in 1997 asking themselves ""should we make this a kids movie or a movie for a mature audience?"" and then flipping a coin. Well, we know that the animated version won that coin-flip but had the coin landed the other way, this is how that mature film would have been made. I think this film is as good as the 1998 version - different, but as good. In fact, trying to comparing the two films is like trying to compare milkshake with beer - sure both are beverages and quench thirst but they're fundamentally different. This version targets a more grown-up audience and the plot has matured. However, that, I believe, is also the root cause of many of the negative reviews you see here - misplaced expectations. Some reviewers confuse that with the quality of the movie - read some of the negative reviews and you'll see what I mean. As I said, this is no longer a movie for small kids, it is mature film that targets a grown-up audience. The plot is well scripted and the fighting scenes are exciting; relatively realistic and not the full-blown martial arts fighting as you'd see in some kung-fu movies. The story is quite engaging and I think it connects more emotionally with the viewer than the animated film which is mostly cute and funny. The plot pretty much remains unchanged: Mulan, who is a bit of a tomboy, tries to protect her father from being drafted to the army so she takes his place disguised as a man and through that experience discovers herself. The values of honesty, loyalty and family permeates Hua Mulan's actions and I found that quite a refreshing change from the usual action / hero / romance films that floods the market. Another thing I loved about the film was the way they captured the scenes; landscapes, architecture and sweeping scenery are amazingly well filmed and I wish my screen was bigger so I could truly immerse myself in the images. Stunning cinematography. Maybe it's the Covid fears but Disney should have been released this film in the cinemas because the televisions at home struggle to do the movie justice. And to wrap this review up - This is in my opinion the best film I have seen from Disney in a long time and It's absolutely worth watching. Don't make the mistake to think that this is the live-action version of the animated film. This is the mature version with a heart....and thank God, without need for comic relief.",Mulan

I can't put my finger on exactly why, but I felt like I was watching a summary of a movie more than an actual movie. It felt like it just didn't go deep enough. And when the end climactic action came, I felt like, ""This is the big ending? But we haven't built up to it enough."" The thing is, it's not too short. I was even bored on occasion. It's just lacking in something. It's still worth a watch, because you might disagree and I do appreciate female-driven action movies and the lead actress did a good job.",Mulan

And there was little-to-no emotion or buildup of suspense for those moments. The liberties taken by the writers to differentiate from the animated counterpart of the past were too far different to satisfy the nostalgia, and if they're woke about Chinese history and culture, well removing mushu and the music did not get them any closer to an authentic Chinese experience.

455,Dark-Wolverine,A great potential wasted,6,5 September 2020,"Well, Disney does it again! I was pretty excited for this and yes, it's a dissapointment, especially who love the original Mulan.Here's what I actually like about the movie: This movie is visually spectacular, there were many great visuals during the fighting scenes and all. The pacing was fine. The action sequences were neat yet sometimes hard to watch due to the high frame rate. I also like the effort they put to ""try"" and make it look different from the animated version by adding new substances and deleting every comedic aspect of the original.Here's what I didn't like: The characterisation in this movie was terrible. Mulan had little to no character development in the movie and again they didn't give the villains much more personality. The acting was stiff, you couldn't feel any emotions from them sadly and, I actually didn't feel anything while watching it. They tried to make it look serious but, it ended up discarding everything that made the original soo good and replaced it with nothing. The cgi looked messy at places too.In conclusion, Mulan(2020) is a disappointment. It was a colourful and action packed ride with nothing memorable and they tried to show more of the Chinese culture than the other. I won't prefer this for a rewatch and those who are fans of Mulan or a general movie goer, try it out, Maybe you'll like it more than I did.Is this the worst Disney remake? No",Mulan

This movie doesn't have ANY singing at all. It also does not include Mushu, so that means basically no humor.

Its now mostly serious but not even close to ""cool"" serious. Guess they were going for the wireframe crouching dragon thing but it looked and felt like a bad bollywood film.Then take out every quality of the main character that made her likeable and make her a perfect paragon of all things good (boring)... oh and give her super powers? I guess girls wanted a character that they cant relate to at all and can never amount to. Hope you are born with mass amounts of chi ladies, or you'll be a normie like Mulan's sister who was married off anyway. Mulan begins and ends the story in the same condition. She had no growth, didn't earn or learn anything and had almost no failures to speak of. The only thing she learned was how to not be held down by the patriarchy *woke trumpets sounding in the distance*. She needed to let her hair down and throw off her armor and kick all the men's butts. Sigh...Its strange that they took away many of the ""magical"" elements of the original like the talking spirit ancestors and Mushu, but then decided to add a new magical sorceress character?? Who mind you, does nothing for the story at all....except provide another boss queen *yaassssss*. Tired of this new Hollywood/Disney trend, especially at the expense of nostalgic beloved characters and films. If you named this anything else other than Mulan it would have done even worse in box office sales.... the only reason it did even remotely well was the Disney name attached to it and bait and switch of the animated classic.

The acting is sometimes very stiff but hey; they get the job done. And this 'they get the job done' goes for the whole movie. Everything from the cgi to the ost is just decent, not amazing, not bad, just ok.

485,thedongwu,"Not trash, but low on the to-watch list",4,29 December 2020,"This is the weakest live-action remake of the Disney animated films that I have seen, although it does have strengths. First among these is the visuals; this is a beautiful film with stunning landscapes, thrilling action sequences, and vibrant costuming. The cast is good as well; Liu Yifei does a solid job but is not as compelling as I'd hoped. Culturally, this movie does a better job than the animated original to be both genuine and respectful, but at other times it slips back into a cringe-inducing US orientalist gaze.The pacing also felt off in this film, with strangely dissonant cuts between certain scenes. At times, it felt like the movie was not cohesive. The fantasy, in fact the entire addition of the witch, was half-hearted and not well integrated into the story. The movie seemed to be trying to do too many things at once, and achieve too much at once. While Gong Li's witch character was important thematically, the movie did not devote enough attention to her and as a result her presence lacked the emotional satisfaction or investment to really be worthwhile. Similarly, Mulan and Honghui's connection felt a little unearned.Overall, the visuals are not enough (in my opinion) to make this a priority watch. Probably leave it near the bottom of your watch-list and prioritise other films first.",Mulan

488,eejohnston-56374,It's not supposed to be the animated movie!,9,4 September 2020,"Though there will invariably be those who complain that this isn't a shot-by-shot remake of the 90's version, I absolutely loved Disney's live action Mulan! Having been to Western China and New Zealand where the stunning landscapes were filmed, I'm admittedly disappointed that I didn't get to see Niki Caro's vision on IMAX (first world problem of the month). Unlike in the animated classic, every role in this version is played by an actor of Asian with Yifei Liu being cast perfectly in the role of Mulan (it would have been awesome if Ming-Na Wen would have been cast as Mulan's mother). Mandy Walker's cinematography during the fight sequences utilizes a few Crouching Tiger, Flying Princess (yes, I did say PRINCESS haters...so don't at me) elements in the use of red in the costuming is stunning. The score ties the film back to the original with Christina Aguilera returns two decades later to update ""Reflections"" as well as belting out ""Loyal, Brave & True"" (I will be shocked if the latter isn't nominated for an Oscar). While it did feel like it lagged in a few scenes, the message it sent is still resoundingly class. Just like its animated predecessor, Mulan provides yet another example of a strong female Disney character for young girls to show them that they don't need to sit around waiting to be rescued by a prince...indeed, it shows that while women are too easily dismissed as weak...when given the opportunity, they can rise to be strong leaders for others to follow and save a nation...a message that children and adults should hear. Those whining about not being animated classic are idiots...the real original story goes back more than 1500 years and didn't involve a magical dragon...and yet, no one whined en masse about Disney ruining the Chinese ballad. Regardless, there's room in my Mulan loving heart for both versions of this movie!",Mulan

I expected some lower reviews simply just for the actress who played Mulan (who was brilliant by the way), but I've come across more reviews that just show people's arrogance peeping through, bashing the movie because it's 'not how they remember it' or 'want it to be'.
Remember, this story is a Chinese story and the movie follows Chinese themes and traditions like upholding family honour. The movie keeps it's empowering story, whilst being more serious than the animated version, it keeps the heart of the original; not to mention the beautiful cinematography.Most of these reviews are blabbering on about characters like Mushu the dragon, or the missing musical numbers.

Great casting.

It's more of a Chinese cultural and trditional version of classic mulan , dark, seriously made action movie .Niki Caro managed to focus on those minor mistakes were made in mulan(1998) but made several major mistakes in her adoption. She made it more reasonable like Bori Khan's past and why strong women hide their existence.It's good to see an action-packed dark adoption of an epic classic but except great locations and epic sets it's nothing like a Disney movie .If you loved the animated Mulan then I'll suggest to please stay away from this one or if you want to then don't expect the same mulan .

495,moritzmeyerautor,"An epic, rousing and feminist action movie that should have gone to the cinemas",9,26 September 2020,"A movie night with her besties was what our daughter wanted for her 10th birthday. So we turned on the new Mulan, the perfect film for a group of girls between 10 and 13 years old.
I get that the reception of Mulan has been controversial. But don't listen to the misogynistic troll community of the internet that tries to mansplain, why ""this is not Mulan"", because it doesn't have an annoying talking dragon as comic relief. What needs to be taken more seriously, though, is the criticism of people directly from China or with cultural reference to the country. Despite all efforts, Disney apparently got a couple of things wrong. The inclusion of a phoenix as a religious symbol is among them. Accepted. Nowadays, it has become increasingly difficult to make a film that suits everyone. We need to be conscious of the misdepiction of non-western cultures and learn how to make it better. But Mulan gets many things right anyway.
First of all, Yifei Liu's Mulan is a great heroine with whom the young viewers could identify immediately. The new figure of the ""witch"" also worked well as a fascinating and ambivalent antagonist. Director Niki Caro uses the rather allegorical visual language of martial arts cinema to good effect. Naturalistic set pieces and landscape shots support her style of storytelling in a very good way (we know that she can do this since Whale Rider). Overall, this is an entirely new version of the Mulan story rather than a bland re-telling.
Personally, I think this is a better way to approach these remakes. The almost shot-by-shot remake of The Lion King, despite being tremendously successful, didn't work for me at all. This version of Mulan stands much more on its own feet. It's an epic, rousing and feminist action movie that should have gone to the cinemas, where it belongs. But it's worth watching at home, too.",Mulan
496,mauimicloudcom,No Extremely Dangerous Haircut,2,19 February 2021,I just watch the movie. Old version she herself a extremely dangerous haircut. 2020 version then skip the screen. Many show most her in boot camp.,Mulan
497,angelkitteh-32778,Mulan does not have to be a Disney animation replica and it works just fine.,6,10 September 2020,"First of all, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Although it does have its high and lows.Mulan is a historical figure. The stories can be told as seen fit instead of having to follow the footsteps of the Disney animation. I actually prefer this version of Mulan without all the unnecessary humor from the dragon sidekick, the cricket (as an insect) and the romance scenes.That being said. I wished they had followed through with the realism and hence here are aspects of the movie which could have been improved.#1 Fancy VFX that was not necessary and only added to the cringe factor. While the battle actions were great and one that remotely resembles 'wu sha' films, the witch and the phoenix with its plastic/kite looking tail was completely not necessary and did not add much to the plot. Instead they could focus more on Mulan's growth and the battle scenes (which by the way lack any tactics whatsoever)#2 Westernization of the dialogues. Although I understand that targeting the western audience makes bigger bucks in most of the cases, it hindered the overall experience of the movie. The three pillar of virtue for example could have been described in much more in depth if the movie was spoken in Mandarin instead of English. It just made the whole movie seem that bit shallower.All in all, decent and enjoyable watch. Not as bad as some of the reviews make out to be.",Mulan
498,hollandvillage,"Pleasantly surprised with the 2020 rendition, as I was expecting worse.....",8,7 September 2020,"From some of the worst remake from Disney in the recent years with ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King"", I wasn't really expecting much with ""Mulan"" as well. However, all I could say after watching the movie, that I am quite pleasantly surprised with the finished product.Sure there are some contrive moments with how the plot developed, especially towards the end when Mulan single handedly defected the enemy to save hundreds of soldiers and how she again single handedly rescued the Emperor from the evil Bori Khan. I just feel that the ending parts were a bit rush, without much of a proper lead up to how she got there.Nevertheless, there is definitely heart and soul in this movie with the main characters development (unlike the last few Disney remake movies, which is really a whole pile of mess, relying plainly too much on just the CGI & special effects). Mulan played by Liu YiFei is definitely the right choice for the role. She plays the main protagonist with enough restraints and yet at the same time, as a viewer, one could tell that there is a lot of internal dialogues and turmoil going on in her life (especially with the choices and decisions that she has had made along the way, to lead her to where her final success is being brought about). Even the evil witch role played by Gong Li has her own peaks and valleys in the character, narrating her own story in her own way. She is just not a clear cut evil person, but just someone trying to live her own mark as a women living among the men in a Man's World. As much as she was the evil witch in the movie, I can totally see her be acceptable and probably be label more of a gifted new age psychic in today's modern context. It is clearly shown in the movie that Mulan is the new wave of leading female role, taking over the destiny of her own life, as compared to her predecessors in which this case, the evil witch or even her own mother have had failed in the past.As someone coming from an Asian Chinese background, I can definitely relate to how the whole filial piety means to one's family growing up and in this case also the entire country as such. Obviously the world has changed in leaps and bounds, in terms of some of the older fashioned ways of thinking that the female is of a weaker sex. As such, I can truly see that this new 2020 rendition is especially catered to a new generation of female growing up in today's modern world. On the side note too, this movie is directed by a female director and that certainly helps to bring the narrative across too. Somehow, after having seen quite a few movies, being directed by female directors, there is just some extra ""je ne sais quoi"" elements in their movies that most male directors just fail to bring.",Mulan

Etc. It made sense. But honestly, I still really missed it.I thought overall the movie was excellent and definitely worth paying the premium price.I personally would've changed a few things and wasn't totally and completely satisfied with the ending, but I still really enjoyed it.

502,johnhow-82589,What's wrong with Disney?,4,5 September 2020,"You can tell if a movie is going to be a well-produced one by its first 10 mins or in some cases, merely 5 mins. This Mulan movie at the beginning shows off the young Mulan jumps effortlessly onto a high roof to chase a rebel chicken. She slips off the loose roof tiles but flips upright with ease as she plunged to the ground. Nothing wrong in setting up the story in this manner but it's the way they made her Kung Fu-ed her fall in an obvious stilted style exactly like a puppet on strings.We know Kung Fu heroes or heroines can't leap effortlessly onto a 20 feet high roof and command impossible gravity defying feats by mere light footholds. While the film makers can remove the strings and harness digitally, but they don't have to have the actors moved like they are on strings. This is the same as with Michelle Yeoh's The Touch (citing one example of similar genre) her stunts there are painfully difficult to watch and appreciate. Yeoh just as Disney's Mulan's YiFei Liu can proved to be A-class actors in the hands of a better director and stunt choreographer.The choice of Mulan's father played by the indefatigable and veteran Chinese actor, Tzi Ma, could be more convincing given another Chinese actor.Also, film makers could have avoided the temptation to employ generous use of CGI just because they could afford it.It's a shame that Disney with all its years of film making experiences and what-money-could-buy resources could have done a better live action film with an inspiring story like Mulan. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Hero, Terra Cotta Warrior, Ip Man series fared better with their flying stunts.",Mulan

But I felt the story didn't need all the changes it had...especially since the main reason people will watch this is due to nostalgia.To continue, it's long, the characters are very forgettable, and the new additions to the story add nothing.It's an ok movie, but you will be upset if you pay 30 for it, like really upset...Pro's:

However, it didn't turn out as good as it should have.The problem here, I believe, lies in the way the filmmakers directed the film. The drama part in the beginning of the film could definitely had been better. In the animated version, I always end up really emotional, but this one didn't make me felt sorry for Mulan as much as I should have. I know it's Disney, so I shouldn't expected it, but I think the film would had been a success if they had decided to make the film a full-blown action drama film. It would have opened many new opportunities for Disney.Moreover, sometimes I felt like I was watching one scene and then it suddenly skipped to the other scene. The film is a bit too fast-paced. The filmmakers could had given a little more time to develop its characters, so viewers could feel for them.As for the casts, I think they casted the right people, but somehow, everyone seem so emotionless in the film. It was a waste of talent. As for the lead, Liu Yifei was great as Mulan. I don't care about her political view, but as an actress, I think she is fitted for the role.

Xianniang tried to kill Mulan at first, and then tried to persuade Mulan to join her. However, Mulan always knew her responsibility: to protect her homeland and protect her monarch. Only when she truly understood and released her heart could she become a powerful person, even if she was punished by military discipline . In the movie, Mulan takes off his male military uniform and spreads his hair on the galloping steed with the background music reflection, which is very exciting.

It isn't, by a longshot, the same world.Kudos to the cast and crew. This Mulan kicks....Oh, my bad. Disney movie.Mulan rocks.",Mulan
524,phiup,"Kung Fu - good, Empowering woman - meh",5,7 September 2020,"I genuinely believe that outside of biology, men and women are people and people pretty much the same. Some people think cilantro taste like soap, some people put it on everything.
The old way of keeping women in women roles was hit upon greatly in act 1. But it didn't deliver. In act 2 it built up this sentiment by coupling it with the high goals of honesty and truth as means to honor your family, your clan, your country. In act 3 it just turned on a dime as though nothing from act 1 or 2 had any bearing. The powers that be just said, ""welp, guess we will give you the keys to the kingdom then since you didn't want to stay in your place."" WEAK SAUCE!In the cartoon it built on this idea by sparing mulan's life because she saved the captains life, but that she was hence forth banished. It was only when she went against that banishment at risk to her own life, that she taught the captain that even a woman could do right thing.So many things could have been done to enhance the message that women are equal...but if they wanted to just show that women are equally as powerful as men, then why play the gender card in acts 1 and 2. They could have just told a fictitious retooled version of mulan in which the army was already co-gendered. Done.But this movie took this otherwise powerful message and just flopped it. If I show this to young ladies and girls in my life, the only lesson I can teach them from this is that it's fiction and if you really believe in something you have to fight for it. Not just have all the opposition bow and curtsy to your defiance and cultural taboo behaviors.This is the only Disney Princess I liked because she felt real. This movie made her feel fake by making all the supporting cast treat her the way they did when she revealed who she really was.But the kung fu was good.",Mulan

And for a movie where a literal war and multiple battles happen, people get stabbed and shot by arrows, not a single drop of blood in the entire movie. Not one finger-cut or even a little scratch.

526,chloeurc,Chinese Wonder Woman? Maybe,7,5 September 2020,"My MULAN REVIEW (pros & cons)
(Minor spoilers)
Film: 7/10PROS:
1. The cinematography of the film is really beautiful, the scenes and colors are great and really feels true to the beauty of China. For anyone who is familiar with the China pavilion at Epcot in Disneyworld, you definitely get that vibe as well! Lots of reds and yellows in the film, you can tell it was meant to be in theaters.2. The characters are likeable in this film, especially some of the boys who she has to train and live with while she's an undercover soldier. Mulan herself isn't bad although she is on the quiet side, she has a sweet relationship with her father and really values family much like the original. Villains are also interesting and different than the original, but in a good way.3. Different added element in the story about Mulan. In the original, Mulan goes to fight alongside the soldiers and does know much about sword fighting or training whatsoever, which isn't realistic considering how fast she becomes an amazing fighter, in the new Mulan however her upbringing is similar but not really, she isn't quite clueless. She makes different decisions but in a good way. You have to watch it, it's makes more sense for the story.4. Without giving anything away there are also things they obviously added to the story and about Mulan and her family that are really nice, some things that would have been awesome if they were in the original. They pay homepage to the original in cool, creative and great ways too. One point my family all went ""HEY!!"" and pointed at the screen during the film (but I won't give it away).CONS:
1. Yes, it's not a musical and there's no Mushu. Some of the fantastic things you love about the original are not there unfortunately. They tried to fill in those blanks by doing other things but it still would of been much better if they had at least added one of the two.2. Mulan has a different personality. While it may make more sense for the story and culture it felt weird that Mulan was so quiet! In the original she is extroverted, argumentative, and sometimes silly at times, but in this one she's very much of a serious girl who loves her family and loves her culture and her kingdom. While her personality change isn't bad, it felt like the casting may not have been quite on point.3. Not on the same scale as some of the other live action remakes. The new Beauty and the Beast and the new Maleficent were 8/10s for me, but this one wasn't quite there. Close but not quite. The plot of the film was different than the original although they kind of are all getting that way, it didn't feel as strong.4. Things from the original are not there. Without pointing out each thing there are several elements and scenes that the original had that this does not. A big character Shang is not in this one but is replaced with an older (more age realistic) general while a soldier that is Mulan's equal befriends her. Even though the difference in the male character's military title isn't bad, Shang is such a cool character in the film and it's a real shame he wasn't there.It still is a good movie. Could they have done better? Yes but it wasn't a fail. I think the director was trying to make a Wonder Woman type character which I am all for, but because it strayed from the original happier version, it wasn't an 8 or above for me. Mulan is still awesome though, and she is still my favorite Disney princess, or should I say warrior ⛩.",Mulan
527,mommedahmed,Beautiful & inspiring,7,5 September 2020,"Honestly I've enjoyed watching the movie, this is an achingly beautiful movie. The filmakers were deliberate about creating stunning visuals and succeeded - Mulan is one of the most beautiful movies you'll see this year.but there were many ups and downsUps: It's unfortunate it isn't getting a theatrical release since it's a stunning visual spectacle. MULAN is visually gorgeous and one of the better live action remakes. Impressive fight choreography and inspires and challenges its younger audiences every step of the way.While the film as a whole doesn't set the world alight, it's refreshing to see a Disney live action remake at least tweak the plot and characters to liven it up. The cinematography, choreography and sound effects are all high points.Mulan, enlightened feminists who understand that women empowerment can only happen once they have risen to the challenge and stopped portraying themselves as perpetual victims.downs: She was flipping through the air, kicking spears out of the air and deflecting them back at the bad guy.
& Suddenly all his soldiers disappeared and the villain must burn the emperor alone & the movie got rid of so many good things from the original and they don't even got mushu or general shang like bruh seriously? I personally hate that mulan is played by a person who supports police brutality.....Thx for reading, Enjoy watching the movie & judge by yourself :)",Mulan

529,shay-67903,they should have kept it unpublished,3,4 September 2020,"In 1 sentence:
If you like all the new Disney remakes where they squiz any part of nostalgia out of you and remove all the magic that made Disney Disney,
so you will love this movie.Also if your among the 5% who know the real folklore story of mulan before Disney changed it, you will also love this movie as it follows the ""real"" or should i say the ""authentic"" story much closely.but there was a reason Disney changed the real story the way they did !
Disney took the original story and added what i can only describe as ""magic"" in it. bright colors, love story, music, and fun.
so yea.. NONE of these exists in this one.I had so much hope for this movie as a huge Mulan fanbut really Disney should have really kept it unpublished, as ad least i would think it's amazing.This story is just the folklore story of Mulan and lacks all the magic that Disney put to make that story pop and amazing.
if you want a real drama just watch any other story that follows a folklore tale there is 9999 better movies that does that (hell there is even 152 movies for Hansel and Gretel that tries to follow the ""real"" folklore and i'm ashamed to say some of them are better then this one).it was Obviously set for cinema with huge sound parts that can come out as amazing if you would hear them with a surround system in full volume on a 10m screen, but come out as a bit flat on normal TV with normal sound.
same goes for the amazing effects, that just look as normal effects in normal lcd screens.so what you get when you watch it at home is:
a medicare movie with good effects, ok songs and decent acting... nothing more, and def. not worth the 30 usd .yea if i would see it in the cinema i would get
great songs in surrounds, with great detailed effects, and just a fun way to pass 90m. and maybe worth the 8usd cinema ticket.so for home ? 3\10 easy .
for cinema ? maybe 6\10 as it has enjoyment in it.",Mulan
530,ladyliliroche,I wish it was better,3,6 September 2020,"They wanted to be more realism? But it ended up being ridiculous. Story and script should be stronger. The dialogues are cringy sometimes... some stuffs, like motivation and relationship should be explored more.I dont fancy the changes that they did on the character Mulan too. With her being the chosen one and this thing with chi as magical forces... like please... chi is not for man only, or we wont have cool women warriors like the snake lady from that Andy Lau's series or the one from crouching tiger hidden dragon.I just wish everything was better... it didnt need to be scene to scene like beauty and the beast or lion king (which i found both hollow. Only the jungle book deserved the remake in my opinion). It just need a better story scene and script.Also on the side note, it would be more interesting if they erase all this magical power and has Gong Li's character to be someone who used deceit and hidden tactics, pretending to be a witch for the fear factor instead of actually being this half bake chi witch.",Mulan
531,GuilhermeTeixeiraSilva1002,Disney fail...again.,6,15 September 2020,"Despite this being the best disney adaptation its not free from easy solutions and lack of character development that could downgrade the development of the movie it self.
The story everyone knows, it's a girl who takes her father place and go to the war risking her life or her family honor.
At the beginning it's kinda confusing who is the main villain but as the story goes it seems more that ""the witch"" takes the primary role and the actually main villain from the animation takes a secondary role until the 30 or 15 last minutes.
Even in the animation the villains weren't that interesting, but at least they work very well when it was necessary to impose fear. But here the lack of personality is quite disturbing and it gets worse when u see the ""the witch"" swapping side just because Mulan like her speech. Dude really how superficial someone can be.
Now, I know we are talking about a disney movie, yet the decision of taking the dragon and the other guy,wich were actually what boost the animation with there sense of comedy, I think it could be compensated if they went through a darker and maybe bloody movie. There's a battle scene between the 2 armies and there's no drop of blood. Even the animation was darker. There's some decision that I didn't agree, like when mulan is in one place and over sunddently is in another. I think the picture would gain more if they show how difficult it actually was to do all of that.
Another thing that I think they could change was the Mulan story arc. Instead of making her badass just because she already was a badass and all it took was to reveal her truly Identity, they could make a longer arc where mulan doesn't have any special hability and she becomes a badass because she was able to go through all the difficulties.
Other things that bother me was the CGI that sometimes made me feel that I was watching a movie from a low cost company; the movie is too long for the story that propose to tell and the actions scenes are competent despite one or two of them being quite bad. Basically if u saw any good action movie you will feel that u already saw better scenes.
Despite all that the movie is quite entertaining since they kept the core of the picture from the animation, so you will have a great time, still the animation is way better.",Mulan

At many places the story didn't make sense (I think they forgot that this is not an anime where the timeline doesn't need to make alot of sense). The movie didn't really explore the feminist theme as well as the anime did, choosing rather to spend more time in the training camp (yet they totally left out any growth about her powers). Its sad that we didn't get to see anything about Mulan's chi. There is alot to be disappointed about in the movie, but i still didn't feel bored as the visuals were done so beautifully, it can actually keep you engaged till the end. Sad as it could have been better though. I would have given it 6 stars, but subtracting 1 in solidarity with Hong Kong. The whole world is with you in your fight to defend your freedom!!

My second thought was ""the writers must have really liked Frozen!"" Seriously, did they just want to re-make Frozen? (And I love Frozen!) That might sound crazy at first, but hear me out.
1. They inexplicably gave Mulan a sister, who is barely integrated into the story at all.
2. Mulan has barely explained magical powers, and feels isolated. She is distressed over having to conceal her magic. She feels isolated within her family and community. Sound familiar?
3. It ends with Mulan embracing her sister and declaring their love for each other. Mulan does not have a traditional love interest.
Not related to Frozen, but also, what is with the inconsistent narration? And the Phoenix? So stupid! It's like the writers forgot that they added several elements to the story! They didnt seem to have any clear idea of what they wanted to do with these story elements!
I also feel like they sucked all the joy, humour, and personality out from the original movie.
The awkward pacing is one of the worst elements of this movie. There aren't enough establishing shots either. Characters just seem to appear places. I kept asking myself ""what just happened? How did they get there? What day is this supposed to be???"" I could go on, but why?

550,jlcp-photo,It's not the same movie; get over it.,7,17 September 2020,"This movie is very different to the animated film: there's no singing; there's no Mushu; there are lots of typical Chinese martial art action scenes (i.e. people running straight up walls/basically flying); there's a new villain; the ending is different.... And that's okay. Stories don't all have to be told in the same way. Sorry that you might be upset about that. Here is a review of the film from someone who isn't heartbroken that it's not identical to the animated movie. (Seems like I am one of the only people here who thinks that way.)IMO, live-action Disney adaptations that follow the animated version frame by frame are boring as hell because you know what's going to happen. At the end of the day, this movie is about a woman showing us she can do exactly what men can do - if not more - and she saves her kingdom through her persistence and intelligence, not just her physical strength. Is that not the message of the animated film? (She also brings the more ""feminine"" idea of love/family into what are considered prized virtues. Yay.)This rendition of Mulan naturally has a lot of power; but the crux is that she can only harness that by being true to herself as a woman, not by being deceptive and trying to pass as a man. So there's some weird chi-related stuff. You're not okay with that but you wanted a talking dragon? You can't have this woman accept herself and her strength unless Eddie Murphy helps her to do so?For people wondering about the witch: she represents what Mulan *could* have become based on the biases at the time. The witch is ""evil"" because she was cast out for being a strong woman and sided with the only people who would tolerate her. Mulan, luckily, gets to show her country her strength and be appreciated for it on the ""good"" side.Mulan's character isn't as fleshed-out as it could be; additionally, the story is weaker in parts and seems rushed in some sections (in particular when she is turned away by the general only to be accepted back minutes later and put at the head of the group to save the Emperor). However, it is a solid story of intelligence and perseverance and the action scenes are fantastic, which somewhat makes up for the lack of character development.Although it's not a musical, if you pay attention, some of the songs from the animated film do make their way into this edition. Also, some of the lines from the animated movie are repeated in this. (Mulan was my favourite ""Disney princess"" when I was a kid so I really noticed these nods to the older movie.)In short, this film has its flaws but I thoroughly enjoyed it as a new take on a classic.

This is some of the worst writing I've ever seen in a cinema history, I hope the writers never pick up a pen again. The dialogue is so cringeworthy and just flat out embarrassing, at times I honestly thought I was watching a chinese film dubbed in english. As for the storyline, it's pure garbage. Everything you loved about the original Mulan, this film completely ignores; Mushu isn't in it, the cricket isn't in it, the three funny friends Mulan has aren't in it and most importantly Shang-Li isn't in it. The fighting scenes are so mediocre that it's sad to watch, I can't get over the fact that they had a 200 million dollar budget for this movie when the cgi in this looks like something from a 2000s chinese tv drama. There is absolutely nothing good about this movie, the only reason I'm giving this a 2 is because I had some good laughs on how bad the dialogue was. The new storyline is filled with so many plot holes that you just yell out WTF every 15 minutes, so many things make no sense, even the costumes look pretty bad at times. The lead actress shows no emotion at all, she has no idea how to act. Maybe Disney thought her status in China would make this movie more successful, but in that case they should've gotten a Chinese actress who can actually show facial expressions. I have a pretty good idea of why Disney decided to make this movie the way this is, it's clearly suppose to be catered towards Chinese audiences, but even all the cultural pride can't overshadow how bad of a movie this is. If you we're planning on boycotting this movie because of politics, you can now also boycott it for being a disgrace to cinema and writing.

That being said, this live action adaptation takes more inspiration from the legend of Hua Mulan than the 1998 animated version does, which I find to be fresh. It's a very colorful movie, and the richness of color combined with beautiful backgrounds and landscapes, as well as set pieces makes it a feast for the eyes. The movie is also well choreographed and the fighting is very believable, and the score and music are also very well done.The characters of Hua Mulan and her father all feel really fleshed out. There is very little character development other than that, sadly. The rest seem almost like cardboard-ish cutouts. Also, there is very little humor and the absence of the character of the wisecracking sidekick Mushu is very noticeably felt. (Although, the lucky ""Crikee"" does make an appearance in one scene).Also, it's clever that the filmmakers snuck Ming-Na Wen (the voice of Mulan from the original animated movie) into a cameo towards the end of the film.It's not a bad movie whatsoever.

560,stopeeper,Generic,2,10 September 2020,"A prime lesson how to gut out a classic animation and turn it into a generic low-fantasy movie. The movie is your typical Chinese production - a semi-historical, semi-realistic setting, with a sprinkle of absurd fantasy elements on top. As well as the usual melodrama and patriotic gibberish. There's a ton of mix messaging and tonal changes in the movie. In one scene Mulan is presented as some chi ninja wunderkind, in the next she's training hard alongside her fellow soldiers. In one moments she's kicked out of the army for being a woman, in the next she's leading the army in defense of the emperor. There's a side character that is probably the most inconsistent and ridiculous character I've seen in a movie. There was not a single scene in the movie with this character that didn't make me shake my head in disbelief.
Disney really wanted to get the Chinese market with this one. And I guess they did a good job at it, you can hardly get more Chinese than this.",Mulan
561,ryancortero,I paid $34.99 + tax for Mulan so you wouldn't have to,2,14 September 2020,"DO NOT go into this movie expecting the animated film. Most of you already know from the trailers there's no Mushu and no songs. You can tell that they're doing something different so you need to try to go into this movie with an open mind as much as you can.That being said, this movie was disappointing to me. It tries to blend the old Chinese legend of Mulan with the animated film and it doesn't work. I would've liked if they only focused on one. Even if they just made a literal live-action movie of the animated one with little changes (like Beauty and the Beast, or Aladdin), at least it would feel like a complete story. I wish they focused more on the legend so it would at least feel different and new.Most of the behind the scenes crew are non-Asian people, specifically white and it sucks that that's the case. Yes, they have an all Asian cast but I don't feel a celebration like how Crazy Rich Asians felt. I just didn't feel for the characters too much, and the writing didn't help as well. I also feel that they were a lot of things cut from this movie. There are so many moments where a scene ends abruptly, and when they go to the next one, it feels like you're in the middle of it.I could go on but the rest makes more sense once you actually watch, which I DON'T recommend. At least, don't pay $34.99 for it. It's coming to Disney+ with no extra cost on Dec 4, so I say wait until then if you really want to watch it.",Mulan

It feels like it wants to be original then it wants to be the 1998 version. The problem with the films writing is probably because of 4 writers not being able to decide what they want to do with this film.So first Mulan now has ""Chi"" but forgets about it at the final act. Then it wants to be like the 1998 film but then switches back to ""Chi"".Overall Mulan is a film that's plagued with bad writings but the only thing I enjoyed was the cinematography.Overall it's a C- for me.",Mulan

They also avoided the mushy romance in the cartoon version and made only subtle allusions to it, and decided not to make it a musical which was a a good call. I also think the Gong Li witch character real enhances the film. Also no jokey, talking dragon! The 4K Bluray looks incredible on my OLED 4K TV played through my Oppo UHD player. The colours just glow from the screen. This and Aladdin, are the in the top 5 of my 4K films where the colours just take your breath away and make the extra cash for a 4K film really worth it.

Unlike Aladdin or Beauty and the Beast which indeed were faithful re-creations of the original, Mulan is a failed re-imagining with a different story, different characters, different settings and basically different everything. To add insult to injury, Disney introduced ""super powers,"" like WTF?The biggest problem is perhaps the tone of the movie, what is it supposed to be? A charming mix of comedy, action, drama and musical like the original? Nope, this Mulan is pathetically trying to be a market-tested Marvel superhero blockbuster. It's doomed from the beginning.I think the great cast has been completely wasted, but the portrayal of ancient China is quite interesting, the intriguing but I'm sure not at all historically correct costumes, beautiful architecture and scenery made an otherwise terrible movie visually stunning, but these are about the only nice things I could say about Mulan.All in all, a lot of wasted potential here, this is what always happens when every decision is made corporate executives with MBAs rather than actual filmmakers.",Mulan

Of course as a Disney film you would expect flaws, but this time the writers and the director used considerable restraint so as not to make it too ""Disneyfied"", as they tend to do all too often. An inspirational story-line for younger girls, was enhanced by, fantastic visuals and an interesting and at times informative historical backdrop, that helped those ignorant of ancient China, to visualize an imagined time and place different from their own. Also you can't be too picky about historical detailing when this movie tends to also pick up on some of the old Japanese movies of earlier times I remember watching. Although very different, Akira Kurosawa movie ""The Seven Samurai"", there were a number of attributes that were certainly taken from other early Japanese movies, such as farcical characters, magicians, witches and sword fighters that climbed up vertical walls, the list goes on. Also we should not forget that this is first a fairy tale for kids, so we should not expect absolute historical accuracy. Mulan 2020 is meant to entertain in an acceptable package aimed at kids, especially young girls. It's fictional entertainment first and foremost, after all. I also think the overly precious critics who panned Mulan 2020 for not being true to the animated version or thought it should be like a documentary on ancient China, should grow up and smell the fairy floss. Mulan 2020 is nothing like Mulan 1998 - and was never meant to be - and for that I for one am eternally grateful. I am sick of police shows, serial killers and most American comedies, so for me this movie was a pleasant change and very watchable, I give it a 9, I really enjoyed it. So there.",Mulan

But let me just say that I believe Disney does not want to remake a new movie and have it be exactly like the original. This was a good take and a totally different version of Mulan, I loved the idea of making Mulan more adventurous from a young age, and her wanting to be more expressive than any other woman in her village. I understand fans wanted to see Mushu, Crickee, Captain Shang, Yao, Chin Po, and Ling. But at least the movie did have a Po and a Yao, but if you want watch this movie, you have to watch it with an open mind and not hold comparisons to the original.

People are saying that the animated one is better just because it was their childhood favourite etc... Ignore the haters and don't believe the bad reviews. This doesn't deserve the 5.4 rating on imdb. It's almost a masterpiece except for a few problems. Great job by director Niki Caro and Liu Yifei was great as Mulan. Overall wonderful movie for the family to watch and it is definitely worth spending $30. Second best remake after Aladdin 2019. I loved it so much that I aldready watched it 10 times. A tip to liking this movie- Just don't compare it with the original and watch it with an open mind and don't politicize it. Though it's not perfect, it is actually a good movie.

This is a different version of Mulan. I'm very confused about this movie in comparison of animated version. For me the best and emotional moment was she showed who really her was and left to fight to her nation. But the movie have some fails and the narration was so fast that didn't convince me and the actors didn't convey emotion in their roles although the film has its moments. Even so, the movie is visible but it is so far from suprassing the classic Mulan. The movie lacked emotion, love, romance and what we all expected, Mushu. But keep in mind that the director wanted to make a more realistic version of the animated one, even so, having played even more with the fantasy and the beautiful songs that existed in the classic version of Mulan would have been great, but I loved the melody of '' Reflection '' depicted in the movie.",Mulan

If you have seen the animation movie prepare to be very disappointed. Most of the epic scenes are not there, there is no drake guard instead there is a Phoenix made with bad Cgi that looks like a kite.

That is what it shares with the animated movie. The dragon is replaced by a phoenix, now the problem is that despite phoenix existing in chinese mythology (Fenghuang), they don't represent resurrection, they are immortal, they writers didn't even use google. Then we have Shan Yu's eagle, they did the same they did in Maleficient with the raven, turned her into a woman (a shapeshifter witch). I liked the character, I don't know if there are witches in hun mythology, but they didn't mixed it up like the phoenix.Don't expect any music from the original movie, not even the instrumental one. And that beautiful song ""Loyal, Brave, True"". It is only in the credits. It is like they didn't know anything about the audience.Finally, this Mulan is too OP, she dodges arrows like Neo and does CGI parkour. The first wouldn't matter in another movie, the problem is that it seemed out of place.I give it 5 stars because despite all I enjoyed it, but I would give it more if they hadn't added that cringy things and commited that mistakes. I really don't understand what they wanted to do, I thought they removed elements from the animated movie to make it more realistic or to make it match the mythology but they did it wrong.",Mulan

Now, not only they removed the dragon but they replaced it with a phoenix that looks like a kite and they talked about resurrection, when the chinese phoenix (Fenghuang) doesn't do such thing. They wanted to add chinese mythology and they did it wrong.And instead of making Mulan a normal woman who proves that she is as capable as the men after some training, she is OP since she is a little girl because she is blessed with a strong Chi.

Cutting the singalong out great idea! No one expects a warrior to burst into a stage song the night before battle.

The fact of the matter is that this film actually did have a lot going for it, especially considering that they changed so much about the story, but at the end of the day, it's just another soulless cashgrab of a remake. Character development was quite shallow, a lot of the editing in the action sequences was really bad, the pacing of the story was uneven, and overall it's such a letdown. To be honest, I had some hope from this movie because the film didn't seem like another shot-for-shot remake (UNLIKE ANOTHER DISNEY REMAKE THAT WE WON'T SPEAK OF), but I'm honestly not impressed with the final product nor am I surprised by my disappointment in the slightest. Deep down, I knew this movie was going to be mediocre.Disney is successfully conning people who worship the Mouse out of $30 for a single mediocre film.

I'm not saying that this version of Mulan is as good as Jackson's Lord of the Rings, but it is very good.What let's it down is playing it too safe. It feels like a bloodless Game of Thrones. In a way, it's a shame that Disney felt constrained to make a small-child friendly movie, as this could've been excellent with a bit more bloody realism in the fight scenes to give it a more believable sense of feudal viscerality, and show the human cost of Hua Jun becoming Hua Mulan.Mostly good story, and excellent acting from Yifei Liu and ensemble cast, although chief baddie is a a bit ham.",Mulan

Witch character had a change of heart last minute??

It's a solid movie, but it doesn't have much to offer. The messaging is fairly simple. While this film isn't bad by any means, it doesn't excel at anything. It's a very average film that you will watch once and never really feel the need to revisit. The animated version is far superior. My only real complaint with this film is the way they handled Mulan. Bringing in the magical ""chi"" element made her a sort of ""chosen one""; as a result, she doesn't face much conflict throughout the film and doesn't really grow as a character. It would have been better to not include this chi and, rather, have Mulan achieve her caliber of strength and power through hard work as opposed to some magical element. All in all, it's a basic Disney remake that I will forget about in an hour. Doesn't do anything wrong, but it doesn't really do anything great.",Mulan

The color and composition are really beautiful and will definitely shock you in the cinema! I have to say that the martial arts really sa! The story about Mulan and her father makes me cry. On the basis of the animation version to add new elements, and sublimation of the theme, the awakening of female power and loyalty and true spiritual core must be able to inspire many people!

It is a feel good one and since I haven't seen the cartoon I didn't make any comparisons or had certain expectations except of being entertained. And I was. I enjoyed it fully and lived the emotion. I think in the end this is the point of this movie.I was lucky enough to be able to watch the movie on a big screen (in my home theater) which is the way this movie should be watched. So I think it lost a bit by being shown only in streaming. But nevertheless, I really recommend it as a beautiful and enjoyable movie.PS: if it would be to make a comparison, I would say that I liked it more (much more) than 47 Ronin, a movie in the same vain.",Mulan

They changed a lot in this adaptation. They got rid of Mushu the dragon, and replaced it with a Phoenix that was CGI that you only see a total of 3 times for no more than a fly by each time. Since it was CGI they could of made it have more of a role. They also really didn't spend a lot of time creating relationships between Mulan and the other soldiers. They didn't have any musical numbers either. And the final thing is if you like Chinese Japanese film with samurais and old Asian war films you would like this film. It felt like any other movie in the genre but as a Disney movie they just almost made it a background not of the original Mulan and they just made the main characters name Mulan. Which apparently in their mind is enough to justify it as a Disney movie.",Mulan

616,snmeesala101,"Stunning, Moving, and an Exploration Where the Animation Had Failed to Go",8,9 September 2020,"I hardly ever comment but after all the weird and unfair hate this movie is getting - here I am. Let me start by emphasizing that I'm absolutely fan of the animated Mulan fan and have been from childhood. My very first pair of shoes were Mulan light-up shoes! However, despite many of the movie critics ('cause what do they know right?) liked the movie, some of the audience's critiques (some baseless) started to get to me. After watching the film, I am so glad I didn't listen!I wasn't alone either. I watched the admittedly pricey film with my parents who often get bored with films very easily and absolutely dread childish movies. I was a bit nervous at the beginning when the movie started a little slow but I was relieved to find it was short lived 'cause the movie picks up quickly afterwards. Soon we were laughing, moved, and completely stunned by the beautiful movie all while being on the edge of our seats. I was even crying not even 20 minutes in!I would like to spend the rest of this review answering back to some of the critiques that I've been hearing that I had mentioned above because some are just ... well let's discuss!First and foremost, I felt the film did a much better justice to paint how beautiful, breathtaking, and truly amazing Chinese culture and history is. Are there places where they got it wrong, I'm sure. But is it a step in the right direction? Yes.Second of all, this Mulan rendition gave depth, especially in places in the story that Disney had originally skipped over. One example is how it covered a glaring plot hole in the animation by explaining what exactly was it in Mulan that made her truly different from everyone else to point of her and her family fearing dishonor (giving context to Reflection and Mulan's overall character). It also solidified the supporting cast as actual soldiers instead of being a comedic bunch who happen to be able to throw a punch despite months of military training. Even minor characters such as the the emperor was given more room and not portrayed as a damsel in distress along with the major villain. Each was shown to be a skilled leader with their own goals and history, making me love them way more in this movie than the animated one.Sure there is no Mushu or singing and dancing cast. But now, I'm absolutely glad they weren't in this movie which ultimately uplifted the female empowerment message of the movie. With no Mushu to push her or ""guide"" Mulan, all the burden squarely on her shoulders giving her more agency. Seeing her accept who she is and choosing to follow her heart despite the very real consequences of death or expulsion/dishonor was made all the more satisfying and moving to witness. She didn't need a talking dragon to parent her, especially when it was simply a token character created to make a cultural movie more digestible to an audience who would not have otherwise been attracted to a telling of a cultural folktale to begin with.Side note: I think many misunderstood the purpose of her ""skills"" as something alike to being a chosen one which simply isn't the case because the movie clearly stated that men have skills too. It is only a problem when women possesses the same skills as they are seen then as superhuman or witches. I would like to point out that even in the animation, Mulan was depicted to be the only one who had truly shown to have learned martial arts enough to put into combat use. Comb through the scenes and you will see the difference, that few in the army are shown to progress as far as she does. Rather than viewing this as a chosen one film, I would say that the cartoon and live action Mulan both are quick studies, the live action Mulan picking skills up at an earlier age than the cartoon.No songs were replaced by conversation that achieved the same goal. I almost didn't miss the songs. Don't get me wrong, I still will belt them out whenever the opportunity arises, but now I simply do not look at them the same way. Having that on top of a singing and dancing cast would have made this movie unbearable and cheapen it.Finally this whole ""bad acting"" critique.... I'm sure this is coming from people who aren't familiar with watching foreign movies, expecting each character to fluently speak and express English with an animated face. This being an all Asian cast, with English not being the first language of many in the movie, its unrealistic in my opinion to expect an American accent. So of course the dialogue is going to be appear to be ""choppy"".Now where did this movie fail? There definitely could have been more comedy. At times, especially later, the movie felt rigid and lacked the same charming fluidity that came with the animation. Maybe it was unavoidable because it was dealing with naturally tougher content? Also the action CGI was a little off (for a lack of a better way to describe it) and flamboyant. On the other hand, I see this often with Asian historical action movies. We all know Disney clearly has the resources and money to do better so maybe this was intentional to appeal to the Asian audience? Who knows? But it didn't take away from the movie one bit. There are a plethora of thrilling scenes to make up for it.",Mulan

The problems with this movie are the stale acting, the lack of comedy from the original film, the removal of the outstanding soundtrack and the beautiful storytelling through singing, and the lack of care placed into making the characters. Is it weird that I don't really care what happens to the characters in this? If you've never seen the original, you'll probably think of this movie as okay (a lot of reviewers here have obviously never seen the original).

This is how Mulan 2020 makes me feel; every frame has something wrong in it. What were the writers thinking when they make this up? This film's setting resembles nothing like China historically. And man they screwed up the dialogue. Half of the top billed cast can't even speak fluent English, the accents they have make no sense, particularly Mulan's little sister Xiu , who has a British accent (though she tried to disguise it with American but it just doesn't work). The setting and acting don't look real in general. And they took out Mushu, a character which I actually liked in the original.The Wuxia reference is weird, why introduce these elements when you have no intention of expanding it, not even a bit? And blending magic into the plot just makes the whole thing more confusing.Why Disney tries a serious tone in the storytelling is beyond me. The scene where Rouran army attacking the garrison is ridiculous, the anti-physics jump (That was cool 30 years ago), no blood shed, not even bruises, and you're telling me this is an army attack. The original did a much better job. The sudden cues of family-friendly really sickens me. Again, why try to be serious when you can't?",Mulan

This is the ultimate female empowerment movie. Normally I don't care about that sort of thing, I'm not a feminist, but I love how Mulan proved herself as more than just a woman, and she showed that even though she may not physically overtake a man, she was smart and used her brain in order to defeat the enemy. That's what I took away from the movie.In this version I would say that the part of Mushu was greatly missed (Eddie Murphys voice really enhanced the animated version and no remake can ever top that).
Other than that I would say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",Mulan

It seems like the makers wanted to adapt the story of the animated version, but with their own ideas. I can admire that they are trying not to make an exact copy, but it could have been so much better.The pacing is often way too fast to establish the characters, emotions and scenery. This results in a movie without feeling and dept.
What I disliked the most was the fact that Mulan had some kind of super power... not very realistic. I often thought: ""yeah sure... another impossible move""
Also the added characters were very dull. The witch was not a very strong character, very vague. The sister has no character at all.
All the beloved scenes from the animated Mulan were changed, so it could be more realistic, but it was terrible.
The humor was not funny at all.The only things I did like were the amazing environments. It was often very beautiful.
I almost also liked the fact that they added the phoenix instead of the dragon... untill the phoenix appeared... I thought about Harry Potter, how much more that creature has added to the movie. In this movie it was no adding at all...I would not recommend to watch this movie.",Mulan

Replacement? And I don't want to start about this whole witchy thing that I found completely unnecessary and waste of time, is this Mulan or Harry Potter?I thought that the reveal of Mulan truth identity will be at least dramatic and like this ""oh God nooo"" moment but it.

I liked how they focused on a rigid feel to most of the characters, which I what the original movie portrayed also. What I didn't particularly like was the sets seemed low budget and the costumes seemed too colorful and more like stage musical style. The story did seem patchy and didn't have the best flow. I wasn't fond of the witch. I felt that storyline wasn't necessary. But mostly it did feel hollow.

645,silvijapalosek,I'm still processing whether on not I liked this...,7,4 September 2020,"This film. There's something off about this film and I can't detect what exactly.I think it's the lack of clear personality and forgetfulness of the most characters. There are no jokes, no music here, this is a war film. Even so, I was prepared to give it a chance. It delivered in some aspects, but mostly didn't. The actors... I cannot say they are bad, far from it, but they just don't seem very enthusiastic acting. Maybe it's because they were all speaking English, honestly I do not know hahaha. Also, was the emperor opening his mouth to a voice that was not his own?Very bizzare. I really didn't like that they swapped Mushu with that phoenix who looked a bit like a paper kite in my honest opinion and we couldn't even get a good glimpse of him.Now The Good: Mulan VS Xian Lang dinamic. Great!!! The jin jang paralell was spot on. Their scenes were show stealer.
Hounghui was the cutest ever. I fell in love. I really liked they had a very subtle budding romantic relationship with no kiss. Honestly, that was perfect. And feminism was well handled here, just like messages about devotion to a family and how daughters can look after their fathers too. That was heart-warming. Cinematography is beautiful, as well.Overall, they tried, but while I could watch Aladdin on repeat (not the perfect movie sure) here, I have few memorable scenes to come back to and no characters that are dear to me. Beautiful messages, but executed quite stiffly. Let's hope the Little Mermaid gets it better. Though, Mulan has some of the most powerful messages in Disney. Pity.",Mulan

I mainly wanted to watch it for Donnie Yen, and the fact that they actually got a Chinese cast, and the fact they removed all musical numbers and general Disney cringe from the awful cartoon.So I watched it, and at first I wasn't impressed due to the weirdly incorrect representation of Chinese culture, amongst other similar things, but then I stopped being a critic, and instead actually watched the film, noticing its great action scenes (as I'd expect due to Yen being in the cast, plus a nice surprise appearance from Jet Li.), music and cast (not just Yen, apparently.).

The basic story is the same but no Mushu and all the gags, I adored Mulan, like all the Disney cartoon, but I am very aware Disney made many different kinds of movie, even in the past! With just humans, just cartoons, humans and cartoons, Humans with cartoons and real animals, humans and animals with no cartoon, funny and serious, so, I don't see what the fuss is about.
Even though I've not finished to watch it yet, I think I am pretty sure I know how it'll develop, think of The Wall with Mat Damon, with some of the fighting of ""Crouching tiger and hidden dragon"" if you have not seen either then it is a decent effort by Disney production, and the story of Mulan, the kick ass girl warrior who impersonated a man to help her father is already a winner, don't expect to much and enjoy",Mulan

The way the big battle scenes played out seemed almost like the director wasn't sure how to put it together and it ended up poor. This was the time for Mulan to really show what a warrior she was and I just think the director missed the mark at this part of the movie. Also some characters where not portrayed as good as they could of been like the witch, there was more time spent on us seeing the developing friendships with Mulan's warrior friends then really brining out the evil character leaders and the good leaders and allowing us to really see believable characters, back stories etc. Maybe Disney was having trouble deciding if this was an action movie, teen drama, family, etc., and also it seemed like they weren't sure just how deep they wanted to go with the fighting and killing.

655,Jal4950,Great Family Movie!,10,15 November 2020,"Don't know why this movie got such low reviews. Rented this for my family and they all loved it from the beginning to the end. Plenty of action, empowerment for young girls, and a good moral story behind it. We enjoyed it.",Mulan
656,joneong,What's wrong with these people? It's a beautiful film.,8,5 September 2020,"You must keep an open mind, watch it without thinking of the animation Mulan and you will love this film. Great story telling, great characters and beautiful ending. I don't think that the people who gave a low score really understand the movie. Just watch it. You won't regret it.",Mulan
657,dreamlikediana,She realized who she was and the game changed,9,7 September 2020,"I first want to say I did not at all agree with the price tag Disney put on this movie, but because I've been waiting for it for so long I'm definitely glad I watched it. But $30 is a lot when I usually don't spend more than $10-15 for a movie in theaters, that's with the theater experience. A movie in the comfort of my home should be a lot less. That being said let's jump right into it.In the beginning of the movie, I feared that the acting would be subpar this is only because the young girl they chose to act as young Mulan felt like she was missing the level or professionalism that was expected of her. And the characters around her seemed to gravitate at first to this level set by young Mulan. This changed with a much older Mulan and the main actress who delivered her role absolutely amazingly.Mulan is a tale females need more than ever right now. For thousands of years men told women to be invisible, but some of the most courageous and smartest humans to help change the tides of history were women. It's funny how this message of a female ""knowing her place"" in the 21st century is still prevalent. It's really eye opening that it's 2020, almost 2021, and society still thinks in this old outdated way. I love the story of Mulan, animated version, but bringing it to life can really help broaden a young girl's horizons. For an adult woman, like myself, it makes me feel comfort and solstice through watching this movie. That I chose the right path for myself instead of listening to what society told me to do and expected me to do.Beyond that, seeing Mulan as a child being a tomboy running around being sporty and then being told girls aren't like that to know her place I felt that. I felt that on a deep level. My mom used to say that demeaning stuff to me all the time as a child and while I was growing up. It's like why would you try to make me into something I'm not? Or try to tell me to be a certain way because society doesn't except lively women? Not all women have to be princesses. Some females are destined to be warriors.I love the fact they replaced Mushuu with a phoenix. Since Mulan's story is all about being true to herself and her identity, growing into her skin, accepting herself as she is, being confident in that. It really suits the movie that not only was she solely able to see the Phoenix as her sign or symbol from a higher deity that she's in the right place at the right time in her life. That this choice is meant to be, but also the three virtues of loyal, brave, and true help her grow into that. Realize who she is and the game changes. It's absolutely an empowering feeling!The running up the walls was a bit much, but really I'll let it slide because some people do similar stuff with parkour. The journey of self was just stunning I can't say that enough. The Phoenix is a symbol of identity. Loyal, brave, and true,I usually cannot sit still through any movie for that matter, but I sat through this long one no problem at all. The only thing I paused for was to capture my feelings in the moment what I was feeling. I have a deep appreciation for this film.",Mulan
658,botond-kopacz,Should be titled as 'Woman dressed like men in the woods',1,24 September 2020,"It has nothing to do with the original Mulan, the story is way off.

660,emily-uk,More Marvel than Mulan!!,4,28 July 2021,"So I turned this off after 10 minutes the first time I watched it, once I realised they made it a supernatural movie.I tried it again, going in knowing to expect a supernatural rather than legendary story. The start was bad, the middle training bit was good. The end was terrible.I was surprised that the 1998 version was more ""feminist"" than this modern version. I liked that Mulan was just a normal girl, it makes her bravery that much stronger and I also loved that with practice and determination she became just as strong and skilled as the men. So much so they didn't even notice she was anything different. I thought that was the whole point of the mulan legend!!In this version she is a witch with ""crouching tiger, hidden dragon"" like skills and that is what makes her excel during the training. Also annoyed they gave the bad guy a female partner. So old fashioned that if the main character is female than the foe must be female too.All in all quite a disappointment. If it wasn't pretending to be mulan I might have enjoyed it more but like I said, the whole moral of the legend is lost in the remake.Highly recommend the 1998 animation or the 2009 live action Chinese version.",Mulan
661,kratoslncool,I had a stroke watching this,2,7 September 2020,"Disney did it, they make a movie that even worst than Lion King Live Action. This movie is just Mulan 1998 with all the charm and love boiled away. Nothing makes sense, but there are 3 things gave me stroke watching:
+ Why give Mulan Chi power at the begin, is that the opposite of empowering. In the orginal, Mulan is just original human being who works her best to become stronger and achieve something. This movie, Mulan is born with super power, basically she is done deal at the start of the movie
+ The military leader force people to work hard or .. they got to be sent home. Then why the dad does not just go there, perform like a monkey and got sent home anyway, why
+ Why they even replace Mushu with that witch, the witch make no sense at all. The witch is just a stupid object to point Mulan where to go to the next plot point. And then she die, by taking an arrow in egle form, why she did not just turn into a billion bats like she did at the start of the movie, why
Honestly, I wasted 30$ watching this and it gave me stroke",Mulan

663,jaka6052,Disney... you brought shame upon your family,1,6 September 2020,"This is probably the worst movie I have seen in the last two years. And mind that Mulan still is one of my favourite cartoon movie, so thats quite something to achieve.Let me put it simple, every time the script diverged from the cartoon it was for the worst. They left out the best parts and added the most ridiculous nonsense you can imagine.The Witch: Why add this character? How lazy do you have to be as a screenwriter to only be able to make the story ""work"" by adding a character that can morph into any other character? Betrayal? Complicated motives? Multilayered characters? No - it was just the witch who took over the Kings servant.The Phoenix: Absolutely useless trope. I would argue that the story of Mushu in the cartoon was written better that the whole Mulan 2020 script. This dumb phoenix from the ashes metaphor has been done a thousand times, please for gods sake can these people have one original idea?Loyal, brave, and true. These three words appear like 10 Times through the movie yet absolutely nothing comes from it that wouldn't naturally appear in a Mulan story. Its like making a Harry Potter movie and have the word ""Magic"" appear on every item. Yeah we know, it's a movie about bravery - we have all seen the cartoon.Scenery: The landscapes are beautiful, if this would be a documentary. Did anyone tell the director that the landscapes in a movie need to make sense? I felt like I'm watching an old spice comercial: I'm on top of a mountain, now I'm in the desert, look back to me I am now inside a vulcano.In Summary the movie had three very strong virtues. But I'm not talking about ""loyal, brave, and true"" the three words that come to my mind are ""ridiculous, dumb and lazy"". So yeah, don't watch, don't buy. Just watch the cartoon another time.",Mulan

666,jafhate,My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined,1,4 September 2020,"No mushu, no songs, ok it's fine but the plot man... Come on director.. The plot is all over the floor. This movie is so disappointed. I love the acting and the choice of characters but because of the directing, the movie falls deep down the rabbit hole. For instance, how did mulan teleport behind the enemy and start shooting without the khans noticing. Plus, how stupid it is for them to shoot mulan using a frickin catapult. I mean they literally push the catapult 180° just to aim at mulan, instead of going there and attack by foot. The catapult even missed and caused the avalanche. How can you missed, from afar you can accurately hit the turtle formation but upclose to mulan you can even hit her. How idiocy is that. Plus many more errors in the movie. I am so disappointed. Come on director...",Mulan
667,thediplomat974,Don't bother,5,18 November 2020,"The worst live Disney adaptation.

668,ruipereirareis,One of the best Disney remakes,7,10 September 2020,"Despite the controversies, I really liked this film and I recognize that it is one of the best remakes of Disney together with Maleficent.The cast is good but Li Gong's performance is brilliant.The action scenes are very well done.The visual effects are ok.",Mulan
669,BitingMovieJunkie,What is this?!!,2,10 November 2020,"I'll tell you what it is: one of the worst Disney movies ever. And that could pretty much seal it.
This ""2020 style"" re-enactment of 1998 ""Mulan"" is really obnoxious, unbearable, to the point of being unwatchable. A true mess. Another useless and unasked for ""live action remake"" of an animated classic. In short: another bump. And something more: one of the worst bumps out there (and you gotta bear in mind that competition is hardcore on that regard...).If you'll ever have the guts to watch this, I guarantee you'll keep asking yourself over and over again ""Why am I still sitting here? Why am I still watching this stuff?"" So quickly it becomes an exercise in pure masochism. An act of total abnegation. Bearing through this movie should be considered an heroic enterprise. And that because ""Mulan"" is complete garbage (I know, I know, I'm getting a little repetitive here, excuse me very much).Lemme briefly tell you why. First and foremost I'd like to start by generally stating that the writers and the producers managed to strike out pretty much everything that worked in the animated classic and for reasons unbeknownst to the most of us replace it with... roll the drums... nothing. Absolutely nothing worth noticing or tuning in for. I mean, Mushu, the comic relief, the feminist undertones, the all-around amusement... all that stuff... gone, just like that.
So we are ""gifted"" (for a competitive 29.99$ sum) with a ""brand new movie"" made out of:Zero suspense and zero emotions. And that's pretty much self-explanatory, isn't it? In a nutshell: this is a hollow movie. Compared to which even Warhol's massive 8-hours-long ""Empire"" proves itself to be one of the most intoxicating and exhilarating movie experiences ever;Awful dialogues and screenplay. The reasons why the movie gets ridiculous and unbearable fast, really really fast;""Curious"" editing choices. Take - for example - the avalanche scene. Well, there you have it: a cut right in the middle of the action. In the next frame, Mulan has already magically ""teleported"" herself behind the enemy lines, has already placed a line of helmets like Flash-speed style and is already on the verge of shooting the arrow... Whoah, people! The things you can do with that ""qi""...;Bad directing. Just look at the action scenes. In those scenes the makers are clearly desperately trying to imitate wuxapians and Hong Kong action movies' choreography, and - guess what? - they fail miserably. Five seconds of let's say ""House of Flying Daggers"" are radically better that this entire wannabe epic Disney fare;Cringy rhetoric. We keep being fed all the usual ""family, honor, homeland, true men"" rhetoric. And that's rich for a movie ostensibly ""feminist"". It's like some kind of a reverse cautionary tale that's basically saying to us: you must always serve and revere your family and your country, no matter what, no matter the cost, no matter your own ideals and dreams, no matter if they constantly try to subdue you and harness you. Wow.That ""qi"". Thanks to which Mulan becomes some sort of a 6th century Wonder Woman. That means: no more struggle, no more hardships, no more fatigue under the training process. She's already all-powerful. She's already unbeatable. She's already a superhero. (Of course they did that for the realism. Out of respect for a millennial culture, it's obvious.)Were it all not enough, there's a final issue. Of the major ones. I'm talking about the aforementioned self-described feminism that - the producers would like us to believe - is supposedly behind some radical changes made upon the original movie (think of the exclusion of Li Shang, for instance). I'll be straight: there's no trace of feminism whatsoever in this feature.
The 1998 movie was not only far more intriguing and epic and endearing, it was also widely more modern in nature if you get what I mean. Simply put: widely more feminist, layered and up-to-date. And that's for another episode of ""the dangers of political correctness"", everyone.",Mulan

671,trekpac,Up There With the Very Best,9,7 September 2020,"I am baffled by some low ratings on this movie. In my opinion it is up there with Lord of the Rings. A really good cast, wonderful scenery, excellent plot. It is a really good melding of the West and the East. I expect it to do really well in China because it reflects so many Confucius Chinese values re loyalty, family, honour and so on, not easy to really get from a western perspective. A female heroine also is common in the East, as is mysticism. I watch many Chinese and Korean series on Netflix which have these special Asian flavours. Over time, many in the West will come to love them.",Mulan
672,Steeler92,Not Sure What People Wanted,8,13 September 2020,"I've never seen the cartoon version but my daughter has and she loved ir. I promised I'd take her to see this when it came out in the theater. Well, that didn't happen. Although the price tag was a bit high I decided to shell out the 30 bucks (I'd have paid 50 at the movies). We both found the movie enkoyable. It was dramatic, funny in parts, touching in other parts. The scenery was amazing. I'm not sure what people were looking for in this. Apparently there is a talking dragon and singing in the carroon. I'll pass on both. This reminds me of another Disney movie people under-rated because they didn't understand the point: Tron: Legacy. Just chill out and enjoy a movie rather than getting your quarantined panties in a bunch!",Mulan
673,Nadara_G,Wrong in every way,3,12 September 2020,"I had such high hopes for this movie. I knew it could not come close to the original but still. However this was just the worst way they could have gone.1. Story - when I heard they decided to take Mushu out of the picture I thought they were going on a more realistic path maybe this adaptation would be close to the actual legend, but if yotu take Mushu out so that it is more realistic than don't add a witch and not the cool kind of witch but the kind that turns into birds with terrible special effects.2. Special effects - horrible, not good at all, it looked like old chinese movies.3. Feminism - I get the subtle massage in the movies, when alongside a good script and great story they put in some inspirational thought, however this one was not executed well at all. When you have a strong well established female protagonist in the story, maybe don't force another female antagonist with the lamest story of all and the lamest ending. The character of the witch was just not needed.4. Action - boring, almost unwatchable, all the best moments taken out.Few good things:
1. The line ""I am blessed with two daughters""
2. scenery, the wide shots were amazing
3. Soundtrack, new version is coolThat's it.My advice, watch the trailer its quite good, listen to the music sound amazing, keep up the hipe, don't ruin the nostalgia.",Mulan

675,lorelei711-73-694918,Giving a higher rating due to those who voted low- here is why,9,19 February 2021,"Okay. I understand why people are upset. I get it. It is a far departure from the animated movie.You have to go in to this movie and not compare it to the animated. The actors were excellent and Liu Yifei is an excellent choice.Why they put elements of music of the original animated makes no sense since there is just the basic storyline (even that departs from the original) in this movie. I do not look at it as a remake but a version of the folklore. There are moments when it is slow, but at the same time there are moments of beauty that lift the movie up. I think that Disney was trying to appease those in China to try to honor the true folklore and they missed the mark in pushing in trying to element any moments of just feeling good about the story. You do want Mulan to succeed. You do care. But at the same time you wish that there was something uplifting moments to pull you in. To really care about ALL the characters. Not just a few at towards the end.I gave the movie a 9 but I would actually rate it a 6.5.Just don't go in expecting the RL versions like they did with Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast which were more like the animated. This movie is nothing like that.I did enjoy it, but I had to think outside the mindset to NOT compare it with the animated.",Mulan

Was so happy that Disney finally went away from the concept of the other remakes, where they just turn cartoons in to real characters, then not much else. Mulan is not about the music or Mushuu, it's about courage, fighting for the ones you love and fighting to be your true self, so it would be so easy to make a good movie out of it. But in stead of Mushuu, they decide to have a witch? Whyy? And the acting is so terrible, cant believe it. And its jumping from one thing to the next, have no characters development or let you get to know and really care for the characters.

But I went into this with a clear mind as Disney said that it was a completely different take before it got released. And me and my family came away extremely impressed and can see why Disney said alot of the things on the original would not work. All I can say is they kept alot of the story about 85-90% intact and changed some things and I really liked it. Just my opinion but I would not go into it thinking of the cartoon.,Mulan

After watching Mulan I was happy not to be the one who have paid for it ; though I was happy to offer a fresh cake to my neighbor for his invitation.Aside from the bad impressions left in all of us from the current global crisis at this time, I noted how hard Disney and Chinese money tried to impress the viewers of almost all types with a live remake of artificial actions, feelings and false heroism.
Has it been a Chinese Pocahontas marrying avengers, so on ?
Even for the audience who wanted to escape from daily hardships and virus scare, such Disney/Chinese marriage could not help. To glorify a chinese hero at this wrong time with a brainless movie as such is next to impossible.

I love how the plot was built around the main character even though it would have been good to show us a background story of the antagonist and the woman who was fighting along side him.

This version is closer to the original Chinese legend especially in the theme (i.e. filial piety and devotion to family). This movie is not bad, but it is not amazing. The biggest problem with the movie is the editing, the film just feels a little choppy. Otherwise the casts were pretty good, and cinematography was good looking, and it was entertaining. Is it worth paying 30 bux? I guess if you have a family then it is worth it because it is cheaper than going to the cinema. However, I do think this kind of movie should be seen on a big screen in the cinema.",Mulan

710,enilorak77,Far exceeded my expectations,8,31 May 2021,"I have to admit I didn't expect much from a Disney live action feature, but this movie was a positive surprise. The beginning captured me completely. I really liked the small changes they'd made in the beginning, like having Mulan grow up a fighter, because they gave more depth and meaning to the rest of the movie. But I do wish that they had kept at least some of the humor from the animated movie because this could become a bit dull at times, especially in the middle. But that could also be due to the dialogue feeling stilted at times, and some of the actors delivering the lines as through they were reading them straight from the manuscript.I do love the choice they made of adding some typical wuxia style fighting scenes, it was very very refreshing and a delight to watch. I also liked that they had added another female character. She had an interesting backstory and added some really cool fighting scenes.I missed Mushu though, but apparently he was left out because of some cultural issues, and the phoenix was added instead. It would have been cool if the phoenix had been more integral to the movie, maybe even having a speaking role, but it was a nice touch nevertheless.The movie would have been brilliant if it weren't for the fact that it lacked that little something extra... It felt a bit flat at times. But aside from that it was definitely enjoyable and well worth watching.",Mulan

-the laws of physics don't exist
-there's a literal Phoenix
-A witch can turn into an eagle, bats and posses other human beingsThe editing is bad, the CHI is awful, the fighting choreography is terrible, the acting is meh.The epic part of the film when Mulan reveals she's a woman is so badly done that you know this is meant to be important but you don't really know why cause it just happens for no reason at all... the training montage is pointless since Mulan can bend the laws of physics since she was a child.But most importantly, the message of the story is entirely lost and Mulan being a woman has no actual consequence in the plot, it's not a ""female empowerment"" film like the animated one... it's just the exact definition of a cash-grab",Mulan
712,slowdive23-1,A Dismal Live-Action Reimagining,5,16 September 2020,"There are quite a few things wrong with this live action version on multiple levels. Instead of writing in paragraph form, I'll just list them out numerically, in no particular order:1. Mulan possesses some other worldly super power that we are supposed to buy. I felt toyed with with this contrivance.2. The extras are poorly directed ~ they gander, gawk, look overly surprised, overact even in distant shots, and point their fingers at the subjects with baffling implausibility.3. The vivid colors are beautiful to look out, but seem to have a high degree of vibrance to hide the artificial backdrops and less than stellar CGI.4. Mulan looks far too feminine around the regiment, and the soldier love interest is way overplayed, as if he already knows her secret. He seems to be catering to her femininity. At one point he gets a good look at her upper backside while she swims in all its feminine curvature, and doesn't notice in the slightest.5. Mulan gets off the hook too easily when her deception is discovered. Seems too Disney friendly. Prior to the discovery, there's also a poor edited scene with her hair down and flowing in the midst of battle, and there's not a single shot of a reaction from a soldier to take notice of this.I did like the actress, who isn't a traditional beauty by any conventional standard. She carries the film well, and does not try to look too angry and tough in close up. There are some heart tugging moments that she handles well enough.Skip this and rewatch the original animated version.",Mulan
713,pavelcristian-48073,Has to be the worst movie I ever seen,1,1 March 2021,"The whole movie doesn't make any sense. Like why Mulan joined the army? She did so to save her father or because as she was the ultimate killing machine that was the only logical outcome? The father thing feels an execuse as even stated later any bad soldier would be sent home so... Just dumb writing and it continues this trend till the very end.
Now about female empowerment.... simply there is none here. The film basically tells us that if we aren't born with superpowers we end up like Mulan sister... aka a loser. Powerful stuff for all kids out there.

The fighting scenes were great, I give them thaf but as a fan of Disney movies even before, you'll definitely be disappointed on how they executed Mulan this time. I mean, even the famous song ""Reflection"" wasn't in the movie which btw the highlight of it. And the scene where she had to cut off her hair that has all the meaning of Mulan's character, was still nowhere to be found. Also, why add a witch where in the 1998 movie, only Shan Yu was the enemy there, no magic, no witch, just him and his army.

NAL!!!!The $30 (split between friends) was worth every single penny and I'm probably going to watch this again and again until I've memorized the entire script. 😭😭😭10 OUT OF 10.As someone who lives and breathes music, I liked this live action version of Mulan (without the singing) MUCH better than the original! There was an additional level of realism and ""humanity"" without the singing. Hard to explain, but once you watch...you'll understand.As someone who also loves fantasy in films, there were still fantastical elements incorporated within the movie that blew my mind. Which leads me to the scenery and the costumes and the underlying score itself...all BREATHTAKING.As someone who LOVES martial arts and swordsmanship, this film had me audibly shook almost the entire duration of the film. Seriously. The fighting sequences and stunts were everything and kept the movie super engaging.I loved how much more closely it resembled the original Legend of Mulan. Even with the ""new"" plots added...this is Disney's best live action adaptation of a film and I'm just really happy about it.It's super disappointing to see so many negative reviews. Makes me wonder how we could have been watching the same film. Mom-relatable characters? Bad writing? That's rubbish. There were still very funny parts in this. For people that says the movie was too ""woke""...seriously WHAT?! The original Mulan was the exact same way!",Mulan
720,seanthezon,Beautifully adapted into live action,9,7 June 2021,"I absolutely loved this film... I don't agree at all with any of the bad reviews, it was an amazing experience for me personally. When I first heard the news of a live action Mulan coming out, I was so excited because this was one of my favorite Disney stories, I would love to see it come to life in cinema form. I have always been a fan of historical films/setting, and so I was hoping and really curious about this one, but I am really glad to say that it exceeded my expectations.This adaptation took the essence of the Mulan story I love and made it into real cinema, more mature, more substance, and overall just resonated with me more and left a greater impact on me than the animated one.. I love the morals that are taught and emphasized in this film, they were inspiring. I like action films, but when a movie also has a heart and soul, meaning, and a desire to leave an impact on the viewer deeper than on a surface level, those are the ones that resonate with me most. I easily prefer Mulan over any MCU or DCU film these days. I was inspired and in awe by the end of this film, it is definitely my favorite Disney live action adaptation and top 10 in my all time favorite movies list.Yifei Liu was wonderful and perfect in her role, I loved her interpretation of Mulan more than the animated one quite frankly... All of the other actors as well, from Jet Li whom I also love, Jason Scott Lee, Tzi Ma, to all the other supporting cast too, all played their parts excellently.I am one who is very lenient with and believes in changes from the source material, as long as it is done right and applied well for the betterment of the adaption. With this one having quite a few changes, I honestly loved every single bit of it. I like how they took out Mushu, giving the film a deeper sense of realism and focused more on Mulan's personal journey in a serious tone. As much as I like Disney musicals and with me being initially disappointed upon hearing the news that the song ""Reflection"" wouldn't be in the movie, finally upon seeing the film I now see why and I couldn't have been more glad they did it that way. It fit perfectly the way they did it, only doing instrumental soundtracks, which were really great by the way, while also adding Reflection in some parts.. It was beautiful and epic whenever the instrumental version of Reflection played, and it fulfilled my craving, as Mulan would not be Mulan without its iconic song. And when it's all said and done after that amazing and beautiful ending, hearing the song both in its English and Chinese versions was just the perfect icing on the cake and I couldn't ask for more. I like the introduction of ""chi"" to the story, I found that much interesting the way they played it out and how it complemented Mulan's personal story. The witch was also great, and I loved the symbolism of the phoenix and how it constantly follows and looks after Mulan throughout, I found that pretty powerful... I even like the way Mulan revealed her identity here over the animated one, where it was done straightforwardly and didn't start a big drama between the characters.. I preferred this ending over the animated one honestly, the action and execution of the ending was better done in my opinion, compared to the animated film where it was a lot of comedy and had a lighter tone whereas this one was more serious and action driven. The execution of most scenes overall appealed to me more, as they were made to be more serious and powerful. Scenes such as the matchmaking in the start, or the traning scenes, which were light-hearted in the animated version, I prefer in the live action.I was in awe all throughout with the action scenes, especially with the ending, and this is coming from a Rurouni Kenshin fan (yes check those films out as well, they are also amazing and beautiful and probably the best samurai action films, or action films in general that you will get to see). The cinematograohy and action choreography was nothing short of stunning, love it. At first I was wondering how they would handle it in PG-13, since this story does touch upon war, but I'm glad to say they did it really well and did actually show some violence too. It didn't feel obvious that they were trying to make it a movie only for kids and for Disney's standards, I really applaud them for that. I also loved the use of slow motion in this film, generally not a big fan of it but this movie is an exception as they just did it so well that it really enhanced some particular action scenes and made them even more amazing.I personally think Disney reached a new level with this film and I am amazed at the fact that in all the years of past, Disney has only ever been in animation and yet after transitioning to live action outside of their comfort zone, they still know how to convey their magic in a different sense and experience even while being in a new, foreign form of media and ultimately of course, still be able to produce great content at the end of the day. I don't know about the other live action movies because I haven't seen most of them, but I speak for Mulan that I loved the movie so much. It was such a beautiful film that took the Mulan story to a whole new level. I think this film will stick with me for a long while and I'm just so thankful that it was made the way it was and that this film exists. Live action has come a long way, and I truly believe that Rurouni Kenshin and Mulan are the best of both worlds, both historical, one being Japanese and the other a Chinese setting. I would love to see this movie with my family someday soon when I get to see them again. So once again, thank you for your magic, Disney :).",Mulan

722,barajasdiego-50877,"Beyond being a good remake of a Disney animated classic, this movie is incredibly beautiful",7,9 September 2020,"From the outset, the film offers a very beautiful visual spectacle and a quite remarkable storytelling style, I felt as if suddenly something bad was going to happen, I felt the feeling of sadness and agony that one feels when someone you love leaves and will probably never return. And after that, you see a combination of moments of self-improvement and spectacular action sequences. Of course, suddenly the movie has its very strange clichés and some filler people that do not transcend so much compared to others. But If I have to give ten to an actor, it is the actress Yifei Liu as Mulan, it seemed to me the best cast they could do for a young warrior who gives everything for her family. Hence Mulan is loyal, brave and true ...In conclusion, Niki Caro's Mulan is an epic, exciting film that at certain points, fails to achieve what the animated version did. But that's why you have to understand that they are very different and that everyone has their own tastes. I really liked it a lot: 8 stars out of ten I give it.P.

But alas, their best isn't enough. Everything about it screams mediocre.I know it is a standalone movie and it has no obligation to follow the cartoon, but one can't help to compare Mulan to Mulan. The cartoon may have a lot of plotholes (such as, why is it the empire of China had practically no troops and had to depend of fresh ones, also it only has one general/one warlord? and one platoon?). But the cartoon has to be praised too for it's funny moments and quirky characters.This live action one has nothing stand out. The witch is just, another witch, just like those in The Mummy or Indiana Jones. The phoenix did nothing worthwhile too. What's the point of inserting her in the movie? The main character is, well, a cardboard character. She has no interest in man. She's the strongest one in her team somehow and she doesn't need help. She beat the big bad by herself. (Compared to the cartoon version where she did it by teamwork). She can't really tell jokes. She did nothing but kick ass and be cool. She's a character that even middle schoolers can come up with. No originality and stand out quirk at all.What a shame. My final score : 6/10. Which fits the mediocrity of this movie.",Mulan

Unfortunately, the release date has been postponed due to the pandemic, but I got to watch it finally. It is EPIC! All the waiting is worthy now.The cartoon version has been very popular, while in the live version the director did a more mature and realistic retelling based on the historical legend of Mulan, instead of a lazy copy. That's exactly what I expect. As I grow up from a little girl, I look forward to deeper and more inspiring understanding of the character and spirit of Mulan.LoyalBraveTrue is the motto of Mulan and also the theme of the movie. My blood boiled witnessing the transition of Mulan from a little girl to a qualified soldier. It wasn't an easy and smooth one. When Mulan left her family and joined the army, her idea was to take her father's place. After overcoming all the difficulty and self-doubt, she finally followed her heart and found her own place. I really appreciate the meticulous depiction of Mulan's growth, and the actress perfectly embodied the strength and grace of Mulan.I am also deeply touched by the graceful dynamic between Mulan and Father. ""I am blessed with two daughters"" is my favorite line. It is the love, trust and support from Mulan's family that encouraged her to fight.In the end, I will not spend too much time talking about the fantastic cinematography, exhilarating action scenes and stunning visual effects, as I am not an expert. The only word I can remember is COOL!I believe Mulan is going to be a role model for everyone, not just girls. Follow you heart and be strong, you will bring honor to us all.",Mulan

754,kmkarina,"Mulan-a strong female warrior, not the same as the original but great",8,23 June 2021,"Yes, I'm watching this later than I should but it's never too late. To begin with, I am a big Disney fan. When I first found about this movie I could understand the hype and now that I've seen it, I can understand the bad reviews as well. Yes, there are some differences between this one and the original but let's give it some credit. I think the ones that call it a remake are wrong. Better to call it another variant of the story.Firstly, I liked the acting. Mulan's fighting skills were amazing making me eager to keep watching. Moreover, I liked the story of the eagle turning into a witch female warrior who ends up meeting Mulan. It's like a paralel between good and evil and how easy is to tip the scales, between what she could've become and what she chose to become.On the other hand, what I would've wanted to see is a real-life Mushu (in the original movie is the little red dragon sent by the Ancestors to protect Mulan on the battlefield). I think it would've been interesting to see such a character especially if they had included the funny moments from the original. I got the replacement they tried to make with the phoenix and although it's beautiful, it's not the same. What I've missed is the less amount of music they put. I agree that the war «doesn't take a break» for them to start singing but let's not forget that the original classical Disney movies are also famous for their soundtracks. In this one, the instrumental was great but simply not enough. At the same time, I think they should've put more emphasis on the father-daughter relationship Mulan has at the beginning because in the original there was such a beautiful father-daughter moment which I would've really liked to see.All in all, it's an interesting movie to watch if you don't compare it side by side to the original or have expectations to be the same. Because it isn't and I think that's the only big disadvantage.",Mulan
755,flowergirlindahe,Sacrilegious,1,9 January 2021,"The animated Mulan is a story of wit, intelligence, determination. This new remake shames on what is meant to be a meaningful and inspiring story to many young women.The crew added a completely unnecessary character that somehow has superpowers. Instead of writing a rich method the Huns stood a chance against the Imperial Army, they added an OP character and called it a day. And can I mantine that Mushu has been turned into an awful CGI phoenix that is meant to portray the message of hope? Very cliche.What annoys me the most is that in the original, Mulan uses her problem solving to conquer challenging tasks set by the guard camp. In the remake, Mulan just does the manly thing better than the men do.After I watched the credits and researched this movie's crew, I realised that none of the crew, writers, directors, anything, are Asian, let alone Chinese. The cast isn't the worst in the world, but it could be better. The mechanics and CGI are very sacrilegious, to take a page out of TwoSetViolin's book.Overall, this movie shames on the original and turns an inspirational story into a rehearsed, cliche, cringe movie. As a Chinese person, I heavily disapprove, and think you need to watch the original animation at least once to cleanse your eyes.",Mulan
756,kiagogs,Its not meant to be like the animation,10,4 September 2020,"This movie was great. Its not like the animation and it's not supposed to be. If you want singing dragons then stick with the cartoon. This had great action, heart and message. I will definitely be watching this again",Mulan
757,dcastellani,Spit in my face again Disney!!!!!!!!!,1,18 September 2020,"I don't even know where to start. If you're a fan of the animated original Mulan as I am than please please do not watch this movie. It is a slap in the face to those who loved the whit, charm, and message of the 21 year old animated film. The movie does not even give us those big moments from the animation In the live action, for example the scene where Mulan cuts her hair and dawns her fathers armor which is a very impactful and emotional scene in the original, is not even in the movie, it is broken down to Mulan pointing her sword at the camera and one cross dissolve later and she's armored up ready for battle. You can forget charm or Disney magic of any kind; it is one thing that this ""realistic"" take on Mulan does not have Mushu (dragon) or the cricket but when you take the music out of the film than you lose what little Disney magic you could have had. Oh yeah and did I mention that in this ""realistic"" iteration of Mulan the main antagonist can literally shapeshift into a bird!!!!! Another strong gripe and possibly the strongest is the message from the original Mulan is completely dragged through the mud in this version. In the original Mulan does what they thought only a man could do, and she did it through her strong will and determination to bring peace to her land and prove that she isn't inferior just because she is a woman. Now that is still the main message in this movie but it has no weight to how Mulan proves that she is better. (SPOILER ALERT) It is revealed that Mulan is special; she has something called Chi which pretty much makes her superhuman. She can run on walls and do insane flips like she's in the matrix and it pretty much just makes her a superhero. And this is where the movie lost me. By saying that Mulan proved everyone wrong and that a strong determined woman could make it in a mans army and world that is perfect, that is the perfect message and the original did it perfectly. But when you say, oh yeah she saved the day because she has super powers and not because she worked harder than anyone else to be the best than that is where you lose me. The standard that this movie sets is not empowering to woman. It tells them that you have to be born special to make a difference. In the original it tells the viewer that if you work hard and never waver than you will reach the top of the mountain. Oh yeah and the other stuff in the movie are terrible as well. The main actress is dull, lacks any sort of emotion, and just seems dead the entire time. The special effects are up to Disney standard(the only good thing about the movie) and the action is terrible, WAY to many cuts. All in all Mulan was a terrible watch and it makes it even worse that I spent 30 bucks on this colossal piece of s**t. I have lost all faith in Disney. I thought Aladdin was bad oh no this movie makes Aladdin look like Schindlers List. I cannot express my deep deep hatred for this movie. If you made it this far thank you very much for reading my rant, and have a nice day.",Mulan

759,pettyperez,Solid live action remake,7,6 September 2020,"First of all, this movie doesn't deserve the hate and harsh criticism that it gets. Everyone who knows the original should not compare the two, because it's unfair. The original from 1998 is
untouchable, but that doesn't mean that this new movie doesn't deserve to have its own moment. In my opinion, Disney will never nail the live action movies until they decide to either go a completely different route from the original or go on to make a carbon copy of the original. With this movie they also tried (like before) to make a mix, but that doesn't work. The scenes that were reminiscent of the original felt out of place and forced. But the brand new scenes and story lines where refreshing and I enjoyed them. Also the fighting scenes were exciting and the actors did a good job.
Also, for me, the story of Mulan can be either a complete children's movie or an epic and mature film for adults. This in-between-movie was nice but the story just has so much more potential and I feel like it got restricted by Disney.",Mulan

The story could have been written by a 6 year old in 2 1/2 hours and there would be no difference. Characters are as flat as they possibly could have been. Music is ok at best but way too quiet during action and the other important moments. ""Action"" is reminiscent of an early 2000 low budget film made by college kids of they were given the CGI of Hulk (2003) and had choreography from 3rd graders. The ""metaphor"" between the phoenix and eagle is as well written as most people's drunk tweets. Cinematography would be mediocre if the action would have been remotely bearable. Pretty good sets, could have had a better final action sequence set but wasn't horrible. Those are just the surface problems.I have never in my life seen a movie that made me want to turn off my laptop and work on homework. Nothing about the story is interesting, the combat is boring and not supported with the score because they have the score so quiet that it's virtually not there. Mulan (1998) was better in LITERALLY every way. They took every good part of the 1998 version and threw them in a dumpster fire behind their local Walmart.The only reason I gave it a 2 star rather than a 1 star is because the costumes were really cool in my opinion, the generals had very intricate armor that clearly had thought out into it.",Mulan

Should have just picked one focus and ran with it.Honestly if this were not about Hua Mulan but some random Chinese girl, it would be a typical high budget but mediocre movie. It felt the ""Mulan"" name was superimposed so they could get the money from the fans of the original Disney Mulan cartoon, but then didn't put in fan favorite elements to please them.If I treat this not as a Hua Mulan story, I'd give it 5.

People won't be turning their back on someone in the first min to trusting and letting them lead on the next one just because she went there to provide the inside information. This is not how human mind works. The animation is well liked because it works as a story, and this film failed because the story failed, not because it's not the animation version.

This is a difficult film to rate due to the contemporary politics of the day, which is too loud for to be able to give it any higher than a 5**Cultural genocide in the region of filming, approval of treaty abuse by the lead star, assimilation practices over various peoples, language loss which carries capital culture.Previous review:There are plenty of adult views, as if expecting adult drama and themes, with blood and heavy action, when It' a 'PG-13', designed for children 13 years old.I also don't get the comparison of the old animated cartoon, which was an appropriation and theft of another cultures mythology, and this is for today's children.This is an excellent movie and encouragement in a patriarchal world informed by imperialist powers, of both internal and external colonialism, where women have found themselves in an unnatural hierarchy, of control, as comes with the commoditization of the natural world.",Mulan

804,migdaliablanco,Very disappointing..,1,22 December 2020,"This movie is NOT based on the animated film Mulan. That aside, even if you see this movie without comparing it to the animated film, there is no really story or plot. This movie makes the assumption that you've seen the original (better) Mulan so you can follow along with what is happening. Watching this with an open mind, this film would've been better as a war adaption instead of a Disney live-action movie. I would've called this 'Threat of the Dynasty Empire' instead of 'Mulan'",Mulan

However the tone and style of this movie is more true to the Chinese folk story. Yes, they added martial arts and some magic, but the original story was very simple, it needs to be spiced up a bit, I liked those touches. The witch character was not well developed and her ending was not convincing, felt very forced and rushed. Some parts were slow, but I thought it was enjoyable overall, probably best of Liu's performance. Nice to see a full Chinese cast.",Mulan

I had high hopes for this movie and Disney in general. What I'm seeing is a loss of quality in the brand. At this point I'm worried Disney will be ruining everything in the near future.

816,wingwong-15943,Really disappointed,2,7 September 2020,I was really disappointed with the way this story was portrayed. All of the important build-ups were anti-climatic. The original story (both animated and the historical story itself) was full of drama and this movie fell short of that. The part where she cut off her hair and revealed her true identity were such big parts of the original story and it was glossed over. I wasn't emotionally connected to the characters. The fantasy element of the phoenix seemed random and forced. The ending was again anti-climatic. The acting was overly dramatic as if they were dubbing English over a foreign film. My boyfriend has never even seen the animated version and he thought it was bad.,Mulan

The problem is that the movie lacks SOUL! The cast is doing a fine job but something is missing! I don't mind the changes they made to the original. I mind that certain thing that made an impact in the original are absent in the new one, to name a few:MULANS DECISION TO LEAVE HOME
THE EMPEROR AND CHINA BOWING TO MULAN AT THE END
THE CLIMBING OF THE POLE TO REACH THE ARROW DURING TRAININGALL OF THOSE SCENES ARE EITHER ABSENT OR THEY PASS SO FAST YOU MISS THEM

Theme words such as ""honor"" and ""duty"" are used exponentially more times in the script than the movie itself ever tries to convey as actual themes. Mulan, a character that is supposed to challenge stereotypical gender roles and duties through wit and and a clear sense of right and wrong is dumbed down to an emotionless Kung-Fu wielding field warrior.At one point, she deflects a spear being thrown at her by kicking it...while riding a horse. She proceeds to jump into the air, kick the spear back down toward the attacker that threw it, does a backflip, and lands back on the horse....and Mushu was too unrealistic? Yikes Disney. Just yikes.",Mulan
821,caedon-29136,They removed all good parts and things about the movie,2,5 February 2021,"It's like they took everything great about the movie and threw it out. They didn't want to offend the Chinese with the tiny dragon spirit so instead they offended them even more with a eagle witch lady and giving Mulan super human abilities. Not only did they remove almost all character development for the characters but they also made the supporting characters so bland and similar I had trouble remembering who was who. This movie was also supposed to be about female empowerment which I was excited for, since the original also did a great job with that. However it seems like they removed a lot of the meaningful empowerment from the original movie. In the original Mulan tries to do tasks like the men around her, like climbing the pole, but she soon realizes that she doesn't need to become a man and can use her brains instead of her brawn. The new movie takes an entirely different approach and instead gives her super human like abilities costing not only the female empowerment but a valuable lesson and character building experience for Mulan. Also at the end of the film the emperor visibly struggles with his lines as he invites Mulan to be his bodyguard, whereas in the original the emperor gives Mulan the highest possible honor or bowing to her. Like a large number of recent Disney movies Mulan seems half-assed, with any plot holes filled with convenient saviors and random magic for no reason. None of the characters were all that interesting and the acting wasn't great except for Mulan and her father.",Mulan

The musical numbers in Mulan were some of the best music out there; they could have at least had many of the songs in this film in instrumental form; but nope!

How did they screw this up so badly? Filled with boring monologue and action scenes and with non sensical SJW rhetoric throughout, this was doomed from the written script.

And Mulan as a character is inspiring. We know that because of how beloved the original animated film was. A young woman throws off societal norms in order to protect her father from (most likely) dying in battle. You can't mess that up, right?Wrong, clearly. I can't say for sure whether or not Yifei Liu is a good actress. Maybe it was the director being passive, or maybe the dull script just didn't let her channel any kind of energy. Whatever the reason, the result is that Mulan is a hollow and cold character void of any real emotion. It is not a smart strategy to have your lead character have a lack of emotion. After all...well, THEY ARE THE MAIN CHARACTER!Mulan herself aside, the dialogue was clunky and the supporting cast equally bland. Mulan's deep connection to her family is unconvincing, characters are robotic, none of the ""inspiring"" scenes are inspirational, and the stakes are never really hit home.In the end, we are left with a hollow shell of a movie. A movie that could have been something, but turned out to be nothing.",Mulan

If you take notice of the complaints, most of them are about how little the live action movie is related to the animation. I watched the animated film when it came out and never watched it again. It didn't leave much of a mark. Maybe that's why I enjoyed this one so much. It should be perceived as a stand alone movie. Forget about the cartoon!

First of all: I actually liked it better than most Disney live action redo's. I'm not here to just see a literal copy of the animated movie. I really enjoyed it and it made me emotional at times. Also, the visuals are just absolutely stunning. Those colors, the landscapes and sky... Just, wow! I think the story as presented in this movie is beautiful. I'm not Chinese, so I'm not sure how true to Chinese history, tradition and lore this is, so I can't base my opinion on that.

A random Disney Fan who grew up on the Golden Era of Disney could have put together a more faithful screenplay. The Whale Rider Director is Pretentious in the ""Vision"" they had for this Film in taking away the music and main characters for more ""Realism""
They could have had the best of both just like with what Golden Era Disney did already, and is Unprecedented for. Comedy, Unbelievable Action, Music that means so much to so many. Reflections was so iconic, and for people who didn't feel a connection to the person they see in the mirror is so relevant today. This movie could have been truly Empowering, but instead it's just ""Woke""
This movie decided to take everything away from what made Mulan what it was and didn't build on it at all either. Took away the Heart & Soul of what makes Disney special. Please don't ruin the Hercules remake like this Russo bros! Take note of the reviews. This is not what we want.

Her struggle to become accepted by her peers and captain was clear, it made her achievement believable and joyful.However, in the remake this doesn't happen, there is no struggle for Mulan, she already knows she is the best warrior, the only struggle is her deception at not showing it and this for me was a mistake by Disney.",Mulan

840,rachvt15,It's a yes from me,10,19 June 2021,"I don't want to watch a musical and I'm glad this script differs from the animated version, otherwise I'd be so bored.. Now I think it's a beautifully-shot movie and the lead characters are all very endearing. The set is gorgeous and magnificent and the ancestor-worship is true (I grew up in southeast Asia in a Cantonese-speaking family and I watched my family take seriously the praying to ancestors at the altar daily). About the phoenix in the movie, yeah it's not something I've seen done with regards to ancestor worship in my circles, but the phoenix is a highly-regarded mystical creature of good in the old, old days, and I thought it was a nice touch to add some mysticism to the story. I love Gong Li in the show, but didn't like how seemingly easily she died before the ending bit... Wish she had lived. But apart from that, I loved every bit of the show. People criticising the makeup... Well I believe this movie is set in Tang dynasty, which explains the style of dress and makeup - you can Google Tang dynasty makeup and see. This isn't technically inaccurate as Mulan is a traditional story that dates as far back as the Tang dynasty, and the Tang dynasty was very powerful at the time. Even the Japanese and Koreans emulated their fashion styles and incorporated its ideas into their traditional costumes like the kimono and hanbok. In short, the movie never set out to be some sort of totally historically accurate affair. The magical parts added to it gives it an allure which appeals to those who appreciate magical aspects. I also like that every character in the show is played by people of Asian ethnicity. At least it wasn't that whitewashed by Hollywood. It's a 10/10 for me and my two teenage kids enjoyed watching the movie with me, and were delighted when they saw that Ip Man was part of the show.",Mulan

The original has a lot of heart and character development and this version has neither. It gives you no reason to care about Mulan, she's just naturally an amazing warrior who needs little training (because these days female Disney characters have to just be perfect at everything.) This movie was made to satisfy no one and Disney is in desperate need of better leadership.",Mulan
842,DrVankman,"The movie production and visual part - 10, story and script - 2",4,11 September 2020,"The most correct decision made by the authors of the new reading of the poem about Hua Mulan is an attempt to abstract from the original 1998 cartoon. While the modern version of Mulan still adheres to Walt Disney's framework for how directors and screenwriters need to work with familiar stories of classic animation, the film still has an ambition to be a project in its own right.
In general, if we talk about the cast of the film, it's quite excellent.
But despite such a successful casting decision, Mulan's story cannot be believed. The script of the film is a uniform mess, rushing at full speed into unknown direction. It feels like the authors were in a hurry to show everything to their viewer as soon as possible, fearing to miss his attention even for a second. But if the viewer really had something to miss, there would be no questions. The truth is no need to watch this film in order to know what and how it works.
Yes, the studio didn't need to invent a new Chinese poem. But the film clearly had the ambition to be something epic on a grand scale in the best traditions of Akira Kurosawa, the master of samurai epics.
Let's look at the situation from the point of view of movie makers. We have a certain trend in Hollywood cinema that has been popular in recent years and we want to adjust the good old story familiar to the audience for it. Let's transform a solid, but old-fashioned, musical cartoon into something serious, without songs and culture, straightforward and epic, filled with bright colors and aimed at the modern viewer. Here I immediately have a question: Would you like to take the material seriously then? No, it is better to sit on two chairs: try to buy the viewer with colorful, fabulous shots that look crooked, and at the same time bring to the fore the morality loved by Dominic Toretto - ""Family is the main thing"". And then, having calmed down the absurd battle scenes and letting out an artificial tear over a difficult fate, say: ""Yes, we made a movie with meaning."" It turned out poorly. If you remember the original, which could both make fun and give a simple moral at the end, then there is also a clear construction of scenes and dialogues, which is simply not there in the 2020 remake. Here is a collection of quotes, standard images and abstract beautiful backgrounds. $200 million have gone nowhere. The whole film is saturated with artificiality, and the script only makes it worse in this case.
Very difficult to find something positive about Mulan (2020). Disney doesn't try to put out good and interesting adaptations at all. Nobody says that the film should be exactly the same as it's predecessors. But the viewer should be interested. In fact, the graphics, production of the film and the visual part of it are beautiful, but it's not enough to decorate a fairy tale, you need to be able to present it with a good story and script.
As a result, film production and visual part - 10, story and script - 2.",Mulan

Story was excellent, acting was very impressive and the action scenes were superb. I understand those who compared it to the original cartoon and were disappointed, I have done that with other movies ( Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory for example) but I give this action flick 8 stars, thoroughly enjoyed it and would definitely watch it again.

Unfortunately, she must bury her gifts and marry a suitable match in order to bring honour to her family. Northern invaders, called Rourans, march towards the Imperial City, led by Bori Kahn and a powerful witch alongside him. The emperor orders that each family provides a male warrior to fight for the kingdom. Mulan is forced to take the place of her frail father who is the only male in her family.As I do for all adapted films, I will not compare Mulan (2020) with the original animation and I will judge the film on its own right.The first act of the film was an eye-friendly watch that showed us the journey of Mulan from a child discovering her abilities to a teenager struggling with her identity and her place in society. Training in a camp of males, she must do all it takes to hide her true identity as a female and abide by the three virtues of a warrior (loyalty, bravery, and honesty). While all of these sound like solid points, the movie invested an unnecessary amount of time in achieving these, while occasionally being repetitive with its messages.Things quickly turn sour in the second act as the battle emerges. In a weird instance of solely chasing a small army of Northern Invaders, Mulan is lured into isolation with Bori Kahn's witch. Mulan establishes a connection with the witch who encourages her to come to terms with her true identity and abilities. As Mulan embraces her true self, the movie suddenly seems to run out of time as she is shown, in fast pace, to save the Imperial army and eventually the emperor in an extraordinary but cheesy fashion.Mulan (2020) is a visually stunning film for the most part, but it struggles to be anything more than ordinary as it fails to invest in providing compelling action sequences to cement its over-established plot points.5/10.",Mulan

Look no further than the fact that it's nigh impossible to remember the names of any character outside of Mulan herself (and Cricket, for obvious reasons).The sorceress carried this movie as far as she could, but ultimately it was shot like a mid-90's martial arts movie, with little comedy and a cgi Phoenix, and that wasn't nearly enough to get the job done.",Mulan

If you're expecting ""I'll make a man out of you"", you won't hear it. I felt no spark with any character including Mulan herself, it's possibly because of the wooden acting and forced dialogue. She is extra powerful despite not learning any stunts because of this ""chi"" nonsense.The best thing I can say about this movie, is that it has some cool action sequences and cinematography but that's pretty much it. The end credits has a decent song.I'm getting quite exhausted with these Disney remakes and the senseless cash grab despite Disney being filthy rich.

863,PoliSci21,Just disappointing...,1,14 September 2020,"The 1998 Mula film has always been one of my favorite films, not just because it made me feel represented as a young Asian-American but the film had a good story with important messages. Not going to lie, I was both excited and scared about the 2020 film but I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt.Now I know the 1998 film has some flaws but the 2020 does just adds nothing. I really mean, nothing. The CGI looks questionable at times, the phoenix was confusing and useless but its most disappointing qualities are that of its changes to the characters and the plotline. For instance, the decision made to make Mulan a prodigy invalidates just about what made her stick as a character in my mind. She was proof that it was possible to become good at something so as long as you persevered. In the 1998 film, Mulan is offered a role as an advisor but in the 2020 film she gets an offer to be a guard. In the age of Disney trying to be relevant and/or woke, this comes off as insulting. There's really no good that comes out of preformative feminism which doesn't work to benefit all women. Instead it pits women against other women. Even the 2020 Mulan was at times innovative and in return, you give her a job that allows for her to not input any of her useful insight? How is that fair and why did Disney think it worked from a story perspective. What made the 1998 Mulan tick was that it explored the extreme ends of preforming masculinity (she was super awkward when she first met Li Shang) and femininity (I mean the matchmaker scenes were just perfect) and she failed at both. Instead she demonstrated that it's important to harness the qualities of both genders and that she only succeeded when she used both.Finally, I'm going to dock points a point for historical accuracy because while this was never marketed as some sort of historical epic and it's a Disney film, the thing with costuming, art direction and set design, is that it has to add to the story. I mean Moulin Rouge's costumes aren't really historically appropriate but they add to the feeling of what a spectacle Moulin Rouge is. For example, one could look to the type of house that Mulan's family lived in. As the story is set in Central China, the round houses were characteristic of those in the southwestern part of the country. I'm sure the shape of the houses aren't really relevant to the plot but it wouldn't hurt to change that aspect especially if you're not constricted by the confines of animation. To be frank, I find it insulting that Disney has all the money and couldn't hire a single (or better, several) East Asian Studies/literature professor to help them with that?I can't speak to how accurate the script was as I'm not terribly knowledgable about the original ballad and as such, I can't dock a whole lot of points for that. Perhaps it wasn't the worst film I've ever seen due to technicalities, but it it earned itself a one-star rating for its lack of innovation given its resources.",Mulan

871,diversecleaning,"Not terrible, but really not worth watching",3,10 September 2020,"To say the movie was mildly entertaining is to be very gracious. I have certainly watched movies that were far worse but for a major blockbuster I truly expected more.This movie kept the plotline similar to the original but cut all of the heart, the comedy and the songs that made the cartoon magical.Why would you cut Mushu (the best part of the cartoon) but then have a witch who can transform into an eagle? Either make this a believable/realistic reimagining of the story or keep the fantasy with the best characters from the original.The casting was actually pretty poor as well, as why spend the money to cast Jet Li when he is barely recognizable and did almost no martial arts. Jason Scott Lee looked terrible and was not very believable as an intimidating villan, I thought I was looking at an overweight Jack Sparrow everytime I saw him.The most egregious of errors though was cutting the songs that made the cartoon magical from this version. Sure they made nods to the songs but it was a major error in my opinion to leave them out.Lastly the story felt rushed, like they were trying to fit it in a tight time window and left half the scenes they filmed out as I did not feel that the recruits going from loveable losers to a lethal fighting force was given enough time which caused the entire ending to feel rushed and forced. In the cartoon I loved and could see the transformation and felt moved, in this version I felt cheated especially without the songs to accompany the training.Again this was not horrible but I will never watch this version ever again. I had to put the cartoon version on immediately after finishing this one to make sure that my opinion of the cartoon still held as I had not watched it in many years and it just reinforced my opinion that this version is far far far inferior and need not exist.",Mulan
872,mrajithfernando,Nostalgia Cash Grab 101,6,8 September 2020,"How not to review is giving it a 10/10 and just asking the people to ""watch and enjoy"".They used the name Mulan to remind us what this movie is supposed to be, but it never is. It has all the classic elements of martial art movies like Crouching tiger hidden dragon, house of flying daggers, hero... Minus the effort put into the plot. Okay, this is supposed to be a ""live action remake"" of a classic.
They couldn't put a dragon but they include a witch who shape shifts. But that's not even the problem.If this was an average action adventure movie with top asian stars and martial arts, it's an okay movie. But this is called Mulan. And there is no respect shown towards the legend of the warrior Mulan and the original animated movie which will be the reason that someone is spending money to watch this on tv.
There's zero character development for most characters, even the warrior who grows through hardship into the final form is not shown, it's just using the chi which was always there since her childhood. The witch basically has no critical application towards the turning point.This isn't a bad movie. It's enjoyable. But it's not Mulan. I'm not even comparing the two otherwise this would get something like 4/10...this is a basic action adventure movie with names like Jet Li, Donnie Yen, Crystal Liu and a basic plot, scenes which are added for visual treats and the warrior lady saves the day (which they did a decent ending and she did it humbly without uttering any cringy lines. But unfortunately, not empowering as the original but better than Captain Marvel of course!)... Grab some popcorn. Okay movie. Not worth the price though.",Mulan

But i was surprised that It was really entertaining .I never felt that i am bored . I didn't feel with the time. The writers of mulan are the same writers who wrote Jurassic World and The rise of the planet of the apes. The main character mulan who was played by Yifei lu was acceptable . But the movie didn't have songs of the original animation. The fight battles were good in some places and bad in other . Finally it was an incredible experience during the corona virus Thanks.,Mulan
874,mojo-72784,It's Mulan,8,7 September 2020,"Like most people I've been anxiously anticipating this movie for months. I came in with no expectations other than hearing there was no Mushu and no musical numbers. Instead of remaking the animated film into a live action movie Disney chose to reimagine the story of Mulan.
I see a lot of complaints from unhappy folks who wanted a remake not a reimagining. If that's what you're expecting, skip this version and pop on the cartoon.
This reimagining is not fast paced. Far more methodical and pretty much all drama with little comic relief. Reminded me more of watching old war movies, which is pretty spot on for Mulan-a film about a female warrior. I am fine with the change in love interest, far more practical to find love with an equal instead of a commanding officer. The action sequences are more in line with Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, etc. Aligned with Chinese cinema so that makes sense too.
I've read a lot of complaints about characters not getting much development through the movie-reminder this is called Mulan. Hint hint, wink wink-it is about her development. So again made sense while I was watching.
Favorites: the scenery. Breath taking, beautiful landscapes.
Less favorite-as a war story about Mulan there is no way I'd let my young nieces and nephews watch this. There's a reason it's PG-13. Not for young kids, they can keep watching the lovable, funny cartoon. Also the Phoenix seemed very unnecessary. Without it the plot would have still been quite a full circle story.",Mulan

876,sunshine-35536,Okay as a stand-alone movie,4,12 September 2020,"Honestly, I would not have watched this movie had it not been titled ""Mulan"". I was expecting the same feeling of feminism and women's empowerment as I felt when I watched the original animated version. However, I was sorely disappointed. I wanted to get up and leave in the first 10 minutes itself and I would have, had I not come with friends.
It was devoid of a lot of the main characters that stood out for me in the original movie. They left out all the catchy meaningful songs. In addition, some of the scenes were so cliche that they left me feeling very uncomfortable. The whole movie seemed to have a very serious tone, unlike the animated one.
The movie lacks the depth and symbolism that the animated movie had, which made the original Mulan one of my favourite movies of all time. I do not think that the people who made this movie really understood why the original story was so meaningful to a lot of people.
There are a few nice things though about this movie. I did like the presence of the emperor and Böri Khan, the fearsome warrior, and I absolutely adored the scenery.
Since it was called ""Mulan"", I expected it to resemble to original movie in more ways and, because of this, I was disappointed. Had the movie not been named ""Mulan"", I might not have watched it. However, had it been called something other that ""Mulan"", I might have given it a higher rating.",Mulan

878,christaphor,Six Star Experience,6,4 September 2020,"Got to say really liked the creativity of this movie I thought they had no chance replacing the animated style with something watchable but they pulled it off. The ending was spoilt to me by a group of so called ""rebels"" who thought it was funny to pull a fast one on an old timer. Not that I had anything against them - I've accidentally spoiled endings to movies before (even on the night of my WEDDINGS DOH!).The use of colour was fantastic and I was really sold on the female to male transformation as it looked passable as a cool dude I'd grab a beer with. But not in China. The wars would have been far too distracting to possibly enjoy some thousand year old Chinese brew. I really liked the scene where she climbed up the pole, showing off how she could do it and nobody else could. I was reminded of my high school days of climbing a rope, jumping jacks and a 15-20 minute cooldown depending on how hard I push myself, which is usually to the max.Although I do have to take some points off, the screen wasn't nearly as big as the last Disney remake that I watched. Thanks to my daughter, the 65"" flatscreen in the garage was smashed from when SOMEBODY threw a house party without my knowledge. SOMEBODY knows that it was very wrong, and quite frankly has ruined 90-100% of my free time (WATCHING TV). Thanks to that SOMEBODY who I promised the wife would remain nameless, I had to watch Mulan on the 52"" in the family room. This of course (as anyone with a family knows) was a complete disaster. There was simply no time to get fully immersed in this classic movie.Furthermore I had noticed a few mistakes in the chorography which meant I was briefly removed from the moment. I know it's hard not to set a foot out of line, especially being on the set for such a long amount of time, but when you pay upwards of £30 to view in the first place you expect the best. I'm sure any fellow mapping enthusiasts are aware of the issue, so I won't be explaining any more (GOOGLE!).Overall I liked the movie and I think it kept a lot of the originaly magic Disney had already created all those years ago (my god, where does the time go), I think that there were some serious improvments to be made when it comes to the chorography, and I have to add that the actors (WHOM I RESPECT GREATLY) didn't bring anything new to the characters as I expect they had been directed to.To conclude I deem this to be a six out of ten. Glad to zone out for a while, but while the TV is being repaired had to squint a bit after my daughter only went and broke the bloody thing.",Mulan

Li Gong did a fine job but it was for me the witch just did not fit. Yifei Liu did a good job as Mulan i found her believable and a fine actress, how they found out about her being mulan was again better and more cool in the cartoon. i very much liked Yoson An as Honghui but his story was so much better in the cartoon and the story between Mulan and Li Shang made that story so much better so changing out Li Shang for Honghui was a mistake. think Yoson would have done a very good job as Li Shang and Jason Scott Lee was just bad as Böri Khan and changing the story from Shan Yu again a mistake for me. simply a better character so i dont blame JSL for the acting i think thats more the character and direction then the actingso to end my rantCartoon in every way better

Because this is a bit more mature than Disney's animation, we also have another character played by Gong Li who seems to represent the more traditional way women in ancient history were able to maintain power. Gong Li has been cast in similar hypnotically tragic roles in Memoirs of a Geisha and Raise the Red Lantern. Ming-Na Wen, who voiced the animated Mulan has a cool cameo! And of course it was also great fun to see martial arts action stars Donnie Yen, Jet Li and Jason Scott Lee. No Eddie Murphy though.

900,hayjohn,I enjoyed it,9,1 November 2020,"Very good film, yes it's like watching a different film to the cartoon version, but it's still very good in its own right.

901,alexthomas-yk,Could've been Disney's Wonder Woman,6,5 September 2020,"It's a Disney movie. As expected you'll get a family friendly movie, minus the songs. There are no songs in this movie. Story of Mulan is well known. While bringing a live action adaptation of an iconic character, the main focus should've been to stay true to original. Movie is half an hour longer than the original, which made the movie kind of slow and bought nothing new. An important character who made the animated movie fun is missing, instead you can see a phoenix. There are some good moments but most of the movie are forgettable. There are two Antagonist, both lifeless and forgettable. No showdown in the End. What's funny is the person who can shift shape and bring terror to anyone had a change of heart from a 2 min speech. The one who captured all the outposts without much effort fails against a girl, who have not even finished the training!There is very little action. Final showdown I disappointing. May be they did not get enough time to do more set pieces. Directing is average not exceptional. Additional effects made the movie watchable. Lot of wirework which is not integrated properly and sometimes the giant leaps look weird/ funny.Cinematography is amazing at parts. Especially in the beginning. Some of the CGI are amazingly blended and some are clearly noticeable. Still, with weak direction, it's the cinematography that makes this movie watchable. Set design is okay, there are no scenes where set looks dirty or like people have been living there for long. Incredibly clean and looks like a drama set with a lot of clolors. It sure does make the movie look good but there is no originality considering peoples have been living there for generations and the place looks incredibly clean like it was painted yesterday. No cobwebs, no dust, no dirt. In every scene soldier's armor is clean. Even in the training scenes or after a fight, may be they had anti dust coating, I don't know. There are few short action scenes with less blood even after stabbing and getting mutilated. May be they wanted to keep the movie family friendly. The whole movie is filled with clean sets and costumes!!!!!!For me Music is an important factor while watching movies. Compared to other Disney movies, bit underwhelming but manageable. No songs!! Even the End credit song was average.Yifei Liu as Mulan gave an incredible performance. Rest of the supporting cast performed well but none of them are memorable due to weak screenplay. Li Gong and Jason Scott Lee as Antagonists looked menacing in the beginning since they had a strong introduction. But was handled poorly and in the end they were both forgettable. That I'd say is due to script since the whole focus was on Mulan alone. Jet Li as emperor even though for a short period and Cast of Mulan's entire Family was good. In fact they're the only characters that'll stay with you after the movie. Donnie Yen had few good lines and less action scenes.Overall, what I can say is Mulan is very much like the original, but lengthy and dragging without any memorable scenes. Is it worth the 30$? Strong NO. But, filled with beautiful colors and with Yifei's incredible performance as Mulan, worth a watch. With a beautiful and talented actress to play as Mulan, this could've been Disney's Wonder Woman.",Mulan

903,timothyisathome,Can't believe the hate and vitrial,8,11 November 2020,"I'm old and don't generally like any remakes. Aladdin was horrible, Ghost busters was an abomination.This was very good and I have watched it several times.Using the original music numbers and incorporating it into the sound track was brilliant. There are the original characters and some new ones that are well incorporated into the story.unlike the original this is aimed at a higher age group. It's incorporated some of the classics of Chinese film making and of course Disney film making to make a nice hybrid.Something new, because it's a live action movie, it has more a relationship between audience and characters, they do a good job pulling at hearth strings, making you laugh and making you really dislike the bad guy, all good things from this film enthusiast's perspective.people who expect a cheesy easy spit out of the original were never going to like this movie and since people today love to hate we all knew it would happen.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and will watch it again",Mulan

905,gielschelfhout,Fake and without feeling,4,14 December 2020,"I'm usually a big fan of the live action adaptations Disney does but this one is utter garbage.First off many of the fighting sequences, if not all, are extremely fake. Even at the start of the movie, Viewing the first chase scene, I said aloud ""this is fake.

908,michael-gernert,"Some good acting, still worst Disney film",1,23 September 2020,"Disney must have known how this was going to play out, at least since the very much deserved backlash against the lead actress. The core acting itself is actually good for the most part, however, calling this film Mulan while neither staying true to the animated classic (which I haven't seen nor feel the need to) nor to any pre-Nationalist versions shows a blatant disregard for historical accuracy and signals a total submission to CCP censorship. All the more enjoyable it was to see that their pandering to China and the Wu Mao in particular didn't work out, hence the steep price you have to pay to see this film.",Mulan

No songs, no cricket and yes no Mushu. So knowing this info has been about for two years. Why are people upset and acting shocked at these changes.As far as me and my family. This is up there with Aladdin in the live action cattagory. Really enjoyed it. Beautifuly made, well acted and loved the lil nods to the original but at the same time admired and liked the fact it was its own movie.My 8 year old lil girl loved it. There doesn't need to be a princess, a cute song or a love interest not when you have a strong female lead character as good as this. Well done Disney",Mulan

913,mojarradali-21785,Disgusting attempt at a remake,1,7 September 2020,"Story is about a Chinese warrior
it is based in China
so it is only the minimum expectation to want the movie to respect these facts.Jet li's voice as the Emperor is dubbed which is complete disrespect to a well established actor possibly so that the Emperor of China can speak English without an accent!Lets forget there are casts that are from other countries in Asia to portray chinese warriors. I personally find it insulting when movie makers do this.Story's pace is like watching turtles in a marathon run. It starts good and then goes on a never ending tale of building up the story and then the actual interesting parts take maybe less than 20% of the movie. I easily got disconnected multiple times during the movie because of this.Somehow it felt like the movie's attempt to touch on traditions and martial arts aspect of the story was very cliche and from the perspective of someone without any proper knowledge who is only aware of the words not the meaning behind them.The actors were good and it was great to see so many old school actors joining together in a movie but the choices made for the story's pace and direction ruined it all.Next time, dont ever consider dubbing Jet li and bring on a director with cultural and martial art background to at least act as an assistant.It is a shame that a cartoon made 20+ years ago with less budget and technology is still 100x times better than a movie with far bigger budgets and more well known actors.",Mulan
914,prsetiadi,Very entertaining and good,10,5 December 2020,"First of all, this is why I never trust rating in IMDB for movies. Really. Especially for good movies. Many people rate it with unreasonable hates. Yes you read it right, hates. Ratings should be based on some important elements in the movie itselves, like cinematography, acting, storyline, twist, etc., as long as it was relevant to the making of the movie. History or reality, sometimes are not relevant. Yes, it's not relevant. Remember marvel or dc comic movies? Or even stupid star wars movies? Yes you got it.And the most important thing is, this is a movie, not some youtube garbage videos of rants and prankings. That's what and why the movie was made for. So ratings should be considered valid only if it was writen by people who knows about movies.. or better, knows about how to make movies. This Mulan movie is just so much underrated. That's it.",Mulan

916,matthewmvpbilodeau,"Disappointing compared to the animated classic, but okay on its own",6,31 December 2020,"I went into this movie with some low expectations because of the many poor reviews I had heard. I was not expecting this to be good. Unfortunately, I was mostly correct.First of all, as you have seen in the trailers, there is no dragon or cricket in this movie. Instead, there is a Witch and a phoenix, both of which are seen in the trailers so not a spoiler. This immediately lowered my expectations for this movie and took away my favorite aspect of the animated classic, Mushu. I understand that they were apparently trying to go with a more realistic approach, but including a Witch and a phoenix does not sit well with me and sadly, neither really worked for me.One of the best things about Disney classics are the often beautiful soundtracks and memorable lyrics. There is absolutely none of the original music from the animated Mulan. This was a huge missed opportunity in my opinion. The sound tracks they did include were very mellow and not all that good.Additionally, there are not a lot of enjoyable things about this. The action looks very staged and fake, the characters for the most part are not likable like the original, and the story, although very similar, is much weaker because they included the Witch, which did nothing positive for this movie in my eyes.The only good things about this movie are the visuals, the culture, and the acting. The visuals overall are nice and except for two occasions, they were splendid. The cultural aspect was very nice to see, reminded me of Black Panther a little bit and worked very well. And the acting was pretty good. Although none of the characters are very memorable or special like the original, the acting itself was done well for the most part and I did enjoy that. Also, Liu Yifei did a good job as Mulan.Overall, this was not a terrible movie, but far from being a good one. The story is familiar and there are a few likable aspects like I mentioned but for me, the negative parts really stood out too much for me to be able to rate it any higher than a 6. This movie lacked good, believable action and most importantly, it lacked emotion. I really did not feel any emotion watching this movie. When Mulan cried in the movie, it looked like someone pouring water on her face. Just very poorly done. Like I said, Mulan herself is a good character for the most part and the actress did good given her limitations, but overall this movie is not too similar to the animated classic and this will anger many Mulan fans, including myself. But taking away all the comparisons to the original, this is an okay standalone movie. But I would not go see a sequel.",Mulan

If that's what you're looking for, check out movies from TIFF, Sundance, etcThis movie is a live action of heroine our daughters loved, and the female director (love this fact alone!) took the opportunity to expand and modernize this heroine to heights she deserved - in my opinion, she knocked it out of the park.My girls are now 15 and 18 and they loved this version - what more can Disney ask for????

I was really looking forward to see it. I never compared it to the anime and hoped to see good action movie with interesting characters, character development and cool martial arts scenes.What did I get:1. The main characters are boring and the development of Mulan herself didn't cached me, too. During the whole plot I couldn't sympathise with one of the main characters. The best and most interesting character was the witch. If they had made a movie about her it could be really good.2. The fight scenes are looking fine but I never believed them or took away in the movie land. I know that none of them are realistic, but if I saw Ip Man I was fascinated but the fast pace and perfect movement of Donnie Yen but the Mulan actress couldn't bring me to this point. Furthermore, the scene with the Trebuchet was actual braking the last bit of immersion in little bit pieces. Yes, it's a devastating weapon but slow and not really accurate. In this movie this damn thing hitting its targets accurate and fast like a modern tank with a laser guidance system.3. You, can recognize the green screen scenes. They looks artificial and so the remaining pieces of any kind of immersion are vaporized and vanishing in the fating nebular.4. End titles. Wow, they are really looking good and raises more emotions than the whole rest of the movie.Conclusion: I watched the movie to the end and I dind't skipped scenes. So we are going to a >=3 stars.

The story was good and there were small sparks in the acting but none of it never really meshed. Backgrounds and scenery fit in well and it gave me an understanding of Chinese traditions but as for entertainment I am very happy I watched this at a relatives home. I would have been really upset paying 30 dollars to watch this on top of the annual cost if Disney+. But in the end, the stunts were over the top and unrealistic.

Villan is under a different name, her friend and potential love interest is just a random guy she meets in army. There are absolutely no songs at all in the movie which doesn't feel like Disney. The only good bits in the movie were lead actress, scenery, costumes and choreography. Mulan deserves another remake by a competent director who would bring his own creativity and imagination while staying true to the original Disney iteration of Mulan. But so far this is the worst Disney live action film I've ever seen.",Mulan
942,slone-59258,"Was just ""eh""",2,6 September 2020,"Majority of watchers already know how the story goes. I felt something was just really missing throughout the entire movie. The lack of the soundtrack that made the original animation version so touching was a miss for sure. The Witch character by Gong Li was completely pointless. And I feel (like others have mentioned) that deeper character arcs were just really absent from the movie. We don't get to see Mulan's inner turmoil in taking her father's place, we don't see the realization from her father once he realizes the sacrifice his daughter made. The iconic hair-cutting scene was absent too. Early press interviews indictated that Mushu's absence was due to wanting Mulan's camaraderie with her fellow men to be the focus but I saw zero depth between her and the men; the only thing we get in the obvious attraction from Honghui, which was a lame replacement for the animated version's Shang Li. The final battle scene was so Hollywood and made me roll my eyes. Mulan's efforts in saving the entire palace of people was also incredibly underscored in this version. Just very anticlimactic. And random, and I don't know if this was on purpose or not, but Yifei Liu looked half asleep in nearly all the scenes of her out in the desert on the horse. She looked really tired. And I love how once she decides to be ""true"" to herself...she lets her hair down and returns to the battle field with a super-clean face that's considerably paler than how she appeared for the first half of the entire movie. Come on....I will say the set visuals overall were nice, but I've watched enough Chinese period dramas to know how massive and to-scale Hengdian Studios is with Chinese palaces and forts. So maybe impressive to others, but not super surprising to me. This movie reminded me a lot of the live-action ""Aladdin"" remake -- great visuals, but something is just missing story-wise. Many things cut from the animated version just take away from the belief of the live-action version.That all being said, I still think it was great for Disney to give Asian faces and Asian stars a chance to shine and represent a folktale known by generations.I'd say watch this if you're curious, but if you don't -- you're honestly not missing out on anything.",Mulan

It's a story of its own and has a beautiful theme throughout.Now, comes the 2020 live-action release and it did not disappoint. The characters were beautiful portrayed, even with the changes from the '98 version.Fans may be mad because there isn't any musical songs throughout, and I get that, but they've done it well with the stunning instrumental pieces that appear in the background, that resonate the songs we know and love.You won't be disappointed though, as Christina comes back and outdoes herself with a fresher rendition of Reflection, and the new song Loyal, Brave, True in the credits.There are so many differences to the original, and so many things they kept the same. It was a great addition for the movie and it kept you thinking as you already know the story, but not the fine tuning and added action that was coming!I think this movie was very tastefully done and compliments the '98 version nicely.

Mulan however manages to be both true to the original and make itself a movie of it's own. Look, nobody needs to see Mulan done exactly like it was before (just see that movie instead, it's a great one). This new version does not need to have musical numbers or Eddie Murphy's fast talk. What it needs is to stand on it's own - and it does exactly that. Yifei Liu is a fantastic Mulan and Jason Scott Lee as Böri Khan is just as menacing as Shan Yu in the animation.

Then through half of the film , nothing much happening but still watchable so I thought ok, I give it 6/10 perhaps. But then , after half of the film, really becoming unwatchable!! When the movie finished I can only give it 4!!! The only good thing is the fighting scene. And the rest of the scenes is like only a few takes then director said, ok, that'll do! With no tension at all! Totally not serious at all with each scene. Because there is lack of character development in the first half of the film and she didn't gone thru much at all in the first half of the film, so there wasn't any tension builded up and so once she decided to show her true self, which supposed to make you feel excited and emotional , make you feel empty instead. Cause you can't connect yourself to the story. Then you becoming don't care anything anymore for the rest of film.

Using wits, determination and artifices she saves the emperor.
At least that was the original tale. Who would have thought that a post ""me too"" movie made by a woman would loose its soul and deliver the message that a woman needs super powers to be the hero of this story.That is the most disappointing aspect but then not the only one. Acting and scripts are cheasy as possible, special effects and fights worst than a 1970s wuxia movie and instead of laughing with the movie we are laughing at it.
The stupidest scene of the movie is when mulan closes the gate of the palace walls, while about all warriors in the movie can walk on the walls ! That's just one of many inconsistancies and aberrations of this parody.

So my review is based on a comparison between the cartoon Mulan movie and the Chinese live action MulanIf you liked the Disney cartoon of Mulan, you'll probably enjoy it. They even turned some of the song lyrics from the cartoon version into dialogue and rewrote some of the key combat sequences to make more sense in a live action movie. On the other hand, if you've seen the Chinese live action Mulan, then this will fall well short of the mark for you.They replaced the dragon with a bird which honestly, they could have done without. It's more complicated than just changing critters for kicks, but I'm trying not to give away the reason for using this particular bird... Thankfully, it was a very minor and limited plot device. Slightly more egregious though, is the addition of another unnecessary character to fulfil a similar role.The combat is VERY wuxian. So, if you liked the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or Dragon Blade fight sequences then you'll enjoy the fight scenes in Mulan. Lots of gravity defying FX and altogether unbelievable fighting techniques. But hey! It's a fantasy movie set in ancient China, so the action is standard fare.I do have to give it props for being a great movie for kids, especially girls. That whole inspirational, ""you can overcome everything life throws at you"" theme comes out better than in the cartoon. I actually added a star just for this.My issue with this film is that even though it's live action, it still feels like the cartoon version of Mulan. It lacks the gritty realism of the Chinese Mulan and the pace is sort pretty quick. My impression is that corners were cut with the plot because it is essentially a remake that most people know. Every familiar scene seems a bit clipped. Even the combat scenes are relatively brief for a live-action action film. Character development is minimal except for Mulan herself. You almost need to rewatch the cartoon movie so you can understand some of the important characters and sub-plots.As for the cast.... and what a cast! Excellent performances all around! I have to say that the casting department did a top notch job.I'm giving this version of Mulan 7 stars. The writing and directing is just too lazy to warrant more stars even in spite of the excellent acting and special effects. Since it is largely based on the cartoon movie there just isn't enough new content to oooh and aaah over. I also realize that many people reading this have never seen the Chinese version of Mulan. So, if my rating seems a little low, then my recommendation is to go find the better, grittier Chinese version for context.",Mulan

Then it was delayed from March 2020 to September 2020 due to COVID-19. I had very high hopes for the movie, especially after learning it was a new, PG-13 take on the story. The least of my expectations were a great reimagination of the mountain battle.
It was awful. Every single detail was changed to the worse, and I'm a fan of making changes in live-action remakes. Not a single character was interesting. The fight choreography was absolutely awful. The quality of the visual effects loudly says ""we don't think this will sell, but we're doing it anyway"".
Judging this movie as a standalone, it's bad, but comparing it to its predecessor makes it worse. Bori Khan is bland, but putting him as a replacement to Shan Yu is an insult. Xianniang the Witch is a badly-developed character that just almost becomes interesting.

What irks me about this remake is just how boring it is. If I was a kid watching this I would've fallen asleep. All the charisma and charm has been stripped and replace with sluggish dialogue and drawn out scenes. The biggest change that is baffling is to me is Mulan having super powers, which only isolates audience members because she is no longer relatable. In the animation she was clumsy but she was smart and determined, and the empowerment came from her transformation as a character from beginning to end.

992,Korimei,Disappointment at my childhood hero,3,10 September 2020,"The visuals are a 10/10 but the story and plot is just a disappointment, 3 at best. This is all my personal interpretation and I feel a lot will disagree with what I am going to say.What I like about the animated version of Mulan is her personality. The animated Mulan is someone who is witty, rebellious, misfit, but at the same time kind and loving daughter. In the beginning of the scene, she was writing down cheat notes on her hand and ending of the scene where all the other ladies were able to open their umbrella at the same time while Mulan had to watch them to know what to do. This scene related to me personally because I was that second grade student that was constantly behind in the class and struggle to to fit in. Mulan is kind of like me who is isn't like everyone else and struggle to fit in as bride/daughter while I struggle to fit in as a student. While in the action film the directors tried to use her sister as a comparison of how Mulan is different from other women but really fail because it just shows Mulan is different just due to her chi talent. It also doesn't really explain to me why Mulan is sad that she will get bride match make.
The next animated scene where Mulan stand up for her father and tried to reason with the guard was another powerful scene. I used to think Mulan was dumb for doing this but now I know this again reinforce her as someone who is misfit or daring of society because she think she is doing something right even though she is constantly told to know her place. It really build her character and why she would go to war for her father preparing to die. She went to war because she doesn't want her father to die and follows what she thinks is right. Whereas in the action film, Mulan was stopped by her relative and was like okay I wouldn't go. I believe even if the cartoon Mulan was stopped she will still make a scene and stand up for her father because cartoon Mulan cared more about family than reputation. The action film scene was a real disappointment because it just shows she is an obedient daughter she didn't challenge the norm. Even after she was yelled by her father she just stayed quiet and obedient. There is no dramatic scene when she decide to go to war and instead just cut to her already change in armor.
Mulan in the action felt like she is lost in her identity and needs a witch to tell him about her identity. Also, I didn't know what the phoenix was there for and later look it up to realize that was supposed to be a replacement of Mushu. Her bride make up was really ugly and make her look like a clown. I mean the court ladies make up look so much better and they could have just follow that.I felt that the action movie want a different approach of Mulan and in the end failed in execution. I feel like if they wanted to do an all mighty Mulan then it could be still done. Instead of saying she was talented because of chi they should say she was talented because she had a much bigger strength than everyone else. Instead of people calling her witch they should have the people pity Mulan's family for her wasted talent and felt that it's too bad Mulan's wasn't born as male. Mulan should play how she struggle with her strength and identify as a women and her struggle to balance both. She should have her dad help her send her to war knowing Mulan's talent in strength. Instead of him feeling regret in the movie for training his daughter. They should show her dad struggling with his own identifies by defying what's norm and letting his daughter go to war because it's the right thing for the family. They should have a scene where Mulan hides her strength because she doesn't want to get sent to the front line risking her chance of getting injured and die. Because if she gets injured or die they will find out she is a women. And they should have more scenes of her personal development with the male interest and why they like each other. Also I think the witch should be the one to reveal her identify instead of the action film where Mulan stupidly reveal herself and really brought dishonor to her family. The core message of the film should be whether she is a male or female she will stand up for what's right and be true to herself. Just like the animated cartoon,",Mulan

In my opinion it's a nicely shot, suspenseful story with a strong message. Watched it and I would do it again to be honest.I think it is getting a ton of hate because it's from a different culture with different values and instead of trying to understand other's actions, thoughts and motivations people rather hate, protest and boycott. Which sadly selldom leads to peace. That is also a point where I blieve the movie is lacking, the other side is just introduced as plain evil and the side of the protagonist is the talented and well meaning one, and it doesn't work like that in the real world.Also the movie was like ""fantasy"" with elements of magic, and that hurt the credibility of the protagonist a bit, because in hardships the magic was always there to help her so the plot could continue. So the writers were a bit lazy in motivating everything with logical events. But if you see it as a childs movie and pretend that you are a child (which you will have to, because a movie about war only showing blood once is cringe) then it's thoroughly enjoyable.This sounds ironic, but really.

996,Reelty,"Beautiful cinematography, bland lead",5,5 January 2021,"I really liked the idea of Disney making one of their live action adaptations with more of a focus on the original legend, and less of a carbon copy of the animated original, but this didn't work at all. The main issues are the story, which becomes really inconsistent, like the dangers of impersonating a male soldier are made to sound really drastic, but then she just walks off after a stern lecture. And the witch character is all over the place, motivation-wise. Some of the editing is really choppy and how they made a live action film with a budget like this less epic and grand as an animated film, I'll never know.
There is some beautiful cinematography tho, and the score is very good. Most of the cast do good work....except for the lead. She really only has 2 expressions; Surprised & Serious. Because her ""serious"" face is the same as her expressions for stoic, angry, inspiring, sad and worried. And, now that I think of it, that expression is sort of a lack of expression, like it's just her resting face. So really, just one expression. If you are replacing an animated character, which is the most expressive type of character you can have, you need an excellent actor with a lot of range.

The same mistakes again and again so feeble. I can't even say that there's no soul in it, because there's nothing alive at all. Firstly - a bad writing: there's no character development, the main heroine is just happened to be a superhero from the very beginning, I mean literally. The main antagonist is a laughing stock of a character, his final fight and death is just no comments. Ridiculous death of a secondary character without a reason or a storyline whatsoever. And a lot of other couldn't-care-less type of mistakes and decisions. Secondly - bad acting: like for real where, just tell me where they find such ""actresses"" as the main one in this film, was she even educated as such? Is it a joke or something, literally one straight face during all film, I am not pulling your leg here, maybe she has this super power that she is made of stone and can't show any emotions as in line with X men, then I admit her perfomance was smashing, she has surpassed Kristen Stewart in acting by far.

The movie was pretty boring actually and the effects were pretty bad, definitely not worth 30 dollars, glad I didn't pay to see it.

I think it was at least up to par with the other live action remakes. There was an extra character that had a very predictable storyline, and of course some elements were missing from the original, so yeah it wasn't a scene by scene remake. It was still a decent movie.

Just magic.Mishu is replaced by a phoenix. Such a useless substitution. If a dragon was kept, maybe. But it didn't contribute to the story.The movie uses songs from the original for background music. A blatant abuse to give a scene heart when it is devoid of any.The addition of the witch as the eagle is also pointless. Could have been more, but in it's current state it doesn't contribute at all.Lastly, the landscape and cinematography are the only things worth anything in this movie.

1009,mckennajd-22931,It was okay.,4,5 September 2020,"Niki Caro was not the right director for this film. She's known for dramatic fare but even still, the characters and their relationships were severely underdeveloped. When it came to action, Caro should have been wiser than to try to emulate a master such as Zhang Yimou. The obvious homage of Mulan's fight scenes to the superior Chinese director becomes very unflattering to Caro's take when comparison is made.The leads were mostly solid to serviceable, but Liu Yifei was perfectly cast. She needed to be the heart of this film and she really was. I had hoped she would be given an opportunity to show a little more range though. Jason Scott Lee was given too little to do as well, a sad continuation of a theme throughout his career.Some of the scenery was wonderful but again Caro made odd choices, keeping the final climactic set piece small-scale. The scope of the cinematography in and around what should have been an epic showdown instead felt very stunted, tight, and closed in. The camera work, along with the choreography, left the final climax feeling bereft of power. The sequence also came off as rather hurried, failing to allow sufficient time for the audience to go along for the ride. A lot of films these days don't strongly established geography within a scene and this final showdown scene was no exception.The movie is perfectly watchable but won't leave you wowed like Disney's animated version did.",Mulan

1019,imdb-09139,Good Chinese culture targeting movie,8,5 December 2020,"I don't see myself as an expert on Asian movies at all. But from the few dozen Asian movies I watched, it became very clear to me after just 2 minutes that this was not a movie targeted for western movie taste. Actually I wonder why it was marketed as such. Especially the fact that the new Aladdin remake was actually done as Hollywood-like as it can get (Will Smith guys, just think about it), understandably people were expecting something similar from this movie.But here we are and it is very important before watching this film to know up front that this is not a Hollywood movie, it's trying a balance act of providing Chinese style action and war movie making and still somehow trying to target western cultures with its story as well. You can feel the Chinese filmmaking in action scenes where people are flying around, the many moments trying to advertise supposedly Chinese virtues like loyalty, or the many cheesy unexplained character opinion shifts (but these could also be just because it's targeted to children). But that's all just the different style and culture of filmmaking in China. Chinese viewers learned to ignore the weird parts (and even came to like them!), so they focus on the entertainment, not the question if it makes sense - it's a movie after all, not a documentation.If you can focus on getting entertained and don't take the story or action too seriously, you can enjoy this movie. I think it deserves a 6/10 realistically, but because others seem to be overly negative with their rating I'm giving this 8/10 as I can imagine children like it that much. I think most bad ratings are because of unmet expectations (yes, it's very different than the animation film) and just the fact that it's not a Hollywood movie, which is unfair in my opinion. Ratings like 1 stars should be reserved for movies like Percy Jackson, where also the acting, action scenes, camera and editing are bad - all of these points are actually good here, it's just good from a different culture perspective. The most lacking part is actually the story telling, from all perspectives.",Mulan

Y'all are brainwashed by Disney think that disney live action films are better than the original. When it's really not. I mean, they might be some good live action movies. But Disney makes them cheap and lazy looking. Disney needs to do better though. It's not the actors fault. It's Disney's fault. Disney has rushed through making live action movies recently...

But after watching it, I say that it was certainly one of the worst things I watched. One of the few good things is the sets and costumes but that's the least you'd expect from a movie that cost over 200 million dollars, otherwise everything is bad.1. Actress Liu Yifei has no facial expression she is a great rival to Kirsten Stewart2. Mulan's development is horrible because in animation she had to train a lot to become a warrior, in this film Mulan is simply super strong since she was a child, this ended the message of overcoming animation.3 The director said she took away the Mu Shu and the music to make the film more realistic, ok because a woman who transforms into animals and other people (like the Mystique of the X-means) is super realistic.4. Mulan's romantic partner is just as she is poorly developed and does not convey any emotion.5. The massage given to us in the animation of 98 was that you can be whatever you want regardless of gender or race just make an effort and don't give up, this beautiful message was replaced by ""If you were born strong you will be a hero, otherwise you will remain a loser no matter how hard you try""In short, it was a film that had great potential, but wasted by the poor choice of developers, everything to make an average with the Chinese audience, but even that did not succeed, that is, this film is a complete failure, watch the animation that is infinitely better.",Mulan

1046,aljaz_kerc,Best Disney live-action remake so far,7,6 September 2020,"I was reading all these negative reviews before watching, so I went into it with low expectations.
About my Disney remake experience so far: watched original Aladdin as a kid, and I still find it incredible, with great script and amazing soundtrack; on the other hand I couldn't watch more than 30 minutes of the remake which was unimaginative, complete cringe, garbage renditions of the original songs, Smith's genie was a sort of a ghetto joke,.. To say the least, I found it to be the most cringe thing I've seen in a while.
When I saw they were remaking Mulan, I expected another uninspired money-grabbing cringefest from Disney, but instead we got teen oriented kungfu flick that stands far enough from the original not to feel uninspired but fresh, there were no musical scenes that are such a great part of Disney animations but turn cringe when done in live action movies (case in point- Aladdin 2019) and I commend the director for avoiding it. There is some renditioned soundtrack from the original Mulan in this movie, just a taste of it, that gives that sense of nostalgia to anyone that watched animation as a kid; I would have preferred more of the original soundtrack, I was especially interested to hear rendition of the song I'll make a man out of you, but I guess we're gonna have to wait for that until the next remake, which should be coming in next 10-15 years (because Disney, ofc).
There are a lot of things wrong with this movie if you care to look for it: plotholes, plot armor, some cringe moments, some problems with script dialogue at points and editing blunders, some cliche moments etc. that is if you look for it.But...if you're watching this for entertainment value, I think it's definitely the best Disney live-action remake so far, and great action and message far outweighs the cringe, which is something I thought I could never again say about a product of Disney.Definitely recommended.",Mulan

Directed by Niki Caro, whose enchanting 2002 film ""Whale Rider"" felt like a family-friendly, live-action Disney fantasy, ""Mulan"" is no mere remake. It's simultaneously an homage to and an overhaul of the 1998 animated feature, a robust reimagining of that film's original source, Yuefu folk song ""The Ballad of Mulan,"" and the somewhat dated cartoon it spawned. Unlike ""The Lion King"" or ""Beauty and the Beast,"" which slavishly adhered to their underlying IP, ""Mulan"" feels as if it were made by someone who didn't necessarily love Disney's earlier treatment.

1058,LarsNielsen,Surprisingly good - not a remake,7,12 December 2020,"I did not see the first Mulan, and I suspect that really made a difference. From what I have been told, the story has changed, I would say improved, from the old fashioned Disney values to new and more modern ways at looking at women and no talking funny dragon, which wouldn't really fit in either. This version is probably less funny than the original and some of the acting was a bit stiff, but I love Donnie Yen, something that to me is a great plus.It is beautifully filmed and some nice inspiration from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.Forget about the first Mulan movie and enjoy it as a separate film, with an open mind, the bad reviews are not fair. It is a fine family watch",Mulan

No smart talking dragons. I like the casting on the whole, her battalion buddies were enjoyable, decent wire work and martial arts (though have seen better from all involved) and the pace was pretty constant. Some of the shots seemed unnecessary and I'd be surprised if the writer and director didn't watch it and think ""wish we'd done that differently"" for at least a few scenes. Is it a £200m film though? No, I can't see how they did that. Did I enjoy it? Yes I did. Made me reflect on my western virtues as well, so well done!",Mulan

Mulan was supposed to be a normal, broken person with a fighting human spirit. She had willpower. She had love. She believed in honor. She believed in soul.I think the new Mulan just had too big of a shoes to fill. They also took out Mushu. That took out part of the ""soul"" of the Mulan movie. They also took out the ""human"" part of Mulan. The other ""soul"" of a Mulan movie.I don't think anyone could remake a legend like the animated Mulan... not even Disney.It was very beautiful on the eyes though.

This is mine"" so with that in mind watch this movie like it is Another version of the story. Now to the review this movie was surprisingly spectacular. Mulan the cartoon was one of my favorites as a kid, but I liked it not because it was funny or a musical (though those things don't hurt) but the story itself and I think the movie captures that essence.

We know nothing about anyone's background (except for the 3 minutes spent on Mulan being more like a warrior than a typical woman for her community). None of these characters make sense and I don't care about any of them. Usually in a movie like this the audience is supposed to root for one side or another. However, in this movie, I kind of just don't really care how the ending will turn out. I have no idea who the main antagonist really is, or why they are doing the things portrayed in this movie.

Unfortunately, what we got was neither a great original or a great remake. I enjoyed parts of it, the lead was good, and I could laugh at some of the attempted humor, but overall it was just a poorly made movie. So many things that happen are completely illogical and or not at all realistic. I felt the addition of magic was unnecessary, especially if this is supposed to be the ""real world"", but even that I could've accepted if they had been consistent!

1078,zerixos,"Form over function, influence from the animation but not the charm.",4,6 September 2020,"I been pretty excited when they announced a life action remake from Mulan. It suits a life action better than some other story's but it's been done poorly.First of all I'm happy to see it's not an direct copy of the animation in terms of story. It's starts somewhat on the same foot but takes a little detour along the way introducing a Little magic and taking some away. This is all good and well if it was for the better but that's where they get lost. The characters are poorly developed especially the main characters. They stay somewhat the same the whole movie except they gain some skills but they are not grown in personality. Mulan grows a bit in the beginning but doesn't gain any skills (she already has them). This makes the story some what plain.So the story is mediocre but serves the purpose of telling about Mulan, the story we already know. Therefor I'd expected to be a visual masterpiece, and it is if it wasn't for the special effects .The scenes are well lit and styled, the outfits are amazing and beautiful to see. The scenery feels less recognizable but is stunning. It's less China and more Silk Road. But then there are the visual effects: they look cheap and uncontrolled. It's like they put form over function. The visuals do not serve the story, the story is just to drive the movie from scene to scene so they can show new stuff.If you're a Mulan fan or a movie fan in general, skip this one. If you like to pauze a move a thousand times to watch some scenery your in for a treat. Either way, it feels like a generic movie that's far beneath Disney A Titles.",Mulan

Great settings, backdrops etc

There was little to no character development. The acting was almost bland.

She alone is perfect.Her father is very much interested in the concept of her bringing honour to the family ... and not in Mulan herself.It got some good action sequences but the plot is missing... seems the Mouse did not get what this movie is all about.Would not pay a dime to watch it, watch the animated movie again or the mulan live action from a few years back ... don't waste your time!",Mulan
1086,Dormamu,A catastrophe,2,14 September 2020,"Having seen most of the modern live-action remakes to Disney classics and having read some of the reviews for this one, I went into this movie with my expectations set on minimum. I really wanted to be surprised and enjoy it, to say the least. I don't hate all the previous remakes, I thought Beauty and The Beast was pretty good, and Aladdin and The Lion King just fine (although none of them come even close to the originals). Next in line comes Mulan, the newest Disney live-action re-imagining of an animated classic. Right from the first scene, this movie seems...sloppy, clumsy, unfinished. The visuals and cinematography were pretty good most of the time and that's pretty much everything good about it. Everything else from the script to the characters, to the acting is terrible. I don't know much about the original Chinese tale of Mulan, but since this is a remake of the animated movie, the story is butchered. I get the themes they were trying to touch upon, like a girl living in a ""man's world"", the value of family, finding your place and accepting yourself for who you really are. None of these is really achieved. Right from the start we learn that Mulan has powers and even from young age she can fight better than experienced fighters, this alone ruins the whole movie for me. You don't need to know how to fight in order to be a fighter, it's something the writers should know. The whole second act of the original movie is Mulan training in the camp disguised as a man and learning how to fight to honor her family and her country, she didn't come there already knowing kung-fu, sword fighting and having super powers. She needs to make sacrifices in order to get better and in this journey she makes friends and enemies. But now, knowing that she is already stronger than the whole Chinese army, how are we supposed to feel anything for her during this whole movie? There are literally zero stakes, she can beat anything and anyone, well except her evil counterpart witch Xian, probably the worst written character in this whole movie. At the beginning she is presented as the main villain (not the evil Khan), but in the final battle they try to make her a tragic character, a woman who made the mistake of being born on the wrong side. The fights are terrible, especially that big battle scene with zero logic and sense, the characters are mostly one-dimensional, corny, terribly acted and there for the sake of it. I can talk about this for the rest of the day but i'd rather not. All i can say is this movie is a corny mess with no real stakes, terrible screenplay, terrible casting (except Donnie Yen) and some really awful decisions story wise. Being a sloppy, heartless ride, I can honestly say that in my opinion this is the worst live-action Disney remake up to this point.",Mulan

As a Chinese who's also been exposed a lot to western and Disney culture, I love both how the original animated version and how the live-action 2020 take in a different way. The live-action 2020 is epic and more feminized in my opinion. The action scenes are without doubt spectacular, the emotions are also well elaborated. Mulan and her father, Mulan and Honghui, Mualn and Xianniang...I love the way they interact and the meanings behind it.

1092,sdumistracel,Painful to watch for a long time fan,3,4 September 2020,"I tried to enjoy the movie. I really did. But I really couldn't. My biggest issue was perhaps the fact that in this Mulan is a prodigy, ""chosen one"" kind of character. What really made the original character great was the fact that she achieved everything through intelligence and hard work. If you take that from her, she is virtually another character.
Then, I didn't really feel the acting. In some scenes I was expecting some emotion from the actors but they just kept a straight face and I really disconnected from the scenes.
Also, a few very important scenes from the first film were omitted or downplayed a lot. Take the scene where Mulan leaves for war for instance. I blinked and it was over.
From what I understand they got rid of Mushu and all the songs to make the movie more realistic, but yeah they added a witch and magic, which of course are a part of daily life (if you live in Harry Potter).
I was expecting epic battle scenes, but they really felt weird? Like Avatar the Last Airbender level of weird.
However I really enjoyed the costumes and the scenery, so the movie isn't fully irredeemable.
I wouldn't have mind the fact that it isn't a lot like the original if the movie was done right, but I felt that Disney got rid of all the parts that made the original great and I am truly unhappy with the result. Maybe some people enjoy this new way Mulan's character is presented, but I will stick to the original.",Mulan

In order to be loved by people who liked the originals, they should NOT be changed.The attempt that disney made to modernize this film was not executed well at all. If you want to make a movie that adheres more to todays current events, then do another movie! Do not change a beautiful classic that we all love and hold close to our hearts.I was expecting so much more from this movie. I am glad I watched it at a friends house, and did not pay for it.

1094,dumitruionut-05641,A great movie made by disney,10,6 September 2020,"I honestly don't know why this movie got this really bad rating and why some people hate it. It's one of the greatest live action adaptation of a disney film. People don't like the actress, Liu Yifei because some politicals controversities but chill up she is just playing a characters in here. Some people don't like it because of Mushu who is missing or the songs from the original. But this is not only a live action adaptation, it is also bassed on the ""Ballad of Hua Mulan"".
I loved everything about this film. It is very colorful and so beautiful to see , nice characters from the originals are in here and new ones added. It's visually stunning!I liked the new version of Mulan - she wants to take her father's place in the war that threatens the kingdom and she does so. She was trained to fight, and she wants to bring honor to the family.
She is a bold character, optimistic and confidant.
She takes great advices from the witch.The witch is a powerful character added to the new story of mulan. She isn't really bad, she just want to integrate and was exilated her whole life. She gives me ""Snow White and the Huntsman "" vibes.Bori Khan - he is the villain to the new movie and a new version of Shan Yu. He wants to take down the emperor and rule China and he wants revenge of his father death.Honghui - it's Mulan's love interest of this film. They have a huge connection but they don't kiss or stay together in this film. He is replacement to Li Shang and it's a cool character. He helps both Mulan and Hua Jun. And it's very friendly.I loved the script, it was different from the animation. But it kept some originals scenes like the matchmaker scene or the snow avalanche. I liked that in this version Cricket was mentioned as a human character and in this movie, Mulan's grandpa is replaced by her sister. I didn't quit like the fact that grandpa was missing but i liked it anyway. The songs from the animations are played in the background and there is a lot of actions in the last half of the film. I liked the relation between Mulan and her father. And i liked the misterious Phoenix who is showing around Mulan in time to time.I really hope they make a sequel to this because i want to see more of this beautiful movie, and more of this characters or about the phoenix. This was a masterpiece and i'm glad it was made. Good job director and Disney for making this great film!

1095,ceciliagiray,Absolutely Amazing,10,4 September 2020,"I keep seeing comments all over social media about how people don't want to even bother watching this movie because there is""no mushu and no songs/music"". I'm telling you to just go watch it. This movie was indeed very different than the cartoon but it also had all the characters and many nearly identical scenes to the original movie. Other than that, there is a kind of version of Mushu in the film that is summoned by the father the same way he did when mushu was sent by the ancestors. The difference is that he is a Phoenix instead of a Dragon and he does not speak. He guides Mulan throughout her journey and empowers her. Mulan is also a lot more powerful in this film than in the original. She is the one to reveal her own true identity to her men because she felt she needed to embrace the virtue of truth in order to fully embrace her power. She isn't caught like in the original. As far as music goes? Absolutely not. That would have completely ruined this film. The tone of this movie is a bit more serious than your typical Disney live action remake. It's a war movie. It has its light hearted moments but the overall tone is serious. There is one scene where they speak the lines to one of the songs. The score includes the original music but no singing. The stunts and fighting in this movie were also extremely good. There were stunts in this movie done on horseback I've never seen done before. As a general rule I don't think Disney really shows blood in any of their movies and even though this movie is very violent, you never see any blood. The fighting and scenes of dead soldiers could be quite frightening for little ones so be careful about watching this one with very young children. Like I said, this IS a war movie with a few brutal fight scenes where many people are killed. The overall movie was amazing and I think people should really give it a shot before they just brush it off for ""not being like the original"".",Mulan

I'm not sure how it would have been with the Phoenix as a character and the songs involved. But I could be wrong. But I thoroughly enjoyed it nevertheless. The main point of the storyline is that it defeats sexism. Gender bending feminism and encouraging empowerment and I think that will always stand and make it great. Great balance of humour too.

Yifei was the perfect Mulan. She is Mulan. I don't believe they could've found someone better.

1106,therossfamily-75518,Fantastic,10,29 January 2021,I think I have seen every Disney film bar this and never fancied the cartoon version we had nothing else to watch! And omg this did not disappoint Disney just can't do no wrong it is a fantastic film from start to finish its sooooooo good 💗💗💗💗,Mulan

Dragon trumps Phoenixs, whose stupid idea was it to get rid of Mushu??? the bird transforms into a woman or any form. Shang is not a general, but another soilder.I felt there were some interesting changes, in the movie, but over all the awesomeness I loved about Mulan, just wasnt there. The theme of the story may be similar. The story is DIFFERENT. It's very different from the animation, and it not the same.",Mulan
1108,illirianimage,Only good thing about this movie is costumes and sets,3,9 September 2020,"I love the legend of Mulan, it's such a cool character. This movie however does not do it justice apart from stunningly beautiful costumes and sets. hence the three stars. Not the fault of the actors i might add, they had so little to work with.
It differs quite a bit from the cartoon, The comedic parts are so watered down that they become totally forgetable.Kids:
Watch the cartoon instead. you won't forget that
grownups:
Everything Disney tries here was done in vastly superior fashion by Ang Lee in his masterpiece that is Crouching Tiger Hidden dragon.",Mulan

1110,acmulvey,Complete disappointment,2,5 September 2020,Out of all of the Disney remakes this had so much potential to make the action better with a live action version. This took all the best parts from the original cartoon and left them out substituting in uninteresting filler. There was no real character development and outside of Mulan there aren't any characters you get to know. Skip this movie.,Mulan
1111,firstunion,A bad review is undeserved,10,5 January 2021,"Sure, this version does not reflect the original cartoon, it stands alone by itself. The cinematography was great and the he story was compelling. What more can one ask for? I loved this movie and I have watched it over and over. I am sure that the haters of this movie loved The French Lieutenants Woman, which put me to sleep. This movie has a compelling plot line. It is aesthetically pleasing. Why in the wonderful world of sports would you hate on this movie! For anyone on the fence, take a risk, and watch this movie. You will be pleasantly surprised! For all of you wannabe reviewer's, sit down and shut up!",Mulan

Movie does justice to the morale and each every scene, acting is very well done. Brings all desired emotions. And for the noble intentions- for kids as well as for adults.",Mulan
1113,jennred-71894,Not What I Was Expecting,3,28 September 2020,"I'm being a bit kind by giving this movie three stars. I was disappointed, but I think the reason I was disappointed was because I went into the movie with certain expectations that were not met..They advertised and billed this movie like it was going to be a serious action film. And that's what I was expecting. That's what I was looking forward to. What I got was a mish-mash of Disney-esque martial arts.The problem with this movie is it couldn't decide what it wanted to be - it wavered between serious action film, and cutesy Disney movie. It kept switching back and forth, which kept distracting me. And finally at the end, it dove, full blown, into Disney realm with techno-color backgrounds and plot holes so big you could drive a truck through them.I wish that Disney hadn't made this movie - I wish a different production company had made it. Because it would have been a great action/kungfu film! But the Disney cute/cute/haha ruined the movie.Now that's an adult's opinion - I'm sure kids will love it. Which I guess is the whole point of a Disney movie.Also - as a final word. So NOT worth $30 to rent!! Wait until it comes out on bluray.",Mulan

1115,hashtagpantz,Guess what's bad,3,6 September 2020,"This movie is what's bad. The only thing redeemable about it is the visual effects. Everything else fails to succeed. The action scenes are way to goofy and unrealistic to enjoy, the comedy falls flat every single time, and the cuts are awkward and make the movie hard to watch. The most iconic song from the original movie was ""I'll make a man out of you,"" but when they deliver that line and head into montage in the remake, the song doesn't play. The entire movie doesn't know what it is besides ""Mulan"", and things constantly feel missing.",Mulan
1116,maimoua,Great movie!,10,5 September 2020,"People are crying about it not being exactly like the animated version. Hello, it's a live version it has to have some twists and turns to it.

1118,thomsonmatthewj,Bad reviews are liar fan boys,10,6 September 2020,This movie was amazing! The only people who are putting bad reviews are people who like musicals and children's stories. This was pure action movie and had many improvements from the original.

This is one of the few actually good Live-action movie remakes Disney has made. What's not to love? I hope this movie gets a sequel. I have a feeling why this movie feels a slight bit incomplete. They are probably working on a sequel. Let's see....",Mulan
1120,mail-67039-55988,Worst Disney live action so far,3,11 January 2021,"This is the first Live action movie from Disney that made me turn off the movie I guess about half way in. Wow what a drag this one was. They really messed up with this one. The movie has no soul what so ever. When you watch it you feel like you are just watching one thing after another happen on screen. Its just so boring. Great set designs will do you no good when the script is just terrible. None of the characters have any chemistry. They also took away some of the more awesome parts of Mulan. Especially Muchu. Something I could have forgiven if they in fact were going for a more realistic take on the animated version. This was not the case at all. The movie includes magic never seen before in the Mulan movies. So I stopped watching this, and then we watched the animated version in stead. You would be wise to do the same.",Mulan

It's a REIMAGINING,9,5 April 2021,"When you review the film don't base it on what it was and what it is now.This has been made as its own version of the original story of Mulan. I've heard a lot of comments like where is the music ect. But the film did amazing to NOT be entirely like the original and in turn be ORIGINAL.A fantastic story that kept us gripped throughout I think it could have been longer but it tied itself up beautifully, well done.",Mulan

1131,ssmyen,Cheesy and unrealistic,2,5 September 2020,"We understand that the movie is based on Disney's interpretation of Mulan and not the real Chinese story, however anyone with Mandarin background watching this movie is deemed to get bad cringes. The history here is so off, while Mulan is from approx 420 AD, she somehow lives in a Hakka style rural dwelling called Fujian Tulou that existed only 1000 years later. It's as awkward as portraying King Arthur living in the Buckingham Palace.",Mulan
1132,n-55356,Amazing Mulan,9,4 September 2020,"This is a familiar story, a different way of expression. The performance of the actors is also very satisfied. Disney will always surprise you. Although not always, this does not prevent you from going to a Disney movie. You can always find touching scenes or fragments in the movie. Although this movie does not have the classic characters of cartoons, it does not prevent it from being a moving movie and a qualified Disney commercial film. And it's worth watching twice.",Mulan

Seemed like ""Rise of the Skywalker"" mixed with old Mulan in they tried to hard to show shades of the old to mix with the new, but falls very short. Plus no songs or Mushu. Save yourself the time and $30.",Mulan
1135,RedForest4200,Soulless and Forgettable,3,6 September 2020,"I tried to go into this with an open mind but the fact is, it's just not good. Some nice scenery, but the world building was just not there. It tries to distance itself from the animated film which is fine, even good... but in its place is a lack of character development or depth. If you're not going to cultivate a new worthwhile narrative than you need to replicate the story or the original, this does neither. It's like they couldn't decide which to do.
The biggest problem with this film though was just that the payoff was so lacklustre. Seemingly small scaled and uneventful, I can't remember watching a 2 hour movie before where every single person in the room was like 'was that it?' when the credits rolled.
Maybe this movie is just meant for kids, maybe my view is irrelevant. But for me, this movie joins the rest of the Disney remakes I've seen as soulless corporate filmmaking that adds absolutely nothing to culture. A movie that won't be talked about every again. There are better ways to spend $30, and there are a lot better ways to spend 2 hours.",Mulan
1136,kindsword-72800,"Not perfect, but still very good, you need to see it twice to notice the details",10,7 September 2020,"Before I paid Disney $35(CAD), I'd watched/read lots reviews on it, I was kind of prepared and also got disappointed like others. The main weaknesses are:
The story is kind of rush. Mulan is not a regular girl, instead a kind of martial art genies. No smooth transition of Mulan's inner change from hiding herself to completely expressing the true her. The fighting actions sometimes look funny.
But when I watch it the second time, I actually noticed lots of details I missed the first time. The director and screenwriter actually made efforts to make the story complete, just some of the key lines are not emphasized so that they are easily neglected. And although a live version, it is still a fairy tale, a legend, not some realistic heroic action movie. We should not see it the same way as we see Brave Heart. You can clearly see this for the fact that there is not even one drop of blood on any dead soldiers' body. The main weak point is actually the performance of the leading actress, she could have had more facial expression to express more inner emotion. BTW, the character of the hawk is very crucial to the whole story, she represents the class of women who are crushed in a men's world and crave to make a change and meanwhile feel so hopeless. Millions of women like her fight in their own way for equal rights, it's their scarifies that pave the way to success for a small number of wonderful women like Mulan.
BTW, I would give 8, but give 10 to balance the low rate by the haters.",Mulan
1137,stephaniefait,Do Not compare to animation!,10,13 September 2020,I created an account JUST to share this information! Stop comparing to animation!! We don't want a carbon copy of it- this is a great movie and nods to certain characters like the cricket. And the songs they have a little instrumental for it. That's enough! People rating it a 1/10 is ridiculous! It doesn't deserve that. It's a great movie in general. It should bring us surprises and different feel which it did.,Mulan
1138,yahoomeat,Excelent movie making,10,17 September 2020,Screenplay and dialog between actors was very entertaining. Beautiful cinematography and spacial effects made this movie a pleasure to watch. Director Niki Caro did a wonderful job telling a story of a woman discovering her true uniqueness in the early centuries governed by cultural traditions. Personally I find it refreshing to see actresses expressing what it means to be a woman in a world dominated by men. To see a woman expressing her emotions through a character on screen brings a sense of authenticity to the human experience and what it means to be woman.,Mulan
1139,wolfleroi,Abomination,1,26 September 2020,"Thats probably the nicest thing i can say right now. Does no justice to chinese culture, the animation or the real story at all. They took the animation and took all the good parts out and whats left is this pile of dirt",Mulan

1141,qtvbunny,Live-Action Gone Wrong,4,17 October 2020,"This movie just ruined the first Mulan, for me. The new plot they wrote just reminded me of this old Disney movie, Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior.The entire intro, introducing Mulan's 'chi' was unnecessary. I hated the idea of witchcraft in the story. I didn't like that the enemies' soldiers could run up walls. It just reminds me of those old asian kung fu movies. I'm not saying those movies were bad, but I just didn't like the realistic part of the story gone, like from the animated. Even the matchmaker scene where Mulan got kicked out for dealing with the spider (because her sister was afraid of it) was just ridiculous.I also wished they used a dragon instead of a phoenix to be Mulan's 'guide'. It would have been way cooler, but I guess they didn't have the budget for that. Got big bi energy from Chen.The only thing I may have liked from this film is the dramatic side of the story. Since it's a live-action of the original, I could really feel the emotions.",Mulan

Although there are some 'magical' elements I think they found a good balance between believability and the suspension of disbelief.The main theme I took away from this film is family honour and respect are important in Chinese culture and I feel the movie addressed these virtues well.A lot of reviews complain about the lack of the 1998 elements but those would never have worked in a live action movie.Don't believe everything you read from users reviews (including this one).watch it for yoyrself and go in with an open mind.",Mulan

The casting was horrible and none of the actors could act. I am embarrassed to have laid my eyes upon this car crash.Why would they add a literal witch and not Mushu. The witch had no relevance and had no reason to be put in the movie. It's completely different! Why did they even call it a remake if they just changed up everything.

Not the same clumsy girl who works hard to fight for her family honor.There's also no comic element, nor sense of timing.

The animation is a fave and hard to top but I held my breath and cried too many times than I could count. The changes were major but necessary and made an old classic even better! This is how the Ballad of Hua Mulan is meant to be told. There is a scene of her on a horse with two rabbits running along her, is a GREAT symbolism taken directly from the poem itself. ""When a pair of rabbits run side by side, who can distinguish male from female?"" Yes Yes Yes! Very very thoughtful inclusion.Out with the haters! Jason Lee, Donnie Yen, Jet Li, the girl from Wuhan, Yifei Liu and the rest of the cast were sooooooo good! Definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen! A film for the ages. I hope they bag some Awards! Crouching Tiger meets Disney! Courage, honor to men and family, and the empowering message young women need to hear is more relevant than ever. Simply breathtaking.

But it's a family friendly movie so it's not suppose to be complicated.I enjoyed all the martial art they showcased here and they kept the original animated movie's soundtrack in the background which felt nice and familiar.I think if you don't compare this to the original animated one then you will enjoy this movie in the way that I did.",Mulan

1188,emily967166,Forget the Animation for one second,4,10 April 2021,"So many reviews saying this film is nothing like the animation. True. And that creates disappointment in its own right. Maybe that's where the film lost its magic.However, forget the animated version. Let's judge this film on its own merits. Sadly, nothing about this film works for me. It lacks character, script, development, depth and most of all soul.There are moments, small moments that capture the essence of what this film could have been, but everything else falls short.None of the characters stand out. They are dull, dull, dull. There's no rapport between the characters and there's certainly no depth or development.Secondly, there's no soundtrack, nothing that stands out and really drags you into a scene.Scenes are badly directed and lines are badly delivered. It feels like watching something amateur, wooden; ""acting by numbers"". It's really irritating to watch a scene and just find everything so forced and ""scripted"" and robotic. Soulless.The little script that exists is dreadful with lines badly delivered. There are No memorable lines. It's all delivered so blandly it's like eating cardboard. This film needed more dialogue, much more.The film in general is missing something. I feel as if there is no driving force. There's no background spirit or deity guiding or watching over Mulan. It would've been nice to have had an onscreen representation of the mystical other than the breadcrumbs we were given. We don't want breadcrumbs, we want the whole cake!Going back to characters etc. She's taking her fathers place to save his life but it's hard to understand why as there is little warmth between the characters. Every character is extremely harsh.Going back to the ancestors, this probably tied back into the animated film and needing mooshoo. Imagine if they had included the ancestors watching over Mulan behind the scenes and perhaps understanding what ""chi"" is a bit more. They chose not to include anything mystical and yet expect us to believe in magic chi and powerful witches... it makes NO sense. Again there is so much this film is missing.The costumes are OK.Other annoying points - random slow mo thrown in to make an impact / emphasise the cool stunt - but this doesn't really work because the stunts aren't wow and the build up to that moment wasn't really a build up at all. It was just flat flat flat.The focus is all on Mulan. This sounds like a strange thing to say given it's all about Mulan, but there's no external reaction to her. It's hard to explain this one but sometimes it's about what others around Mulan are seeing and experiencing that would help her stand out more.This film is just completely soulless. It could have been much bolder and flamboyant. There could've been more depth and diversity. It has no flow and nothing is allowed to develop, nothing flows.Didn't really enjoy it and it certainly didn't live up to expectations.",Mulan

1193,aruki7,Some ratings seem unreal to me.,10,5 September 2020,"I don't like how Disney is handling projects lately (ex. Star Wars trilogy) but I neither get the haters of this film. They do a frame-by-frame copy of the original you find it unoriginal, they spice it up a bit and you complain that it ruins the original!
I loved the first Mulan and this is a slightly different version that is just as great! Yifei Liu is perfect as Mulan, so is the music and the cinematography. The pace of the film keeps you interested and hooked at all times (at least I was). The only things I would change is the somewhat lack of humor and the existence of the witch which I found unnecessary.
Unlike other hero and Disney movies, the story of Mulan is centered 100% around the evolution of one protagonist and less around secondary characters or their dynamics. In this film, the lead actress did such an amazing job portraying Hua Mulan that it made the absence of other supporting characters like Mushu seem irrelative to me (and I love Mushu!).
To conclude, this film is worth 8 stars but I gave it 10 to balance the unfair 1star reviews.

So my viewing of the live action adaption was a compete blind watch.
And to be honest, all the negative reviews made me nervous going in.
But what a pleasant surprise.
Sure, Mulan herself didn't convey a lot of emotion, not until the final scenes of the movie. I get that as a complaint. But the actress did a fine job. It was her character. And this is a reimagining, not a remake.
Overall though, I found this to be a thoroughly engaging and entertaining film.
Fantastic set design, costuming, score and some really cool fight scenes.
Yeah. Lots of wires involved, but I went with it.
This movie entertained me from beginning to end and even managed to evoke a little tear out of me at the end.

Female empowerment.
Great Chinese cast.
Rousing entertainment.

1199,lisa-ta93,Oh the anticipation,3,7 September 2020,"First thing's first - don't expect for this film to be remotely close to the Mulan you remembered in 1998. Don't expect for this to be nostalgic and also don't expect to be singing along to songs in your living room with the $30 you paid for.Cons
Here's a few things
There's no Mushu, there's no Shang, no grandma, no cricketThere's poor character development and depthThe iconic scenes on Mulan's transition was poorly developed.The scenes were very rushed and we barely got the chance to watch the scenes that were iconic to the storylineIt was fluffy. Very very fluffyThere was a neverending use of ""disgrace"" and ""dishonour"" yes we get it but if we wanted to play word bingo, Disney could've added a $2.50 print-at-home templateSomewhat pros
Don't get me wrong, what I enjoy about this film was the creative spin to the storyline - but boy oh boy did they go on a creative spin alright. So creative you're probably scratching your head wondering if this was an adaption of the Mulan in 1998 or another film adopting the name instead. But anyway, on a positive note, the acting was actually great and I wouldn't fault that. The special effects was pretty good and enjoyable to watch so kudos to the cast and special effects team.",Mulan

I was disappointed that there was no singing but it was still a great movie. Don't listen to the hate. The people who dislike it are the ones who wanted an exact Copy of the cartoon.

1202,cvc97,Get over it,9,7 September 2020,"I think most people are upset about the $30 for streaming a movie.It's more of a 7, but I gave it a 9 to balance.If you're expecting this to be a complete remake of the original, you're going to be disappointed, which by reading the reviews is the majority.The negatives, I believe Wushu wasn't added because it wasn't representative of the perception of a dragon in the Chinese culture.It isn't a typical Disney movie, as it lacked the song and dance as most Disney movies have. If you expected that, yes, you will also be disappointed. Also a little more combat/violence for a Disney movie, the arrows going through the chest?With the negatives aside, the positive was the cultural sensitivity and promoting the Chinese culture to the world. The production. The vocal training? or was it vocal CGI? I'm a fan of Jet Li and Donnie Yen (because of my background in MMA) and their speech/acting is better than all their previous movies.Also positives, casting Gong Li, and the cameo from the original Ming Na Wen, getting Jet Li AND Donnie Yen in the same movie.Also positives, it's still at the core a Disney movie, finding that heartfelt magic, the moral of the story at the end : ""Loyalty to Family"". Will this be a Frozen franchise phenomenon? No. But come on, it's better than John Carter or Tomorrowland and we all know it.",Mulan

Mr. Yan does show his skills during the training-scenes and Lady Liu does show her abilities in a very soft ""hidden tiger, crouching dragon""-style. For those that haven't seen Ipman or the Shaolin-movies with Jet Li, Mulan is probably a exciting.

Ok I have never seen the animated film but, if its anything like this it will be fab. My only criticism is it is a war film with a lot of action and fighting and I would not recommend this as film for children, and I am a bit shocked that it is a Disney film.I really am not getting what people gripe about it is? Its beautifully filmed, amazing effects and absolutely flawless CGI. I think the people these days are really spoilt with films and because of remakes find it very easy to criticise something because they are expecting what they know.... Don't!!!!!
Watch the film as the film it is, its incredibly entertaining, despite my gripes about it not really being for children.... If thats what peoples problem is, say that, don't just have a go a criticise because you thought it was something else!!!I really have liked all the remakes that Disney have done, the Lion King, Dumbo, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast etc.... I thought they were all amazing. But if people want to be stuck into the old films and slate new ""real' versions of films, then I think you are very sad. Its not like they've not been done in fabulous Disney style with no expense spared, some people are just stuck in the past.So, I highly recommend this film, It definitely isn't for little ones.... I am going to have to watch the original animated one to see how they got away with all the war and fighting in that.... Surely thats part of the story????
Please watch it, ignore the people that just find it so easy to criticise, and make up your own mind.Very entertaining.

You gave her magical powers and added a shapeshifting witch that honestly serves no purpose other than turning into a bird at the right time (if you know you know).

They took out so many things of made the original good, that the movie is simply something else. It gave me no sense of nostalgia, no scenes were taken literally, not even the music! Nothing like how fun Aladdin was.For starters there is no way a woman could hide her period in those times. She was sleeping for months inside a tent with all the other soldiers. What would she do with the soiled cloth? Where would she procure more? How would she avoid getting soiled mid training? Really, there was no need to be such a stickler to things being realistic, because the story simply can't be told that way.By taking out the songs that said a lot about the characters throughout the movie and the fun that Mushu provided, they killed many of the scenes that really brought secondary characters into light and helped develop them. The trial she overcame in the cartoon movie required thinking, using her smarts and her newfound strength. How did she do it here? Concentrating her chi? Utter nonsense. Also, Mushu and Cricket saved her from many close calls. It made sense that she would need help hiding her identity.Why did they cheapen her love story? Her relationship growing throughout the movie was so important, and the fact that he was her officer was important as well! Where they afraid it was feminist enough? That her love interest was in a position of power above her looked bad for the press?The role of the witch felt like ti was there simply because there weren't enough relevant women. And since she couldn't be evil, she had to be a subjugated, misunderstood, powerful woman that in the end died for Mulan because she had triumphed where the elder woman had failed. Oh, come on! Why not make Mushu a female phoenix? Would have made more sense!Anyhow, it has a few touching moments, but felt overall like a bad press movement trying to update a story that worked to make it fit into a modern narrative and destroying its essence in the process.",Mulan

It needs to be chinese, it needs to be a fairytale, it needs to have magic, it needs to be realisitic and above all....it need to be made for 'the western world', the US most prominently.What a piece of work this movie. The makers missed the incredible opportunity to make Mulan into a more authentic (as far as this is possible with this story) story. But they didn't. Far from it.Incorportating typical western ideologies, values and customes. The phoenix being the embodiment of this all. This creature was on the wrong set, in the wrong story for -probably- the right reason. But then...stay true to the Chinese setting. Make it into a Fenghuang, leader of women. I get that!Disney only shows it wants to rule the world with their vision, rewriting other cultures as they see fit. And by all means, it is the freedom of every storyteller to do so.

The animated film created a character girls could strive to be like. This version made a chosen one story where girls can be as good as guys if they have mega-powerful chi. This movie says to even be on par with men you basically have to be a witch.You can't even enjoy the fight scenes as mindless action. I love some lady kicking butt scenes, but I couldn't get into these.The wire work looks dreadful. The slow motion was overdone and only exacerbated the problem with the fake fighting.Also why do girls have to do action scenes with their hair down? They made a big point of her stupidly going into battle without her armour or helmet which in real life is the fastest way to get killed. The reason they did that was so she could look pretty and graceful while she kicked butt.The more I think about this film, the worse it gets. A film should get better with contemplation.

4. Bori Khan wanted to kill Mulan with an arrow, but the witch sacrifices herself to protect Mulan.

1234,DiamondOwl88,IF YOU RATED THIS 1 STAR YOUR WRONG!,10,9 September 2020,"The best Disney live action so far! Everyone who is on the fence about watching this... WATCH IT AND HAVE YOUR OWN OPINION!! I don't agree with spending £19.99 instead of watching in cinemas where it would be outstanding but hey that's Disney for you. STOP WHINGING ABOUT THE ORIGINAL ITS NOT MEANT TO BE THE SAME!! ITS NOT 1998!! This film is beautifully filmed, incredibly directed and incredibly well acted. If you want a little Dragon making you laugh and lots of singing just watch the original. If you have an open mind and love Martial Arts its the movie for you. I'm glad Disney have finally made a live action that doesn't contain every song and taken the exact script from the original just like all the others. They definitely wanted to try and make something new and it WORKS! Best way to watch it is to just let Disney take you on a new path of film making and story telling instead of serving up the same rubbish year in and year out. If you want to see a Mulan 1998 remake then don't watch this because its not the same film its something new and ORIGINAL! If they remade every Disney film as just carbon copies they would all be pointless. WELL DONE FOR FINALLY CREATING SOMETHING ORIGINAL AND FRESH. This has restored my faith in new Disney live actions.",Mulan

NO songs NO copy paste (entirely different approach)
I saw women empowerment in movie, (Courage, sens of humor, smart)
best things in movie character built (A girl want to be warrior), Father- Daughter relation(every scene of those your eyes will melt if you have heart) , Honest with Patriotism.

This story in live action format had to be done in the serious tone it was and I'm glad the decisions to not include the music, comedy, and Mushu were made. In all honesty if it had been done to mirror the animated film the way previous ones have I probably only would've watched it at the request of my children, but instead I was the one making the request to sit with me and enjoy the film. People need to stop with the ""it ruined my childhood"" and ""they only did it to make a woke film.""

1247,stojaobradovic,You just need to be born special,1,7 September 2020,"I needed to watch the original version right after, just to rinse off the bitterness left in my mouth. In this movie, Mulan is born with a little somethin' somethin' that she had to keep hidden from the rest of her family because you know - patriarchy. Once she realized she should release her inner goddess - things get done. No heroes journey, no effort made to acquire skills needed for battle - nothing.
I can ignore the lack of charisma in almost all characters and a lot of pathetic humorless scenes but...
In the original version, Mulan was a confused awkward child that used her smarts and worked really hard to deserve the position and respect in the army. New Mulan was born with it. The cartoon depicts a true battle for equality girls like me needed while growing up while the new movie reruns the same idea from Disney's Star Wars - entitled protagonist.
""Make a man out of you"" is maybe the most inspiring song I ever heard, it can give me the energy to start learning for the hardest exam, start boxing, go to war, build myself a house, become an astronaut...
The new movie teaches me to... be nice to my personal witch, she may betray me otherwise.",Mulan

(Ex: no mushu, no singing, added villian characters, etc.) Yes. But the plot stayed true to the original. A young girl who doesnt fit into the traditional role of a ""proper wife"" and instead chooses to protect her family bringing them honor by breaking the mold and becoming a warrior.The cinematography was beautiul and the actions scenes were well done.

The editing was so choppy some sequences didn't even make sense. All characters were only two dimensional and even though this may be true for the animated version, at least their performances could carry them and make them memorable.

They exchanged Mushu for a phoenix who dont speak a single world and I have a feeling that phoenix are just a metaphore and not a real thing on movie.
The Mulan on animation was a regular girl who become strong through hard work, the Mulan on movie are just a feminist dream of a strong woman with super-powers.As I said, if it was a random movie with other name, would be a ""cool but forgettable movie"", but when the proposal is a adapt a well renowned history, It should do it with fidelity and respect for the original work.Its a shame, the actress are super talented, in fact, perfect for the role and deserved a better script.

The landscapes are beautiful, the soundtrack, great, and it provides a lot of interesting, new ideas, which sadly weren't executed in the best way, being the villains a prime example of this.However, emotion-wise, the movie felt very flat. I blame it on the lack of characterization of Mulan and other protagonists, and the poor script, that included very forced dialogues with grandiloquent sentences but very little substance. There is barely any chemistry between characters and most of the pivotal moments in the movie came up as dull. Mulan, both the movie and character, are void of any emotions. That, added to the pacing problems, makes this movie feel rushed.As a remake, it's not really a good one. Mulan is a completely different character here, and a lot of the values she represented in the animated movie are not present here. Far less complex than her animated counterpart, Yifei's Mulan doesn't really ""feel"" like Mulan at all. And I'd say that Caro is guilty of a sin as old as time when it comes to empowered female characters: the concept that a strong woman is a badass woman with no flaws.In short: a mixed stand-alone film with flaws and redeeming points, a bad remake that does not really capture the magic and spirit of the animated one. Not worth the $30 imo.",Mulan

While it does follow the events of the animated movie in a close way, the movie failed to capture its spirit and complexity, especially when it comes to Mulan, which feels like a watered-down, Mary Sueish version of the animated character. I just wish directors and screenwriters realized that a strong female character is far more than ""a badass woman with no flaws that can fight"".It still remains an entertaining movie, hence the 5.

Here's why, if you watch Chinese films then you would know there has been quite a few Mulan films over the years.... What's another? If Disney was going to make just another Mulan film to add to Chinas collection of Mulan films then that's just what they did. This is suppose to be a Disney film, which means it's not suppose to be just another Mulan film, it's suppose to be magical, funny, heartwarming but serious at the same time with a beautiful ending that everyone understands. This did the total opposite, from emotionless to an open ending. Yes, it was an open ending.

It retells the Mulan Story in a deeper almost spiritual way, and is not at all boring or over the top and rather full of nuances and subtle in a message that does inspire not only women and girls but everyone from the 21 century. My immediate thought is that this might be much closer to the original Mulan story, and is not just a remake of a funny and classic but very Americanized animated version the 1998 Version was.
So everybody who expects another round of little annoying dragons trying to get around the problem to make foot massages to elderly ancestors might be disappointed.

It's got all the action that you'd find in a traditional wuxia film (without any historical accuracy), except it's like they forgot to add the actual story in. There were no meaningful connections made throughout the entirety of the film, so I didn't end up really caring about anyone Mulan came into contact with or even Mulan herself.

It reminded me of my young years watching Disney originals. This doesn't claim to be the original. It's been adapted and modernised which is what it's supposed to do like with everything in life moves with the times. I feel it captured the story well and made me reminisce of when I was a young girl watching it. Surely that's a good remake??? For me it's visually so much better then the original and I enjoyed as much as the original in different times. The acting was great. Few things I would of changed but nothing too much.

It's diffucult not to compare it to the original because most people who will see it, will have watched it. But there's no nostalgia here, the most memorable scenes are either botched or excluded, and if you are planning to watch it with your kids, they will surely fall asleep within the first 15 minute, as this movie has the strangest pacing issues, jumping all over the place without a coheseve exposition. Cast doesn't help it either, dialogues are so dumb, and the delivery is so unbeliavable that it looks like they were dubbed over the real dialgoues. Although I am biased towards Yifei Liu over her stance on Hong Kong protests, which is in itself an amazing irony, I can safely say that she doesn't own the role, it is as if she just stood there and the film happned around her. The main boss of the movie in the form of Drogo and Melisandra make as much sense as any other villain in Chinese pseudo-historical flick. Cinematography is mostly bad blue screen, film doesn't look like an American production, the wire-work is iffy and obvious, scenes with pagodas and the palace are few and far between. And lastly, the music from the original is used at the most unexplainable moments and is heard for 2 bars only at most. I can't think of a single moment I liked about this film.",Mulan

Maybe it's because they wanted the cliché romantic story like the cartoon.It's sad to see how people can't enjoy a great movie without the usual sexual tension! Mulan 2020 was filmed closer to the real story.I love that this movie focused on Chinese culture. If you don't like the movie I would say that maybe your racist against the Chinese culture. I've watched many ancient Chinese dramas and movies. Mulan was very close to the culture and sceneries.The acting wasn't fake and that's why I have always enjoyed Chinese dramas and movies. THEY DO THEIR OWN STUNTS! You can't say that isn't amazing.There is only a few American actors who do their own stunts who I truly appreciate being apart of the entertainment field. The Chinese culture is something to be enjoyed and appreciate.I may not be Chinese but I have always felt close to the culture. I'm happy Disney didn't make this movie cliché and corny like the cartoon. They made it more realistic.I hope you can enjoy this movie without the thoughts of negative comments.

1293,naftoala,Looks like a great amature fan made movie. Cheap for a Disney movie.,5,7 March 2021,"I understand that they made the story different but the movie is a way off, the acting is kinda cheezy, what's with the blurring background effect? The way they made twist for the important part of the story, just like how they knew she girl was just felt so awkward and lacking. The action was very good but the camera angles, the effects and just the rest about the movie was just dull. Nothing like a Disney movie, I would appreciate it more if it was a fan made in Youtube and came out like this. But Disney? really? Looks like a lazy project. I wish it was more moving and alive.",Mulan

It was certainly missing the comic relief. And it had zero soundtrack - which they saved for the credits! I could understand though that some of the changes were because it was ""real"" life. By why change the family structure?!They managed to accomplish the awkward edge of a female being around men. And it was successful in the sense that multiple generations enjoyed it ( my 9yr old daughter, me, and my mom). I loved that the costumes and casting was done well.Watch it - it is NOT as bad as some of the reviewers are portraying.",Mulan
1298,erincollman,what's the point?,1,14 September 2020,"Another forgetful disney remake! surprise! but this one takes the cake as the worst. what even is this the purpose of this film. they made this pg-13 and promised to make this more real (therefore they took out the music and mushu). but then the the movie starts off with the reveal that mulan has certain powers. who made this choice?? the whole point of mulan is that she is just a normal girl who wants to save her father so she makes a brave and noble choice to join the war. so all these emotional and impactful scenes from the first movie (such as when mulan climbs to the top of that post) are just thrown away. in this film we don't really want to root for mulan, she is not really relatable and just plain boring. there is also this random spirit lady (again this is not more realistic just more boring) that just makes no sense and seems like an afterthought. overall this film drags on. would not recommend, go watch the original one :))",Mulan

I like the fact that Disney consider that. I love the cast so much their chemistry is great! I love Yifei Liu and Gong Li (and when they're together haha) a lot! It's almost like they're asking one another and asking themselves. Also the interaction between Mulan and Honghui is subtly beautiful (don't know if it's a cultural thing I think the subtleness is actually very sexy haha, but if there's a sequel then please more love story of these two haha).

1307,previnhudetz,"Visually stunning, emotionally barren",5,6 September 2020,"The costumes, sets, action sequences and special effects in this movie were wonderfully done! Kudos to the people involved with that portion of the movie! But in terms of emotional courage in its message, there were so many missed opportunities in this production that I left feeling... not much.The actors did the best anyone could with the script they had. You can see them giving a solid effort, and they deserve positive recognition for that. But there weren't any brave choices made by the writers, director or producers, and that made the whole film fall flat. In the animated version of Mulan, gender roles and the moral authority of command structures were questioned. They didn't choose to explore that with any emotional depth, this time.The animated characters weren't perfect icons of virtue and infallibility, and that made them believable. It made them seem human. Unfortunately, in the live action version, we received characters with none of that complexity. It felt like a salute to authority figures, where none of the choices of the privileged ruling class were genuinely questioned. ""The Emperor killed my father and stole our land."" Yet, somehow the Emperor was still considered worth protecting. That's a hard sell, especially without any explanation.This version of the story of Mulan apparently operates under the assumption that everyone receives their due so long as they submit to the will of the state. It came off as little more than an overproduced piece of authoritative propaganda.Oh well. Maybe it'll get another reboot, someday. Until then, flawed as it might be, I'll stick with the animated version.",Mulan
1308,kitkatmercado-74166,It's a good movie,5,6 September 2020,I was just hoping that they would stick with the original one. Mushu should be part of the live action movie.... and where are the songs??? Overall its a good one and very entertaining ❤,Mulan
1309,emoboyz-92605,REMAKE DISNEY IS MORE SATISFYING THAN THE OTHER,8,7 September 2020,"It's hard to remake something that's already good, and that's on Disney's current agenda as it looks to want to remake all of its animated films into a live-action film, with Mulan being the last film and not likely the last to be remade.But Mulan succeeded. At least I can say it's more satisfying than some of Disney's latest remake films such as Dumbo and The Lion King, which both came out last year. With her beautiful visuals, hard-hitting actions and a story that still hits the mark even though it's not as strong as the animation, Mulan is successful.The story is not that different from the animation. Hua Mulan (Liu Yifei) is a woman who since her childhood (played by Crystal Rao when she was a child) is very active and often runs here and there, chasing a chicken up to the roof and breaking things around which annoys her village residents. and embarrassed her family because in those days a woman's only duty was to ""be quiet. Quiet. Graceful. Elegant. Polite.""Until one day when the Rounan tribe led by Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) and his companion who was a magician Xian Lang (Gong Li) invaded China. The Emperor (Jet Li) issued a decree requiring each family to include one male family member in the military and help withstand attacks from the Rounan Tribe.This is where the dilemma for Mulan begins. In her family only her father, Hua Zhou (Tzi Ma), was eligible. Her entire family consists of women, including her mother (Rosalind Chao) and younger sister (Xana Tang). But his father, a veteran, is now in a condition not fit for war, with one leg that cannot move freely and requires a cane to stand or walk.Mulan, knowing her father's condition did not allow her to join the war, sneaked out of her house at night, took her father's sword and armor, took a horse and left the house to disguise herself as a man and enlist in the army so that her father didn't need to register.With Mulan, director Niki Caro tries to stick to the heart of the story with his animated film version but also wants to make Mulan something new. That way he eliminates the musical element in this film. No longer do we hear the song ""Ill Make a Man Out of You"" when Mulan is practicing.Now Mulan is focusing more on every fighting action that I can say is quite exciting for a Disney film. Indeed there is no blood because this is a family film, even though the sword has pierced the chest or cut the neck, every choreography and every clank of the sword moves so smoothly and well that it makes every war action in the film quite grumpy.The film is also quite a sight to behold, with its grand royal exterior decor and colorful village interior. And also with the clothes of each character, from the clothes of the soldiers that look luxurious and also handsome, the clothes of the dark and intimidating Rounan warriors, to Mulan's own simple yet elegant clothes with dominant red. If these films are aimed at feasting on the eye, then I can gracefully say they did!But I felt an oddity in Mulan and it was the comedy element that was really off. No longer does the film feel as cheerful as its predecessor's animation. The atmosphere of the entire film feels really serious and dark, although there are a few times the characters try to crack jokes that seem half-baked.And that's what is lacking from this live-action film, because if we remember Mulan's animation, we know that the 1998 film managed to combine quite serious seriousness (such as the status of a woman who only acts as a male supporter) and comedy that makes the film feel light. and fun. Not with this film.But Mulan still managed to bring up a tough theme, touching on the topic that women can do what men can do, even better. And if these films were made with the aim of having a more serious tone, then they did. We will no longer sing along with the characters in it, but will be amazed at every jump, every slash and every run-on the wall which is certainly really fun.",Mulan

1312,idealismehati,"Great message, empty finale, lazy writings",4,8 September 2020,"Apperently removing the musical aspect instead becoming a brave move, turn out to be a dumb idea. There's a lot of point on the movie that will work out so much better with a song, and no doubt build the character development to a decent level at least. But no, they remove almost everything we know about Mulan (the sidekick, the interaction and especially the music) and instead gave us the typical cheap editing drama, not the disney show we are all paying forAt least, gotta admit, the message are good. The Disney rare cases where the girl saving the guys moment are well build, some of the background are stunning, the choreography get my high praise, but all the good thing immediately drown with the flat, soulless Mulan characters, a lazy writings antagonist and laughable finaleOnce again, this heavy budget remake fall into the same mistake they done on the previous Aladdin live action, by making the ending feel EMPTY and RUSHED so the plot can go on. (The worst ending by Disney live action remake so far)
Personally i don't mind the pace become more then 2 hours long, just to added more layer to the character so that the story at least will make senseThe original Mulan story, regardless on lack of a magical aspect, still shine on her own way with the most down to earth princess figure. But the remake itself has wasted a lot of potential of explaining that, and instead giving us with a try-hard mature movie to a childhood expecting audience, without any reason why we must loved this but not the older version of the masterpiece Mulan's 1998 who are the main reason people pay their big cash forBut we gonna accept what we got, and i'm disappointing again",Mulan

I've thought about writing a review for other movies but never have. In this case, I felt it was my duty to write my first review. This won't be much of a review but hopefully it will give some people a reason to give this movie a chance. For over a week, I held off on watching this movie because of the negative reviews. After not having very many other options and realizing that most of the negative comments were people comparing it to the story of Mulan that they know or saw in years past, I decided to put it on for Family Movie night. It was a pleasant surprise. My daughter, son, wife and I all watched it together and it kept all of our attention from start to finish, which is rare for a movie. I think my wife liked it the most because of the whole girl power thing and even clapped at the end but I also thoroughly enjoyed it. It was predictable but entertaining. I think people who fit into a similar demographic as me will also enjoy it so here is where I'm coming from....Black American male born and raised in the US, age 39, enjoy watching action movies, never watched any other version of Mulan (If i did see the animated version, I don't remember), didn't know the story of Mulan before watching this, watched this in 4k on an OLED TV",Mulan

2.The story that was too stiff this is happen because the soundtrack was bad, some bad dialogue and the most important theres no emotion in this film and make me boring for entire film3.Bad climax.

Anyway, we all have different tastes, so don't get discouraged by reading these negative reviews, you know your taste better than anyone else.I liked this one better than the original, since it's more my style of movies, especially since they added a great score, and no one singing around.

New Mulan is a great warrior from the beginning and thus this move her character (and plot) loses it's power and greatness. You can clearly see this in final battle - where Han doesn't stand a match to Mulan and writers create very stupid solution to force viewers that Mulan MUST uses her Wit to overcome Han and achieve victory.Despite losing plot and origin of story showed in animation years ago, this new creation has its own strength - it is beautiful show, with great fight sequences, superb acting and camera work, along with great music and epic battles. It's darker than animation. And it has Witch - which is at one side great character, and leading all existing events to render them pointless. But, Witch itself is extraordinary character - well played, greatly exposed and way to powerful!It could be piece of art - an extraordinary achievement, but writers overcomplicated it, made one but very important change to the origin and busted it.Compared to original Mulan I would give it 2/10

BUT....as much as i completely understood that Live action remake would take a different path to the story and have it's own color and had no expectation neither wanted to see the same animated movie, because live action is not a cartoon.....ME being a huge fan of Chinese culture from childhood, growing up watching movies, reading, following the culture... I SURELY expected to see some real passion put into making of this movie....Especially having the actress I wanted playing this legendary character.... SHE WAS GREAT IN EVERY ASPECT! BUT...As much as i loved it and my heart was warm....I also felt empty.... because of how much potential is lost in this picture....
I expected to feel closer to the actual legend of Mulan.... feel more history....accurately told....but it didn't happen.
still enjoyed it.... but having Yifei Liu being so great and strong in character i surely hoped for the directer to understand this story and it's real power more... because the actors GAVE IT ALL to what they had to work with.... so my 10 is to the CAST!",Mulan
1339,angelvaldric,Really bad movie *spoiler alert*,3,7 September 2020,"This has been one of the movies that completely wasted my time watching. I don't quite understand why it cost $200M, and so many aspects of this movie are wrong. Examples:
There is only 1 truly mass combat scene, and it is so boring. The editing focusing from the bigger fight to small individual fights was not smooth.Fight sequences were BAD. They likely did not spend $200M of their budget to hire a proper martial arts director. Instead of true martial arts fight sequences, they delivered straight-up westernized fighting which is likened to street fightingThe strength of the Rourans is consistent. At the start, they are this fearsome group of warriors that strike fear to their enemies. At the end, they were so weak that they couldn't even stand against a bunch of new recruits that did not even complete their military training fullyOverall editing is weak. The movie seems to be pieces of scenes merged haphazardly togetherThe entire culture aspect is JUST WRONG. I heard they used scriptwriters that were non-Chinese. Examples include the following: (1) Translation of the Chinese words on the sword was incorrect. Instead of ""Loyal, Brave, True"", which isn't exactly correct in terms of grammar, it should be ""Loyalty, Courage/Bravery, Truth'. (2) Which emperor wears GREEN??? This is ridiculous(3) No emperor ever leaves the city without soldiers. It is completely ridiculous.I feel like DIsney could have done a better job studying Chinese culture for a $200M movie, instead, they forsake proper research and settled with scriptwriters who do not know anything (ZERO) about Chinese culture.If you were to ask me what is good, really not much...

Mulan 2020 well worth it,8,6 September 2020,"I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that almost all of the low ratings and reviews are disgruntled folks that felt that they should not have to pay extra for a movie on their precious Disney +. This movie was always going to be in theaters first as a likely blockbuster then Blu-ray and digital ""then"" maybe a year later it would have ended up on Disney +. Add in the fact that the lead Lou Yifei was the subject of a boycott attempt because of statements she made regarding the unrest in Hong Kong and you have a recipe for unhappy pandemic reviews. Most of these might have not even actually watched the movie.
I found the movie to be extremely well done. It was powerful and uplifting. Go in to it with an open mind and you will likely enjoy it as much as I did. Seeing Donnie Yen & Jet Li was also cool. Have fun folks!",Mulan

If this is all the writers can come up with, then Disney is in big trouble. No newer Disney oroduction could measure up, but this is a new low. Empty dialogues without deeper meaning. Just phrases stringed together. Bad CGI effects, miss-matched colours, that have nothing with the time in which the story plays. All the writing and story and acting are a total lack of emotions.
An old chinese tale ruined.
Shame.",Mulan

Why would you want to watch the same scenes and hear the same lines you already know by heart. The ultimate plot doesn't change, but what they changed and how they presented her journey, was, in my eyes, perfect. I cried even more than with the original, lol.

I especially enjoyed the addition of Xianniang. Although this film differs from Aladdin in that it is not a musical and it takes on a much more kind of serious dramatic tone but all the while remaining thoroughly enjoyable for all ages.

Visually, the scenery resembles a computer background, the facial expressions are exaggerated and everything looks like a caricature. In terms of character development, there is none. Evil seeks revenge for his father, the good one wants to protect emperor, the soldier is loyal and the father is forgiving. Everything is flat as paper. The worst part is how women are treated. A Wife or A Witch. A woman without chi will not be equal to any man. A woman with chi will be subject to a superior man. It's just a disaster. I do not know who the target audience of the film is but hope they too will find it outdated and misogynist. It is unbelievable that this film was directed, produced and shot by women.",Mulan
1358,ivorbergmans,Rather watch the animated movie,4,24 December 2020,"If you start watching this movie to see an accurate live-action portrayal of the animated movie (like me), you will be disappointed. I can understand that the director needed to drop some of the elements of the original, as probably they wouldn't really work in live-action. However, what I don't understand is the big alterations that were made to the story itself. Changes that made the story worse, not better. Why skip the transformation of Mulan from woman to man, cutting off her hair? Why include a witch? Where did the exceptional music go? The opening sequence with Mulan running after a chicken on rooftops made me cringe too. I advice you to skip this one and watch the original animated movie instead!",Mulan
1359,Iczer1-225-70531,The key to enjoying this movie...,7,20 September 2020,"Before watching this movie, you must approach it as it's own version of a Chinese Legendary tale of Mulan and not the animated classic. Watch this movie with new eyes and you will find it to be quite entertaining. It has it's own take and is told via a much different style. I was looking forward to watching this when I first heard about it was keen to look at early reviews and noticed a pattern. People who hated it tended to keep comparing it to the animated version. The ones that liked it, tended to enjoy it for it's own merits. This allowed me to condition myself to forget that it is Disney telling the story and just watch. Honestly, it made a big difference. I like this best of all the live remakes Disney has done and it's the first one I went in not comparing. Plus it tells it with several different aspects from that of the animated version. The basic premise of the Chinese tale is in both versions but just told and expressed differently. I applaud this version and thought it to be well done. I purposely wrote this in such a way as to not spoil anything.",Mulan
1360,s3019653,Enjoy it as a stand alone film.,7,6 November 2020,"It is quite a good movie. There are a lot of negative reviews but those reviews seem to be expecting that it would be identical to the animated film. If they made it exactly the same the wouldn't be any point watching it. As long as you watch it with the understanding that it is a different story you can see it is very well done.
The film makers have decided for a more realistic style following the wuxia genre. There are some fantasy elements but a talking dragon wouldn't really make sense so I'm glad he was not included in this version.
The action is fairly limited. It is a shame to have superstar martial arts actors who didn't have much opportunity to demonstrate their skills. However I guess they wanted to keep it family friendly.",Mulan

I had not done any reading about the movie and never watched the animated version. I was pleasantly surprised though, as I had just watched Maleficent: Mistress of Evil a few weeks ago and wished there more movies like it I could watch. The two Maleficent movies were awesome and Mulan was much like them. If you liked Maleficent how could you not like Mulan? Plus it has kung fu! The chi concept is taught in most kung fu schools, harnessing your chi can create great strength. Most kung fu schools in the U.S. are different from
other martial arts schools, they pummel you for real! You have to be tough to
persevere in kung fu school. This is to answer the critics who wonder how she could have outfought larger male opponents.",Mulan
1370,ecgodon,Not for young children,10,6 September 2020,This Disney classic has a new spin- they geared it to older children and adults. It still had some of the Disney feel of the original movie yet it was a unique stand alone and was in my opinion a very good movie. It made women the Center of the plot for the good side and the bad side and it didn't make the story about how a woman needs a man. She came of age and chose her own path. Wonderful job! You simply can't compare it to the original- it's not the same movie. Mulan was always my favourite Disney movie and this one did not disappoint. There are a few minor things I would have changed as far as music went - but minor in the grand scheme of things. All and all I loved the movie.,Mulan

Plus, one thing this movie managed to get right was the pronunciation of Mulan's family name.The only part I found weird was the movement of the emperor's mouth when he was speaking. Besides that, the message of the importance of family and not giving up really hit home for me, and I believe that most people should be looking at these points of inspiration, especially during these troubling times.",Mulan
1378,delbertrose84,Best Live Action Disney Film Yet!!!!!!,10,4 September 2020,"I will say this to start!!! This is the best Live Action Disney Film based on an animated film that I have seen to date!!! It has action, drama, romance, fantasy, and Martial Arts!!!! I recommend everyone see this movie it is great for families. But let me say that this movie will push those boundaries of PG-13.
From here on is a spoiler stop here if you wish to remain in the dark.....From the opening scene until the final heart twisting end this movie is great. When she is chasing that chicken and showing off what she can do was great. The addition of Jason Lees Character and the ""Witch"" are great surprises in this film. There are many great actors in this film that and seeing several that I know from previous films and TV were a great shock to me as for the first time in a movies history I did not want to spoil anything about it before I personally got a chance to watch it.
The fighting scenes were well done!! They were both fantasy and real all blurred together. I have seen many Martial Arts films in my life and although this will never be called a Martial Arts film, it does have that feel about it without stepping to far away from the Disney feel. My final thoughts are this... this is what I image a live action version of animation being and I really hope that Disney looks to this as a new stepping point for movies of this nature!!!!!!",Mulan

1386,humantres,Avoid.,1,16 September 2020,"Absolute trash. Do yourself and your children a favor, stick to the original Disney classic. The original animation had it all: drama, humor, great soundtrack and a likeable cast of characters. You cared for Mulan. A woman born into a patriarchal society who made the decision to disguise herself as a man in order to save her disabled father from going to war. She did this for the honor of her family, which is a foreign concept to most of us in the West.Through the film she struggled. 2020 Mulan gave her character superpowers essentially. In the original, she was no warrior. She was never trained and had no ""secret chi powers"" to speak of. At one point, she was kicked out of training and told she was unteachable. Instead of giving up, she rallied back and proved her strength. 2020 Mulan has NONE of this. She's overpowered from the start. He only struggle is attempting to hide the fact that she's outright on another level from her male peers.2020 Mulan strips away everything that made the original film a timeless classic. Modern day Disney is a soulless joke. A hollowed out husk of a once great and innovative company. One again I say, stick to the original animations. Not just of Mulan but of every Disney classic. Your kids will thank you. You'll thank yourself.",Mulan

The only thing remotely entertaining about this movie are the visuals and gorgeous landscapes, but these are not enough to save it from itself. The wooden, cheesy acting, the hit-you-over-the-head-obvious symbolism at every turn (we get it, Mulan is the phoenix that rises from the ashes), the lack of musical score... it was all so terrible.

Here? We have simply nothing, a bland and boring story with main character being so bloody unrealistic that you don't really care what will happen next because it's obvious that everything will be fine in the end.Don't waste your money on this thing.

Villains were turned from fierce bloodthirsty army into black Naruto style magician ninjas (they literally run vertically up the wall) who look like assassins.
The longer I was watching the more ridiculous film become with sudden character changes, non logical plot points, absolutely horrible ""final boss"" fight and changed ending that undermines the whole point that Mulan was trying to make.

About the lead actress what if she's from wuhan anyway... She's still good at acting. Dont be biased..,Mulan
1409,jeff_dutton,Basic,1,4 January 2021,It was so basic. No character development fight scenes were corney they rushed every scene. And half way thru there was a narrator. So basic,Mulan
1410,zharmon,Great visuals - not a lot of depth,4,8 September 2020,"Stunning visuals in this movie, however the story lacked depth. I couldn't relate to it culturally could be why. Lots of really corny scenes that seem so weird. Very much Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. I think it will do well in China. I think it was made for China.",Mulan
1411,johnbadion,Not what you'd expect but still a powerful tale,7,5 September 2020,"People who disregard this adaptation of Mulan express the lack of music and Mushu but honestly take it for what it is. It is a retelling of the original Mulan tale (not the animated movie) and for what it is it's a pretty good movie but obviously not as good as the animated one. And before you watch this movie just take into account that this is NOT a retelling of the animated movie. And if you can get past the lack of mushu, music, and Mulan basically being a badass from the start then it's a pretty good movie. (Still not worth the $30 bucks) but otherwise I'd recommend",Mulan
1412,knnalke,Different but Worthy,7,9 September 2020,"It is not the same Mulan movie that I grew up watching but seems more geared towards the culture for which it is trying to portray. Definitely worth watching and would recommend, but you have to go in with an open mind and not expect it to be the live action cartoon.",Mulan
1413,avera-25862,Great fighting and rendition of movie,8,7 September 2020,There are many versions of Mulan that exist. Glad Disney was able to release live action movie that looks at other Mulan versions and focus on metaphors vs. talking animals.,Mulan
1414,AdmiralFrank,A visually pleasant remake with a lame script,4,22 December 2020,"I agree that a movie should be analyzed based on its own merits. But, calling it ""Mulan"" and following closely the original plotline makes this rather difficult. Besides, that would certainly NOT have been the case had the movie been any better...Because, unfortunately, this was a poorly WRITTEN movie. The acting, costumes, and photography were good or very good. But all that effort was made useless because of a script which seems to have been written by an intern anxious to satisfy its boss, who in turn was eager to please a board of directors. The result? An insipid, incoherent movie.Indeed, there are many issues with the script. First, the characters are cartoonish (pun intended): we don't even know Mulan's favorite combat weapon. Second, their motivations are shallow and obscure. Why does the witch, after a life of hatred, suddenly decides to sacrifice herself in order to help Mulan, and thus preserving the statu quo? We'll never know. Third, the dialogs are dull and plain. We're talking Kung fu movie of the 1970s level of dullness: the same phrases are said time and again as if hoping that by sheer repetition they will gain deeper meaning.But the script's fifth issue is, by far, the worst: poor worldbuilduing. Examples are aplenty; I'll only take the three most egregious. ONE, the ""chi"". What is THIS? C'mon dude! This is not Star Wars! TWO: combat dynamics. It doesn't make sense, any of it. Unlocking your ""chi"" makes you a great warrior, yet all training is standard, unrelated to ""chi"". Another: A nomad tribe having siege weapons to attack an army? Dude! This is not Age of Empires! And in one scene we see said siege weapon aim mercilessly to its target, and the next one it misses the target by, like a mile. Another: The Imperial City whole garrison is summoned to a courtyard; how many are they? Fifty-something guys. And last: the Emperor is some sort of ""chi"" powerhouse, yet the antagonist doesn't seem to understand any of it; kinda weird and disbalanced, isn't it? I've left he last example of poor worldbuilding for the end: THIRD, the Phoenix. No one seems to care about this guy, except for the CGI dptmt. Was the Phoenix real or Mulan's imagination? Did it have any powers or was it just a glorified cheerleader? Does it have anything to do with ""chi""? We'll never know.All in all, the had good source material, and good actors and technicians to execute it nicely, but the script conspired against all these efforts.",Mulan
1415,IYANN_,It was nice,9,21 September 2020,"I've read some negative reviews about this show, and I really don't understand why they hate it. All I ever read are articles about irrelevant political drama concerning the actress, ""historical/folklore inaccuracies"", and their biased judgement towards the cartoon.I think people get too fixated on the idea that the live-action would religiously follow the cartoon, which it did to some extent but added their own ""twist and concepts"", which apparently, most likely triggered people who went watching the film with the wrong mindset. Coming from a casual movie watcher, who doesn't really care about anything but simply interested for some good casual story-telling, action, and visuals, I think it's an enjoyable watch, it's your average action film that follows a historical setting with a storyline influenced by the original cartoon to an extent.It's a great film to watch on your family movie day, or whatever. People just expected too much due to the original being such a worldwide recognized Disney title throughout the years, and let's be honest, any film for that matter that tries to compete, or borrows the plotline from a popular title never really succeeds because we all have these biased viewers who passionately loved the original and their way of judging is tainted by their one-sided influence - and of course, you really can't take any original out of its throne when it has been a part of everyone's childhood.Bias criticisms, inaccuracies to whatever, and an actress's political opinion, what does that have to do anything with the film? Mulan is a fantasy action film based on a Chinese legend, from action to the art, whether or not that was portrayed accurately, that doesn't give a show a major flaw. The flow of the film was great and wasn't severely rushed, the cinematography, and action sequences were obviously done well, the prop aesthetics, animations, and effects were pleasant to my eyes as an Artist. Of you course you could say, ""Don't make a film, if it won't follow the original sources accurately."" But this is what western directing is for you, they always change and modify original concepts, but that doesn't mean it makes something inevitably bad.Mulan is an entertaining movie with a strong common message. I love action, I love historical-fantasy, and you should give this a watch, and don't waste your time reading negative reviews like what I just did 2 hours ago before watching the film because they are all ""cringe"" and only have 1 goal, to review bomb a film out of pure hatred. I went watching this show to find out what to hate about, and all I was left was being entertained and reminded about certain virtues while questioning what is there to hate about exactly? People just love to nitpick and complain to stir up unnecessary drama, and the negative feedback about this film shows that.Enjoy.",Mulan
1416,coreleonedk,This isn't the cartoon guys!,7,5 December 2020,"Nor is the cartoon the 'original'. The cartoon and this live action-movie, are two seperate interpretations of the 1.700 years old legend of Hua Mulan. So stop wishing for this to be a remake of the cartoon, because it's not.By not being a remake, we are spared from the talking dragon, the songs and the profoundly stupid romance. Instead this one delivers beautiful cinematography and action-sequences made for an adult audience (people actually dies on screen in this one).It's certainly not the masterpiece of the century, but it is no way as bad, as the reviewers in here wants you to think it is.Judge it on its own premises, and stop wanting it to be a remake, of something that never was 'the original' in the first place.",Mulan
1417,blinkar,"Great action, and expanded on the original",9,10 September 2020,"This version of Mulan not only told the same story as it's predecessor but expanded it and made it more realistic. There are many versions of this legend and this incorporates many of them. If you were expecting a shot-for-shot remake this is not it. Boy am I glad it's not (Sorry not sorry lion king fans). I just don't see the purpose of making these remakes if they're the exact same thing. This is why Mulan, like many of the other successful titles, meets and exceeds my expectations. It still tells the story we all knew and loved, but expands not just the main character but the supporting cast in regards to their motives. The music was there, in spirit as you could hear it in the background. The characters didn't break into song, and it was intentional. It would be really weird to see an action scene with battles and killing and then just have the characters break into songs and ballads. To which I applaud the direction they went in by sticking to what the style of the movie was meant to be.",Mulan
1418,mrrjohansson,"""Different"" adaption of Mulan",5,26 December 2020,"I expected more.. The movie is OK, accorded to its own interpretation of the legend of mulan, but this adaption is nothing like the animated story from 1998. Unfortunately that's the saga of the legend I build my expectation around. Barely no soundtrack but Aguileras Reflection, and I found the music in the animated movie (yet in my own country audio) and thats another disappointing thing. Maybe harsh, this isn't a reboot like Lion King etc.. so maybe I should review this review as a independent movie",Mulan

It was so moving and the cast portrayed this in such a delicate and loving way. Alongside that, It's always great to see women stand up for themselves against those who belittle them. Overall I thought It was an enjoyable watch that makes you feel a little something in your heart.The negative reviews are pretty much brought on due to politics & preset expectations that the movie is bad due to the difference between live and animated versions.Though, I feel that it bears many similarities to the animated version. What the critics missed is how they varied in certain ways. Mushu was not there in the form of dragon but in the form of a phoenix. His purpose was to look after Mulan throughout the journey after being told to do so by the ancestors, this is exactly what the phoenix did. It helped her in times of need. Phoenix & dragon go hand in hand in the Chinese culture which I think is beautiful because when combined, the movies possess the Yin and Yang. As for the Prince Charming, he appears as a friend who took the first step to stand up for Mulan when no one else did.",Mulan
1422,william_crossland,What the hell Disney,1,7 September 2020,What are you doing Disney Seriously. Would not even guess this was Mulan not for a second. I was not expecting a screen for screen representation of the Original but come on. You removed beloved characters changed her ancestors and didn't even have a single song in it. It didnt feel like a Disney movie even not in the slightest maybe a second rated kung foo movie at best. Dont even get me started on witch craft and spells. Disney you have totally missed the mark.,Mulan

I have wonderful memories seeing it in the theater as a child and upon rewatching it recently, had my positive opinion of it reinforced. With that being said, I don't think it's a good idea to compare the new Mulan to the original, just because they are different styles of movies (animated vs live action) and they are both great in different ways.I thought the actress who played Mulan did a wonderful job and brought a lot of charisma to the role. The entire cast did well and I enjoyed many of their performances. The soundtrack was also very nice and included a few themes from the animated movie which I loved. The story was moving and I appreciated many of the decisions of the writers and production team.

1428,samarrandale,Refreshing retelling to an iconic film.,8,4 September 2020,"I enjoyed this film so so so much. Instead of being a copy-and-paste animation to live action Disney remake, this rendition of Mulan is a totally refreshing retelling of the original. The storyline follows a similar narrative, yet it takes a grittier and more action-packed approach, showing breathtaking cinematography throughout the journey. A new addition to the movie, *villainess* Bori Khan, is a 'reflection' of women with power, same with Mulan, and the film shows how differently it implements their place in society. The GIRL POWER moment that they both join forces, although it is cheesy, is a great lesson for young audiences.
There are a fair few rough spots and *eye roll* moments, but I'm thrilled to see a Disney live action remake finally take on its own course, instead of regurgitating their originals. Thoroughly enjoyed.",Mulan
1429,fred-65856,Amazing movie !,9,14 December 2020,"I just dont understand the childish ignorants who put 1 out of 10... People are getting ridiculous and complain about everything in life. This was a great movie. I did see the first Mulan when I was and kid and this isnt a remake. This one is its own movie and has is own character. Get over it. If people keep spitting on Disney for no reason then they will just cut the production on the movie production. People are becoming ungrateful... are living like kings and have zero respect and gratitude. I hope you dont treat you close ones like that.Anyways, awesome movie ! I loved every moment of it. Beautiful vivid colors and alot of attention to small details, which looked incredebly good in 4k HDR. Costumes were amazing and items such as weapons were very well made. Special effects were also very well done and I think it was just the right amount. Sometimes this genra of movie contains a littlebit too much of it but not this one. Also, characters are deep, they evolve through the story. I think the actors were fantastic. The main actors really made me feel their emotions. There is also a great sense of camadery in the platoon. It also contains the right amount of humor to give you a good laft every now and then. The 2 main antagonist are very different one from the other. One is intriguing and makes us feel empathy for her situation once we get to know her. She is a Pretty good Antagonist in my opinion. But the other one is kind of weak and could have been written better. Thats my only negative.So overall my experience was great. I had a very good time watching the movie and would definetely recommend it to my family and friends !",Mulan

Mulan has always been my favorite Disney film and I believe that this film deserves more credit then is currently given.Unlike other Disney adaptations, Mulan (2020) took its own form away from the original film, making it unique and a film in its own right. The storyline was entertaining, and there were occasional and subtle references to the original film for those who have watched the original. The film took a beautiful twist, and even though there was no singing in the film, the soundtrack was beautiful.I would definitely suggest not listening to the overly harsh reviews and just giving it a watch!",Mulan
1433,AkiriNim,So disappointed,3,3 October 2020,I loved the 1998-Mulan and really looked forward to this movie after seeing the trailer. I don't think I've ever been so disappointed with a movie.The 1998-Mulan was about a normal woman who took her fathers place in the army because she loves him. Through hard work she becomes a skilled soldier and through her quick thinking she ends up saving China.In this movie she seems to be some unique one in a million woman who is awesome at fighting without much training. This is just so disappointing in itself. Furthermore it feels like the primary reason for taking her fathers place is some sort of self-realization. And then there's the underdeveloped and forced relations that just doesn't feel natural at all. Even most of the battle scenes ended up annoying me with their whole ignore gravity thing going on.,Mulan

Cons- everything else
Let's be honest, this movie wasn't trying to be realistic. They just wanted to please the Chinese money that paid for this terrible film! The film looks cheap, the acting is pandering and just awful. They take a beloved animated movie and ruin it. They claim to want realism, apparently chi is real, and so is running up walls, turning into birds and shape shifting lol. The thing that made the animated film so amazing was Mulan going from a clumsy, insecure, but smart girl to a strong, secure and empowering female lead! The scene that has Mulan use her brains to climb and retrieve the arrow is brilliant! Wasn't in the movie... Forget not having a funny dragon to lighten the mood, every scene except for two are serious and over acted.",Mulan
1436,jeanineklimach,Just...Bad...,1,20 September 2020,"I won't compare this to the original 1998 Disney Mulan since the people involved made it clear early on that they were going for something different. So I judged this film on its quality as a stand-alone film.
This movie is just bad in every way. From a juvenile script, jarring edits, unaesthetic wire work, and obvious plot holes that would bore even a young child. It's was dull, unimpactful, and clear that they had minimal direction. 20 minutes into the film and I was already looking at the clock.
Now, a good film doesn't have to wow with incredible effects and skill, quite the opposite. It's been proven many times that even a lackluster looking film or even bad effects can be overlooked if there is a good story. This film didn't even have that.
Another issue I had with it is it seems that the film makers pawned off other Chinese Mulan live action adaptions. Not just because the story is the same, but all the way from set design, character design, and even shot angles were the same (eg. 2009 Mulan film by Jingle Ma - watch it btw, it's better in every way).
Overall, this movie has nothing special. It's completely bland in every way. And that's not even the most frustrating part - the most obscene is that they are actually promoting this as something great, something inspiring, when it doesn't even try. Just like Mulan herself in this film - doing virtually nothing to earn respect but still expecting our praise.",Mulan

Also the 3 words (Loyal, Brave, and True) were repeated many times, it's very cliche. But actually, I enjoyed this movie. At least the scene where Mulan's sister was scared of the spider when Mulan's matchmaker time was quite funny. I was laughing on that. Haha... And the horse still the same like the animated one.
The scenery was pretty great! The culture and the places was also great. It will be better if they added songs, dragon Mushu, and didn't added The Witch.

The training montage were rubbish and movie seemed to jump from beautiful set to beautiful set with out anything tying them together.

1457,cynaomhan,Just bought the premium acces...,10,30 September 2020,I couldn't wait until December. And I was not disappointed. It was everything I expected it to be with a cast that included the legendary Jet Li and Donnie Yen. Perfect. The beginning is definitely what made it great. I love the back story they added. Heck yeah it was corny. But definitely a good corny.Side note...I came to the conclusion that these live action movies of the Disney Vault greats are meant to cater more to the generation that grew up with them. It only makes sense. We're all grown up now.I also love the fact that they included the Mandarin version of Mulan's theme song in the end credits.I think it honored the roots of Chinese martial art films. One of the reasons I really liked it. Only thing it was missing? The out of sync lip movement to English words.,Mulan

1461,psychhelp,Doesn't have the Asian soul.,5,10 September 2020,"The film is laden with cliched concepts without accounting for daily life dynamics, and honestly an overkill.

1466,chancejensen,Nothing special,3,7 September 2020,"Nothing ground breaking. look at it as distinct from the animated movie and your given a bland action movie with a bit of women power that seems a bit rushed. Honestly this movie would've been better if it was about the witch! If you didn't know about Mulan the whole opening scene and first appearance of the witch makes you feel like the movie is about her.Now comparing it to the animated movie, it is a remake after all.It's awful. All the characters you love are pushed in the back or are gone. Her army buddies become everything wrong with men, the Phoenix replacement for Mushu does nothing, and it's just a hollow remake. While they tried for original over something like the Lion King remake (which wasn't live action at all) it just came across as not very well defined. I couldn't decide if it wanted to be an army movie, or a generic feeling Asian action movie. For all the calls that it was going to be a unique movie it followed the story of Mulan and didn't differ from the main story. Lazy writing, poor character development, and don't get me started on the magic...",Mulan

It is very different from the original and has more similarities to the original Chinese story, but I'm glad that it was different because it does what a good remake does, that doesn't just shot for shot remake the original like The Lion King remake does. Though the reason I only gave it a 7 was because its just one of Disney's cash grab remakes and doesn't have any passion put into he making of it.Overall its my 2nd favorite Live-Action remake from Disney behind Aladdin 2019",Mulan

This was a brilliant movie with a beautiful and strong message.
It was entertaining, a great story and carried really well. It's not the be compared to an animated version because this was a movie of its own.If you can watch a Disney movie without the expectation of a musical sequence in every other scene and talking animals then this movie is fantastic. However the negative reviews, as I'm sure you can read for yourself are in the majority from people mad that this wasn't a sequence - sequence remake of the animated Mulan and that it didn't have nice songs and funny talking animals.",Mulan

You never have high expectations for disney live action; you're suppose to be pleasantly surpluses by how well they end up making it. But this time around, they failed horribly. No character development. No love between mulan and fellow soldiers. And worst of all.. Hollywood's need to check off every box of the liberal agenda ruined the movie. It's already an empowering storyline, why do you have to go over the top to make it less genuine???",Mulan

The acting is good each character played fine.
Mulan herself is strong and confident and a great role model for inspiration.
Cinematography was very good with the landscapes however some scenes such as the pots falling in slow mo seemed a bit off but great job all round.
It has a great message about standing up against social problems / inequality.
Action scenes were entertaining and excited some of the moves like the huns running on the walls was weird but most scenes were well done.
Music was nice and reminiscent of the original.The Bad Stuff:
Most complaints are that it doesn't have the songs or mushu, however the original was offensive to the chinese audience.The pricing as well is overpriced $35? You can see a movie at the cinema for $15 and that's on top of a subscription.Overall:
I didn't have a problem with the movie it's a solid 7 personally and 8 for me. This is my first ever movie review, go easy on me 😅",Mulan
1473,purpledrosophila,What was this dumpster fire?,2,11 April 2021,"I adore the original ""Mulan"" and it's one of my favorite movies of all time. So, I really tried to give this movie a fair chance. They made Mulan a special snowflake, with no real internal conflict. The heart of the Mulan story, including the original fable, is that she was not special: she was a normal person taking huge risks and making sacrifices to protect her family, serve her country, and do the right thing. The live action Mulan just had to rediscover that she was special. Sigh. It was boring, humorless, and had no heart. This was an insult to the empowering narrative of the original story, whether in animated movie or written form. Some of the visuals were okay, and there was a single joke about makeup that got a chuckle from me, and that's the only reason I didn't give this a 1.",Mulan

Regardless, I thought the movie was great. First you have Asian actors speaking in English and you can already tell it isn't their first language. Second, the fight scene was good but every one is expecting this great action film when this is still a Disney film. It still follows the animation's story line but it was great in its own way. I liked that the eagle was a character because it was a good transition. Yes, I'm bummed Mushu wasn't an actual character but a Phoenix was good as well, to symbolize her as a warrior. I wanted more Donnie Yen action and I absolutely loved that the emperor played a fighting role. I also wished Donnie Yen was her love interest, but oh well. It was a good movie!",Mulan

Not playing the original movie's theme songs eliminated the charm of the movie. Changing the character which Mulan falls in love with is heartbreaking.
If the director wanted to put a twist in the new movie, adding the witch would be enough. There was absolutely no need to modify most of the events of the original movie.

Yes, they could have done a little more in character development and detail in some parts of the movie, but overall, it was a good movie to watch as a family. I've read some of the other mixed and negative reviews. I think people are going in with too many expectations with its affiliation with Disney and the prior animated movie, and just aren't giving this movie a fair chance to be its own artistic interpretation. My seven year old watched it with me and loved it and would have given it a ten. He didn't go in with any expectations. He walked away understanding the message of the story and that women can be powerful heroes and earn respect and position for their accomplishments, and with some insight and appreciation for Chinese history and virtues. While he wasn't a critic of other minor inaccuracies here and there, he did pick up on the fact that there was fighting and death but no blood. I told him, it is Disney after all.",Mulan

There is no comedy, no singing, none of the same characters except Mulan, and rather than her having to struggle to ""become a man"" she just has magical powers that she just simply decides to use.

But, for some reason and busy life, I never got chance to watch the cartoon version of Mulan. My wife is a fan of cartoon Mulan and was excited about this movie. So, watched it together.I am a guy who loves high quality movies, I was just amazed by this movie and story. I liked how they showed the whole story. The father's Love brought tears in my eyes. The acting was good. The direction and story telling was very nice. I was shocked looking at IMDb rating, because I think it deserves an average of atleast 8/10. I think people the comparing with there childhood cartoon. They should realize this movie has some different writers and directors. Every movie maker has there own version. Every batman movie is different. The cartoon Mulan is also one version of another story teller.Tobe honest I loved this movie, it deserves more appreciation. If you can see from a neutral point of view, you will see the movie team did a great job! I feel sorry for them because they can not release this good movie in theatre due to corona.I don't want to convince someone to like it or not.

1487,edoyhong,Review from a Chinese Person,9,5 September 2020,"Frankly, I thought this was pretty good and many of you are missing the point of this movie. While I have read some valid critiques, some are just nonsensical.I understand that there was no Mushu or there were no songs. Trust me, I do wish they were incorporated, but this movie was mainly to show the Chinese culture, while also still enacting the central plot from the animated adaption of the film. It was to show our heavy family values, some of our customs, etc. I enjoyed this because it was different than the animated film, and different does not mean bad. I will admit this movie was geared more towards more international markets, especially in China and other Asian countries, but the point of this movie was to highlight beauty of Chinese culture and values, which I hope you guys can appreciate.Is this movie perfect? Not at all. But I would say I am proud to have this movie as a representation of Chinese people. I know that they swayed away from the animated adaption, but you should not let that deter you from not enjoying it. I think it may be hard to watch it as a non-Chinese person, but try to enjoy it (despite its hefty price).",Mulan
1488,jobapplications,Missed some important key parts,4,5 September 2020,"So ive watched Mulan and despite being on the edge of my seat at the end, there are some weaknesses. Mainly in recognition of what her character does Her efforts in training aren't rewarded as she simply does it because of her special inner force. Even when she completes the training task a.k.a removing the arrow from the top of the tower in the cartoon (its different in the movie). The only people to notice are her fellow soldiers, her commander is absent.
Similarily in the battle scene later no one witnesses her basically make the enemy retreat all by herself. Yet somehow after this period of no one noticing her worth. They all conclude she is the best of them all and decide she should save the emperor. It makes you wonder if the director actually watched the orginal.
All this being said it was a rewardable viewing experience though its clearly been ovepriced by disney and ive yet to see a positive review based on this price point..",Mulan

Whether or not you've seen and loved the animated Mulan of the 1990's I can imagine you falling head over heels for this splendid family adventure that empowers not only women but children in general to follow their hearts and engage in imaginative, heroic, adventure. Director Niki Caro has made a stunningly beautiful film, with dazzling colors and rich detail in every frame.

They present Mulan as the ""chosen one"" and so everything pretty much falls in her favour. This film was not enjoyable to watch, I really wanted to like it but it's so inferior to the classic it's frustrating. I loved the classic, and I know the director said she wanted to make it more realistic by cutting out Mushu but she still includes mystical characters and flamboyant fight scenes (that were very unrealistic). Why cut out what made the classic so enjoyable? The film doesn't have the strong impact the classic has, they skim over important moments and Mulan barely grows throughout the film. While they try to present some good lessons, they gloss over all of these important moments and so you really don't feel anything during this movie except frustration. The villains aren't menacing and make the stupidest choices that favor the protaganist. The characters who you know are meant grow into close friends are all awkward and don't seem close at all. And somehow the film just drags on - it felt like forever to get through. I'm not saying it should have had musical numbers or Mushu, but they had the opportunity to present a great Chinese tale about female empowerment yet somehow created a boring film that lacks impact, creativity and strong direction.",Mulan

You have colorful environments filled with unique architecture, clothing and people that create a vagrant living world. The battles are well rehearsed with the camera team capturing all the juicy overpowered fightingmoves.However, what killed the joy of this movie for me was the story. It's filled with plotholes. Every single struggle, every single obstacle is avoided or handled with deus ex machinima. Meaning that in every scenario there's a lucky occurrence that somehow creates the PERFECT scenario for Mulan to easily do whatever is necessary. To use an example that's not in the movie and doesn't spoil the storyline: If Mulan would've had to assassinate an enemy commander in a camp filled with hundreds of elite soldiers, trained from childhood.

1505,KevinWithCrocs,Live Action Remakes are Terrible,2,5 September 2020,"Every character was one dimensional. When there were scenes of tension, trying to manipulate the audience to care about someone or the plot, they fail because we as an audience do not care about the people we're watching.I just didn't care about the characters and there was no tension; no one had a clear motivation or rather, their motivation was bland and uninteresting. Everyone was forgettable instead of Mulan because that's the title of the film. The movie gave little to none scenes in order to flesh out the characters; they tried but failed at giving everyone their unique characteristics and a reason on why they're together as ""friends"". Stated once more, I just didn't care about who I was watching due to said reasoning. On another note, almost everything was poorly executed such as the editing, use of camera movement during action scenes and dialogue scenes, the script, CGI, acting, and the overall plot. Most of the actions scenes were quickly cut. And for a film involving Donnie Yen and Jet Li (although they're fairly old now) they were extremely under utilized for any action scenes. For action of itself, there was no long takes or even 5 second take to give the actions scenes any impact or any importance. Also, the use of slow-motion during the fight scenes were tiresome after the first time in use. Onto another subject, personally, I would've enjoyed if the dialogue were to be presented in Chinese (pardon for my ignorance for not knowing the correct phrasing for the Chinese dialect) in order to give that authenticity due to movie being live action with heavy Eastern-Asia influences. The themes the movie tried to explore were poorly executed and not impactful at all.Something that I can give credit where credit is due is the use of the abundant extras, set designs, clothing, and how the movie wasn't a shot for shot remake similar to the original movie.Overall the movie felt like is was just marking checks into the check box. I felt no passion or care while watching. I can acknowledge that they at least tried but every attempt in order to be different or add something new to the table fails in every attempt.",Mulan

1509,bellechu,I love this movie and why,10,5 September 2020,"I enjoyed the movie a lot and watched it twice in one night. There are a few reasons why I love it so much1. First, it was well directed to show the struggles of being a woman during that period. For example, Mulan was told to hide her ""chi"", which simply meant her potential to be a good warrior since she was little.

Second, the movie brought attention to the value of love of your family, being true to yourself and your friends, and loyal to your country. They are all very important values for life and you hardly see any movies that talk about all of them well. It's a good movie to watch with your kids.3. Third, I think Disney did a great job casting each role. The actress selected to play Mulan has the type of beauty which appeals to both the east and the west. And she has a martial arts background. She did well in all the fight scenes. All the other characters they selected also fit well and were made vivid. I adored Mulan's father. He played the mix feelings of being happy for her daughter's talent but also worried about her not being accepted by society. I am also very impressed by Bori Khan. He looks exactly like the Bori Khan, I imagined.My suggestion is to watch this movie without comparing it to the animated version. Luckily I already forgot that version since it was a long time ago. Mulan has been a famous story for centuries in Chinese history. The actual recorded story is very short. Basically, it only mentioned a woman named Mulan who replaced her father to fight a war since she had no brothers and her father was aging. Due to how short the story is, a lot is left to the imagination for whoever wants to tell the story. I personally think it's great that Disney made the second movie different from the first one. If they made it exactly the same, i'm not sure i would want to pay to watch just a live action version.Overall, I enjoyed the movie a lot. If you have two people watch movie together, $29.99 is a reasonable price. I had two others watch movie with me and we watched it twice, so it's actually cheaper than paying for movie tickets.",Mulan

First, it was well directed to show the struggles of being a woman during that period. For example, Mulan was told to hide her ""chi"", which simply meant her potential to be a good warrior since she was little. However, when she changed her identity to that of a man, her strong ""chi"" suddenly brought her a lot of recognition and compliments. The movie was directed well to show this contrast.2.

I wouldn't be able to sit through the new one beyond this first viewing. I didn't like the over emphesis on feminism aspect. I thought it was OTT. The original film just made it look effortless it wasn't even about that it was just a girl that wanted to save her father. She didn't want to be soldier she just wanted to save her father and in order to do that she became soldier. Where as this film was totally opposite..this film lacked depth, also Mulan in the original had beautiful, funny, out of the box personality which is why she was different to the rest of the women and that is why she struggled to find her place. This Mulan just seemed too serious her personality was boring, and it was only her talent in chi that made her out of place not her personality. The film lacks the joyful journey, the humour, the team work, and companionship that was in the original. I gave it 4 stars as the cinematography, sets, costumes etc were good.",Mulan

I feel nothing but confusing when I saw this movie.What the most confused me is 'Qi'. I just could not figure out what the hell 'Qi' is even after I finished the whole movie. It sounds like 'the one', you know, reminding me of Neo in Matrix. I guess maybe the director would like to use some elements of traditional Chinese culture as a clue, but it didn't work.

There is nearly any good interaction between them. Even 'Mulan' gets little screen time, even though she is supposed to be the leading role.

1536,thomasmat-26521,Decent but not Disney,4,16 September 2020,"The movie on its own felt like a standard action movie of the last 10 years. Little plot or character development with big budget action and visual effects. It was entertaining and the ratings would be higher if it wasn't an attempted re-make.As a live action adaptation of a favorite Disney movie it completely missed the mark. Mushu wasn't realistic enough but a teleporting sorceress that has no ties to anything in the movie was? They are obviously assuming you have seen the original because there are no relationships built among Mulan's family or warrior comrades. Making you feel very little after finishing the film. The script must of only been 50 pages long, which is mind blowing considering how much substance and humor the 98' version had. Passable movie but didn't feel like Disney or Mulan.",Mulan
1537,nhorrocks-41374,Doesn't matter,1,18 September 2020,"What happened to the savage Mushu that we all loved and also made part of Mulan what is was for us? Disney had made a live action of Maleficent which slightly differed from Auroras story and told more about Maleficent but still was telling Arouras story and it stayed relevant but felt new. If you want to take liberty in trying to change things with a live action you can do so, but when you completely strip the live action and make it into something that has only the main human characters have in common with the original cartoon (except for Shang, what the hell leaving out a great guy like him!?) that is when you need to go back to the drawing board and restart it. You guys took everything we loved about Mulan and threw it away like it never existed. You need to keep things relevant and try to keep in the highest notes that made the cartoon such a success. Plus the animated was a musical the most top song that everyone knows (whether by memes or the cartoon) from this epic cartoon is making a man out of you. This movie can be compared to if you made a live action for Beauty and the Beast stripped it of its musical and loveable story and turned it into a horrifying slasher horror movie.",Mulan

So don't go into th movie expecting that A lot of reviews are upset that their childhood is ruined by this version. It's a different movie, and it should be reviewed as such. Disregard the ratings and reviews about people complaining about how the movie isn't like the cartoon and give the movie itself a view. The cinematography and effects are besutiful; the action is intense, and the message is there. Sadly very few people get that. The movie becomes a target for people who want to complain. Find the right in this movie. Of course it's violent and mystical. It's about a warrior. While I didn't think it was worth the $34 price tag to stream, it definitely excelled in the remake category. If your childhood enjoyed the cartoon version, then watch that instead. This version definite captivates new viewers who are unfamiliar with the story.

1540,eaamckenzie,A Parents Review,3,20 September 2020,"Good points:
The acting/actors were talented.
The fight scenes were done nicely.
Overall graphics and appearance of the movie were good.Bad points:
-The movie plot seemed to fall between trying to be more of a serious film rather than a remake of a children's movie. This left me feeling like Disney didn't cater to the right target audience.
The movie was missing some the songs and characters that made the original movie so memorable for fans.This movie explores sexuality in ways that could be confusing to younger viewers. Mulan seems to have an attraction to one of the guys in the camp, but she is dressed as a man. They have a strange exchange in one of the camp scenes. These types of innuendos were not out rightly explored in the original movie. Also at the end that same guy says to Mulan once he finds out she is a woman at the end ""so you still won't hold my hand"". Then there is another character, depicted first as a man but then she morphs into a woman and a bird. In one of the initial scenes the woman is seen overthrowing a blanket with rainbow colored dyes.The Chinese culture and the dishonor themes may been seen as offensive to Chinese people because they seemed to be overly exaggerated and sometimes and wasn't depicted well. For example when Mulan was dressed in her traditional makeup for the match maker, her makeup was terrible (which I'm sure it was supposed to be) but if you were to see a true depiction of this formal Chinese attire I think it's really a beautiful way of dress and makeup. The way they made Mulan look was dishonoring of the culture. They literally just threw paint on her face it was so ugly.",Mulan
1541,lucasdelaluna,It's annoyingly ok...,4,21 September 2020,"So I just watched the new Mulan movie, and I gotta say it's surprisingly decent. It's not the best I would not recommend watching it if your looking for an action packed, funny story , filled with happy characters. If you wanna watch a disney life action remake you shouldn't watch this.
Now on to the bad stuff about this movie.
So I'm kinda mad that mushu wasn't in the movie, because first of all they tried to make it « more realistic, » Yeah, you made it more realistic by adding in a flying bird witch thing, and also added Mulan having this cook super power with the hole Chi thing...
Like Disney, come on. If your gonna make it realistic don't add Magic Witches, Moving carpets, wall running (no joke they ran on the walls, not like running sideways, they ran on the walls,) And of course the stupid arrow catching.

1546,christopherl-52784,Tweaking a Winning Formula is Never a Good Thing,2,21 October 2020,"When I first heard that a live action remake of Mulan was not going to have all the things that made the animated version so likeable (e.g. no Mushu, none of those nostalgic catchy music aside from the boring overrated 'Reflections', and getting rid of the fun comedy aspect of the original film), I immediately felt a big letdown by the big Mouse House. Needless to say, I knew this movie was going to flop. A serious mature version of Mulan has been made many times by Chinese filmmakers (and ALL have been forgettable) so if Disney had done their research they would know this.A mature Mulan movie has never succeeded financially so Disney was indeed full of themselves for thinking that their mature version of Mulan would be any different. I feared that this film would become another Hong Kong martial arts film and sure enough, it did. The dumb wireworks, running up walls and defying gravity just made this film even more stupid to watch. They were not executed as well as wuxia films made in Hong Kong/China. Sure the visuals (sets and backdrops) are nice to look at but nothing that other Hollywood big budget films haven't provided before. Disney should have kept this live Mulan like the animated version.This film's biggest mistake was hiring the wrong director to helm this project. It's evident that Niki Caro is not a true fan of the animated Mulan for if she was, she would have never considered this awful script (especially the idea of a Mulan gifted with Chi from birth) and excluded the best scenes from the cartoon version (the scene where Mulan stayed awake at night to contemplate about her decision to take her father's place in the army and the build up to her putting on the armor and riding off into the night or how she was outted at the end involuntarily). Here Mulan willingly exposes her identity all the while risk getting executed with nothing at all to gain from doing so. There's also a Wonder Woman moment in this version where Mulan took off her armor and let down her hair - it's a wonderful scene to look at but seriously - Earth to Mulan! What were the writers thinking?! You need those armor to protect you, especially in a battle where you are already outnumbered! I'd blame the Director for allowing this ridiculous script to come to life on screen.Another major mistake was leaving out Shang. The romance between Mulan and General Li Shang was not controversial like Disney had stated due to the #MeToo movement. It is quite the contrary because Shang never harassed Mulan or made any inappropriate moves on her even after finding out that she's a girl. There was rumor that Shang might have been perceived as gay/bisexual for falling for Mulan. But in the animated version, Shang never even thought of Mulan in that way while she kept her identity hidden. It was only because he found out that she was a girl that he started to realize what a wonderful woman she is and therefore she became a potential romantic prospect for him. Like most single young men of the time, marriage is most likely important to Shang and to find a suitable girl is challenging, especially for military men who have very few if any options. So there was nothing homo or bi about Shang - and if that was the reason his character was excluded from this live action - then all the more proof that Disney chose the wrong people to make this film - or worse, that the creative team behind this project is a tad too closeminded.Despite what others have said, if Disney wants to remake their hit animated classic films, they need to stick to the same winning formula that made the original version worked. Ignore the critics and keep it simple! The box office revenues of the live action Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Cinderella and The Lion King are all the proofs you need to know that this is true. Stray from the winning formula like this awful Mulan and Dumbo did and the films will suffer.",Mulan

The Cons: Without Mushu, Mulan is rather drab. The villians are more interesting in the animated film than this live-action one.Overall: A big part of why the animated film is a classic is the chemistry between Mushu and Mulan. Mushu is the mini dragon that serves in a Godfather role to her. Not only is Mushu missing but there's no other character filling that role.

You have brief flashes of characters, but they are not long enough for you to get attached. It's almost like a handmade quilt. Various different patches sawn together.In relation to the 1998 Mulan, I just wonder what this is. Even Mulan herself wasnt the same. She had ""The Power of Qi"" and that's why she was ""great"" but the original movies showed us that we didnt need powers or magic to have strength. Mulan of 1998 did it all on her own, with no magic.My biggest disappointment was Mushu. Not only because he was funny but he played key roles in the OG movie. He brought the fake document, he was used to light the cannon, and he helped her maintain cover. But what we get here is a Phoenix with less than 5 minutes of screen time in the whole movie.The two movies are completly different. The only thing that is the same is the matchmaker (not the scene, that was different also, but the actual character)... Maybe.",Mulan

This was onto of the horrible CGI studder that was Mulan landing off a roof... and the whole a woman can no use chi ideology which I do not have any clue where that came from. Chi is lifeforce, everyone has it. The next few scenes get worse with an actress that speaks bad English when their are hundred of Asian women that could have played the part. They forget that even though we are hearing English, they are speaking Chinese. The worse is the lines that are very badly written.

Oh, was I wrong... not only this movie is the most terrible Disney movie I have ever watched, but it's also a really bad movie in general. The most awful parts to me were the pseudo-kung fu scenes, which reminded me of really bad chinese movies about martial arts (there are good ones too, but I specifically mean the bad ones), with completely unrealistic fights and banal dialogues that are meant to be epic but are just ridiculous.

The videography was terrible at times and the CGI wasn't the best which made the great fighting scenes just good. Kind of ruined it.

Donnie Yen, Jet Li and Gong Li also did very well and really carry the scene.This movie is also quite heavy on depicting Chinese culture which is great, but often done without any explaination which could be confusing, e.g. the use of Phoenix and the use of Chinese character Xiao has a certain meaning in Chinese, but probably will be lost in translation to many people without understanding Chinese culture.

The creature effects seemed fake, and even the action was awkward and didn't make much sense. The movie introduces a new important character but they have a dissapointingly predictable path.

This version is an original unto itself. The tone, plot points, acting, and substance having purpose and provide a deep, gorgeous movie. I watched it twice and it just got better for me. I feel this script is much more thoughtful and meaningful. One key example, is the small but deep difference in the way Mulan reveals she is a woman. In this version, she decides to fight as a woman instead of being discovered while unconscious. It shows more purpose and agency on her part. The characters around her react to her decision, and not to their own findings. This subtle change in storytelling is powerful to young and old audiences. I applaud this version of the movie.",Mulan

The story is told from another perspective and every element fits perfectly to the other without applying force.
So my advice to you, go and watch it and form your own opinion. Your opinion is more valuable than the so called ""critics"" and ""experts"" that never had directed art, written a screenplay, or acted; and they're so insensible that can't understand a film that tells so much about life.",Mulan

---------------------For me, it was ok, sceneries are lovely, the look is definitely beautiful and I can see they tried to follow the original poem more than the animated version. I don't have a problem that it isn't like the animated version, in fact I welcome the more serious tone, and tried to be a standalone movie. Losing Mushu isn't a problem for me, because historic Mulan has no Mushu anyway and I feel this was an attempt to be an epic. There are good things and bad things about this movie and I will try to be fair.To be honest, the beginning of the movie already felt wrong as you come into the introduction scene of Mulan's village, which is a bunch of round houses. People from outside Chinese culture wouldn't spot the problem, but as someone who knows China, a historic land that has over 200 dialects and over 50 minorities culture, we instantly knew this isn't a typical Han Chinese dwellings, in fact it is a typical Hakka building which isn't started to be built until 12th century, and the original poem about Mulan is based from an era between 4th - 6th century AD. We can safely assume the ""historic"" Mulan come from the Northern part of China definitely not a Hakka who originated in the central part of China.Now some might say it isn't a huge problem as this doesn't affect enjoying a film... yes, to the average white person it doesn't. But it disrespects the varieties of cultures and minorities cultures that makes up China as a whole. Imagine as a Chinese person if I made a film about the English Queen Elizabeth I, and put her palace in the middle of Italy...It's beautiful, right? Surely if it looks good, it should be ok? No of course not. It looks good, but it isn't an authentic representation, so it is going to take people out of it because it doesn't feel ""real"" anymore. I compare to the seriousness of The Last Samurai when they were bothered enough to build a Japanese village from scratch, its attention to details and accuracy was so excellent that the Japanese extra was so shocked with joy and it tears up their eyes! Surely Disney can afford this type of authenticity but chose not to?Before I get into the plots, there's this biggest disappointment I have was that it's such a big waste for Gong Li's and Donnie Yen's character.Donnie Yen's character is supposedly a well respected war time hero/general, who embodies the model hero figure from the Chinese culture as someone who is fair, experienced, wise and firm. But with little proof and work from Mulan after her setting off the avalanche to deplete the enemies, which, he didn't even know it was her handy work, he just went and ask her to lead the army into the Imperial City because a handful of her comrades begged him to listen to her was such a flimsy plot for me.I mean, as the experienced General, surely he knows the way into the Imperial City? What about his honour? They need a better plot than this gleefully general handing the rest of the army to rookie Mulan for no good reason. In truth, the moment of gaining the General's respect is important in the story and it should be crafted better, because it shouldn't feel like so easily to obtain! Honour and trust has to be earned!Also, Donnie Yen hasn't got much action scene in this film either, which totally wasted the talent he has, and failed an opportunity to showcase what a tough war it was. Subsequently, this also rendered the whole Chinese army a bunch of wussy. In that sense, the animated version Mulan did a better job here than the real live action. And for somehow Mulan is the only one who has this special ""chi"" amongst thousands others soldiers is pretty unrealistic, which also brings me to another shock - when is ""chi"" being treated like a special power?""Chi"" can be strong or weak, ""chi"" flows in everyone's body (a literal translate means ""air"", but not literally air that you breathe). You can strengthen your chi by rigorous training. Most importantly, having a strong chi doesn't equate prowess.The mastery of martial art is a skill which requires technique, experience, and chi only plays a part. With only having a strong chi doesn't make you a kung fu master. That's why Chi Kung (the art of chi), is used for strengthening your body and health and is not a typically combat kung fu style. However, many martial artists also practice Chi Kung to strengthen their body, (the flow of chi), to maximise their endurance in combat. (And some say it helps you to heal faster or rejecting toxic out of your body).What this live-action rendition failed to illustrate is the real moral of the story about Mulan, they made everything so easily gained for her to achieve. I wanted to feel like I'm really rooting for her and be at the edge of my seat!The legendary Mulan that we (Chinese) all know so well, to us, it's always been about her determination, endurance, her bravery to be more than what she is being expected, and do the right thing with a courageous attitude without betraying the loyalty is what made her such a respectable figure for young girls to look upon to. The key point is making all those difficult decision and go through with it with bravery. The way they have used ""chi"" in the film as a way to illustrate Mulan is somehow born special, has regrettably chipped away that important backbone moral of this story and taking the attention away the most admirable qualities about Mulan.For Gong Li's character, what an awful shallow character! It has little to no depth to it. You don't feel you care about her, or emotionally invested in her at all. It's pretty obvious her character's existence is simply an excuse to use special effect, since she's a shape-shifter witch (tho I really can't recall Chinese folklores have witches. Traditionally, more like in the form of mystic masters, let alone a shape-shifting witch). And yet, as a powerful shape shifter, she cannot take the form of Khan and lead his army, or has to die so pointlessly when she can just wave her hand to deflect an arrow away from Mulan? Or just impersonated the Emperor and rule the kingdom instead?I mean, honestly, if you have power, why do you need to be cowered down to someone who is ordinary? The film needed to explain why a little bit more. Even if it's because Khan has an army, and she doesn't, the power dynamic should be more of a collaboration, than being ""enslaved"" by Khan. Because obviously, Khan has no power over Gong Li's character at all.And Mulan? Overall her character is ok, but it could have been even better if they investigate more into her feelings. On that point, I can't help but feel the actress has been very wooden-face, almost the same face in every scene, even when she is fighting or sad. It's consistently the same ""looking far away"" look in the eyes, and face is so unmoved that you almost thought she feels nothing at all.Overall, it's a ""certified-whitewashed"" and watered down story about a much loved Chinese legend. Remember the poem we have about Mulan, is about over 1500 years ago. The war she went to lasted for 10 years, and it took her another 2 years to travel back home. The film doesn't even give any hint about the emotional turmoil Mulan must face and the toughness of the war. I understand it is a film for kids, but even with that in mind, there's so much room that they can improve if Disney bothered to hire some Chinese writers who understands the backbone moral of the story and its culture in the writing room. In this case, the animated version did better as they had one Chinese writer on board.And the ""Loyal, Brave and True"" slogan? oh boy, I understand this is effective for children, to represent what Mulan is, or her cultural significance. But the way they play around it is somewhat chessy. It reminds me of all the Chinese words people tattooed on themselves in the 90s, purely because people think they look cool, but made no effort to understand the depth of its culture, which is what I can sum up about the film.",Mulan

1594,jdarragh7,Modern adaption of a Disney classic,8,12 September 2020,This was a solid movie with enough action to keep you entertained throughout.

1595,tju_girl,Here is why it doesn't work...,2,8 September 2020,"I want to give credit, where credit is due. The scenery is quite beautiful some places and most of the time, the actors do a good job. The story is mediocre, at best, and doesn't quite land the Asian vibe, neither the western vibe. I just kind of floats in the middle.Here are some of my main frustration points:Chi. They introduce and talk about chi, as if it is some sort of magic. Everyone has chi, we are told, but we only see two people with ""strong chi"" or ""chi magic"". Mulan and a Witch. It is never explained what chi can do and why it gives someone the power to change forms or turn into thousands of birds or anything...The only explanation as to why Mulan is so naturally gifted, is because of ""chi"" - which she apparently has more of than average. From the start it is established that Mulan is ""over-powered"" and apparently is quite masterful of many things, without needing to train or earn her power. This sets us up with the feeling, that Mulan will overcome anything without having to put in much effort, which makes her very hard to connect with as a character.The side-characters are boring. They introduce Yao, Po and Ling, Cricket is also a person apparently. There are a few interactions, and honestly seeing those guys together is quite nice. Too bad we get very little time to get to know them. They also created a new character, Honghui, who acts like a ""love interest"" throughout the movie, until the end where Mulan decides ""No, I'm a 2020 women, I don't need a man"" and she leaves without him. What was the point of even adding him? Just DON'T have a love interest AT ALL if this is the message you want to send. She clearly liked him, so why leave?They introduce this Witch character, who can shapeshift and is a master warrior. Creating this character is rather uninspired. Not only that, she - and the change they bring with her, aka ""chi magic"" - seems to actually go against some of the teachings of the original 1998 movie. The women of this movie (the Witch and Mulan) are only as good/better than the men because they have this (unfair?) advantage of magic chi. The original movie taught us that resourcefulness and intellect is what gets Mulan her victory, but this movie teaches us that if you are born with extra power, then you can win. It's a strange message.Apparently a lot of people can catch arrows mid-air, just before they get hit. This becomes a thing throughout the movie and it's a bit stupid. It almost becomes a point of the movie, since the villain dies to an arrow which he did NOT catch. That arrow was kicked off by Mulan (yes, kicked... She kicks arrows and spears and.. Don't get me started).The Witch can take form of any person, often flies around as a falcon, and can shoot ninja-stars with lightning speed. Major plot hole: Why didn't the Rouran raider leader just ask her to fly to the Imperial City, fly up to the emperor, take him out and throw the country into chaos? Afterwards they could swoop in while the army and the cities were in disarray, and they could have taken over the country without suffering too many losses. Instead they use her to speak with the emperor (privately, that is) and lure him into an unfinished temple...Finally the villain actually captures the emperor (not before Mr Emperor slaps some bad guys to death with a curtain of course - no I'm not kidding, it's a curtain). The bad guy doesn't kill the emperor yet, because like any other villain he must do it in some elaborate way. So, he has some melted steel and some torches and wants to burn the emperor alive.Overall a lot of minor things that I didn't really like:
The scenes between Mulan and her father are slow and don't feel as emotionally strong as they do in the 1998 version.In the end Mulan loses her fathers sword and says ""I now know how much that sword meant to you"" but, like, how does she know that? They didn't tell us or show us why this sword was important. There was no ""this was my fathers sword, he earned it when blablabla."" or ""It has been in my family for generations"" or any of that stuff. Just a sword, dude.We don't see any other witches or hear why they are feared. I mean, the Witch shows is why they fear her, but she explains her own backstory that people distanced themselves from her because of her power. Why did people fear her, before she even started doing bad things? It's not explained. Suddenly it doesn't have anything to do with being a woman, but has all to do with this magical power which no-one even explains to us.It doesn't have any of the lighthearted Disney moments and it doesn't have a strong emotional impact.Overall: Uninspired, boring and full of clichés. Mediocre movie, with some laughable martial arts moments. Once in a while they cite the original songs, though, so that's nice... 2/10.",Mulan

Not only that, she - and the change they bring with her, aka ""chi magic"" - seems to actually go against some of the teachings of the original 1998 movie. The women of this movie (the Witch and Mulan) are only as good/better than the men because they have this (unfair?) advantage of magic chi. The original movie taught us that resourcefulness and intellect is what gets Mulan her victory, but this movie teaches us that if you are born with extra power, then you can win. It's a strange message.Apparently a lot of people can catch arrows mid-air, just before they get hit. This becomes a thing throughout the movie and it's a bit stupid. It almost becomes a point of the movie, since the villain dies to an arrow which he did NOT catch. That arrow was kicked off by Mulan (yes, kicked... She kicks arrows and spears and.. Don't get me started).The Witch can take form of any person, often flies around as a falcon, and can shoot ninja-stars with lightning speed. Major plot hole: Why didn't the Rouran raider leader just ask her to fly to the Imperial City, fly up to the emperor, take him out and throw the country into chaos? Afterwards they could swoop in while the army and the cities were in disarray, and they could have taken over the country without suffering too many losses. Instead they use her to speak with the emperor (privately, that is) and lure him into an unfinished temple...Finally the villain actually captures the emperor (not before Mr Emperor slaps some bad guys to death with a curtain of course - no I'm not kidding, it's a curtain). The bad guy doesn't kill the emperor yet, because like any other villain he must do it in some elaborate way. So, he has some melted steel and some torches and wants to burn the emperor alive.Overall a lot of minor things that I didn't really like:
The scenes between Mulan and her father are slow and don't feel as emotionally strong as they do in the 1998 version.In the end Mulan loses her fathers sword and says ""I now know how much that sword meant to you"" but, like, how does she know that? They didn't tell us or show us why this sword was important. There was no ""this was my fathers sword, he earned it when blablabla."" or ""It has been in my family for generations"" or any of that stuff. Just a sword, dude.We don't see any other witches or hear why they are feared. I mean, the Witch shows is why they fear her, but she explains her own backstory that people distanced themselves from her because of her power. Why did people fear her, before she even started doing bad things? It's not explained. Suddenly it doesn't have anything to do with being a woman, but has all to do with this magical power which no-one even explains to us.It doesn't have any of the lighthearted Disney moments and it doesn't have a strong emotional impact.Overall: Uninspired, boring and full of clichés. Mediocre movie, with some laughable martial arts moments. Once in a while they cite the original songs, though, so that's nice... 2/10.",Mulan

1598,josie12037,Remake Not A Repeat,10,5 September 2020,"Absolutely loved Mulan. A lot of the Disney remakes have just been repeats of the classics. I think it's been disappointing and dull seeing all of the classics forcefully reimagined just to make them ""updated"" or ""real."" This Mulan had the same message, but it was refreshing to not have to compare it to the original scene-by-scene and to have a slightly more serious tone. I also loved the main message; loyal, brave, and true.Beautiful cinematography and wardrobe, making it a colorful treat to watch. Also was great seeing an all-asian cast represented as well.All in all, if you want to gripe about this not being exactly the same as the original, then watch the original. But if you want something new and refreshing, this Mulan will provide.",Mulan

I cant really put my finger on it, but it was a weird mix of inorganic relationship dynamics and a flat storyline that didn't trigger my emotions as the original animation did. I really wanted to like it, but I ended up being bored throughout the movie and I even cringed at times because it tried to force a message that didn't really come naturally. What I remember about the 90s animation was the humor, which this movie tried to blend in, but the jokes never landed and left you feeling embarrassed.And it pains me to write this, because I know how much time and energy people put into it, you can see it in the visual scenery, the fighting sequences and costumes, but somehow it didn't seem authentic which I feel was supposed to be the message of the movie.",Mulan

1606,menehune808,"I rarely side with the critics, but...",9,25 September 2020,"...I couldn't believe the consistently low scores by the typical movie audience. Comments like ""wooden acting"" and ""no soul""?!? C'mon people! If you take into consideration the timeline and ethnic (male-centric) culture, the display of - or reserve from displaying - emotions was totally apropos. Don't tell me you were expecting Mulan to break character and lead China's first feminist movement back in the day (4th-6th century AD)?I remember when Disney first announced their plans to re-make Mulan into a live-action film. At the time, I thought their decision to ditch Eddie Murphy's character from the original was sacrilegious! But the live-action version made me a believer. The function of Murphy's character was to be a comedic sidekick to Mulan; this was unnecessary since the live-action version was targeting a wider/older audience.My last jab at the negative reviews addresses the artistic liberties taken to re-tell the original Mulan movie; converting an animated movie into a live-action film. I'll cite two relative examples: a) The Lion King and b) The Jungle Book, both live-actions directed by one of my favorites, Jon Favreau. The Lion King was a near replica of the original, where I barely made it to the 20-minute mark going in. The Jungle Book provided a different version -filled with all the same characters. Now, if I had never seen either of the animated originals then I probably would have enjoyed both movies equally. As a returning customer, I was less impressed by TLK's live-action cinematography than caring to go down memory lane; I already knew the movies' ending and felt I was watching a rerun.TJB was a fresh approach to a movie I saw as a child. It kept my attention throughout. Similar to driving home after work, would you take the normal route that you could do blindfolded or would you take a new route (to see if it's a shorter route, maybe it's more scenic, perhaps it's more driver-centric, etc.). For whatever reason, a new route/version engages to driver/movie audience.That's my two cents on this matter. Give this new version of Mulan a chance...it won't disappoint.",Mulan

1614,keriso,Mulan hit the right spot,8,8 September 2020,"As a person who grew up with Disney shows and also very familiar with the Chinese martial movies of old and new I think it is admirable that a Disney with a western lady director has been able to create this nice mix of folklore with a sound foundation for the Chinese culture.Some may cynically say it was targeted also for the Chinese market - so I would say yes, and it will be a smart commercial move to do so. But beyond that, on the story merit itself - it stand its ground and Yifei wonderful performance capture the essence of Mulan. Niki has a sensitivity which raise the quality of this movie higher.for a western director to understand the soul of the Chinese culture, I will give her high marks for this. To add colour and beauty into the set and the cinematography, kudos too in the line of the Zhang Yimou etc - set piece and so on. It was delicate but strong, beautiful and elegant.This is not the Mulan of the Disney carton which is a soulless work which panders to the western idea of how such stories should be. That is why it didn't resonate with the Asians watching that - it was a farce with songs. I would much prefer Frozen if I want to watch something in that mode which is true to the core of that story.The reason why a lot of reviewers don't get it especially those from the western culture is, they don't understand. What I say next will probably piss them off, but it is basically the lack of soul , the lack of depth in their own culture and history. That is why I said Niki to her credit, was able to capture the. essence of it as a non Chinese. The other reason is just misplaced notions that they are helping someone by protesting or writing down this movie. The movie should be examined on the basis and merit of its script and work alone and not be imbued with the US-China ""war"" going on. 90% of the review here has really nothing to to do with the movie per se.In the end, in future it won't matter as the younger generation moves about more and there are more sharing of such worlds and listening and people will be aware of different cultures and norms and learn to accept and even appreciate it. This movie opens a door for others to share in that folklore which must transmit the soul of the movie - which is universal - it is about family, devotion, loyalty and as Jet Li and Donnie has succinctly put in, the other element which was added by Niki...true - true to yourself - how true, both cultures are slowly merging and finding universal things in themselves and this is why this movie works for meYifei convey the new Chinese girl who did what she has to do to protect the family she love - she did not run away , she took the load. In the end, everything work out well and she brought honour to the family - a very Chinese thing - and this is why it has soul. There won't be a bone spur kind of cop out story here.",Mulan

Witches & a phoenix are allowed in fairy tales, and thankfully they decided to not include any talking animals as comic relief.

1618,elisenelson,"True to the Legend, Not the Original Movie",4,4 September 2020,"I am a massive Mulan fan, the original animated film has always been my favourite Disney movie. However, the animated version was different to the original legend, and that is what the new live action movie stays true to (or more so than the animated movie). It isn't so much a live action remake as a live action retelling, and I did enjoy it, but just not as much as the animation. I missed Mushu, the music and villains, who were very creepy and threatening in the original. This movie felt very much like a Disney+ production, not something I could imagine in the cinema and I found it hard to connect with the characters and the story, sometimes finding myself bored. Without the iconic music, both the instrumental score and the Disney songs, the emotional moments failed to pack as much of a punch. I would recommend the movie for a watch nonetheless (maybe when it's free) and there's no doubt you will enjoy it if you enjoy the original legend, but if you are expecting a 'true-to-the-previous-film' remake, you'll be disappointed.",Mulan
1619,mtpinkerton,I can't believe what people are writing.,10,26 September 2020,"This movie was an original in itself. It didn't HAVE to be just like the animation. Disney made it their own with some twists and differences but still managed to follow the main storyline. This movie wasn't meant to be a musical. The live action Cinderella wasn't either and people didn't hate on it. Sure they took out the love story with Shang and the trusty sidekick with Mushu but instead they made the story about Mulan finding love within herself and being true instead of basing the whole film around being in love with a fellow officer. Her fellow warrior men helped her defeat the bad guy and I think that was a good cover for Mushu.This movie in my opinion had a lot of good female empowerment and that it showed Mulan didn't need a male character to come in and sweep her off her feet. She did the damn thing herself and I really think people are missing this message. I recommend thinking about these point when watching instead of taking all these bad reviews and not giving it a chance.People wanted it to be exactly like the original, but come on, then it would be boring and unoriginal. It was filled with emotion, action and great new characters.",Mulan

The cartoon is one of my favorites so the expectations were high. 5/10 is for nostalgia and because I can only assume Disney made many choices in this movie that were commercially driven (gaining traction in the Asian market I suppose). So many times they did not use great dialoge from the cartoon when they could have. For example, when the father in the cartoon says: ""I know my place, it is time you learned yours"", in this version he says something like: ""I know what I have to do.."".

It's lovely!

She has been told all her life that she wasn't good enough or that she fit in. On top of that Chinese culture promotes a more contained way of showing emotions.The witch character was so cool. She was beautiful and strong but used her powers only how she wanted to use them, she was in control of everything during the movie.Yes the fighting scenes are a little over the top, but this is to still get a but of fantasy-action vibe. Something appreciated in typical Asian cartoons.Mushu if added to this movie would have never been as good as the cartoon. It was a great character, for a cartoon.Point is this movie is a real version, a different adaption of the story. It's even said so in the beginning of the film. It's not a replica of the cartoon, if it were, then yes it deserves the rating it has now. It's honestly a great movie and deserves at least a 7,5.",Mulan

She hits a low in the movie and comes back reborn stronger showing her true self. It's showing girls that they can be strong as woman and not to hide it because of gender. I liked how Ming-Na Wen introduced Mulan since she was the voice in the cartoon and while during the introduction playing an instrumental song from the cartoon.

Leave this aside and you might enjoy the supple way of fighting in Mulan.I would say that overall, it is a quite enjoyable movie with lots of colours, not so great music and an interesting focus on the powers of women. To be honest, it somehow feels less like a kids movie. The target group maybe is us, those who knew the animated Mulan version already.

I got quite emotional in the final quarter of the movie.It was a great cast well chosen for each character and well acted.I can't understand why there is such a low average score for the film.

1636,gnvt,"This isn't the original ""Mulan"", but difference isn't a bad thing.",8,25 October 2020,"I don't understand all the negativity toward this movie. In fact, it inspired me to write this movie. I enjoyed this new interpretation of ""Mulan"" as a modern action epic.In the past, with its live-action interpretations of its animated films, Disney has received criticism for pretty much making substandard copies of the originals. Here, the filmmakers dared to present a spin on the original movie, but not an exact copy of it. In doing so, the movie has artistic integrity, which should be applauded. It has a reason for being other than piggybacking on the original. If you want to see the original movie again, watch it, but don't criticize this one simply for daring to be different.There is much to enjoy here. The cinematography is stunning, with the camera capturing gorgeous landscapes and widespread battles from up above. This is epic filmmaking that was clearly meant to be seen on a big screen. It's a shame that, within most areas, it won't be because of the Covid-19 pandemic.The casting is perfect, and I liked the changes that were made to the story, particularly the fantastical ones. For example: the addition of a witch. The original Mulan telling is a legend passed down from generation to generation, and stories are often embellished. It's not bound by a need for realism. Plus, Gong Li is always entertaining to watch because she has a magnetic presence.Some minor quibbles are as follows. Mulan's disguise as a male soldier isn't very credible and, therefore, requires a leap of faith. (However, perhaps this is a result of modern, knowing eyes viewing it? After all, women have fought as men within battles in the past and pulled off the disguise.) Also, there's very little comic relief in the movie, but perhaps there shouldn't be within a truly respectful version of this tale.The good here far outweighs anything that's bad. But again, if you watch this expecting to see a live-action copy of the original, you're going to be disappointed. However, if you enter into it with an open-mind, you might just enjoy the sheer spectacle of all of it.",Mulan

If anyone else made this movie it could be considered pretty decent but it was very boring as a Disney movie where you expect a level of whimsy and emotion. They basically spent all that money to make a typical Chinese martial arts war movie. For that you can pic any authentic Chinese movie off of Netflix for free and be equally entertained as their costumes, sets and action are just as good.They removed the songs ostensibly to make it more realistic but I think they did it because they're now considered non-politically correct. Even the gender reveal was politically corrected to give Mulan agency or something. I guess that's not bad in and of itself but it made the film boring and unsuspenceful.Also Mulan had super powers from the beginning and was guided by a phoenix instead of talking dragon. That direction in and of itself wasn't bad but the way it was implemented was lack luster. Also if you think about it, it gives the idea that women aren't equal fighters unless they have super powers rather than through hard work?The sum of my review though is basically that it's very frustrating because they did a lot in the film but not of lot of the things the audience actually wanted.

1641,diligoveritas,This should be called X-Men: the Red Phoenix instead of Mulan,1,7 September 2020,"Oh boy, where do I start?
Plot is a mess. Just to point out a few glaring points: Why would Gong Li work with Bori Khan, who clearly disrespect her and treats her poorly, if her Qi allows her to possess others and force them to do things that benefits her anyway. Why would the commander of an army agree to Mulan's request anyway and even lead that team back to the capital city? Abandoning your post is probably punishable by death and they had no reason to trust her.
Costume and architecture is a horrible, I can't believe the lead costume designer can say they're honest with their work in a straight face on camera and this is the work of studying with material from Europe and 3 months in China. Traditional costuming enthusiasts does better than this. I don't mind if they're not accurate. Nobody does historically accurate costumes anyway but at least don't mix all the different styles together. Even in an AU European court movie, you won't really want to see one people dressed in Tudor clothing and the next in Regency and the other in Victorian.
And the special effects... Are you sure that's a phoenix and not a kite?",Mulan

The trailer gave me the idea that it would be a more mature version of the original, considering that there would be no songs and sadly no Mushu.. However this movie wasn't in my opinion much more mature than the original. It is clearly still very much a children's movie. Which is fine however it doesn't in my opinion fit in the way this movie is portrayed now. I missed the fun parts and I didn't connect with the characters at all. Also it was obviously meant to be on the big screen. So watching it at home was less of an experience. Not worth my money, but I would have watched it anyway.

1647,jwick4224-758-437636,Excellent show of selfless love for others,10,8 October 2020,"This movie has symbolism that selfish people will not understand. It shows the heart of a warrior that risks everything for the sake of her father, her family and her country. Not only that, it's risk against all odds and reason for the time period. Yes, it has some magical elements that aren't reality, but it's a Disney movie for cryin out loud.
It's got beautiful elements of the Joan of Arc story by how she feels a calling and uses her gifts appropriately, even though it's totally forbidden for time period. And even David and Goliath from the Bible, where a undersized, seemingly weaker person fearlessly stares evil in the face and stays the course until the evil is gone.
Also, the use of the Phoenix bird is a perfect add-in that provides hope and shows a ""Spirit lead"" (for the Christians reading this) in some of the darkest and most powerful moments.
It's not exactly the same as the cartoon, but I thought it made it more appropriate for a teenager or adult to watch and the kids can still watch the cartoon version.
I don't rate a ten for many movies, but this one was convicting and encouraging to the warrior spirit inside that's wants to see evil defeated at every turn.",Mulan

1650,amason5995,I'm torn I guess.,8,9 January 2021,"I'm giving 8 stars because I legitimately enjoyed watching this. Though the cultural inaccuracies did take away from the immersion and I don't even know them all as I'm not Chinese. Then again I don't think it really made any mistakes that the original didn't make so I'm not understanding the real problem there.Spoilers
One of the most common complaints I'm seeing is that this movie and the acting were heartless. People seem to be mistaking subtly and inner battles with heartlessness. For instance, Mulan didn't show her full talent when she first arrived because A. She didn't want to garner any unnecessary attention and B. She realized after a while that she's subconsciously holding back because that's what she's been doing for years at home.This movie does a wonderful job of illustrating Mulan as fiercely independent in a time where women were meant to be wholly dependent. The scenery is beautiful. Li Gong gives a deeply passionate take on a woman similar to Mulan but who let hatred overtake her instead of truth and honor. I don't know why people are so turned off by the twist on Kahn's eagle. Or why they think the Phoenix was pointless. The Phoenix inspired Mulan to keep going, it just did that without words or even real interaction. I think this makes it a more impressive detail than a funny sidekick that exists in almost every cartoon Disney movie.Also, about the Phoenix, I liked that it didn't take anything away from Mulan's independence. There's a minor air of classical misogyny that Mulan needed to rely on a male dragon when that dragon proved to be the more incompetent player of the two. The Phoenix allowed Mulan to be the true hero of this story. There was no reliance on men, no real love story, and honestly overall I just found it much more empowering than the cartoon.That being said I would agree that it went over the top with its superhero moments. It would have been more impressive if they fought with exceptional skill than exceptional magic. As for her taking off her armor and letting her hair down to represent her new found devotion to truth, I can see two sides. The more obvious being that it's very stupid to take armor OFF during battle, and illogical to add a clear distraction such as hair flying all over, compromising visual clarity. The other side is that she felt constricted wearing so much armor and wanted to embrace femininity while also being badass. The second point is a bit of a stretch though and really I agree with others, that that was out of place.TL;DR really captivating movie if you're not going into it with expectations of the cartoon.",Mulan

1654,ginnygirl1997-878-921839,Some major mistakes,2,15 December 2020,"I have a list of complaints about this movieThe movie wanted to be taken seriously as an adult war movie and it is trying way too hard without becoming mature in the important meaningful ways and I'll explain further below.2. Mulan shows little to no emotion on her face or in her voice and it makes her seem I relatable and robotic.
3. The movie is trying so hard to not be a musical like the animated version that it fails to use any music in any meaningful way. There are awkward montages that could benefit from a stronger melodic motif. For example, the reflection theme doesn't appear until Mulan sheds her disguise for the first time, but it doesn't carry any emotional weight at that point because we don't see it representing her feeling of struggle and loss of identity earlier in the movie, so it has no impact other than nostalgia.
4. The movie removes the familiar magic from the original (like Mushu and the ancestors) but adds in a new ch'i magic that is not explained and doesn't make sense or seem well thought out so it just appears to make certain characters really OP for no real reason.
5. The movie lacks any scenes that show internal conflict, character self-development, and values conflicts. They emphasize over and over how Mulan is all about duty and family but they don't really show her relationship to these values. Do they come in conflict with each other? Does she get frustrated with others when they don't have a strong sense of duty like her? Does she struggle with her devotion to her family or her hatred of her duty despite how much she values it?
6. Any jokes made fall flat and seem stupid and cheesy, no good jokes are made to lighten the mood so it seems monotonous filled with a few moments that make it seem completely stupid.
7. The costume designers focused so hard on making the costumes historically accurate that they lose a lot of relatability and character. For example, in their armor it is hard to tell the men apart. In the cartoon this can be done with stylistic changes between characters, overemphasis on body shapes, and closeups of the face. The movie sacrifices this sense of character development to stay accurate in its historical context and the emotions suffer because of it.
8. The live action film changes things that were great in the animation and makes them worse and keeps scenes that were stupid in the animation where they should be replaced. For example, the scene where Mulan creates an avalanche would look beautiful in live action as well as the scene on the roof of the palace. Additionally, these show off how her heart and head make up what she lacks in size and strength to her enemies and make them pivotal in the original. Instead the closest we get is when she cuts the rope in the weird construction site (that doesn't seem to fit in ancient China but ok). Then they keep scenes like the one where Mulan takes a bath in a pond or the big vs matchmaker situation that just doesn't fit well.Overall this movie is a total wash. I finished it, though only with the crutch of games on my phone, and even with that I have a full list of complaints. Don't waste your time and certainly don't waste your money.",Mulan
1655,christabellesng,Unfulfilled potential,4,28 October 2020,"Though not an entirely un-watchable film, Mulan unfortunately did not live up to the hype generated by extensive publicity and buzz. Fantastic cinematography and stunt work though, but sadly the best bits were when there was no verbal exchanges going on. There was definitely potential to be great. Even though the cast did the best that they could with what they were given, it was not enough to make up for lacklustre screenplay and writing. Gong Li, Jason Scott Lee, Donnie Yen to name a few, were great in the film. Some scenes and decisions made by characters made absolutely no sense at all. Disappointed to see that the film still contained some inconsistencies with both the time period and portrayal of the characters and settings (I suppose we have to overlook these as it is a Disney film after all). Personally hoped that they would have incorporated the Chinese culture and in a larger way (such as having some conversations in Mandarin, it is Mulan after all), as well as more subtle yet meaningful messages of female empowerment.
There were some obvious pacing issues with the film, but overall, lacked the Essence and heart of the original.",Mulan

It's well acted, the characters are clear & defined and while it may be a little simplistic & preachy this is a Disney film after all.
Like other recent films I can't help but wonder how many of the nameless critics are men who simply struggle to accept strong female characters. If you genuinely didn't like the film, or have issues with the heritage of the film and it's cultural misappropriation then that's fine, but I bet there's nowhere near as much grief on the Kung Fu Panda reviews.

The movie manages to achieve action and excitement without grotesque violence, instead displaying the action through clever editing and camera work.As girl having learnt martial arts from a very young age, and packed with skill, there seems to be many reviewers whom have limited understanding of the cultural references with Chinese ancestors and totems.I did think the soundtrack could have done with less western influences in some of the Instruments used in musical score, I felt the music was good, but in parts more eastern instruments could have been used.",Mulan

Cinematography, set design, photography, choreography, costume design, art department, wardrobe; all of it, A-mazing! If you want a 100% copy of the original- this ain't it. But what it IS, is a beautifully filmed, well-acted movie, that tells the story of Mulan. It is a feast for the eyes! Empowering messages aside (there are plenty), this movie shows that what a girl probably wants more than anything, is a proud father and a hug from her dad.

The cinematography is beautiful, and there are some really nice panoramic shots. I originally planned to give this movie 1 star, but figured it should be at least 2 due to the production quality.Touches on the topic of female empowerment.That's it.The Bad:
The dialogue was extremely stilted and awkward to the point where I would notice it every few lines. I feel like the script also negatively affected the acting as well.There was a distinct lack of focus on Mulan's relationship with the other soldiers, and overall the movie lacked the same sort of warmth that was shown in the Disney animation. I didn't care about the characters at all.They completely skipped over the process of Mulan working hard to overcome the difficult training in the army. That should've been crucial to developing her character like it was in the animation, but instead the audience just gets shown a shot of her magically improving one day.No music from the original Disney animation, which is made even more disappointing by the lack of unique musical score. At times the instrumentals sounded more Indian and Middle Eastern than Chinese.Fight scenes were surprisingly boring and overdone, the choreography felt like something I've seen a million timesOverall the movie just felt bland and emotionless, and I didn't really care about any of the characters in the end.",Mulan

1671,elpi25,The original was better,5,9 September 2020,"I had to revive my account just so I can give a review of this movie lol. This is one, or if not my most favorite Disney movie, and I really had high hopes for the action film. Sadly, it didn't live up to my expectations.Here are some points that I like from the film:
I love that they give more importance to the ""True"" virtue by relating it to Mulan's storyline. The original didn't emphasize this muchThe setting, although still not accurate, looks better than the originalFor the cons:
The acting was monotonous and not that good. I get that Mulan's maybe an introvert, but the actress' eyes and gestures should show what she feels even if there are no lines. Like the scene where she flew from above with her sword. Where are the emotions in your eyes???The characters. I don't feel connected to the characters. I didn't know them, and the fact that there's no music to introduce them made me feel that they're just background characters and nothing more. Also, the sister is unnecessary. She was just used as a character who would ruin Mulan's encounter with the matchmaker lolThe weaving of the story. a) The film did not highlight how the other soldiers got better in fighting. Not one died in the fight in the end. How??? b) Also, the story arc with the witch is kinda meh. It was just put there as an ornament, and not an important part of the movie. c) Her decision to go to war instead of his father was not highlighted at all. The scene just cut to her riding the horse with her armor on.The love story arc. It's a good thing that the movie did not dwell much in the love story arc of Mulan, but her connection with the new guy kinda seemed forced. It didn't feel organic to me. I just wish that they alloted more time for the two to develop feelings for each other.Overall, the film is still enjoyable. But, if I were to choose which version do I like better, I'd still choose the animated one.",Mulan

1674,owenemo,Enjoy this as it's own movie and stop comparing,8,6 September 2020,"First off - realise that this Mulan adaptation is not based off the Disney cartoon so much as off the ORIGINAL Chinese folklore.
Secondly, separate your enjoyment of the movie to your sentiments on the lead actress' political views.Once you view this movie in that context - it is a beautifully crafted movie that actually quite faithfully carries the themes from the Disney animated, albeit without talking dragons and dancing on the way to battles. Beautiful locations (New Zealand part of that hehe), amazing sets and costume designs that feel authentically Chinese yet also Disney-esque, and choreography that reflects the dramatised martial arts style of Chinese Kung Fu movies (ala Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon). Director Niki Caro did a great job trying to bring in more Chinese elements into the movie than the cartoon did to build more authenticity (eg. incorporating concepts like 'chi') into the setting of that world.
View this as it's own movie, not compared to the animated film before it, and you will find a beautifully crafted movie which carries a timeless message.Enjoy!",Mulan

I have only written one review so far but I saw the rating of this film and thought it definitely deserves more credit. It's hard to please everyone with a live action movie. Did they change a lot from the 1997 film? Yes! Is that a bad thing? No! The changes that the live action made were great because they made the story feel more real. Having a humorous talking dragon and the huns ""pop out of the snow like daisies"" would have probably seemed very cheesy in the live action. In my opinion the live action of Aladdin suffered from being very accurate to the cartoon, lots of parts came off as very cheesy, especially the cringey dance scene. People tend to complain if the live actions don't do anything different or they'll complain if it's the exact same. The changes didn't hurt the movie. The cinematography was still great, acting was superb, the fight scenes were great and Mulan is still really bad a**. Please still give this movie a chance and form your own opinion about it.

However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I enjoyed this movie. No, it's not Eddie Murphy-funny, and it doesn't have Donny Osmond singing about defeating Huns, but the reason why this move works is that the film doesn't try to recreate the exact same story, and only changing the medium.To be honest, I was really looking forward to the live action remake of The Lion King, but I also found it a little pointless to have an, almost entirely, shot for shot remake.I'm not going to pretend this is the best movie I've ever seen, but it's certainly worth more than the paltry 1-4 star reviews that I've seen on here.It's the same story but with some fresh elements that make it interesting to watch.

1681,eonimisi,"Excellent tribute to the animated version, and Excellent at being its own thing",8,5 September 2020,"This is the best of the Disney live action remakes: it honors the beloved nostalgia amd excels at being its own thing, unlike The Lion King (2019) for example.I totally understand that most folks that despise this movie do that either because there's no Mushu, it's not a musical like the previous one, or because of the lead actress' political comment that one time. So while I decided to view this with caution, I tried to be open-minded.
And, boy, did it pay off.
On its own merit, it's got some of the most amazing action sequences and stunning visuals. There was humor in the places I was not expecting. Right from the first scene, I loved Mulan and her family.
It honors its Chinese cultural roots, emphasising her love and respect for her family, despite her defiance because of that love.As this is a spoilery review, I'll delve into the bits that worried people.
NO MUSHU: Mushu wouldn't have fit in this movie, and it really didn't need him. His characterization was, reportedly, unlike the culture would have preferred. Instead we've got the Phoenix who, while not comedic, adds colour.NO SONGS: We don't watch Braveheart or Schindler's List for the songs, do we? Still, songs like ""Make a Man out of You"", ""Reflection"", ""A Girl worth fighting for"" and the matchmaker song are referenced in musical cues and some of the dialogue. The animated and live action media are very different, and they harnessed on its strengths here.-CRICKET: We got Cricket, alright, and his innocence and humor fits into the story quite well. I loved his reinvention as a supposedly 'lucky' recruit who grows in the movie.
It's not the animated movie: Once yoi can get over that part, you'll be glad it's not.To be honest there are SO many moments that were translated into live action here in ways that brought something new, with humor and heart grounded within this movie and not just rooted in the animated version we know (cough, Lion King, cough).Other winning points are the battle scenes, a surprise redemptive arc for a villain, and the elegant older cast, especially that one dignified cameo of Ming Na, our first Mulan, as she presents Liu's Mulan to the Emperor. It said so much about Asian representation and the weight of this movie as a moment for them.Now it would be unfair to not mention my demerits.
First, I felt some emotional beats at the beginning were a bit rushed. But the deeper I got into the movie I got to appreciate the subtly of Liu's emoting and to know the characters better. Once the movie got into its element, it just kept getting better.
Second ... oh wait, I can't think of a second. It was that good!Finally, I love the fact that we have both versions of the story to enjoy. Once you get past the fact that this is not the other version, and that it's made with the Chinese culture and audience in mind, you'll appreciate the movie for what it is: An Excellent tribute to the animated movie and a Soaring live action Chinese movie.
Like we accepted Parasite, perhaps we can also be accepting of other forms of cinema and let them be what they were made to be.",Mulan

They had the potential to make such an amazing epic yet this fell flat on it's face. The special effects and choreography lacked realism and felt very fake. The character development was also nonexistent. Yet another pointless remake from Disney. Don't waste your time watching it.",Mulan

If you expect the first version you saw, you will always be disappointed.This movie was honestly bada**. As a HUGE fan of Mulan as a child, this one really grew up with me. Showcased a strong willed, amazing women kicking butt and being proud of it. Total FEMALE EMPOWERMENT.",Mulan

But this is not remake of animation. Just like The Lion King or Maleficent. You must evaluate this movie from a new perspective.,Mulan
1689,tjmiton,"Did not have high expectations, yet was still disappointed.",3,9 September 2020,"The original Mulan is one of Disney's very best, mostly due to it's great humour and fun, so when I heard there was no Mushu character here I was a little sad, expecting them to play it straight rather than have magic and comedic elements but willing to give a serious take on the story a go. However, they don't actually remove the supernatural from this, in fact they add way more completely trash tier supernatural elements into it, done with awful characters and even worse CGI quick cut action. The acting here is bad, the characters are bad, the story and writing is bad and has nothing new, the CGI is awful and makes the whole movie look like a complete mess any time there's any action going on. Add to that the absurd way this movie was rolled out on Disney+ for a pile of money that no one should have to pay for any film and this is a VERY easy one to highly recommend skipping.",Mulan
1690,reviewgrandmaster,Pretty Decent,8,6 September 2020,"Seriously, it was announced that this take on Mulan will be vastly different from the animated movie, that it will be based on the original story, yet people still expected that they will see Mushu and the musical sequences. The REASON for most of the negative reviews here.Now onto the things that I liked about this movie. Mulan's relationship with his father has improved. She doesn't need much help from the ancestors (thus the absence of Mushu and his replacement by a phoenix). One of the villains has actually a great fair reason behind her actions. It is more faithful to the source material and with it being a live action movie, it is more epic and is more masterful on the fight sequences.The actors in this movie did a great job, however the best acting goes to Gong Li's Xianniang. The villain that I was talking about. She and Mulan share similarities. They're both women and they use their chi, and it is forbidden in their China that a woman wields chi. The only difference between the two is that Mulan is accepted by her father, her comrades, and her commander. Xianniang was banished from her village, and Bori Khan, the other villain who looks like Shan Yu from the animated film, found her, and saw her as an opportunity to lead his army to success. Mulan asked Xianniang for help in finding the emperor. She told her that it is not too late to do goodness, and Xianniang was able to redeem herself, she was able to take the noble path for a while, before sacrificing herself to save Mulan.Now the bad stuff, this movie doesn't try to be much more creative. Although it is closer to the source material, I think that they could've improve more. Mulan's training wasn't improved. It's still the same. There's also the lack of compelling characters, with the exception of Mulan and Xianniang. It isn't as memorable as the original one.Overall, the movie is pretty decent. I enjoyed watching it. And about to Liu's message about the HK protests, watching this movie doesn't make you against human rights. It doesn't make you a supporter of the CCP. Watch this with your political views set aside.",Mulan
1691,timothyrswann,Don't trust the bad reviews,7,12 September 2020,"This is unlike the original animated one from the 90s, but that doesn't make it a bad movie. It's a decent film for what it is, a modern take on a story that is centuries old. It tells the tale of a female warrior in ancient China who concealed her gender.If you expect a version similar to the original motion picture from the 90s, you will be very disappointed",Mulan

1693,lilnanda,The Ballad of Mulan. Educate yourself.,10,9 September 2020,"Mulan herself is a legendary heroine based on The Ballad of Mulan that was written by a Chinese poet around 380 AD. There have been many adaptions of this ballad. Just like there have been many adaptions of stories written by Hans Christian Andersen and the Grimm Brothers, most have been animated by Disney.I loved how the focus of the movie was on Mulan. It's her origin story. Liu Yifei, Mulan, did majority of her own stunts! I liked how it showed the backstory of her martial art talents and how it conflicted her. Those of Asian background can understand and strongly relate to the self conflict she experienced of what is right and being true to oneself. The song Reflection takes on a deeper meaning after knowing Mulan struggles. I loved how it emphasized chinese culture; chi, phoenix, wardrobe, etc. Stop comparing live action disney movies to the animation disney movies. Just watch it as it is.",Mulan
1694,jultep,Cinematic Fable,9,19 December 2020,This is not a live action version of the animated movie beauty and the beast or Aladdin was.

1697,lucaweyzig,"China is beautiful, but the movie is somewhat... Off..",6,7 September 2020,"Ill start with positives. I really like the art direction of this movie. They really did a good job presenting China. The acting is solid but nothing exceptional. But that is pretty much it.Apart from bad CGI at some moments, pretty much everything that is bad, can be linked to the script or director.The script is no way terrible, but its nog good ether. This movie is a lot longer than its animation counter part. But it feels like they focussed on the wrong things.My real issue is with the director. There are some weird moments in the movie that could have been a lot better if she just paid a little more attention. For example. Its really weird if you have a beautiful set decoration presenting China, but the actors dont act in a traditional Chinees manner.Did i enjoy the movie? Yes i did. Even my girlfriend, Who's favorite Disney movie is Mulan, enjoyed the movie. But, no. I dont think this is a good movie and therefore, Disney has jet to make a good live action movie of its animation movies.",Mulan

That's the point.There were lots of complaints that the live-action Lion King was basically a shot for shot remake. And there are complaints that this is not. You can't please everyone.It it perfect, no.

Fighting for an emperor with absolute power while taking one man from every family? No problem, here you go. Gone ahead and waste them so you can stay on your throne. Why do the Mongols invade? Who knows. It doesn't matter. Just fight for your ruler.Story goes like this: Foreigners (bad) are invading China and a little girl (good) fights for her great nation. That's it.Character devolpment is non existent. Except for the witch, who changes her mind just because Mulan asks her nicely.Jet Li acts like a tree stump, Donie is OK but his character stays the same for the entire movie.This movie is a boring generic attempt to cash in big in Winnie Country. It reminds me of the south park episode where the boys were censored until nothing was left.

Then of course pandemic struck, theaters closed, releases got cancelled. Well, I finally got to see it and I must say, it fulfilled all my high expectations.This was much better than the cartoon version. I liked the cartoon version a lot. It was really cute and funny. This had a more serious tone, but was ultimately a far better movie. The scenery was, in a word, stunning. The fight scenes were awesome. I loved everything about the witch, from her character arc to her fighting skills to the actress they chose. Also, I was glad they left out the musical numbers-having characters randomly burst into song is hard to get right without seeming a little corny.This was gorgeous in 4K but I still wish I could have seen it on the big screen.",Mulan

While some negative reviews make valid points, I feel like too many of them are focused on the wrong things-that this is not a remake of the original Disney Mulan, and they are disappointed in that. There is nothing wrong in feeling that way, but it had been said from the beginning that this would be a different version of the story and not like the animated movie. However, it seems like people are still judging this version based on the old one.
If you can watch this movie with an open mind and not compare it to the old one I believe you will enjoy it, or at least enjoy it more (not everyone will, even when they aren't comparing the two, because as I said before- it is not perfect and not without flaws).

1729,NDSand,This film isn't Mulan,3,1 August 2021,"My problem with this movie is it was made to sound like a live action remake of the 1998 musical film, as they did with Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King, etc. This film completely stripped everything that made the 1998 film Mulan so enjoyable, There's no Mushu, The ""Lucky Cricket"" was turned into a human, that had almost no impact on the plot, the film used quiet instrumentals for the songs we heard in the original film, and even stole one of those songs from Pocahontas. Changing the enemy from the historical Huns who were attacking the Imperial army to a witch and ""northerners"" just pushes the film to feel less like Mulan. The CGI could definitely be better, but nothing is worse than the zoom blur that is cut into scenes and has 0 movement to it where Mulan uses her Chi is probably the worst part of this film.It's not all bad, I personally have a love for films that adapt the Chinese culture and Martial Arts. They do it pretty well actually. The action scenes in this film can make up for its poor storytelling execution but not enough to be worth 5 stars.",Mulan
1730,collinatthebeach,"For Chinese Audience, boring (spoils)",1,5 September 2020,"Mulan rides on the coattails of my favorite Disney cartoon and strips it of everything compelling and entertaining. Let's take emotional impactful scenes such as the introduction of the Huns, The role-call of the enlistment of the families, Mulan fighting about her place in family and leaving home that give the original movie it's beautiful identity. This movie makes those emotion-filled scenes, and well reduces it monotone, un-dramatic scenes. The dialogue is so bad, oh my God... The threat of the Huns or what ever they're called in this is nothing compared to that of the first one. The lack of showing the Huns in the cartoon and just their destruction made them seem that much more menacing. This movie strips that all away. All of it. Mulan's trials to overcome her constraints as a sheltered woman to become the strongest amongst the troops? None of that. She's OP from the start with her chi. And the whole time the only problem in the movie is not her hiding her disguise but her guilt of hiding it. The whole reason was to save her family and not risk her own family's honor. This time, there's no threat of such, there's no threat at all, and the sequence of events to get to that wasn't compelling, she had a fight, she wasn't as strong since she was 'lying to herself'. Like what? You aren't lying to yourself, you're literally saving your dad, and giving your family honor and keeping it a secret to others, it's not a moral dilemma, BUT I SUPPOSE TO THE CHINESE STATE, DO NOT LIE TO THE STATE NO MATTER WHAT ITS ABOUT I GUESS. That is glossed over and just like, 'oh I want to show how strong Mulan is'. And when you take out Mushu, No Eddie Murphy? No entertaining side character? Wow, it's dull. You may ask while watching this, oh it's bad but not bad enough to walk out of. It is that bad. It literally is so bad, I felt like walking out, but I couldn't cuz someone bought it and I didn't wanna be rude. But it was funny we all wanted to leave but felt it would be rude, even the person that bought it. I could write a book on how this movie sucks. I'm thinking of the meme template of The Godfather saying 'look how they killed my boy'. Look, I hate Disney's live action adaptations, only one I could tolerate was Beauty and the Beast. But when you strip a movie of funny scenes you have to replace it with something right? NOPE! Just make the most monotone, dialogue. OH MULAN JUST LEFT HOME, if we get her the army will kill her, the dialogue was so monotone and it was the writers were a bunch of 3rd graders. I am critical of movies, especially when I hold very special place in my heart for its original. I can say, this is perhaps the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Shame on Disney. Making people pay 30 bucks for this garbage. Hamilton was FREE????!!?!!? BUT THIS WAS 30 BUCKS!??!!?

This movie didn't go so far fetched like the Sleeping Beauty, it still follows the same story but with updated themes that's more familiar to people today.This movie was a beautiful retelling of the story. While it may not follow some of the original scenes and characters, it has its own magic of its own and has earned its rightful place as a Disney classic.As a father of a daughter Milan's representation is everything that is right about this movie.

The problem I keep seeing is that if your a fan of Disney animated movies, you will end up hating the none animated ones.

Some scenes look really amazing but others feel like they are produced by an indie company with really bad effects. I expected a lot of changes in the movie and there were a lot of changes. Mostly i miss the funny side of the movie and they could have put some comical scenes inside despite the fact that Mushu doesn't exist here. It's sad to see such a cartoon become into this thing.

That does an injustice to the movie's actual review. And it's not about watching it on a TV screen instead of the theater.Second, please understand that these remakes aren't replacing the originals. There's no way they can. The originals are masterpieces. I wouldn't want anyone to make live action copies of them.So, this movie is not the best. It felt rushed at times. Then there's these epic moments that were very emotional. They did add some political correctness to it. But it didn't feel overdone. I have to admit I was a bit disappointed not having any musicals. I was at least hoping for Reflection. But despite the lack of music, my family and I enjoyed it. We'd watch it again.Oh, the fight scenes were great!",Mulan

They make mulan extremely overpowered without training, other than training to not hide her power (captain marvel?). Femenist hero films want to make the protagonist so perfect and powerful they ruin a good story (like Rey on star wars and captain marvel). It would be a great and inspiring story if they didn't try so hard to avoid giving a girl flaws, the overpowered hero ruins it. The other characters had no depth. The entire story is 'mulan learns to be herself', everything else are minor details and forgettable. But the colorful cities looked cool. I recommend the cartoon version. That one is great.",Mulan

Well acted, fun, compassionate and exciting there is a lot to like here.Casting is very good. The lead is quite believable and you feel for her throughout. Was great to see Gong Lee in her role and others.It is nice to see women empowered and I think this film does a wonderful job re-interpreting the story.To the hard core traditionalists who are up in arms over this, raise money and make your own version if you are so annoyed with this one. Meanwhile the rest of us will enjoy this story knowing it isn't 100% true to the ancient tale, but is a nice modern take on it that was a lot of fun to enjoy.Watch it.

South park hit the nail on the head with disneys spiral downwards. This movie had no character development and alot of changes from the original animated.

The music on this one was trash compared to the original, none of the original songs were included!!!!! Only some hinted... I didn't recognise yao, Ling and Chien Po, I'm still confused; they had such big personalities in the original and were the perfect comedy reliefs, here on this one they are like extras, no personality and minimal sense of humour. Li shang!! It was such a cool character in the first one, here he's split into two pointless characters!!! Their romance in the first one was complex and beautiful! Mushu?! Mushu wasn't even there! One of the best characters! Instead he was a pointless, speechless phoenix... no character development, no lessons learned (although they tried to by repeating to exhaustion the words ""loyal, brave, true"" but words means nothing if you don't show it) I've learned so much more from the original one without anyone preaching anything!

My wife has watched it a 2nd time. In my opinion the best live action Disney film.

1774,audreylegault,Re-watch the original 1998 animated version instead of this,2,8 September 2020,"What a disappointment and waste of time and money on Disney's part. Wasted potential for an iconic feminist Disney animation and powerful story.
Sadly, the only good thing about this movie is the visuals.1. Where the hell is Mushu ? If you're going to tone down the magical/fairytale side of the animated version when bringing it to life, don't strip down the movie from one of its star and most loved characters to then replace it with a magical kite-looking pheonix and a witch (?!?!?). Nonsense.2. Where did all the depth of character and storyline go ? This sort of felt like a very tone-deaf ""look at all the cool fighting slow-motion tricks I've got/wannabe feminist"" film. Mulan's journey, unlike the original version, seems senseless and devoted of any profound emotion. She somehow is born with this inhumane ability to fight and do parkour which just defies the whole purpose of her journey and transformation shown in the 1998 film. In the original, she is courageous, defies all odds, develops into this powerful, witty protagonist (not karate kid warrior) that is motivated by her will to protect, not only her father, but China. You don't feel any of that in this remake.One of the most epic scenes of the animated version is when she FINALLY, after so much hard work, manages to make it up that pole. Now, she is just a born ninja who climbs a mountain when nobody else can because surprise surprise, she is the strongest and we knew it from the start.That moment she decided to let her hair down and tear down her armor in the middle of a war in the snowy mountains... my god. WHAT WAS THAT. Also, no one sees her save her companion while halting the fight with the avalanche which lessens the impact of her heroism and takes away all the magnitude of what she has just accomplished. Also why do her companions threaten to execute her if she ""shows her face again"" but then, 5 minutes later, decide to trust her entirely and let her lead the army into the emperor's palace ? So many things lack in logic and context. SO MANY THINGS.3. How many times can one say ""bring honor"" and ""chi"" in a 2 hour long film. Seriously, overdone.4. THE MUSIC. Oh my goodness, what happened to the music ? The original tracks are nothing less than iconic. They could have at least integrated instrumental versions of them (other than just adding instrumental ""Reflection"" to every suppose-to-be emotional scene).5. The acting... oh the acting. Terrible. The script is generic, boring, dull. This obviously does not help the actors, but jeez. Not only do interactions between characters just feel... uncomfortable, but the wannabe jokes are just terrible and awkward. Everyone's acting seems forced. No character building throughout the movie. You do not get attached to anyone, not even Mulan, not even her ""goofy"" friends. Wow I really missed Chien-Po, Yao and Ling from the 1998 version.
This movie felt like a very generic martial arts, Jackie Chan-style (without the fun and humour) film, lacking in any kind of tone, sentiment or Disney magic. The remake has no soul so watch the original.",Mulan

I'm not sure what their agenda was but obviously it was not to review this movie. I watched the movie and thought it was awesome. It followed a storyline that Disney reimagined. If you're looking for a movie that follows the exact cartoon this is not it but obviously that's not what Disney was looking for. Some movies are set for both adults and kids alike. This movie was set for adults the cartoon was set for kids. The individuals who gave this movie a bad review was obviously a kid back when the cartoon was first released. They were looking for the same experience that the cartoon gave. This movie follows the life of a female struggling in a male dominant society. It shows women that regardless of bias and prejudice they too can follow a successful path. It gives hope to young women to move forward in their dreams regardless of the struggles they may face. That is the message that they are trying to get across. That was the message that Mulan the cartoon was trying to get across. This is the message that was given to us today in this movie. We lose sight of the message because we want an emotional experience given to us by our childhood. That's not what this movie is for. It's to encourage women and to move forward in our society and move past our biases.,Mulan

1781,TheUnknownMovieCritic,Those remakes just keep getting worse.,3,10 December 2020,"I actually had a bit higher expectations for this movie than I have for other upcoming disney live action remakes because the trailers kind of seemed like this could be a new original interpretation of the original Mulan story which I thought was a good movie. Not outstanding but GOOD.
Then this movie came along and Disney made the people pay 30 dollars to only RENT Mulan 2020, so I had to wait a few months to watch it for free on Disney+. Now I finally did and I heard that some people thought that this movie is really bad since I had read and watched a couple of reviews when it first came out.
Well, that's my backstory on Mulan 2020. Let's start with the review.
Starting off with the positive aspects (since there aren't many) I have to say that the score of this movie is actually relly good. I always had a little weekness for traditional Asian music. The costume design is good as well, and most of the performances are pretty solid. Some action sequences were nice to look at and entertaining, others really weren't.
Sadly there isn't a single interesting character in the whole movie, including both Mulan and the antagonist.
The drama doesn't work in many scenes that are supposed to be emotional I guess and the story is told in a very choppy way. Most of the dialouges are boaring, the humor falls flat and there are many very stuped decisions within the plot that I'm not gonna spoil for you. There are many themes that are not executed well in this movie. The pacing is also way to slow. I also think that the editing of this movie is really bad in some scenes because they are not tied together that well.
I really didn't care about any character or plotline and during the third act of the movie I complete lost my interest and hoped that the movie would end soon and I would even care that much about all those things if the movie was entertaining. Then I could at least call it a guilty pleasure.
But even though I think this movie is really bad, if not awful, I didn't hate it and I definately didn't have a horrible time watching it. There were some aspects that just made it interesting enough for me to not hate it and I see some people having with it. I'd get it. If you don't really care that much about an engaging plot, interesting characters and a story that makes sence, feel free to check it out. You can watch it for free on Disney+, but please don't pay for it.Yes, I do think it's worse than the Lion King remake.",Mulan

I can see Disney's embition. they want it to be their change for historical and epic. but sadly the story still based on a fairy tale. that makes everything seems strange. it's not true and cruel enough. they filmed the war like a game. I wanted to laugh when seeing ten people rush out to chase the rouran. and meanwhile it's not fairy enough. so why don't you just film it like the original one since you hadn't even change your scription? oh I see. you wanted to promote the feminism again! I'm exhausted hollywood. I can see the reason they added xianniang the character. and why the scription became worse. the change the core from 'Mulan's growing' to 'how Mulan assure she is a woman' or 'be a woman'.

Barely any music at all.The comedy was GONE. It felt dark and not as light as the animated film.The best parts of the original animation were completely ignored and removed from this film. There were no goosebumps or feel-good moments in the film the way it was done in the animation.Everything aside from the fight scene at the end of the movie was a complete disappointment.The movie was okay but don't expect to see the Mulan you remember and love. This movie is simply a movie that is similar to the Mulan animation but nowhere near as excellent.The animated script was perfect and it shouldn't have been changed for this film. Beauty and the beast and the lion king hit the nail on the head because they stuck to the wonderful scripts and soundtracks that Disney created.Mulan missed the mark.",Mulan
1799,keeferliao,Not as bad as people make it,8,7 September 2020,"A lot of people are putting hate on this movie. I understand where it comes from, as most of people have watched the original Disney animation, which I consider one of my favorite movies of its time.Now if you look at the new Mulan, it has gotten rid of much of the goofy and fanatical characters and scenes (granted there is the shape shifting witch). I'm sad to see Mushu and Cricket go, but I'm also happy that the movie faces more realistic aspects of the original tale, where Women in Ancient Asia were disregarded as wives and daughters. How Mulan defied those original traditions of our culture has always been the core of the story, and I believe that this movie brings it justice. The actions scenes were good with interesting choreography and traditional floaty Kung fu seen in older eastern films.There are a few things that could be improved on, however. Some scenes felt devoid of any emotion, and I would have liked a few lines in Chinese with English subtitles.Overall, a better movie than I thought from all the reviews, and one worth seeing if you have spare time.",Mulan
1800,ranisharma-05307,Very slow and not to many special effects,1,5 September 2020,I am not sure why Disney went with this movie or what audiences they were targeting . For kids there are not very many wow special effects . For adults not to many action sequence. Movie runs at a slow pace . It's pictured beautifully so 1 Star for that . Not worth your time until this is the only movie you can watch and you are stuck on Mars and no other options .,Mulan

It's a disappointment despite having bright colors and rich action that Mulan doesn't breathe life into other areas, especially the plot or character development. Hoping a flawless female lead and cultural accuracies are enough to please the audience, 2020's Mulan doesn't get down to business to defeat the soulless, bland tone that embodies the live action remake.",Mulan
1804,brandonbzed-02534,Absolutely Emotionless and Empty,1,18 October 2020,"Unlike the disney cartoon, this was disneys worse remake yet. No mushu, crazy strong mary sue who fights every battle like its nothing, no journey to becoming who shes meant to be, she just has the powrr of 'chi' and can defeat anyone in combat from day 1. Battles are absolutely boring and horrible. No character has a purpose except mulan who defeats anyone in her path at ease, they added some fat guy named cricket to replace the cricket. Cringe. Even the beginning when she takes her fathers sword had zero emotion to it compared to the cartoon. Truly awful movie.",Mulan

Im not devoted to the original animated film, so I wasn't bothered by the divergences.

1810,andreicristianmoga,Better than rated,9,4 September 2020,"I encourage you to watch this film and to not be swayed by the swarm of whiny man-babies rating it so low and complaining about their ongoing childhoods in this section. Do not expect upon beginning it to see the exact same as the 1998 original. This is a more mature story and a closer insight on rigid societal systems and how they are historically unfair to certain categories. Despite what the 'member-days nostalgists spew, it is better, as it is closer to a real-life legend. While incorporating unrealistic elements, they can be tolerated, as all good stories change their form and style, while remaining true to their core message. Let us not forget that the original Mulan story was NOT written in 1998, but is so old and has become so archetypal that we still cannot pin its exact origins. To me, the 1998 film was both fun and a slap in the face of the real legend. They went the right way in the live-action remake, removing all of the childish jokes (including Mushu and his stand-up routine) and focusing on the legend and its message. It does right by the original story. Not a verbatim retelling of the 1998 story, for kids who forgot to grow up, but an outstanding example for all of us. As all great legends are.I do not give this film a full rating because of the untimely and improper release. It should have been further postponed, as it was already overdue. The format in which it is made available does it little justice, and the theatrical release would have also been impossible given our current worldwide situation. This compromise solution also somewhat compromises the experience of the film.Thank you for taking the time to read.",Mulan
1811,kimmareehardman,Disappointing,3,6 September 2020,As a remake of Mulan it's very disappointing and doesn't capture the essence of the story. This movie is loosely based on the movie we all know and love. It is beautifully film and cast well and if it was named something else it would be better for this movie. I didn't feel like I was watching Mulan. Totally understand making remakes things are going to be different but this just feels like it could have been any movie somewhat a little close to Mulan. I was more inspired by girl power and independence watching the cartoon version.,Mulan

1813,jacksunwei,Much better than I expected,8,8 September 2020,"Disney has converted a series of cartoons and Mulan is definitely not a bad one. Comparing to the Lion King, Mulan is much better. The action scenes are very exciting and the story is also very well told. I have to say it's not perfect, either. I'd say it's definitely worth the price in cinema, but at home, it depends...The explanation of chi isn't that clear, or it's even very confusing. To be honest, I'd rather not to mention chi if I were the director.I was hesitating previously because of the so many 1 star review. Once I started the movie, I actually enjoyed it a lot.==== End of review, below are side notes =====Then, I realized that lots of 1-star review was purely for political reasons.

I don't even want to start explaining because I hated almost everything.

It made me feel like I can be proud to be a girl. and where I'm from that's just not possible for girls. I hate that people keep comparing this film to the brilliant 1998 original film.

1823,paige-51,Lack of score,5,7 December 2020,My biggest complaint of this movie is the lack of Disney's signature score and soundtrack. Music can make you invested in the scene and feel the emotions. This movie is seriously lacking that. And the character build.,Mulan

I don't know who those people are but I think we watched different films. I knew well ahead of time that we wouldn't be getting any of the bangers from the original film, so I was ok with the lack of songs.. my thought was that they were trying to go for a more serious, more historically accurate/sensitive type of epic warrior tale. I was wrong, somehow I actually found it significantly more silly and ridiculous than the original(I LOVE the original but its an animated children's film so silliness is expected.) The first time we see her save herself from falling off the roof I thought... I'm gonna hate this.. and boy.. I really did. If you're going to watch it, wait until December and get it for free.

But being more personal, I grew up seeing mulan (1998) And a man inspired me, because she wanted to make her parents proud, but she wanted to do what she I wanted... Something that happened to me in my life, I always wanted to make my grandparents proud and do what I wanted, just like Mulan... And at the end of the film, mulan did what she wanted and got her parents' pride, In other words, although the story of animation was simple, it spoke to boys and girls. And we have to talk about the importance of representing Asian Americans in the film... (another great representation of an Asian American and the film The Farell With Awkwafina) So my friend this is a poor film without a soul.",Mulan

Yifei Liu played the role well but the story was a mess, with its shallow and bricolage storyline, and other stereotyped characters and settings about Chinese landscape and culture.

The acting is questionable as well, those soldiers look like they don't know what the hell they were doing. Honghui look terribly awkward, everything about their acting is just totally off. The fidgt scenes look just too fake! No way!

1844,yunfei_xu,Good reboot of original MULAN,10,6 September 2020,"As an Asian. I am very proud Disney can bring Mulan to my real life. I think rotten tomatoes gave it a CERTIFIED 80 score is very reasonable. It is worth $30 dollars of course.The senses are very beautiful. I now understand why it costs 200M dollars. And the actions are so cool, Very interested to see everyone's reaction when they see the movie at home or theatre. Although the whole story changed a lot from Disney Mulan 1998 but I still can see the same Mulan in every sense. The actor is very beautiful when she fights with the enemy. Even it is a action movie but children can still see very happy.Compared to origianl Mulan. her femail identity is been found in the middle of the movie. But that is what I think the most excited moment for this whole movie. A femail so brave to show who she is, face her fear and save her friends. Even she may be killed by her identity but nothing can stop her. That theme is more appropriate to current Hallwood trendency.Any way, I think it is the best Live-action Disney princess movie I ever seen. It is worth when you arrange a movie day with your familiy.

Don't worry if you have animation complex, many classic scenes and BGM will be reappeared.
Liu yifei's acting is very good, from a young girl, after a variety of experiences, grow into a soldier. The eyes are funny. The scene is very atmospheric, almost all live action, Gansu Danxia, geothermal, snow mountain, palace and bustling street scene, all reflect Disney's intentions.

If you were looking to see romance, you will be disappointed. If you were looking for a funny dragon, well....Just watch the cartoon.However, if you want to see Disney's unique take on martial arts films and Chinese folklore and culture, then you will be delighted in every way. If you're looking for a strong female lead, everybody was kung-fu fighting, and a meaningful story about self-discovery, honor and family, (that is very Chinese) then this will be a fun movie.I'm giving it 9 stars because a part of me did miss the cartoon, from 1998, which was 22 years ago. Let's just say watching the same exact thing, shot for shot, while nostalgic, is always going to fall short of the original. Kudos to Disney for surprising us with something new, and a character that is both meaningful to the new audience, and still captivates us old-timers like when we were children.Also - costumes, locations, character development, music score, fight choreography (anyone who grew up watching 70s Wu-Tang and 90s martial Arts movies will LOVE this movie), many of these elements made it a Mulan to remember.",Mulan

I watched it for what it was, a movie adapted to a new generation with a live action make over. The fight scenes were remnants of classic Chinese martial art style and the story did take a while to move in parts, but what movie doesn't take that route. Visually stunning. Great cast and enjoyable for a family night or a bit of new age nostalgia you know. A grain of rice can tip the scale, just watch and don't judge harshly.",Mulan

For example, when I watched The King Lion (despite that is my favorite cartoon and movie) all the parts of the film where more or less the same of the cartoon, and in many case the sentences too were the same!So ya, I cannot say that I didn't like completely, I gave 6 indeed, but I had much more expectations.",Mulan

this movie was fantastic! and so much better than another china like movies,
it was very mature but still filled up with the same disney magic,
Liu Yifei was absolutly stand out actor, she did great with Mulans character and the fact she did the most of the stunts at least just shows how amazing she is, and than they added a witch, the idea of showing how mulan could take a completely different path to be free, Mulan showed her that its possible to be good and still be yourself.overall, Mulan was very emotonal, powerful, I just loved it,

1869,knthdfuu,Enjoyable,7,21 September 2020,I actually liked the movie. So glad it didn't have the musical number to be honest. It was very entertaining. Only thing is that I wish the fighting scenes were longer. People need to understand this IS NOT a live action of the animated. It's a live action retelling. If you can separate the two you will enjoy the movie. Very well done Disney and team on their decisions,Mulan

1874,jcjalandoni-59442,A Disney Live Action based on a LEGENDARY STORY,9,15 November 2020,"Let me start by saying if you expected this live-action version as a straight frame by frame ""remake/carbon copy of the animated movie by Disney, stop reading here. This to me seems closer to the legendary story of Mulan, a person if she was ONE person or perhaps an amalgamation of female warriors throughout Chinese History. The story is brought to life without the usual Dance and Song that usually calls to the viewer you are watching a Disney movie. I think this was a bold and fresh take on the story as a whole. The actors chosen were thoughtful and if you have watched Martial Arts Films in the last 30 years, you will recognize more than a few legends in the film.The film is mard by political issues that in no small part costed the Studio some $$$ and marked for audience loss. I will leave to you the reader to research this part. I put it here only as a mention because I think the reviews by others is a way to tarnish the film as punishment for the actions of actors and studio alike not the quality of the film and the storytelling.The acting is very good in my opinion. The action is superb, the pace is excellent, and the casting is extraordinary (NO WHITE-WASHING AT ALL) A Chinese legendary story acted by Chinese actors.)I hope you the reader will take my words to heart and watch the film. You may completely disagree with me and that is fine, I am not a film critic by trade. I am a movie lover and history obsessed person. I think this is a great mix of the two and wonderful for the family as Disney intended.
This is not the only good Mulan film out there but this is a great one from the Animation to Action Genre.",Mulan
1875,charmomder,Doesn't compare to the original but doesn't stand on its own,4,5 September 2020,"Great framed shots. Costume and makup is on full display but thats about all this film has going for it. This movie is void of any humor one would expect in a family film. Memerable songs there are none. In vast contrast to the original. But even on its own merit, this movie does not stand up. There is very little interaction with fellow soldiers to make believing a strong bond was built between them and Mulan. The way the soldiers and Captain come to entrusting Mulan is laughably absurd. Overall not worth the money spent to take the family to theaters to watch but for a movie to watch at home okay.",Mulan
1876,rrtawk,"Disney, Let's Get Down to Business",3,23 November 2020,"Disney has been a universal company that has implanted role models and ideals into the mind of almost every child. The characters, the music, the morals, and the themes of Disney movies have played a crucial role in developing life values for numerous generations. Lately, Disney has been remaking many of their classic movies into live-action films such as Aladdin, The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, and many others. Mulan was the most recent live-action remake that was released in September of this year. The original 1998 Disney animated version is one of my favorite Disney movies, so this remake was exciting news. As I grew up, I watched this movie countless times; the characters and catchy songs became a cherished part of my childhood memories. Hearing about the new live-action remake, I was beyond excited to see it again in its new form and reward my memory by recalling the events in live-action. My excitement was exchanged with disappointment when I learned that my favorite parts of the movie were to be omitted and that the plot was to be greatly altered. In short, every time the plot diverged from that of the cartoon, it had further deviated from what I hoped it would be. This movie fell short of every expectation I had; it certainly did not bring any honor to us all. I would not recommend the 2020 live-action remake of Mulan because of the exclusion of lovable characters and the elimination of the classic songs of the original.To begin, lovable characters such as the comedic Mushu, Cricket, Shang, and Mulan's three army friends have been removed from the 2020 remake and replaced with dull characters who did not add anything to the movie. The little red dragon was replaced with a CGI phoenix, who unlike Mushu, does not even have a personality, as it just seems to appear and float around during some parts of the film. There was also the addition of a witch character, which to me, just seemed confusing and unnecessary. Understandably, Disney tried to make this movie more realistic and align more closely with the traditional Chinese legend; however, it was quite a disappointing revision. What is so realistic about a person who can turn into a bird and fly away? These modifications were as ""mysterious as the dark side of the moon."" These represent a few examples of grievances about the undesired alteration of characters in the remake and listing them all would offer enough material for writing a book.In addition to the alteration of characters, all songs from the animated version were removed. To me, this was one of the most disappointing changes. Since I first saw the cartoon version of Mulan as a child, it has held a special place in my heart; the catchy and engaging music was a crucial part of the experience. Despite already knowing that Disney had taken out all of the musical numbers that were in the 1998 film, while watching the live-action remake, I found myself anticipating them with a false hope that the nonexistent songs could save the movie from its unflattering plot and bland characters. The absence of the universally admired tunes made the 2020 version devoid of personality. Viewers could not see the fun and memorable side of the characters that were known and loved in the cartoon. Without the musical numbers, this remake was simply not a film worth fighting for.By playing around with the characters and cutting out the classic songs, the overall feeling of the movie was just different, and not in a good way. The characters lost their well-loved personalities with the lack of engaging and heartwarming melodies. For example, the removal of beloved comedic figures, such as Mushu, also took away from the overall charm of the film. After going into this movie with much anticipation and high expectations, these disappointing modifications left me with a cold feeling of emptiness that only the original version of Mulan could fulfill. Although Disney offered this remake as an upgrade from the cartoon to join the list of other live-action remakes, to me, these changes denuded the film of its original appeal and felt like a downgrade. While watching the 2020 version, I asked myself, ""When will the reflection of the original film show in this remake?"" I tried my best to enjoy this movie, I really did, but I just could not. It is difficult to recommend this movie to anyone who has watched the original Disney animated version, as it will fall short of any expectations you may have as it did for me. If you are truly in the mood to watch Mulan and are hoping for a cinematic masterpiece, I would just stick to the original.",Mulan
1877,laurenagilbride,dishonor on your cow disney,4,6 January 2021,"This movie would have been amazing stand alone but the fact that this was supposed to be the live action of the classic movie just ruined it. there no songs, all the characters have changed names, and mushu is gone. you can't take away the comic relief no matter how serious the movie. And they names a character cricket to hide the fact they took away out favorite bug from the movie. I grew up watching this movie. Biggest disappointment.

1879,peces-12003,EVERYONE NEEDS A SECOND CHANCE,8,6 September 2020,"Let's face it, we all expected a live action from Mulan (although no one asked for them), I think it is necessary that this version be valued for what it is, a version of the poem / legend and not of the animated movie as such, maybe some characters are missing or the songs would have been necessary, but its instrumental version of these remains, it is OBVIOUS that it was made to be shown in cinemas, and that electronic devices can limit the experience and interaction that one has with the movie, there is a scene or two that although they took things a bit far to the point of looking unrealistic (like Mulan chasing a chicken and then ""fly"" through the air) , the cinematography is beautiful, it has too many well achieved shots, and I think we are all here for it, I did not feel the empowerment that the animated version left me except for 2 scenes, but yeah, i don't think it should get the hate it's getting, everyone did a good job, it's just the fact that paying $ 30 to watch it on streaming isn't worth it, but let's be empathic, it was to recover the budget, the quarantine left many businesses in ruins and it limit our experience of enjoying a movie on a big screen and a good sound, it is what is missed the most.",Mulan

1884,aromad20,One of the best Walt Disney movies,10,18 October 2020,"Mind-blowing fighting scenes, picturesque scenes, beautiful story-telling. The overall IMDb rating of 5.4 is not at all justified for this incredibly beautiful movie. One of the reason for this poor rating is because people compare it with the old animation movie. I wonder why is it necessary to compare every movie with its old animated version? Why cannot one just watch such a movie with a completely fresh perspective?
Shame on people who rate such a wonderful work of art with 1 star or 2 star? People accept magic and all sorts of unrealistic things in an animation, but when such components are added to movies with real characters, people do not like it. I think as an audience we need to accept it as another work of art, judging it by the acting of the characters, the freshness in story telling and beautiful direction. Please stop comparing it to the animation movie and giving it such a bad rating. This movie deserves much more.",Mulan
1885,isabelsstevens,Don't watch! You will just be disappointed!,1,7 September 2020,"This movie is nothing like the animated movie. I'm very disappointed because I thought Disney would make it Similar like the animated movie. Just like how they did with Aladdin beauty and the beast and they still made maleficent very good.
There is no Mushu there is no Shang, There is a stupid Phoenix and it's just overall ridiculous.
I hope Disney learns her lesson to stick with the movie that everybody loves because nobody will like this it is one of their very most disappointed movies that I have ever seen in my life and I am a long life Disney fan.
Hopefully Disney will be able to redeem themselves.
This movie doesn't even have a good launch farm she lives in this big old house with all these other people and that is disappointing.

If you're going into this thinking its going to be a children's comedy then sure you're going to be disappointed. However, if you're a fan of the old school kung fu movies or even the crouching tiger hidden dragon film it runs in a similar vein. With the impossible high flying action sequences and nods to the witchcraft (think white-haired witch) it is a great movie to introduce your children into this magical genre.

Watching this movie in today's day and age where we are in an active discussion to remind and show girls and women the social and cultural constraints placed on them, I think it really resonated with us and we felt inspired and left us with fire in our bellies!
The lead actress was awesome, along with the rest of the cast, and the filmography was great.
Please don't go off the 1 star reviews, a lot of these are people comparing to the original, or frankly ticked off they had to pay extra on Disney+.

1889,shuhuiwan,I'm offended,2,7 September 2020,"Never interested in writing movie reviews but I have to say some thing about this one. It's not just a matter of good/bad movie anymore, I feel I've been insulted both culturally and intellectually.
I've never seen a movie with that much stereotype of the Chinese culture. If anyone was a bit serious about the cultural content and did a decent research, this wouldn't have happened. By research, I mean something more than just a poem describing Mulan. (Not to mention how awkward it is for trying to fit the content of the poem, word for word, into the movie) The original cartoon was a million times better than this one. How did Disney manage to backwards on cultural representations with lighting speed while have this all Asian cast?
And to be honest, this plot is so bad. I don't even theres any actor/actress that could have saved it. The two points was for Yifei Liu. She's beautiful. The witch was played by my favorite actress. Now I'm having serious doubts on her ability to pick roles. This is the intellectually insulting part. The witch character is so dumb and stupid that after the first line you can guess what she's gonna do and how she's gonna end up. It could have been much better if the Phoenix and the hawk were merged into one character.
I thought this couldn't be worse than The Lion King. I was wrong. This type of ""original"" is not worthy of my time and money. It will receive a much higher score if everything gets copied over from the original Mulan. No new elements or surprises. Those have seriously insulted me",Mulan

1903,arunitakar,Missing all the good stuff from the original,2,4 September 2020,"Cinematography was nice, credits music was really good! A few decent easter eggs in the dialogue and at least the cast wasn't whitewashed. That's where the pros end for me.Songs or no songs, the story shed all the lovable, fun moments the animated movie had. It was a serious, somber film where important, deep topics were sort of just presented rather than revealed through character and plot development. Mulan's character wasn't as relatable because of this. While the animated version had her be a normal person who worked extra hard, struggled like heck, and use her mind to overcome challenges, much of the live-action Mulan's skills was just chalked up to her innate chi. [Why? Who even knows? Sounds of exasperation].I do not think the actors are bad but the movie seemed to be lacking emotional depth on some choices (for example, the quickness at which the army accepted Mulan being revealed or the witch's change of heart seemed rushed). But this may be due to the director's questionable choices...other questionable choices include: excluding the highly popular comic relief, Mushu, and having a phoenix guide instead, leaving out Mulan's turning point in the army (y'all remember the epic scene during I'll make a man out of you where Mulan climbs that tall post with heavy medallions around her wrist to retrieve that arrow?), making the lucky cricket a random soldier named Cricket, a sister who is scared of spiders (quite possibly to only cause the bug uproar at the matchmaker's), and no cray, slightly thirsty, but super lovable grandmother?Not much more to say. Just going to have to rewatch the animated version again.",Mulan

I agree that I was iffy about them not including Mushu, music, etc. However, after educating myself on Chinese culture and that Mushu was disrespectful, I understand their decision. Like stated, this movie is not supposed to be light-hearted with a bunch of fun songs. It's about war. It's about a warrior. They did a great job twisting the story into their own version, while honoring the original Mulan poem and the animated movie. As a fan of the original Mulan, I am beyond proud of this film. I laughed, I cried, and I ended the movie feeling so grateful to have experienced it. This was definitely worth the wait and paying the extra money to see it. I highly recommend!",Mulan

The main issue i had was how a live action movie could possibly be less realistic than the cartoon, the original is a movie set in reality with a bit of mythical stuff but this one was just off its head and i think it tried to do too much to distance itself from the original it lost its way.

You can't include Mushu because you want it to be more realistic/traditional but you can add a shapeshifter into the plot? What? There's no Disney magic like the original Mulan (1998) that was beloved by fans. No humor, no songs, or the Disney feel to it. If it didn't have the name ""Mulan"" as its title then it would have been just another mediocre movie at best, forgettable but not terrible. But for a Live Action remake of the beloved classic ""Mulan"", absolute trash. Save your $30 and 2 hours of your life that you'll never get back. I mean I don't know how else to convey it but... man was it awful.",Mulan

1928,contact-02345,"Amazing in some ways, flawed in others.",7,4 September 2020,"Mulan (the original animated) has always been a personal favourite of mine, from the witty jokes and comments of Mushu to the plot empowering equality between a highly divided target audience of the time.
The motion picture remake (Mulan 2020) was outstanding in many ways but uncomparable to the original at the same time. Disney took on a much more mature approach with the live action remake and I think it worked well. Lion King showed us that frame by frame remakes were not going to work well and I think that this movie found a sweet spot (still not without its faults).
At times the movie did seem bland and lost character, I personally was not a fan of how disney portrays Mulan as more of a ""super hero"" rather than the intelligent witty female lead she was in the original.
What did work well - a lot more than I was expecting. Originally I was not very happy about the idea of Mushu no longer being in the movie but after watching the story arch and the clearly more mature audience nature the movie is targeted for I can completely see why this decision was made. The soundtrack has to be one of the best that Disney has ever done, personally I would place it above some of the more ""singy"" disney originals however others may differ. The movie also holds my highest respects in terms of cinematography, choreography however in parts the CGI just felt a bit off for me - however still not awful.
I would recommend this film to friends and family, however I would recommend they use my account rather than paying the £19.99 early access fee in the UK (nice one disney).",Mulan
1929,bartlettisabel,"Amazing, and pays tribute to legend",9,4 September 2020,"I think Disney has done an amazing job with this movie. The storyline pays tribute to the true Chinese legend and have done a fantastic job. The cast was well-selected and I believe Mulan was a revolutionary movie and was a breath of fresh air. Growing up with Disney, I was worried it would be nothing like the cartoon, but I was wrong to be worried. Whilst the movie isn't the same, it still has aspects that reminds you of the cartoon. It is not a childish animation, but a true work of art that can allows people to appreciate the legend. Disney has outdone itself once again, and anyone who says otherwise has no idea what they are talking about and are holding onto the past.",Mulan

1932,golem-11037,Amazing Movie! A Different Take,10,5 September 2020,"Mulan in my opinion was a excellent film that strays away from its animated counterpart in great fashion. I love how the film stayed more true to the actual Chinese Legend rather than the G rated animated film.Yes, There are definitely less jokes in this film compared to the animated version. But keep in mind this a PG-13 film that revolves around WAR, honor and truth. This version does a great job of representing the actual fear of being in war unlike the animated film.
It really does convey a different tone when the characters aren't all silly and singing. This leads me to my next point.There are NO singing/songs.
I'll be honest. When i heard that there wouldn't be any songs it was almost a deal breaker. How could we forget the classics like a ""Reflection,"" ""Make a Man out of You"" and ""A Girl Worth Fighting for."" But ohhhhh i would be lying if i said it wasn't enjoyable to hear the instrumental in the background or hear it referenced in the dialogue. Again, i'm happy that the movie strayed away from singing and focused on conveying a vibe more suitable too war.Does it focus too much on Feminism?
Simply put. As a asian male. No, No i don't think the film is shoving a strong female character down our throats. It's simply about a woman who secretly takes her old and weak fathers position in war. The film also doesn't convey the idea that men are bad. The only man that seems even the slightest bit misogynistic is Bori Khan, and he's the bad guy! He's the one who treats the ""Witch,"" as his instrument to get what he wants. Even still, the movie displays strong male characters too! Who appear either equal to or stronger than Hua Mulan at first!The Other Big Changes!
No Mushu - Mushu was used a comic relief. This is no longer the cartoony film that everyone is so use to. Everyone complained about Lion King being the exactly same. I'd say that people should appreciate these changes.
""The Witch"" - I don't think people understand that the Witch is actually a great character. The idea of Mulan and her contrasting yet being so similar is amazing. It pushes development of Mulan as a character more.In conclusion, The Movie is great. I recommend people to stop comparing it to the animated film and expect a cartoony and goofy film.",Mulan
1933,phillip-84880,"No Mushu, doesnt climb the mast, no ancestors this is horrible",1,4 September 2020,"I couldnt imagine a worse remake, all the best parts of the original left out, zero singing, mushu is missing, this is a horrible childrens war movie so pathetic...if you LOVE the original dont waste ur time with this garbage",Mulan
1934,janedeee,Utterly disappointing - and I really wanted to like it.,2,5 September 2020,"The good: great cast, nice visual shots and cinematographyThe bad: the screenplay was total crap. Worse than crap.Spoilers:
-Scenes that were meaningful and funny in Mulan are nowhere to be found. I could deal with no Mushu, but replacing it with a phoenix that randomly shows up and float about? Ugh.-They replaced the grandmother with a sister, which adds nothing to the film.-They added a new villain, the witch, which could have been completely omitted. I see that they attempted to do something cool and interesting to make it different from the original. It failed miserably.-Scenes were rushed. We hardly got to see the soldiers really bond. Ling, Yao, and Chien Po have few lines and are forgotten quickly. Their progress doesn't really evolve into anything better from the film scenes. Mulan doesn't earn the respect of the others like she did in the original.-they cut Shang's character into two, which messes up the storyline and doesn't hold any emotional weight when they find the village is burned. It lacked any meaningful scenes. In the original, Shang finds his father has died and a doll is left behind. They take the time to mourn.-Mulan and her love interest don't share any meaningful scenes together.-the whole ""chi"" theme doesn't add anything because it seems like it was thrown in. ""Mulan has chi. She is a good fighter. When she lies about being a man, it makes her weak. "" It just makes it more convoluted.-stupid cliches in the film. ""4 ounces can carry 1000 pounds.""
-omitting all the meaningful lines that worked (cherry blossom adversity, the mountain doesn't bow to the wind)
-construction fighting scene, not even gonna go into detail about how bad the whole setup was. Basically, the villain captured the emperor and tied him up. He sets up a hot vat and plans to melt the emperor.I would rather have had them make the film exactly like the original than have them crap on everything that was good about it.",Mulan

1938,y-65828,be worthy of watching,8,5 September 2020,"As a remake of a classic animation, the live-action mulan is eligible for both a teen-oriented audience and a teen-oriented audience. The color of the film is bright, which may be due to the age of the audience. In terms of plot, it is similar to the mulan story we usually know. The core difference between the film and animation is the psychological change process of the protagonist, from passive to active, from being discovered to being a woman, to honestly facing his identity as a woman. In keeping with the trend of The Times, from who I am to who I am, it's not bad. Of course, if you start with an adult perspective on a movie, it can be a bit disappointing.",Mulan

Everything that made you love the original (the music, the quirky characters, the story) it's gone. The music I can understand. They wanted to preserve Chinese culture. But the characters that we loved? Gone. Replaced with shallow or new characters that add zero depth or purpose to the film. Why is there suddenly a witch? They removed iconic scenes like the hair cutting, the first glance at Shan Yu (who isn't called Shan Yu btw), and so many more amazing scenes. In my opinion this entire film just falls short.

A lot of the kitschy musical numbers and larger-than-life lizard-dragon voices by Eddie Murphy will claim it's own ""honor"" and in its own right...this breathtaking reimagining of Mulan is a sight for sore eyes in a world of giving audiences what they expect versus what we need. We needed Mulan to take a much more mature stance as the audience itself matured. And the director/producers did this with poise, elegance and with taste. Major critics have knocked this down quite a few pegs but it's the heart of the story itself that lifts it back up despite the odds. Quite like Mulan herself.",Mulan

It packs all the right punches and teaches so many lessons to us along with the main three and the fourth at the end to most importantly be who we are and not hide our emotions and rise like the Phoenix. This movie I knew going in was not the remake of the original animated classic but it does tell the same story in a new and interesting way that feels real. The lead actress was amazing as Mulan, she did a fantastic job along with the rest of the cast. Donnie Yen and Jet Li both are given good roles and time to showcase their talents without ever overshadowing the main character.

If you watched this as a kid, transition to an adult with viewing this, and you will enjoy it more looking through the view and concept as an adult.

She has may be a total of 5 expressions through the whole movie. One cannot feel her fear, anxiety, determination and bravery. This acting deficit is to some extent helped by the supporting cast.

She wasn't suppose to be like a Jedi. What I loved was that originally she was clumsy, a disgrace, screwed things up, and she transforms into a warrior later and we get to witness that triumphant transformation. The Matchmaker scene and her decision to leave should have been more nostalgic, even if they did a couple cash-grab scenes I think people would have preferred a bigger nod to those. It wouldn't have killed them to add more musical instrumental to the songs too.Overall it was good, but not epic the way I was hoping to see. I wanted to love it and didn't.",Mulan

I am so pleased with the background music and those beautiful scenes.I saw many reviews with one or two points complaining about no dragon and cricket in the movie.

1988,tina-67479,Amazing,10,5 September 2020,"The wait is over, finally get to watch this masterpiece.
Yifei! She's so great in action scene. I feel the power behind her desire to play a role the females could idolize.
It's a movie which I can watch for more than three times! But the only thing is, that I can't see it on the cinema.",Mulan
1989,pennydreadful-61047,Wonderful remake,10,5 September 2020,"Awesome, feel good remake of a Disney classic. Im a fan of the original and I loved the everything about this remake. Don't listen to the bad reviews and go watch it and decide for yourself. I feel like all the bad reviews are from people so hard up, you wonder why they watch movies in the first place.",Mulan
1990,nickdownes,Outstanding,9,5 September 2020,Absolutely loved this. If you've gone into this thinking it'll be the same as the original you will be disappointed but for me as stand alone movie it was absolutely outstanding,Mulan

1993,JossieLuna,Don't listen to bad reviews,7,5 September 2020,People are really expecting it to be just like the animated version and while I love the original version and I couldn't help my self to compare both while watching it I realized I really liked this version a lot. There are certain parts that were more effective in the original version like the outing of Mulan as a men and perhaps the way that Mulan came back to her father and apologized. But aside of that it was very well done and felt very much like watching an oriental style film. It was beautiful aesthetically and the action scenes looked very neat.,Mulan
1994,talgilboa,Excellent,9,5 September 2020,"Excellent movie. Dont expect to see the original animated movie!
I thought that this live action interpretation for the original movie is great.
Unlike the other disney live action adaptations this was different and refreshing. I very much liked the adaptations for beauty and the beast and the lion king but they were almost exactly the same and frankly i prefer the originals.
The changes from the original movie complimented the live action movie in the best way. The character building was just enough that i could relate to mulan and her relationship with her friends and family.
Nothing in the movie overcast the main issues which are girl power and family.
Great effects, great acting, great production
You should definitely see it!",Mulan
1995,caitlinalflower,It's not the original but that's ok,8,5 September 2020,"A beautifully shot epic story; it has none of the musical elements, but it doesn't need them. If you compare it to the original from your childhood you'll be disappointed however the movie itself is a fresh look at Mulan's story.",Mulan

1998,hqgjrdum,"Corporate, Corporate",3,5 September 2020,"Liu Yifei is upstaged by Gong Li. My favourite review of the movie that I think summarises it well is that ""is a movie created by committee"", it tries not to offend anyone so much that it lessens the plot, prevents character development and makes everything a bit rigid. What Disney has tried to do is to copy the formula of the force from ""Rey's"" character in Star Wars, but it doesn't quite work. But for a movie that is meant to inspire a generation of young girls, all it says is you can be equal in a mans world but never at the top.",Mulan
1999,rizangchar,"Lights, Camera, Action 🎬",10,5 September 2020,"In a flash, I was greeted by the film's phenomenal and breathtaking cinematography. Stunning location, majestic scenery, detailed and colorful work of art altogether captures the whole aura of historic China. By then, my expectation were met in every sense of the word ""quality"". ""Oh, it's going to be a good one!"" I thought.For the most part I noticed the traditional or rather historical role the film creator was taking on when they omitted all of the animated film's musical and witty characters. Unfortunately but fortunately they kind of tweaked the story line just a tiny bit which I came to appreciate as you do not want to foresee every single detail from the classic animated film. I learned this from watching the remake of Lion King. Overall, the actress did a great job with her action-packed stunt sequence which was the highlight of the movie. The film creator successfully directed more of a significant film leading up to Mulan's journey rather than input the use of comedy as seen in the animated Mulan. It made sense. A must-see. I demand a Part 2.
P.S mushu is in there but not in a way you thought he was.",Mulan
2000,wykubpuzh,A Fantastic Retelling of The Ballad of Mulan,10,5 September 2020,"Disney has said time and time again that this is NOT a remake of their 90s film Mulan. But that this is a story that aligns more with the authentic tellings of Mulan.The fight sequences are beautiful and not full of blood and gore. The overall feel of the movie is of honor and family - something that is held in high regard in the Chinese culture (so it makes sense).Personally, I did miss the hint of romance That I would have loved but I appreciate how it was omitted because the soldiers view Mulan as their equal and therefore would not seek romance.",Mulan
2001,frank_da_frog,Beautiful. Awesome. Badass.,10,5 September 2020,"While still paying homage to the original I loved the changes they made. It's more accurate and really puts a lot more emphasis on the roles women had which makes Mulan's path that much more amazing and badass! The movie score, cinematography, casting, costumes, set was stunning.",Mulan

This added its own twists to the classic tale I love and you know, I really enjoyed it.Niki Caro deserves all the credit! Fantastic Director.",Mulan
2004,justincarpita,Thought this was a perfect adaptation,10,5 September 2020,"I have watched the original Mulán growing up and now this version. I loved that they didn't make an exact duplication of the movie like they did with The Lion King & Aladdin. The story, the music, the cinematography all kept me entertained until the end. I thought the message about strong women was great - and I didn't get the overwhelming pandering towards 'wokeness'. If you want to be entertained, watch a movie that you can enjoy with the kids, and finally see a remake the way Disney should have been making these remakes all along - then Mulan is the movie to watch!!",Mulan
2005,thelordmagus,Entertaining - subversive propaganda (if you are CCP),8,5 September 2020,"As a Kiwi I watched this for the promise of NZ scenery and the feel good factor. Immediately, this film announced itself as promoting a feminist hero role. The PC stereotypes are heavy handed - not very credible but for the 'Chi"" magic.. If you understand this work as a piece in the larger subversion of (traditional) Communist Chinese values, then you can appreciate it's value. There is this emotive appeal to family honour and protecting the Emperor. The cinematography is good, though I'd prefer some less wide aperture on the scenic backgrounds. The lighting is good. Sound is good. Has quality production values. Overall, almost predictable story line, but well executed and entertaining. I suspect a bunch of the negative ratings on this film have come from CCP NPCs.",Mulan
2006,sellabs,Really good but different than the original.,10,5 September 2020,Reading a lot of negative reviews - most are just trolls complaining about either how expensive it was (but forgot to check if they went to a movie theater it would cost the same plus you would see it only once) and how Disney has some sort of communist party agenda Cause of this year. I mean come on seriously? Mulan by Disney has been around for decades.I mean a kick azz female role was amazing - but some people in reviews seem to despise for whatever reason. Anyways...Now for the real meat - Beware Mulan fans. This is not exactly like the original cartoon series. So if that's what you're expecting then don't get mad. I actually liked it that way because otherwise it would be boring.There were parts of it like when Mulan saves the day but no one seemed to know about it - I wasn't happy about. Or if they did it was removed or skipped over. Anyways for a Mulan fan it was 9/10 as long as you understand it's different than the original.,Mulan
2007,denlin-27948,Solid film worth watching,7,5 September 2020,"I'm surprised by how many people that seem to think that Mulan is a Disney invented character like Mickey Mouse. This film is accused by many reviewers of spoiling the Mulan story but the 1998 Mulan film from Disney is actually the one strayed from the original Mulan legend .... but no one complained then. So please stop whining and enjoy the film for the artistry that it is. In no way is this a bad film. It's well acted, well cast and well filmed. And just to be clear - I love the -98 version but apart from the same high-level story-line, this is a different movie altogether. I am really surprised that many reviewers can't make that distinction. This no cartoon, It's a live action movie. Not all films are targeting kids and teenagers and this movie is clearly targeting a more mature audience.",Mulan
2008,athaliabeatrice,Don't trust the other people review,8,5 September 2020,"First thing, dont trust the review. The film is way better and absolutely astonishing for me. The different storyline from the cartoon make us wondering about the next. This film is worth to watch 💪",Mulan
2009,jackarriss,This was pretty good,9,5 September 2020,"Sure, the movie isn't a shot by shot remake but it was pretty good. The music composers did a fantastic job, Liu Yifei was amazing and the dialogue wasn't as cringey as i thought it would be, i walked into the movie with high hopes and came out impressed and suprised. The movie is great imo. Give it a chance and see for yourself.",Mulan

2011,cozet-00340,Boring script+bad acting,3,5 September 2020,"Since Mulan was one of my favorite Disney movies, I was excited to see this movie. I didn't mind the new story twist but it is really really badly executed. I am also deeply shocked and disappointed with the script and acting. The actors seems to be reading from screens with little expressions and emotions there and the script is so shallow and cheesy to say the least. It seems they did work alot on the costumes and all but a total fail in delivering the story.",Mulan
2012,rosisarroz,As heartwarming as the cartoon,10,5 September 2020,"I've read many negative reviews about the movie, so I decided to create an IMDb account to share my thoughts.

2013,amelia-30222,"I love it! Beautifully made, inspiring and touching 10/10",10,5 September 2020,"Watched it with no expectations and just allows myself to be taken into this beautiful and immersive movie. I loved that it's different to the animation! Why would we want to watch the exact same thing? So what if it's different and there's no Mushu or Crikee? The production is beautiful, the costumes stunning and such a feast on the eyes. In my opinion, the lead did her role justice and the whole cast was great. Not sure what people are complaining about, honestly. So much hard work and love was poured into it and it shows! I saw a reviewer call the worst movie of 2020? Wow, really? That's very low and uncalled for! I watched it with another group of family, we were all thoroughly entertained for a Saturday night in. I urge everyone to watch it with an open mind... you'll enjoy it for sure.",Mulan

2015,donaldhou,"Crouching Mulan, Hidden Phoenix",8,5 September 2020,"I'll give this a positive review. The film reminded me of Crouching Tiger, Hero, House of Flying daggers, which I found surprising for a Disney Film. The final battle with the villain (hello Jason Lee from Jungle Book 1994) was something right out of mid-2000s Chinese warrior movie. I enjoyed the additions of magic, chi, and a witch. I enjoyed that Mulan still saved her battalion with an avalanche. I liked the cute barracks scenes where Mulan has to still hide her breasts from all these men.The only thing that urked me, since this is PG-13, was lack of blood. I'm so utterly used to bloody pitched battle scenes, that a lack of blood in battle is noticeable. But this is a Disney movie, so c'est la vie.",Mulan
2016,acwdance-84241,This was an amazing movie,10,5 September 2020,"I really loved this movie the effects, the acting, and the action was outstanding. I think this really told the real story of mulan and I'm really glad I got to see it. This movie is a MUST WATCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Mulan

Sorry to say but this one is one to miss.",Mulan
2019,ericamarieplummer,Utterly boring,3,5 September 2020,"I was excited to watch the live action version of Mulan. The animated version was a family favorite for years. This remake is nothing like the original version. This was utterly boring and literally almost put me to sleep. There are none of the great songs that Disney is known for in the animated version. Mulan has a sister. What? Magical powers? This is just nonsense. Even the action scenes in this film were boring. Not to mention all of the key characters that were completely left out of the film. Where is the relief humor from Mushoe and the rest of the army gang? Nonexistent, because they were completely excluded from the movie. This remake was terrible.",Mulan
2020,jasonhbanks,I wanted to like it....,5,5 September 2020,"Kids will like it. Maybe.Fighting was ok. Pace was horrible. No real depth of characters. Movie was really cheesy. I wasn't expecting it to be like the animated classic. I actually really liked the live action Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast as well and appreciate their differences from their animated counterparts.-Storyline wasn't well thought out. Started well. But their desire to have over powered women characters really dampened the story in my opinion. To me it would have been a more powerful message if Mulan overcame her obstacles because of hard work, intelligence and grit, not because she was born with chi powers. The witch just was out of place for me. She was pointless.
-But if you're going to have powers, fight scene could have been MUCH BETTER. Battle sequences were ok at best. With some having no wow factor or we're just dumb. At one point I said, ""Ok Mulan has Ultra Instinct...smh""
-Ending was just dumb. Character decisions were questionable. Very questionable. The witch lol",Mulan

2022,alexronald-30719,"Wow, this is just awful",2,5 September 2020,"I'm giving this a '2' because it is a truly awful film.The main actress simply can't act and a lot of the dialogue is very obviously scripted. It is impossible to lose yourself and forget that you are watching movie (if that makes sense). Disney have being going downhill for a while but this is definitely a point that it would be difficult to 'beat'. I hope they can improve going forward. Another thing about this film is that it is impossible to be on the side of the heroine (and the other 'good guys'). They appear to be moral but there are things they do that no moral person could agree with. It's certainly a very 'shiny' film but you can see quite clearly where they have copied from other, better films. The previous Mulan was disappointing but this os dismal. Avoid!",Mulan

2025,dakota-43387,What is this?,3,5 September 2020,"This movie was an absolute failure in my mind. The acting was off, the visuals were clunky and off, the choreography in fighting was off, the humor just wasn't there, and this whole new element of chi just felt off. They are trying so hard to pander to the modern standards of political correctness. THIS ISN'T ABOUT MODERN TIMES. Disney's huge stretch to not cause offense in any way shape or form IS ITSELF the offense. I felt myself having to look away from the screen shaking my head multiple times. I seriously felt I was watching a lower budgeted bollywood film. Where things just feel out of place and choreography was exaggerated. Out of all the remakes they have done for these disney cartoons. THIS was the worst. I understand not being able to keep all elements of the original movies. But at least on the other remakes they tried to stick with the theme and original movie",Mulan

The movie is so good and beautiful, I absolutely love the spectacular battle scenes of Mulan. I also liked the scenes where Mulan was with her family, the scene with her father was extremely emotional.The way the film honors the women is also amazing. There is no need to lift somebody by drowning someone. When you have the talent and dare to show it off, you deserve to be at the top no matter who you are.I also liked the movie because there weren't too many gore scenes. Young children need not watch too violent and bloody things. So this movie is perfect for families, for children.The film is coherent in content, easy to understand for children, many elements of family bonding, and has many good messages. the most valuable movie this year!",Mulan
2027,cleachin-68826,Very disappointed,2,5 September 2020,"I had really high hope bcuz I thought it's going to be much closer to REAL Mulan story which is not the carton one got mushu, all unrealistic things etc. As a Chinese, thats what I actually wanna watch. The trailer shows that it's much more realistic and more authentic to real Mulan story. However after I finished watching it...I'm very disappointed...not real, fine, and the phoenix is so fake, the first thing it reminded me is a kite, so 2d paper-like. Not to mention, villain turned to good side is so reluctant, no character development, so little. And the one more important thing is, want ""real"" approach then be ""real"", want ""magical"" approach then be ""magical"", don't mix both unless you know how to mix well and blend well. I'm so disappointed that I have to create an account here to comment. Acters in movie is average good, script is terrible, very terrible.
Overall it's pretty soulless and seem really weird.",Mulan

I'm just bumped that I don't get to see mushu, mulan's grandma AND SHANG :( They're the ones who made the movie alive and fun.And I get why they split shang's character to two different characters here.
But the interaction between mulan and honghui was too short. It would be nice to see that iconic ending scene in the original movie where mulan asked shang to stay for dinner and her grandma in the background shouted ""Can you stay forever?""I wish the ending was different in the remake.

Good job to all the actors and actresses!",Mulan

The art in focusing on the realistic view of the story was inspiring. The scenery, action sequence, and martial arts was amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that Mulan wasn't westernized in the way people had wanted to was very empowering because too often foreign stories are westernized and molded to fit the western agenda. The cast and acting was superb. The theme of bringing ""HONOR"" is very important to asian culture so it's refreshing to feel understood thus the constant reminder throughout the film was important. Mulan was the FIRST story to show how a WOMAN fought to be seen and treated as an equal by defying traditions, ignoring public opinions, and being honest to herself by being herself openly. This film was very empowering!!",Mulan

This is all wrapped in in a good way in the movie. I liked it and it is definately a movie worth watching.Yes, some scenes could be longer and have more depth, also story wise, but there is more to this movie that meets the eye.Its a 7 or 8 out of 10 movie, but ill give it 10 here, to counter all the bad reviews.Also, the ending, how i see it, is made like this so the movie might get a sequeal.Enjoy!",Mulan

I like how it didn't copy most of the cartoon in the movie.

This movie completely changes what the original movie was about it removes characters changes there origins it takes a horrible direction going ""woke"" by making Mulan and insane perfectly coordinated fighter which makes you feel completely disconnected from her she's immediately supposed to be ""badass"" but in the original you see her growth with her training becoming stronger and strengthening relationships this gave you a relationship with the character an understanding but that's too much effort for any of the cast director or writers could give so they just took the easy way out and pivotal characters like mushu and the cricket have been completely removed and it changes the movie's direction drastically and not for the better. In my honest opinion this was such a blatant cash grab playing on your nostalgia please for the sake of your childhood please do not watch this movie it is a waste of money and time you would honestly have a better time watching Cats than this.",Mulan
2054,wildevall,Worst ridiculous movie ever,1,6 September 2020,"Terrible acting, ridiculous stunts throughout the movie. In the final fight scene, how can Jason Scott Lee's character not die after falling many stories, then he had perfect aim with the bow and shot the arrow right at the emperor many stories above while laying on the ground assuming hurt from the fall, then the emperor caught the arrow mid air like it was nothing, then Mulan somehow jumped in the air and kicked the arrow right back at Jason Scott Lee perfectly and killed him.

2057,ianlmeyer,Expected better.,6,6 September 2020,"I want to start by saying I am someone who's seen the original a couple of times over the years maybe once as a kid and then in the last few years in the background as my kid watched it, but I don't really remember many details other than a lot of singing and that there was a little red dragon played by Eddie Murphy.My wife is Asian, she loves the movie it's her favorite Disney movie. She's a bit irate over this new one and is deeply disappointed there's none of the original songs and that they changed most of the story...All I can say is with all the hype for this movie for all of these months, I don't expected it to be better than this. The story didn't move me, it didn't feel powerful, I wasn't left thinking how I can't wait to see it again. I remember when I watched Moana with my kid who was 7 at the time, I was in the middle of the movie thinking ""wow, this is that Disney magic they did it again"". I get Aladdin wasn't exact to the old one but I thought the same thing with that. The same thing with the new Beauty and the Beast. The same thing with the new Lion King.It's a shame because here you have this all Asian cast, which I know how important it is to the Asian community, but then Disney drops the ball. The love story was weak, almost non-existent. The lesson in the story was, well, what is the lesson to the story? I just feel like I didn't really get much out of it. And it does seem weird that they took a Disney movie that had music and then took away all of its music.I thought maybe they were doing that because the story was going to be so epic and they were going to be edgy and that this would sort of make up for it, making the softness from a bunch of Disney songs ruin it but the story wasn't epic, it wasn't edgy. It was weak sauce the whole way through to the ends. I hate to even say it.I think everyone can agree it looks like a big budget movie, it's Disney. But there was no raw emotion, the acting all around was meh. I guess after aaaalllll this waiting and having to pay 30 fricken dollars that I was hoping for a movie that left me saying ""wow, that Disney magic again"".",Mulan

Perhaps the special effects weren't up to Disney's par, or maybe the dialogue did seem out of place at times, but the story held 'true'. Mulan's strength of character is not what's in-between her legs (as most movies would have you believe) but rather her heart. That's what makes a great hero. Who they are on the inside. With all that said, they did a great job portraying that. Could they done a bit better writing more fluid dialogue? Yes. Was the effects mind blowing, in my opinion no. But the character development and story more than made up for it. Best Disney remake yet.",Mulan

It captures the heart and essence of the original while providing so much more in terms of the legend of the loyal, brave and true hero that is Mulan. Beautifully done, rich with color and sweeping shots of stunning landscapes. If you go into it expected a faithfully reenactment of the original, you will miss out on the original take that this movie provides that is so much more. It feels more like an epic Kung Fu reimagining on par with Crouching Tiger with all the high flying fast moving action you would expect.

2065,securehope,Am ambitious project that was horribly exercuted.,3,6 September 2020,"I watch the original Mulan animated movie years ago, knowing they made huge changes beforehand, I dive into this movie with a mindset that this is nothing like the original, that I should enjoy it like a standalone Mulan movie. Still, it was bad to meh. I will avoid spoilers so many of my points will be vague.A movie empowering women and telling them to let go of the ""shackle"" that holds them back, to be themselves and they will discover the power that lies within, but they execute this concept horribly.
The huge issue is they build her up at a Mary Sue character, not her characteristic that made her a Mary Sue, it how she achieves everything, even with the settings of the story, you can still feel that she achieve everything so easily, and it not because she try, that have to throw in some ""special element"" that makes her unique. Talk about taking ""the power that lies within"" literally. Even then, they seem to forget about that special mojo after 1/3 of the plot.The pacing is also the issue, almost 2 hours long, but it feels rush, especially some scenes that can be used to flesh out the character and added more depth to her, but it feels rushed somehow. Even though I try to not compare this version with the animated one, the fact that a lot of scenes are the same, I have to say that the animated was better at establishing Mulan as Mulan, not just some generic she a special main woman character with no depth to her personality. They also try to cram in more original character, but what the points when you can't even have enough screen time for your mains.The characters/ actors were also an issue for me. First is Liu Yifei, I liked her and has high hope for the actor, well, for the first 2/3 of the movie, she was okay, but in the last portion, she expresses little to no emotions, and the last portions are the most dramatic ones, too, such a shame. Li Gong as Xianniang, an original antagonist that serves as a mirror to the character of Mulan, also did not leave any impression either, not only the character doesn't express many emotions, the way they write and cram her character arc was just... sad, very bad writing. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined, that all I can say. Other supporting characters were meh AT MOST.The special effects, musics, actions were average. For Disney, this saying something. It feels expensive, and cheap, at the same time. There was no memorable scene. The whole film was not even a visual feast in my opinion.One dimensional character, mediocre, if not, bad acting, average special effects, scores,... has made the 2020 Mulan a huge disappointment for me, if the audience is kids, I think they will wholely like it, but for adults, especially people that grow up watching the original Mulan, prepare to be disappointed, one way or another.
Rant: Yeah, this is a small segment for me, cause I really, really want to rant about one ""special"" character in the movie, and personally, that character killed the whole experience for me. It Cricket, I seriously hate how he is written, how an insignificant character that can agitated me so, so much. What is the purpose of this character, a comic relief, you every weak, cowardly guys but in the end learn to be strong types?? Poorly written, serve no purpose to the plot. I don't hate the actor, I hate the characters. You literally can cut this character out and it will make no different to the plot and the movie.",Mulan
2066,jason-public,"Fun, beautiful, uplifting",9,6 September 2020,"If you're expecting a live action remake of the cartoon then don't watch this.If you're looking for a fun movie, with an uplifting message without any put downs, and stunning visuals that portrays the beauties of another culture then this is for you.It's wonderful to see a lead female hero who has morals, values, and puts family first. She's brave and strong - saves a country!!! - and gives little girls everywhere a role model.Luckily this sends a strong female empowerment message that doesn't tear down men, but shows how men and women can be stronger together.There is a little bit of fighting that's over the top, but have you seen the Avengers?It is PG-13 but it probably could have been PG.

2070,meagansm,An updated ballad to strong women,9,6 September 2020,"Honestly, I really enjoyed this version! If you go into this movie expecting a sing-a-long style remake of the original, you'll absolutely be disappointed. They cut characters that were intended for comic relief. They cut the love story. They made Mulan closer to the character from the ballad, and frankly, she was incredible! Yes, it lacks the humor of the original, but you truly see how strong Mulan is. The acting was fine. It had a few throw back moments, that offered some insight into where you were plot wise. It is a more mature version of the story! The reason I didn't give it 10 stars is because I would've loved to see more of Xianniang. Also, I would not recommend it for the younger crowd, not because of violence, but because it lacks the elements to keep them interested.",Mulan
2071,Khayelts,Glass half full.,6,6 September 2020,"From the start until the credits, I watched this movie with hope.
The production work feels amazing throughout the movie, the scenery, the midst that revolved constantly around the main character.
The work done around Xian's performance is cinematographicaly great, there's absolutely no lacking there.
This is the type of movie that someone that preys on character development would enjoy to a certain extent, as the drama that revolves around our heroine is noticeable and again, to a certain extent, well played.We follow a girl that had been helding back her true virtues, and to my disapointment, by the end of the movie I couldnt just let go of the thought that we had only seen around 5% of her true potencial.
With every step of her journey, it's possible to feel brief and faint character advancement, but when it truly matters storywise, it just felt too easy.About the fights. I honestly thought they were enjoyable as a whole but as we get little notion of a timeframe, some elements seem to be too scattered and as the movie goes on combat feels weaker and weaker. I couldn't help but to wonder ""Did a small batallion of newbies just hold of a regiment of shadow warriors sent to assassinate the emperor?"", ""How much time did they really spent training? Weeks? Months?"".And I truly hope, with all my being, that there's a version of this movie in native tongue. English in this setting felt a bit awkward and forced in some lines.In conclusion, as entertainment this movie as a whole felt good, the plotline and scenery is light and pleasing to the eye, I can say I enjoyed this 2 hours.
Objectively, I'd have enjoyed it more if the last quarter of the movie wasn't so rushed, the fights could've been more epic and other characters could've had more light shine on to them so the plot could feel more natural.",Mulan

Considering the way Disney has been making live actions of their movies with some successful ones ie;Jungle book with others not as successful ""Lion King"". It's safe to say that this has fallen in the mid tier range. With an amazing cast no doubt about that, an amazing cinematography which is a pity because it isn't being shown on the big screen. ""There have been many tales of the great warrior Mulan. But ancestors, this one is mine"".. these were the opening words of the movie and I find it smart that they added a narrator in this movie telling us ""his ""version Mulan . It lacked a lot of things that the original animation had such as Mushu etc... But with those different aspects absent it paved a way for the character Mulan to be fully exploited. Carrying the same tenacity and bravery as we know how Mulan should be. It was honestly a very interesting take of the movie which was not disappointing but for many Mulan fans it could possibly be a let down. But it will definitely be an enjoyable movie for the new Mulan fans. Will it have a lot of ratings?

It is bad, bad, bad. As an Asian myself I was having high hopes and eagerly waited to watch Mulan. I remember seeing the beautiful trailer and tell myself I will watch Mulan as soon as it is released. This movie however has no soul. The character development is so bad it feels like every character is one dimension. I didn't even know Jet Li is the emperor - I seriously thought the emperor is some low key chinese actor. There is no scene that left an impact. Mulan is an inspiring character but the movie directing has made her into some sort of super hero - who she is not.

It lacked emotions and there was barely any relationship development. The emotional connection between characters in the animated version was far more intense. Even considering that it was a serious movie based on the original story, it could have had some lighter moments. People are just aware of Mulan, the cartoon. They had expectations, given that the animated version was loved by all. I honestly, missed mushu, and general and Mulan's love angle; but that could be just me.

Such as the ugly Chinese fonts that look like they copied from Microsoft Word, bad quality props and costumes they bought from Amazon, couplets (the Duilian sticked on the wall of matchmake's house) make absolutely no sense and are written in simplified Chinese characters lol...It's 2020 now but this movie is still full of stereotypes of China from the last century, showing no respect for the culture or people who love the story of Mulan.

Well the story tells of a brave girl from a small village, but using Mulan's name and then missing Mulan animation supplements is not good for me.
Even Jason Scott Lee acting as Bori Khan did not bring realism due to the physical body appearance, better Ron Yuan would have acted as Bori Khan. Even the fighting and the ending of Bori Khan was too easy.

2090,maryorivo,Disappointing,4,6 September 2020,"Very sad to say this but I was honestly let down by this movie, maybe it was just because of having high expectations created by the animation but it did not live up to it.I really missed the songs and they left out so many characters whilst introducing new ones which didn't really have as much depth to contribute to the story.
Whilst watching it I was also thinking about the budget of the movie, which is something I have never done before haha. But it just felt that they were constrained and that's why they weren't able to really highlight some of those big scenes from the animation.
However, I did kind of look at Mulan in a different way- they really showed her struggle with not only leaving family, but also her guilt deceiving her comrades.
They also completely took out the romance- which ok, they're at war- but that was also a big part of her gaining the trust and respect of her platoon in my opinion - Li Shang was their captain after all. Dunno though, maybe they didn't want to portray a woman getting with her boss 🤷‍♀️
They also introduced this magical element through something they called chi (her inner strength essentially). I loved this one scene where her father is telling her to suppress her strength in order to become a good wife and mother for the future. But otherwise, this kind of just didn't develop that much from there.In general though, as a lot of reviews have already stated, I really felt that the movie relied on the nostalgia as well as the viewers prior knowledge of the animated version of this movie and can therefore not really stand on its own successfully.All in all, it felt like a weak attempt at making it resonate:
they should have expanded upon the traditional chinese culture more (This version has a sister - let her get married to some renowned guy so the pressure really is on mulan to get married - but I do not know why they I created a sister to begin with though),really show the general struggle within the war (in the animation Li's father dies leading another platoon against their enemies- really shows the effect of war - which this one kind of did as it showed the aftermath but with a distance as we did not know anyone who died from that scene)and maybe also a scene or repeated references to how men look at the way their society is constructed / their views on the opposite gender (as this IS a story about the differences between men and women).Nonetheless, I still love the girl power In this movie adaptation. The introduction of the witch really sets the undertone of how women who have strengths, are perceived to as something evil because women aren't supposed to step outside the kitchen door.Maybe I will rewatch but the animation is still #1 to me",Mulan

Really, I don't care about the absence of Mushu or Shang. I think it's a good idea to follow the original story. I like the concept. BUT, I don't think it was well executed. I really expected Mulan to be an action movie and weighs on the fight scenes but it was so shallow. I still expected some musical, I mean they could add it. They could've made the training scene have more depth and sweat. Make it harsher and repeated because it makes more sense, it's the emperor army anyway. Could've made it musical in that part too. The battle scene is so shallow too.. I just think it could've been a lot better. I'm disappointed tbh, not because it's not as fun as 1998 Mulan, but because it was just shallow.

It takes a Disney classic and mixes in some Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon style action. The lead is intense and loveable. The cinemagrophy is gorgeous. I love the liberties they took to differ from the original, which made the story better. And, my daughter gets to look up to a courageous, independent warrior instead of a damsel in distress that is so typical of Disney. To those complaining that the movie was too ""fantasy martial art action flick"" like, they let you know that in the trailers. To those who are disappointed it isn't exactly like the original, I say ""good! That would not have been a good movie anyways"". To those that complain about the lead just ""annoying"", I say ""so are half the male leads you praise..."".

I also disliked the lack of romance, but I could have done without the love interest if only there was some other element to make up for it. The ending was lacking with Mulan losing the sword!! One of my favorite parts in the original was when she bowed down and presented the sword and medal to her father. In my opinion it is not as kid friendly as the original and should have had some comedic moments to break up the serious action scenes. Also not a fan that the hawk was brought to life into a sorceress.

Now that I've grown I realize that where so many other characters to focus on that I forgot this movie was about Mulan. The woman who became a worrier, the worrier who became a leader, the leader who became a legend is seen in this movie. We see the woman behind the legend.

2109,nodnarb-07181,Deserving of far more credit than it has received,9,6 September 2020,"This is not the Disney cartoon - it's more mature, and yet walks the fine line of retaining enough of the innocence from the first iteration that it is appropriate enough for children to watch while shedding itself of the light-heartedness that made it childish. The plot remains nearly identical, with some slight shifts that better accommodate live-action. While some critics malign the special effects of the film, they neglect the historical nods to Chinese fantastical martial arts films, like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, the Ip Man series, Fearless, and countless others. The effects are intended to separate the film from reality, as a war movie based in realism is completely inappropriate for children. Despite the overly PC PG-13 rating for violence and coming of age themes, the film almost never shows any blood, and Mulan coming of age is gently insinuated rather than uncomfortably forced down your throat. Compared to other Disney re-make efforts, it is less frightening than the Lion King by a long shot and on par with Aladdin in execution (minus the cheese-y music). It does an excellent job of reinventing aspects of the Legend of Mulan, while at the same time remaining true. Not the same as the original cartoon...better in all the right ways.",Mulan

Let's not talk about the weird arcitectural style, wrongly cited makeup and costumes which made my sisiter who studied in Asian Studies laughed. The core value of the original story is gone. In the original story, Mulan is just a ordinary girl like everybody else who sews. No stupid Chi or chasing chicken on the rooftop. However, Mulan's grassroot characteristics are actually what make the story shine. It tells us that no matter which gender you identified with or what you are capable of, you get to do whatever you want if you make your mind to it. I didn't see any of it in the movie becasue they decided that ""okay girls can't defeat armies let give them superpowers so it can make sense"". What the hell Disney?????",Mulan
2112,arubafatima,Mulan 2020 deserves better rating,10,6 September 2020,"I had to make an account for this. Mulan 2020 DOES NOT deserve a 5.6 rating. of course it's not a screen by screen remake like the lion king 2019 was. i can understand why people would want that but you have to chill guys.
the action is great, the characters are beautiful and all the actors fit so well. olden china wasn't this colourful but what's a Disney movie without colour. the sets are amazing. the cinematography is beautiful. the acting is laudable- liu yifei did an amazing job.
The khan's character missed some depth. If they could add the witch they could add Mushu. though i love this version- i don't love it more than mushu. there could've be an addition of wit and humor but i am not complaining.

This story line is so good. I really recommend going into this movie with an open mind.,Mulan
2119,LockeWan,Nice adaptation but lackluster,6,7 September 2020,"I was surprised to see the new role of witch whose appearance reflected that the minorities was not being accepted by the mainstream value, just like mulan was told to hide her chi. She also promoted mulan to find the true, take off the armor, show the long flowing hair and the beauty of famale soilder. She enriched the image of mulan, but at the same time weakened mulan's unique character. I think the witch should remain villain at the end of the movie and mulan's change should come from her own heart.",Mulan
2120,bill-70632,Not a Remake but a Retelling of a Real Legend,10,7 September 2020,"The original animated Mulan was a mildly racist typical animated film with lots of non-Asian people voicing Asian characters. This movie is a sensitive retelling of the 5th century legend of female strength against male judgement and strict tradition. Asians say family name first, like Smith John. Family and and tradition are everything to Asians. There was almost nothing Asian about the first two movies, and that's why many people don't get this movie. I've seen it twice and got emotional each time. Perhaps it's because I'm half Asian. I get both cultures and enjoy the differences.Most negative reviews I have read here lament that this is too Asian. They want a live musical version of the cartoon. This has nothing to do with the cartoon. It's a unique movie that delivers on both drama and action. There is subtlety in the performances and power in the action. There is no way this is a 1 star movie. I just don't think audiences are not comfortable seeing an all Asian cast that is not full of stereotypes.There is also criticism of the witch character. I found her to be one of the most compelling characters. She is a metaphor for all women that have been rejected for being strong. Her story is one of breaking rules, showing strength and finally of redemption.This is an important film on multiple levels, and I may watch it a third time which is something I never do.",Mulan

2123,emilywchapman,A Beautiful Movie with an empowering message,10,7 September 2020,"This movie deserves much a much higher score than it is getting. Yes, it is different than the original but that is the point. Visually stunning with great acting. They stayed true to Chinese culture and did not try to overly Americanize it (for an American movie). I did miss the songs but the songs don't come across the same in live action If you ask me.I love that the movie wasn't so much about the love story. It's 2020, It's important to show little girls and young woman that their worth is so much more than just ""getting the guy"" in the end. I'm so happy they did not have her entire journey boil down to getting married. Finally society is progressing past this.This movie was amazing and people need to stop being such haters. This movie should evolve past the 1998 animation and I think Disney did that wonderfully.",Mulan
2124,asheashleyfowler,Why the witch?!?!?!,6,7 September 2020,"The witch added an unrealistic element to the story. It really distanced me from the fear of the hun evasion. I actually drew tears in the original when Mulan and her friends found the burnt village with the general's helmet and the girl's doll.
I actually enjoyed the concept of Chi, being a star wars fan. BUT using Chi to turn into animals and having claws for hands was just too ridiculous. And why is it that only the witch could transform? And no one else? There were male warriors that used chi too. Are female Chi users inherently stronger? What about male and female equality?
Also, that pheonix CGI looked like they added it last minute. Worst CGI in the whole movie.
I wish mulan had more dialog.",Mulan
2125,rushyantorosemarie,Fully rely on the visual,6,7 September 2020,"Storywise, it's flat and forced. Every time the characters accomplished the conflicts, the Phoenix shows up and 'whisper' to Mulan to tell her what she should be doing next, it feels like Mulan as the main character has no solid purpose for herself other than to protect her father and family. The story feels forced as there's not enough strong motives to drive the characters fight for something other than to save the Emperor at the end. Side characters have no big role to Mulan nor to drive the story or to put the stake higher, they're simply thrown in as emotional support to Mulan (she's still bland though) and as clown character (which miserably failed too, sorry Cricket), almost feel like the bonding between them is awkwardly forced, they're just stuck with each other and has to work together as a team under the reason of same purpose, plus they're the only remaining armies. Lack of characters development is the second big hole. Mulan's father is too good (too wise and too perfect) to be true as the Chinese is pretty patriarchal, it feels like he has no flaws other than his leg injury from previous war. Mulan herself as main character is stoic and reactive to the situation, not entirely sure she knows what she's doing, she just reacts on spot. Other than those points, the visual, set designs, and choreography is pretty neat and well-executed, as an overall remake, it's dull.",Mulan

They max lots of Japan.Korea and other I don't know what's that things.
Mulan is a story about ""BE WHO YOU ARE""! Not to tell people to respect parents and do whatever they said,ok?

But the actors' acting, screenwriting, and cinematography fell really flat. Mulan never showed any emotion, she just looks like a show-off soldier with a gift of chi. The scenes progression felt rushed and the transitions were not smooth. It's ridiculous when Mulan went back to the camp after being expelled, the Commander went from almost killing her to make her the leader of the batallion. Mind is blown.There were only 2 jokes in the whole movie and both were lame. Even the way they laughed were unconvincing.

In the animate Mulan, lighter tones, more humor, yet it's too kiddish to show Mulan's real strength with the male character's muscular body slightly dominating the power of Mulan, making her more or less dependent on the male characters. On the other hand, this one distinguishes itself from the traditional approach, Mulan is independent and is a leader.I like the fierce determination and confidence (her eyes show).

2138,ejoysmiley,Beautiful movie!,9,7 September 2020,"The new Mulan is a beautiful movie! Of course, some things are different from the animated version, but some of these changes are nice to see. For example, while the animated movie moves very quickly through Mulan's decision to go to the army and her training, the new movie lets us experience her physical and emotional journey much more thoroughly. We get to see Mulan having to live with the men in the army and her fear of being found out. Mulan's decision to disguise herself as a man to save her father is one of the most important aspects of the movie. The new version gives us a much better picture of what that must have been like for Mulan (in the animated version, she lives in a mini tent by herself and doesn't seem to struggle too much with being a man and risking her life). Also, we liked that Mulan had been training as a warrior most of her life, while in the animated version she becomes a war hero in a very short amount of time. Also, while Mulan was brave and smart and learned some skills in the animated version, she wasn't really a skillful warrior. For the new Mulan, being a warrior was what she was born to do and we loved seeing her in the fight scenes.You could argue that the use of chi and the witch's role were not really necessary and took away from the film, but since they decided to go with those elements, they did a good job in how they incorporated them.We loved how the new movie included the avalanche like in the animated movie, but we wished the other soldiers would have realized that Mulan had saved their lives. In the animated movie we have two important moments that come from this situation: Mulan saves her team (including Shang) and she comes face to face with the villain before the avalanche starts. Unfortunately, we didn't get either of these in the new movie.Overall, this is an epic movie that gives us a more vivid and real picture of the story of Mulan. While we think some of the storyline could be improved, it is a great movie and very enjoyable.",Mulan

They also portray women of China as if they are submissive, in the part where her father tells Mulan she cannot be herself and to act more like a lady. The film is very boring and everything happens slowly, not much action. The reason I watched it all is because I was waiting for an awe moment that never happened. I am truly disappointed, especially because Disney is all about music and laughter. I clearly did not see this for being one of my favorite Disney movies. I cannot get over mushu not being in the film.",Mulan
2154,black-knight-87414,Too much for kids. Too little for adults.,2,8 September 2020,"Disney films are often targeted towards kids, but Mulan is a story that has been known for many years now and I understand why Disney felt the need to also stylise this movie in such a way that it would be enjoyable for adults who grew up with this story as well. However, I feel that Disney has completely failed by not adding enough in multiple areas to critique.The plot 1/10:
I went into this movie blind and didn't know about whether Disney chose to change the plot or not. Jumping right in however, it was clear immediately the plot would be drastically changed. Mulan is shown to have powerful skills already rather than training to become powerful. I kept myself open to this idea, however, in retrospect I see this choice of change as a cop out from Disney in terms of creating any real plot progression or character development in this film. Characters aren't developed well... names of characters are not even memorable. Supporting characters felt as if they were used only to bring about nostalgia. For example, Yoson An's role as a newly introduced character, a rival recruit to the character of Mulan, appears in the lake which Mulan washes herself. However, this scene doesn't feel deserved with the fast progression of the plot and simply felt inserted in to create nostalgia for adult viewers.Just as a side thought... Some people may also bring up the point of the phoenix in this film. I believe there is symbolism of rebirth for Mulan with the use of a phoenix instead of Mushu, but would kids be able to make this link themselves?Action 3/10:
Big name action stars Donnie Yen and Jet Li bring about a lot of promise for the action scenes in this movie. Donnie Yen suits his role as the training commander well displaying his skills beautifully. However, Jet Li being the emperor displaying skills felt out of place. Overall, the direction of action scenes in this movie felt promising at first where scenes such as running up walls felt homage towards traditional Chinese action film. However, I was thoroughly disappointed with the choice of no blood or visible injuries. This is probably a choice to keep this film suitable for children but I feel this takes away the intensity of the action. In conclusion, my opinion on the action in this film is that although there is good choreography, I am disappointed with the visual effect choices Disney has gone with. Simply not enjoyable as an adult viewer. However, what really makes my rating of the action not even have a pass mark of a 5/10 is that some scenes just feel extremely illogical. Why did the witch need to throw herself in front of the arrow for Mulan? Why did Mulan have to close the doors behind her as she headed towards the emperor? Why does the enemy commander jump on top of the beam, balancing out the beam and allowing Mulan to climb back up?Sountrack 0/10:
Don't expect any singing. My opinion is that characters bursting out in song is unique and core to the image of Disney films. I'm sure both kids and adults would have appreciated any inclusion of music. I don't know if this was a choice made due to political correctness due to the nature of some of the original Mulan movie's songs.This is my first review thanks for reading if you did.",Mulan
2155,videojr,Potential materialize as cringe,3,8 September 2020,"I came to this film with no expectations but I was disappointed nonthless.
While I thought this movie will be good based on the first scenes with mulan (until she fights the rourans), the premise with the rourans and the super natural didn't do it for me.
Some of the action was cool and good but for the most it was over the top and unbelievable (for me).
The family dynamics, and the 'girl-pretends-to-be-soldier' was what I enjoyed. But unfortunately a big chunk of the film revolves around the rourans etc... which I didn't like.

The makeup, costumes, the word Qi, the poorly made phoenix CGI made me feel like the director put together a hodgepodge of all the Chinese symbols that the western world has ever heard about and forced them into a movie.

But nope, it was an all around mess. First of all, it's Woke (of course it is), but that's only the start of the problems. Sometimes they have lame fighting styles, other times they just randomly throw in something out of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and not in a good way, but it's all really boring. They also took out all the interesting characters, like Mushu, Shang, Cricket, Mulan's grandmother, Mulan's 3 army friends, and instead we get these pointless nobodies who have little to no role other than simply being there. They even gave Mulan a sister, but she adds absolutely nothing; you can take her out of the movie and it changes nothing. Oh, and there's no Shan Yu either, instead we get these two generic, boring villains with no character. And let's not forget the inclusion of chi and actual magic and witchcraft. And, of course, Mulan is an overpowered Mary Su who, even as a child, was performing moves that would put Jacki Chan to shame. I mean, why not give her actual development in training and stuff to show her becoming a good fighter when you can just make her super OP Mary Sue right off the bat, right? The acting itself is bland, and even the dialogue is horrible. Everyone talks in these tone-deaf monotone voices with no emotion in them. You really feel nothing for any these characters. The movie has none of the charm of the original, and they don't even have any of the songs. Seriously, the movie is an utter disaster, and completely boring. They would have been better off doing a shot-for-shot remake like they did with the live-action Lion King. Get your act together, Disney, you're sinking your own ship.""",Mulan

All things Disney were removed so we could be presented with a generic movie such as we have all seen before. My expectations was to see the original movie with real people, perhaps with some minor modifications. What I got was an entirely different story. Thus comparing to its original animated version, the movie would barely get a 1/10 at best.That said, if you come with no expectations and don't compare it to the original, you may be able to rate it a 7/10. It could go higher but they have some issues with character development and there are just too many things that felt forced.I'll hope that in the future we'll be able to see a live action version that includes a little Disney magic.

While I greatly enjoyed the cartoon movie, I thought this movie was beautiful to watch and entertaining. I do think that a household with just 1 person might not think it's worth paying the $30 on Disney Plus. I have a family of 5 and so it was worth it. But, the $30 price tag will be high for small families. But, I did like it. I wish there had been more character development where you actually see Mulan learn her skills because she is portrayed as a young girl as a do-it-all girl with special abilities. I think it would have been nicer to see a normal girl with courage who teachers herself the skills needed to be a warrior. But overall, I liked the movie.",Mulan
2193,bjpebbles,Soulless Characterization and Baffling Execution,3,16 August 2021,"I appreciate the attempts that were made to make this movie stand out from the shadow of its predecessor, but to be honest, it would have been better off sticking to the original storyline. As a Chinese person, I am honestly confounded on how they showed that they did their research but decided to conveniently ignore it.In the movie, there is the line mentioning the two rabbits running side by side. This is an extremely obvious reference to the original Ballad of Mulan. To anyone familiar with the original original, they didn't even try to integrate this reference into the material and it seems awkwardly inserted into the dialogue. Also, the writing in the movie is clearly in simplified Chinese script, which was not in use until the 20th century. As a Disney movie, though, one can let that slide.Another major problem is technical. Somehow, none of the characters seem to understand how a battle unfolds. On the battlefield, it isn't about how many backflips you can do in a row, but more about the organization and deployment of troops, the communication between legions, and the strategies used. During the battle scene, a small portion of the Rouran army tries to escape, and somehow the general decides to chase them down while the entrie battle is happening behind. Not only this, Mulan is in a position to attack the opponent from behind, but instead chooses to waste time engaging with the witch. When she returns, somehow everyone has broken formation, a deadly mistake as the light cavalry would have had no chance against the heavily armed Chinese infantry if they had just stayed together. For some reason, Mulan removes her armor, and doesn't even take a shield, a move that looks impressive but really is complete suicide. For some reason, the Rourans use a trebuchet on mobile troops (they can move like 10 meters to the left and you would miss), and no one moves an inch, even after the first group is comepletely decimated. Nothing unfolds the way things unfold in life, and some decisons are entirely nonsensical and would get you killed.Now we shall move on the the charactizations and plot. I understand why Mushu was removed, but why Li Shang? He was a brilliant character. And why was the witch added? She doesn't fit into the setting, nor the storyline. One thing admirable about the story of Mulan was that she started out as a normal human being, just like the rest of us, and rose up through the ranks using her intellect, something nobody in this version has. There was no need to give her a special power to elevate her above everyone else. The largest issue is that this movie seems more concerned with the representation of things instead of what actually happens. Instead of showing Mulan's emotional arc, we are repeatedly told ""She is a warrior"" ""Loyal, brave and true"". This makes it difficult to connect to her as a character because it feels as if the audience is being slammed in the face with a sledgehammer of informed character values every few minutes. Her original essence was not ""I am a warrior,"" but instead her sacrifice for her family and her country, and that she did not require any title given to her by the emperor. In this version, it seems like the script supports her ego more than her selfless spirit and accomplishments, and the plot is willing to put many in extreme peril in order to fulfill the goal of making her appear dramatic and capable. More things are told than they are shown, and if they are shown, they are not shown in a way that is believable (see above analysis of nonsensical battle plan). It feels like none of the characters seem human: they don't have loves and hates, fears and desires, Mulan doesn't even have that many expressions. Everybody just seems like a fill in for a role required for the script, and not a vibrant character people can relate to. It feels like it's trying too hard to fufill a deep message, which only results in an empty, preaching piece.In conclusion, things don't even have to be entirely accurate; they just have to be well executed enough as to not let the viewer give their attention to all the mistakes. There are so many things that just don't make sense in this version, and I believe they lost the spirit of Mulan. Mulan is a courageous young woman who goes to war for her father, succeeds as a result of her effort and intellect, has no need for a title or glory, and returns to her family. She finds herself in the process of fighting for something greater. This Mulan is characterized in a way that follows the cliche ""don't fit in, stand out"" formula that has been used on just about every single high school movie ever. Perhaps this protagonist would have made for an adequate story, but she is not Mulan.",Mulan

The only feminist thing is that Mulan is fighting as a woman, and by that you can see the screenwriter's gall. if this was based on a western story i guess this movie can be criticized to the point where the director team takes the lead to apologize. honestly i doubt whether the crew has read 'the ballad of mulan' cuz even if they only read the first line they wouldn't come out with such a stupid setting of 'chi'. when i saw mulan could only use chi when she admits that she's a woman... i was like what the hell?!?!?

2200,potatosuop,Stop comparing this to the 1998 animated film,10,10 September 2020,"Mulan is great. The thing is, everyone keeps comparing this show to the animation. They're in completely different time-frames, targeted at different audiences. If Disney wanted a complete carbon copy of the 1998 animated Mulan, they wouldn't have spent $200 million on this film. Where's the creativity in that? The variation? Just watch it as a standalone, completely new film. Trust me, you'll enjoy it much more.There are a lot of tiny details I missed the first time I watched too. It kinda feels like they wanted to squeeze the film into 2 hours, cos they kinda rushed through the plot. It was kinda hard to catch up with the plot, but watching it the second time helped a lot. Also I couldn't really sympathize with Mulan before rewatching it. I don't know, but maybe COVID kinda affected their filming or something. Only Disney can answer that.Mulan could have done with more sacrifice on her part to add that emotional touch to the film. Her ""qi"" makes her, like, way too powerful.I would also liked to have seen more relationship between Honghui and Mulan. I mean, someone who you just talked to in the dormitories and during lunchtimes definitely isn't worth risking your life for. I could tell Disney wanted to add a little romance, but not too much. Mulan dropped only 2 hints about her liking Honghui, and it would be generous to call them subtle. If they wanted to steer their relationship towards friendship, they could have done so without those hints. For the sake of not spoiling the story, I won't mention those hints here.Visuals-wise, everything is flawless. Expected from a $200 million budget film. Nothing looks fake and plasticky, and the action choreography isn't too bad either. At least Mulan doesn't glide around like a paper aeroplane. I also liked how Mulan used different types of weaponry, ranging from bow to spear to fists. It brings more life to the story, instead of her using only a sword and doing impossible stuff with it.As for the acting, the dialogue could have been more emotional and dramatic. I really liked Honghui's acting, he was able to add that realistic touch to his dialogue without losing the emotion in it. Mulan's acting wasn't bad as well, the tears at the end of the movie when she reunites with her father didn't seemed forced. The witch's dialogue overall was calm and, to be honest, flat, though it probably fitted her role as a supposedly powerful villain.I have no idea why this film got such a low rating. It definitely deserves much higher than 5.5/10.",Mulan

Secondly, as Mulan she's come across as a strong warrior but you did not present those personality and you're kinda emotionless in the movies which is such a let down. Third, there no romance between you and the main actor. The original animated film romance definitely outbeat this one...last but not least, there's no song playing in the whole movie only at the end of the credit part which does not stir up emotions for those watching it.

And the music, might have been missed- yet I feel if they suddenly burst out in song may have felt odd in this world- do you just start bursting into song?

2227,annastasiagrace,"Aside from politically reviews from others.. after watching the movvie myself, i cansay it was beautifully made!",9,12 September 2020,"Personally, Mulan and Aladdin are the best live-action Disney so far. THE GIRL who plays Mulan is really talented. She knows martial arts/sword fighting, knows how to horseback riding, and she can sing! I was happily surprised that she sung Reflection in Mandarin version (it's on the ending credits) her voice is so beautifully soothing and soft. The mandarin version sung by her is really emotional to listen... you guys should check it out
Anyway, for the movie itself, it wasn't like the animated Mulan 1998. I know people disappointed because there was no Mushu, but in Mulan's story, it was originally based on a legendary warrior from 2000 BCE China and I think Disney's trying to make it more to a realistic movie. This version of Mulan is closer to the actual story than the cartoon animated. It's actually a good movie and deserves watching even though they made some changes like replacing Shang with Honghui and taking out Mushu and replaced it with Phoenix (and in Chinese folklore, the phoenix represents woman so that's a good match). Anyhow, I loved the story and this movie is a perfect fit for you if you are looking for a film that can blow your mind over the action, cinematography & martial arts.",Mulan

Mulan inspires people to be better and show that everything is possible as long as you work for it. However, this ""Mulan"" has no character development whatsoever, she starts stronger than the other characters and everything she accomplishes looks effortless.
You love Disney magic? Great! In here you have no gravity, witchcraft, Lord of the Rings Legola's double-arrow, packed with non plausible physics. Who needs bows when you can shoot arrows with your feet? Who needs ladders when you can just run up the walls?
I already knew that some characters wouldn't make it to the movie but making Mushu a Phoenix and turning Mulan's Grandmother into a sister, that added nothing to the storyline, did not change the movie for the better. The characters that remained were bland and boring, including Mulan herself.

2246,vonhayek,Mechanical and empty shell,2,17 September 2020,"I loved the 1998 Mulan, even as an adult. It was an inspiring story of bravery, defying conventions, transformation, hard work, and being true to yourself. It was also hilarious due to Mushu, the little dragon.The 2020 remake is just a dull and pointless movie. Even the fight scenes were more about defying the laws of physics than about actual fighting skills.1) Mulan has been turned into a superhero who was born with superhuman powers. This is problematic for many reasons: a) She never has to suffer and work hard to learn new skills -- these were just natural gifts to her. This eliminates much of the personal growth story of the original. Literally the only growth that Mulan experiences during the entire movie is that she decides to admit being a woman and not to hide her fighting skills anymore. b) The original movie was much more realistic and easier to digest. In the original, Mulan used her wits to defeat the enemy: launching an avalanche etc. This is the way a young girl actually could have a big impact in the war. But in the remake, she physically wields a sword and almost single-handedly cuts down an army of trained male soldiers. I'm not saying movies have to be totally realistic, but at some point it just becomes ridiculous.2) The fight scenes are all about flying, catching flying arrows with bare hands, kicking flying spears toward your enemies, etc., which totally defies the laws of physics. This is an unfortunate attempt to copy the traditional Chinese martial arts movies that are all about flying and abandoning any sense of realism. Note that this is tradition that Bruce Lee went against -- he wanted to make all fight scenes and moves realistic. As someone who is passionate about martial arts, I love the Bruce Lee approach but cringe at this supernatural approach.3) The ideology in the movie is in-your-face authoritarianism. Everything is about unquestioning obedience to the ruler -- it's all about loyalty, honor (defined by the ruler), and self-sacrifice. No one EVER asks what Mulan wants, nor does she express any desire of her own, except to serve her ruler and country and honor her family. Even the prospect of having found love (personal goal) is basically eliminated from the remake. One low point is when Mulan totally pointlessly offers herself up for execution, having broken the rule against women in the military (but not serving any sensible purpose, not even helping anyone else in any way) -- this is just a model of absolute obedience.Meanwhile, the ruler is shown as another supernatural martial arts expert who also deeply cares about the people of China. He is a wise and benevolent dictator -- basically a perfect human. There is absolutely no hint of corruption or personal vanity.4) In general, the movie was just not good at some many levels. The phoenix looked like a drone covered with a few ugly rags and it was very clumsily woven into the story. Pretty much all characters were robotic. Adding a shape-shifting almost all-powerful witch also was an unfortunate and unnecessary thing. And the witch's decisions at the end just came out of the blue and made no sense for her.The only good thing about the remake was that was really beautiful in terms of scenery, costumes, etc.Overall, I really wish I had not supported this movie by shelling out $30 for it. We really don't need more movies like this.",Mulan

2249,bodietheldsfreak,"Something different, and that's a good thing",7,14 September 2020,"Honestly a great movie on its own. While there are some things that don't make sense, such as the avalanche scene, it was overall an enjoyable movie. There where many parts that where changed form the original animated adaptation of the story, but a lot more culture as put in. I think it's easy to forget that the story is a Chinese tale first that was adapted by Disney into an animated format, and they harken back to that culture pretty well. Even down to the action scenes, that personally remind me of old Jackie Chan films and the writing which seem to pay homage to many Asian dramas. It is a bit different, and there are some changes that I'd make, but overall the movie was enjoyable and had a great message about honesty and just being confident in yourself without really focusing to much on a specific demographic, making it relate to a wider audience. The way they handled things such as her life in the camp and her desire to do the right thing despite what it could mean for her life was handled quite well in my opinion. Everything from how Mulan would have to wake up earlier and go to bed later to deal with her bindings, to her feelings of guilt for hiding her true identity. I believe that it was well casted as well. Sure we lost some fun side kicks and the main love interest was changed but what they have worked, at least for me. It was believable that these where real people, in a real war. (Cricket being one of the best characters.) However, the movie still has its flaws. Personally Xian Long (The Witch) turned to Mulan's side a little to easily, and I don't understand why she wasn't the main villain. I would have liked the poll scene to have been replaced with something more about wit than strength. I fill that the whole point of the poll challenge was to teach how to turn a disadvantage in to an advantage. Using your head to tern something restrictive into an asset. In this version it was replaced with climbing a mountain with buckets of water. I suppose it could have been a mind over mater thing, however it came off as more of a ""I just got stronger, I guess,"" kind of vibe, rather than being a problem that you had to out think. Overall a good film. I still prefer the animated classic, however, on its own, this film held up. (Also it was nice to see Ming-Na Wen getting a cameo)",Mulan
2250,jpreviews,If this film was titled anything but Mulan it would've been great,2,14 September 2020,"How can people criticize the comparison for a movie made in resemblance to the animated film? It's suppose to be a live remake, well obviously there will be comparison and a certain standard to meet.I came to watch this film with an open mind but:
It starts off okay, but bearing question to Mulan's skills with no training, that parkour, really?The village is a closed off circle all living cramped up? Doesn't make sense to me when I see pictures of Chinese villages with beautiful landscapes.Where is Mulan's grandmother? With the cricket? That's hilarious, why take it away? It develops into the entire story of how Mulan brings dishonor to her family but instead we have a spider that jumps.Again, the soundtracks are iconic, they're funny, powerful. Disney is all about singing and the scenery and this director took that all away.Mulan cutting off her hair to blend in with the army, where is this? Because then she has the knot and all of the sudden later in the film she removes the knot and has beautiful LONG hair. I ain't a hair stylist but this is pretty stupid.Mushu? You took away Mushu to resemble ""realism"" but instead we have a Phoenix that is utterly useless, a witch that resembles the raven which is a pointless overpowered character, and huns that run on fortress walls with a vertical incline, no ropes, nothing, just like Spiderman would (I'm literally laughing out loud at this point), and --to you gamers-- no fall damage apparently. But hey, take away Mushu.Mulan's three pals on the animated movie are gone, which those roles brought so much life into Mulan.The dialogue is dull, it's a very lazy script.Mulan's captain and captain's father are gone as well, so we don't have that possible romance between the foot soldier and the captain going on.The entire plot prior to the battle and the avalanche makes no sense. Guys, hear me out, it makes NO SENSE; Forget about what everyone has mentioned that Mulan gives chase to the cavalry and they disappear but instead finds the witch which she's constantly talking to and a dagger knocks her out to realize she has to loosen up her hair in order to have her skills back, rides back to save everyone, jumps up 20 feet into the air kicking off spears, and suddenly sneaks around somehow without being spotted to flank from behind, pop some arrows to get their attention. (Good, we're all caught up); the catapults, they're awesome, the Imperial army hunkers down like a testudo formation and suddenly there are more testudos! But they're getting annihilated by the catapults whom have superb accuracy... but... all of the sudden they launch one at Mulan whenever she gets their attention and miss? Instead hit the snow on the mountainside creating the avalanche? Okay...The entire battle develops in a rather flat landscape, but when the avalanche is approaching, no one from the Imperial army has visual of the avalanche because they're below a ridge out of nowhere??? I thought they were on testudo formation with no cover but now they're beside a ridge. OKAY.Everyone is on testudo, nobody saw what Mulan did, she gets called out and that script still makes no sense to me whatsoever.The location of the Emperor's kidnapping makes no sense. The stage after the battle is about the huns getting to the emperor to kill him but hold him hostage for who knows how long. The raven and Mulan becoming bffs make no sense, just because they're women in a movie doesn't mean they have to get along...The phoenix, like I said, nonexistent.Loyal, Brave, True. This is Mulan's script that's the only thing that makes sense.I'm done.
People, the name of the film is Mulan; if it was named the Phoenix warrior or something else then yes, this would've been acceptable kind of like the movie ""House of the flying daggers""--if this is what they were aiming for, it'd be awesome.",Mulan
2251,jlee-53789,"I'm curious, were we watching the same movie?",10,14 September 2020,"I'm not convinced that the rest of the reviewers actually ""care"" about Chinese culture nor our history. Because if you truly cared about Mulan's story, you would know that there have been numerous films and TV shows about Mulan and her actual history. Go watch those and then ask yourself if you actually care. This is Disney, they've changed every folk lore and fairy tale regardless of culture.We have one group of ""reviewers"" who are upset because the story doesn't follow the history, then we have another group of ""reviewers"" upset because it didn't follow the original 1998 cartoon. Pick one... or appreciate the film for what it is. Then we have people giving 1 star reviews because of Liu Yifei's comment about the HK police? What does that have anything to do with Disney and everyone else involved, take it up with Liu Yifei.I thought the movie was funny, charming, told an amazing story and captured my culture as close as it possibly could. You can't jam thousands of years of history in a 2 hour film. The story of Mulan, while not 100% historically accurate, doesn't shy away from what the message of the film actually is; loyal, brave and true, it is literally written on her sword and repeated throughout the film. The cast and crew did their best and it shows that this film was not slept on by Disney.Please stop bashing films based on your political views or because it's not something YOU wanted it to be, there are a lot more people involved in this film and boycotting it hurts more than just the actress in question.

I saw a Father's struggle wanting to allow his daughter to be who she is vs how society expects a daughter shd be; how both succumb under pressure to conform to finally suppress the 'chi'. 'Chi' in Chinese means 'energy' which boys presumely have plenty so it is ok to be active whilst girls are supposed to be gentle, soft, subdued. Active girls (tomboys) are frowned upon. Whilst the original ballad focuses on the message about filial piety (honouring family), this version focuses first about being 'TRUE' about oneself and accepting who you are (many scenes point to the last word on the sword) and laid in the original message in the end (honouring family) with a new word added into the new sword. The witch was to depict how a rejection of one true self by society can create a monster out of a person.It did not try to take the focus away with a unnecessary love story or music score. It wasn't to entertain by infusing humor of 3 goons. It was not a movie to entertain.

2257,aliciawynonatjahjadi,It Hurt Itself in Its Confusion,1,15 September 2020,"Mulan really has the potential to be a successful live action remake but they've blown it. I pirated this movie and I still want my $30 back. To summarize:
1. They turned Mulan from a relatable character with actual flaws and character development into a Mary Sue. The moral of the story changes from ""Through hard work and strong will, everyone can utilize their own strength to show that they are equally capable"" to ""Women can only be equal to men if they have some superpower"". They basically made a Chinese Elsa out of Mulan.
2. Unnecessary changes. They took out all the fun aspects of the movie: the songs, the side characters, and the pivotal moments--and changes it into something...less. All of the side characters are underutilized especially the witch who's there because of.....girl power? All of Mulan's soldier friends lack depth and I honestly only realized they're supposed to be Ling, Yao, and Chien Po after they spoke out the lyrics to A Girl Worth Fighting For (a cringe-worthy moment...either do it or don't).
3. Ugly acting and horrible editing. Liu Yifei has only what...3 expressions during the whole movie? She shed 1 (one) tear for her father, slightly annoyed face when knocked down by a fellow soldier, and the rest is a flat, boring face. It's like she's so afraid of looking ugly. And don't get me started on the editing. The jump cuts in many scenes are so jarring and disorienting that the audience really can't place themselves in the movie.
4. Culturally inaccurate. They say they take out Mushu to make this live action more ""realistic"" but they really didn't do much. What they do is romanticize as much orientalism as possible. Westernized view of Chinese values/legends and even then most of the details are messed up. What is that ugly makeup? That Southern China house for a Northern China legend? Wrong interpretation of Qi (not Chi)? Western phoenix? A witch??? Honestly I could go on.Seriously this movie is a trainwreck right from the very beginning until the end. They are trying SO hard yet they flop. I guess that's what you get when you don't involve any actual Chinese person in the filmmaking process, but still try to make this film to please the Chinese government...but not providing Chinese subtitles in your platform. Lmao Disney is a joke I'm sure Walt is stirring in his grave.Don't waste your $30 guys. Seriously.",Mulan

Instead, Disney chose to create a more ""realistic"" Mulan for this live action film.If you're looking for a film with beautiful visuals and cool action choreography that you can probably watch with your entire family to pass the time while eating dinner then this movie is OKAY. If you're looking for more engaging and heartfelt film then it will certainly fall short though. The cast is attractive and talented but the story and direction is very lackluster and missing the true essence of the original fable.Mulan is the story of an ordinary Chinese girl who broke away from tradition to save her father and protecting her family's honor. It a powerful story of strong female protagonist who finds love and overcomes adversity to eventually save her country. Unfortunately, this journey and struggle is mostly lost in the new live action film since the main protagonist already has mystical energy which gives her superhuman abilities from the beginning of the film.You can watch this movie while talking with family and friends over dinner and not miss much by tuning in every now and again. The story is predictable (even more so with the new changes) and a missed opportunity overall. Just a pretty picture but not much more than that.",Mulan

The overtrying that is put into this movie's story is absurd. And even then, they didn't let the story manifest in anyway. Instead they are presenting their ""2020"" activist aspect through a heroine. Mulan, once one of the most brave Disney princesses, is being ripped , as she doesn't have to try and fight for what the original movie Mulan did .
The editing is worthless ,gave me a bad headache and the cgi had nothing to add to it whatsoever. And lastly , this new Disney that's working on these live action movies HAS to decide to either commit to the bloody songs or not embed them at all to them movie. I don't won't to spoil , but so far this live action move has done the worst job so far regarding the songs ( let's not remember how ""be prepared"" got a smack in the face as well .....) . If someone wants to not compare these two movies , then again the characters are so hollow , they don't contribute in any way and the adds in the film like the phoenix instead of mushu ,or Mulan arachnophobia etc just didn't help the story grow. In general , I would love if Disney just quit making these movies, cus apparently they can't do any better .",Mulan

2268,blackwoodvintage,Uplifting beauty,9,16 September 2020,"This film was never intended to replace the animated version, and thankfully does not attempt to. I enjoyed this film immensely- but I watched it with an open mind as a stand-alone story, not as an exact re-telling of the original. With excellent performances from the entire cast and amazing stunts from Yifei Liu and veteran Donnie Yen (whose sheer speed with his swordplay alone is incredible), alongside breathtaking cinematography, I have to say this film is a favorite of mine. Yes, there are surreal elements to this film (as seen in Hero and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon), so there is implied, heightened storytelling rather than obvious or overt humor and plot. So if you can remain open-minded, this is a worthy film. If you want to see the original- rewatch the animation!",Mulan

2275,Gamarleton,I really wanted to like this movie,2,18 September 2020,"I really wanted to like the Mulan Remake.The original Disneys Mulan was my favourite out of all Disney films and still is too this day, and I will always love that movie for what it is.
I was so excited to see that they were making a remake, that it was supposedly going to be more realistic and serious, and that it was a live action movie. But after watching the movie I was greatly disappointed.Now I'm not the type of person to relentlessly hate on movies, I don't even usually write reviews. I just accept movies for what they are and consider both the fact that being behind the scenes in the makings of a movie can be harder than it looks and that if a movie tries to portray something in a way I wouldn't that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie.
I'm also a firm believer that just because a movie is a remake, or goes off the same story like a sequel, doesn't mean it has to be exactly the first movie. Along with the fact that I'm aware our expectations often come to ruin a movie for us.
But the Mulan live action remake was a disaster.The first thing that caught me off guard was the very CGI element of the first scene where we see Mulan use this ""chi"". This is not an uncommon theme nor way of filming in east asia and it didn't really strike me as that strange, but this is when I realized this movie was not going to be so realistic after all. I also realized that Mulan was going to be considered someone with great power even from childhood, which made me feel like this was an entirely differents story, a story of someone other than Mulan.
Still mindset on giving the movie a fair chance, I decided to see the movie as an attempt at being just more serious, rather than actually realistic. And in a way I was more right on that than I realized.Every decision anyone makes in this entire movie is entirely nonsensical. The only one that isn't is Mulan leaving to go to war instead of her father, not to mention in this movie they pay no credits to make her difficult decision feel like anything... from the smaller things like hiding a spider on the table and risk her image making the weirdest moves ever, instead of making everyone else in the room aware of it or simply ignoring it, to other characters in the movie acting like a child making up imaginary stories in the playground. I felt from early on, the script would be hard to swallow.Remember how in the first movie we got to see Mulan overcome the struggles of her biological disadvantage along with the disadvantage of being raised as a woman with no real fighting experience and come out on top using her wit and skill and by training hard alongside the men in the army and outsmarting them during a test that genuinely takes some strategizing?
In the live action remake, Mulan is just already way stronger than everyone else due to her chi, the movie clearly portrays her being slower than the men she trains with, enough to annoy her to use her chi to gain the upper hand and then getting upset. Despite the fact that she's now portraying herself as a male, which according to this movie is how things would work in china... But none of this works like actual china.This makes you feel like the only redeeming quality she has on the battlefield is her chi, and by default makes her a weak character.
Even in east asian films where they use powers that seem to be outside the physical ability, it's always something you have to train. Even the ones with mary sues like this one turns out to be, they also have to train that. But in this movie, Mulan just has it all figured out already as a child.So in the middle of the war of very few small platoons, for whatever reasons they didn't call in more extras, Mulan decides that hours after promising her platoon that she will protect them, her entire platoon gets shot down and she straigt up leaves, riding off into the mountains after a number of men.
This is where she meets a woman who also has ""the power of chi"" (The cultural missunderstandings are grave...) and also the power of shapeshifting. Because why? I don't know.
This is part of a type of magic that in east asian culture and film is usually considered forbidden. So why is she using it? Because she's part of the bad guys? I think this unlikely because in east asian film it's not even used by them, usually.
Along with the witch trope not being a thing in china either, but apparently they thought this movie needed some western standards!As she gets knocked out and takes some time to nap before going back into battle, she decides that in order to ""make her chi clean"" she has to drop her disguise, to be true to herself. In my honest opinion there was no reason for her to come out like this right then and there, because she would've been killed for her decieit, that's how it worked.
Along with the fact that in order to be true to herself, she could have focused on why she was doing this, instead of the fact that she was forced to lie due to society's rules and expectations tied to the law.
But we don't get Mulan's audience with herself to figure out what to do.
She just straight up gets on her horse, and on her ride back to her army she throws her fathers beloved armor on the ground, the one thing that is meant to protect her insides from getting punctured and slashed open, all the way back, scattering it between the mountains, straight up ditching it like it was trash.
Clearly her fathers belongings, and her life, mean nothing to her.
And she also takes the time to let out her long hair in the wind so it can get in her face mid combat.When she decides to reveal her true identity, before gaining any form of r espect to preotect her from the obvious repercussions of their laws, she's exiled and warned she will get executed if she shows her face again.
This isn't far from reality, but what happens next? She goes to do just that, show her face, and talk to them again because she has information about the enemy's next move.While I could imagine if she was lucky this may grant her to be spared for the purpose of bringing this information to them, what actually happens is that the general just straight up makes her the leader of her platoon and sends her to take care of it.
Are you joking? The man who told her she'd be executed hours ago, makes her the leader.
Why does this feel like an over-dramatic discord server with a bunch of children as admins?
This would never happen in the real world, not back then nor now.
But wait, it gets worse!:The king decides to casually stroll into a construction site by himself in the middle of an attack on the capital as if nothing was going on. In which he gets captured, obviously.
Mulan is making her way to save the emperor, and as she comes on site, the big bad guy shoots an arrow at her, and for absolutely no reason whatsoever the witch that Mulan has been fighting throws herself in front of the arrow.
She gives her life for someone she just met, knows nothing about and have no history of an alliance with.
There's no indication as to what her strategy is either. She just does.
Speaking of strategy, of all the power she promised having, why is this her move?Mulan decides to go home to remedy the shame she caused her family, fair.
She goes home, everything turns out to be happily ever after and I'm not even really watching anymore because this movie made no sense and none of these characters have any meaning to me and I'm just so disinterested in it at this point.Mulan was a real person in history. I understand if someone wants to make a more serious movie about her, and not wanting to include a comical relief spirit dragon. But this movie cannot be taken seriously at all.
I also understand if they don't want to make it the same exact movie and only make light references to the original movie soundtracks, but the way they implemented the literal song lyrics in bits and pieces really awkwardly made me cringe, and the nonsensical plot was a disappointment.tldr;
2/10 - Written like a 14 year old making bad mary sue fanfiction with terrible missreadings of chinese culture and more than bordering on disrespecting it.

2276,doomhandw,Movie was horrible,1,18 September 2020,"Warning: Does contain spoilersHonestly if I could give this movie a 0 rating I would, when I heard that a Mulan movie was being made I thought I would get dazzaled by nostalgia, but instead I was left with more regret than content. Firstly not a single song that was in the original was in the movie...not one and I was really hoping I would hear ""be a man"" I was ready to sing along to the music but non. That's not a major part of the film but brought about a certain sense of connection with the characters, but I digress no music.Secondly, and I can't put the blame entirely on the production team but Mulan's village looked completely different, when I say completely I mean like a whole new village entirely, no small river, no cherry blossoms and no grass, I mean come on, did the writers not watch the original at all.I would also like to point out the removal and addition of certain characters, Mulan's grandmother is missing, cri-kee is missing, Mushu isn't Mushu he's a fricken bird, and what happened to Li Shang??? I mean he became Mulan's husband, I digress many characters went missing, hence certain aspects of the movie just didn't feel right. And another thing who the hell is that shape shifting eagle I mean,Fourthly, many of the scenes did not take place or were not acted correctly, I found myself lost for words at how bad some of the scenes were reenacted, the army training, I know normal people won't be able to climb up a vertical log but come on man climbing up a mountain with buckets in hand is that the best you can do. The fight scene on the mountain",Mulan

She was inspirational in some ways as she managed to obtain a lot of things through her determination and her intelligence. She showed the ""family spirit"" when she selflessly joined the Army instead of her old father. She was a figure who both young boys and girls can be related to. Now look at the new Mulan, what we have is an another Chosen One. You are born special, so you will not need to train or even try? What the heck? Is it really a good mentality to show in a movie?

I like the color editing and movement of this film very much. This is the level that 2020 should be. But I am really disappointed with this movie. The reason why Mulan is liked by the whole world is because she is an ordinary person and was born in an ordinary family. She bravely broke the rules of the world and went to the army for the family. Rather than a magician using the so-called CHI to fly . And the witch is completely unnecessary in my opinion. If this role is deleted, it will not have any impact on the plot.",Mulan
2287,oncezhu,Mulan is not the ordinary female role-model but a princess with gifted talent in this movie,5,21 September 2020,"As a Chinese, I would say it might be one of the best movies that I have ever seen that a western director interpreted as well as possible about a Chinese story and Chinese culture, although there are still some awkward parts but I really appreciate the efforts. Actors, CG effects and costumes are cool and shows respect to history and culture.
However, I am really not into this story. And I think the worst part of this movie is that it twisted the spirits of Mu Lan and misunderstood the meaning of ""Loyal, Love..."". If you have studied the original poem of Mu Lan, you will understand better about the legendary story. In this movie, Mu Lan is more like a typical Disney Princess with gifted talent. But in the original poem, Mu Lan is an ordinary girl like us that followed by her heart, pursued her nature and made her own choice with courage and efforts. That is why her story has become a legend through 1700 years. She has been struggled, has been fighting with prejudice and difficulties, but she made efforts, grew up and become stronger. The nature and spirit of Mulan is about how a person finds and pursues her/his inner needs and ture-self and defeat prejudice and inner fears. Mu Lan goes to fight in the war because she loves her family and she wants to protect her people not because of some ridiculous ""Loyal, truth..."" This is not a Qing Dynasty guide book for woman! Mulan rejected the king's promotion because she wants a simple and natural life, not because she felt sorry to her father or ""Loyal..."". What Mu Lan did is all because of her own choices and nature of her. It has nothing to do with the tenets. I got part of this movie is trying to tell girls that any girl can be a hero. However it doesn't leave me this impression, instead I feel awkward and offended. Because the tenets ""Loyal..."" repeated too much in the movie, and they sound like the tenets which teach women about what good women you have to be in the feudalistic time in ancient China.
That's why I have to say that this movie is more like a third-rate fantasy martial-arts movie. It doesn't touched my heart at all.",Mulan

I'm Chinese and I was so excited to see tons of Asian actors get roles in this but they deserved a better screenwriter /producer / director... somethingMy least favorite part is this crap with a witch and how there's now funked up magic now. The original animated developed her character and had her grow from a girl scared to save her father to learning discipline and hard work in the army. Instead they totally MAKE FUN of authentic Chinese CHI!!! It's not some psycho magic.I was so excited for the authentic cast and wanted to see some great fighting scenes. Instead you don't know who's who half the time or where they are. You also get this constant rotating of the camera during the fight scenes that'll give you a headache. So sad.",Mulan
2312,jessbythebay7123,Very disappointing,2,9 December 2020,"The original Mulan is one of my favorite Disney movies of all time - the characters, the story line, and most importantly the message are among the best to have ever come out of the Disney studio. This remake was a huge letdown. They changed pretty much all of the characters and the moral of the story to awkwardly make it fit into a kung fu genre film with an element of wokeness that nobody asked for. Ironically, the original story was far more empowering to women - it stressed that with courage, dedication, hard work and perseverance a woman can overcome all odds and run with the best of her male counterparts - she can even rise up to become a hero! The new version gives Mulan magical powers aka ""Chi"" that she apparently has from birth and that naturally set her apart. So the message here is if you are blessed with magical capabilities then (and only then) can you can fight amongst men and become a hero. That is not an empowering message for anyone without magical powers. Another message randomly thrown in: if you don't flaunt your ""true self"" or in this case your true gender identity, then you will die. The character development in the new version is underwhelming and you end up not particularly caring about any of the main characters, including Mulan. And they took out the comedic element of Eddie Murphy - which isn't the most tragic part even though I enjoyed the Mushu character in the original - but then they replaced him with underdeveloped characters like the witch who doesn't really add anything of value to the story outside of more magic, stunts, strange costumes and an odd last-minute relationship with Mulan. Watch this movie for free but only so you can tell Disney to stop ruining the classics. 1.5 stars for Donnie Yen (I enjoy the Ip Man series) and Jet Li.",Mulan

Takes all the character and story out of Mulan as a character and treats her like she has superpowers and that's it. It doesn't exemplify what and who Mulan is.

Li Shang is replaced with some random guy (I think) I can't even tell who the characters are anymore It didn't even have a majority of the things in the og movie. Mulan doesn't look like Mulan. The emperor's palace thing looks weird. During the scene where the song ""I'm going to make a man out of you"" it looked nothing like the og. It had a few of the same element but it was still bad.

All the other people are hating on it because they want it to be an exact copy of the animated cartoon version. I believe this film surpassed the cartoon version and the special effects were really good. Overall, this film deserves a 10/10 easily.

2324,seppedelanghe,A glimpse of what could have been,4,14 January 2021,"Mulan (2020) is one of the live action remakes that should have never been. As a child the original Mulan (1998) was one of my favourite movies. Because of that, when it released I wanted to hold off at first, so I would not ruin the memory of the experience/joy I have of watching this movie when is a child. But like a lot of people, I jumped on the nostalgia train and watched it. I started watching with great excitement, sadly however that did not last long.The movie's beginning is maybe one of the worst things about it. A great movie starts with a good opening and an introduction of the characters in an interesting way to establish a connection with the viewers. With this movie, I felt super disconnected from Mulan and the other characters. It feels like the people who made this remake, struggled to decide where to draw the line on realism. Right when you start to feel like Mulan is a human that has a hard time fitting in, something viewers could relate too, she pulls out some acrobatic moves that defy the laws of physics. Possible connection, gone. And this is just one occasion of where the over the top movements are in the way of connecting.
These movements and other unrealistic occurrences wouldn't have bothered me however, if it was clear that they took a non realistic approach and included things like a weird talking dragon, which I was disappointed not to find. With this movie the line is somewhere awkwardly in the middle.The challenger for possible worst thing about the movie is the lack of breaks/pauzes. This might be just me, but this become more noticeable with every conversation in the movie. Little pauzes in conversations or scenes can build excitement or a sense of tention. There where many occasions where I felt these breaks where missing.To compensate with the two worst things about the movie I just pointed out, I'll tell you what's great about it. The scenery and cinematography. The landscapes are a beautiful thing to look at in between the conversations and storytelling.In short, the lack of little breaks/tention builders and great introduction make you feel disconnected from the movie and it's characters. A documentary would probably have been a better option to spend 200 million dollars on.And yes, sadly this remake did ruin my great memory of the original Mulan.",Mulan

2329,justinandsheaba,Based on everything,1,18 November 2020,The story was weak. Not only that but so far from the original movie and the true story that it should be called something else. The original story is of a woman who was willing to risk death to save her father. She fought off an army of people who were superior (and in the real story not lead by a woman) she was able to defend her country in this without magic powers of some magic unkillable bicycle kicking woman the real story is extremely impressive this is over done and fake in every way simply to say that there were women in the strongest roles,Mulan

There doesn't have to be a Mushu or the catchy songs for the tale of Mulan to be good. When I heard it was going to be more of a martial arts movie I was pumped but the movie is cringey at best. The overall story is good and some of the special effects are good too. I didn't mind the introduction of new characters, concepts, or the removal of the romantic side story. The editing in general is terrible though. It's choppy and lacks cohesion. My guess is a poor production team glued this could-have-been-excellent reimagining into a sloppy unpolished mess.

After reading the reviews I was fully prepaired to hate it, but it was free on Disney + and Mulan is one of my favorite cartoon movies so I watched it anyway. First, if you are coming in to this with the expectation of just seeing the 1998 cartoon in live action, you are going to be disappointed. Unlike the other Disney live actions, this is not them telling the same story with a few changes. This is more like a completely different movie altogether about the same character. I wouldnt even put it in the same genre as the other. Kind of like how the Disney beauty and the beast is different from the Brothers Grim version, and different from the CW version, and that 90s show version that was on back in the day. There are no talking animals, musical numbers, or funny grandmas. Its a more serious movie so if you are going into it expecting light hearted kiddy fun like the cartoon or the other Disney live action remakes, you arent going to like it. However, it is a really good movie with breathtaking scenery and some cool action scenes. So if you go into it with the mindset of just wanting to watch a cool fantacy/ action flick thats clean enough for the whole family, you should thoroughly enjoy this.",Mulan

The story was convincing, the acting flawless, the scenery picturesque, and the movie was really funny to boot! As compared to all the other reviewers, I actually liked the added character of the bitter witch, who gets all sold out to Mulan, because she is sticking to her values and showing her that there is a better way.

2350,megantvmelaniefan,Stunning movie but sadly controversial,5,5 December 2020,"It's not a bad movie by any means, it's cinematically beautiful but the place they filmed and the lead actresses failures and controversies make this hard to enjoy.",Mulan
2351,karenbeth-05637,It's Disney's Version of a Martial Arts Action Movie,7,5 December 2020,"Watching this, at first I thought it was a bad movie. Then I had a realization. This isn't a remake of the cartoon, it's not a princess movie, it's not a fairytale, it's not the normal way Disney does folklore. Live action Mulan is a Samurai movie. It's got the sword fighting, the improbably/impossible acrobatic fighting, historical setting, honor, and even magic/mysticism.Of course the problem with that is that Samurai are Japanese, not Chinese. So, it's more accurate to call it a Martial Arts Action Movie set in a fantasy version of ancient China.The quasi-historical setting has some problems too. Disney has a tendency to pick and choose things based on aesthetics rather than historic accuracy in their stories. They need to make better use of cultural experts so as to avoid problems like this. In this case, that round village house that she lived in wouldn't have been built until several centuries after the story of Mulan was supposed to take place. Also, it was in an entirely different region of China. So, that part isn't great.Personally, I think if you go into it expecting a martial arts, action movie you'll probably like it okay. But you need to have that expectation going into it. If you are expecting something like the cartoon, you'll be in the wrong mindset to enjoy it because you'll be expecting entirely the wrong genre.As for the plot, I like that it doesn't end in her getting married. It actually ends in her getting a job offer that uses her skills and brings honor to her family. And I like that they didn't repeat the cartoon version's cross-dressing for comic effect which is super cringy now.I don't think it's a great Disney movie, but so long as you are in the right mindset going into it, it is enjoyable.",Mulan
2352,hsam_bc-log,Not as bad as the poor reviews indicate,9,6 December 2020,"Before I write this review, the disclaimer I should state is that I look at all movies (especially remakes) as standalone movies. I don't think it's fair to compare remakes to the original. This is because anyone who goes to the trouble of remaking a movie will most likely make changes to the original to add a bit a uniqueness to the film. While not always true, this is true in most cases. If you think about it, that makes sense. If the remake is an exact duplicate of the original, why bother looking at the remake? There just isn't a large enough market for that kind of film.
That is the basis of my rating. Judging the movie on it's own merits, without comparing to the original, I think this a fine movie. The cinematography is excellent, although it does suffer from not being in the theater, but that is not the fault of the movie. I think it's fair to handicap it for that reason. The acting is fine. While not superlative, I think it was more than adequate. If I handicap the acting, then I would actually rank the acting higher. I'll explain later. Story, scenery, action, etc. were all top notch. There were a few slow spots, which is the basis behind my dropping it a star. Otherwise, if I judge this movie on its own merits, I think it's easily a 9. However, I think it might be more interesting to explain why I think all the people who ranked this movie poorly are wrong.
Many of the negative reviews were based on comparisons to the original. No music, no Mushu, etc. I already mentioned earlier that I think it's wrong to judge a movie, even a remake, by comparing to the original. I believe that kind of criteria is unfair because any remake most likely contains changes from the original. If your favorite bit from the original is dropped, then you automatically hate the remake. I think that is an unfair criteria.
Another common criticism to the movie was the lack of historical accuracy. For example, the tulous that Mulan grew up in didn't exist at the time of the ballad. Additionally, the tulous are in a different part of China than where the Rouran battles were fought. I don't disagree these or historically inaccurate, but any film, especially Disney films, are created for entertainment, not to be a history lesson. Additionally, the primary market for the film is America. The average American knows little of Chinese history at any level of detail so this probably wouldn't bother them. I think of it in terms of what I have seen in American movies. It's not uncommon for location shooting to have sequential scenes that don't make sense. For example, a guy walks down a street, turns a corner and is in a separate part of town. They do this for the cinematic and photographic qualities, not to be geographically accurate, So I handicap Mulan for this as I look at it in the same way.
The last thing I'll counter the criticism on is the acting, in particular Liu YiFei. I have read numerous criticisms as to how people didn't like it. Actually, I thought she did a pretty good job. Her acting skills are very good. But I also handicapped that because she is Chinese by birth and Mandarin is her native language. I have seen her acting in Mandarin language films and she is very good, and very talented. I think it must be difficult to speak in your non-native language, but also enormously difficult to act in your non-native language.
Along those lines, and my earlier comment on accuracy, if people were so bent on that, then this film should have been shot in Mandarin and we should have English sub-titles. However, as I mentioned earlier, this film was created primarily for the English speaking audiences, so a lot of compromises were made.
That leads me to my final comment. One of the biggest downsides to this film that I see that led to the criticisms were, in my opinion, a result of the compromises that had to be made to satisfy the worldwide market. Invariably, when you compromise that much, you wind up with people dissatisfied everywhere. The lack of understanding of Chinese culture by Americans led to several compromises that probably set off the Chinese audience which made them unhappy. Another thing that hurt, I believe, was the enormously bad reviews the film got prior to overseas release. That can't help but influence opinion. But as I mentioned earlier, I think most of the bad reviews were unwarranted.
Basically, as a standalone film, without using the original film as a prejudicial comparison, I think this is actually a really good movie.",Mulan

And please don't say that because it's a movie they couldn't keep all the fantastical stuff, see how they handled the Beauty and the Beast and it was perfect.After researching it seems that this movie got heavily censored by China's oppressive regime. For example the lack of Mushu seems to be because China thought it would trivialize their culture. Really?The producer and writer for this turd of a movie should be ashamed.

2358,cef-27649,Mulan for a different audience,10,6 December 2020,"The 2020 Mulan is for a different audience from the original cartoon Mulan. This Mulan is not a cartoon, it is not a musical, nor is it filled with comic relief, but the movie was great. It was genius to be able to take the simple movie and transform it into a movie about a young woman going against a system that de-valued her. The progression of events followed the cartoon very well, but there was an element of reality superimposed on the cartoon so seamlessly that it almost made me forget the cartoon. Yet, the elements were there, the little girl chasing the farm animals, the offer of engagement ruined, the call to war for each family, the theft of her father's sword and joining the war under false pretense, the avalanche, and so on. The witch was the element that confused me at the beginning of the movie. Hayabusa, Shan Yu's bird did spy on Mulan in the original movie and as the movie progressed, I could see the connection to the witch in the 2020 version of Mulan.This movie allowed Mulan to develop. It allowed her to search her soul and step up to be her honest and true self, rather than be exposed by others. I believe the bad reviews are from people who were looking for the same movie only with real people. This is an excellent movie. It has elements of history and culture that intrigue and interest me.The end was wonderful and quite surprising to me. I recommend it to people who are looking for a movie than contains social change, personal conflict, self sacrifice, family loyalty and love.",Mulan

2360,meggygray,Amazing take on the original if you don't compare!,8,6 December 2020,"I feel people were expecting it to be too much like the original. I agree I love a Disney song, mushu, the comedic characters and romance in the original and would have loved to hear her sing but as a new interpretation I felt the movie was amazing in its own way and these aspects would have possibly taken away from the strong message that was in this movie and the more real approach.I loved seeing the empowerment of Mulan and her speaking from a woman's point of view to the other warriors without them even knowing she is a woman. This movie shows how strong and powerful woman can be and although the witch seemed random she was showing how Mulan could have become.I was hoping for romance at the end but I agree with Mum that it shows a woman doesn't always need a man and can be strong on he, although I am secretly hoping for a second film where maybe some romance does spark.People need to watch this as if it's a new film, enjoy the amazing visuals and not expect it to be exactly like the original. People complained the lion king was too similar so you can't really win.",Mulan
2361,hughmsmith,"Not what we expected, but loved it!",9,7 December 2020,"Just watched the new Mulan with my family on Disney+. We didn't know what to expect but we're pleasantly surprised with the strong storyline, characters, action scenes, suspense and ending...I even got a little teared up at the end but loved that my daughters felt inspired as ""warriors.' I credit Disney with reimagining one of their most iconic animated films into an action packed family film. Would my kids have loved a musical? Sure. This isn't that, which is ok. I think those who didn't like this version would have preferred a remake like the Lion King, which was the same exact movie. We loved it and I know you will too.",Mulan

I like that there is no singing because then it applies to more people. Many guys do not like all the singing....but now with no singing everyone likes it!! Mulan is a nice movie with awesome sword moves and fighting. (Note: I am a girl, and I am glad there is no singing and lots of fighting.) Just watch it, then you can see if you like it or not. If you don't like it, at least you watched it! If you do, then you have another favorite movie!!",Mulan
2363,miladydo-39824,Not sure why all the bad reviews,10,9 December 2020,I loved it. I liked the cartoon and I liked this version too. Maybe people just expect too much from a movie.

2368,mlissatrujillo,Dishonor on your cow...,1,11 December 2020,"Another massive letdown. They somehow managed to strip away everything that made the original movie so amazing. I understand the desire to create something different from the original, but it was so poorly executed.
I thought there were some beautiful scenes in this film, but the moments of good cinematography were GREATLY overshadowed by the ridiculous slow motion matrix-esqe shots and the horrendous close ups complete with strange filter effects.
The most disappointing aspect of this film for me was the complete lack of characterization. The villains were nowhere near as scary as Shan Yu, the soldiers felt like after thoughts, Mulan's family was uninteresting. Shockingly in a cast full of lackluster characters, Mulan somehow managed to be the most boring of them all.
All in all, this was another lazy, unnecessary live action remake, completely devoid of even a fraction of the heart present in the original.
As disappointed as I am with this movie, I am more disappointed in myself that I expected anything other than what it was.",Mulan

But hey if it's gonna be just another remake that's like the original there's no point in remaking it, right?!? I mean why bother. I like the film cos it underscores the cultural animosity against women. That bit is emphasized quite a bit and I think it's necessary to provide the modern viewer the context and milieu in which Mulan becomes extraordinary. Also like the fact that the romance does not define the character. It's there in the background but Mulan's identity and character is not defined by it.There are some fantasy elements and that to me is the only bit that did not ring true. I mean i wljld have been ok seeing a witch and a phoenix in Harry Potter",Mulan

2372,adesertrose,I thought it was great,7,12 December 2020,"The beginning is a little rough but I thought the movie was very entertaining, true to the story, and the best live action re-make so far. I am not sure why it gets such bad reviews honestly. It obviously could not follow the animated one completely but they give it a spin with magic in what seemed to follow the tradition of wuxia/ kung fu movies. I enjoyed it and would watch it again.",Mulan

2374,kyleedavies,Well Disney made a Chinese B movie...,2,13 December 2020,"Bad acting, bad lines, bad plot and the scenes never blended well together. For a Disney movie with lots of resources I expected way more. Also I'm totally okay that there were differences between the cartoon Mulan and this version, however one of the main characteristics of the character Mulan is that she was clever and thought outside of the box. She saved China because she was witty and willing to do things differently than others. In the 2020 version she saved all of China because she had super powers. This gives a completely different feel to the movie, and totally misses the point of what the meaning of the show is all about. And what was up with that Phoenix? It showed up at random times and never really helped her. Mulan is also a movie about family, aren't her ancestors supposed to actually help her not just fly around in times of trouble to show her that they are present?",Mulan
2375,wrgakfcy,Awesome!!!,10,16 December 2020,Enjoyed this Mulan as much as I enjoyed the original! I don't understand the poor reviews. If you watch it as a reimagined movie instead of a remake I think you'll enjoy it too!,Mulan

2377,daivikksanjay,Waste of time,2,17 December 2020,"What more is there to be said Mulan (2020)? It has horrendously edited action scenes, new characters that are pointless, and worst of them all, a plot that is stretched out too thin.
The beauty of the original Mulan was its simplicity. It didn't go on for two hours and instead it was short, had a nice message, and that was it. No stupid witch or Phoenix characters or pointless shots just padding out the runtime.
You can't even defend the CGI, which looks so bad, it almost looks like a parody!
In fact, I'll go even as far to say that the whole movie looks like a parody. When I was watching this, I was thinking to myself that there was no way in hell this was made by the same company that made the original. There is no way!
Now I did get some ironic laughs, but at the end of the day, it's just a joyless, overly-long and pointless movie.
I haven't given it 1/10 because as I said I did get a couple of ironic laughs but, ..........it's still pretty bad. I do not recommend this movie to anyone and I'm giving it a 2/10.",Mulan

2379,bubbling-27472,Distortion of the entire message of the original,1,17 December 2020,"I must admit that I had high expectations for this movie considering the original is my favourite Disney film from my childhood. The controversies surrounding it before it's release cemented for me that I wouldn't enjoy it nearly as much, and I wasn't going to watch it at all until my sister put it on last night.My favourite thing about the original Mulan is the message it sends to young girls. Mulan goes to war to protect her father and when she starts off, she's not good at any of the training because she's never experienced it before. However, through hard-work, determination and intelligence she works to become a valued member of the army. Young girls can watch this film and see how completely normal women can achieve as much as anyone else. This film shoves this entire sentiment right in the bin. By making Mulan have special powers, it tells girls that you can only be on par with men when you have superpowers, which is straight up an awful message.Beyond this, the movie is dull and flat without any of the original music or slightly interesting dialogue between characters. The idea that songs makes a film less serious is so flawed by itself and without it this film barely distinguishes between different emotional beats. For example, the abrupt ending of 'A girl worth fighting for' in the original hits so much harder emotionally than the burning village in this film. Furthermore, all the comedy is completely taken out of this film. I understand they wanted a more mature tone, but isn't this still meant to be a kids film? The writing throughout this film is weak, lacks any sense of comedy, and distorts any values of honour by just repeating the fact that you need to have honour over and over again.I have many issues with this film without even going into the superiority of the plot points in the original film. I can excuse changing points as to not copy the original completely, and I can excuse getting rid of characters like Mushu, however I cannot excuse the total lack of awareness these filmmakers have displayed of the original message of Mulan and the general bad filmmaking.",Mulan
2380,bixbyal,Very bad,1,18 December 2020,This movie was nothing like the animation. I grew up with Mulan animation and it was my favorite movie but I was very disappointed in this movie. It might as well have a different title because it'a nothing like the real movie!,Mulan

2382,kelseyward-31350,Not impressed,3,20 December 2020,"After hearing some not so great opinions about this film I came to watch it with an open mind, accepting it as its own movie not a remake. I felt little connection with the characters and I think the lack of sound tracks doesn't help at all, surprised for Disney. Although I approached this as its own movie there are some things that I felt shouldn't have been left out. The cutting of her hair being the main one, cutting of a girls hair brings a lot of empowerment and really pulls on those heart strings - I don't even recall there being a scene where they focus on her putting her hair in a bun! Why does she take off all her armour when she's riding back into battle - like I get it you're female keep ya clothes on, taking your hair out the bun would of done the trick - the front of the chest plate was already damaged and undone from the throwing knife. Lastly I did not like the witch character.. was not needed and she definitely didn't need to shape shift it was like an easy way out for the movie to hurry up - ""loyal, brave, true"" was repeated throughout the whole movie, instead of using her magic to get the emperors soldiers to stand down why couldn't have used disloyalty, cowardly and untrue people to turn against the emperor - more believable and would give your viewers more drama to enjoy.Plus points - The scenery is beautiful and actors were great!",Mulan

I thought I was going to see a real live version of the animated mulan but instead I got something completely different, and what was worse there was another women involved which made no sense to the original movie and what sucked so bad is that I didn't get to see mushu or Shang. Atleast keep the same people. The trailer was way better than the movie itself.",Mulan
2385,nicolecondron,Amazing,10,21 December 2020,It was not a remake of the original Mulan rather it was a retelling of a great story. Sure they completely added some things and discarded others but the story itself was incredible. Mulan is my all time favorite Disney movie and I was not offended by this retelling at all. It was a great work of a reimagined story and is truly beautiful my favorite retold Disney story yet.

2389,harrietchiuu,Shallow character development,4,26 December 2020,"Loyalty, Brave, True, Devotion to FamilyIt was a live action that I was very much looking forward to. I thought it was going to be more detailed than the animated version but I feel there are lots of things left unexplained/not developed enough.The qualities required to be a good girl in that period of time are not explained well.
The Matchmaker gets angry due to an accident of Hua Xiu (Mulan's sister) trying to avoid a spider. Instead of making it a mistake of Mulan's 'manliness' or recklessness, this invalidates the anger of the Matchmaker towards Mulan. Also, in the animated version she needs to recite poetry during the meeting with the matchmaker and it emphasises that she is not like the rest and that she has no intention to/cannot become the rest. Therefore the contrast is not shown as thoroughly.
She does not cut her hair like Mulan does in the original animated version. This makes it less emotional because we feel less of the pain and the sacrifice that Mulan has to endure to risk her life for her family.The friendship between Commander Tung and Hua Zhou feels shallow as well. And what is the point of the bird? If you are going to leave Mushu out leave all the magic out please.To conclude, characters are not developed enough to be as gripping as it could be with the storyline.",Mulan
2390,tj-30678,Crappy reviews,10,26 December 2020,"Actually i would rate this lower but with all haters givning it a1 simply becaue they just expected a re-watch of the cheesier animated movie, is nuts.What I liked about the movie:Some magic to explain Mulans impossible abilites, instead of the animated Disney, making these powers unexplained completely.God fighting sceens, much better than the cheesy Hollywood scenes common today with western actresses mostly trying to look cool by static poses , and having super human strengths without any magic or explaination at all.Good acting overall, photo and environments, scenery is wonderful and villains that are not simply pure evil is also refreshing compared to Hollywoods formula.If you think the Disneys animated Mulan is a great emotional movie you love, and expert this to be a remake/re-run , you better just re-watch the Animated Mulan. If you are looking for more of an action movie with better visuals and less rom-com, then this movie is good entertainment and highly underrated.",Mulan

This movie wasn't soulless, it was stoic. I appreciated that the emotions weren't over the top, and think that the the classic Disney humor of the 1998 film would have been the wrong choice for this movie.
Gong Li's character had real depth and was a great foil for Mulan. She was original and refreshing!
Drawbacks: Chi aspect needed to be expanded upon more, and the musical callbacks were weak. The 1998 movie has great music that they failed to capitalize on.",Mulan

None of the soldiers evolve and you don't really get to know them. There are several gaps in the story that only would be filled with the parts from the original story that has been cut away. The ending leaves you on hold, wondering what really happened, and IF something even happened during these app. 2 hours.

I've been holding off watching this movie...due to the bad reviews and everything I've read in the media about it. But I can't believe I let the negative reviews keep me from watching it. It's not a musical, like the original, but original songs are included in an instrumental manner. Many people are upset that it isn't like the original, but Disney put a great spin on it.

If I had to guess I would never believe it came out of the creator of my favorite movies.
The movie was written by someone who never read a book or saw a movie in it's life. a better title for the movie would be ""We let a bot watch 10K hours of mulan and this is what it wrote""
the dialogues were empty, the story was so elaborated you had to understand nothing on your own.
the only message this movie conveys is ""men are helpless without women, women have superpowers, men are bad""
the main character is a flat character- she finishes exactly where she started with no character growth whatsoever.
the movie made me fell nothing but total disgust.
I advice disney to rewatch the good mulan and write down what made it good (hint, it has a story, character development, depth, deep symbolism and...well...we all think it so I might as well say it...FUN!)
the only 2 good things about this movie are the panorama and the Disney logo at the beginning.
this movie made a mockery of disney, of the story of mulan, of the fans of disney, and of the viewer's intelligence.

There's a lack of exposition at times that makes the directing seem lazy and the writing inept. Something about a Phoenix? A magic/chi system that has no explanation and no bearing on the story? Vague bad guy motivation? Yep, Mulan has it all! I get that Disney didn't want to make a carbon copy of the original, but this is a massive misfire.

My daughter loved the film and I enjoyed it too.It's a great family film with a simple story, visually stunning and a good pace. My daughter loved the action scenes and the fact that it depicted a women whose talents and energy meant she could outcompete the men.What I thought it lacked was some emotional depth between the key characters which could have made it a more exceptional film.

It's just the original story put into a clunky mess of script. What we wanted was something familiar. The timeless masterpiece you created back in the days of 2D Disney.

Talks probably too much about girls value trough the battle, who are not accepted in combat, but only to become housewives.
Actually I am a conservative man but still like girls with a strong attitude like this one, also she is very good fighting.
I feel probably many men are triggered about that.

Mulan goes through no character growth at all, which was supposed to be the entire point of the story. She's painted as this perfect character who can do no wrong and nothing inherently changes her. That's terrible story writing. There's also the ethics of filming this movie behind the scenes which makes it horrible and it's not even worth it because the movie sucks.

It does a great job honoring the Chinese culture and history while correcting some of the inaccuracies of the 'original' (the Huns were mainly in Europe).

HOWEVER, this is one of the most well done of the live action remakes. It's visually, stunning. The composers outdid themselves, you still get the melodic structure of ""Reflection"" and other songs from the animated film at key moments and the execution is done so well. The film is also action packed and entertaining. Don't expect the laughs you get in the animated film, go

I found the animated version very sophomoric, like you would expect in a film for kids. Eddie Murphy as a Dragon genie, funny, but nothing Chinese about it and rather insulting to the ancient Chinese culture. I think Disney made the smart, respectful choice by making the live-action version truer to the sense of ancient Chinese mythology while still preserving all the Disney family values. Most importantly, value for women. We rarely get to see women playing heroic roles, so as a father of a 16 month old girl, I can't wait to show her this incredible film when she's older and can understand it. What I can't understand right now is how anyone could hate this movie at all, perhaps they just don't get good cinema or culture in general?",Mulan

It's not a carbon copy (cut for cut crap like the lion king). Mulan was one of my favorite movies growing up, yes the music was fab and it was hilarious... but really I think generally it was b/c she was so brave and a badass.. and here we are, that's the same.

It IS a beautiful reimagining of the Mulan fable with loving nods to the original while standing completely on its own. This Mulan is artistically constructed, shot and acted. The costumes are fantastic, the photography is gorgeous, the action is exciting and the acting is superb. Allow that this is a fairy tale, not a Chinese history lesson, like some critics seem to think (although the care and research on the period is phenomenal), and you can appreciate what a very special piece of art this beautiful movie is.

2443,jmouse888,An Action-Drama lack of Both,4,9 September 2020,"As a native Chinese, the biggest issue I have is the bad writing. Many dialogs are poorly written culture-wise from both Western/American point of view or Asian/Chinese point of view. I can get past the predictable plot since it's a live-action remake, but the story is very inadequately executed and several plot-points are absurd and ridiculous. Many times I found myself asking -- ""Huh? Why would they do that!"" Moreover, even though it's marketed as an ""Action"" movie, the movie is also lacking any impressive action sequences which could have made it more entertaining. Battle scenes feel small, and many open-field sets feel confined and cramped. I was expecting LOTR or Avenger level battles but instead, I got a couple of dozen people doing some badly designed and executed martial arts in an enclosed movie set. Don't get me wrong, you have a group of very well trained martial arts actors (Donnie Yen, Jet Li, Jason Scott Lee), but feels like someone from a kungfu store in a strip-mall came up with the fighting sequences. Hell, The Matrix has better fighting scenes than this. Overall, the star-packed Mulan is an Action-Drama lack of both. What a shame!",Mulan

But no.Beside the actress, I think a lot of thing is wrong here. And with that big budget can't they afford a proper wuxia and Chinese culture consultant? The Chinese culture is butchered a lot here. Although the cast are Asian, it doesn't feel like Chinese. Good luck if they want to sell this in China.The director and producers should at least refers to some of the early Tsui Hark's wu xia filmography and enrich a bit about the wu xia culture through some Cin Yung's novel. Even the anime got it right better than this one.Mulan character and strength development progress doesn't feel continuous. And the sudden twist in the middle and the ending is confusing. Dialogues are very weak.It's very surprising. Disney has some excellent story telling capability and some of the best stories in animated why they real life always fall short?

Including nthe amount of work that went into choosing the lead role. This is definitely a REMAKE, not a shot for shot adaptation of the animation. I originally was upset like everyone else about the removal of Mushu but as I researched why. I discovered, what I loved about Disney, their attention to detail. They were able to remake a movie and hold true to cultural details that the western culture may not understand.

I love the original and liked the idea of a new take on the story that brought something different.However what I got was a lifeless film that hadn't really gone for realism and felt more like a clunky superhero story. The editing was so poor I felt like I was watching a student film, there was no character that really felt memorable and the entire message of the original film had been lost by giving Mulan superpowers from birth instead of us watching her learn and push herself.A lot of the big emotional moments from the original fall flat, and there's just no fun or heart left.

Somehow everything managed to become overly dramatic, while acting was non-existing. There was no Development to the characters. There's no music, which is funny considering that most Disney movies are musicals. They replaced the dragon with a Phoenix (why?!).This movie left me so icky and unsatisfied that I just went and watched the original Mulan immediately after.The only positive thing about this movie is the cinematography, and the fight scenes.

I found it very fascinating that someone had the gut to change some parts of the story, and to develop it in some more realistic ways.
A lot of essential characters where excluded but the core of the story is still the same.
I was taken by the production and the way this movie was directed. Very colourful, very catchy, and very fast.
Liu Yifei gave the character its right but I guess it would have been better if they kept Mulan's character as it was meant to, fun and enthusiastic.

But as a remake, and comparing it to the original makes it that much worse. The original Mulan is one of my favorite movies and I waited so long for this movie to come out and was incredibly excited. What a disappointment! They took out everything good from the original, all the amazing songs, witty humor, MUSHU, and even the plot and storyline. I'm fine with remakes not following the exact path of its predecessor, especially if they improve it, but this was a pretty much completely different story that is loosely based on the original. They breeze through parts that, in the original film, were main points for character development and building up momentum. Plus they introduce so much magic that it makes everything logical in the movie so useless.Is weird to say that the cartoon had better cinematography than the live action version? Not to mention better acting. That chilling part when the Huns charge and the soldiers come down the mountain by the thousands used to make my heart skip a beat. The war scenes in this film are just boring and overly choreographed. Mulan's flips and magical moves are really too much and it makes the war scenes kind of pointless. She was much more believable in the cartoon for the fact that, yes while she was a skilled fighter, she also used her brain and devised clever plans and tricks many times to overtake the enemy. She didn't just magically do flips and kick an arrow into the enemy's heart.With all that said - this movie is TERRIBLE and I do not recommend if you don't want to ruin your image of one of the best Disney movies",Mulan

By setting ridiculous prices for a variety of luxury products the sellers seek to establish a high value for an item with no basis in fact. The outrageousness of the price to view Mulan becomes the story, overshadowing any of the movie's actual merits. Don't misunderstand, Mulan is worth a look. Will you come away thinking, ""Oscar contender"", or ""Movie of the Year""? Doubtful. But while it does have its charms, it is mired in mediocrity with a predictable storyline, stereotypical characters, and borrowed martial arts and swordfight choreography from the likes of ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" who did it first and did it better. Under the period costumes and lavish sets, it is your typical ""underdog beats impossible odds"" movie. But credit where credit is due. No where did I see a caucasian, or non-Asian casting, so we have at least progressed from the days of Charlie Chan movies? I do tire of the commonality of the recent spate of movies with women characters tieing down their bosoms to pose as men.

There were some ok fighting scenes but lasted way too long. Damn! I want my money back,Mulan

2487,teganjaird,Bland & Lifeless,3,4 September 2020,"Mulan is a visual feast, and nothing more. It's a bland, lifeless mess of a film with watered down stakes, poor characters, no humour, and no heart. If anything, it's shown just how masterful the 1998 animation is.Mulan was just an ordinary girl, who went on to do extraordinary things, burdened by societal constrictions and driven by love, loyalty, and honour. But this version of Mulan is wooden and hollow. There is no weight to her decisions, no urgency, because she's the chosen one. And although Disney has proclaimed this to be an empowering film for women, applying the 'chosen one' archetype to the female lead (if you ask me) is a funny way of promoting female empowerment. If anything, it's disparaging, disheartening, and a huge step back compared to it's predecessor.",Mulan

2489,menkre,Mulan - An Emotional Story Of Resolved Issues,10,11 September 2020,"Mulan is an ancient Chinese story set in a magical colorful world where things get quirky as soon as the best characters come on the screen. All of the characters are memorable without feeling silly. The film is daring enough to make its demands clear. In a time of war there can only be commitment. There is no courage without fear. That is the theme on which the film presents its battles of will from. There is always a line you cannot or are not able to cross. The battle between the two protagonists always stays light which only better conveys subtly showing the perceived empathetic role of women in the society of that time.There is finally a movie that brings a lot of the most famous Chinese actors together in a passionate portrayal of battles that show no deceit. There is nothing sinister in the movie all but a simple victory for those on the right side of history.Even though the film might some to seem to some to be heavy on the main actress the film never forgets that there are others who matter too. A presentation of armies, its composition and their capabilities look believable and the strategies employed are never over the top.Anyways a great movie with great actors. A film with only positive messages all around but still enough meat to spark a conversation about interpersonal issues that any film about a society inevitably shows. Family friendly, hell yeah, and the fighting scenes are technically amazing and inspiring, Nobody should disengage anyone about seeing this movie.Thanks China. (Made In America) :)",Mulan

I think sometimes people become so entranced with a movie that when it is redone that people cannot accept the changes. Some times this is warranted as in the 1997 version of Twelve Angry Men, but sometimes I think it is the inability to move forward.

I expect the actors had a job to do to train for their action sequences. And the Crouching Tiger-Hidden Dragon style magic gave it an extra touch of mystery (so what if it's not reality?!)

2499,tatianamarisa_94,Not worth the price that Disney is asking,4,5 September 2020,"It is not worth the money Disney is asking.And I´m a Disney lover... Watch the animated version instead.
The sets and figurines were beautiful. There was really bad cgi and some good. The soundtrack was forgettable although there were references to the songs from the animated classic that I appreciated. I liked the fact that its a different story from the animated, unlike other Disney movies that copied the original and gave it a National Geographic twist(Lion king).But i would like to see a better growth on the main character ... Mulan´s already a incredible ""acrobat"" from the beginning of the movie. I would have like to see her SLOWLY discover how amazing of a fighter she is.
There were some but very few funny jokes and moments. The stunts and fight scenes were good I really did enjoy them...
In conclusion its far from being a great movie but i did enjoy it. Not worth the price that Disney is asking 30 something dollars is too much for the quality of this movie. I wont be watching the movie again.
Maybe if the main actress didn't support the violence that the Hong Kong police provided to its people i would enjoy the movie more ...

Kids outside China will love the 1998 version which was comical and fun. The China version is serious and boring but delivered Mulan's character more realistically.However, i like this 2020 version the best from Disney. I love the background scenery, exciting fighting, mesmerizing use of colors, great acting from YiFei and fantastic surround sound effects. 2 hours seems to past much very fast.

2505,slwoodside118,Completely misses the whole point of the story,1,21 October 2020,"This film is nothing like what was promised. It's not a more realistic version of the animated version and doesn't even hold to the values. The whole point of the ballad, and original film, is to show that while men and women have small differences they are both equal where it matters. The animated film manages this rather well as both Mulan and the male troop grow to become warriors together. In the new, 'more realistic', film Mulan is born with Chi, which is shown to be basically magic. This gives her an added advantage when it comes to fighting and so doesn't really promote the message that all women are equal to all men. It totally muddle the message. Then to add insult to injury they make her completely personality-less and give her no real drive of her own.
Mulan is meant to be an intelligent woman who uses her brain to overcome issues her physical abilities. This Mulan has none of that and makes stupid nonsensical decisions.
Overall just save your money and either watch the animated Disney version or one of the many Chinese films based on the ballad. This film is a shameless, directionless cash grab that doesn't have a clue what it wants to say. Worse yet, it's not even entertaining, you'll be frustrated with the character the whole way through.",Mulan

From cinematography to story, you will enjoy this very much. I know many people hate on it because it is not as their childhood movie Mulan, but grow the hell up.

For example, they way Mulan lost her father's sword...the pheonix literally does nothing...the witch sacrificing herself to save Mulan...the avalanche scene...poor character development...its like there is no natural flow .The movie is average nothing more nothing less. On the good side, i liked the soundtracks and music compositions. Its enjoyable in its on way. The fight scenes are excuted pretty well but need more polish.

The re telling of this story should not be compared to the animated original film. Having read some negative reviews, I did not know what to think before viewing. But I'm glad to say this made me feel happy to be a Disney and Mulan fan.
Unlike a carbon copy of Lion King, this re telling has heart and if you enjoyed Aladdin's joyous and colourful outfits and sets you will not be disappointed! The fantasy element had just the right balance and did go over the top.

Disney probably tried to get its Wonder Woman / Black Panther moment and they succeeded with an incredible Asian cast and female lead by a major studio in a tremendously anticipated film.

I love the first Mulan movie and in fact Mulan is one of my favorite Disney characters. I still sing songs from that movie to my children each night. But if I wanted to watch Mulan (1998), I would just watch the original.This movie is not meant to be a re-make, it is meant to be a re-imagining of a deeper story. A legend. A story about a woman who wants to be TRUE to herself but still respectful of her family, her culture, and her country. I think that the comedic relief of the Mushu character would have taken away from the important message that we can all stand to learn from this legend. Mulan learns that what she has within her is NOT something to be hidden away, but a gift that she can share with the world. I also thought the score of this movie was beautiful and the subtle references to the original brought tears to my eyes.If you want to watch Mulan (1998), then watch that movie and don't pay the $29.99 to watch this movie. But if you want to watch a movie with beautiful cinematography, music, and a story that any person across generations can learn something from, then I suggest you try this one.",Mulan

A few minor changes to make it historically accurate but most of the same characters from the original are there.

2532,rosescentedpaper,Appreciate it as a remake - then will you appreciate its beauty,7,13 September 2020,"I don't usually write reviews, but the avalanche of negative reviews which don't seem to understand nor appreciate the rationale of this remake prompts me to write one to address them.Firstly, this is a REMAKE, and I think those who go in expecting an exact replica of their dream cartoon has already started off on a wrong footing. As one reviewer puts it, the perfect Mushu has already been enshrined in the original cartoon - so why get upset when this reinterpreted the story without him?The purpose of remakes is usually to re-tell the story in a fresh, new way. Some remakes try to stay as faithful to the original plot as possible. Some veer off-course a little. This movie belongs to the latter, and while the necessity of some changes raise eyebrows, I think they have succeeded on certain accounts:1. Portraying the beauty of traditional Chinese values: if you appreciate this as a story set in very traditional and historic Chinese culture, you can see how this remake has made a beautiful attempt to capture the essence of deep values very important to traditional Chinese. Courage, loyalty, and truth - each are retold vividly through Mulan's (and her family's) story and struggle. Her inner struggle to stay True is particularly touching and real.Family ties and filial piety are also very strong values of the Chinese culture. The addition of a sister character is perhaps not as needless as many think, for Mulan's close relations with her sister substantiates the importance of her family to her. The wrapping up of the story with an additional virtue - piety - to Mulan's sword, also speaks volumes of this theme in the movie. 'Chi' is a very core element of Chinese Buddhism, and its addition shows a storyteller very in tune and faithful to highlight traditional Chinese culture. As is the the phoenix, an animal with as much significance as the dragon Chinese (a Mushu equivalent then?).2. Underlying moral themes: I have to admit the addition of the witch is a contentious topic that I have mixed feelings about. But if you see past the cliche magic and pay attention to the moral meaning this character brings out, that sheds light. Circumstances do not give you a right to act badly, and humans have a choice of how they act. The parallel circumstances between Mulan and the witch teaches the lesson of taking responsibility over our own actions - an important lesson especially in an age where so many are prone to react and blame circumstances around them, without considering how they themselves have a part to play and how they should account for their own actions.I have more to add, but I think these suffice to make the point that if one gets past expecting the same movie in form, one will find many treasures within this - not least a chance to appreciate deeply Chinese culture and values, beautiful stunts, and cinematography.",Mulan

First of all. This isn't Mulan the Disney movie. This is a movie inspired by Mulan. If you watch it on its own it is a fine movie. Not fantastic and certainly not bad. For some reason it has gotten a lot of hate. Maybe political, maybe fan based. The singing isn't there and mushu isn't either. But if you listen the songs are hidden in the movie. It still is however a story about coming of age and family honour. I think the movie is a solid 6. I gave it a 7 to level the reviews a little.",Mulan

I didn't understand why the witch used magic but Mulan didn't have her spirit guide, why even mention the spirits if they weren't gonna use them. And I feel like everything was too easy for her, she had no progress, they made her a naturally talented flying warrior. And they had a lot of long pauses with dramatic imagery and I felt they could have used those moments to actually add depth to the characters.

2562,jeburgeson-656-431175,Stop comparing it to the original cartoon.,8,7 December 2020,"I watched Mulan recently with low expectations, and my wife and I thought it was really good. We always try to keep our expectations low because most things do not measure up to the hype in our experiences. We watched it with a open mind and didn't expect it to be the cartoon version. It seemed more like a re-telling of the story and not a remake. Also, we could tell from the beginning that this was more of a drama than a comedy.All the negative reviews are pretty ridiculous to me. If you want to watch the original cartoon, go ahead and watch it. Who ever said that this was going to be exactly the same? People's expectations are so high for things like this and are often let down in a big way. I wish people would be more open minded and stop complaining about everything.If you are looking for a more adult retelling of the Mulan story, I think you will enjoy this movie. Was it life changing? No. Was it an entertaining movie? Yes. Decide for yourself and don't listen to all the complaining babies that didn't get their way.",Mulan

More of an homage to the original, it works really well as a standalone film. I wouldn't reach for this if I was with children - stick to the animation, but for older kids / teens, well worth the watch.The CGI was a bit off at points, the colour hyper-real, but this could also be due to the type of screen I watched this on. The costumes were amazing, and the attention to detail of these really detailed.Watch on a bigger screen to fully appreciate the scale.",Mulan

2566,pbbeicker,2 hours of my life stolen...,1,30 January 2021,"It is labeled as a reimagining of the original story, and I did find myself intrigued by the possibility of drawing from Chinese movies and culture of a more modern era; but I was not only disappointed by the lack of cultural respect of the stories origin, but also lack of respect of Kung Fu-movies and their heritage.The movies main character has no development, since she from the start of the movie is ""ready"", so to speak, in the sense that she already knows how to fight and is able to do all the things a man can do; this makes the movie have little to no progress, and it in stead of a reimagining tries to become an American attempt at a Kung Fu movie, with somewhat classical magic appearing as well. But even though there are a few good scenes that bare the hallmarks of direction from someone who knows Kung Fu, these scenes fall through as well, since the editing and rapid cuts through different camera angles shortchange the efforts made, and the viewer is left with a classic Hollywood-blockbuster cinematography instead, with many a slow motion sequence and bombastic music (and not even good music) to underscore.So to summarize: bad storytelling combined with a very short journey for the protagonist, bad editing, poor music and cheesy lines from ALL characters (some of which are downright nauseating) make this in to more of an attempt at making a movie focusing on gender equality and that ""women are just as good as men, if not better!"", than telling the actual story of Mulan.An even shorter description: how I was robbed of 2 hours of my life...",Mulan

We grew up watching the Disney Mulan (1998) and most probably majority of the people are expecting something like a Live Action version of the Mulan (1998). Expecting to have the songs (like other disney movie) in the movie, the singing and funny scene from mushu and stuff. But no, this is not a live action of Mulan (1998). I would say, it is its own version of MULAN movie with same plot story as Mulan (1998). If you watch it without high expectation from Mulan (1998), then this Mulan (2020) actually isnt half bad. It was great actually and I enjoyed it. However, as a Disney Movie (any disney movie), I think that they should have include the singing and songs in the movie and not just the music (and only part of it). Try watch it without expecting it to be a Mulan (1998) and you will enjoy it :)",Mulan

2580,britainvanderbush,Was it the best Disney remake yet? Was it worth it?,6,5 September 2020,"In live action Disney remakes, there is an over-saturated, too colorful to be realistic, quality to everything that makes each scene feel like you're walking into a candy store. I believe this is meant to appeal to children, reflect the colorful nature of the animated films, and provide a sense of happiness. It plays well during scenes of celebration, but if it were up to me I would prefer more natural color schemes rather than pushed saturation for the sake of simply being colorful. It seems to take some of the weight, quality, and sense of realism away from what we're watching. What it does for me is take the sense of danger out of the action sequences. When things aren't grounded enough in reality, the stakes don't feel high enough to make us really feel a sense of danger when we're supposed to. That said, within the confines that were likely provided by Disney in terms of violence, the fight scenes were pretty good, if not a bit too PG for a PG-13 film. Since they already had the PG-13 rating, I do wish they would have pushed the realism in terms of violence a bit more just to make us feel a sense of danger and worry for the characters. The general lack of that was made up for the few times we got to see Mulan do something like kick a spear into a man's chest, which was quite satisfying.Despite some of the dialogue being a bit cheesy and on the nose at times, I think they accomplished exactly what they were intending to, and made a pretty solid movie for their audience.It's not perfect, but it's very good.Was it worth the $30? Absolutely. Im underselling it in this post. A $30 ticket for a production this massive with so many good elements is nothing.What did they do well?
Most things. The sets, the props, the costumes, the scenery, the casting, the effects, the visuals, the music, the nostalgic elements and callbacks to the original film (which are ever present, yet not overdone or unfitting). There are more good things about this film than things worth judging. Niki Cari did a great job.Many people are saying this is the best Disney live-action remake yet, and I might have to agree. It's a toss up between Mulan and Cinderella.If you're a big Disney fan and you want something dazzling and adventurous to enjoy, or if you're just looking to kick back and watch something great for the whole family, this is it.EDIT: There is one outstanding weakness about Mulan (2020) that I didn't address yesterday when I wrote this review, and the more I think about it, the more I see it as problematic.
They took the concept of ""chi"" and used it as a force-like superpower in a way that I think hindered the film and story more than helped communicate the overall message.
Mulan is not an ordinary girl. In this story, she is much like a Luke Skywalker or Rey type character who is born with this special ability and power within her that she learns to harness throughout time. The story makes it clear that Mulan is not like everyone else. She is special. She personifies the ""chosen one"" storytelling trope (something that wasn't done in the original in which she was seen as a common, clumsy girl who simply stood for the right things and used her intellect, along with a bit of rebellion, to save China).
Giving Mulan these special powers and abilities took the message the movie should have told and turned it into something quite different, effectively saying that normal women can't do what men do. They have to be special.
Why can't we have more films of this caliber and budget simply feature strong female characters without having to give them superpowers in order to make them equal to the average man?
Overall, having given it more thought, I am changing my rating to a 6/10.",Mulan
2581,elli-chan-desu,I wish I could give 0 star to this movie,1,6 September 2020,"I am a huge fan of the animated version. When I heard that there's no music, no mushu and li shang, I was so angry, but still hope that they will create better version of Mulan. While watching it, I tried to enjoy and find good things on this movie but can't help to say these words too many times: ""why disney, why you ruin your own masterpiece"". ""Oh my God why"".The movie lacks of many aspects:
1. no heartful emotions between the characters (for example Mulan and his dad - lack of heartwarming father daughter moment; Mulan and her friends - they only mentioned the names but no memorable events with them, oh I missed their moments; Mulan and ""new"" Li Shang - LOL they replaced Li Shang with this guy but their relationship= Zero spark);
2. unnecessary new characters (and after finished watching I don't even remember who's who)
3. super horrible special effects (I can't believe it, again, ""why disney?"")
4. the battle was not grand and not memorable at all.
5. the actress is beautiful but no emotions stand out. I'm sorry but it was so plain and boring to watch her.
6. extreme shift key-point of the story.Such a terrible movie.It's just a standard plain martial arts movie, but they branded it as MULAN. Lol thanks a lot disney.Overall.

But for the first 20 I could definitely say that I had some preconceived assumptions about the movie. Once I accepted that this film wasn't going to be the animated film at all, I started to enjoy it. The usual, acting was good, cinematographry, so on and so on.My only two complaints. First, There was some pretty bad editing in the film and some camera 'fancy' camera work that I don't think was necessary.And second, basically giving her super human abilities to explain her fighting ability was pretty trash in my opinion. It just got rid of the concept that she could have achieved the greatness the eventually does through her persistence and hard work, something the animated film did wonderfully.How I would recommend this movie: 'if you go into it with a clear mind, and not judging it based on the animated film, I think you will enjoy it and have a good time.

The CG was not the best, the acting was not the best, and worst of all, adult Mulan lacked personality for most of the movie. The ancestor part was just kind of thrown in there, as if there had been more about the phoenix and then they cut it out, or they threw it in at the last minute. It didn't really tie into the movie very well. While I was able to do suspension of disbelief for some of the movie, there were a lot of parts that were just so far-fetched I couldn't overlook them. For example, why didn't hawk lady just kill the emperor when she was right there pretending to be a soldier. The fighting was very odd. The camera angles were jarring at times and the fighting style didn't seem consistent. Sometimes it was very much like pirates of the Caribbean and other times it was like a Kung Fu movie.

2590,japjap90,"disloyal, chicken and false?",6,4 September 2020,"It's not as bad as people say on here, and not as good as others say on here.
The fundamental problem with all these remakes of late is that they are remakes. it's pretty much a lose/lose situation. Great movies are passion projects that set out to be nothing other than what they are. Trying to 'live up' is an insurmountable detriment, especially when you're dealing with nostalgic sentiment as strong as Disney renaissance films hold.
You can just hear the pitch meetings while watching this. ''Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon meets Disney renaissance heartstrings''.
If I want to see CTHD, I'll watch CTHD. If I want to see Disney renaissance heartstrings, I'll watch one of my favorite classics for the seven hundredth time.
Disney, please stop underestimating and disrespecting your audience. We deserve better for sticking with you through all these years.
This was a fine watch, and honestly not all bad. I got the witch/scorned dog storyline and I think it's probably the best route you could have gone. But nobody is asking for not bad.
Here's one for you: have some of your own medicine and be loyal, brave and true. Make art, take chances, surprise us.

Most of these Disney movies have very childish story and the only thing that lets me watch through these is the songs.

2604,jorgiedianeeskew,I can't believe they ruined Mulan!,4,4 September 2020,"Mulan..the original Mulan was my favorite Disney movie growing up. Still is. The reason I loved it so much is because Mulan; a regular girl took her fathers place to save his life, even though she had a huge disadvantage. With no experience as a fighter, AND NO POWER, she went anyway because of bravery and honor and even though she struggled she still worked twice as hard as the men around her to become the best she could be. The fact that they felt that a woman had to have some sort of fighting power in order to outshine a bunch of men, saddens me greatly. I felt like she barely had to put in any effort at all. It ruined the movie for me comepletely. So I'm going to go pretend that the original Mulan movies are the ONLY Mulan movies and forget that this one was made. $30.00 wasted.",Mulan
2605,user-858-914979,Great live action remake of classic movie,10,4 September 2020,"The cast are great, the movie was shoot beautifully, and mostly follow the original storyline, and some adjustment to make it logical.Very enjoyable to watch, the lead actress is amazing for Mulan.The soundtrack is amazing, especially the two song performed by Christina Aguilera.",Mulan
2606,darkjedi14,Way better than the reviews,8,5 December 2020,"Ok, it's safe to say based on the countless negative reviews that if you loved the original, you are going to hate this movie. Totally fair, I get it. Like every Stars Wars fan who had their hearts crushed by The Force Awakens, it's horrible when expectations aren't met.That said, I've never seen the original, had zero expectations and loved this movie. First and foremost, watch it on the biggest 4k screen you can, not your phone! The epic scale is stunning, with rich colors, massive incredibly detailed sets and costumes, and open landscapes. In a time when most ""epic"" movies are shot in front of a green screen, this was a breath of fresh air. Huge props to director Niki Caro and cinematographer Mandy Walker for committing to old school movie making, the way it's supposed to be done.Second, it's shocking how quick everyone is to dismiss Yifei Liu. That's like telling Michael Jordan to go sit on the bench. She's giving heart felt performances in a non-native language all while riding horses, performing her own martial arts, weapons combat and stunts including wire work which is insanely difficult. The amount of training and work she put into this role is unreal and it's tragic that's going unrecognized. Hopefully she continues to land big roles because she's a superstar in the making.Was there room for improvement? Yes, tons. The tone felt off at times, the relationships were clunky and way underdeveloped, and the obnoxious flying Phoenix should be digitally removed as soon as possible. The ending left much to be desired, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Would love to see Disney give this the Mandalorian treatment and continue Mulan's story in a tv series. Having 10 episodes instead of 120 minutes would give the creators the time and space needed to enrich those characters and their relationships.Live action Mulan clearly missed the mark with the original fans, there's no getting around that. But as many have said, judge it for what it is, not what it is not. The cast and crew deserve much more credit for their monumental effort to produce a great film.",Mulan

2612,rachellesparkes1,What is with all these bad reviews!?,10,28 December 2020,I personally loved this movie. It's my favorite movie from Disney I have seen in a long time. Yes it totally went away from the original storyline of the animated film but it was made more realistic and relatable that way. It brought all the feels for me. The music and the fight scenes were also great. Would recommend to anyone! Already have.,Mulan

2614,paulphin,Ignore the low ratings and decide for yourself.,8,7 September 2020,"This is not a live action rehash of the animated Mulan. And, that's a good thing. The camera work is first class. You can see the textures of the fabric. The wilderness scenes are strikingly beautiful. Costumes are amazing. The lead role, beautifully played. The complaints that it's not ""Disney"" enough seem contrived. Rather than a cheap, martial arts knock-off, this feels more like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.The story line has special significance right now. It's good to see a film where honor is held in high esteem.My only real gripe is that the CG has that fake feel you get in any of the more recent Disney films. For example, Mulan rides her horse alongside some rabbits running in the grass. The poor quality is distracting.Enjoy the film for what it is rather than what you expected.",Mulan

2621,OffensivelyPC,Don't understand the hate this movie is getting,8,11 September 2020,"There was a lot to like about this movie, but I was surprised by the serious tone. I wouldn't call this a ""kids"" movie, though. Very little comic relief. It certainly took serious the female theme of living in a male dominated culture.You're likely familiar with the story, Mulan is the daughter of a former soldier. When they are attacked by the antagonist' army, each household must send one male from the family. Mulans father has an old war injury and will face certain death, but he is the only male in the household. So Mulan takes his place, impersonating a man and in the process, risks bringing dishonor to the family.I'll leave out spoilers, but one thing that was a bit disappointing was the absence of Mushu. They replace him with a Phoenix thats more symbolic than an actual character.The acting was good enough to not hinder the story telling and the cinematography was beautiful. I found the fighting sequences entertaining even if embellished the stereotypical tropes in ""kung fu"" type fighting movies a little bit.Don't let the bad reviews pursuade you. Wait until December and don't pay the $30 if you tend to judge live action movies against their animated counterparts. But this movie is good enough on its own. My wife, 6 year old and I liked it and we had zero expectations going in. Yet we were surprised at the low ratings and generally disagree with them.",Mulan

I don't mind the lack of singing, comedy, or romance. I liked the changes they made in Shang's character. Sorry but I really can't imagine a singing Mulan for this remake. This may not be the best but it is good enough. But I have to point out that the absence of 'I'll Make A Man Out Of You' had a huge impact.",Mulan

Charmless, devoid of emotion, and poorly acted this movie is a drag to watch. It tries to be two things at once and fails at both.

2636,astrotxcheng,Surprisingly strong movie that stands on its own,10,10 September 2020,"Given the past history of bringing animation classics to live-action has been a series of gits and misses. Mainly misses. Beauty and the Beast to me was better than expected and other attempts no so.However, Mulan is an exception to this trend. I do not see this new Mulan as a live-action version of the animated version, but a fresh new approach to this intriguing legend of woman warrior in a male-dominated society like China.My expectations for this movie was pretty low from what has been coming out of studios these days, but we were pleasantly surprised. It's central theme of devotion to family was very welcome in these times where families are being torn apart. This film has a very spiritual feeling to it.Film was well directed by Niki Caro and the acting was well done. Most of the top Asian actors were present including a cameo by original Mulan voice actor Ming-Na Wen. Yifei Liu did an admirable job playing Mulan. Her acting was subtle and yet she did very well in portraying a strong spirited woman.We were thoroughly engaged with this movie for its visual storytelling.

2646,reganculley,What annoyed me the most about this film,2,5 September 2020,"What annoyed me the most about this live action remake of Mulan (and there was a lot to choose from!) is the fact that in the original animated version Mulan was an ordinary girl, who was perceived at the time as extraordinary because she was 'a woman?!!!'. This live action remake has taken Mulan's training, ingenuity and bravery and made her 'special' through an abundance of magical Chi.
As a woman, who was a young girl when I watched the original, Mulan was the only Disney character that inspired me, this one depressed me. She was great, just as she was, and maybe the same goes for the original animated film.
Disappointing.",Mulan

So I was expecting to totally hate this one. But.... it's not terrible. It is absolutely beautiful to watch - the costumes and sets are amazing. The storyline is... decent. I am disappointed that the Mulan in this story has skill, unlike the original hero who had to work hard and use her brain to earn her place and conquer the bad guys. I prefer that role model. I'm also devastated that the songs from the original weren't included. However, if you watch it as it's own movie, not comparing it, it's pretty good. They could have put a bit more into character development, but overall, it's a good family action that encourages loyalty, courage and truth.",Mulan
2655,catty511,Can't believe all the hate,10,5 October 2020,"I've never seen the animation of Mulan or know much about the history of the story of Mulan. I have seen many Chinese battle, war and martial arts epics though. As a stand alone film I thought this was great. By far the best live action film Disney have made to date. I hated what Disney did to Star Wars, especially the explicit undermining of men and purposeful exaggeration of women's dominance, but Mulan got it spot on; it felt authentic and that's all I ever want. An authentic and captivating film is my judgement; possibly because I am naive to the history, but this is an entertainment industry. I was entertained.",Mulan
2656,jon-digm,Sophisticated Family Movie,9,5 September 2020,"It's great to see a family movie with this much artistry. The cinematography is beautiful. The use of symmetry and stylized, clutter free shot design ads a disciplined framework around the characters who play out a story about heart, courage, and family. The story adaptation should be counted as it's own achievement, not as an insult to the animated release. I personally love the affirmation of a father's love along Mulan's journey from her own father, through the regiment commander, and up to the emperor.
Add all this to the locations, sets, costumes and wicked cool fight choreography, and you've got an entertaining and emotional film. One star knocked off because my sons miss the song and dance routines. :-)",Mulan

2664,sheryl_tsz,It doesn't have to be like the original,8,7 September 2020,"Unfair low rating from those who had expectations of it to be more like the original animated Mulan just because it's made by Disney. If you watch it from a fresh set of eyes / with no expectations, it would be a great movie as a live action film in telling the story.
Although, I must admit, it did feel quite rushed with some screen time given to the villains lore, but overall distributed.
Another point to note is that Disney is making it more realistic / different as they wanted to portray a version different from the animated classic. If everything were like the originals, there would be no point in remaking it action for action like a mirror, might as well watch the classic itself. As reference to Will Smith as Genie in Aladdin, he had some huge Robin William shoes to fill but he took a different approach as not wanting to be like the original Genie but added his own style. That's what we need for Disney to be more creative and advance further to bring us more stories we love. Just to name a few - Frozen, Pocahontas - stories that wouldn't be the same one we all came to know and love if they had based it on the actual stories they made the movies from.
So yes, it doesn't have to be like the original, if you want the original, watch the classic, don't bash it out on the life action film because it's not meant to be like the classic with its serious scenes of war and fear of being exposed.",Mulan

Characters lack depth (e.g. Mulan's sister, troop ""friends""). Villains - unconvincing, NPC-like, similar to imperial guards.
Character development lacking: Mentions of ""chi"" almost like a superhero-like power. Effort, teamwork and kindness, is thrown out the window. Mulan is a warrior born flexible, active, and able to defy gravity.
Final thoughts: Disappointing and messy. I often felt befuddled, wondering what the whole intention of the movie was. Feminism, equality? Loyalty? Honesty? Honor? Too touch-and-go, and vague.",Mulan

2674,uramoss,Enjoyable. Much better than I expected,9,6 September 2020,"Of all Disney's live actions I'm glad they did a retelling that was, if slightly, more true to Chinese mythos.
If taken as its on story (as you must like with the Harry Potter films and other retellings) this movie is excellent.
The storyline could have been a little longer and it does feel like a little was skipped over (lots of cuts from the film I'm sure to bring its length down) but it still conveys the story in the emotional and passionate manner I've come to expect of some of Disney's greats.
I'd do a more in-depth review but alas I tend to ramble. So...
I'd rather have a different telling in a ""re-make"" than the same telling performed in a different manner or on a different canvas. So like all opinions, mine is biased to my own perspectives.

2675,adeeb-hamad,I borrowed my friends Disney credentials to watch this and I still want my money back.,2,8 January 2021,"Disney felt the need to hire a woman to direct the movie just because they wanted to be more progressive in the wake of the 'me too' movement. Too bad the lady did the complete opposite of what she set out to do. Instead of giving the viewer a courageous young women who respects her culture but has to decide between her family and her culture she gives us a wild brat of a child that has superpowers, which there is no issues with her being a woman. Nobody in the story ever mentions anything about being a woman. Everyone has an issue about her having the superpowers. Which who out of the audience is going to connect with that??? Nobody. Anyways, they also give us another villain who has no role in the story other than being another woman with superpowers. Oh, and I can't forget these superpowers come in real handy when training with all the men. I can't help thinking though, that it's much more dramatic when a woman with normal woman physical abilities struggles to keep up with men's physical training and through sheer determination she manages not just to keep up, but bests all the men. All to save her father. Not to mention in this movie it's her superpowers she uses to prove herself at camp vs in the cartoon where she uses her brain by solving a challenge no man could solve right. I mean this movie fails on every single layer. There is not one aspect of this movie done right. Not one thing can be said about this movie that improves upon the original release. There aren't even any memorable scenes.Furthermore! Mulan falls in love with the first man that makes eye contact with her lmao. They literally share maybe a quarter of a conversation throughout the whole movie.Regardless it was the worst case of 'men writing women' I have ever seen in my live and IT WAS DIRECTED BY A WOMAN.NOT TO MENTION MUSHU WAS CUTI would never take my daughter to watch this movie. It was such a stupid waist of time. Even the whole plot was lost when they added the new villain and her superhero into.The only way this movie could have been any worse is if she had used her 'chi' and went super Saiyan at the end, but at least that would have been cool to look at.",Mulan

What's good: the casting, blending new and appealing young actors with well-invested veterans. The rich look and production. What's ok: the story; there are no surprises, but it remains a good yarn with a moral center; and the action: I don't think it will make viewers rewind to see it again, but you're alert. What's bad: not a lot of laughs, and even some lugubrious scenes that need not have been so serious, especially those overdoing the ""shame to your family"" thread.",Mulan

I love that they explored more on Mulan's childhood, her activeness as a child & the relationship with her father. And I can totally see why Disney doesn't include any songs.

2685,wangbin1518-237-182440,An Insult of Culture and Shame,3,14 September 2020,"""Do you believe they are actually picking a Chinese girl to play the role as Mulan in the new real-person Disney remake movie?""
I can still remember the question from an ABC girl and the excitement on her face when she was asking the question back in 2017. And after all these years of waiting, it turns out to be a complete disappointment.A 3-star is probably the best rating that I can give here.
Yifei Liu is absolutely the ideal cast for the character of Mulan. It looks astonishing on that reflection of Mulan in the sword poster. And that wins the movie one of the stars.
Some of the scenery in the movie are beautiful especially with IMAX 3D. Mountains and skyline of the capital city are breathtaking, which earns the second star. It is probably a half star if not with IMAX.
As for the third, since IMDB won't allow me to give a ZERO star for the worst movie of all time, it is basically a buy-2-and-get-1-for-free star.Mulan's story has been told to all the Chinese of their childhood for over a thousand years. And thanks for Disney, the story is told to all the world with their great cartoon movie in 1998. The spirit of Mulan has been encouraging generations of people, including her bravery, loyalty and most importantly her filial responsibility. (Well, that's true, Chinese people thinks highly of their filial duty.)
However, all the spirits above are but of words engraved on the sword, and the director really wants to tell that little story about a girl seeking for her true-self, which could be any other story but Mulan's. Despite of that, the whole story line is not logical, well, at all.
* Avoiding to face the true-self as a female? Is that true?
* Hiding family Kungfu from the troop? Is that necessary?
* Taking off all armor and helmet to run for a war fight? Cannot be more logical.
* A troop of well trained soldiers counting the Emperor's life on and only on a little girl? Best strategy ever.
* Such an easily provoked Emperor that would rather get himself into a one on one fight to a berserker? Trump wouldn't do that for sure.If you want to make a good Chinese history based movie, the least thing you have to do is to do some real study on it.
But all I can see from this movie is prejudice from westerners to Chinese traditional culture and a soulless Disney drama.
* Praying to phoenix for safety and peace? We don't ever do that in China.
* Concubines with pale white faces and bloody red cheek makeups? That's what Japanese Geishas do.
* A mind-controlling or transforming witch? Okay, Valar Morghulis.
* Phoenix Vs Eagle metaphor? What's that for?
Basically, not a single culture is presented precisely from where they come in this movie.
If you can read Chinese, you can learn more mistakes that are made about the culture, history timelines, etc, where the ratings goes all the way down to 4.9 after 3 days of the release.
If you can't, don't bother, and just remember the mistakes are much more than you can even imagine.
The director successfully made a contribution to alienate the understanding between the westerners and Chinese.
Westerners may think this another movie that is made for Chinese in order to please the Chinese market, while Chinese people are actually feeling INSULTED by all these cultural bias.
Niki Caro shows us a great example how to make a movie and offend both side of the audience.In the original Mulan folklore, there are no characters like Mushu, the cricket, and all the funny souls of ancestors. But who would possibly complain about a cute funny dragon especially when it comes from Disney? But when a silent, helpless and do-not-know-what-to-do phoenix is taking Mushu's place, it just let people doubt if this 2020 remake is actually a Disney movie.
Besides, Mulan is made a superhero with great talent when she was very young. And of course, a heroine cannot have a boyfriend, potential one, as a general or something. That adaption sounds not feminist at all.All in all, this movie is simply a waste of a good legend, passion from Disney fans, 2 hours of your life probably, and above all, 200 million dollars.
Good job Niki Caro!",Mulan

2692,buptnsy,the story can be told better,9,6 September 2020,"There are some parts of the story can be told better, such as why the witch would die for Mulan; why the match maker made a soft scream when Mulan was rewarded in the end; why Mulan would voluntarily expose her gender in front of other soldiers, in the animated version she fainted because of injury, then was found out while curing, which would make more sense.As a Chinese I felt very misleading was the concept of 'Chi'. It made the success of Mulan Due to her super power which changed the whole core of the story.Overall I think this movie will be liked by kids. Adults will find the story obviously not making sense in a few places.Yet I still gave this movie 9 stars for this movie is nicely made and it would create some laughter during this pandemic.Something I didn't expect, yesterday I watched this movie with some US friends, and today we watched the 1998 animated Mulan movie.

2701,marwinlopez,A Good attempt by Disney. Not bad but flawed.,10,7 September 2020,"I gave the movie a 10/10, because I don't think it deserves a low rating from others. But My rating of it is 8/10. It's a good movie, it's different from the animated classic that's why I liked it. A lot of people are saying that they hate it for changing so much. That's the reason for the remake. I don't want another movie where the scenes and also how we knew Mulan is the same as the animated movie. The story is the same but there are added parts that I really like and I think was really interesting. Although I agree that it's kinda like star wars where the chi is the force. That's okay, it gives more chinese culture to it. That doesn't mean she's not using her intelligence and determination. She is still using it, but the chi helps her to be more stronger. It is still a fantasy, but for me it's good. I'm not degrading women, but women are often not as strong as men so it would be very weird if she's really that strong than other men. Even if she was trained when she was a child or training by herself alone she maybe strong but not as stronger as a men. So that's why it made sense adding the chi. The story is really good. But I wished when training the ""I'll make the man out of you"" music is better and nostalgic. It's okay for the movie to not be musical but on scenes like that at least the musical score of the animated songs would be great! They added the music when she was preparing for the matchmaking but did not added the ""I'll make the man out of you"" score. And also there are some scenes that a little gappy. Like when she encountered the witch, and when she went back to the war, I think they should add more scenes of how did she got there and also when she was shooting arrows at the enemy behind them, how did she got there?Mulan is it's own movie. I really liked it but still it's not perfect. For those who are comparing it too much from the animated classic I disagree with them. I watched other reviews saying that they got bored? At the beginning I never got bored. I was very entertained while observing the movie. I can see it's pros and cons. But I don't think it's a bad movie. I was not disappointed. The only disappointment for me was Beauty and the Beast and I watched it on cinemas. THAT I fell asleep and it's because it's the same, scene by scene for most of the part.Watch it and if you don't like it. That's okay. We all have our own preferences. I like both They are the same but different. A beautiful remake that gave justice to the original.But still I'm hoping for an extended version of the movie when released in blu ray. I don't care how long. The 2hrs was still not enough for me.",Mulan

That's what Mulan shows us, a women with talent, one used it for good and one for bad. And we see the outcomes but mulan exceeded all expectations!Watch it with an open mind!",Mulan
2703,jeppespedtsberg,This should not even be associated with Mulan or Disney - a horrible attempt at a movie,3,5 September 2020,"Overall, from a general movie standpoint, it is just bad. Incredibly bad acting, weak character arches, limited emotion, bad CGI, confused cinematography.... The list goes on. If anything, this seems like an equal, if not slightly worse, version of ""The Great Wall (2016)"".Besides these factors making it a bad movie in its own right, to make matters worse it has nothing to do with a Disney movie - at least they managed to remove everything that is usually associated with that franchise.1) There are no witty characters (like Mushu) that usually is integral to balance the deep emotions of Disney pictures2) There is NO SONGS, as in none. In other words, one of the clearest pillars of what makes Disney movies great was removed. This is especially egregious when considering the amazing song options in ""Reflection"" and ""I'll Make A Man Out of You"" that was available and defined the previous 98' movie.3) Instead of replacing the void of Mushu or Li Shang, they introduced new characters in the form of a witch, Xian Lang, that is a confused mix of an antagonist and a savior meant to help Mulan develop her ""abilities"". When push comes to shove, she ends up being absolutely redundant and an unnecessary addition that could have done much better by merely adapting the original characters.In sum, this is most likely the worst attempt ever of producing a good remake, or even just a movie, from the Disney studios and I hope they will be both greatly disappointed and change their approach for future. Further, I hope this will not be remembered or even associated with neither Mulan nor Disney - it is simply that bad.",Mulan

We had high hopes and many reviews put this film in the negative. I know there are many political and other issues at play and if you don't agree with those issues or actions that is fair. If you don't want to support the film and what you think it stands for all to you. I don't think the negative reviews rang true in our instance as the actors/actresses were really good. There's a level of maturity that was needed for the actors in their roles. The story was heartfelt and the women and girls in the room felt empowered. Each scene was beautiful and the story powerful.Sacrifice, family, courage, staying true, loyalty, bravery, and honor. Fa Mulan is a story of the ages and this version is one we could watch again and again. I feel sorry for the controversies. Watch the film for what it is and you will enjoy it.It was good to see Asian representation in the movie. It's got a coherent storyline and the characters get all a great plot.

I liked the more serious tone and the lack of the stupid love story, it was hinted that there might be something between the two but it didn't shove it in your face. The more serious tone also made the stakes more interesting and important, made it feel that there is a chance there might not be a happy ending. At time the dialogue did feel disjointed and a bit odd but I can get past that, it was still really fun to watch.Also really glad there were no music numbers or Mushu.

Not bad different. I heard and read negative comments about this film because there isn't a singing and there wasn't any Mushu. At first, I decided not watch it because of the things I read. Once it became available on Disney + and was available to watch for free, I wanted to give it a chance. I was really surprised on how well they film turned out.I gave it an 8 because even though there wasn't any singing and there wasn't Mushu, the film actually wasn't that bad. I love how they portrayed Mulan as a Independent and strong women. Especially in those times, where women weren't seen as equals and were inferior to men. This movie is a lot more serious then the original. The original is more Disney friendly (of course because it's Disney), singing, laughing. This one is more serious, no singing, leaning more towards adults then children. Growing up in the early 90's and watching all the animated versions and now Disney is coming out with Live Action versions ... really isn't appealing to even watch these films but this one wasn't to bad, in my opinion.All I say is give it a chance. Really watch it and listen to the film. Even though it's Disney, remember that it's more the focus on her and what she is accomplishing as a woman in those times without all the singing lol",Mulan

I really enjoyed the movie, and absolutely recommend it!
Please don't decide not to watch the movie because of these reviews. I think you should watch it, and then decide for yourself. Even if some people don't like it (which is natural, of course, everyone has different taste), I think giving this movie one star, is not justified.",Mulan

This one was by far the worst and the most cringe-worthy.Creative twists are welcome in remakes, whether it's eliminating characters, changing villains, and taking a different take on what truly makes someone a good warrior. However, many of the creative differences that were written for Mulan were odd and sometimes very unwarranted.Beyond changing a lot of story line- which is fine if you look at it as a different movie than the animated version- the fight sequences were absolutely atrocious and cringe-worthy, and directed terribly.I enjoyed the casting, and small scenes that alluded to the animated version.

It is a more mature take on the story and the actors and director did an outstanding job at conveying alot of the subtlety of Chinese culture.

Just because I don't fit into a certain expected category doesn't mean I should!It taught me a father-daughter relationship is at its best when the father loves and is honored by his daughter no matter what society or traditions dictate.What is this movie trying to teach? You should be born gifted in order to break out of the certain mold you're expected to fit in? We have duty to the system..? Women can be masculine and man up and compete with men?

I loved the original and was so impressed by Aladdin i went out and borrowed a projector to finally watch this one.As visually entertaining as it was, the movie lost most of it's soul. This to me happened in most parts by eliminating lovable characters like mushu, taking magical moments out by eliminating music and trying to make everything a bit more realistic (which is just ridiculous considering running up and down walls and the phoenix etc)The movie looks and feels more like an eastern production than a disney flick and while not being the blandest movie ever it just isn't what you are looking for when you go for a remake of an old movie with expectations aimed towards recreating that experience.So sad...",Mulan

2748,domsilva-88023,Simply a bad movie.,1,7 September 2020,"This film takes a perpetual downturn from the very beginning after it's stated that Mulan has an excess of 'chi' and is not just a quirky, clumsy, funny girl that is also brave, courageous, and earns her skill through perseverance and training. I understand the remake is meant to be different, but if they see making women protagonists unrelatable as different then this movie borders on frustrating.
The Good
Sometimes the score plays notes from the 1998 versionThere were 1-2 funny momentsMulan's stored energy/chi/force-like action scenes were pretty badass (only reason for 1 star)End creditsThe Bad
Sometimes the score only plays notes from the 1998 version; need more as Mulan (1998) arguably has the best Disney soundtrack of all timeThere were only 1-2 funny moments; almost zero comedic reliefWill constantly find ways to pull you out of it and suspend reality with obviously bad/implanted CGI and jump cutsBad actingBad editingBad screenplayBad directingOverall, you will come away from this feeling like it's a massive money grab from Disney and will have soured the taste of Mulan to all fans of the 1998 version.

From the beginning , I was hoping it would be different from the animated version and most of the complaints are that it is so different but it is a live action interpretation and I think everyone should approach it with fresh eyes. It's obvious they put a lot of time and effort into the costumes and the fight scenes and I think they did a beautiful job . My advice to viewers out there, give it a chance!

2763,gabodiford,Really Just the Name,4,26 December 2020,"To ME, for what the movie was in itself, it wasn't bad. Yes, I am mad and hurt that it wasn't a carbon copy like the original. I wanted to see a CGI Mushu and Cricket. I wanted to see the animated world of Mulan become this real world scene like they did with the Lion King. (If I'm not mistaken the Lion King didn't have that many differences from the original or was most similar to the original, I could be wrong!) But the thing that gets ME the most is that they named it Mulan. Yes, her name is Mulan. Yes, she still takes her dad's position to fight. Yes, she still fights an evil force. However, like I said to ME, they named it Mulan. This story is obviously a different portrayal from the original. It has some similarities but not that many. And for that reason I feel like this story should have been named different. They did this story/movie wrong by naming it Mulan. People will most likely compare it to the original. Hell I do. The name to ME makes it feel like it should have been the original storyline. They could have tried a title with something Mulan and not just Mulan. But thats just my opinion, and yes I do still compare and complain at times.Watch the movie for yourself and then make your own opinion/assumption. I could go both ways and tell you it sucks because it doesn't mimick the original, or I could tell you it was amazing. It feels like these are two different stories that tell great lessons, but will most likely always be compared because they have the same name.I do want to note that the movie looks great and the acting I think was great. My gripe isn't with the quality of what the movie looks like or the actors.",Mulan

2766,dlanderson-57347,"Great to look at, but not much beyond that",5,10 September 2020,"This movie had the opportunity to be so good, but it just wasn't. The one thing that this movie has going for it is that it looks very good. There is some really great scenery in this movie, and the costumes looked pretty good. Other than that, this movie doesn't have much more going for it. The three main problems I have with this movie are: lack of a character arc for Mulan, lack of a compelling villain(s), and contradictions within the film. First off, our protagonist Mulan doesn't really grow as a person during the movie. She does make the decision to stop hiding who she is, but that's not really an investing story. From the beginning we see that Mulan is incredibly gifted, and that the only reason she can't show off her talents is because she's a girl. Her main conflict is deciding whether or not to show it. That simply is not relatable. If we got to see her grow and develop her skills, like in the animated movie, that would be a lot better. Second, the villains in this movie are not compelling. To me, this seems like the writers couldn't figure out who was the main villain. We have Bori Khan, the leader of the Rouran army, and a female witch named Xian Lang. They are mostly working together, but they don't spend much time together onscreen. This means that neither of them really stands out. In my opinion, if Bori Khan was the only villain, this would have been a much better story, and he could have been a compelling character. It would have been more like the animated version, but Shan Yu was actually quite menacing. And third, the movie contradicts itself. This movie is very different from the animated film in tone. This version decided to cut out the dragon Mushu, the comedy, and the musical numbers in order to be more realistic. I think that wasn't in itself a bad idea, and could have worked out nicely, if they had developed the characters better. However, during the movie we see people running up walls that are easily 25 feet tall, swinging curtains as deadly weapons, having people catch and kick arrows, and magic. That definitely took away the sense of realism that they were going for.
In short, this movie could have been really good, but it just wasn't. Some people may find it entertaining, but the lack of story compromised it for me.",Mulan

2769,raynaudolivier,A nice Disney live action movie,6,6 September 2020,"This Disney is not a musical and I think it's for the best. Aesthetically beautiful, this version of Mulan tries to make something different than the other live action movies from the Mickey Mouse company. It works most of the time even though we can deplore that the movie is too smooth and ""easy"" to create real strong emotions. But it's a Disney and it's a different world. Whether you like it or not, that's the way it is ;)",Mulan
2770,tftkm,Had higher expectations,4,5 September 2020,"I was quite disappointed by the movie, considering I expected a lot more fun, spontaneous tenderness and more realistic acting. Throughout its duration, my feelings/ interest on intensity gamut in a scale 1- 10 did not exceed (with the exception of lady hawk's last scene) the 3-4 score. It was totally flat! You feel no depth in the characters, you do not connect to them in any level. The main actress is pretty, but she carries something very American-like in her manner, and gives the impression of being disconnected to the true depth of Chinese culture. The bows, the greetings etc. are far more shallow than they should be. Considering the era and that it's a woman meeting the emperor, she should not even dare to face him, and certainly not speak for so long in the end. People back then had numerous etiquette rules to avoid being disrespectful and to honour the person they interacted with, ESPECIALLY when talking to their superior. Chinese and Japanese cultures have held their values incredibly high throughout the centuries, they are a very crucial part of their culture and personal identity. In the movie I do not see Mulan bow to her father or showing the deep respect he is entitled to. Her sister is way too expressive, considering her screams and enthusiasm. In most Asian cultures, expressing negative emotions was considered very rude and unpolite, and women learned from a young age to act with silence, respect, and humility, moving slowly and gracefully, being seen but not heard. Ok, it's a Disney film, I get that, but it's supposed (according to the directors) to be true to Chinese culture, which it didn't manage to do very well. I liked the costumes and rich colours very much, and the fact that their haircuts resembled a bit the cartoon's. I also appreciated the fact they honoured the subject and hired Chinese actors and not Korean or other. Finally, I must say I would've preferred the directors to have changed the language to Chinese (since they all spoke it) to make it more historically accurate or, if that wasn't possible, to at least have used an older way of speaking in English, (e.g. Thus, thy, and that kind of style) to portray the movie in a past time. If you haven't seen the movie yet, I would advise you to see it just to form an opinion by yourself, but don't make it a priority. The cartoon was way more fascinating.",Mulan

2772,fqueirozf,Not a 1. Not a 10 either.,6,8 September 2020,"Really. People these days really need to start thinking for themselves. This is not a live action remake of the 90's animation. And that's all what I am going to say about reviews bringing that up as argument.
That said, the movie has its good moments, but some blatant flaws as well.The movie is based to the original material, yeah the legend novel. Mulan IS a kind of a Chi chosen one in the legend tale, ok?But Mulan also shows her intelligence in a strong scene where she uses her pure wits to win a battle and save the most part of her regiment. There are also emotional moments and a strong message that permeates the story throughout the movie. However it is all done in a pace that does not seem natural. Strong scenes cut to a dozens of seconds, no time to develop the majority of characters to make a real connection to them and even to remember their names. Some flashback scenes of the so called ""last great battle"" would greatly improve the the antagonist weight.And last, but not least, the whole magic question. To strip it of Mushu and Cricket and the songs was a smart move to make it more a drama and not mock on the legend. But to make it up with a shapeshifting, doppelganger witch to fulfill the role was really a valid choice? In my, opinion, no. And her cheap and foolish death is the best proof of that. She is completely expandable to the story.
I would give it a 7 but, personally, I was only aware Donnie Yen and Jet Li were in the movie when the credits rolled up. And not because of the characterizations, but, again, for the lack of development.",Mulan

That, for me, has been the problems with so many of the remakes recently - I want to see another interpretation of stories I have grown to love.This film, as far as I am concerned, is on another level entirely to the 1998 classic - with shades of that film in set-pieces and musical highlights.Over all I found it be an imaginative, epic retelling of an ancient story. There were moments that simply took my breath away.Well worth a watch.",Mulan

2805,MomoM121,Just plain and lifeless,1,13 September 2020,"I didn't expect a copy of the animated film, I think it would be interesting if they took a different path to tell the story in a realistic way. The idea of removing Mushu, the ancestors, the cricket and the musical scenes was good, because it worked perfectly on an animated film but in a live action it wouldn't... but then they contradicted themselves by inserting some fantasy elements that just felt ridiculous. You can't connect with the story.I could point so many things that went terribly wrong, but I'll just mention two:1. They spent $200,000,000 on this film. $200,000,000! I recognize some elements of production design, photography and costume design were good. But come on, why did they made the combat scene at the snow mountain so lame? They had a $200,000,000 budget! I wonder where did they spend all that money because I don't really see it in the movie.2. The forced feminism. They want to show they care about this social issue but I don't understand why this vain effort in doing so. (I don't consider myself a feminist nor against feminism.)The original Mulan was already feminist. It showed how being a woman didn't stop Mulan from saving his family and, by consequence, her country. She was an ordinary woman that wanted to honor her family by following their traditions and getting married as they wanted, but when they ask his father to join the army she knows he is too old for that and is surely going to die on war. So she, for no other reason but love for her family and a wish to honor them despite failing in being a good woman, decides to sacrifice herself and go to war instead of her father. We see how she commits in being a good soldier, fails many times and yet she doesn't give up until she succeeds. They discover she is a woman because in the combat scene at the snow mountain she gets hurt while risking her life to save everyone and when they cure her they discover the truth. Even after they reject her, she insist and follows them to protect the emperor, they follow her because she becomes a leader and wether they accept her or not, she is still going to risk her life doing everything she can to save the emperor. She knows her limitations, she is not strong and because of that she uses her intelligence instead.
In this film the message is clear: It doesn't matter who you are, you can achieve anything if you trust yourself and work very hard for it.But on this new film, well... she is special, she has the power of ""Chi"". She doesn't even bother in being better. Why would she? She is so powerful and special just because the script says so. There is no development. She never does anything to win her comrades trust and respect. She reveals herself being a woman because she has to stop hiding who she really is, she must show the whole world how special she is. They reject her, but next scene she is back and suddenly everyone are all like ""Oh Mulan, you are the one that must protect the emperor because we just realized how special you are."" ""I am captain of this army and have years of experience but it doesn't matter, I trust your Chi, so please, lead us and save the emperor, you are our only hope."" This is just lame and extremely forced.
In this film the message is also clear: You can do anything but only if you are ""special"", otherwise don't even bother trying.",Mulan
2806,pavel-23010,Mulan,9,7 September 2020,"I think it was a very beautiful and very detailed film, do not want to compare it to the cartoon of the nineties but as a film in itself. The whole atmosphere of the film was great even though it could not be seen in the cinema. I loved the game of the two famous actors Donnie Yen and Jet Li.

Don't get me wrong, J grew up with that movie and I love it! But it is an Americanized version of a classic Chinese ballad. This movie falls a lot closer (not exactly) to the traditional version, and it's still appealing to American audiences. As long as you're not expecting a shot-for-shot remake, this is a great story! It maintains the Disney feel while still telling an old tale. My main issue with it is the transition from scene to scene was pretty abrupt. Overall though, I thoroughly enjoyed it!",Mulan

I almost didn't finish the movie because it was so boring and confusing.NOT worth the $30!",Mulan
2813,poimen-09944,Fantastic movie,10,9 January 2021,"I just watched this with my wife and I don't understand why so many people have been critical about this film. We thought it was fantastic and clean. It definitely displayed violence, but PG13 is a proper rating. This movie displays courage, family values and honor to its audience. I felt like the majority of the actors were fantastic, especially the role of Mulan.
If you haven't watched this with your family yet, don't take favor to the negative reviews, you'll end up missing out on a great movie.",Mulan
2814,jaken-56179,You NEED to watch this impeccable film,10,5 September 2020,"This adaptation of Mulan is more faithful to the original Chinese legend of Hua Mulan which separates it from the animated Disney film. This version of Mulan does NOT have Mushu, but he is not missed due to the more serious tone of the film. Also missing are the classic songs. The extraordinary scoring of the film makes up for the loss of musical numbers by playing instrumentals of the classic songs throughout the movie. Beautiful imagery, epic action scenes, and impeccable camera work create a film that is pure ART. Saying this film is empowering would be an understatement. The story of Hua Mulan has been hugely inspiring to many women, but it even brought me (a male) close to tears. Her journey is truly inspiring and shows the beauty, power, and grace of a woman. This is NOT the movie you grew up with as a kid, but there are SO many new and improved elements that make it more suited to an adult viewer. Some of the story is slightly different from the animated film which brings new and exciting twists. PLEASE watch this film. As long as you are open to a newer version of Mulan, you will be blown away. This film COMPLETELY surpassed all of my expectations, so I implore you to give it a chance!",Mulan

The lead actress is dry and I could not connect with her or the story. The village looks nothing like anything in China, the battle scene makes no sense (no1 saw Mulan save them but somehow they all just listen to her? Yer right..) I can't believe so much money was spent making this, even more that I paid extra for my subscription for this.",Mulan
2817,phoebeancaluong,Beautiful movie that stayed true to the Chinese legend,10,4 September 2020,"This movie was brilliantly produced. The choreography of the fight scenes, the story line and by staying true to the original Chinese legend, it's a beautiful masterpiece. Using a full Chinese cast with experience in kung-fu truly makes the film more special. Liu Yu Fei in particular is outstanding.",Mulan
2818,aahmedjjamal,Nice Entertaining Movie,9,6 September 2020,After reading all the comments I thought it would be a disaster of a movie but then i thought OK let me give it a go as it is Disney's film and to my surprise I really enjoyed it. I didn't see the animated one so can't really judge and compare. Its a must watch!!!! Ignore all the Negative Comments don't know what they wanted lol,Mulan
2819,snatvipada,One of the worst big budget movies I've ever seen.,1,6 September 2020,"Honestly such a waste to see such an amazing cast and scenery put into this disaster of a movie. If this movie didn't have Mulan as the title, everyone would just see it as a generic Chinese movie. While the cinematography was nice and the acting was good the story was a complete mess. They made a 2 hour movie feel completely rushed, there was no depth to any of the characters and they completely left the themes of the original movie in the dumpster. I understand that they were trying to do something new and refreshing but this wasn't it. This movie was an atrocity to both original fans and the newer fans they were trying to reach out too. Better off sticking to the original animated movie.",Mulan
2820,jloy-1,Just amazing,10,4 September 2020,"I have a wife of Asian decent so both my kids loved the original Mulan. My daughter especially loved Mulan and has grown up to be just as fierce. This is not the cartoon, this is better. The visuals and the casting were perfect. This by far the best adaptation ever done from cartoon to live action of all time. If you are looking for a movie full of songs and jokes then watch the cartoon. If you are looking for something that will bring real honest emotion and pride then watch this one.

Move on. And as far as the price I came out cheaper then I would have taking all my family to the theater. 4 adults 3 kids. Your talking $100 dollars just in tickets. If you don't like the price you can wait the three months when they drop the price.,Mulan
2825,francinecottenden,Best Live Action,10,6 September 2020,For me this is by far one of the best live action Disney films. I appreciated it did not mirror the animation as I'm not sure that would have worked but there were many 'tip of the hat' moments to the original. Disney did however incorporate more of the true Chinese folk lore of Mulan. Well done Disney.,Mulan

I truly enjoyed this movie. It was fun, uplifting and exciting. For those that didn't like Mulan, I believe they are ignoring all the positives in this movie and only focusing on what they want it to be. They are not seeing what it is. Is This is a beautiful story of a woman finding her place in her family, in life and beyond. It can be an inspiration to many different people. As a father I look in my mind's eye at my own daughter, just having graduated college, leaving home and searching for her place in life.

It is as good movie, of course some parts could be better but the message is very on point. It is more profound than ""I'm going to fight for my father"". I really liked Mulan - humble and strong - and the witch was a good add for sending the message here.
As a fan of the animated one this went beyond my expectations (not like Alladin wich was a huge disappointment).
And no, dont take your 5-yeard old to this",Mulan
2835,thecampbellsarecoming,Epic Chinese Storytelling,9,4 December 2020,"I heard all the whining about this movie in the months leading to watching it today - I was left puzzled by all the hoopla. If you want cartoons, stick to them. I appreciate what Disney has done to grow up the original Mulan. While Chinese movie purists will likely find fault, I thought that the telling of the Hua Mulan history/mythology was engaging and (addressing the elephant in the room) superior to the original in terms of character treatment (i.e., the did not have to act like clowns this time). The cinematography is good. The mystical additions were not western, but this is not a western movie. While some will point to ""girl power"" here, this, like the original, extols something declining in our modern culture - a fierce sense of family, respect, honor, truth and loyalty. In a week when I just watched a video clip of a high school football player blindsiding a referee because he did not like the call - we need more ""Mulan"" movies! To be honest, family values are one thing I always liked that about the original movie and the story core: the driver for Mulan's actions are to protect her father and family. That is a high virtue.
So I give it 9 out of 10 and will watch it again. Disney paid homage to the original without getting all sappy - well done there! If you did not know the original then you did not notice; however, if you knew the original, you were given some nice treats along the way (and through the credits). If you take the time to read up on who Hua Mulan was you will find some good nods to the original mythology.",Mulan
2836,matthijspiekartz,"Sorry guys, really tried to give it a shot",4,4 September 2020,"Guess this proves (to me) that good animated movies do not necessarily make good movies. There's some decent scenes but most make me cringe at best. To address the controversy, if this really is made for the Chinese market then maybe it's not even a bad thing that most western viewers dislike it, hope they really enjoy this movie there.My verdict: If you really enjoyed the other live-action remakes then watch it! Otherwise you'd be better off spending your money and time on something else.",Mulan
2837,jsc-65439,Perspective from a Chinese person,10,5 September 2020,"I'm a first generation Asian American. I watched this with my family and other Asian older families. They actually all really enjoyed the historical accuracy of that period that Disney put into this film. How all the actors and actresses were all Asian. How we appreciate the enemy was changed from Hun to Rouran for historical accuracy. I'm glad there were no talking animals.
Though this is quite different from the cartoon, it's a really good different. Personally, I think if they just did a duplicate of the cartoon into live action, it wouldn't be appealing to me. This was realistic, believable, and full of Chinese culture, history and values. And it was still pretty entertaining.
Even the battle scenes were pretty historically accurate in displaying battle tactics.",Mulan

2855,lrkasch-93992,I LOVED everything about this movie!!!,10,8 December 2020,"I am seriously amazed at all the negative reviews. I was blown away by this movie! While this may be different than the cartoon, it is a reimagining. It's not supposed to be exactly the same. I thought it was beautifully filmed, the characters were amazing and it was full of excitement, heart, love and adventure. I loved everything about it! I will watch this movie over and over again. Those who are disappointed, I am not sure what they were expecting? It is perfect.And to those saying it ruined your childhood because it's not what you expected? Please stop. If you didn't like it, move along. Stick to the original then. The remaking of this movie (or any others) does nothing to change the original or change your childhood. Relax.",Mulan

Sure there were areas that fell short, it seemed as if the scenes were too fast paced and the story moved a little too quickly. There were also some inconsistencies throughout but what movie doesn't have those. What's annoying is the people saying this movie is terrible because it is nothing like the original Mulan. What original Mulan are we talking about here? The animated movie? I hate to break it to you guys but the original Mulan wasn't a animated movie, it was a story Written in Chinese scripture. This movie is meant to more accurately depict the true story of Mulan without it being westernized. Saying this movie is terrible because there's no music number like the 1998 version is just plain idiotic. The movie is great overall. If you had never seen the 1998 animated version of this story, and watched this, then most people would have a different opinion.

2862,donatellazanon,Mulan (2020) is as Chinese as Panda Express,2,8 September 2020,"When Mulan (2020) was announced, headlines and press all over the world had their eyes on this up-coming live-action remake of the 1998 homonymous cartoon. Mulan's filmmakers promised fans a film immersed in the Chinese tradition and culture, true to the original Chinese poem, where the famous heroine first came to life, and stripped from the western details added in the original animation. Turns out the film half followed the plot line set from the cartoon and half tried to get to the core of Chinese history and literature, failing at both tasks. A hybrid film that is westernised in almost all its aspects and presents half backed characters with non-existent or badly executed character arcs, Mulan (2020) is disappointing under multiple aspects. Mulan stars as a superhero who doesn't really have to fight hard and long to prove herself, find her place and achieve the respect of her fellow companions; her strength and tenacity are justified by a misinterpretation of what ""Qi"" actually is - an energy that flows through all living creatures -, that is represented on screen under the idea of a ""magical power"". Hello Force, is that you? The other characters portray the exact same problems: bad characterisation and lack of a cohesive and coherent character development.
Live-actions and remakes are a market that nobody asked for and yet still exists, and this film is the living proof of this statement. Expositional dialogue after expositional dialogue the script has crushed Mulan's character into another Avenger of sorts. If the goal was making the story more authentic, the film has completely missed the mark.",Mulan

They actually managed to mess up my favourite Disney movie, with the worst story and the crappiest character development I've possibly ever seen. This movie was so boring and lifeless, it just makes me want to rewatch the original to cleanse my eyes.The cinematics look beautiful, but it looks like that's where they put all their money into. Even the acting was alright. It's just the story...I'm all for feminism, but this was just TOO much. Where was the romance? Where was the comedy? Where were the songs? Why didn't they make it as a musical, like the remake of Beauty and the Beast? I just don't understand the choices in this. This could've been great, but they wasted it all just to give us ANOTHER feminist message, with a second random female ""enemy"" warrior, that didn't make any sense. Why not just let Mulan be the only female warrior, it was way more powerful that way. And where was Mushu, and the other characters that gave the original so much humor and life?I never write reviews, but I just had to for this one because I appreciate the original so much and I'm SO disappointed.

Going into the film I knew characters from the original were missing however I did not know that they would be replaced with a shapeshifter because that makes sense. Acting wasnt great. Some scenes that either defy gravity or were just so unrealistic made me cringe throughout the film. Luckily I did not have to pay the ridiculous $30usd to see it or I would've been more upset about how awful it was. I felt like it was a late 80s international film.

The film is actually very good. If you're looking for a live action film à la Aladdin, the Lion King, this isn't for you. Whilst I absolutely adore those retellings, I fully respect them for going in a different direction with this. The action sequences are amazing to watch and the story adapts well to a live action adaptation. Yes, I would've loved to have seen Mushu, and all the classic songs, but the film works without them.The cinematography is excellent throughout, and the costumes and set are sublime, as you'd expect. There are few historical updates Disney have made which work well too.Having said all of this, I do find that the characters aren't as well defined in this version of Mulan. Whereas in the original, Mulan's soldier friends are fairly well set out and identifiable for their personalities, the same cannot be said for the characters in this film, and at times they can seem two dimensional. But don't let that put you off too much!All in all, it's a great action/adventure film that carries the spirit of the original tale, and the message of Disney's classic. Weirdly, you just kinda have to put the original film aside and give it a chance to enjoy it.",Mulan

To give it credit, the scenario was really beatiful, the colors were stunning, really something nice for the eye, but that's it.
The acting was bland in every character, there was no emotion transmited (not even in their voices), and even withouth songs they tried hard to get the feeling we were watching them doing the same things, in a cold way.
I really missed Mulán grandmother, it was a nice character, instead we get Mulán's sister, who doesn't stand out.
I really really wanted to enjoy this film, but was too hard to watch, the fact we don't get the ancester spirits watching over her, but we can get some weird flying witch and people who walks in walls it's nonsense. And to top it is the ""chi"" thing.
I really don't understand what were they trying to do, other Disney live action are entertaining, have songs, love, characters with development, even fight scenes that give you a little emotion, but this was the opposite. Why was this not a musical? I still wonder that.
The worst though, was the fact that our heroine didn't even had to make any effort, she just ran away and show the world her real power. It's absurd, she was the best ever just because, and doesn't make you sympathise with her because she doesn't make any effort.

I feel like it really told what it was like in that time/era. What else could they have replaced Mushu with other than a phoenix like I absolutely love that too. They had the history on Phoenixes right as well. Along the lines of the relationship situation I feel like they would be able to bring it to life in the second movie. Now that I understand why they did the prime for the time they did was ""as it was in theaters"". I will do my best to buy it wen more movies come out.

2898,martaisabelcosta,Not a masterpiece but not bad either...,10,7 September 2020,"I've always loved the animated version of Mulan so I was really hoping this movie would do it justice. However something that was available since the trailer for anyone who actually researched it ,was that this movie would not be like the animation at all, so comparisons should stop there.This movie has beautiful sceneries and amazing shots, however when it came to the story it felt like everything was rushed... It seems like some shots were missing and because of that we didn't get details, which disconnects the viewer from the movie .The script could've been better, don't get me wrong this movie had everything to be a classical soulful Disney movie, however because of the poorly written scripts and sometimes lack of emotion from the actors themselves the movie kinda falls flat. Despite this there are some very powerful scenes in this movie that actually gave me goosebumps and overall made me jump from my seat in excitment and absolute awe, like for example the scene where Mulan discards her armor and we hear ""Reflection"" playing on the background.I also really loved the relationahip dynamic between Mulan and Xian Lang , even though they chose different paths I liked that instead of fighting they found common ground, afterall these characters are the reflection of each other: two women with amazing strength and talent who were shunned because of their gender.Overall this movie is not a masterpiece, it lacks simplicity , some things were way too far fetched like the apperance of the phoenix which wasn't necessary yet could be some kind of allusion towards Mushu. The fact that Xian Lang is a witch is completely unecessary to the actual plot and even the ""romantic relationship"" between Mulan and Hounghui is not only rushed but also completely meaningless and kinda cringey since it has no actual development and only appears in the end of the movie without any hint prior to that moment.Nevertheless it is a good movie, that exhales female power and brings a fresh perspective on main female characters giving a modern approach to an already beloved character.",Mulan

I grew up with the original Mulan and loved it but can part with that (also historically incorrect) take on the story. That's no problem- this is art! 😃 The issue for me is ""men's arrogance"" is once again the true underlying evil. 😴 It's not a new idea to have a strong woman lead and make men her enemy. It's boring. Also why couldn't they use that same imagination to NOT have the main men in the army be bumbling buffoons?! If that can make Mulan fly at age 8 can we have some male characters that aren't goofy idiots. They were scared but brave too. Oh yeah...only a woman could help them see that. Their families, homes and honor weren't important to them. 🙄The Huns wanted to kill men, women and children all the same. Mulan wasn't fighting male Privilege, she wanted to save her family and emperor's kingdom at large. Just keep it at that and it's a great story of a selfless woman doing an incredibly brave thing that should be told for years to come. Batwoman (CW), Wonder Woman (1984), and capt marvel were all let downs because the story was sacrificed for current day social issues. 🤢I love women! A LOT but Disney is looking to their equity agenda instead of reimagining stories that can captivate ALL people. Not just young girls who need to go into STEM fields. I literally called so many lines that were predictable digs at how female suppression was at the root of the ancient evil. Give me a break of that Kit Kat bar plzzzzzzzzz! 😩",Mulan

2905,huntressamanda,Gross,1,22 December 2020,"I am a huge fan of the animated movie and was actually okay with the removal of the musical aspect and mushu but this was a terrible adaptation. They replace the novice bettering herself through hard work with a chosen one with magical powers. Leave that to Star Wars and Buffy. I mean wouldn't we all be annoyed if Joan of Arc ran across the side of castle as if there were no gravity?
Spilting Shang into two characters was fine but they reduced the roles to something that wasn't useful to the plot anymore. Delete them and you'll miss nothing. No growth, no relevant conflict.
Mulan is blank and lifeless. They removed even her cleverness from the animated movie. It's such a win for women when she figures out how to climb the pole but this is all removed for a scene where she beats the men to the top of a mountain...like what? Women biologically have less muscle and stamina than men, we usually have to beat them with brains not brawn. (They only kept the clever moment in the mountain battle.) The animated movie covers this in spades but this movie deletes that message and replaces it with girls need magic to beat men. Yeah, that's a good message.
But the original aside. The scenery is choppy, there's no smooth transition, you're left wondering where they're at. Mulan immediately knows her male name to give when asked, when did she figure that out? There are weak attempts at humor that fall flat. There's a random phoenix (that looks like a CGI kite from the 90s) that seems to have little purpose (mushu's replacement?).
Over all, this movie sends horrible messages about women, has shallow conflict, an inchworm's worth of character growth and a choppy plot. Mulan just goes from great to awesome (yawn) and falls in love with nobody (wait what? Wasn't that one guy listed as her love interest?) Oh and don't get me started on the villainous bird lady who has a last minute change of heart. (Whatever)

2906,Paperuccio,Wasn't Expecting To Love It This Much - Don't Trust the Bad Reviews,9,2 January 2021,"I will start this review with the premise that Disney is ""my life"", and Mulan has been my favorite animated movie since it came out when I was five. I grew up with it and was a bit skeptical about it having a live-action version.At the beginning of the movie, I was disappointed with some of the changes (I don't want to put any spoilers in here), the lack of my favorite songs... But once I wrapped my head around this movie being an ACTION MOVIE and not a remake, I started enjoying it more and more... and by the end, I had goosebumps.
I highly recommend watching it, maybe forgetting what the animated version was about, just for these reasons: the fighting scenes were epic, it was a nice homage to the animated movie, closer to the Chinese heritage (from what I can tell, even though I am no expert on the matter), led by a strong woman and honoring the value of the Family.

In ancient China, colours and patterns represent social ranking. It feels embarrassed to see the emperor in a costume more humble and poor than the others.
Last but definitely not least, the removal of the songs has decreased the strength of plot and characteristics. It won't be a problem if the songs or characters from the animation are removed. But it would be a problem when there is no replacement to emphasise the theme or the epiphany of the character.
This is surely the worst movie I have ever seen.",Mulan
2911,Gofysmf,It is not a Remake,8,5 September 2020,"If you see this movie as a remake of the animated version, of course it will be bad, because this movie is trying to capture something different, is based in the same story, but is not the same movie.
In it's own is great, not the best, but is good enough to be enjoyable. there are a few bad choices in terms of scenography and camera, but not enough to be something that bad. The worst feeling is that the beggining and the ending felt like were directed by totally ifferent directors, as in the beggining the fantastical feeeling was more intense.
The actress did. great job, great acting, but i won't talk about the others, some characters felt forced and just filling.
The most wonderful thing about this movie is the cultural respect portrayed, not a single feeling of cultural apropiation or disrespect, that was amazing.
Give it a chance, it is a great movie if you can realize that is a different movie from the animated one",Mulan

2913,micahdear,"A great movie, especially for young women to watch.",8,7 September 2020,"This title should be added to a long list of great Disney movies that can provide young women with the inspiration to become more! That nothing can stop you.The pros: great actors, great characters, great story line.The cons: a little to much crouching tiger..",Mulan
2914,himawanardiansyah,Very Epic!!!!!!!,10,7 September 2020,"The story is very amazing, Action of the actors is very cool, Cinematography and visuals are very stunning and colorful. Highly recommended for fantasy movie lovers👌",Mulan
2915,stevedaviescreative,Ignore the bad reviews,9,11 December 2020,"Loved this, beautiful cinematography, heartwarming and uplifting! Don't worry that it's different to the original. Some scenes of fighting not suitable to young ones but otherwise a full thumbs up!",Mulan
2916,mikesjhong,Dishonored the movie,1,7 September 2020,"What a disappointment. This movie half assed being a Disney movie and half assed being a Chinese martial arts movie. I felt cheated out of the songs, Mushu, and the Grandma. They had such great talent with stars like Donnie Yen, and didn't really do anything with them. I'm fine with plot changes, but if you do for a remake at least make sure it is better than the original. Come on Disney - you're better than this",Mulan
2917,cwehner,Erase the original from your mind.,9,22 November 2020,"I guess the reason I liked this movie is I never saw the original. Just a great movie, great story, wonderful photography, fantastic music and I have always been amazed at this era of Chinese history.",Mulan
2918,isabelstainforth,It was okay,6,13 September 2020,"Honestly, if I hadn't watched the original mulan, maybe I would've rated this higher. The whole film was pretty average. I enjoyed some of it, but I felt like it didn't capture my attention as much as the animated one. I honestly wish the original songs were in this movie, it would've really made me happy. I do wish they kept Mulan's original love interest. I know that no matter what direction the movie went, not everyone would be pleased-but I waited forever for this movie to come out, it just didn't reach my expectations.",Mulan
2919,zhoujy-10446,Great actress,5,12 September 2020,I love the story so much! Wonderful filmmaking and actors actresses!,Mulan
2920,vmizobuti,Disappointing,4,11 September 2020,"I was excited about this movie. I enjoyed the original animation as an asian kid, and I didn't cared that they wanted to remove Mushu and the songs. I am fine with an adaptation that wanted to be historically precise, realistic and more appealing to non-Western audiences. Yet, what they deliver are stunning visuals devoid of any meaning.The dialogues are dry, the transitions are poorly executed, and there is little to no character development. Supporting characters have no purpose, and not a single arc between them and Mulan is properly concluded. They reference asian kung-fu movies through pastiche photography, without really understanding how asian cinema conveys its messages. Not to mention their complete failure in attempting to make battles look more realistic through clean soldiers and not a single drop of blood. It is raw and infantile at the same time, fused into something that is embarassing.It is very unfortunate that in an attempt to make justice to the richness of Chinese culture, they delivered a generic, unrelatable, and shallow movie like this one.",Mulan
2921,scarlettfsteenhart,Terrible,1,6 December 2020,"I LOVED the original and I was excited for a live action, but I was extremely disappointed for it was painfully inaccurate and was poorly made, the storyline was completely changed and many characters were taken out. Along with music which I didn't think Disney would do. Super unhappy with the new movie overall wouldn't recommend",Mulan
2922,lwdnasa,There is nothing in it other than the look of it. A waste of time,3,7 September 2020,The costume is good. The look of the movie over all is good. And that is it. The story is so incomplete and meaningless that it's just another Disney princess cliche with a Chinese cover on top of it. Save ur money and time for better things. Also don't watch it cuz it's gonna ruin your good memory of the 1998 Mulan.,Mulan
2923,annelieseleach,Just bad.,1,17 September 2020,"Lost all the character, message, and charm of the original.The soundtrack was one of the WORST aspects of this movie, second only to its action sequences.Disney missed the mark in a painfully cringey and disappointing way. If I could give 0 stars, I would.",Mulan
2924,spencer-90336,Beyond the animated film,7,5 September 2020,Besides the film having few references to the original film and a rough beginning it turns around in the end. I would say it is still worth watching. Giving it a harsh review for not being identical to the original is silly. The Ballad of Mulan remains the same despite the lack of suicide on Mulan's part. Just watch the movie. It's decent.,Mulan
2925,andreajauss,INCREDIBLE!!!,10,7 September 2020,These are the movies young girl's needs to see. The entire movie was absolutely incredible. Captivating and powerful. I loved it far more than the original I grew up with. I sure hope there is a sequel.,Mulan
