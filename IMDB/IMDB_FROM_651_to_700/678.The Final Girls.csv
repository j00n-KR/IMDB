0,MartinHafer,A nice time passer,7,30 November 2017,"A few years ago, I went to a panel at New York ComicCon all about ""The Final Girls"". The movie hadn't yet debuted but the cast and filmmakers were there to hype the production. I enjoyed the panel but forgot to see the movie...and finally got around to it tonight. And, it turned out to be a decent little film. And, when I say 'little' it's because the film was low-budgeted and seemed to come and go rather quickly. Fortunately, the DVD is available through Netflix and it's worth your time.Before going on, it's important to note that I am talking about ""The Final Girls""...not ""The Final Girl"" from 2010.The story is about a group of five friends who inexplicably get stuck in a bad 1980s slasher film. While they know what's going to happen, they have a heck of a time avoiding death and only a seeming miracle can stop the killing machine, Billy.The film is a combination of comedy and pathos. I wish the film had focused more on comedy but my wife disagreed and liked the mix. Regardless, the film has many clever moments and is a nice sendoff of the genre. Worth seeing. And, it's one of the few films that features outtakes at the end that actually ARE worth seeing.",The Final Girls
1,SnoopyStyle,fun satirical homage to 80's horror,7,30 July 2016,"Amanda Cartwright (Malin Akerman) is a struggling actress trying to live down her icon role in the 80's slasher movie ""Camp Bloodbath"". She and her daughter Max (Taissa Farmiga) get into a car crash. Three years later, Max reluctantly attends a tribute screening of her late mother's most famous role. She is joined by her best friend Gertie Michaels (Alia Shawkat), Gertie's stepbrother horror-fan Duncan (Thomas Middleditch), fawning Chris (Alexander Ludwig), and Chris' jealous ex-girlfriend Vicki (Nina Dobrev). A fire starts in the theater. Max finds a machete and cuts into the screen. She and her friends escape the fire into the movie world. They encounter Max's mom playing Nancy and the rest of the cast. There's the womanizing Kurt and slutty Tina. The movie won't let them go and is suppose to end when the final girl Tina kills the masked killer Billy.It's a fun loving satirical stab at the 80's horror genre. It's Scream with more tongue in cheek. It also has a great heart with Max reuniting with a version of her mother. It's too bad that the outrageous Kurt and Tina don't last longer. The cast is great. It's a good homage to those movies with a few laughs and happy memories.",The Final Girls
2,claudio_carvalho,Has Potential to Become Cult-Movie,7,25 October 2015,"The teenager Max Cartwright (Taissa Farmiga) misses her mother Amanda Cartwright (Malin Akerman), who died three years ago in a car accident. Amanda was a horror movies actress that has become famous because of her character Nancy in the cult slasher film ""Camp Bloodbath 1 & 2"". Max is invited by her friend Duncan (Thomas Middleditch), who is the brother of her best friend Gertie Michaels (Alia Shawkat), to participate in the lecture in the end of the session of ""Camp Bloodbath 1 & 2"" promoted by the fans in the movie theater. Max meets the handsome Chris Briggs (Alexander Ludwig), who has broken up with his girlfriend Vicki Summers (Nina Dobrev), and they stay together. Out of the blue, there is a fire in the theater and Max, Chris, Duncan, Gertie and Vicki try to escape through the screen. But soon they find that they are trapped in ""Camp Bloodbath 1"" with the characters Nancy, Kurt (Adam DeVine), Tina (Angela Trimbur) and Paula (Chloe Bridges) in the summer camp. Further, the serial-killer Billy Murphy (Dan B. Norris) is hunting them down.""The Final Girls"" is an entertaining parody to slasher films that has potential to become cult-movie. The story entwines ""Friday the 13th"" or any other slasher in a summer camp with the idea of ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" (1985), repeated in ""Last Action Hero"" (1993) and ""Pleasantville""(1998), where the viewer joins the characters in the film. There are many funny moments and Malin Akerman is so beautiful that convinces performing the role of the teenager Nancy. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Terror nos Bastidores"" (""Terror in the Backstage"")",The Final Girls
3,nogodnomasters,YOU JUST MESSED WITH THE WRONG VIRGIN,8,5 July 2018,"Amanda Cartwright (Malin Akerman) played Nancy in ""Camp Blood Bath"" a cult classic with a ""Friday the 13th"" script. She has a daughter Max (Taissa Farmiga) and loves the song ""Bette Davis Eyes."" Amanda dies in a traffic accident and three years later Max is coerced into going to a reunion showing of the film ""Camp Blood Bath."" During the feature Max and five of her friends get sucked into the film and integrate with the original cast which includes Max's deceased mother.The film is a comedy-horror. Taissa Farmiga nails the film. The way her eyes tear up and get glassy during scenes with her mom were actually too good and brought the comedy aspect down. The comedy and horror aspect could have been better. Many parts of the film had a sense of deja vu due to similarity with classic films, something they needed to extend to the entire film, i.e.. ""Scary Movie.""The concept for the film came from co-writer Joshua John Miller, whose dad Jason Miller ( Father Karras) died in the ""Exorcist."" He grew up watching his dad die in a film and wondered what it would be like if he was in the film with him.This is a good film, but seems to have been hyped in hopes of getting a lasting cult status. The writing just wasn't that great.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",The Final Girls
4,kosmasp,Without rules,6,13 July 2019,"Let's star in a horror movie. A PG-13 horror movie that is based on slasher films. Well if that sounds a bit toothless, I can assure you that many will look upon it that way. There's almost no blood on display (except for one scene) and there are also other ""major"" ingredients missing. The original plan was to make it an R-rated movie, which did not happen obviously. There are quite a few fun bits of trivia like that in the audio commentary (though according to them only 14 year olds listen to them - another joke in case that wasn't clear).Now up until now that may all have sounded quite harsh, which was not my intention. The movie is good fun, but I wanted to make sure people know what they get themselves into (no pun intended). A CGI crash early on in the movie is quite well done and nice to watch. As are the characters, that are a bit of a parody of whatever went on in the 80s. The actors have a lot of fun and it shows. Still there are too many conveniences and coincidences, an ending that tries to be clever and other things you'll either like or be annoyed by. Try to watch it without thinking too much and you'll have a good time - do not compare it with things like Cabin in the Woods though",The Final Girls
5,Woodyanders,Crafty slasher horror meta homage/send-up,8,28 July 2020,"Max Cartwright (a fine and appealing portrayal by Taissa Farmiga) and her friends attend a revival theater screening of the cheesy 80's slasher flick ""Camp Bloodbath."" Max and her friends all must fight for their lives after they are mysteriously sucked into the events happening in the movieDirector Todd Strauss-Schulson keeps the ingenious and engrossing story moving along at a brisk pace, maintains an engaging tongue-in-cheek tone throughout, and displays a true wholehearted love for corny body count fare. The clever script by M.A. Fortin and Joshua John Miller pokes wickedly witty fun at various tried'n'true slice'n'dice tropes that include gnarly 80's slang, the inevitable have sex and die cliche, dumb cardboard characters, and a seemingly unstoppable and indestructible killer (hulking Daniel Norris). (Alas, this film does punk out on both the graphic gore and gratuitous female nudity, both of which were key ingredients in 80's slasher flicks.) Better still, there are even several touching scenes between Max and her deceased actress mother Amanda (a luminous performance by Malin Akerman), who plays sweet shy girl Nancy in ""Camp Bloodbath.""Moreover, it's acted with zest by an enthusiastic cast: Alexander Ludwig as amiable hunk Chris Briggs, Nina Dobrev as the snarky Vicki Summers, Alia Shawkat as the brash Gertie Michaels, Thomas Middleditch as the nerdy Duncan, Adam Devine as crude horndog Kurt, and Angela Trimbur as the ditsy Tina. The surprise ending is a total pip. The spirited shivery synthesizer score by Eddy Zak and Gregory James Jenkins hits the spot-on shuddery spot. An absolute treat for fans of knife-kill horror fare.",The Final Girls
6,Tweekums,A fun homage to '80s slasher films,8,27 June 2021,"Max Cartwright is a young woman whose mother, a former horror movie actress, dies in the film's prologue. Three years later she is persuaded to attend a showing of her mother's most famous roll; a victim in 'Camp Blood', an '80s slasher. During the screening a fire breaks out in the cinema... suddenly Max and four friends find themselves in Camp Blood! They quickly realise that the movie is playing out around them and they are now potential victims of the films villain; a masked man with a giant machete named Billy.Before watching this I'd not even heard of it; I was just looking for a ninety minute horror movie on Netflix and thought it might be okay. It turns out it is more than okay. It is an enjoyably homage to '80s slasher movies, most obviously the 'Friday the 13th' franchise. It knowingly plays with the tropes of the genre as our protagonists know what is scripted to happen and the 'rules of the genre'. It does however feel toned down; the violence is less gory, there is no nudity to speak of and there are more humorous moments than scary ones. Also, unlike those '80s films, this one has characters one can really care about; most obviously Max and Nancy, the girl played by Max's mother. The cast does a fine job bringing their characters to life and the location has the right look for the type of film; it also has some good '80s music to help with the mood. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of '80s horror who want a good laugh.",The Final Girls
7,BA_Harrison,"Fun, but where's the blood and boobs?",7,12 October 2015,"Three years after the death of her actress mother Amanda (who really should have kept her eyes on the road), teenager Max (Taissa Farmiga) is talked into attending a showing of her mum's best known movie, cult '80s slasher Camp Bloodbath. When a fire breaks out in the theatre, Max and four of her school friends are forced to escape through the screen where they find themselves trapped inside the movie, stalked by its hulking, mask wearing, machete wielding killer, Billy Murphy.Written by M.A. Fortin and former actor Joshua Miller (who played the vampire kid in Near Dark), The Final Girls offers up no shortage of knowing clichés and clever meta-moments guaranteed to put a smile on the face of any self-respecting slasher fan: in order to improve their chances of survival, the pals must exploit their knowledge of slasher conventions, while dealing with such hurdles as black and white flashbacks and awkward moments of slow motion. Max also has the added issue of trying to preserve the life of camp counsellor Nancy, the character in the film that was played by her mother (a plot-line that adds genuine heart to the film).However, as ingenious as the script undoubtedly is, The Final Girls does miss the mark slightly by being a strictly PG-13 affair, director Todd Strauss-Schulson keeping the action free of the gore and nudity that is synonymous with '80s slashers. For the film to be absolutely true to the genre it is having so much fun with, there should have been at least one skinny dipping scene, some gratuitous sex, and a bit of decent splatter, but all it can offer is a few bloodless death scenes and a couple of the actresses in their underwear. For shame!6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for having camp slut Tina dance to Cherry Pie by Warrant (such a good tune that I'm willing to turn a blind eye to the fact that it wasn't even released until 1990).",The Final Girls
8,BandSAboutMovies,Slasher life lessons,5,3 December 2019,"Hey! Remember when I watched Isn't It Romantic?This is the same director making the same movie, except instead of learning lessons from a romantic comedy, people are learning lessons from a slasher film.After another failed audition, Max Cartwright's mother Amanda (Malin Akerman) worries that she'll only be known for appearing in the 1986 slasher favorite Camp Bloodbath. Sadly, she dies soon after in a car accident.A few years later, at a double feature of the film and its sequel, a fire breaks out and Max (now Taissa Farmiga, the sister of Vera) and her friends escape by slicing the screen with a machete. They then enter the world of Camp Bloodbath, where they must escape Billy Murphy, the twisted serial killer who carries a not unlike Jason Vorhees machete.There's a great cast - Alia Shawkat from Arrested Development is in it, as well as Thomas Middleditch from Silicon Valley and Adam DeVine from Workaholics.Writers M.A. Fortin and Joshua John Miller based the characters in this film on some of their favorite slasher films. Nancy (also played by Akerland) is inspired by Ginny from Friday the 13th Part 2 and her name comes from A Nightmare On Elm Street's Nancy Thompson. And Tina was based on P.J. Soles' character Lynda van der Klok in Halloween and Jodi Draigie's Morgan from The House on Sorority Row.Perhaps even more interesting, Miller wrote this movie to deal with the death of his father Jason Miller, who starred as Father Karras in The Exorcist. And even cooler than that is that Joshua John Miller played Homer in Near Dark, Tim in River's Edge and also showed up in Teen Witch.",The Final Girls
9,Coventry,"I want to watch ""Camp Bloodbath"" instead!",5,27 October 2015,"Slasher parodies, '80s throwbacks or homages  Call it whatever you want, but fact remains that horror comedies form a delicate sub-genre and it's extremely difficult to make one that does justice to both the comedy as well as the horror aspects. We primarily get to see zombie comedies, and they pretty much all suck tremendously, but lately there have been quite a lot of attempts to spoof the typical '80s slasher genre, although the ambitious young writers/directors usually prefer to call them ""tributes"" in order not to offend the die-hard slasher fan base (yours truly included). And they are damn right to be careful, because even though us, '80s slasher fanatics, are very much aware of the fact that most of them are terribly bad and amateurish, we still love them a lot! The principal gimmick in ""The Final Girls"" is that a group of 2015 teenagers are catapulted back in time and end up on the scene of a non-existent '80s slasher movie called ""Camp Bloodbath"". Admittedly the idea is refreshing and holds a lot of potential, but still the first thing that went through my twisted mind was: ""Damn, I'd rather just watch a real '80s slasher called ""Camp Bloodbath instead of this!"" But hey, as said, the basic plot concept is interesting and the film does contain a handful of creative elements and unexpected twists, so I must state that I overall enjoyed ""The Final Girls"" and don't regret watching it. The cute Max (Taissa Farminga from the first season ""American Horror Story"") lost her mother in a stupid car accident – paying attention to the road could have been an option – three years ago and understandably still misses her a lot. She was an unsuccessful actress who forever remained linked to her role as naive virgin in a cheesy '80s slasher movie called ""Camp Bloodbath"". That movie somehow became a cult hit and Max reluctantly accepts to attend a special screening of the film in the presence of her friends. When fire breaks out in the theater, Max and her friends try to escape by cutting a hole in the cinema screen and – you guessed it – inexplicably end up in the eighties and at the entrance of Camp Blue Finch where the events of the movie are about to start. Max knows that her teenage mother is supposed to die at the hands of a maniacal killer called Billy, but she intends to save her and messes up the whole original scenario. ""The Final Girls"" sounds like a lot of cheesy undemanding fun, and it is, as long as you don't think too much and set aside all the ""rules"" of time-traveling, paradoxes and film-in-film narrative structures. Personally I liked how the script almost promptly eliminates a couple of dreadful clichés (like ""tough chicks don't die"" or even getting rid of the annoying ""horror geek"" quite fast) but deeply regretted that the film doesn't contain any gratuitous nudity or gory massacres. I reckon the fact it's a PG-13 flick, but these two ingredients are essential and mandatory in case you're referring to eighties horror cinema.",The Final Girls
10,Hey_Sweden,One of the better movies I've seen lately.,8,20 October 2018,"""The Final Girls"" stars the very appealing Taissa Farmiga (younger sister of Vera F.) as ""Max"", daughter of a veteran actress (Malin Akerman) whose big claim to fame was co-starring in a summer camp slasher called ""Camp Bloodbath"". The mom dies, and Max reluctantly agrees to appear at a memorial screening of the film. Surreal events transpire that result in Max and her friends magically transported into the movie. There, Max becomes obsessed with helping her ""mom"" to survive, while she & her friends convince the characters in this movie-within-the-movie to become proactive.I'd heard good things about this one, and I'm happy to say that it doesn't disappoint. As has been said, it's a meta-slasher, but a rather clever one, and may be one of the most clever movies of its kind since Woody Allens' ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"". It satirizes so much that was common in vintage slashers, from the stock characters to the various tropes. Some genuine humour is derived from the fact that the ""Camp Bloodbath"" characters - who, of course, don't realize that that's what they are - could have been seen in any old 80s body count flick. Adam Devine, in particular, is a riot as obnoxious, sexually obsessed Kurt. And ""horror nerds"" like Duncan (Thomas Middleditch) also come in for ribbing. Overall, ""Camp Bloodbath"" plays like a hilarious parody of ""Friday the 13th"" and other camp themed slashers, complete with a hulking psycho (Daniel Norris) whose presence is announced by ""ki ki ki ma ma ma"" type vocalizations.Best of all, this movie has some real *heart* in addition to its jibes. It has characters with actual rooting interest; you do regret seeing some of them die. And you enjoy their incredible preparations for luring and trapping the monstrous killer.The cast is extremely engaging: Farmiga, Akerman, Alexander Ludwig, Nina Dobrev, Alia Shawkat, Middleditch, Devine, Angela Trimbur (the last is also quite funny in her portrayal of a typical horror movie bimbo).The filmmakers are also to be commended for their visual gimmicks, ex: when the flashbacks occur.For a split second, I was annoyed by the resolution, but after some thought, realized: how COULD it end any other way? There are few movie conventions as ripe for parody as horror movie conventions!Eight out of 10.",The Final Girls

Director Todd Strauss-Schulson gets all the right moves down pact with classic horror tropes and its SCREAM-inspired screenplay by M.A. Fortin and Joshua John Miller crams just enough violence, sexual overtones and unexpected poignancy in the mix of this fun/scary salute to slasher pics.",The Final Girls
12,morrison-dylan-fan,The Final Friday for The Final Girls.,8,16 October 2016,"With October coming up I started looking round for a Horror Comedy that a friend would enjoy.Getting to the end of the first page of Horror Comedy movies on Amazon UK,I stumbled on an awesome looking recent Slasher Comedy (!) that I've not heard anything about,which led to me starting the final countdown.View on the film:Restricted by the studio over how much flesh and blood could be put on show,director Todd Strauss-Schulson & cinematographer Elie Smolkin impressively gather other knives to hack into the Slasher spirit.Driving into the camp, Schulson and Smolkin surround their body bags pit with endless fog lining the walls and lush bursts of yellow clothes and fresh green grass giving the flick a summer shine. Lining up the hapless gangs for the big Camp Bloodbath baddie, Schulson takes a dip into the Giallo sub-genre via splashing the camp in vivid,ultra-stylised red,blue and yellow filters,and smoothly- delivered whip-pans going in search for ""The Final Girl.""Experiencing Horror ""cultdom"" themselves by one being the star in Near Dark and the other co-writing this as a tribute to his dad Jason Miller,the screenplay by M.A. Fortin and Joshua John Miller wickedly turn all of the Slasher traditions on their head,by pushing everything from the sexually eager jock to the good old Christian Final Girl just that bit into the absurd,where the cliché 80's dialogue is hilariously crushed by a broken 4th wall.Keeping the Slasher mystery itself simplistic with some sly nods to past flicks,the writers superbly blend a taking apart of the genre, (from the ""party girl"" being unable to stop herself from stripping,to the gang being unable to escape a slow motion run with the killer) with an excellent amount of heart,as Max rips out all the horror staples to find her mum in the pages.Switching from sassy mum to dancing Scream Queen,the sexy Malin Akerman gives an amazing performance as Nancy/ Amanda Cartwright,thanks to Akerman giving Nancy a playful,flirty shell which unexpectedly cracks into something heartfelt,as Cartwright destroys the image of the Slasher ""dumb blonde.""

13,kannibalcorpsegrinder,A slight missed opportunity but still highly enjoyable,8,8 November 2016,"Trying to get over her mothers' death, a teen and her friends agree to attend a screening of her old horror film at a local retrospective only to become trapped within the film itself and must put their knowledge of the film and the genre to get them through the movie and leave alive.For the most part this here was a highly enjoyable and engaging throwback to the slasher films of the past. The fact that this one really manages to nail the genre theme and feel of the camp-set slasher film of the time-period is it's greatest plus here, effectively capturing that atmosphere to it's fullest. The few early parts of the film before their entrance set this in motion rather well by maintaining that tone and feel so that when it turns into the slasher film angle with them involved there's quite a lot more fun to come here. The scenes of them finding the different participants in the camp out in the forest where they witness the first killer ambush and begin interacting with the results gives this a pretty enjoyable expectation for what's to come, and with them being inducted into the group gives this the greatest set-up here for the film's great battles with the killer. Those are far more enjoyable action-packed moments here with the big trap set against him with the different traps set up in the main hall and how he gets past them leading to a set of battles against the killer throughout the cabin as the remaining survivors begin fighting back against the killer in the backroom as well as the upper floors as they bring their traps into full use letting the action go throughout into the last big confrontation at the house that really plays into the emotional trauma storyline that's been building throughout here and especially in the last section. That as well is another big deal in the fact that there's a great deal of work done here to detail that part of story and it comes off far better than expected here without it being detrimental to the pacing which really had the potential to be an issue and really adds a nice depth to this one. With all these added together to the rather nice comedy throughout here, there's quite a lot to like here though there's still a few flaws which does hold this back. The main issue with this one is the fact that it really holds itself back from what it really could've been if only it would've been more willing devote to the comedy potential of it's central premise. The idea of being aware of a movie and then being forced to guide the cast through like what's happening here could've provided this one with a spectacular storyline, but far too much of this one is spent on the mother/daughter relationship, which even though it's great stuff there's a stumbling with the slasher antics as there's very little gore and absolutely no nudity which these usually provide. As well, there's a rather simplistic and ludicrous manner of entering the movie-within-the-movie as the theater accident is way too contrived and comes off without any real explanation for what's going on, leaving it with very little to like about it. Otherwise, this one really had a lot to like.Rated PG-13: Violence, Language, drug use and sexual references.",The Final Girls
14,Wuchakk,Amusing slasher parody with heart,6,18 August 2018,"This is a parody of 80's slasher flicks, especially the Friday the 13th franchise. The story revolves around five teens somehow being translated into a fictitious 1986 slasher movie called ""Camp Bloodbath."" The prematurely deceased mother (Malin Akerman) of the teen heroine (Taissa Farmiga) starred in the movie and she gets to meet her again, albeit as a young woman.While this 2015 film is a throwaway flick it's reasonably entertaining, especially if you're familiar with slasher films. What I like best is that it has heart and you can feel the loving relationship of mother and daughter. It's also nice to see Nina Dobrev again, who's one of the most alluring females in the cast, although she's outshined by curvy Angela Trimbur as airhead Tina.The movie runs 1 hour, 28 minutes and was shot in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with some stuff done in Los Angeles.GRADE: B-",The Final Girls

A group of teens (including creepy Vera Farmiga clone Taissa Farmiga and Arrested Development's Alia Shawkat) are magically transported into a 1980s horror film (don't ask how; it's so stupid it makes my brain hurt) that stars Farmiga's deceased mother (Malin Akerman). Akerman is slated for an early death, but Farmiga attempts to defy horror movie conventions and save her. It's a fun conceit, but not much about it works. Partly it feels that the filmmakers were limited by budget. Not that this movie had to be really expensive, but the whole thing is digitally shot and special effected-up and it has this hideous look throughout. It's also limited by its PG-13 rating. It's all too bad, because the film has about five really big laughs in it. Angela Trimbur is best in show as the 1980s horror movie slut, and Adam DeVine (of Workaholics fame) is funny as the 1980s horror movie douche.

16,trashgang,spoof and ode to the slasher era,8,3 June 2016,"When I saw who was in it I had my doubts. Not due the acting but the age being in the twenties I thought it was going to be one for the teenagers walking on this planet. But have seen the trailer somehow it attracted me because it's a throwback to the early horror genre, the excellent slasher era from the eighties. Also knowing that it had a bit of comedy in it I plugged it in...Yes, this is clearly an ode or should I say a spoof to the slasher genre, but made with taste and not like all those stupid spoofs based on horror flicks. It starts with a trailer for a slasher and it's so well made that it was a walk down memory lane 'cause I was there in the eighties in full bloom due that era. From there on you go through an accident, full CGI, with a car but it's so well done that the CGI didn't bother me at all. The fun part is that the viewers at the cinema are going into the flick which give you awkward situations, a cell phone in the eighties, you can guess it. But there are other moments like falling over words (to tell you you are in a certain year) do make it laughable. Naturally they are making slashers a big joke with all clichés included, well almost because no red stuff to see or nudity or POV from the killer. But hey, you will have your laughs here and there. For those geeks of the slashers go check it out, the trailer mentioned is worth seeing and the opening credits ripped from The Thing (1982) or the sound from Friday The 13th (1980) and there's more.

I can not imagine how they will score really good horror movies then. This is supposed to be a horror/comedy, or a parody of a horror movie, but besides Adam DeVine I really didn't see anybody funny in The Final Girls. It all starts with images of a really bad slasher B-movie and you start wondering if that's going to be the rest of the movie. But then you see it change into a normal movie and you are kind of relieved. But then they have the greatest dumb idea ever to project the whole cast into the slasher B-movie.

Instead, the characters of this film are just as linear and not inventive as the characters in the film they are thrown in. But even so, it could have been fun but for the ending. The ending invalidates the entire premise of the film and robs the viewer of any kind of closure.And that is too bad, because I like most of the actors, since they all play in some TV series or another. Unfortunately, the script did not develop the characters outside their ""default setting"" and even if the writers would have wanted to, I doubt they would have had the time in a single movie. Is that the reason why they basically made this as basically an episode in a mini series? I hope so, but the first part does not give my much in that direction.Bottom line: this is not a full movie, but the first part of a ""double feature"".

Mainly because of the cover, I thought it was going to be a cheap unimaginative movie with some terrible acting. Well the acting isn't superb, but it's a comedy so it's passable. And the movie itself was actually quite fun to sit through. Yeah, it's a spoof on slasher flicks and has a PG-13 rating. But that has almost no effect on end result. It's execution is actually quite interesting and some ideas that play upon the generic slasher genre is actually quite innovative. For a movie such as this it's difficult to pull off those actually endearing moments without it being too corny. But I thought it was done quite well. Sure, it does have some cheesy and corny parts but those aspects actually works for this movie. If you are somewhat seen your share of horror and slasher movies this one just might be worth checking out. I personally liked it. The end sets up for a sequel, but I am not quite sure I would want that.

It tells the story of a teen girl, and her friends, who are sucked into the world of a 1980s slasher movie, costarring the girl's deceased mother; a former popular scream queen. The movie was directed by Todd Strauss- Schulson (who also directed the 2011 stoner-comedy sequel 'A VERY HAROLD & KUMAR 3D Christmas') and it was written by M.A. Fortin and Joshua John Miller. It stars Taissa Farmiga, Malin Akerman, Adam DeVine, Thomas Middleditch, Alexander Ludwig, Nina Dobrev, Alia Shawkat, Angela Trimbur, Tory N. Thompson, Chloe Bridges and Dan B. Norris. With the exception of it being a censored vision (shamelessly rated PG-13), it's a lot of fun and a decent throwback.Max Cartwright (Farmiga) recently lost her mother, Amanda (Akerman), in a car accident. Amanda was an aspiring actress, who was once a popular scream queen; known for the 80s cult classic slasher film 'CAMP BLOODBATH'. Three years after her mother's passing, Max reluctantly agrees to attend a special screening; of 'CAMP BLOODBATH', and it's first sequel 'CAMP BLOODBATH 2: CRUEL SUMMER', with her friends. During the movie, a couple drunk viewers accidentally cause a theater fire. Max slits a hole in the theater screen, for her and her friends to escape through, but they instead magically enter the world of the movie. Max gets to meet her mother's character, inside the film world, but she also meets Billy Murphy (Norris); the notorious masked killer, of the film series. The group must find a way to stay alive, and defeat Billy, in order to get back to the real world safely.The film is funny, and a brilliant homage to 80s slasher flicks; having grown-up on horror movies, like 'FRIDAY THE 13TH', I absolutely loved it! The acting is all great (especially DeVine and Middleditch), the directing is perfectly fitting (and campy) and the screenplay is witty, meta and cool; it's so much fun. There's also a surprising amount of well-done drama, involving the mother/daughter relationship; one of the writer's fathers (actor Jason Miller) also died on screen, in the classic horror film 'THE EXORCIST'. So the movie pretty much has it all. My only major complaint, is that it's PG-13 (something I didn't realize, until I got about a third of the way into it); and therefore it has no nudity, sex, bad language (except very briefly) or gore (all major necessities in classic slasher flicks). This movie could have been a truly great cult classic (just like the movies it's trying to emulate), if the producers (and studio backing it) actually had some balls! It's still a fun movie though; especially if you love horror flicks. It's just kind of like watching one that's edited for TV!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13nGzq8Gvgo",The Final Girls
21,thesar-2,Back to the Fright,9,11 October 2015,"By minute two, I loved this movie and its originality. I loved the setup, the actresses, mainly my new girl-crush: Malin Akerman and the immediate homage to my childhood movies. Thenby minute 5, it shifted and I loved that originality. In fact, let's just say this film rarely let me down.It surely helped that slasher films are my favorite type of horror, not to mention 80s slashers and especially Friday the 13th are king to me. Also, I am very fond of Adam DeVine and the Comedy-Horror meshups, i.e. The Cabin in the Woods, Scary Movie and Student Bodies. So this movie hit all the points.And boy, was it funny. So hilarious at times, I was laughing thoroughly out loud during many of the scenes. It carefully covered the clichés without ever making them clichés themselves – as most of these movies sadly can't overcome, and gave us everything we needed from our slasher fix plus a real and sometime heartfelt story.I will NOT go into the plot or what the movie's about as I went into this movie completely blind. It's perfect to do just that as you never know what to expect.But, suffice to say, if you are a slasher fan, 80s or not and you like a spoof without actually reducing itself just to comedy bits this is the perfect film for you. I cannot see this NOT landing in my top three best list of the year.",The Final Girls

23,bowmanblue,Finally a new take on a 'slasher' movie,7,22 February 2017,"Okay, so it's not THAT new – after all, you still have a killer running around hacking up a selection of good-looking American teens, but – hey – it's still better than most of the recent offerings. The premise kind of reminded me of (the much underrated) 'Last Action Hero' in as much as people from our 'real' world end up getting stuck in a movie. However, instead of being the 'comedy relief' to a much-loved Austrian mega-star, our hapless teens find themselves in the traditional middle-of-nowhere setting where they're at the mercy of a fictional masked killer (who bears no small resemblance to one Jason Voorhees).Therefore, like the 'Last Action Hero,' expect all the clichés and formulas from a horror/slasher movie to be pointed out along the way (not to mention the odd gruesome kill thrown in there).There are no real stand-out performances here as, despite being a reasonably original take, the character types are pretty much what you'd expect, i.e. the good girl, the trampy girl, the best friend and so on. However, this time round it's all a little more 'knowing' and at least they're aware of their own stereotypes.There are also a few touching moments in the script towards the end that you probably wouldn't expect from a film of this genre. These actually make a welcome break from the general quips and carnage.I wouldn't have watched this film based on either the cover or the title. I should have mentioned that the 'film within a film' is set in the eighties, therefore the cover art is all pretty 'retro' and I thought it just looked like another run-of-the-mill slasher flick. Don't let this put you off. It is definitely worth a watch, but what you get out of this will depend on your existing knowledge of the genre. The more you know about masked killers the more fun you'll have here. Luckily, I seem to know a lot about them, hence I had a blast with this film.",The Final Girls

26,A_Different_Drummer,best script since Pulp Fiction,9,25 October 2015,"Reviewers Notes: 1. Prior to 1994, Quentin Tarantino was actually known as ... wait for it ... Quentin Tarantino. The event that transformed him into a film icon to be forever known simply as ""QT"" was of course Pulp Fiction. The record will show, members of the jury, that Pulp was not necessarily the best acted or best produced film at the time but what it had was the best script of the era, a script so sharp you could cut yourself merely by watching the film. Scripts that good, scripts written by insiders for outsiders wanting to feel like insiders, are rare. So rare they appear about once a decade. And this is the sharp script of the present era.2. Once you grasp that the unfettered joy in watching this film is all about the script, you will appreciate that the performance of Taissa Farmiga is simply an unexpected bonus. Every film needs ""glue"" to keep both the characters and the audience grounded, and here she is the glue. But she is great glue. She has a sort of ""inner glow"" (a la early Rachel McAdams) and also a chameleon-like quality which keeps the audience interested.3. The rest of the cast is great, but really this excellent film is a showcase for the Fortin/Miller screenplay and the constantly innovative direction of Todd Strauss-Schulson. Highly recommended.",The Final Girls

They try to follow the rules in order to last till the credits role, but it's a horror film so that did not go well.The movie within a movie has all the stereotypes from the then to the now of slasher movies as the bumbling blonde, the jerk jock (but surprisingly, not the jive talking cool black dude), clashes with the pampered princess, the more sensitive athlete, and the slasher film geek as they attempt to keep Bill Murphy (A strong parody of Jason Voorhees) from slicing though their sexually active asses.

33,jtindahouse,"Fun gimmick, but not enough fun had with it",4,23 July 2016,"The slasher/horror genre is about as stale and dead (for lack of a better term) as they come. They were all the rave back in the 70s when they came on the scene, then 'Scream' threw some life back into them, and finally they became DOA. Remakes of the old classics still popped up now and then, but even those never gained much traction. So what do you do when a genre is dead? You can either refuse to touch it, or you can improvise and try to create a fun gimmicky approach to bring some freshness to the proceedings. 'The Final Girls' takes a shot at this, but makes the mistake of trying to make it almost family-friendly. This makes no sense to me. People either like horror films or they don't. There isn't a lot of middle ground. Most people avoid them like the plague, finding them a very unpleasant experience. So how did the marketing team decide to go with PG13 rating? It just killed it for all the genuine horror lovers out there who would have absolutely loved a fresh take on the genre. And the people they made it for will likely never even hear of the existence of this film, let alone see it. Very disappointing. Adam Devine is the stand-out performer in this for me. I didn't know he was in it going in, so it was a pleasant surprise when he showed up. You could tell he was improvising his lines in almost every scene, something he does very well. The rest of the cast are actually very strong as well. It's a well acted film. Sadly it's just a bit boring to put it frankly. The most entertaining part for me was probably the bloopers over the credits, and that should never be the case.",The Final Girls
34,jadavix,Pretty unentertaining,4,3 May 2019,"I'm not generally crazy about these ""meta"" parody type flicks that have characters standing outside the tropes of film genre and acknowledging them.
They are usually not any more fun than the genre flicks they're criticizing, and nor are they as intelligent as they want to appear.These movies are usually about as entertaining as watching a ""so-bad-it's-good"" flick with a pretend-intellectual type. Slasher movies are among the most clichéd film genres. It's not hard at all to point out the tropes of them. Some of the things ""The Final Girls"" makes fun of was already ridiculed, and better, in ""Scream"" almost twenty years before.""The Final Girls"" is about a group of kids who accidentally ""enter"" a slasher movie from the '80s, which couldn't be more based on ""Friday the 13th"" if it tried. They witness the events of the movie unfold right in front of them, and know how it's going to turn out, and how to survive.There is also an unnecessary subplot about the protagonist's mother playing one of the actresses in the film-within-a-film, and her using this weird experience to connect with her.I do love Taissa Farmiga, but I think this one was a dud choice for her.",The Final Girls
35,Stevieboy666,Nice idea but falls short,4,26 April 2019,"Slasher comedy/homage, a film within a film, fantasy and horror combined. Sadly it lacks what makes the things slasher movies so popular, namely gore, sex and nudity. Seemed to me that either they were aiming for a younger audience, or they just didn't have the balls to do it properly. The Jason-like killer here is called Billy Murphy, he wears one of the oddest masks that I've seen in such a movie. And talking of Jason (Friday the 13th), we keep hearing ""k k k"" whenever Billy appears, blatantly ripping off Mr Vorhees. The characters were OK, Adam Devine was funny as the obligatory horny camp counsellor. However he and others were in their 30's when they filmed this (Malin Akerman looked stunning, but playing a sweet, innocent virgin when she was 37, come on, that was stretching it!). There is s lot of mother/daughter sentimentality. fair enough, it's an important part of the movie. But for me it detracted and slowed it down.

Amanda was only remembered for that role finding it difficult to get serious work. Max is persuaded to attend a special screening of Camp Bloodbath and through a set o bizarre circumstances is catapulted into the movie along with her friends.

39,TdSmth5,Great idea ruined by PG-13 rating.,7,2 January 2016,"Nancy is an actress who gained notoriety for starring in the 80s slasher Camp Bloodbath. Now she can't find work because everyone associates her with that role. After an audition she and her daughter Max drive back. Max points out that they are in debt but Nancy just goofs off. They crash.Three years later Max is in college and we learn that Nancy died in the accident. It's the day of a double feature of Camp Bloodbath 1 and 2. One of Max's friends begs her to go and also signs her up for the Q&A. We also meet all her other ugly friends who show up for the movie. It's one of those theater were kids show up with bottles of alcohol and smoke cigarettes... That can only lead to disaster and sure enough, the theater bursts into flames. Our friends escape through the silver screen and end up...in Camp Bloodbath.At first confused, they quickly learn that they have to let the movie play out instead of interfering or trying to escape, which they can't. Max meets her teenage mom out to lose her virginity. The plot of the movie is of course that everyone who has sex dies. The virgin is the final girl and gets to kill the killer. So Max implores Nancy to keep her clothes on. Quickly they meet the killer, Billy. They think they are immune from him but one of them learns the hard way that they aren't. When the actual final girl from the movie arrives, she quickly manages to get herself killed in a car crash, that forces our gang to devise a plan to kill Billy themselves and somehow return to the real world.There's a lot to like in The Final Girls for those who enjoy slashers and 80s throwback movies. While it's never fun to see characters in a theater watching a movie, here's it's relatively short. Once they are inside the movie things are handled well. The 80s world is so stereotypical it almost seems like a criticism of the heavy reliance of 80s movies on stereotypes. A lot here is very witty and entertaining. And it's got the lovely Malin Akerman in the best role I've seen her yet where she gets to be cute and sweet. And the scenes of her singing and dancing are fantastic. Chloe Bridges is also gorgeous but gets a sorry short role, why didn't she get the lead role? That brings me to my first criticism. The bipolar casting. On the one hand the got Akerman, Briges, Dobrev, and Ludwig. But then they got the rest, a bunch of uggos starting with the lead on whose face the camera unfortunately spends endless time and in close-ups. That said everyone does a great job acting, but why settle when surely you can get a great looking cast.The second and more important problem is that this movie is PG-13, which for an 80s-inspired-and-themed slasher, is moronic and inexcusable. How many more horror movies will have to be ruined by short-sighted and incompetent executives and occasionally writer/directors? It just doesn't work. There's no nudity, gore, violence, which makes the horror aspect far less threatening and frightful. While the production apparently contributed a lot info to IMDb, notice that budget and box office info is mysteriously missing. Something tells me the whole PG-13 idea backfired. A lesson I hope they'll learn for the sequel.",The Final Girls
40,I_Ailurophile,"Phenomenal, intelligent, bloody fun",10,24 October 2021,"What a wonderful, fresh take on the slasher! The blood and gore effects look great, and the fantastical scenario lends to a great deal of clever, outrageous comedy. The core premise has been done before, sure, but not for a while, and not with this much tremendous style. 'The final girls' is outstanding!The production is full of exquisite detail in every aspect - set design and decoration, costume design, hair and makeup, special effects. The score and soundtrack is impeccable, echoing 80s classics but with a modern sensibility of sardonic wit even as it folds in atmosphere. The writing is top notch in every way - dialogue, characters, scene writing, and the overall narrative. With the smart reimagining of the genre, the characters and dialogue get to be far more robust and well-rounded than in the average slasher (especially those from the 80s, as cheekily represented here). Every scene is orchestrated to perfection, with marvelous camerawork, lighting, and a phenomenal soundtrack. And the narrative as a whole is flush with not just comedy and violence, but meaningful tension and suspense, and even some genuine emotional weight. For all the elements included here, the writing is so strong that everything is woven in organically, and even with a measure of pointed cinematic cheese on top, nothing feels forced or heavy-handed.Everyone in the cast has handily proven their worth in the past, but even if they hadn't, I think this alone would stand as a fine testament to their capabilities. Alia Shawkat, Angela Trimbur, Nina Dobrev, Alexander Ludwig, Tory N. Thompson, Thomas Middleditch, Adam Devine, Malin Akerman, Taissa Farmiga - all involved lean into the roles they've been given. Yet at the same time that everyone has a distinct personality (especially the characters in 'Camp Bloodbath'), the parts are written with such laxity as to allow the actors to embrace and explore them with all the flair they deem fit. Why, for all the wild portrayals I've seen Trimbur give at one time or another, she inhabits ""Tina"" so completely as to make this worth watching all by herself. But then, that's effectively true for everybody - every performance is superb.I had high expectations to begin, and still I'm blown away. In writing and execution alike, in the careful consideration of every aspect, this is so brilliant, and extraordinarily well made. It covers a range of moods with natural ease, while never losing sight of its prime directive of pure entertainment. There's little more to be said: If anything I've described sounds like a feature you might enjoy, then you need to watch this immediately. 'The final girls' is a genius horror-comedy, and a must-see, and that's all there is to it.",The Final Girls

I'm a big fan of survivalist situations (realistic or not), and have been waiting to find a ""trapped in a movie"", as opposed to ""trapped in a video game"" for some time now.While my expectations were a bit high, I think the cast helped even me out some.

Thomas Middleditch ""Silicone Valley""
Malin Akerman ""Watchmen""
Adam Devine ""Pitch Perfect""
Alia Shawkat ""Arrested Development""
Chloe Bridges ""Pretty Little Liars""Most of which I'm not actually a big fan, but Taissa Farmiga ended up carrying most of the movie anyways.Given that they're trapped in a slasher movie, we have to deal with several cliches, and SO MUCH meta discussion that is literally takes over the movie at certain point, but that is part of the survival strategies. We also get some pretty interesting death scenes, along with some that are more comedic than interesting.Surprisingly, the movie is actually both too formulaic and unique to discuss much without spoilers, so I'll just say any slasher fan that enjoys discussion about slasher movies is going to like this one.",The Final Girls
42,Matt_Layden,So much more potential...,7,5 November 2015,"This film has one hell of a premise that immediately grabbed my attention. It features the exact blend of comedy and horror that I love and that so rarely filmmakers do right. The severely underrated Club Dread is a perfect example of how so many people can miss the intended humour. Then you have hits like Tucker & Dale vs Evil, which not only is a great premise, but is also both hilarious and a bloody good time. People either seem to love or hate these films and it's most likely because it's so hard to balance the two genres. When done right, it's gold, when done wrong, it's terrible. The Final Girls, for the most part, lands on the good side of the spectrum. Max, loses her mother in a car accident and 3 years to the day, is invited to a screening of her late mother's most famous film, a cheesy 80's horror flick called Camp Blood. During the screening the theatre catches fire, so Max and her friends have to escape and cut right through the theatre screen. Next thing they know, they're in the movie. The exact same movie her mother appears in, which now gives Max a second opportunity to be with her mother, only if she survives the deranged killer roaming the woods. The film has a great opportunity to capitalize on a lot of horror clichés, much like the way The Cabin in the Woods did brilliantly. One character in particular, a Randy Meeks of horror films, is the perfect opportunity to connect the film characters with the viewer at home. What would Randy do if he were literally transported into the film Scream? This was an interesting approach that I hoped the filmmakers would take. They don't. They kind of walk the line, but they are pretty inconsistent with things. Being in the horror film and knowing how it ends is perfect fodder for comedy gold. The film did make me laugh, many times, but I wanted to laughs to be really enjoyable. Instead I chuckled a lot throughout the film. Instead of being a comedy, the film has a surprising amount of drama thrown in. Max has an opportunity to reunite with her mother, only the person in the movie isn't her mother, she's the character her mother plays in the film. Again, great set ups for comedy gold, yet we get mild humour. I little disappointing on that end, but still enough comedy in the film to make me smile. The filmmakers throw some interesting aspects of the genre at the viewers and the characters. The characters can actually hear the ""ch ch ch cha cha cha"" that accompanies a nearby victim or a flashback that transports the character even further back in time. Title cards that they can interact with, a specific time line of events to unfold. Every 92 minutes, things start over again because that is the length of the film. These things are clever and make for a unique viewing experience. One of the biggest problems with the film is that it doesn't go far enough with the material. It's held back by the rating. The film features very little gore and no nudity. These things are staples of the horror genre, especially the 80's slasher films that the film is parodying. If the film has embraced these things and given us an R rated comedy, then it would have been a lot better. It felt restrained in a sense. Not a wasted opportunity, not at all. The film is good and those who enjoy these types of movies will surely have a good time. I just think the possibilities could have been so much more. They had a great idea and didn't try and take it any further beyond that. This film easily, could have been one of my favourites of the year, instead it settles for being just a good movie. If you ever sat down and thought to yourself, Pleasantville as a horror film would be brilliant. This film is for you.",The Final Girls
43,brando647,"Not That Scary, Not That Funny...",6,24 April 2016,"I got the impression that THE FINAL GIRLS was advertised as a horror/comedy satirizing tropes from the early generation of slasher films from the 80's. And it was, to an extent, but it's mostly the heartfelt tale of a daughter mourning the loss of her mother and learning to let her go. That would've been good to know because I went in with a particular expectation that was let down pretty thoroughly. The mother/daughter team at the core of THE FINAL GIRLS is Malin Akerman and Taissa Farmiga. Amanda (Akerman) was a struggling actress who's one big hit was the cult classic slasher film CAMP BLOODBATH from the mid 80's, a Friday THE 13TH sort of horror film where she was a shy camp counselor who was hacked to bits by the machete-wielding maniac Billy Murphy (Dan B. Norris) after losing her virginity. Amanda dies in a car crash and her daughter Max (Farmiga) is still having problems coping three years later. When she's invited to a double-feature screening of CAMP BLOODBATH and its sequel as a special guest on the anniversary of her mother's death, she reluctantly agrees. Things get weird when a series of freak occurrences cause a fire in the theater and Max and her friends are forced to escape through the screen, finding themselves awakening moments later in the film. Trapped at Camp Blue Finch with a bunch of horny counselors and a murderous psychopath on the loose, Max and her friends must convince the film's characters of the danger they're in and devise a plan to escape back to the real world. Of course, it's made all the more difficult for Max when she comes face-to-face with her ""mother"" in the character of Nancy, the shy counselor with a guitar who's doomed to become a victim.THE FINAL GIRLS might be better than I'm giving it credit for but I was personally disappointed in the end result. I sat down expecting something more along the lines of TUCKER AND DALE VS. EVIL with a focus on lampooning the clichéd elements of the Jason Voorhees franchise. THE FINAL GIRLS does this and, when it does, the movie is pretty fun. But, and I hate to sound cold-hearted, whenever the movie focuses on the mother/daughter angle, I get bored. It's disappointing enough that the movie is PG-13 so we get none of the bloody violence and gratuitous nudity associated with the slasher films it's poking fun at, but to then constantly downshift the pace to accommodate the Max/Nancy plot thread is rough. We kept injecting these heartwarming moments with Max assuming the more parental role for the eager-to-get-busy Nancy as she tries to keep the clueless teenaged counselor's clothes on, educating her on the fact that she doesn't have to sleep with the lecherous Kurt (Adam DeVine) just because he wants it. Look, the Akerman/Farmiga stuff works really well. Both of these women are great actresses and they've got some excellent chemistry here as mother and daughter (or ""camp friends""), but it feels like we're bouncing between two separate movies and I found it increasingly annoying. Between the movie's heart, the toothless horror elements, and the hit-or-miss comedy, THE FINAL GIRLS only worked on the one level (Akerman/Farmiga) and everything else suffered. It wasn't nearly suspenseful enough to qualify as any sort of horror movie. The kills were mostly tame (with two exceptionsone involve a car and the other a bear trap) and Billy Murphythe Jason Voorhees stand-in wasn't all that scary with his big ol' tiki mask looking like something out of the Scooby-Doo movie. The comedy fared a little better but it still came up short.THE FINAL GIRLS never elicited more than a half-hearted chuckle out of me but what comic relief we were provided helped the movie pass a little smoother. The supporting cast includes Thomas Middleditch (from the fantastic HBO show ""Silicon Valley"") as the resident CAMP BLOODBATH super-fan Duncan, Adam DeVine (form Comedy Central's ""Workaholics"") as the camp's sex-obsessed jock Kurt, and Angela Trimbur as the horniest counselor of the bunch, Tina. The three of them provide the funniest moments of the movie and almost every scene with them (especially Middleditch and Trimbur) is great. I also loved how the filmmakers created the world of the movie-within-a-movie. Once Max and her friends are dumped into the world of CAMP BLOODBATH, they're trapped and any attempt to escape circles right back around to the camp. On-screen title cards are physical three- dimensional objects that they can interact with, and flashbacks are a trippy journey into the black-and-white world of the late 50's. Even with the toned- down PG-13, I could've loved this film purely for the creativity involved if we'd gone the comedic route, spending more time building laughs on the inherent goofiness of slasher films viewed through modern cynical eyes. Or we could've gone the other direction and taken a hard R-rating with the horror angle. Either way I feel we still could've found a way to incorporate the very personal tale of Max and Nancy, and then we'd have had more fun in the meantime. But it is what it is, and THE FINAL GIRLS is a decent 90 minute distraction but little more for me.",The Final Girls
44,begob,Better than Cabin In The Woods,7,12 October 2015,"A girl mourning her actress-mother's death is persuaded to watch a screening of her mother's first role in an old slasher flick, when the theatre catches fire and she leads her friends through a slash in the cinema screen. But is she leading them to safety? Clever and lots of fun. What struck me first was the cinematography, which adds great energy to the story, and even visual jokes through over-exposures here and there and real life slow motion. The performances are good, and every character is well judged and sympathetic. The messing about with genre rules is coherent, so it's in the same area as The Cabin In The Woods - and I think it even outshines that movie with a great gag at the end. Even the out-takes over the end credits are good.The only drawback is that it loses a little pace in the middle, with too much talking and exposition, and keeps true to the Josh Wheedon style as the Buffy perkiness unfolds in the climax. Not to my taste, and I wish they could include some of the mean spiritedness of the genre within this fantasy world. As it is, no scene is actually horrifying, and they even went all respectable on the sex.The music is fun, and there are nice jokes in the sound effects.Overall, good hearted and clever parody, but not enough slashing.ps. There's a joke in the credits to Camp Bloodbath, but I'd have to go back and see it again.",The Final Girls
45,denis888,"Hilarious, Fresh, Very Clver And Witty",9,29 April 2018,"It is not that easy to make a movie which is a decent comedy, even more demanding to make a slashe comedy. The Final Girls did that surpsingly well, veery merrily and wth a certain baravado and gusto. Great casting adds a certain flavor, with Taissa Farniga being the spellbinding lead role, fully growing from a timid girl to a valiant fighter.
What makes the movie really strong is that healthy dose of irony, self-mockery, obvious pun, and a great sense of humor.
Laura Kern of Film Comment called the film a ""sharp, wickedly funny, and unexpectedly heartfelt homage"" to slasher films, adding, ""It's a gimmicky premise, perhaps, but a highly effective one. No mere meta-exercise, the film innovatively blends the worlds of the 1986 teens of Camp Bloodbath with the modern-day ones.""
Not much can be added here.",The Final Girls

47,gedikreverdi,Millennial counselors in an '80s campsite,7,2 August 2021,"I'm in love with slashers so it was crystal clear that I'd love this film as I do now. It's a very unique and different take. Max (Taissa Farmiha whom I'm not a huge fan of) and her mother had an accident and her mother died. She was an actor and starred in a slasher flick back in '80s and it's named as Bloodbath Camp. On the third anniversary of death of her mother, they were watching that slasher with some horror movie nerds. There was a fire in the theater and they found themselves in the movie itself when they tore the white screen and passed thru it. Duncan the slasher nerd who'd want to be a final girl was the star of the film for me. He was extremely hilarious and he acted so well. Vicky the mean girl, Kurt the insatiable guy with a big bulge and Tina the dumb one were all interesting and hilarious characters, too. They lured Billy the killer by getting naked and tried to kill him with some Scooby-Doo. When Nancy started telling the backstory of Bill, they got back in time and when she finished it, they moved forward. It didn't work and Nancy, Max's mother, sacrificed herself so that her daughter could become the final girl. The church under the stormy clouds scene was amazing. She lured the killer by getting naked and dancing. And then Max became the final virgin girl standing and she and the killer fought with their machetes and Max chopped his head off. And the end credits started rolling and all of them found themselves in a hospital in the sequel. I felt weird seeing how much of a different species we've become with those people that just lived a few decades ago. IPhones, online shipping, antidepressants... It was a really good watch and I'm glad they didn't shoot a sequel to this because that's not a typical slasher.",The Final Girls
48,brchthethird,Would make an interesting double-bill with CABIN IN THE WOODS,7,1 November 2015,"I was looking for an entertaining film to watch on Halloween, and I sure wasn't disappointed with THE FINAL GIRLS. The basic premise is that a group of friends at a horror marathon end up getting trapped in the movie itself and have to find a way to survive. Brilliant, right? Arguably the best part of the movie is the way that it makes fun of horror clichés, particularly those in the slasher genre. They also poke fun at the horrible writing and bad acting. Basically, it does for slasher films what CABIN IN THE WOODS did for ""cabin in the woods""/Evil Dead-type films. The acting, even though some of it was intentionally bad, was decent. There weren't too many well-known actors, so nobody really stood out in that respect. I did recognize Taissa Farmiga and Malin Akerman, and for what it's worth, they did well. However, my favorite character was the dumb blonde. She provided the most laughs for me. Adam Devine was OK, but it reminded me too much of his work in PITCH PERFECT. From a technical standpoint, everything was rather solid. Camera-work was good, and I thought they did a good job toning down R-rated violence for a PG-13. They even get a good joke out of using black-and-white for a flashback sequence. All things considered, THE FINAL GIRLS was a clever genre sendup that makes mostly good use out of the material its parodying. To sweeten it further, there were a couple of scenes that seemed stolen from my dreams, as Taissa Farmiga's character and I have something in common that I won't spoil for those who haven't seen the film. Let's just say there was one part that got me a little emotional. The only thing that keeps me from going higher with the rating is that the film kind of backs off from a ""your destiny is up to you"" message and falls back on the clichés it had been making fun of up to that point. Other than that, I thought it was an easy watch with plenty of laughs that should entertain most viewers who are into horror movies.",The Final Girls
49,blott2319-1,"Neat idea, until they change the idea...",5,24 June 2020,"I'm all for movies that go meta, in fact many of the horror films I actually enjoy are those that take a knowing look at the inherent flaws in the genre. The Final Girls is a unique one because it cranks the self-referential nature up to a level where the characters might as well be winking directly at the camera. The mere idea of real-life people walking into a movie is something that's been done before, but I think it is a cool way of looking at the stark contrast between reality and the movies. I enjoyed this aspect of the film, and definitely got some chuckles out of the way they handled some of the goofy things we all know from other horror films. I got the impression that Camp Bloodbath was most closely mimicking Friday the 13th, which is one of the classic horror films I haven't seen. As a result, there's a chance I missed some of the references, but I still felt like I was ""in on the joke."" It's not so specific to that one film that it alienates all people who aren't fans of it.I think where The Final Girls falls short is that it kind of loses track of what it wants to be. At first I was all-in on the idea that these kids were going to be first-hand observers of Camp Bloodbath, who had to watch but could do nothing to stop it, yet they'd have one of their group who desperately wants to deviate from the script. However, they turn away from that idea and make the kids part of the movie themselves, now having to deal with the fact that they might have changed things beyond repair. This was also an intriguing idea, because it felt like they could take a wiser path to fixing their fate, since they had some knowledge of how horror movies work. Then the movie kind of devolved and became more of a traditional horror film, and took away most of the cooler twists they established up to that point. The Final Girls is a movie that needed a bit more thought and perhaps a couple more drafts of the script to elevate it from something that is decent to something that could be really good or even great.",The Final Girls
50,IonicBreezeMachine,"A bit of Pleasantville, some Scream, and some Last Action Hero for kick.",8,25 May 2020,"The Final Girls is very humorous horror comedy that although it shys away too much for the edgier subject matter(PG-13 and all), it does manage to work due to it's humor, it's cast, and a very sweet mother/daughter story. Max Cartwright still grieving over her recently deceased 80's scream queen mother Amanda is talked into attending a revival of her mother's iconic slasher film Camp Bloodbath. However a fire erupts in the theater and through magic I guess, Amanda and friends find themselves inside the movie complete with exaggerated slasher movie cannon fodder. The movie has fun with modern day teens interacting with 80's horror movie caricatures including casual sexism and homophobia dropped by the dumb jock stereotype and the portrait portrayed here isn't too far from the one used in Pleasantville. Sam has some absolutely heart wrenching moments interacting with the character played by her mother and it's that emotional core that elevates this beyond a spoof movie. To say anything more would be to give too much away, so go see it. But be advised this is first and foremost 80% comedy maybe 20% horror. It's not played the same way as Tucker & Dale vs. Evil or Cabin in the Woods so judge it on its own merits and you'll find something special.",The Final Girls
51,thekarmicnomad,"Despite its retro theme; a very fresh, vibrant, clever movie.",9,24 February 2016,"This is my hidden gem for the year so far.First things first, this film is not hilariously funny and it is not gut wrenchingly scary either. It is however very humorous, very clever and great fun. It manages to satire (spoof isn't quite the right word) 80s slasher movies without being overly mean or critical of them. The title of the movie references the final surviving girl who always finishes of the killer. The modern female characters are in stark contrast to their 80's counter parts. This is all done in a very clever way, refraining from beating you about the head with the feminist stick.The ""scream"" type rules are served up again (the final girl is always a propitious virgin, etc.) but in a fresh and interesting way.I loved this. You essentially get three films: a very slick, dry comedy wrapped in a stupid 80's slasher movie, wrapped inside a touching character piece.Production, direction, even effects are great and used effectively! The cast is a shot gun blast of television drama, sit com and Sci-Fi series talent.",The Final Girls
52,one9eighty,They won't be singing Kumbaya... they'll be screaming Kumba-no!,7,26 August 2020,"Grieving the loss of her mother Amanda Cartwright (Malin Akerman), a one-time horror scream queen, young girl Max Cartwright (Taissa Farmiga) is thrown into the film that made her mother famous, the 80's slasher flick, ""Camp Bloodbath"". Very a-kin to ""Friday the 13th"", a slasher/serial kill is on the loose murdering the kids. Billy Murphy (Daniel Norris) was teased to death by the camp mates and wants his bloody revenge. Max and her friends (Alia Shawkat, Alexander Ludwig, Thomas Middleditch and Nina Dobrev) must work with the camp mates to try and survive.I was dubious about this film when I read the summary. Not only was it littered with 'kids', it was also on a cable channel which is not known for quality films. I watched it all the same and was pleasantly surprised at it. It is a weird re-hash, parody, and homage all in one. It was like ""Scream"" (1996) the way it knew it's content, crossed with ""The Last Action Hero"" (1993) the way it poked fun at itself, and ""Cabin in the Woods"" (2011) the way it developed - but just a little cuter, colourful and fluffier. It does not take itself too seriously, nor the genre that it is working with, nor the era that the 'original' movie was set in. There are times where it is cheesy and camp, there are times where it looks cheap - but all in all it works. Plenty of clichés and standard slasher tropes but used well to get the plot across rather than thrown in just to use them. I would not necessarily say that this film is scary, more an adventure film set in a horror film. I imagine it's kind of like what would happen if the current MTV generation took a virtual tour of an 80's slasher/horror film. There is nothing too offensive, plenty of suggestion rather than action, a little bit of bad language, very mild drink and drugs use, nudity and some violence and gore (but used as much in comedy as in horror).While this film was pleasantly surprising and nice, it's the kind of film I could most of the family in front of, whereas, personally, I prefer the kind of films you can't safely put family members in front of for fear of offending them. Give me ""Friday the 13th"" (1980), ""The Burning"" (1981), ""Sleepaway Camp"" (1983), or even ""Cheerleader Camp"" (1988). But still, this was a lighthearted way to reminisce, it was fun, and at 91 mins it was easy to sit through. Released in 2015 with a relatively low budget of $4.5 million, I am sure you will catch this film repeated on cable channels in the future, so I say, why not give it a go.

53,ASouthernHorrorFan,"My Review Of ""The Final Girls""",8,12 October 2015,"To be honest I tried so hard not to like this film. Well not at first, at first I thought ""cool another HORROR COMEDY"", but then when it started and I glimpsed the set-up I really felt that I was not gonna like this film. At first I thought the introduction to the protagonists was hokey, then when we see how the story comes about with the cast entering the fictional film playing at the theatre I thought-""WTF? Am I suppose to buy this?"". It was a bit of an issue with me, eating at me through pretty much the whole film-I really wanted to know the ""HOW"". Oh well, that being said, Schulson's creativity, and fresh spin on the horror spoof is so well executed that I couldn't help but enjoy the ride. The character contrast between our ""real cast"" and the ""fictional cast"" is so entertaining, especially with the comedy side of ""The Final Girls"". The cliché horror stereotypes meeting the somewhat ""real world"" cliché characters captured my attention. The seasoned acting between the up-and-coming Hollywood stars and the star- wattage of seasoned stars like Malin Akerman and Nina Dobrev is pure candy. The real star in this film is the script! The writing is just so good that even the things that irritated me, held my attention. The scenes are so emotional, dark, humorous, and visual - just perfectly done. Kudos to the crew and cast of ""The Final Girls"" on all that! The special effects were ""Hollywood"". What can you say, the practical effects, make-up skill, and CGI are so well produced that you get both a indie slasher homage, and total 80's popcorn effect. The CGI is done in a way that makes it as enjoyable as the splatter gore practical effects-that is a big ""yay"" for me because CGI tends to be a bummer personally when watching horror films. This time it all just worked perfectly. The soundtrack is methodical and precise. It plays on 80 slasher nostalgia and really connects you to the atmosphere of the scenes-both the campy ""characters in a fictional horror film and knowing it"" aspect, and the actual intimate, emotional relationship scenes that really develop the characters. Overall ""The Final Girls"" really comes close to hitting on all cylinders as the perfect slasher spoof. There is still that annoying ""HOW"" that lingers through the film, the almost too obvious and expected ""Hallmarky"" moments, and the fact that you pretty much know exactly how the scenes are gonna play out, and the general reaction from the characters, because it has to play out that way because it was set up to play out that way. Still the masterful way that Todd Strauss-Schulson pulls all the sweet and savory horror, and comedy stuff together in a visually delightful film- and don't forget the writing and cast- all just make ""The Final Girls"" a really fun and awesome viewing experience that fans should really enjoy!",The Final Girls

55,witster18,"Well, it's definitely better than 'Final Girl'.",6,9 November 2015,"This is admittedly right up my alley. I love horror flicks. I love horror comedies, and like satire/self-aware vehicles like this too. This is kinda like you mixed ""Cabin in the Woods - 6"", ""Deathproof -8"", ""Detention - 6.5"", and ""Tucker and Dale vs. Evil- 6"". I dunno if it's as good as any of those. Maybe as good as the latter. Final Girl is quite clever in concept, average in execution(in that way a lot like Cabin in the Woods). I think the film's greatest asset is the idea of it all, but the comedy is a close second. Not necessarily laugh-out loud funny, but it does put many a smile on your face. The outtakes are great too. Definitely not to be taken too seriously, and that's not necessarily a bad thing at all. The visuals are hit and miss. The cgi in an early, more serious scene is a little schotty, but at other times later in the film, there's some decent style/direction points for art design. If you like the genre's I mentioned, or if you just go into this with the right open mind and mild expectations - you'll like it. 62/100.. Rt now sitting as my 21rst fave of 2015, but I'm only 45/82 thru my watchlist. Very good concept. The concept came together nicely, but writing could be even wittier, and some of the gore/horror aspect would have benefited from an ""R"" rating. That idea was a mistake. Not like it mattered at the box office. I would have like to seen an Adam Green hard-R version of this. Marginal recommendation.You'll like this if you liked the film's mentioned above.. Or ""Behind the Mask:The Rise of Leslie Vernon 8/10""which is probably the benchmark for this type of flick.",The Final Girls

The story has a really cool concept with the cast getting sucked into the movie and the two different generations of teens interacting with each other, which was really fun and really boasts some interesting contrasts. Plus there were a surprising amount of emotional scenes in this movie, which made for a nice change and they totally worked, which was thanks to the strong cast of actors which really adds depth to this and made for an unexpected but welcome change.Even by technical stand point this movie has some of the best cinematography that I've seen in a while, with some amazing camera work that you don't usually see in these types of movies. Even the lighting was fantastic which really helps set the mood for the movie, with the mixtures of colours that reflect the situations in each scene, which I thought was interesting and worked really well in the movie's favour. The style of horror mixed with comedy really balances out quite well and you can tell that the cast was having a blast and especially at pointing out the horror movie clichés and just running with them.The acting was fantastic with some real strong female leads with Taissa Farmiga who I'd loved on American Horror Story and was equally as great here, she was definitely up to the task and becomes a total bad-ass towards the end and it was nice to see her do something different, definitely a talent to be watched. Malin Ackerman who played her mother was also great their mother daughter relationship really worked well and they had great chemistry together which was the emotional backbone of this movie. Alexander Ludwig was really likable as the boyfriend and male lead. Adam Devine was hilarious and was a definite standout, but wasn't in it long enough. Finally Thomas Middleditch was great as the horror fan boy and made for a great comic relief. In fact the entire cast gave decent and well rounded performances.Although there are a few minor bad points to this though, such as the pacing towards the end was very slow and did kind of sag in places, while I get they were building up suspense for the last act, but it did just go on a bit too long and could have maybe been trimmed down a tad. Plus because of the rating of this movie did feel watered down as we didn't get any gruesome death scenes which for a slasher movie isn't a great thing, and that also meant that none of the death scenes really stood out, but thankfully the movie doesn't suffer too much because of this and it's still an entertaining watch.All in all 'The Final Girls' is a fantastic movie with a great script, strong acting and witty and sharp dialogue and just a general great time. While it may not deliver on the gore, and the emotional scenes may not be for everyone, this movie definitely delivers on everything else and deserves to be a classic.",The Final Girls

They are then pursued by the murderer of said movie and have to use their knowledge of old slasher movies to survive. There were a handful of things that I liked about this movie. There was a scene at the beginning involving the way a building got lit on fire that was shot in a pretty cool way, and there were a handful of good ideas that I think would be funny on paper, such as the end scene of the movie. While the movie is funny on paper, is it actually funny as a movie? Not really. At least I didn't think it was. During a handful of scenes I thought ""Oh, that's funny"" but I never actually laughed. The humor wasn't particularly clever either until the last 20 seconds or so, which was unfortunate. I found that the movie was often inconsistent or just didn't make a whole lot of sense. Characters did and knew things without an explanation as to how they did. Sure, you kind of figure out how what they were doing works on your own, but how the characters knew was the real mystery. People praised this movie for having 'genuine heart', but I really didn't think it did. Maybe as far as slasher movies go it did, but as a movie it didn't. The 'genuine heart' was simply done through clichéd and awkward 'I love you and I'm going to keep you with me forever' scenes that I really don't think anyone wanted. Or at least I didn't. Overall The Final Girls is okay. While I have my own complaints about the movie, it was still a mostly fun and enjoyable film. As a comedy I'd say it failed, but there were some good ideas at least.

59,johannes2000-1,"An unexpected and very original surprise, absolutely great!!",9,12 July 2018,"I really had a ball with this one! And I didn't even see it coming, I seriously thought (on reading the cover of the dvd) that it was going to be yet another old-fashioned summer-camp slasher movie. Well, in many ways it was, but with a very special and original twist, and that is an achievement in itself in this pretty worn-out genre. There are two ways you can look at this movie: as a retro horror flick in its own right; or as a persiflage on the genre itself, something like the Scream-series was. In my opinion it succeeded in every aspect. As a horror-flick it had a good pace and was fairly exciting with decent scares and some (but not over the top) gore. And as a persiflage it just kept me laughing and smiling all movie long, it just was SO funny and kept hitting the nails on the heads of all the quintessential and at many times silly aspects of the genre. So kudos for the writers and the director, they did a great job!Traditionally in this kind of movie the actors aren't really heavy-weights, but here most of them are pretty good. Taissa Farmiga as the heroine (""the final girl"") is as endearing as her mother Malin Akerman; love-interest Alexander Ludwig is cute as a puppy; Nina Dobrev is a beauty and a natural actress; and horror-nerd Thomas Middleditch is very funny. And I especially want to mention Adam Devine as the retro jock, he is absolutely hilarious!!Photography and direction are great, there are so many intelligent and original inventions: the over-saturated colours of the movie-in-the-movie, the sudden use of black-and-white, the opening and closing credits that are made physical part of the surroundings, the slow-motion effects, it's all smartly done but never too much in your face or forced, always tongue in cheek.If you want to enjoy an old-fashioned slasher but this time with a really original twist, go for this, you will not be disappointed.",The Final Girls
60,ArchonCinemaReviews,"Fiendishly original and insanely entertaining, loved it!",8,27 October 2015,"In a horror movie, there is only one person to be, the final girl, and if you and your friends are trapped in an 80's slasher flick that won't let you leave, you stick by that girl even if your mom is in the film.The whole premise is for The Final Girls is incredibly original, to the point where we almost can't believe that no one thought of it until now. Then again, the basic premise is that a daughter of a has-been B-movie actress who died gets sucked into the film she couldn't live down called Camp Bloodbath, which happens to be a campy slasher horror. Why would anyone come up with that?The Final Girls is one of those weird films that is a satire but it takes its portrayal of the parent material very seriously. Evident in the script written by M.A. Fortin and Joshua John Miller is a supreme appreciation of the slasher genre, especially Friday the 13th. At no point does The Final Girls come across as overly critical or bashing of the genre, it is in fact the sincerest homage and nod of respect to the movie type.As a piece of cinema, The Final Girls screams California made, crafted by those aspiring industry professionals who claim to understand the art. And while the director Todd Strauss-Schulson nails the campy 80's vibe, his basic grasp of editing leaves something to be desired. Several times through out the film, a loop or joke lasts a beat too long where your interest starts to wane. This doesn't happen often, maybe three or four times throughout the film, but enough to become distracting.Those minor hiccups in The Final Girls' execution are all but forgotten thanks to the killer cast led by Taissa Farmiga. Seriously, there are so many friendly faces in this film, it makes you wonder if other indie films would've done better if they lucked out with a cast like this. Each actor brings life to the character that might otherwise be a hollow trope. Then there are the actors playing the beloved camp counselors who are unaware that they are just movie characters from Camp Bloodbath. Adam DeVine and Angela Trimbur steal the show, and are so poignantly hilarious that every scene involving them springs to life.The Final Girls has a little bit of everything for everyone, it has gore and camp for B-movie aficionados, it has a story for narrative sticklers, it has laughs for those that have to have comedy.

61,hellholehorror,Trope,5,8 October 2021,This clever horror comedy is well paced and engrossing with an interesting but totally ridiculous story. Acting is brilliant with Adam Devine and the horror movie nerd being the most memorable. The relationship between the 'final girl' and her mother drives the story and their relationship is warming. The slasher tropes will appeal to a viewer of a certain age and will probably be lost on younger viewers although they will hopefully enjoy the comedy. This is good and very much reminiscent of Happy Death Day (2017) and Tucker and Dale vs Evil (2010) but sadly not as entertaining or memorable.,The Final Girls

64,skybrick736,The Final Girls (8/10),8,16 December 2015,"Taissa Farmiga is quickly becoming a notable horror scream queen with a stunning on screen presence, known for her main role in the first season of American Horror Story and now the impressive horror/comedy, The Final Girls. Taissa does a great job being the sad out-casted teenager and allows for more colorful characters either comedic or dramatic to be filled in around her. The Final Girls did that, outlining a great set of characters and finding the right people to play those roles. Adam DeVine, known for his outrageousness in Workaholics, brings his giant, hilarious personality to frame, where at times nearly steals the entire show with his eccentric alpha role. Besides the characters though, The Final Girls is also completely original, being a parody of the old 1980's campy slasher films that were idolized in that decade. The film did have some missing elements but otherwise is a great watch with not a single dull moment.",The Final Girls

I'll say some stuff.The Final Girls is entertaining from the very first frame. Just a fun ride from start to finish. It is very well made, there is a ton of well known faces. (at least for most of us) The atmosphere is just aces! So good. So nice and cozy.It's one part Friday the 13th, one part Last Action Hero, and that's a fun little mix I'll tell ya! It's a feel-good-slasher.It's very visually appealing, and you really get the feeling that you are in a movie. Well, that they are in a movie. That you are in a movie in a movie, with them. You see what I'm saying? And here is one thing that sets The Final Girls apart from a lot of other slashers and horror-comedies: It has heart. A good chunk too. And good acting. There is this one scene in slo-mo - So cool! Just wanted to say it. No reason.The only thing that could have made it better would be, of course, gore and blood. For some reason it's PG13, so we get little blood, no nudity and no swearing. But it still manages to be entertaining as hell, and that's saying something. (If we are real nice, maybe Santa will bring us an unrated version?)So, do I have to say more now? Huh? Go watch it!",The Final Girls
66,President_George_Washington,FROM THE DESK OF GEORGE WASHINGTON,5,30 May 2021,"Cheerio from my local.Amusing that failed actress and single mom, Nancy, lists a small CSI character arch in her bio pic/page. It's a well-established fact that every struggling actor has a CSI: ANY VERSION credit to their name. It's one of the easiest acting jobs to get and the joke was a good. The rest of the movie is reasonably entertaining...but not as clever it thinks it is.If you liked the meta style of Scream, then you'll probably enjoy the effort here. Whereas Scream explored all the tropes (or least many of them), The Final Girls focuses nearly all its energy on one...the Final Girl, with a nod to the atypical Camp Teen Death and a near supernatural killer with a horrific backstory.The setup: Our modern day ""teens"" get sucked into a classic 80's slasher flick. The magic of the ""How"" isn't explored...you just have to accept it. Once inside the alternate universe, they quickly meet the movie's Camp Councilors on the way to camp in a van. They slow down and ask the bewildered group if they'd like a ride. They decline and 92 minutes later, the same van pulls up and they again ask the group the same question. Again, they decline and again 92 minutes later...same thing.They quickly figure out that movie is restarting and hop in, believing they'll need to do that much in order to return to the real world.It's a cool Groundhog Day set-up. Too bad they ignored it immediately. Once in camp, time only recycles one time for a random flashback sequence necessary to exposition to the plot. I found this annoying and a missed opportunity to tell a better story. It would have been more entertaining to watch them collectively learn more about their environment. Additionally, the movie characters act exactly the way they are supposed to...that is, they follow the script. Again, like the time loop, they mostly abandon their pre-programmed character arch and act independently. Not completely, the ""loose"" girl, whose only job is to expose herself and get killed, is quite funny in this.Alternately, one of the modern teens, nerd Duncan, confronts the killer and explains to the others that he's safe. He does this knowing the killer is behind him, classically, he doesn't turn around...and you can guess the result. Wish the film had more of that. Classic trope.Those complaints aside, the film really bogs down with the mother, daughter issues. It's way too somber and the ""touching"" moments feel out of place. Also, Adam Devin's comedy style is definitely an acquired taste, but here he's funny and his death scene is amusing. The ending is a cheap joke, but by then, it won't matter. The movie starts one way and ends on radically different tone.Be sure to sit through the blooper reel. Everyone with a speaking part gets a shout out...all, except the black guy. Intentional or not...hilarious.Cheers.",The Final Girls
67,jayjaycee,Ki ki ki kind of surprisingly funny,6,24 February 2020,"""The Final Girls"" is a 2015 horror comedy directed by Todd Strauss-Schulsson starring Taissa Farmiga and Malin Ackerman. The sub-genre of slasher films is one of the most popular among horror fans and especially teenagers. While they seem to all follow the same plot pattern, there are some titles that still stand out and are still being watched today. From Leatherface, over Michael Myers to Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorheese, they all brought up famous movie monsters that are now icons of the new age of horror. Of course the success of one sparked a number of copycat or sequels to be produced, but that's the principal of the genre. Trashy sequels were inevitable. All of them are full of clichés and stereotypes, that's why you either love it or hate it. Embrace the cheesyness or watch something else. In my personal opinion, the films range from masterpieces to absolute trash.
While ""Halloween"" ranks among my favourite films of all time, ""Friday The 13th"" is one of dumbest films I've ever seen. So, I when I coincidentally watched the trailer for this mockery, I was pleased that I found a comedy that also realized the hilariousness behind the 1980 slasher. The idea behind this flick might originated from a absurd concept, but was an idea absolutely needed in the genre. It's an absolutely colorful fun flick that piece by piece mocks the clichés and stereotypes of a slasher film. Centered around a group of friends who were miraculously sucked into the most obvious rip off of the Crystal Lake saga, the madness begins to develop more and more. To be honest, the characters, especially Farmiga's Max were surprisingly highly sympathic and it was a great fun to watch them trying to survive on screen. Their acting was decent in the concept of a b-movie and I couldn't stop laughing at the performances of the movie cast. The acting is absolutely terrible, but it's so funny, because it's absolutely intentional. Adam Devine might be the peak of it and I'm still wondering why he was the funniest in the bloopers. The film is aware of it's cheap nature and doesn't try to reach anything higher and that's it's biggest advantage. From black and white flashbacks to terrible dialogue it offers all of it. It's just surprising that the film relinquishes the depictions of explicit nudity and gory violence, as it could have made more jokes on cost of those aspects. If there's one thing that disturbed the pleasure of watching it, then it's the horrible visual effects. Some were even tolerable remembering that it's a low budget film, but that car crash scene stabbed my eyes deeper than any knife used in the film. Another welcome surprise of this film is the interwoven mother-daughter and loss subplot that worked out pretty well thanks to the chemistry between Farmiga and Ackerman. It seriously grabbed me more than expected and gave it a whole dimension to it. All in all, this fun flick is a surprisingly entertaining spoof on the slasher genre that manages to reach its goal, thanks to loveable protagonists, experimental camera work and the eye candy the cinematography is. It's no masterpiece, but it doesn't wann achieve anything else, as it doesn't take itself seriously. That's what makes the film work out. Enjoyable!",The Final Girls
68,jcbutthead86,An Excellent And Hilarious Horror-Comedy.,10,17 February 2016,"The Final Girls is an excellent and hilarious Horror-Comedy that combines great direction,a fantastic cast,a terrific script and a memorable score. All of those elements make The Final Girls a fun and unforgettable movie that is a Cult Classic in the making.The Final Girls tells the story of Max(Tessa Farmiga),a young girl who along with her friends on the third anniversary of the death of her Mother Amanda Cartwright(Malin Akerman),a 1980s Horror movie scream queen goes to a screening of her film Camp Bloodbath from 1986. After an accident in the movie theater Max and her friends get sucked into the feature film where Max is reunited with her Mother while they are trying to survive and escape a killer at the camp in the movie.The Final Girls is a terrific and hilarious Horror-Comedy that in a fun and imaginative way spoofs the Slasher films from the 1980s in a smart and creative style that when the laughs start they never stop. At first I was a little skeptical about watching The Final Girls because of the PG-13 Rating because I never heard of a Slasher movie being PG-13 but you can't always judge a book by it's cover and you can't always judge a movie by it's rating because The Final Girls is the definition of a Cult Classic. If you're a fan of Slasher films especially ones from the 1980s that were set at a Summer Camp you will have a great time with The Final Girls a movie that mocks the Slasher genre but pays homage to them at the same time. All of the trademarks of the 80s Slasher films are in The Final Girls whether it's references to the Friday The 13ths(there's even the classic ki ki ki ha ha ha)or the camp setting,stereotypical characters(the virginal heroine,the token slut),the back story on why the killer is killing or the silent masked killer which are mocked in a post-modern and ironic style. The laughs and Humor in The Final Girls are funny and smart with the style of Scream(1996)and the underrated Arnold Schwarznegger Action Parody Last Action Hero in 1993(which had a similar story line). There is also plenty moments of surprises and genuine laughs that you won't see coming and will have you in tears laughing. What's also funny about The Final Girls is the way the Camp setting is brightly colorful with a look you never see in 1980s Slasher flicks which I think adds to the weirdness of the film. This movie never takes itself seriously and you won't either while watching it. The screenplay by M.A Fortin and Joshua John Miller is witty and clever with many stand out scenes. While not very bloody or gory as some of the Slasher films it's mocking The Final Girls does have some kills that are true to the Slasher formula with a little bit of blood. The Final Girls gives viewers some real good suspense scenes which is needed and the suspense actually blends well with the laughs. While a very funny film The Final Girls has moments of heart,depth and drama thanks to scenes between the great main characters Max and her Mother Amanda which are amazing and well-done and give the movie a different dimension and power but doesn't come off as being sappy but great. As for the rest of the main characters despite being stereotypes and over the top are actually likable,interesting and grab your attention as the film moves along. The ending of The Final Girls is hilarious,thrilling and surprising and not only brings the movie full circle but also leaves the ending open for a sequel leaving audiences wanting more. A wonderful conclusion.The cast is great. Taissa Farminga is excellent as Max,with Farminga bringing depth and emotion to the role. Malin Akerman is terrific as Nancy/Amanda Cartright,Max's Mother. Alexander Ludwig is great as Chris,Max's boyfriend. Nina Dobrev is amazing and sexy as Vicki,a friend of Max's. Alia Shawkat is delightful and funny as Gertie,Max's best friend. Thomas Middleditch is hilarious and memorable as Duncan,a Horror/Slasher fan. Adam DeVine(Kurt),Angela Timbur(Tina),Chloe Bridges(Paula)and Tory N. Thompson(Blake)are wonderful and fun as the fictional Camp Counselors. Dan B. Norris is menacing as Billy Murphy,the masked killer.The direction by Todd Strauss-Schulson is energetic and stylish,with Strauss-Schulson bringing a visually stunning look to the film and keeps the film moving. Great direction,Strauss-Schulson.The score by Gregory James Jenkins is fantastic,with Jenkins score being very similar to the Horror film scores of the 1980s which adds to the film. Fine score,Jenkins.In final word,if you love Horror Films,Slasher Movies or Horror-Comedies,I highly suggest you see The Final Girls,an excellent and hilarious Horror-Comedy that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",The Final Girls
69,shanayneigh,Surprisingly sweet,6,21 August 2021,"Reading the trivia, it was fortunate that they chose to focus on the mother-daughter relationship and not just make it a generic slasher snooze fest. That way the movie has some heart.Good thing they killed off Devine and Middleditch early, because I can't stand their improvisational style mugging for the camera.The movie was also mercifully short, about 90 minutes, which is perfect for this type of film.",The Final Girls

71,patriciogl10,Great blend of a spoof and a homage.,6,22 October 2020,"When you have such a fascinating premise it is rather hard not to get interested and excited, but often times the execution of said premise proves
to be abysmal and therefore ruin what could have been a fantastic opportunity. While I don't feel that's the case for The Final Girls, the effort is not met without flaws. The mixture of horror and comedy is an extremely difficult blend to successfully pull it off, and to not fall into a place of ""is funny
because of how bad it is"" which tons of films have sadly come down to. The good thing about the Final Girls is how cleverly it tackles that notion by
primarily being a satire, a spoof on 80s horror clichés, most notably those coming from the slasher subgenre.The main characters find themselves in a movie theater where there is a homage to a very popular 80s horror flick, called Camp Bloodbath, which stars Max's (Taissa Farmiga) late mother (Malin Akerman), who was an actress mainly known for her role in that film. Having passed only three years since a car accident that tragically took her mom's life, Max is conflicted about watching her deceased mother in a film where she gets killed by a masked maniac. The emotional element is present to provide a bigger depth to the story, which works quite well in my opinion. After a weird incident in the movie theater, a fire starts spreading and amidst the chaos, she grabs a machete and opens her and her friends' way through the movie screen, and that is how they get sucked into the Camp Bloodbath film. Having in their group a guy who is a huge fan of the movie proves to be really helpful as he knows what needs to be done to get out of the film's universe.The Final Girls manages to poke fun and pay homage at the same time, and does it with an adequate level of silliness, it doesn't feel over-the-top by any means. It's a well-balanced tone that makes this film all-around enjoyable although I believe that the PG-13 rating did hurt it quite a bit, if it had been rated R, it could have been explosive, so that's the only thing that's lacking in my opinion.I highly recommend it, you'll definitely have fun!",The Final Girls
72,TheRedDeath30,"Been There, Done That",6,22 November 2015,"Thee are a lot of words that seem to come up in every review of this movie, ""love letter"", ""loving homage"", ""satirical"", etc etc. Yes, this movie fits into most of those categories quite firmly. This is, for sure, a loving homage to the 80s slasher film and, most particularly, the Friday THE 13th series. However, this is nothing revolutionary and, in fact, seems to be a mini-genre within horror that is spiraling out of control with carbon copies. You could swing this trend back to SCREAM, but I would submit that it started more recently. There was the cult success of BEHIND THE MASK, followed by CABIN IN THE WOODS and TUCKER & DALE VS EVIL and, all of a sudden, we seem to have a glut of movies where the characters are well aware of the conventions of the horror movie and the director gives continual winks and nods to the audience, knowing that we know that they know we're watching a horror movie. At this point, you could almost make a spoof of the spoofs.That makes me look at these movies with a more critical eye. It's not enough, anymore, to satisfy me with the clever nods to horror history. You need to craft something different. I will admit, right out, that this movie does try to do just that. It attempts to create a horror spoof with a lot more ""heart"" than is typical in the genre, but it also may be the one thing that had me losing interest as the plot developed.The premise is that our main heroine is the daughter of an actress who can't seem to escape the type casting from having appeared in ""Camp Bloodbath"", a slasher classic. After an accident, we flash forward a few years to our heroine struggling to deal with loss. She is invited to a screening of her mother's movie, at which events happen that suck our heroine and a few friends into the movie itself. I may be expecting far too much from a horror film, but I was disappointed in the explanation for how they end up in the movie. It makes no logical sense, but again I know I'm expecting too much there.Once in the movie, the next half hour or so of the film is actually really clever. They are, quite literally, in the movie, which causes a few fun gags. The words that appear on screen actually have dimension and the characters have to hop over them. The flashbacks take place with dripping fluid that brings our characters into a black and white world. They can hear the voice-overs and sounds effects. Naturally, the characters from this movie within the movie take on the classic genre clichés. There is the idiot jock, the slut, the outcast guy, etc, who all fill their types to the maximum. For a good chunk of the run time, this movie is actually really clever and I found myself giggling more than once at in jokes and fun moments.The killer himself is very noticeably a nob to Jason and makes little attempt to mask his homage. Even the costume is almost identical, except for the mask itself. I felt, though, that they could have used the killer more in the movie. His screen time is relatively small and the in jokes could have been used more effectively if they integrated the killer a little more, in my opinion.Where the movie starting losing me is about halfway through, as the plot starts meandering farther away from the horror homage and focusing more on the mother/ daughter relationship that develops between our heroine and her mom, who doesn't even realize she is the mother, of course, she's just a character in this movie within the movie. The script starts trying far too much to inject these ""tender moments"" and develop some emotion and drama into the movie. It starts treading dangerously close to ""chick flick"" territory in the final act, which isn't a bad thing in itself, but it starts losing the threads it was trying to develop in the first half of the movie.This is heightened, I think, by the PG-13 rating, which to me makes no sense in this context. To create a true homage to the 80s slasher should definitely have involved a great deal more blood. This is where BEHIND THE MASK gets so many things right because when you go beyond the clever homage to the slasher, that movie is an effective slasher in its' own right, having truly terrifying moments and some good gore. I would submit SHAUN OF THE DEAD, as well. It's a great comedy, but it works so effectively because it has moments of, also, being a gory, chilling zombie movie. This film never quite reaches those moments where we really feel like we're in a classic slasher, other than the fact that they keep telling us we are. What exactly is the point of making a limited release, direct to video movie PG-13? Who were you marketing this to? TIt's really a shame because this movie brushes greatness. It has moments that are really inspired and made me love what they were doing. It's obviously the work of true Friday THE 13th fans. There are online rumors that the studio forced them into developing the emotional strands that bring this movie down in the end, but this movie would have been far better had they developed the homage more and left the tender mother/ daughter moments on the cutting room floor.",The Final Girls
73,mcjensen-05924,Extremely Creative & Fun,9,25 July 2021,"Excellent, original concept executed perfectly. With a very talented, young and attractive cast and a script full of genuinely memorable moments this movie keeps things interesting right from the beginning. All emotions and plot points are conveyed to the viewer without the typical gross out gore, profanity and nudity, which just testifies to the strength of the writing and directing. It has a campy feel to it that's very fitting to the subject matter. It's so easy to get absorbed in this movie and just enjoy the ride. Great backstory, very good acting, and dislodge that's witty and time/setting appropriate. Attention to detail was given here that serious genre aficionados will appreciate. For fans of Tucker & Dale and the first 2 Evil Dead movies. I thought everything was done just right. Nothing too outlandish or beyond the scope of the narrative. Very funny moments scattered throughout, and a few tender ones as well. The young ladies were very easy on the eyes and the males held up their end of the action just fine. 8.5 rounded up to 9.

The comedy plays straight down the middle, rarely achieving an audible laugh, but not deserving of any facepalm groans either. The movie could have risen above with it's homage to the slasher genre, and any details in the filming, dialogue, fashion or effects that truly captured the era would have been greatly appreciated.

""you might be the killer ""did the meta thing"" better even though it has also the problem of we not caring about the characters.don't get me wrong i understand why some people enjoyed a lot of this: it's cool to see the rules subverted, the film is immaginative i liked the cinematography. the concept is the best part: it's awesome, it's a great idea. some of the campy lines in the original movie are fun for being so lame. the problem is that the protagonists should be more aware and critic about what they're seeing. like it is it seems more as a pilot tv show or something.mostly because the idea is good i don't give a lower grade. also because i enjoy alia shawkat and thomas middletich, (and the actors in general are fine, that's not the problem). but to analyse the movie without the geniality of the concept it feels really short. not much scary. not much funny. not much tense. and not much emotional, even though the film tries.",The Final Girls

With an interesting premise, Unique concept for a Slasher and fun characters that make this a fun movie from start to finish.The story in this one is really interesting and is a pretty unique premise for a Slasher movie with Max being trapped in her deceased mother's cult classic Slasher in which she starred Camp Bloodbath. It's an interesting concept that worked really well in this movie.The characters are great especially the main character Max who is a great Final Girl in this movie and Duncan who is the Randy character of the movie and knows all about Slashers and how to survive he is a fun character aswell.The dynamic with the characters is well handled and I really like how the relationship is handled between Max and her Mother Amanda and how it plays out when Max is stuck in her movie with Max getting close to her character and wanting to safe her but can't because her character is supposed to die in the movie which leads to some really well handled emotional moments.There is some amazing moments and brilliant shots the ones that stand out are when they are setting the trap to stop the killer and them going back in time seeing the origin of the killer.They are brilliantly shot moments and use interesting film techniques that make them a blast to watch.The only issues with the movie is there are some annoying characters like Tina who plays the typical dumb girl in a Slasher movie and she gets really annoying sometimes in my opinion and the Comedy element around this character just doesn't work for me.I also wish this movie wasn't rated PG13 this movie could've been a little better if the Kills had more Gore to them it would of made for better Slasher movie in my opinion.Verdict 8.5/10 a fun Slasher movie that as an interesting premise and fun characters with some amazing emotional moments that work for a horror movie.

It also has some highly original ideas and plays with its premise of lambasting 80's slashers with lots of ingenuity and some nostalgic affection. Its also incredibly silly.,The Final Girls
85,lnvicta,A satirical meta-slasher with a surprising amount of heart.,8,30 October 2015,"The Final Girls may appear to be another stupid campy horror spoof a la Scary Movie but rest assured, it's not. It's most comparable to The Cabin in the Woods, but while that movie deconstructed horror as a whole, The Final Girls' focus is specifically on slashers. It's about a slasher movie star and her daughter who get into a fatal car accident. The daughter survives and years later, her and her friends go to see the slasher movie her mother starred in, then something happens in the theater and somehow the group ends up in the film they were watching. It may sound dumb but all disbelief can easily be suspended due to the smooth transitions, clever dialogue, great acting, and characters you actually care about.Once they enter the ""movie"" world, it's simply a blast to watch. Slasher tropes are pointed out, made fun of, and even implemented well when necessary. The virgin girl is the only one who can kill the killer and it must be with his own machete. Sound familiar? Also, anyone who has sex ends up getting killed. Yeah, it's Friday the 13th all over again, except with a new cast. Every character has a personality and has their place in the movie. There's the jock douche, the slutty space cadet, the innocent shy girl, the hipster, you name it. They all work perfectly together, and it's hard to single out one actor as a highlight because the acting throughout is highly impressive for a horror movie. Mainly the two female leads (Max and her mom) have tangible chemistry and some truly heartfelt moments.So is The Final Girls scary? Not exactly, but does have some badass shots like the killer jumping out of a window in slo-mo while he and his machete are on fire, and someone actually dies by falling face first into a bear trap. Ouch. More importantly though, The Final Girls is funny without being dumb. It's clever humor, and it works around the plot so you have fun while being totally invested in the story. The most surprising thing about this movie is the amount of heart it has. Rarely do tearful personal conversations work in slashers, but here they make up some of the most powerful scenes. Simply put, The Final Girls is an adventure, and for any meta-horror comedy fans, it's one you should not miss.",The Final Girls

88,80sHorror,A little gem of a movie,10,25 October 2015,"If your an 80's Horror/Slasher FanBoy like myself then this film is for you. Clever nods to the audience, tongue n cheek, self aware/meta humour is in full force. Think the wit and humour of Scream blended together with Friday the 13th, plus some surprisingly emotional depth. Loved it! I cannot fathom why this did not get a cinema release, it is absolutely brilliant. A clever, knowing, (though never self mocking) homage to 80s slasher flicks. The cast are uniformly brilliant and great to see Nina Dobrev in something other than the Vampire Diaries. If you love Scream and the self referential horror you are sure to enjoy this. Give it a try, this will go down as another of those hidden gems that COME ALIVE on DVD, rather like 'Trick R Treat.' Neglected and ignored when in fact it is sheer brilliance and really quite moving. Lovely commentary too!",The Final Girls
89,wycherleyp-960-470658,never judge a film by its title,9,11 October 2015,"I love the horror genre and over the years there have been some real treats from first scream movie to insidious, we have had our fair share of greats. When people decide to do a comedy/horror i always dread it as its a tough mixture to pull of......the final girls is BRILLIANT!!! Think last action hero mixed in with Friday 13th. Max (taissa farmiga) is a grieving girl after the loss of her mother who is a film star that dies in a car crash, her mothers biggest film was a 80s horror called ""camp bloodbath"" after some convincing max's friends persuade her to join them in going to watch the film in a cinema where certain events happen and as they try find a escape out of the cinema and end up getting transported into the 80s film on screen facing the masked killer.The plot sounds silly but it truly works like i said last action hero mixed in with Friday 13th, the camera angles are genius the acting is spot on with comedy at correct times and i have to say the dream sequence is cinematic brilliance.One of the most surprising enjoyable films for quite a while, i would advise you watch this film as from start to finish its pure homage to a horror genre that time forgot.Ps the end fight scene........well done",The Final Girls
90,chrismackey1972,Surprisingly Fun!,7,9 October 2015,"Trash. That's what I thought it would be. However, I watched it because I was suffering Nina Dobrev withdrawal since she left The Vampire Diaries. This movie proved me wrong on so many levels. It was fun, clever, and something that seems largely absent in Hollywood nowadays -- ORIGINAL! The cast was good in their roles. The lead did a great job on the touching scenes with her mother, who didn't know she was her mother until the end of the film.I gave this movie a 7-star rating. I would give it higher, but I do reserve 8, 9, and 10-star ratings for films that are really superb. Though, I really did like this movie. I recommend it to anyone who likes 80s horror films as well as horror spoofs. I will say that this is probably the best horror spoof I've ever seen. Most of them have lame writing, acting, and production value. This was really fun.",The Final Girls
91,MattBirk,A Brilliant Idea!,7,10 October 2015,"The Final Girls is a very unique take on the ever growing meta horror sub-genre. It takes a group of characters and inserts them into a fictional 80s horror movie slasher, Camp Bloodbath. Once there they must try to not only return to the real world, but also survive the movie before being hacked to pieces by little Billy Murphy. And once in the movie we meet those lovable, clichéd characters that most of us are familiar with, the virgin (aka the final girl), the quiet shy girl (aka the cute girl who sadly doesn't survive), the sexy party girl (aka you have zero chance of surviving), the jock (aka the sexual deviant), the wannabe hero (aka you aren't the real hero so you're gonna die), and a few more body count extras.The movie for the most part is very funny, especially early on in the movie when we first meet the original characters in the movie. Everyone is so over the top when we first meet them that it's hard not to have a smile on your face at anytime they are speaking. Every conversation leads back to some sort of sexual innuendo and it's great. But then there are other times when we get some one on one time between a mother and her daughter and the movie is surprisingly touching and emotional during those moments. It's this aspect of the movie that gives the movie a pulse, you care about these characters (even if the movie isn't as dark and daunting as it seems to be).But that's not to say the movie is perfect, there are times when I found myself disappointed with the script and the direction the movie was taking. It's not that it was terrible, but there was so much room for a movie like this that I wish it had thrown in a few more ideas. After all the movie is barely 90 minutes long and I feel the majority of people wouldn't mind sticking around a bit longer to see some other ideas flourish. The Final Girls is one of the better movies to fly under the radar and if you count this as a horror movie (which it's very light on horror) it would certainly quality as one of the best of the year. Like I said, the movie packs a surprisingly emotional punch but also doles out plenty of zany mayhem to keep you interested. Hopefully this this movie is a big enough hit on VOD that it somehow gets a sequel because we all know sequels are bigger, badder, and crazier than the original, especially those wacky 80s slashers!",The Final Girls
92,HorrorOverEverything,Such A Great Surprise,8,9 October 2015,"I am fresh off of watching this and wow, this was a lot of fun. I was afraid that this was going to turn out like every other recent film with a young cast and be riddled with MTV type clichés but it wasn't at all. The cast was great and film as a whole was pretty funny and brutal (for a PG-13 Film).The premise was great and original, they really came up with a clever way to spoof the 80's slasher genre. The sub plot was even well done and made for some fairly emotional scenes. The film worked on all levels and was blast to watch. I really enjoyed itIt's weird but when I really like a film I find it hard to say a whole lot about it. When I hate a film I can shoot out four or five paragraphs no problem, but I enjoyed this film so much that I am finding it hard to come up with much to say. Just watch it.8/10",The Final Girls
93,pal05052003,More comedy-drama horror than horror comedy but is an extremely rare movie that I enjoy the supporting characters as much as the main characters.,8,31 August 2021,"I thought I was tired of slasher films, so when I saw the title, I did not care too much. But having seen Taissa Farmiga in American Horror movie, I thought to give it a try. Not that I am a fan of her, but I loved AHS, so I figured this movie should be good, and I was pleasantly surprised. I actually like Farmiga in this movie and even felt for her character. Everyone else was great too. The movie balances well between horror, comedy, and drama. Though it is more comedy drama, than horror. The idea of real people being trapped in a movie is great, here they play it very well. They even have a great set up for the ending. My favorite supporting character was Angela Trimbur's Tina, who is very funny, and Angela manages to play the role with conviction. Nina Dobrev manages to shine in every scene, though she does not get much. In fact, everyone manages to do great in whatever bit parts they have, and that is one of the major strengths of the movie.",The Final Girls

It's just lame.Found myself hating and becoming disinterested 40% of the way through.",The Final Girls
95,ryanpersaud-59415,There Have Been Better Movies Like This,5,15 September 2021,"The Good: For such an (obviously) low budget movie, this cast is STACKED. I think Middleditch, Shawkat, and Dobrev in particular are fantastic in this movie and I loved the chemistry of the main cast. Farmiga and Akerman have a strong relationship and I think it's a nice through line throughout the film to anchor it emotionally.I also think this movie's set design is awesome and very creative. It's a generally good looking movie with a wild camera and fantastic editing. The technical side of this movie is where it really shines.The Bad: There have been better movies in this vein since and even before. Cabin In the Woods, Tucker and Dale, hell, even Fear Street. My biggest issues with this movie are presentation, pacing and consistency. If you're going to homage 80s era Friday the 13th, why...have the movie look like a slasher from 2015? Why is the presentation so incongruent? You can do this well (see Fear Street II) and it just felt like a missed opportunity.I also felt that this movie - again, meant to evoke 1980s slashers - was just paced really poorly. We get a huge chunk of the movie where almost nothing horror related happens. It's fine...but inconsistent with the internal logic of the movie. In an 80s slasher, there is no way the gap between kills would be this long.Finally, the movie just doesn't know its own rules. Characters are meant to be tied to the plot of the film, but then they don't. The characters are supposed to be stuck in a time loop dictated by the film. But then they aren't. They can somehow change the rules of the movie and it's never explained.The Ugly: The movie that this movie takes place in...sounds like a really bad movie. I think that's where Final Girls sort of falls flat on its face. It's a pastiche of 1980s horror, but not really. It loves the genre, but doesn't really get the tropes right. It looks good, but feels like a student film at times. It's just a mixed bag.",The Final Girls

I will admit that it gives off serious vibes as ""chick flick"" at moments, but if you love movies like Friday the 13th and The Burning then you'll really enjoy this. It has a fantastic cast, really clever effects and an awesome ""flashback"" scene that is brilliantly done. Highly recommendable!",The Final Girls
97,pawanpunjabithewriter,"Quite Interesting Plot, but next time try to find out a better movie to get into",4,2 July 2021,"My review could be half spoiler. No issues if you have watched the trailer, that reveals the most of it and spoils the few surprises it rarely offers. See, the idea is good, but where you are taking this idea to should have pondered a little more. What meaningless dim-wit story you're bringing the characters into. Is that even a story? It should have been the foremost job to find a good story which we are getting into. The simple basic isn't ticked. Also, the characters aren't crafted. They are nonsensical. Cast is something to have looked after too. Not impressed with the after-climax part either. Fantasy is acceptable, however, it's noticeable when it turns into supernaturally magic. Not recommended to anyone unless you're into your early teens. Quite a lot of early teens have a dark desire of watching slasher movies accompanying friends. Even if, I'd be surprised to know all enjoyed.Highly Overrated movie.PS: The title should have been The Last Slasher Hero. If you know you know, Legend Schwarzenegger.",The Final Girls
98,spmact,I was hoping for so much more,7,17 October 2015,"From the trailer this looked like it was going to be so good. It was great to see a film that knew about horror rules like the Scream series, but was going to do it in a funny way. They could have done so much more with the characters being in the 80s and knowing that they're in a movie, but they ultimately failed to take advantage of those facts in a way that turned out to be entertaining (they tried in a few ways but ultimately fell flat). The relationship between the main character and her mom turned out to be nice, but it got too much attention in my opinion (thought it was acted well by both parts). They also pulled a Transformers 4/Godzilla by having a very disappointing early death of a character, but I won't say any more about that and will let you decide if you agree. Ultimately I thought the film was decent, and it had some nice moments, but I walked away thinking that they could have done much more with the concept.",The Final Girls
99,NileFortnerBoogieBuddha954,Modern teens find themselves trapped in a 1980s slasher movie,7,24 July 2016,"For those who may or may not know,The Final Girls is a 2015 American slasher comedy film, directed by Todd Strauss-Schulson and written by M.A. Fortin and Joshua John Miller. The film stars Taissa Farmiga (American Horror Story, The Bling Ring) and Malin Åkerman (Watchmen, 27 Dresses)The supporting performances include Adam DeVine (Workaholics, Pitch Perfect), Thomas Middleditch (The Other Guys, Fun Size), Alia Shawkat (Whip It, Green Room), Alexander Ludwig (The Hunger Games, Grown Ups 2), Nina Dobrev (Let's Be Cops, upcoming XXX:Return of Xander Cage), Chloe Bridges (The Longshots, Legally Blondes), and Angela Trimbur (Halloween 2). The plot follows a group of college students who are transported into a 1986 slasher film called Camp Bloodbath.Anyone, who is a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger in the film The Last Action Hero, The Cabin in the Woods, Cooties, Tucker & Dale v.s. Evil, the first two Scream films, and fans of 1980s horror Grindhouse/B-movies will hopefully enjoy this as much as I did.To be honest, I thought the acting was just okay. I believe it shows the actors were having fun in there roles. But the supporting cast could have had more backstory, depth, and personality to there characters. The supporting cast really felt like a supporting cast, and I personally like to see supporting characters come off as just as important as the main ones. Adam Devine was Adam Devine, and he didn't over do the comedy. Meaning, he knows his limits.Malin Akerman does a good job of being the final girl in the movie within a movie. She came off a little like Jennifer love-Hewitt in the film I Know What you Did Last Summer. Taissa Farmiga's character really brought a serious emotion to the film. In a world where our characters come off a little cartoonish, she was the one who seemed real, and really connected to the viewer. It was cool to see how her character developed and changed from the start of the movie to the end.Do I feel like this movie is meant for everyone? No. I believe if you are someone who is a fan of horror, comedy spoofs, and can appreciate and understand the horror films of the 1980s, I think you'll dig this one.So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on The Final Girls. it's not a perfect film, but still enjoyable. I personally still think the best horror spoofs are the firs.t two Scream films, Tucker & Dale v.s. Evil, and The Cabin in the Woods. The movie does feel a little cartoonish, weak, and silly at times. But, I appreciate the direction this movie has, the respect for old school horror flicks, and the cast come off like they really had some fun. The Final Girls is a good film to give a chance. i believe The Final girls earns a...7/10!This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie.

Kind of Back to the future-ish in a way. But alas, it quickly went off the rails. Even if you suspend disbelief, nothing makes sense. The acting is so-so. Set design is ok, nothing special. CGI was decent. It was supposed to be set in a 1986 slasher film but characters from that time period made 21st century references and jokes. Costumes didn't reflect 86 or hair styles for that matter. I also pegged the ""twist"" ending which I hate doing. On a positive note it's worth a shot if nothing else is on.

Stuck inside the movie, Max befriends the character played by her lost mother, fighting off the evil Billy to find the loop out of this slasher flick.This is a charming homage to 80's camp horror in gleaming colors. It features stylish music, lots of one-liners, and characters that are just clichéd enough to be both funny and believable. Despite not taking itself too seriously, THE FINAL GIRLS also manages to convey some genuine emotions and a heartfelt story about the loss of a mother. The movie has general appeal to a wide audience but you're more likely going to enjoy this one having seen a few slasher flicks before. In particular, there's numerous references to the original Friday THE 13TH. In being so meta about horror, THE FINAL GIRLS is quite comparable to CABIN IN THE WOODS—but it isn't nearly as gory.All in all, I can highly recommend this one.",The Final Girls

Right when I was thinking to myself that the cinematography in this movie was so good they start flashing those ""lightnings"" in your face for like 10 mins and you go blind.

There's a good blend of comedy, drama and it's full of surprises. It's a horror movie at heart, but not in a serious way. I love the concept and execution behind it. The acting is great. The actors pull out the right emotions and are very believable in their portrayals of their characters. Taissa Farmiga is especially good as Max and nails the emotional turmoil and struggle she's going through with her performance. The film looks great, the FXs are excellent and it flows at a nice even pace. The song choices they chose are perfect. There isn't much I don't like about the film. The only area it might have felt a bit more genuine in the time period of film it was the lack of Nudity or Gore. Those were staples of that time period. I get it, they were trying to appeal to a larger audience, but it just seems a bit suspect those were two things that were absent. No, it doesn't have to be there to make the film work, but it's also a huge part of that era. Other than that, this film pushes all the right buttons.This currently sits at number 18 on my all-time favorite horror movies list. While it's not a true horror film, it has enough elements that I qualify it as such. A pseudo-horror if you will. If you love 80's slasher fare or horror in general from that decade this one's worth checking out. My Rating: 8.5/10",The Final Girls
105,BobbyT24,THIS is what a horror satire is supposed to look like!!,9,5 November 2015,"I miss the classic horror movies of the late-'70s and early-'80s. Going to the movies with a group of friends to be scared was fun back then.Today, the ""Horror"" genre means ""gross out the audience through any extreme means and depravity possible"". The ""SAW"" franchise and garbage like it is lost on me. I won't watch ""snuff"" films for the sake of ""art"" - similar to the old ""Faces of Death"" which was banned internationally. No wonder Columbine and so many scary real life events are happening. People are force-fed vile, classless, merciless carnage in theaters dressed as a ""movie"" when it is nothing close to art. If it's got a ""script"", it's acceptable because it's Unrated. What happened to our movie standards? Whatever happened to fairly tongue-in-cheek villains like Freddy, Jason and Michael Moore-type slashers of the not-so-long-ago?Back in the early-1980s, we used to have teen movie nights with slasher films like ""Carrie"", ""Friday the 13th"", ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", etc. Old, scratchy VHS tapes on a boob tube with popcorn and soda with a mixed group of teenagers who laughed and jumped at ""the killer who couldn't die"" and the stories that were told - not just to slaughter but to entertain and scare the audience. It was nearly a religious right of passage to watch those movies en-masse. Those days are long gone I am afraid... Or are they?""The Final Girls"" is everything a horror film from the '80s was supposed to be - gory, funny, sexy, campy, killer who can't die... with some very modern twists. Imagine my surprise when this FABULOUS throwback movie appeared and almost made my stand up and cheer!! The casting was spot-on with newcomers who simply stole scene after scene from one another in the best way possible. You fall in love with the cast and actually care whether they meet their untimely demise or not as the movie progresses.Synopsis: Max is a 15yo girl who lost her actress mother (Malin Ackerman) in a freak car accident three years ago. Flash-forward to today and Max still hasn't gotten over the tragic loss. On the anniversary of mom's death, there is a movie marathon showing her mom's most famous role - the iconic 1980s slasher flick, ""Camp Bloodbath"". So Max and several friends go to the movie with some reluctance but to honor her mom's memory. During the festival, a fire starts and instead of fleeing into the stampede, Max and her friends are somehow transported INTO THE MOVIE! Once they realize what's going on, they must figure out how to save the fictional characters (including Max's mother!) AND THEMSELVES and survive the bloody rampage of Billy the crazed killer! This is the movie ""The Last Action Hero"" wanted to be but wasn't with the protagonist being sucked into the movie and helping the characters along in the story. The best part of this movie - and there are many GREAT parts to this movie!!!! - is the writing. The writer and director truly cared about putting a quality movie together. This isn't a movie done for the dollar. It is a genuine ode to '80s slasher flicks. The humor, twists, and modern language blended so well into an entire story where real and fictional people work together to save one another in funny, tragic, heartbreaking fashion. It's magical. But my favorite part of the film is the dynamic between Max and her fictional yet oh-so-real mother. It isn't just a ""save her at all costs""-type thing. The delicate balance of future Max and fictional ""Nancy"" is extremely well written. You feel the chemistry of both actresses. Plus add in all the comedy and scary moments... This movie was just plain F-U-N!!!! To quote an '80s term - it was ""most excellent"".The entire cast is a joy to watch. My 17yo son and I laughed at joke after joke - both 80s and current day. You could tell the actors had a blast on the set and their chemistry was evident on-screen in every single frame. The deaths were graphic enough, funny and surprising. It fit so perfectly together. Even the end is self-aware and hilarious. And please stay for the closing credits. You will be rewarded with even more laughs! :-) This past weekend, my son invited thirteen high school buddies of both sexes over for just such a movie fest - a good test group with different backgrounds. Nobody had heard of ""The Final Girls"" and most wanted different scary movies. My son held firm - and after the movie ended - every kid who was complaining at the beginning told him he was right. They LOVED it!!!I give this my highest recommendation for any late-high school movie night for older teenagers who will appreciate the humor and is the targeted age group (re: age 17+). A perfect mix would be the original ""Friday the 13th"" (R-rated) and maybe throw in the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" with a teenage Johnny Depp (talk about ""camp""!!) and ""The Final Girls"" (PG-13-rated) in that order. They would get the gist and gore of the original 80s feel of movies. Then the funnier, more updated ""Final"" movie. It would be a perfect evening to cleanse the horror pallet.On a standard movie rating against all movies of any genre, I give it an 8 of 10. It is well worth watching. From a pure camp and comedy satire of old horror movies they don't make anymore, I give it a 10 out of 10. This is a MUST WATCH for anyone who loved Jason/Freddy/Michael movies from years gone by. Grab some popcorn, invite some friends over and enjoy the show!!!!! :-)",The Final Girls

107,BrentHankins,"A spoof of the slasher genre, and a love letter to its absurdity.",8,16 March 2015,"The combination of horror and comedy is always a volatile recipe, and the failure to mix those ingredients just right can often result in disaster. But every once in awhile, a film comes along that manages to stumble upon the secret formula for success, with Cabin in the Woods being the most recent example. Now, three years after that film blew the roof off the Paramount Theater at the SXSW Film Festival, we have another SXSW debut that premiered to a cacophonous ovation: director Todd Strauss-Schulson's The Final Girls.Max Cartwright (Taissa Farmiga) is struggling with loss after the tragic death of her mother, 80s slasher flick icon Amanda Cartwright (Malin Akerman). When she attends an anniversary screening of her mom's landmark film, Camp Bloodbath, a freak accident transports Max and her friends (Alia Shawkat, Alexander Ludwig, Thomas Middleditch and Nina Dobrev) into the film itself, where they're forced to abide by the rules of the movie's narrative in an attempt to survive. Of course, everyone knows that anyone who has sex in an 80s horror film is bound to be butchered shortly after, so Max finds herself in the awkward position of trying to convince her mother's character not to sleep with the cocky, swaggering Kurt (Adam Devine), whose dialogue is almost entirely made up of sexual innuendo. Meanwhile, the attractive but vapid Tina (Angela Trimbur) is constantly trying to disrobe, which is a big no-no in this film, since a pair of bare breasts will bring the masked killer and his machete running.Fans of the Friday the 13th or Sleepaway Camp series will find plenty to love here as the film gleefully pokes fun at genre tropes, and much of the fun comes from the fact that Max and her friends aren't just living in the world of the film - they're living in the actual film, complete with voiceovers, on screen credits, and flashbacks. There are so many hilarious moments that the film practically begs for repeated viewings, as audiences are bound to be laughing so hard that they'll miss some of the rapid-fire humor.There are a few times when The Final Girls gets a little too stylish, such as poorly rendered early scene that involves a bottle of vodka rolling across the floor of a crowded theater, and there are a few moments where the film seems to forsake its own rules in favor of an extra laugh. But these are minor complaints, and the audience at the Paramount Theater certainly didn't allow these nitpicks to detract from the overall experience. The Final Girls is an immensely fun experience that finds a great balance between being a spoof of the genre, and a love letter to its absurdity.",The Final Girls

Honestly one of the worst actresses I've ever witnessed, I'm not exaggerating, watch her and pay attn and it'll blow ur mind how consistently bad she is. Adam whatever his name is didn't seem to fit as the lead. Has some creative stuff in it which is more than I cAn say for 93.72% of movies these days. I would bump this up to a 6.5 if I could bear Angela Trimbur but she seriously ruins whatever I watch when she's in it. I hope they make a movie abdout someone shaving her ridicosuloy overdone eyebrows that she stands behind like having thick eyebrows is some beacon of feminism that actively helps take down the patriarchy.",The Final Girls
109,the_bluesman,A fantastic slasher homage,9,25 December 2015,"I didn't expect all too much from this movie but I really wanted to see it because I love Taissa Farmiga and Malin Akerman. I have to say that THE FINAL GIRLS was a great surprise. It is a superb horror parody but also a really ambitious homage to the great slasher movies of the 1980s. Nothing in this movie is too over the top. It is not really a straight-out comedy although it has many funny moments. The movie also gets pretty deep at times with some unexpectedly dramatic scenes with Taissa's and Malin's characters. I liked that. THE FINAL GIRLS is a respectful tribute to everything we love about '80s slashers. I especially liked the final minutes with the fantastic, visually striking showdown and the obligatory open ending (which was very well staged). Kudos to director Todd Strauss-Schulson for creating a movie like this. By the way, Gregory James Jenkins' score is amazing and makes the movie even better for me!",The Final Girls

115,cbak223,Not so Final Girls,6,19 November 2015,"The Final Girls directed by Todd Strauss Schulson, absolutely couldn't wait to see this film I was expecting a great new Horror/Comedy, instead I saw a film with a lot of holes and flaws. Let me explain, I'm sure in pre-production this looked great on paper, you have a fantastic story of a young girl and her mother struggling to make ends meet as a actress, abruptly are involved in a car crash and the young girl survives, but mama does not. The young lady in this case is played by Taissa Farmiga(Max) and her mother(Nancy/Amanda Cartwright) played by the beautiful, talented Malin Akerman. Now Malin needs no introduction, but I did think that Taissa gave a good performance throughout. The story unfolds by Max attending a local theater, showing a horror film her mother was known for. It's filled with horror loving teens, college kids and one is drinking and one is smoking, we'll all though we know that wouldn't happen(yeah right) they proceed to set the theater a blaze and upon trying to escape Max and her friends Played by Nina Dobrev(Nikki Summers), Thomas Middleditch(Duncan),& Alexander Ludwig(Chris Briggs. They are Magically transported to, you guessed it The film her mother stars in the 80's Horror hit, ""Camp Bloodbath"". Taken straight off to look and feel exactly like a Friday the 13th, director Todd Schulson did do a good job production wise to give it that feel. The cast of characters are soon met with you guessed it, the stars of the movie. The emotional attachment you feel when Max sees her mother again in real life, but in ""movie real life"". They now are part of the film, ""Camp Bloodbath"" and apparently the only way to escape is to kill the crazed killer, but only The Final Girl can do so. Now this is the point in the film that should have been better. You had a fantastic story that all horror genre loving people will cling too, you have a fantastic cast of young, up and comers, and more established actors. And a brilliant set. I personally thought there were way more things to do with this script and make the cast have more fun, more drugs,more sex,more comedy. It just didn't land. Little quick looks at the actors on they're own we're there, but they just weren't good. This a horror/comedy just not with too much of both. Screenplay written by M.A. Fortin, I'm sorry my man on paper it was gold, on screen it just needed more. But the best damn part of the whole movie was yes, Angela Trimbur playing Tina, this character was great, funny,sexy,over the top. Can't get enough of that dance scene it was probably the highlight of many from this film, how fun to have been there on set watching that. Too good, overall maybe I just expected too much for such a great script,story, actors, but all in all it is worth the watch. Especially for Tina!",The Final Girls

Reunited, the women must fight off the film's maniac killer.We have seen movies like this before but The Final Girls feels fresh and blows other films away. The story sounds ridiculous on paper but it's not. This film is fun and pays homage to classic 80's slasher movies. It takes the thought of ""If I was in this movie I'd....."" and runs with it and comes out with independent gold.The cast is awesome and they worked well together, unfortunately Thomas Middleditch (Silicon Valley) and Adam DeVine (Workaholics) steal the show because they have some of the best lines and they are in highly popular TV shows. Taissa Farmiga is the main star and her shy quiet girl turned bad ass screem queen could make her a classic slasher film star. This cast is strong, talented and can bring the laughs.The cinematography resembles a classic 80's slasher film look, mostly based on Friday the 13th. Yes, the C.G. is cheesy but it gives the film cham. The Final Girls has laughs, a cheesy plot and it stuck with me for days after. This movie shouldn't be taken serious, it's light and moves at a nice quick pace. So if you have nothing to do late on a Friday night, pop it in and enjoy.

Former scream queen Amanda from the Camp Bloodbath series has just had another failed audition and moans to her daughter max in the car about never do horrors... In a sweet scene the pair are happily singing along to Bettie Davis Eyes when the have a crash leaving Max the only survivor...Years on the local cinema are having a double feature of the Camp Bloodbath movies Max agrees to go with her best friend Gertie, Horror fanatic ad Gerties brother Duncan, Max's crush Chris and stuck up Vicki. As the cinema starts to get excited a fire starts and seeing the only way to escape Max cuts through the screen, only to find them selves in the 1986 horror trying to survive. Especially when they realise the Final Girl is always a virgin.The movie contains some humour as 80s characters try to blend in with the modern day many factors including clothes and technology.Its comical, yet horror based and watchable by non horror fans as well, It has all the aspects to be a cult classic",The Final Girls

Albeit the special effects are a bit underwhelming, but what are you expecting for a movie that didn't even pass a $5mil budget. This is an excellent script, and cast with perfect organic chemistry on screen. There's a couple hilarious segments between characters during the whole escapade that had me laughing, and a couple moments where even me, a grown man, welled up. It'll hit a few different emotions on its path to satisfy that 80's teen camp horror niche'. It's not meant to be a serious horror, so please don't expect to be startled, scared or even remotely made uneasy by the main antagonist. This isn't that kind of movie.

124,ardentayu,Fun homage to old slasher films,8,25 April 2018,"This retro throwback horror film is a nod to horror films past, much in the way Scream was in the 90s. This one takes it even farther in that the characters are transported to the set of a 1980s horror movie and they are stuck there.... This of course relates to a dramatic character arc for the main character who's movie played a part in this very film. So there's a pretty well-done mother/daughter element to the story. This movie has humor, including parody-type humor, and it has scares but not excessive gore. It really is an homage to the slasher genre. It feels like Friday the 13th meets Ernest Goes to Camp.

I've seen more violence and gore in scooby doo, I'm not saying every film has to be a gore fest but if you are making a tribute to the 80's slasher audience how old do you think they are, they are at least in their 40's not teens. If you're gunna do a film go all in not half hearted hoping teenagers will turn up to the cinema, trust me, my cinema is full of adults and I think everyone is getting sick of movies being targeted towards kids.Disappointed",The Final Girls

I did chuckle now and again but i expected so much more. I felt for Max and i could sympathise with her as I've also felt that same loss but i still didn't find myself rooting for her, Taissa Farmiga acts the exact same in everything i have ever seen her in and it is starting to bug me, she just pulls the same expressions constantly and it would be nice to see her in a different role to see if i'm wrong. I didn't really warm to very many of the characters but out of the bunch Malin Akerman's Amanda was definitely the best and most of the laughs were caused by the character Tina (slutty girl). The two scenes i enjoyed the most were both of those characters dancing to their individual songs. I won't say anymore than that though as i don't want to spoil anything for anyone. I also found the flashback scenes and the slow motion scenes to be very entertaining and i loved the films overall look but unfortunately that was all. It mostly fell flat for me, mostly because they were trying too hard to be funny and most of the jokes just aren't. During the end credits there was a blooper reel and they are some of the un-funniest bloopers i have ever seen. I cringed. This film really had the potential to be something great so i am definitely disappointed.",The Final Girls

It was a really fun concept and it was even okay with how they ended up in the movie but once there it started to go to crap. People compared it to Cabin in the Woods but what I think it was going for was more along the lines of Tucker & Dale vs Evil. The film was focused on satiring slasher flicks but in particular obviously Friday the 13th. Taissa Farmiga desperately needed to be recast. She clearly is an actress better suited for drama. She just looked sad the whole movie. It's like trying to cast Rooney Mara in a comedy. Not gonna work. All and all it just did not touch on nearly enough Friday the 13th type cliches such as over the top kills and it mixed in too much drama to be an effective satire. To eliminate some of the drama I think her mom should have died when she was younger so that she wasn't so attached. A for effort though.,The Final Girls

The plot of this movie if you haven't seen the trailer or heard much buzz about the film is simple... A group of kids are accidentally pulled into a horror/teen slasher comedy.

134,HungryCreatureProductions,Restrained yet effective takedown of the slasher genre,8,25 June 2020,"Important side note: This is NOT to be confused with the movie Final Girl which came out the same year as The Final Girls and shares a male lead actor. Very weird.The fabric of reality itself is toyed with when a group of movie nerds are sucked into a famous slasher movie. Their struggle to both escape the film in which they are trapped and to understand the rules by which they must follow to progress is actually a secondary plot-line to a surprisingly emotional core. Our lead character, Max, is in a personal hell as her late mother was the lead actress in the movie in which she and her friends are trapped. Not only must she escape, but she has to watch a younger version of her mother playing a different character attempt to escape the psycho-camp-killer as well.This all sounds kind of traumatic, but in practice it walks a fine line between hilarious and touching. As it is a send-up of the slasher genre, expect a lot of humor specifically tailored to those who've seen a good many slasher movies. Our hero and her mother are the most fleshed out of the characters and, while their bond is very skillfully handled, we never learn much about them or the rest of the characters to be honest. The acting is generally pretty good, the actors gamely embracing stereotypes of stereotypes for comedic value. Some of the actors embrace the silliness a bit too hard, pushing their performances from hilarity to unintentionally cringeworthy-levels, but these instances are few and far between.While the characters may be a bit stale, the story is anything but. While a similar movie, Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon, opted to make light of the genre by inserting slasher tropes into the real world, Final Girls sidesteps reality entirely. Pulling the real world characters into a movie world allows the story to explore the comedic side of slashers in a whole new way entirely. What might be stale and frustrating in non-comedies, flashbacks, voice-overs, characters with no depth, etc, becomes a playground for inventive new ideas in The Final Girls. It establishes firm rules in which its world operates, then plays by those rules to great effect. It manages to both effectively mock slashers while creating something completely distinct for itself!This imaginative elbow-to-the-ribs-satire vibe is only dampened by the films refusal to go for the throat. Slashers are known for their excesses, a balance between stupid raunch and blunt morality tale. The Final Girls wants to have it both ways, it tries to pay homage to the slasher as a concept, yet stays safely within the confines of a very conservative PG-13. As I personally am not a fan of the slasher genre in general due to its excesses, I found the restraint in The Final Girls to be right up my alley; however there are moments where the film feels chained up. The choice to hold back in key areas feels made in a boardroom. Some of the restraint doesn't feel natural, despite my personal appreciation of that choice.Overall, if a horror-comedy send up of the slasher genre with a faint Back to the Future vibe mixed with original and unexpected ideas in a PG13 package sounds fun, you're in for a treat with The Final Girls! Honestly, this movie has something that'll appeal to most viewers. The only people I can think of who might not like this one are people who've never liked fright films in any capacity.-Josh Evans",The Final Girls

As a horror movie lover I'm familiar with the tropes, all of which this plays on brilliantly. The plot, characters, acting, direction - all the elements are perfect for a knowing homage to the slasher genre. If you watch it expecting a typical slasher flick, you'll be disappointed.

I don't think you will regret spending the money on it particularly if you're a fan of the genre. Despite its obvious flaws, all of which have been outlined here in great detail, this film is entirely watchable and definitely entertaining. Taissa ain't no Vera, but she definitely holds her own and she is turning out to be a fine little actress herself. Definitely someone to watch.Some reviewers have criticized the film for being PG-13 and I definitely understand their point. Personally, I like boobs with my gore so I tend to agree, but I have to say that it was rather nice to come away from a horror film feeling sort of uplifted rather than grossed out or slightly depressed albeit thoroughly entertained.

Now you may be saying to yourself I have heard the premise of this movie before but differently and yes there was a movie, Last Action Hero with Arnold Schwarzenegger. However this film does play the story differently. It has some unique touches that make it stand out. Some of this film was a little too melodramatic but from certain things that happen I could understand what they were going for. They may have just overdone it in some scenes.

147,dtcwee,Unleash the beast,9,19 February 2020,"The Final Girls takes slasher movie cliches and weaves them into a heartfelt tale of closure, with generous amounts of humor thrown in.Adam Devine delivers the most intentionally cringe-inducing lines, but every character - even those from outside the movie within a movie - gets to spout well-worn staples like 'how are you holding up' whether they realize it or not. The bloopers over the credits shows how much quality material was dropped, which makes the final cut great. It is testament to all involved that they could take such shallow tropes and through timing and delivery turn it into something so meaningful. The makers could fashion a PG-13 movie out of a typically R-rated genre. Even the film's run-time is significant.This movie will draw comparisons with The Cabin in the Woods, particular for its stereotypical main characters. But where Cabin in the Woods is deliberately cruel, The Final Girls delivers finality with kindness.",The Final Girls

What a nonsense. How can they even a) come up with such a crappy story, and b) decide that ""this is great; let's make this movie!""? It is really not possible to understand. The story is so bad and so not interesting. Most horror (horror/comedy) movies are bad, unfortunately, but this is really one of the worst I have ever seen.

The mother-daughter side story was unnecessary and really detracted from the main plot.T2. He boyfriend was horrible? I genuinely thought his character was a joke, but then he ended up kissing our final girl? I get that the pandering was exaggerated, but what about the misogyny and the blatant rudeness to his ex gf?

To tell you the truth, it looked incredibly silly and not like my cup of tea at all, but after a few friends persuaded me to check it out, I found myself pleasantly surprised by how great it was.A young woman is haunted by the sudden death of her scream queen mother and, to make peace with it, she goes to see one of her mother's most famous slasher flicks with her buddies. While in the theater, there's a weird time loop and she and her friends end up inside of the film on the screen.After they've entered the film, they have to fight off a Jason Voorhees-esque hulking killer with the cast of the film itself and the heroine and her mother get to come to terms with each other.A lot of genre bending movies don't work, but this one is so charming and heartfelt that it's hard to not be moved during a few scenes (I'll never listen to Bette Davis Eyes without sobbing after seeing this movie). I think an R rating might have helped the film feel more like a true slasher film, but it's a minor quibble when the writing and acting are this strong.",The Final Girls

The movie transitions between comedy, drama and even action quite seamlessly, though make no mistake, this is most definitely a comedy! It also constantly avoids and follows several clichés, i didn't expect it to work so well but it did!

155,wjets9,A Classic In Both Horror and Comedy,10,16 November 2015,"Classic. This word describes this movie. It is chalk-full of tributes to the beauty of old slasher films (in particular Friday the 13th) as well as a self aware spoof.The basic premise is, a group of friends go to see an old slasher film starring the main girl's deceased mother. At said screening, an accident leads to the group being sucked into the horror movie, Camp Bloodbath. The initial plan of the group is to let the movie play out, and stick with the girl who eventually kills the killer, Billy. Obviously said plan does not work out and they then just try to survive until the end of the movie.Now this is a spoof done right. While it is primarily a spoof of Friday the 13th, it contains many elements from other classic horror movies. The entire initial plan of the group in itself is to stick with the virgin because everybody who has sex in a horror movie gets killed. Another way this movie spoofs classic horror movies is that it basically rips a character straight out of Scream in Duncan, almost the exact same character as Randy. Past this, the ways that the seemingly dead killer comes back to life, the jump scare through a window, seemingly invincible killer and when the characters physically point out clichés such as slow-motion and black and white flashbacks.Beyond the star power in the casting with big names like Malin Akerman, Nina Dobrev and comedy heavy-weight Adam DeVine, the acting still holds up. The special affects aren't a huge part of the movie, however they are good when used. The scripting and screenplay are absolutely unreal and certainly deserve accolades.Overall, this movie gets a must watch label for anybody who is a fan of horror or comedy and is an overall enjoyable experience for anybody.",The Final Girls

Its shot in an interesting way, too. There is this effect with the camera flying around the room. But its done quickly and it never loses focus.I wonder how they accomplished those shots. Without spoiling it too much, the story is about a young girl who has a horror B movie star for a mother, and this young girl manages to be absorbed into one of her mother's horror movies.I know this sounds similar to the plot of ""The last action hero.""

162,Voklova,A rare moment when a horror film NEEDS A SEQUEL,10,5 January 2020,"The Final Girls is a very unique horror flick that stands out against the pact of other bloody wannabes within the horror genre. Mixing both comedy and horror, the film does an excellent job at keeping the audience off their phones and glued to the screen by both making them laugh and tense causing whomever is viewing to yell and urge the characters to avoid getting killed. With obvious nods to 80s slasher films *cough cough Friday the 13th, the film itself is able to maintain a tense emotion, towards the later half of the film, without relying on the gimmicks that gave 80s slasher films their status (ex. bloody gore, nudity). Instead, this film centres most of its attention around the mother and daughter love that befalls the main protagonist as she is given a second chance to reunite with her deceased mother. With both spoofs of what makes up a horror movie (flashbacks, stereotypical horror film characters, a game plan to escape etc.) a blend of an 80s like feel, and an original story plot with some modern influences, this film certainly gives the viewer a positive impression once the credits roll. Not only that but it also does an interesting job on predicting what modern day teenagers would do, act and speak in contrast to people of the same age back in the 80s.Amazing production in terms of lighting and film shots, dialogue and incorporations of vintage throwbacks. In addition to that, the films ending does an excellent job of tying up loose knots efficiently without making the audience confused, disappointed or enraged, while at the same time make those watching beg to see more.All in all DEFINITE RECOMMEND. With its incorporation of humour, this movie is a great pick for people who can't stand your standard bloody, scary or disturbing horror movie.",The Final Girls

What made them fun ? The inventive kills, the over the top bad dialogue, the campy mood, the silly acting, the music, the legendary killer, the gore , and the nudity. So can a PG-13 film successful spoof 80s slasher convention ? This film is proof that it can. You just have to realize that this is not a movie that pays homage to slasher films by recreating the same kind of film. Its a spoof of the silliness of 80s horror. The characters are all likable, and all the actors are well cast. The story line is very clever. And while it may not be the first movie to deconstruct and bend horror film rules, it is one of the best.

Better timing should have been after ""Scream"" and before ""The Cabin in the Woods""; the latter movie took this kind of self-referential horror movies to a whole new and unique level, which ""The Final Girls"" can't match.The only other problem I can find is that it isn't very scary at all. We have a lot of suspense but it never pay off in a horrific way, because almost every physical attack and all violence occur out of frame or at distance. Probably the movie makers wanted to avoid a higher ranking than PG-13 at a theatric release, but now it went straight to DVD and some stronger scenes could have been inserted for good measure.But I forget the lack of real horror in this flick.

173,daydreammaggs,Could have been better,6,8 December 2020,"I've never heard of this movie till I saw it on Hulu this month. I love a good horror comedy, so I gave it go. However, it was a little disappointing to watch. Because of the PG-13 rating, they can't show any of the 'staples' of a teen slasher flick, like the nudity and gore. I think they could have kept in PG-13 if they at least alluded to those scenes properly. Perhaps a sex scene starts as the camera tilts away to look at them in shock as the killer is closing in. There are also a lot of pacing issues. The movie starts out strong, but there a lot of lulls in between action-packed scenes that drag the pace down to a crawl. Which would be fine.....if this was a horror-drama. But it's supposed to be a comedy. Where's the comedy? The other main drawback is that the main character that we are supposed to be rooting for is a mary-sue. I think you could replace Max with a robot and the robot would have a better personality. The whole point of the 'final girl' is that she's supposed to be the most interesting and complex character. They are supposed to know the games of the villain and be able to outsmart and battle them. Also....they are the 'final' girl for a reason. I'm looking at you, random love interest that somehow lives in the end.... Honestly, if you're looking for a pg/pg-13 love letter to teen slasher flicks, literally just watch the Hook, Line, and Screamer episode of Total Drama Island.

176,martinjohann-22063,Great surprise!,8,4 October 2021,"What really started as a cheesy slasher thriller ended with a good feeling.The story is about a girl who loses her mother in a tragic accident. The mother is a famous actress who was in a slasher; ""Camp Bloodbath"".Years later, the daughter is confronted with the film when a friend asks her if she wants to join a screening of the above film.Under an accident where the cinema is on fire, they survive by cutting up canvas and going in through.The young people end up inside the film and will now try to survive but as many know, it is difficult to change the course of fate.The contrast between 80s young people and young people of our time is funny but also a little cheesy.However, it is good that other horror clichés are used here as a battle plan in the film, e.g. Where part of the plan to lure the killer, by letting a stripper and showing his breasts; Classic.Here it should be mentioned that the young people from the 80s talk and behave cheesy, because that was done in the old films and it works SO well in it that today's young people can play against it.That the daughter meets her mother's role made an impression, especially later in the film and both actors did well. Good chemistry and a little tear worthy.In fact, all the actors and protagonists delivered were bravura.The killer is a bootleg Jason Voorhees but instead of a hockey mask / potato sack, he wears a wooden mask. Not much to catch up on and not as bloody as one might think when someone is compared to Jason.This is due to the film's PG-13. However, it must be said that the killers work well enough that you do not notice it and it is really something you can take with you; The killer and the killers were not what you were looking for, they were the story.Without saying too much, I would recommend this movie and 8 stars is justified.Cool movie with atmosphere and not quite as transparent.And yes, Tina is best girl.

178,brianrosenthal82,"Not for your typical horror fan, but still an amazing little film!",8,11 October 2015,"""The Final Girls"" is easily the most unique ""comedy/horror"" film I've seen since ""Cabin in the Woods"". The story, which takes some heavy cues from ""Last Action Hero"" and even ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" (to a degree), sees its heroin and her friends magically plunged into the world of the very slasher film her late mother starred in-- a film heavily inspired by ""Friday the 13th"". From there, it's a fun, clever romp as the group of modern college kids have to outwit the masked killer, while playing with/against the tropes and clichés of every 80s horror film you've ever seen. It's a lot of fun, and it's all executed with a deft creative hand. The heart of the story, however, lies with the female protagonist and her mission to save the ""movie version"" of her late mother-- who tragically died in the ""real"" world, but is alive and well within the film, albeit as the character she played. It's incredibly touching, and it got me more than a little teary-eyed. Which brings me to the film's biggest problem-- It's supposed to be a comedy/horror, and while it's a TON of fun and the yucks are aplenty, it doesn't really work as a horror film, much in the same way ""Last Action Hero"" didn't really work as an action film (falls on the side of parody too much). The kills are few and far between, and when they do happen, they're strangely bloodless and subdued (found out later this was due to a PG-13 rating). That leaves the film with 2 major things going for it: The meta-comedy, and the feels. This is ultimately not a film for your typical horror fan... it takes a special kind of appreciation. That said, even with some flaws (lack of scares being the biggest sin), this is a masterfully executed tribute to 80s slasher cinema, and a movie I won't soon be forgetting. Excellent script, excellent performances, visually amazing with VERY unique cinematography throughout, and above all, it's got SO much heart. 3 out of 4 stars, really loved this one.",The Final Girls

The overall construct (today's teens get stuck in an 80ies slasher movie) is neat and played well - including the use of black and white flashbacks which first intrude unexpectedly and are then actively used by the protagonists. The acting of the ""movie characters"" is pleasantly bad and overdone, and the cast generally is good. Bonus points for not leaving it at the overall construct, but adding a framing story of loss and giving us a (minimal) reason to care for some characters.Deductions for the lack of gratuitous nudity, sex and actual gore. Come on, it you want to stay true to the genre, then those are a requirement! (If you want to update this, why not throw in some male nudity to balance things out?

184,nicholasjkoss,Wasted Potential,6,13 August 2016,"First off, I actually enjoyed the film quite a bit, but there were rarely moments that I thought were that clever. The premise was interesting enough. I thought they could've done so much more with the film. There were tons of opportunities for intriguing scenes, but the writing and direction didn't really deliver in any of the concepts. The story is fun for a quick watch if you're bored, but don't go into it expecting much else than a few laughs.As for the production, everything was done well enough. The CGI isn't very good, but it's not a movie where that really matters honestly. The cinematography can go from really good to uninspired within each scene. I didn't think the acting was horrible. It was supposed to be cheesy and bad like classic horror movies, I just thought that they went a little too far in some places with how poor the dialogue was. None of the characters were that interesting which was disappointing because I thought the film was supposed to be a spin on the usually cliché horror films.The comedy in the film wasn't that strong unfortunately. I think most of the times I laughed were from jokes that were already in the trailers. I do have to admit that the outtake reel at the end of the film is pretty funnier. A lot of those moments during the credits are much funnier than the rest of the film.There are also supposed to be some heartfelt moments in the film, and to be fair some of those attempts are pulled off well, but a lot of the time it fell a flat because they didn't develop the characters enough for me to really care about them.Overall, I just wished they would have explored the ideas they presented in better detail. I think if they were aiming to create a fun movie that pokes fun at horror films and tries to be something new, they didn't do a great job.

So when this came on cable one night, I didn't even plan to watch the whole thing, much less to get sucked in and enjoy it as much as I did.But I did. I did get sucked in right from the beginning, aided by the film's opening ten minutes or so and the knowledge (which I learned when I looked up the movie online) that it was written by the son of Jason Miller (Father Karras in The Exorcist) in part as a tribute to his late father. I thought that was touching and interesting, and the delightful cast and unique set-up of this film made me decide to ""just give it a few more minutes.""Those ""few more minutes"" ended with me watching the whole movie, thoroughly enjoying myself as the jokes and references crossed my screen...and then with me literally crying, sobbing, when the film reached its emotional climax.I cannot say enough about Malin Akerman's performance here. Through the whole movie she has a tough line to walk, portraying an innocent young girl who is also (through the magic of film) a mother forever separated from the daughter she loves. Perhaps it is because I am myself the mother of two daughters; perhaps I was simply a little extra emotional that night. I do not know. All I know is that I cried. Hard. Watching Akerman's face as ""Bette Davis Eyes"" plays (I'm trying to avoid spoilers here), the way it shifts from happy and reassuring to, for the briefest moment, terror, then to resolution, courage, and happy reassurance again just broke me. I have always liked Akerman, but never saw such depths in her work before. She deserves recognition for it, because she reached right into my chest and squeezed my heart, hard.All of the performances in this film are excellent, in fact. There are a number of surprisingly deep and subtle moments for a slasher film, and a number of laughs--perhaps not minutes-long belly laughs, but I was amused and at least chuckled a number of times. The flashbacks were especially clever, I thought, and yes, while I (as a child of the 70s/80s) knew that ""Cherry Pie"" was anachronistic, the scene and moment were so fun that I didn't care. I'd imagine someone who's seen lots of 80's slashers would find even more in-jokes and references than I did. The cast overall is charming, and appear to be having so much fun that you can't help but have fun, too.It's an entertaining film with a surprisingly emotional heart, and the performances (again, especially Akerman) are excellent. You could do worse than adding this to your Halloween horror list--but have some Kleenex handy, just in case.(For any others reading this who aren't big fans of slashers, I also recommend ""Happy Death Day,"" another ""slasher"" type movie with an interesting twist, a lot of humor, and delightful performances.)",The Final Girls
189,lbellcoder,Great until the end.,7,28 January 2020,"This was a great movie that was pretty original. However the ending was kind of bad. I was expecting her to wake up from it all being a dream as it implied ""Nancy"" knew she was Max's mom and was telling Max to let her go in her grieving process. No, all the people who were brutally murdered and blown up magically appeared for a probably terrible sequel that wouldn't make sense. I know people like the unpredictable twists but sometimes they are just stupid.",The Final Girls
190,barrettr-02411,Emotion Thriving,10,7 April 2019,"Out of the dozens of on end horror and slasher movies I've seen, I've never seen one capture emotion so brilliantly. One of the best films I've seen in a while.",The Final Girls
191,krnkissinger,Meets the expectations,9,3 August 2021,"I thought this movie was going to be a fun, campy, deconstruction of horror movie tropes like Cabin in the Woods. Seeing the cast I had faith they could pull it off with the right blend of professionalism and goof. I was rewarded with that expectation being met.",The Final Girls
192,Tickdingler,Crap,1,3 June 2021,"You dont need this. Characters aren't funny when they try to be. Jock guy playing the same character yet again like in every other film or TV show he is in.Killer is Jason from Friday the 13th, but to avoid copyright, he wasnt drowned but burned instead.Completely lost interest after they went in to the main bit of the story. No actual explanation of why they were there.Summary. Dont bother unless you wanna waste an hour and half of your life.",The Final Girls
193,juanm-92838,A fun watch,8,25 July 2021,"Still a little sad they wouldn't go all the way with an R rating, if only to enhance the feeling of danger. But even without that, it's still a great story and a really fun watch that will occasionally pull at your heart stings.",The Final Girls
194,joannafee21,UNDERRATED,9,24 January 2021,I did not expect this film to be what it was. I am not a fan of horror films but I love comedy. I like Adam Devine and his aura and I like Tessa's history as well. The movie was completely hilarious and unexpected. I think I had a smile on my face the entire time (except for the necessary heartfelt scenes). Alia Shawkat is an underrated actress and needs more leading roles. Great film I could watch twice a day.,The Final Girls
195,rmacnichol-68374,Not what anyone expected,10,9 December 2020,As I read the reviews it dawned on me how many people missed the true point of this movie. It's a drama about loss and acceptance hidden in a teen horror comedy that pays homage to 80s slasher films. That's what makes this movie work. The dynamic chemistry between Max and her mom and how it changes and evolves really brings it home.,The Final Girls
