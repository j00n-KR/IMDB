0,SnoopyStyle,Guys still lovable goofs but this is too awkward,5,29 May 2014,"Billy McMahon (Vince Vaughn) and Nick Campbell (Owen Wilson) are manufacturer reps for a watch company. The company goes out of business. They're somewhat obsolete. Billy loses his girlfriend and his house is in foreclosure. Nick takes a bad mattress sales job. Then Billy looking for sales jobs on Google comes up with an idea. He's able to convince Nick to take a big swing.This is awkward and not always funny. The guys have always had good chemistry. That hasn't change in this movie, but it doesn't mean that you can drop them anywhere doing whatever Vince Vaughn comes up with. At least, the guys are still the same lovable goofs. Sometimes their stupidity is funny. Other times, it's just stupid. Then there are the times when it gets real awkward. Part of that is that this is a 2 hour commercial for Google. I know product placement is everywhere nowadays, but this product is all over the place... man!",The Internship
1,Hitchcoc,Saw It on a Plane,5,3 January 2014,"I don't mean to be cruel. I like Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson. This, however, offers absolutely no surprises as it reprises every underdog movie ever done. Nothing wrong with underdog movies if there is a unique spark. Not to be. The character are mere caricatures. Since Revenge of the Nerds we have been treated (sorry, bad use of the word) to sports films, sexual discovery films, and so on, which titillate and hope to gain the attention of those of us who are not handsome or beautiful or rich or whatever. Of course, they are the people that all these guys would choose to be if they could. So we have the usual nose-pickers, shy, frightened, socially inept cases of arrested development, hidden geniuses, and then the old guys who somehow found their ways into the Google infrastructure. This is no work of art so lets not criticize it as if it were Citizen Kane. Its a silly, haphazard, unbelievable series of events. It's like eating too much dessert. It tasted good, but you don't feel all that good.",The Internship
2,Prismark10,Yahoo!,5,24 July 2014,"The Internship AKA a corporate ad for Google. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn team up again as two out of work salesmen who end up competing for a job at Google but they have to compete with younger and more IT literate geeks in the internship program at Googleplex. The duo are regarded as figures of fun and over the hill and end up teaming up with other misfits as no one else wants them.In the film Google is a hip place to work, it might be true, all I know is that they do indeed have a free café for food.Vaughn who also co-wrote the film has an easy way with Wilson, so they should given the number of films they have made together. Will Ferrell pops up in a cameo. Max Mingehella plays their rival who will stop at nothing for his team to win. Aasif Mandvi is the Head of Internship Program who seems to be antagonistic towards our duo.The film is rather predictable. You have the less tech savvy Wilson and Vaughn trying to bond with their team, their trump card is that they have real life experiences. Eventually they start giving Minghella's team a run for the shot at winning the internship but there are ups and down as well as a romance side plot. At the same time there are various digs at Google as a slightly eccentric place to work for.The film is sporadically funny, just about charming but a tad too cosy and predictable. There are few surprises, in fact its more Windows than Apple!",The Internship
3,claudio_carvalho,Terrible Propaganda,3,1 November 2014,"The watches' salesmen Billy ""Billy"" McMahon (Vince Vaughn) and Nick Campbell (Owen Wilson) lose their jobs when the company where they work is sold for losing market for the cellular. Billy and Nick do not have skills but Billy fills the application for a summer internship at Google. The candidates are divided into groups and Billy and Nick join the team of outcast. Now they need to win the tough competition against brilliant college students to be definitely hired by the company. ""The Internship"" is a terrible propaganda of Google, with a lame story that uses clichés. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are great comedians but this wrong marketing is too silly, absurd, long, illogic and annoying. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Os Estagiários"" (""The Interns"")",The Internship
4,nogodnomasters,THE FUTURE DOESN'T KNOW LATER,8,2 August 2018,"Two dinosaur salesmen (Vince Vaughn/ Owen Wilson) find themselves as interns at Google. They are fish out of water as they have to deal with the youth and terminology of the tech world. They are divided into teams with our duo on the misfit team which leads to formulaic results.This is a fun film which doesn't offend. The humor is not overwhelmingly laugh out loud, by rather tritely funny. That is not to say it is bad, but simply lacks originality.Worth a view. Makes for a good rental.Parental Guide rated version: 2 f-bombs, No sex or nudity. Strip club scene.",The Internship
5,kosmasp,By the numbers,6,13 October 2013,"Internship is funny and it might work better or worse for you depending if you like the main actors or not. It has some very funny scenes and even the construction itself does work, even though you do know where it all is going to (predictable would be the word you're looking for in that case).Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson have a great chemistry, they do exactly what you'd expect them to do (actually Vince hasn't surprised anyone in years, either amused or annoyed the viewers). Some of the supporting cast is really nice though. We have one guy who is a regular at the Today Show (with Jon Stewart), who has only a few scenes, but is funny as hell (as expected, too), but the rest of the bunch does have their fair share of moment to shine too. If you can sit through the obvious, you'll have fun",The Internship
6,lee_eisenberg,interns of the future,5,14 December 2013,"""The Internship"" is an unpretentiously silly story of some friends who intern at Google. Like many flicks starring Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn and company, it's mainly an excuse for gags. The rest of the cast includes ""The Daily Show"" correspondent Aasif Mandvi as the supervisor who gives the teams the job of developing an app.We could be cynical and say that much of the movie is the same stuff that we saw in ""Wedding Crashers"". I beg to differ. While there is a lot of the same stuff, ""The Internship"" really does its own stuff. A lot of the humor derives from the age difference between Wilson's and Vaughn's characters, and the rest of the employees. Funny stuff. I enjoyed the movie, and you probably will too.I guess that it would be a little ironic if a person Googled this movie.",The Internship
7,paul_haakonsen,You on the line...?,5,5 October 2013,"I can't really claim to be much fan of neither Wilson nor Vaughn, but still their movies tend to be alright, and as such, then I sat down to watch ""The Internship"".For a comedy, then the laughs were really, really far apart. Don't get me wrong here, I am not saying that the movie is boring or bad, not at all, but it is definitely not the kind of comedy that will have you laughing yourself to tears. The story was nice enough, but what really carried the movie was the characters and the acting.The story in ""The Internship"" is about Billy McMahon (played by Vince Vaughn) and Nick Campbell (played by Owen Wilson), two salesmen who find themselves without a job. And find themselves bustling hard to get through an internship at Google, banded together with a group of younger and more technical-minded people.I will say that I found the characters tremendously well portrayed, and they were were full of dimension and personalities. And as such, it really helped the movie along quite nicely. And the chemistry between everyone was just great.If you find yourself without something to do for about 119 minutes, then ""The Internship"" could be a good enough way to pass the time. I am rating ""The Internship"" a 5 out of 10 rating. This mediocre rating comes from a lack of comedy in the entire movie, and what kept the movie afloat was the characters and the people portraying these characters.",The Internship
8,tavm,"The Internship is an okay comedy, just don't expect non-stop laughs",5,17 June 2013,"Let me state right off the bat that I like both Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. I loved them both in Wedding Crashers. That was a very funny movie. This one, not so much, and because it's rated PG-13 and not R, there isn't as much raunch as in WC. Actually, this one is supposed to be even more of a nice vibe between comedy and sweetness than WC and I actually liked that. But I'd be lying if I didn't say that I didn't find much that was funny during many of the beginning scenes. It did pick up much near the end and overall, The Internship wasn't too bad. Part of me wouldn't even mind seeing it again if asked. Just don't expect a non-stop laugh-getter is all I'm sayin'...",The Internship
9,edwagreen,***,7,12 August 2014,"Comical film dealing with sudden out of work salesmen who embark on a new career by becoming interns for Google in an attempt to gain employment with this internet provider.Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn were great salesmen but realize that they must come to grips with today's society and use of computers to gain attention.They employ unconventional methods to attain their goals along with a group of young people they are grouped with when no one wants to work with them.This is basically a story of perseverance and doing unconventional things in a conventional world.Of course, there is the usual romance and attempts by others to sabotage their efforts.

10,sunwarrior13,A Google Advertisement,8,14 April 2014,"The Internship is a comedy that stars Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson.It tells a story about two men who lost their jobs as a salesmen and were hired as interns at Google.The film was shot at real-life headquarters of Google at Mountain View,California. Billy McMahon and Nick Campbell seek employment after being laid off from their positions.They apply for an internship at Google and they were surprisingly accepted due to their unexpected answers that pleased the job interviewer.Unfortunately,they are the only interns that are not of College age.They join with other interns that are considered rejects such as Stuart,Yo-Yo and Neha.They form a team that will compete for guaranteed jobs with the company.During the competition against other tech-savvy groups,both Vaughn and Wilson work on their comedic skills and charm to elicit laughter to the viewers.Then guess what?In the end,every viewer knows who among the groups will be will get the coveted job at Google.Obviously,the film is predictable and generic.Too bad that both Vaughn and Wilson do not generate that much interest to the viewer especially when most of their comedic scenes fall short of laughter unlike in their previous movie entitled,The Wedding Crashers.Also,it drags a lot and I considered it overlong.Overall,it just served as a 120-minute Google commercial and nothing more.But if you are a fan of both actors,this film is definitely for you.",The Internship

12,utgard14,Formula comedy is amusing at times,5,3 November 2013,"This is a formula ""back to school"" type of comedy with lots of product placement and two aging stars going through the motions. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson play the same roles they've played for most of the last decade -- themselves. If you are a big fan of them you can add a point or two to my score because they're the whole show here. The rest of the cast is made up of mostly unknowns playing various stereotypes that are familiar to anybody who has seen a high school or college comedy. They do fine and there are no standouts, good or bad, among them. John Goodman appears in a thankless supporting role. Will Ferrell does one of his usual cameos he does in the movies of his friends. He's worth a chuckle or two. Like I said, the movie is formulaic and predictable but it has a very pleasant upbeat tone throughout and quite a few amusing moments but nothing that will have you bowled over in laughter. There's a ton of product placement for Google. Literally the whole movie. So if that sort of thing bothers you, you might want to skip this one and save yourself the righteous indignation.",The Internship
13,zardoz-13,"Not A Tenth As Good As ""The Wedding Crashers""",5,17 June 2013,"The Vince Vaughn & Owen Wilson generation gap comedy ""The Internship"" is essentially crap. This lame-brained comedy isn't a tenth as hilarious as their first movie together ""Wedding Crashers."" Indeed, this lowest common denominator laffer about two desperate 'old school' clock salesmen who don't even know their own company has folded is nothing special. Vaughn relies on his obnoxious motor-mouth skills to generate humor, while Wilson deploys his blonde, surfer dude good looks to hook women. ""Date Night"" director Shaun Levy doesn't get much mileage out of anything in this predictable but harmless farce about diversity in the workplace. The surprises and revelations in ""The Internship"" qualify as few and far between, and the outcome isn't quite as tantalizing as it could have been. Vaughn penned the screenplay with the help of Jared Stern from his own story. Nothing in ""The Internship"" stands out, except for the grueling efforts that our protagonists go to so they can rejuvenate their careers. The jokes, the gags, and the dialogue are rather bland, and our heroes achieve their objective without too many problems. Neither Vaughn nor Levy are willing to buck the clichés and try for something a bit more interesting and relevant for contemporary audiences.",The Internship
14,grantss,Quickly becomes formulaic,5,5 May 2014,"So-so comedy. Had potential but quickly became formulaic. The original idea was a good one - 40-somethings having to find their way in a 20-somethings industry - and the dialogue was initially quite funny and fresh. However, from a point the movie ran out of original ideas and just retreaded the same IT jokes. (Unfortunately, that point was sooner, rather than later, in the movie). Worse than that, it adopted a stock- standard, done-a-thousand-times-before, comedy plot. Very predictable and unoriginal, ultimately.Other irritating thing is that it seems like one huge advertisement for Google. They could at least have invented a fictitious IT company.Performances are nothing to write home about. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson do their best but are constrained by the script. Rose Byrne deserves a whole lot better kind of movie than this.",The Internship
15,neil-476,"Pleasing, if insubstantial",8,5 July 2013,"40-somethings Billy and Nick are brilliant salesmen, but that counts for nothing when their employer shuts down. Needing to find what to do next, they try out for the intern program at Google, where they end up applying their life skills and experiences as part of a team of misfits.My experience has been that both Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson are lazy actors - they play the same parts and give the same performances in every film, and The Internship does not overturn that formula. However, they also have an easy and likable chemistry as we saw in the Wedding Crashers, and this works well for them here. This is a gentle, likable comedy, where most of the characters are pleasant company, the chuckles are frequent and the smiles constant, the moral statements worth making and fairly subtly delivered, and the romance (Wilson and Rose Byrne) nicely played.By no means a classic, neither is it in any way offensive (apart from a single unwelcome F-bomb). I positively enjoyed it.",The Internship
16,anaconda-40658,A Bad Internship.,4,24 June 2015,"Internship (2013): Dir: Shawn Levy / Cast: Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Rose Byrne, Max Minghella, Josh Gad: Wedding Crashers is one of the best comedies of the 2000's. How unfortunate that it is followed up with this boring laughless tripe about connection. While Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson were witty and hysterical in the previous film, here they are bland. They play a couple of salesmen who sell watches until they are let go when it is figured that the I-Phone has replaced watches. On a fluke they decide to apply as interns at Google. While the premise has potential it is followed up with formula writing and characters who make up every stereotype and moron that they could conjure up. Rose Byrne catches Wilson's eye and immediately comes off as a tight ass with a stick wedged up her crack until he predictably breaks the barrier. Max Minghella plays an over the top bully competitor who desires the job prospects of Google and will sabotage when opportunity presents itself. It is unfortunate that he went from The Social Network to this. Vaughn and Wilson are placed in a group with imbeciles. We have the uptight jerk whom they try to befriend. We have the virgin female. We have Lyle who talks in the third person because he is an irritating peon. A scene at a strip club where he gets the stripper is embarrassing with its idiotic bar fight. The biggest idiot discusses his abusive mother and pulls his eye brows out. After being part of this travesty, he will likely be pulling his hair out. The theme of technology and age is strong but the screenplay is so pathetic that it is enough to make viewers pull their eye brows out. Score: 4 / 10",The Internship
17,FlashCallahan,On the line.....,6,13 October 2013,"Billy and Nick are old school salesmen. They find themselves out of a job when the company they work for closes. They try to find jobs but because of their age, it's not easy. Billy gets them a chance to work at Google but they first have to undergo a long internship and find themselves teamed with others who are younger than them. They compete against other teams, and only one team will be hired. But there is always that English lad with thick eyebrows who tries to ruin it for the 2004 stars.....Its easy, if you can tolerate Vince Vaughn, the fact that its just one Ad campaign for Google, and the gaping audacity of it all, its watchable. Its easier for me, because I wasn't a fan of the wedding crashers. In fact, that's one of the most overrated movies I've ever seen, so my expectations were lowered for this, and it got everything I expected to get from this movie.Ageism, other interns hating the two stars, bonding, one standout awful person, the two giving others life lessons, something going wrong, a love sub-plot, and obviously the feel good ending.Its one of those films you can put on and just let happen, because it displays every known trope these kind of films have to offer.It's not funny, I didn't laugh once, but with Vaughn and Wilson, you know what your going to get.Not brilliant, but never dull.",The Internship
18,phd_travel,Funnier than expected - not painful or goofy,8,2 September 2013,"This film could easily have been painful or goofy but it wasn't. In fact the dialog is laugh out loud funny in many parts. Two laid off slightly advanced salesmen take on an internship in Google. As expected the pairing of Owen and Vince works again. Somehow the mixed bag of Asian and other nerds is endearing. It's fun to see the lovely Rose Byrne using her Aussie accent and Max Minghella his British accent. Surprising to see Jessica Szhor as the hot dancer. Nice shooting in the Bay area.Vince did a good job with the writing and aside from the generational jokes, the X Men joke and the ""awful"" date are quite hilarious. It shows you don't need to resort to excessive crudeness to get a laugh these days. Nice change from the Hangover type comedies.Definitely worth a watch.",The Internship

The x generation meets the modern cyber adults of today. 1980s' old school fish out of water character are pitted against the cyber intellectual bullies of today's modern world. When I went back to school I had a similar experience. What makes the Internship work is comic themes of dealing with free food, ethics of drinking with your boss, and a silly love interest. The Internship is a coming together movie. Where real life is tested against cyber life. E Q vs I Q. People taking chances in life. I liked the internship.

Its interesting to see its aging protagonists having fun & emerging victorious against the youngsters. The characters work & so does the narrative.Vince Vaughn & Jared Stern's Screenplay surrenders to clichés at times, but is well-done otherwise. Shawn Levy's Direction is appropriate. Cinematography & Editing, are average. Performance-Wise: Vince Vaughn & Owen Wilson are very good. Also, they share a wonderful chemistry on-screen, just like they did years back in Wedding Crashers. Max Minghella is convincing in a menacing part. Rose Byrne looks gorgeous & delivers a restrained performance. Aasif Mandvi is impressive. John Goodman & Will Ferrell are terrific in cameos. On the whole, 'The Internship' works.",The Internship
21,StevePulaski,A fairly smart movie disguised as a stupid one,8,23 October 2013,"The Internship is a fairly smart movie disguised as a stupid one. It's too bad that many audience members saw the stupidity and judged the film entirely on that, rather than listening to what the film actually had to say. The film is by no stretch great and often becomes too obsessed with crude humor and directionless crassness. However, when the film recognizes that it's material is relevant and relatable to an older public is when the film becomes more of a moderately-successful venture than a mediocre comedy.The relevancy I'm talking about is the current age where people of an older demographic are having difficultly finding jobs with the recent onslaught of technology and the rather quick, uncomfortable hustle of the digital age. The film stars Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, two actors I've always appreciated, as Billy and Nick, two watch salesman who catch up with the times in the regard that their company has been made obsolete because people - even their own salesman - check their phones for the time rather than a wristwatch. Upon being fired, they each seek out their own methods of employment, until Billy encourages Nick to participate in an internship with him for the web search engine Google.The issue with this is that Billy and Nick are pushing forty. They are not up to date with technology, but are seduced by promises of high pay and Google's accolades as being the best company to work for in the modern age. Upon arriving to Google, Billy and Nick realize their main competition is new-graduates and college-aged kids who are way more brushed up on the internet than they'll ever be. As Nick puts it, the internship is a ""mental Hunger Games"" with young kids, as everyone is divided up into small groups and forced to compete in challenges all across the board in order to assure the most diligent and accomplished worker be awarded with the job.Writers Vince Vaughn and Jared Stern scarcely stray from formula here. They keep everything light, breezy, but always high-spirited, as Billy and Nick go through the familiar movie-cycles of being fishes out of water, the laughing stock, and then fully-realized as dedicated human beings that can win challenges and pose a serious threat to the young-bloods competing for the same internship. It is when Vaughn and Stern recognize the potential of their material that maximum potency for The Internship is reached. They show that, in this day and age, older men and women are shunned, either because they come with a heavy price-tag due to their experience, are feared for their potential health problems, or lack technology skills in the digital age. The film shows the duo's willingness to do well but their ultimate failure in some fields. However, the writers don't hesitate to show the detached, cynical youth who think they know everything because of the device in their pockets. One character brings up a believable justification to the culture's cynicism - the world's increasing vigor and the competition for every job available. After all, he's one of dozens competing for an internship at Google, performing back-breaking acts of labor and competition to try and secure a job in what will be an unbelievably competitive company.The Internship, for a heavy-budget summer comedy that can easily be mistaken for two-hour product placement for Google, actually brings up viable points that cater to both the older generation and the younger and how technology, while making each party's life easier, has made it more frustrating and complex. The only real detraction to the material is its stupidity can get to the point where it nearly compromises the film. Many jokes fall flat, but surprisingly, the sentiment and emotional leverage that comes in at the end feels authentic and possesses the ability to be believed. For mainstream comedies, this is usually reversed. But, as one can infer, this isn't your typical summer comedy.I must conclude on a rather odd note. From seeing the first trailer to now seeing the film, I must identify a criminally misguided joke that has bothered me for months now. In their first few minutes at Google, Billy and Nick meet Lyle (Josh Brener from those Samsung commercials they use to play in cinemas), a well-meaning geek who has worked at Google for years now. The film tries to make the joke when Lyle first greets Billy and Nick that he's socially inept and doesn't really know how to properly greet someone. He holds his knuckles, hoping to engage in a first-bump with the guys, and says, ""Pound me. C'mon, bro, fist me, get up in there."" Obviously the joke is showing his inability to connect with people at first sight and his ignorance towards word-choice. However, The Internship is trying to portray the ineptitude of Billy and Nick, who are, as said, fishes out of water in a new company driven by younger souls. Shouldn't they be the ones telling Lyle to fist them? Starring: Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Josh Brener, Rose Byrne, and John Goodman. Directed by: Shawn Levy.",The Internship
22,KineticSeoul,Cliché and very weak,2,29 October 2013,"I found nothing about this flick to be humorous or entertaining. It's not even a feel good movie. It's like Vince Vaughn got some backing from google and thus decided to make this movie. And because he probably wanted to make another team-up movie with Owen Wilson, like in ""Wedding Crasher"". This flick is generic when it comes to these types of comedies as it gets. If you seen a lot of adult comedies, you won't be missing out on anything with this. It's like they took bits and pieces of other comedies and mashed it into the most formulaic way possible. It's just a super cookie-cutter flick that is forced in every way possible. Just because characters talk really fast with one another in a obnoxious manner with awkward expressions does not necessarily make it funny. I was just plain out bored with this movie. Even the bonding elements is so weak. So they go to a strip club and it's like they all become friends all of a sudden. Yeah, people can make sarcastic references to this. But that is just it, it's weak. This movie could have probably been a G flick if it wasn't for that strip club scene. The humor is just childish with no wit to it. This one is just a waste of time. It's around two hours long, but felt way longer and should have been cut down. Watch ""Monsters University"" instead.2.5/10",The Internship
23,OllieSuave-007,"Idiotic mostly, but a somewhat better second half.",5,14 October 2014,"This is one of those digital age-crazed movies, a story about two recently laid off salesmen Billy McMahon and Nick Campbell (Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson) who attempt to land themselves a job in the digital world through an internship at Google, where they must compete with young, tech-savvy and sometimes nerdy 20-something year-olds for a shot at employment at the company. Teams are formed among the interns to compete in challenges for the employment and Billy and Nick are teamed with Stuart, Neha, Yo-Yo and team leader Lyle.This movie started off pretty much idiotic and ridiculous. Much of the young people were portrayed as entitled, cynical and condescending know-it-alls who think they have all the answers to Google's internship challenges. Some like the Lyle and Yo-Yo were stereotypically portrayed as extremely geeky and showed poor attempts in ""trying to fit in."" Stuart is like the typical smart-phone user who acts as if the world doesn't exist outside the small device and Neha tries too hard to have the bratty, valley girl syndrome. The entire showcase of the Google headquarters was just intimidating with those oddball furniture and splats of colors everywhere. I almost turned off the movie after seeing the weird and awkward sports game scene.However, after watching Billy and Nick starting to get along with their challenge team, with messages of sportsmanship and teamwork actually setting in, I gave the movie another shot and discovered the second half actually works better than the first half. The teams competing against each other in the hot-line and sales challenges were pretty captivating to watch, and Billy's attempts to redeem himself (and his team) for his past failures added some intrigue to the plot.The attempts at crude sexual humor and the strip club scene were a little too much, but the movie does have a pretty fascinating finish during the announcement of ***spoiler ahead*** the winning group of the challenges. ***spoiler ends*** Overall, it's a tacky and ridiculous movie with some forced some feel-good moments. The movie could have been a lot better if the characters were made more genuine and likable.Grade D+",The Internship

25,Robert_duder,An awful mess that needed years of editing,4,22 October 2013,"After the hilarious Wedding Crashers it would only make sense that Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughan would team up again. The biggest issue that reeks about The Internship is how sloppy and poor and irritating the script is. On top of that the directing is bad, and instead of being adorable and quirky Vaughan and Wilson are almost entirely annoying throughout the whole film. The great chemistry they had in Wedding Crashers is completely out the window. How unfortunate. The film tries so hard for the lovable losers learn about life angle but this doesn't even hold a candle to films like House Bunny or Miss Congeniality or Easy A or something like that. The dialogue in the film is literally painful to listen to. There is one speech after another of analogies and stupid rambling that simply isn't funny. I had pretty low expectations going into this because it tanked in the theatre and I am not a huge Vaughan fan or Wilson but I never dreamt it would be quite so intolerable. There are several scenes that are supposed to be uplifting and inspiring and they simply aren't. Now saying all that the ending scenes were a little better and redeemed some of the mess that preceded it. The supporting cast are okay but it would take a miracle to save this script.Vince Vaughan can be good or at least decent in the right role. His comedy has to be blue collar. What I mean is that you have to relate to him and he does his best when he's doing physical comedy and being goofy but lovable. He is barely tolerable in this film. He has zero good lines and the only time he even remotely shows that sort of Vaughan that is entertaining is when he's making a sales pitch. Ditto to Owen Wilson. Seriously...carbon copy that because he is the same deal in this. The supporting cast are all okay and honourable mention to Aasif Mandvi (very good as the straight laced leader who is as annoyed as I was with Vaughan and Wilson), Max Minghella (as the appropriately awful self-centred villain type character), Josh Brener (who was very underused throughout the film), and our three lovable loser crew played by Dylan O'Brien, Tiya Sircar and Tobit Raphael. They are very underused and underdeveloped as well so when they're aiming for the sweet lovable losers overcoming adversity angle, they just aren't important enough to the story. Watch for cameos by Josh Gad (small mostly unnoticeable role) and Will Ferrell in his usual silly dumb role. Rose Byrne, who can be a terrific actress, is completely underused and given absolutely nothing to work with as Wilson's romantic interest.I was actually genuinely surprised when I looked up the film makers and writers behind this. Vince Vaughan is actually the brain behind this script that needed about fourteen re-writes to be at least acceptable. It isn't exactly a brilliant concept and the script should not have been that hard to write. Either of the other films he has wrote or helped write were better than this. But I never considered Vince Vaughan to be some sort of brilliant talent. Shaun Levy on the other hand who is the director of this is so much better than what showed here. Levy has done some truly outstanding films. Real Steel? Amazing. The Pink Panther remake? Hilarious and done so well. The Night At The Museum films? Not my cup of tea but still well told and directed. I just don't believe Levy had a hand in this because it was a mess. There is a glimmer of hope in it, a few mildly funny lines and under all the mess you can see what could have been at least a fun movie. The last scene in the film is easily the best and finally shows what they were trying to get to all along. My point is that it could have actually been good if they worked on it much longer and much harder. As it is, I am convinced that they slapped it together because they were forced to at gunpoint.

26,bowmanblue,Did someone say 'Google?',6,13 May 2014,"One of the main problems with making a film which utilises a well-known brand as part of the story is that you get a little sick of the product after a while. Having spent watching two hours of 'The Internship' I really don't think I'll ever search the internet via Google again.The film is about Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson – a pair of salesmen who lose their jobs – and their attempts to get an internship at possibly the most famous web-based company to date, Google. So begins their 'hilarious' shenanigans at Google's headquarters. I put 'hilarious' in quote marks because the film is two hours. Two hours. To make anything 'hilarious' for two hours is a job harder than building up the world's most recognisable web search engine. And, sadly. The Internship doesn't really pull it off.It starts out with some promise, i.e. it's actually funny. However, as the two hours go by, the jokes get fewer and fewer and more time elapses when you get this real feeling of de ja vu. I can't put my finger on it, but the whole premise seems to have been done before. I don't know if the genre of film has an actual name, but it's basically one of those films where the team of misfit losers ends up learning to work together and beat every other team who are blatantly better and more organised than them – off the top of my head two types I can think of is 'Monsters: University' and 'The House Bunny.' Naturally, you have the 'bad' team of rival interns who, despite being the best, are also completely objectionable and full of themselves. Guess what... I wonder if they'll get what's coming to their smug faces throughout the story? Then you have the 'love interest' for Owen Wilson, who he 'romances' by basically stalking and annoying her until she falls madly in love with him.Ultimately, I saw The Internship like Google's 'anti-recruitment' video. Being as big as they are, they must get more than their fair share of job applicants, begging to work for them. Having watched the film, I think it could be the last place I'd ever want to work. Their 'recruitment process' involves all of the worst things you've ever been forced to do in the name of 'team bonding' on works outings, mixed with all those pointless and embarrassing activities you were made to do when you went to a job interview for a company who thought they were trendy.Bottom line: there just aren't enough laughs or originality to stretch this film out to two hours. Cut half an hour out here and there and you might have had a much better and tighter film. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off you search for other people's opinions on the film via AOL.",The Internship
27,MLDinTN,if you like dry humor...,6,7 April 2014,"then you'll like this. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are back with that same back and forth talking, dry humor. This time they are interns at Google, competing for a job. They are slick talking salesmen that need a new gig. So they team up with some smart teens and form a team competing for the google jobs. Chetty is their no-nonsense boss that acts like he thinks they are complete failures, but really thinks they got something no one else has. Then there is their competition that thinks he's better than everyone and has an English accent. He was good to poke fun at.FINAL VERDICT: Sort of funny, I'm sure if you like Vaughn or Wilson, you should check it out.",The Internship
28,g-bodyl,A Google Ad? So What......,9,17 September 2014,"The Internship is actually a cute, solid comedy that I was able to enjoy. Yes, it's clearly an hour and forty minute long Google ad, but I am not to be denied the awesome chemistry between Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. The movie actually shows a little about what it's like to work at Google and while you need the brains, it seems like a cool place. This film is led by the presence of Vaughn and Wilson and just like Wedding Crashers, they were able to make this a fun movie.Shawn Levy's film is about two aging salesmen who are fired from their job of selling wristwatches. Despite their age, they take an opportunity to intern at Google. Not liked at first, they are able to gain the trust of their fellow groupmates on their way to a possible full-time position at Google.As I mentioned before, this film is good primarily because of the charm and chemistry of Vaughn and Wilson. They may be in their forties, but they act a good deal younger than that. It was nice to see them come up with joke after joke, including some that reference X-Men and the Hunger Games. Rose Byrne does a good job as one of the leaders of Google who has gained the eyes of Wilson.Overall, The Internship is a solid, sweet comedy that is actually a lot better that one would think. It's definitely a Google ad, but the filmmakers were able to make a story out of that. It's just not about Google, but it's about cherishing your friends and making a family for life. It's a funny film, thanks to the talents of the funnymen. I rate this film 9/10.",The Internship

Billy finds them jobs at Google...well more internships to go through before they get jobs but it's really the same thing. Going in I had mixed feelings. I loved Wedding Crashers and did all I could to temper my expectations for this because Wedding Crashers is such a classic it would have been hard to compete with that one. Hard as I tried though I found myself comparing this to Wedding Crashers over and over, but in my defense many of the jokes and the way they act are pretty similar. I'm not saying this isn't funny because it is and I did laugh a lot but it wasn't nearly as good as Wedding Crashers and was incredibly predictable. All that said being a comedy those things are expected so I won't dock the movie for that. Overall, funny but disappointing when compared to the classic that is Wedding Crashers.

31,callanvass,Breezy fluff that is fairly entertaining. I got what I expected,6,31 January 2014,"Billy McMahon & Nick Campbell are salesmen who have to deal with the advanced technology. When they are told by their boss that they are dinosaurs, they are let go. Wanting to prove a point that they are not defunct, they manage to miraculously make it into an internship program at Google. I like Vince Vaughn when he is doing talented things, not so much with Owen Wilson. I guess this was touted highly because of the immense popularity of Wedding Crashers. While I don't think anyone will say this was funny as Wedding Crashers, it does manage to do what it sets out to and that's give you enough laughs to be a decent time passer. I wouldn't say I laughed out loud a lot, but I did smile and chuckle on quite a few occasions. This one is shockingly less lewd than most of its type. It also has heart and a good message, something you don't often see in a movie like this. As much as I'd like to continue praising this, I have to get to some constructive criticism. Like most, it's thoroughly predictable, not that it's a bad thing, just easy to guess where it's heading. My favorite moment is when they invent an app for drunken texts. The rule is that you have to pass a quiz before proceeding with a drunken text. I think that's ingenious. It potentially saves pain and headaches the next day or doing something you regret. Vince Vaughn does Vince Vaughn. He commands your attention and relies on his natural charisma. He can do this sort of thing in his sleep. Owen Wilson does Owen Wilson. I've never gotten the big deal about him, personally. Rose Byrne is OK, but a little underdeveloped in her role. John Goodman has a good cameo, but Will Ferrel's is stupid. Final Thoughts: I didn't mind it at all. It is a bit long in the tooth, but it has some good messages and refrains from being overly crude. You're not gonna miss anything if you decide to skip it, but I don't think you'll regret it either6/10",The Internship

The lead cast is back and although they have lost some of their charm, it wasn't a total disaster.The plot IS actually a disaster. But for the geeky essence of the plot, I rate it a humble 6.6 out of 10. The humor is good, the drama is fine and the writing is dumb. How only two groups are shown to be competing towards the end of the internship at Google is something like a cheap tactic. We don;t want no predictability. Also, most of stuffs here are made-up and unbelievable. To cut the long story short, it is a normal comedy movie with a rickety base. Do not expect heavy logic or premise, because that is just not the makers had in mind.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended for a one-time watch. IF... that is IF you have some free-time to watch.

34,The-Sarkologist,"It May be a Google Commercial, but it is still pretty good.",8,6 July 2013,"Okay, people might say that this is a Google commercial, or simply one whopping great piece of product placement (or even simply saying 'hey! Look how wonderful this place is to work so sucks to all of you that work in all the other places). Personally, I think a lot of companies could learn from what Google (and some other companies) have done because, seriously, a happy employee is a good employee, and to be honest, I have no interest in dealing with a company where the moral of the employees is so pathetically low that the product comes out as substandard because of this (particularly when the company is trying to say that they are customer-centric).As for the film, despite what people are saying about it, and despite it being a rehash of many films beforehand, it is still a good film. Basically it is about a couple of older guys who are out of work after the digital age makes the company that they are working for obsolete, so they manage to get themselves an internship at Google. They are then placed into teams and the team that wins a series of challenges wins a job at Google.As I've said, there are many films like this, and we always follow the underdog team that ends up coming out on top because they have something that the other teams simply do not have. Here it is actually the two older guys that are the motivators for the team, and who also think in a way that they other, younger, geeks, do not know how to think. In a way it is true, and they suggest this at the beginning of the film that these two guys might actually have something to offer because they don't think like the others.However, the one scene that I loved in this film was the obligatory 'lets take the geeks out for a night on the town and end up in a strip club' scene. As I have suggested, this scene is obligatory in such films, and it always astounds me how they always seem to do it just that little differently to still make it good, and very entertaining. Okay, I'm not a big fan of strip clubs (because they are simply ways of parting fools from their money), though I would still like to take a bunch of geeks to one (well, no, not really because, well, it is only a way for parting fools from their money). If there is one scene that I will remember it is when the guy who was brought up in a fundamentalist Christian household ends up dancing in the cage.",The Internship

Now these two have to compete with the energetic, smart, young generation seeking employment who are just coming from their college graduation. With the lack of computer knowledge Bill and Nick have to successfully complete the series of tasks to get the jobs.Kinda cool comedy from the director who gave us many fine comedy features. It was a good combo between Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, they were excelling in their respective roles. The lack of required knowledge in order to get the full employment at google make us to have fond on them. They really convinced us with their acting as innocence and middle aged strugglers. We can call it where the job hunting movie 'The Pursuit of Happiness' meets fun teen 'American Pie'.It was a good comedy as well serious about getting jobs for old guys. I know it was not real, It won't happen in real life but a heartwarming drama with some good laughs. After 'The Social Network' and 'jOBS' we expected a movie about google and now here it is. Although it was not based on real but a fictional dramedy which can be thoroughly enjoyable.7.5/10",The Internship
36,Rodrigo_Amaro,A platform movie with some laughs on the way,6,3 October 2013,"""The Internship"" is merely a platform movie. Period. A solid platform (yet useless if you stop to think about it) about Google and its amazing things, devices, products and jobs. Specially jobs, since it's about selling the dream job of producing apps and stuff and solving people's technological problems. But to get there there's an internship that chooses one team of young brains out there leaving thousands of others crying because the spots are limited. Here, two old timers in the sales business (Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson) try to make their way through this gigantic corporation and joining young geeks to get a position in the company.The problem with platform movies is the shameless use of a brand put in front of a movie instead of trying to focus on a quality story. Same goes for those movies made by Columbia in the late 1980's involving their owners at the time, Coca-Cola (see or better don't see ""Leonard - Part 6""). When the product pops here and there, it's OK, quite acceptable. But really insisting on the sell (of something which practically everybody uses nowadays) is annoying. It's like Google dominated the picture and all the cast and crew were in the background doing stuff. Sure, the brand is helpful but it's not all that great.As a comedy, this suffers a lot. It has its bits and pieces but consists mostly of chuckles, never giant laughs. And it relies on a lot of cultural references both for younger and older audiences, and sometimes the joke doesn't hold the effect needed with those. You won't believe the amount of people who simply don't get the X-Men reference used here during a ploy created by the kids to distract the adults. What upsets the most here is the sickening amount of stereotypical clichés ever given to all characters. It's all boiled down to nerds with no social kills but who own the world behind a machine; arrogant team leaders (like the little villain played by Max Minghella); the bossy Indian Google leader who frowns and frowns all the time, no charisma whatsoever as a leader; the girl hard to get; people and their fake and infuriating accents and on and on. If the movie conquers you it's because of some of the effective humored moments, the whole serious message that it's not easy for everybody out there on the line trying to make a living whether you're a young know-it-all about computers or whether you know how to sale a product and its underlined message of going after your dreams and never give up. Throw up if you can, but that always sells good in Hollywood and sometimes in life. But if you're expecting a buddy comedy with Wilson and Vaughn like ""Wedding Crashers"" well, get ready for the crash. Their chemistry is similar, even the characters construction are equal (Vince as the fast talker while Owen goes as the romantic lead) but the humor is diluted and better spread with their other cast mates. And this is a platform movie for other talent, stealing the show from these guys and probably main reason why the movie didn't disappoint at the box-office. It's a fine platform for most popular nerd of the moment, the adorable Dylan O'Brien, playing a member of the main team. Deadpan delivery and some good quotes made him a fun character to watch but of course it's a way for a studio to invest on a TV talent, a little unfamiliar to moviegoers. Well, it turned out better than Google's advertisement in here mostly because Dylan has loyal fans dedicated to him who would follow him like a pack of wolves. It's somewhat harmless. It bothers a little but it's a little fun as well. Good but troubled. 6/10",The Internship

38,eddie_baggins,"A sad attempt at comedy, an excuse to spend time with friends",2,23 October 2013,"The Internship is one informative movie! I learnt so much from this ""comedy"" in two hours it was almost like the life lesson I needed. Some of the things I learnt from this bizarre attempt at follow your dreams/losers to winners fable was – Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughan more than likely had the time of their rich lives making this movie (too bad they don't care if the audience does), if you ever need to bond with your workmates/teammates and learn life lessons just go and have a night out at the local exotic dance bar, you'll learn so much and my most important life lesson learnt of all – Google is googley good! The Internship is one of those movies that just makes you shake your head; a comedy that somehow forgot to put in the laughs. Vaughan and Wilson have showcased before just how good they can be when teamed together (Wedding Crashers a prime example of this and a comedy that provides regular laughs) but here the duo have stooped to a new career low and sold out to the lowest ebb possible – a movie disguised as a comedy that in no way whatsoever achieves anything of meaning on an entertainment level or underdog tale.Seemingly trying to be as annoying as possible the film flirts from one set piece to another normally featuring both Nick and Billy way out of their depth in a world of young up and comers and tech wizards. These up and comers and tech savvy know-it-all's are all mere caricatures and in no way reflect a realistic perspective of young people today, so it's hard to care much for any of these thinly drawn supporting players. It also must be noted that even Wilson and Vaughn don't really try to hard to earn the audiences support.The Internship is a sad, shallow movie that represents a lot that is wrong with major Hollywood movies and in particular big budget comedies in the mainstream today. It's an excuse to have a good time with buddies while disguising it as a ""movie"". The Internship is made all the worse by it being one big 2 hour long promotional video for how amazing Google is, and that's just offensive! I would say there are many punters out there that found this movie enjoyable and honestly I do feel sorry for them, I am all for being entertained with light fluffy entertainment but you could do a whole league better than this particular effort.1 unneeded Quidditch match out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",The Internship

The best thing about the film was that you get a slight insight into the world of Google, but that's about it. Vince Vaughn has verbal diarrhoea throughout the movie, which does get on my nerves, and Owen Wilson's whiny voice also becomes a bit tiresome. Apart from that, it's a feel good movie which has to be taken light heartily because the plot is a bit ridiculous. Throughout the whole 2 hours, I was hoping for something funny to happen, but nothing really does. Comedies like these always get the big budgets nowadays because they always make there money back, but that's not to say that they are actually good. Personally, I was disappointed but I'm sure that there are people out there that will disagree with me. Expected Better!Round-Up: The whole cast in this film just seemed a bit silly and pointless. None of them had that much substance, including the main characters who should have been much better. Owen Wilson is still whining his way through movies and Vince Vaughn can't help making a fool out of his big self. With such a big company like Google, I was surprised that they gave so much access into there world, but I'm sure that this won't hurt its reputation. If you just want a brainless laugh without a complicated storyline, then this is the movie for you.Budget: $58million Worldwide Gross: $94millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there comedies about a couple of guys who lose there jobs and try to get a job at Google. 4/10",The Internship

There was me expecting an unfunny, uncharismatic and unimaginative comedy and, for the first half, was just that. But then it hit me. This unknown warm sensation in my heart. Could it be that a Vince Vaughn comedy actually made me feel...something? A plot consisting of two middle aged men, who have recently become unemployed, venturing to the modern world by participating in an Internship for Google, had actually infiltrated my emotionless body? Yes, it's essentially an advertisement for Google, making them a reputable company that everyone wants to work for (mainly to sleep in those nap pods). And yes, the laughs are few and far between. But what really made this stand out from all the mediocre American ""comedies"" that are churned out annually, is the amount of heart within the story. Taking the stressful situation of losing a job and turning it into a narrative about optimism. Dream big and pursue your aspirations. It worked, and the likability of Wilson and Vaughn helped propel that warmth forward. This may just be the first comedy of both these actors that I actually liked. Now that, is a bold statement. The help of the supporting actors, particular Byrne and Minghella, assist in creating natural development within this team of interns (and a few love interests). The initial conflict stemmed from the age difference, but age is just a number. The life experience of the older interns complements the intellectual prowess of the younger individuals, thus forming a team. Unity. A theme that is overly explored in several disposable comedies, hence the underlying feeling of blandness. Also it does take some time for the narrative to get into its stride, over relying on stale pop cultural references. Still, this took me by surprise. And as a computer programmer, some of the jokes did produce a snigger from my cold dead soul. That in itself is an achievement.

Well, normal views, but depicted plainly (via winning nerds vs losing cool guys), using huge product placement (Google) and dull political correctness (characters of different races and backgrounds).

45,meeza,Worth the opportunity!,8,10 June 2013,"As I entered into ""The Internship"", I expected a popcorn entertainment summer comedy that was very comedic at times, but with a formulaic narrative plot; and that is what exactly I got from this internship. The film stars Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as Billy McMahon and Nick Campbell, two best buddies salesmen who abruptly get laid off from their marketing gigs due to a company shutdown. Nick goes the safe way by getting a job as a sales rep at his brother-in-law's mattress store. However, Billy feels like another dead-end job will lead him to an externship of financial limitations, so he gets all googled up and comes across an opportunity for him and his pal Nick by signing up into Google's internship program. Where did Billy find this opportunity? Where do you think? Anyways, Billy convinces Nick to get out of his mattress gig and join him at Googleland in San Francisco. Google's internship program is comprised of intern teams who must compete with one another in various competitions to demonstrate efficiency, teamwork, technological savvy, customer service, application development, and more. Whichever team wins, gets fulltime jobs at Google. Sign me up!!! Billy and Nick, being in their mid-40's, are in the minority age-wised in the program because all of the other interns are straight-out-of- college youngsters in their early 20's. Billy and Nick team up with three other youngsters; the smartphone obsessive Stuart, the chirpy Neha, the mama's boy Yo-Yo Santos, and the Google young employee Lyle which facilitates the team and admires the vivacious street-smart demeanors of Billy & Nick. There is also a prototype villain in the storyline which would be the self-centered Graham Hawtrey, a college grad who is always logged on in developing mischievous ways to humiliate and beat out the competition, most notably Billy and Nick. Rose Byrne also comes into the picture portraying Dana, a workaholic Google executive who Nick wants to match.com I mean match up with romantically. Shawn Levy directed ""The Internship"" more in line with the work of an intern; should not be expecting magnificent results but very worthy of its effort. There were numerous laugh-out-load moments in the movie, so credit goes to Vaughn and Jared Stern's screenplay for those ""good job"" pluses of ""The Internship""; but when it came to the ""innovative plot development"" task, I must say that Scribe Team Vaughnstern were not in line for a promotion. Nevertheless, kudos to Jared and Vince for the comedic portion of the screenplay. Yes, they will get jobs in Hollywood, as if they haven't already, especially V.V. Speaking of Mr. Vaughn, his Vaughnisms definitely fit the role as Billy, so Vince is credited with another positive comedic performance. However, Mr. Wilson's lazy performance as Nick did not have enough gusto, even though his scenes with Billy were beyond satisfactory due to the chemistry that these two crashers continue to have in pictures together. I did ""like"" the supporting work from Aasif Mandvi as Mr. Chetty, the head of the internship program at Google. I liked it so much that I decided to google Mandvi to see what other movies he has been in; even though the faster route would be to IMDb it. The young actors in the picture held their ground, but I would not recommend any upward mobility in the acting world for any of them; for now that is. Max Minghella's performance as the villainous Graham Hawtrey was a carbon copy as the one he portrayed in ""The Social Network""; kind of like comparing ""Instagram"" to other sharing-photos social sites. Rose Byrne is a respectable young actress, but I must say that every Rose has its thorn, and for Ms. Byrne it would be her lackluster performance as Dana; even though it was easy on the eyes. ""The Internship"" should not be minimized by the movie-going public, but then again there is no reason to maximize it as the best comedy of the year. Logging off!

For a movie full of movie and cultural references one would think that these two characters in their 40's would know something about computers, Harry Potter and X-Men. It's not like these guys are in their 80's, they grew up around computers and should at least know that you don't say ""on the line."" I get it that this is a comedy and they used some of these situations to create funny moments, but at least they could've been a little less lazy and done something original. I really love Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn together, I think they play off each other really well. Wedding Crashers is one of my all time favorite comedies and I was really looking forward to seeing these guys work together again. But I wasn't expecting them to repeat basically the same formula they used before. It just felt way too similar without being nearly as funny, but I still have to admit that I enjoyed this at some level simply because I am a fan of these two comedians. The script was real lazy and dull, while the secondary characters weren't funny at all. Not even Will Ferrell's cameo worked here like it has done in so many other movies. The love story between Owen Wilson's character and Rose Byrne's was also one of the weakest I've seen in a comedy. And the villain played by Max Minghella was completely one dimensional. The Internship fails at every level as a comedy and only fans of Wilson and Vaughn will have an enjoyable time here. They made this film bearable for me despite the clichés and predictable cheesy ending. I would recommend you to watch Wedding Crashers for the hundredth time before seeing this film.Billy (Vince Vaughn) and Nick (Owen Wilson) have worked together as salesmen for most of their lives and they are pretty great at what they do, the only problem is that with the digital era at its peak their services are becoming obsolete. Their boss (John Goodman) decides to retire and move to Miami, so Billy and Nick find themselves unemployed in their mid 40's with no idea of what to do next. Billy comes up with the bright idea of trying to get a job at Google, but before they can do that they have to begin as interns and fight for a job opportunity along with hundreds of younger and talented college nerds. The manager in charge of the intern program, Mr. Chetty (Aasif Mandvi), decides to divide the interns into groups and have them compete against each other in several challenges. The winning group will be hired. Billy and Nick are teamed up with the outcasts Lyle (Josh Brener), Stuart (Dylan O'Brien), Neha (Tiya Sircar), and Yo-Yo Santos (Tobit Raphael) and against all odds they will have to compete against other tech-savvy geniuses: their biggest rivals being Graham's (Max Minghella) group.I was surprised to see how formulaic this comedy was. It played out kind of in the same way that Monsters University did. It's as if this were the live versions of those animated characters. Shawn Levy has always had a sort of similar approach as a director in all his movies (Date Night, Night at the Museum, and Real Steel). The script was written by Vince Vaughn himself and you can tell how he took similar elements from some of his previous comedies. The entire film feels at times like a commercial for Google, and there are really a few laughs for a two hour comedy. There is some trouble with the overall pacing of the film which makes the story drag at times. The only good thing about The Internship is getting to see Vaughn and Wilson back together again being charming and interplaying with one another.",The Internship

48,cekadah,A 2 hour Google infomercial covered in honey to ...,3,13 October 2013,"draw flies and ants!For the life of me I cannot figure out the reasoning for this plot line. Who in the digital world today has traveling salesmen for watches?? That part of the story threw me, and is only there to stress the point everyone uses their cell phone for knowing what time it might be and not watches. Not so true!!!The short of this movie is two middle age men are suddenly fish out of water and they must learn to survive. Technology has passed them by and they find themselves in the mix of Google youth culture seeking jobs.The kids have the technical minds, the old guys have the 'life experience' and their ""team"" learns life in the digital world is no different from the analog world. There are leaders and followers and leaders need to be followers also.This is NOT 2 hours of story and the sappiness gets too sticky, cute, and stinky. You know the end way before it happens .... ho hum!",The Internship
49,juneebuggy,Wears thin fast relying exclusively on the bromance between Vaughn and Wilson,3,15 October 2015,"This was a very dumb movie, almost unbearable at times relying exclusively on the interaction and chemistry between Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson (Wedding Crashers) to keep things going.The script is cliché-riddled, formulaic and basically just a long advertisement for Google. Yes I got a couple of laughs, Will Farrell's cameo as the bed salesman with the emo neck tattoo comes to mind but they were not worth the pain of sitting through 2 hours of idiotic dialogue and unoriginal scenes for.I will say that initially the story idea felt unique, following two recently unemployed salesman who land internships at Google and are forced to compete against overachieving college students for jobs at the tech giant. But the execution, with these two oldsters teaching the cool kids that there's more to life than computers i.e. getting drunk in strip bars wears thin.It also managed to feel very dated and very safe where the gags were concerned. And what was up with Vaughn and Wilson sharing a bed? Come on they're grown men. It was as if the writer (Vaughn) forgot that the characters were meant to be veteran salesmen (adults) and not still wedding crashers 9/30/15",The Internship
50,dwpollar,Feel good movie about a couple of salesmen...,7,10 April 2014,"1st watched 4/5/2014 – 7 out of 10(Dir-Shawn Levy): Feel good movie about a couple of salesmen who's company goes under and they decide to interview for interships with Google. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are likable and funny and play off each other well which makes the movie work. Yes – it is a cliché Rocky-type movie for geeks and starts to lose it's adrenaline when we're taken to a strip club for an un-necessary 15 minutes during their teams downtime, but overall the feel good quality comes thru. The idea that this duo is behind the times is emphasized in the first few scenes when they are trying to sell watches to the current generation who we know use their cell phones to get this information. They are definitely excellent salesmen who study their customers to the point of knowing their children and their actual lives before presenting them with the sale. When they lose their jobs, they first take small positions, but Vaughn's character gets a brainstorm while staring at a Google search screen and finds out they are interviewing for internships. Their online interview is a disaster but they are somehow given a chance and are incorporated on their first day with a ragtag team of misfits. The team has to compete and win challenges similar to a reality TV-show(which seems kind of un-realistic) but is entertaining. It kind of makes the movie similar to the first Harry Potter film with an actual Quidditch-type challenge included in the mix. There is a little romance as the Wilson character tries to win over a meeting-ladened executive but this really adds little to the story. Billy, played by Vaughn, is really the meat of the story as he is reminded of his past failures after forgetting to login to a customer service challenge and then temporarily goes back to a sales gig. This is just fodder for Wilson's character to bring him back to the fold for a Rocky-like finale. The movie is not perfect and the story has been done many times but never in this setting. It is a win-win movie for Vince Vaughn using his multiple talents by writing the story and co-writing the screenplay, starring and co-producing the film. Despite it's faults the movie is worthwhile and an enjoyable movie to watch.",The Internship
51,3xHCCH,"Didn't We Just See This as ""Monsters University""?",5,13 August 2013,"""The Internship"" is a story about two 40-something watch salesmen, Billy McMahon and Nick Campbell, who lose their jobs because their boss suddenly decides to shut down their dwindling business. Out of desperation, they try out and (inexplicably) get accepted into the coveted internship program at Google. As the outcasts among the much youthful majority, the two guys struggle with their group of other misfits to snag those elusive job slots over all the other candidates.The story of misfits trying to fit into an establishment and succeed is so familiar. This story was just recently tackled in animated form in Pixar's ""Monsters University."" This movie follows that tried and true formula to the letter, from being put down hard at the start to winning big at the end against all odds.Here though, the setting just shifted from a university campus to the Google Headquarters in California, and that was THE one interesting aspect of this film. If those were the real perks of actual Google staff (unlimited free food, nap pods, etc.), then we would all like to work there! Many people criticize this film for being a big 2-hour advertisement for the Google Corporation. However, without this innovative setting, the rest of the film would just not stand up.A lot is riding on the comedic talents and good will of the two main stars Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson (who had previously paired up in the very successful ""Wedding Crashers""). They are credible as good guys, yes, and they have good chemistry together as Billy and Nick. However, sadly for me, they could not rise above the mediocre material they had to contend with. Their jabbering sales pitches frequently come across as annoying rather than charming. I would not buy anything from salesmen like them.An interesting detail for the Filipino audience is the presence of a Fil-Am character named Yo-Yo Santos, played by Fil-Am actor Tobit Raphael. A sheltered kid home-schooled by a domineering mom, Yo-Yo is one of misfits who was forced to team up with Billy and Nick. Tobit did well enough for his first big role in a major movie although his part is memorable only for nervously picking his eyebrows and an ""impressive recovery time"" during their wild night at a bar with sexy ladies.Overall, you get an uneven film. Only the setting is original, but mostly, this is just an average feel-good comedy, with some raunchy scenes. You will smile more than laugh out loud. Nevertheless, you will still have a happy feeling with the final outcome, however predictable it is. 5/10.",The Internship
52,peterp-450-298716,Plain simply not funny ....,1,3 March 2014,"""Can we talk about the on the line thing for a minute?"" Vince & Owen, the witty American duo. They performed together in ""The Wedding Crashers"". Same routine, the same way of complementary conversations. Now they don't infiltrate at a wedding where they pretend to be family-related, but they infiltrate a high-tech company, Google, where they pretend to fit perfectly into the club of whiz kids who hang out there. Who says this is not a very devious way to put your business into the picture for the commercial part of our society, may join the large group of people who got fooled by the mega-company Google.As a comedy I thought it was terribly disappointing. How is it that this movie gets a 6.4 on IMDb ? Very simple , it's pure American humor. And sorry, I don't exactly like that kind of humor all the time. It is a sequence of (would-be) tricky witticisms and puns. The volumes of conversations were so colossal that the subtitles sometimes could not follow so I needed to rewind several times because I had missed almost a full chapter of the two jokers their flood of words. And I wasn't laughing out loud a lot during the entire movie either. Not even a micro minute of the film. Bewildered, I read comments such as : ""The movie was great from beginning to end. I laughed harder than I have in any recent comedy I've seen in the theater."". I fear that this person hasn't seen a lot of comedies in his life.Now about the predictable events and clichés. This was a succession of predictable clichés. I admit that not all comedies can have an original design and get a new record in the category ""comedy"". But this was really annoyingly bad and deeply sad. From miles away you could already see it coming how it would end. The mentor who strongly dislikes the two newcomers from the beginning and uses every opportunity to make fun of them and obviously finally turned out to be the one who believed in them, because he had to start from scratch also once and also saw that spark in them. Owen meets Dana by chance, and you know immediately that this will result into something passionately. The fact that they get stuck stuck with a bunch of nerds, they will teach moral values​ so they start believing in themselves and making the victory a reality, was also obvious. Then there is the arrogant brilliant opponent who makes you look like a fool all the time but in the is the poor sucker again. After that one of them gives up because he starts realizing that maybe afterall it was a big mistake to show up there, and then triumphantly returns to retrieve the loot. Sigh ... Terrible ....The most irritating character in the whole movie was Lyle. A terrible ADHD type of guy who probably made the most effort of all to look like a comedian and be as funny as hell. Would I be there personally, I would have certainly thrown my iPad to his head after 5 minutes.It's indeed a modern and newer version of ""Revenge of the Nerds"", but oh so bad ...",The Internship
53,dierregi,Overlong and exceedingly verbose,1,25 March 2017,"In this sad excuse for a movie Wilson and Vaughn are two unemployed salesmen who manage to get an internship at Google. The comedic element should be that two 40 something who know nothing about technology can compete with kids born with a smartphone in their hands, thanks to their life experience .Unfortunately, the paper thin plot is further watered down by the endless speeches (mostly monologues) delivered by Wilson and Vaughn. They talk so much, half way through the movie I just wanted them to shut up and give some space to the other characters - as stereotyped as they are.Vaughn wrote the script and as it often happens in these cases, he decided to give himself and Wilson lots of long, boring, pseudo-deep speeches. I never notice how annoying an actor he can be when given so much space. Unrestrainable talkative, arrogant and loud.A chemistry-free love story is added to the plot, with some cringe-inducing scenes such as the Rose Byrne character asking Wilson during their first date to behave obnoxiously and he obliging.The movie does not work even as a two-hour long ad for Google. In fact, it seems to last way longer. I could not believe how long it dragged on. Luckily I watched it on TV and I let it play until the end, only because somebody mentioned that the end credits are the best part of the movie - considering how bad is the movie, it is still not much...",The Internship
54,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Internship,7,28 May 2014,"Slated as an early June release, The Internship tells the story of two guys (wrist watch salesmen I'm thinking) who lose their jobs to the unfortunate medium of technology and decide to travel to California. Their objective: Get jobs at Google and start a new life. The two best friends (Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as Billy and Nick respectively) are much older than all the interns at the Google factory and feel out of place at first. But they inject a sort of teamwork aspect that their ""Big Brother"" team somewhat lacks. This sets off a chain of events and brings everybody closer to their goal of getting full time gigs at what Billy states is ""the best job in America.""So after viewing The Watch (unnecessarily rated R junk) and The Dilemma (a dark and restless vehicle trying to pass off as comedy), I was a little skeptical about taking in the latest quote unquote ""Vince Vaughn movie."" I've been critical of this guy in the past because he relentlessly gives the same performance over and over (it started with Old School and he hasn't looked back since). As a result, I'd be lying if I said I had high expectations venturing into the theater to see The Internship. But wouldn't you know it, this film surprised me. It is a refreshing, lightweight comedy that piles on good, solid palatable laughs. Its got a lot of characters in it that win you over. And its got Owen Wilson on board to compliment his best bud Vaughn. Because of this, Vaughn automatically becomes a much more likable actor this time around. The two of them echo back to their Wedding Crashers days by basically playing the same characters (it's like their always on a mission), having sort of similar adventures (Owen gets to be smooth with the ladies again), and making all of us laugh wholeheartedly.But let's be honest, The Internship is no masterpiece. Much of what happens in it does not permeate to real life (there's maybe a 10% chance these guys would be hired at this particular organization full of genius code breakers). This flick feels more like a fantasy than a dose of surmised reality (the term ""it's only a movie"" applies here like you wouldn't believe). Overall though, this motion picture just wants to have fun. It tells a good story (not a true one mind you), has an outrageous Will Ferrell cameo, and caters to the whole Vaughn/Wilson chemistry thing. And although The Internship strives to be great but comes up a little short, that's okay because it defines the word ""harmless."" It also has a breeziness to it that's contagious. With the exception of a little too much improvisation from the cast (they talk real fast like they're in old 50's movies), what's on screen still gets my recommendation. Reason being is that it sets a gold standard for a PG-13 laugh fast. It does this by teetering on the brink of R rated movie fare while thankfully not going over the edge. It's a welcome surprise when you can giggle and snarl in the theater without the abundance of cuss words.With the summer movie season concluding over three months ago, The Internship doesn't quite fit the mold of a huge bloated blockbuster like we see every year (yes I'm talking about Transformers). But for what it's worth, I enjoyed myself for two straight hours. It's not easy to make a film where everything comes together perfectly (you know script, direction, editing, music, etc...). So to sum up my review, I'd say yes, this film has many flaws. But for laughable escapist entertainment, it undoubtedly does the trick.",The Internship
55,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Has a good story but takes its time developing,6,9 May 2014,"Most of the youth that are either in college or getting out of college are looking for jobs. It's no longer a period in time the jobs are waiting for people to just take them. Students and other people of different ages a like must now fight and prove their worth to the employer. The only people who make it big nowadays are the ones who have the right connections. If someone knows the right person, they could make it into a place that's hard to find for a lot of other job searchers. So what's the best way to try and secure a job in this day and age? The most common choice would be getting an internship. This is exactly what Billy (Vince Vaughn) and Nick (Owen Wilson) reach out to do.After discovering that the company they work for has gone bankrupt, salesmen Billy and Nick decide that it's time for them to take a chance step out of their comfort circle and take part in an internship sponsored by Google. Once they get there, they realize that it's going to take more than just sales experience to get through the challenges that lie ahead. The catch is, they can't do it alone - a group is needed. There they join and form a cluster sore thumbs to help complete the required tasks. The best part is, the more time they work together the more they develop as characters, no matter how cliché they may be. But what separates Billy and Nick from the rest is that they are 20 years older than everyone else is, which severely dates them.The rest of the characters involved in the group are not a breath of fresh air either but become likable over time nonetheless. The group is headed by a Google lead named Lyle (Josh Brener) who tries to help break the ice among the other socially awkward group members by talking in third person and trying to act like he has swag. The audience will also meet Stuart (Dylan O'Brien), a guy with an intense ego and loves checking his phone every 5 minutes. Then there's Yo-Yo (Tobit Raphael), a smart kid who takes challenges too seriously. Finally there's Neha (Tiya Sircar), also a smart girl with several other interests that most girls probably wouldn't project so openly to other people. All around, they make an intriguing hodgepodge of a team. The majority of these actors don't t have much under their belt but do a decent job portraying their characters.Thankfully, Vince Vaughn and Jared Stern's writing gave even enough character development to each character that is introduced to the audience. There's even a bit of a love interest with Nick and a woman named Dana (Rose Byrne), although the background to this female isn't expanded upon much. However, this is an aspect that Vaughn and Stern got right - likability of the characters. They really are likable characters, the problem is that over the running time of two hours, it'll take a while to actually feel much for them. The flaw in this lies in the comedy; it's just not that funny. Without comedy it's harder to portray charm. Rarely did I laugh or even chuckle to a lot of the slapstick. I know I wasn't expecting an all out riot but I also didn't expect to not laugh much either. Again, it's not until the viewer is far into the running time will there actually be points where it could bring out some laughs.Perhaps the one character that is the most fun to watch and listen to is Mr. Chetty (Aasif Mandvi), the man in charge of the internship program. Not only does he exchange some comical remarks with Vince Vaughn's role but also just the way he presents himself. It's surprising though because writer Jared Stern has written for well acclaimed films like The Princess and the Frog (2009) and Wreck-It Ralph (2012) so it's puzzling to why the comical aspects of the film weren't very effective, unless, that was all credit to Mr. Vaughn's part. If there's one thing though to excite viewers is the cinematography and production design of the Google campus. It sure looks like fun. Lastly, Christophe Beck produced the score to the film and although it takes a back seat to more soundtrack music, it still is fairly effective when it's used. That's pretty much it.The film is watchable with appropriate character development and cool looking production design of the Google campus. However, expecting it to be funny may be asking too much. Very few interactions produce a laugh.",The Internship
56,Sandcooler,"Nothing new, but it works",7,8 July 2013,"Let's see if this seems familiar: hapless good guys end up in a new world they know nothing about, get teased by some bad guys and have to beat everyone in some kind of contest that goes on throughout the entire movie. At first they suck at everything, but eventually they somehow manage to blend in and pull through. Oh, and there's an unreachable love interest that eventually loosens up. ""The Internship"" is basically a copy-paste of pretty much every mainstream comedy script ever, but hell, at least I laughed a lot. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson still have amazing chemistry with one another, the dialogues are chock full of funny non-sequiturs and even the side characters aren't completely redundant for once, there's not much more you can expect from this. I don't think anybody will be really overwhelmed when the end credits roll, but I don't think you can totally hate this either. It's more than good enough for a fun evening, just don't expect it to change your life or anything like that.",The Internship
57,pc95,Kinda Fun and Googly,6,15 September 2013,"Caught this ""stroll"" of a movie, ""The Internship"", recently on a plane ride and was fairly pleased with the watch. While it doesn't really bring anything original, it features Vaughn and Wilson back since their earlier pairing in ""Wedding Crashers"" in a bit of a fun setting at the Google campus that the filmmakers don't hesitate to poke mild fun at. Best performance in the movie easily goes to Aasif Mandvi whose paternal instincts and teacher-like patience helps to ground a lot of the expected childishness from the mains. Rose Byrne collects a paycheck without even having to strip her native Australian accent. The youngin's on screen do a fair job, but the laughs are fairly muted and sterile.

58,bob-rutzel-1,Saves itself at the end,5,31 October 2013,"Watch salesmen Billy (Vince Vaughn) and Nick (Owen Wilson) lost their jobs because the company went out of business. They decide to become interns at Google and both are computer illiterates. Let the games begin.This was the most annoying first half of any movie I have seen this year. What to do? What to do? Shut it down? Continue? Oh, the decisions I must make! Why me? I continued and found the second half, actually the second half of the second half of the movie that became pretty good. The movie saved itself, but I had to go almost to the very end to find it enjoyable. Why did it take so long? One reason is that an actor (Vaughn) who also stars in the movie should not be allowed to be one of the writers of the movie. See?It also took so long because in the first half Vince Vaughn had to go thru his shtick of talking at light speed when no one can understand a thing he is saying. But, he didn't do it too often, just often enough to be annoying. Good thing Owen Wilson was in here as he was the needed buffer as he and Vaughn do have pretty good chemistry. Then the movie settled into a normal movie where nothing exciting happens until the end. They get accepted at Google for a reason you will discover at the very end. They are teamed with smart kids with skills: Neha (Tiya Sircar), Yo Yo (Tobit Raphael), Stuart (Dylan O'Brien), and Lyle (Josh Brener). They are smart but each has a character trait that holds them back. The teams must win certain contests to be allowed to actually be hired by Google. Billy and Nick teach the kids teamwork and it seems to work. And, for Billy, he learns not to give up on things. There is a raunchy celebration at one point for the team at a nightclub with pole-dancing girls. This was totally unnecessary and why it was included is still a mystery. Yes, there is lap dancing ,too, but we don't see any of that. No nudity but we do see the results of male ejaculation by one of the team drying his underwear using the bathroom dryer. Mr. Chetty played by Aasif Mandvi was outstanding as the director of the interns. His performances at key times kept me from shutting this down in the first half. His deliveries were spot on. Will Ferrell, John Goodman and Rob Riggle had small cameos. All in all this movie saves itself because of the ending. There are some funny and clever one-liners but nothing memorable to report. (5/10)Violence: Not really. A fight, sort of, breaks out at the nightclub. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Bathroom dryer: Used to dry underwear. See above. Language: One F-bomb by Nick. Many S-words throughout.",The Internship
59,moviexclusive,"Coasting on Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson's effortless chemistry, this extended Google ad is still extremely affable, good-natured fun",6,14 August 2013,"Why it has taken close to a decade to reunite Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson after their comedy smash 'Wedding Crashers' is beyond us; but 'The Internship' shows that neither Vaughn nor Wilson has lost any chemistry after all those years. As two ace but out-of-work middle-aged salesmen who video-conference their way to a coveted summer internship at Google, the two A-list comedians are the very reasons why the loosely-scripted and perhaps entirely formulaic underdog tale still proves enjoyable.As with 'Crashers', this Shawn Levy-directed film coasts along by the sheer easy interplay between the actors – Vaughn with his glib-but desperate patter and Wilson with his earnest sweetness. Indeed, Vaughn's screenplay – which he co-wrote with Jared Stern based upon his own story - specifically plays in both dialogue and character to the natural rapport and personality of the two stars, so much so that even their banter over some triviality – like the merits of including Alanis Morissette's 'Ironic' on their 'Get Psyched' mix – is so effortlessly engaging.Thanks to their camaraderie, what is otherwise a two-hour commercial for GoogleWorld comes off much less ingratiating. To be fair, 'the world's number one company' can't quite be held responsible for this longest example of product placement; it was Vaughn after all who pitched this movie to the company, which then saw no reason not to reject his offer of free publicity. Nonetheless, the 'Google is great' subtext is too blatant to be ignored –whether in terms of endless free food or access to 'nap-pods' - and your tolerance for 'Googliness' will still affect how much you enjoy this buddy comedy.Acknowledging the digital divide that exists between the tech-savvy and the tech-goondos in today's world, Vaughn and Wilson start off as mid- 40-somethings that are hopelessly old-school analog idiots. As such narrative trajectories demand, they are ostracised among the other interns who are mostly half their age. But teamed with a bunch of misfit geek kids in a Hunger Games-like competition where the winners gets the chance at full-time jobs, the seemingly clueless Nick (Wilson) and Billy (Vaughn) get their chance to demonstrate that it isn't all about tech-speak and tech-knowhow; rather, some old-fashioned teamwork and salesmanship might just make all the difference.These are interesting observations about the new corporate America, but earnest as the film may be about imparting such wisdom, its approach is as corny as can be, complete with a cringe-inducing climax that sees the band of outcasts triumph the arrogant smarty-pants led by an appropriately cocky Max Minghella. Instead, the film truly comes alive when it simply lets Vaughn and Wilson do what they do best – and that is, play street smart and party-hearty. Easily the film's funniest sequence has Nick and Billy showing their troupe how to have a wild night out at a strip club, unleashing the inner animal in a clammy high- IQ Asian boy Yo-Yo (Tobit Raphael) with low social skills, a glum cynic Stuart (Dylan O'Brien) whose head is constantly buried in his smartphone, a sexually curious South Asian Neha (Tiya Sircar) and even their socially awkward 23-year-old Google team leader Lyle (Josh Brener).Outside the club though, Vaughn and Wilson get recurrent amusing gags haggling the intimidating head of their intern programme Mr Chetty (Aasif Mandvi) and a Google staffer Dana (Rose Bryne) respectively. They also gently riff on 'X-Men' and 'Flashdance', though the use of the latter does wear out its welcome especially to those who have no inkling of that 80s cultural benchmark. Still, the better moments belong to the ones where Vaughn and Wilson are simply allowed to hang loose and be funny, a last-ditch effort to inject some dramatic tension with Vaughn's departure from the team prior to their crucial last task resolved in a deus-ex-machina that rings hollow.Like we said earlier, this is a film that runs entirely on the exceedingly affable, good-natured charm of its two leads. To his credit, Levy does a fair job keeping the film light-hearted yet pacey, while giving Vaughn and Wilson the space to exercise their considerable improvisational comedy gifts. Put aside the Google-oogling, and what you have is an opportunity to simply chill with two funny old pals, who Crash-ed their way out of a Wedding eight years earlier and are back for a reunion that feels every bit as delightful.",The Internship
60,tomsview,Embracing Googliness,7,18 October 2013,"Whether or not you like this movie pretty much comes down to how you feel about the two stars. I love them, and was looking forward to this movie. OK, it's not as good as ""Wedding Crashers,"" but it's a lot better than some of the negative criticism would indicate.Is it predictable? Sure. But we all knew it would be. However, far from being irrelevant or past their use-by-date as some critics have suggested, Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson are in great form in this film.Vince Vaughn as Billy McMahon and Owen Wilson as Nick Campbell wangle their way into an internship at Google after losing their jobs as watch salesmen – mobile phones have killed off the wristwatch.At Google, Billy and Nick find themselves on a team made up of a group of 21-year-olds that even their fellow geeks have rejected. Together the six outsiders work though a series of projects that will decide who gets jobs at Google. Despite the demographic abyss, the young people bring computer skills to the table, while Billy and Nick possess life skills and a fair amount of unconventional charm.Eventually the team bonds through a series of adventures and misadventures. Finally, it's Billy and Nick's old-fashioned skills as salesmen that saves the day and puts their team on top. Along the way, there is some love interest for Nick in the form of Rose Byrne as Dana, a Google executive.Rose Byrne, an Australian, actually plays an Aussie in the film. Weirdly, I found her accent harder to understand than Owen Wilson's, and I am an Aussie with an Aussie accent. The truth is that I see so many American movies that my ears have become attuned to American accents in American movies – throw an Aussie one in there and I get confused. I found Rose easier to understand when she played a Trojan princess alongside Brad Pitt in ""Troy"".A lot of critics feel ""The Internship"" is too much of a corporate video for Google disguised as a comedy. I don't buy that. As someone who has very little idea how Google runs, I found the inside look fascinating.The film is actually weakest when it goes outside Google; the nightclub sequence is pretty contrived and a bit tacky – therapy through lap dancing? Nonetheless, something along those lines was needed for the team of misfits to bond. As for Quidditch; I found the game the most boring element in the Harry Potter movies, let alone playing it at ground level without any flying. But I guess touch football just wouldn't have possessed the requisite Googliness for the story. However, I don't think the movie is fatally flawed by these weaker sequences. The movie starts well, slumps a bit in the middle, but lifts again before the end.There are also plenty of funny scenes in ""The Internship"" – Nick working in his brother-in-law's mattress store; the interview in the public library with little kids hovering to use the computer; the clash of cultures between Billy and Nick and the young team when they reach Google. Funny and engaging, it is this last interaction that gives the movie it's unique quality. As long as you don't expect another ""Wedding Crashers"", there is much to like in ""The Internship"".",The Internship
61,intelearts,502nd Review: So-so Comedy That Is Nearly Mildly Enjoyable - Excepting...,4,3 October 2013,"Googleship is a mild comedy about modern work that has occasional moments of real fun and comedy amongst its over-riding idea that Google is not a behemoth - it's all a little too much fun and no work to offer anything other than a very lightweight comedy.The two leads are again, as Wedding Crashers, pretty charming with a world-weary edge. We sort of enjoyed it - though at 2 hrs it is too long for a comedy - it is fairly by the book but as said mildly enjoyable. However, there is a middle section in a nightclub that will make some viewers uncomfortable - a lot of sexist and sexism suddenly appears - and it really lowers the whole tone of the film - while we understood that it has some place in character development we were surprised and disappointed to see a film which otherwise has good female role models yet again reduce women to the status of madonnas or whores. I'm not being prudish or puritan here - what could be a good comedy about the workplace to show even in schools with some good positive messages yet again leaves 50% of the population feeling why bother.The supporting cast and filming are all pretty much what you'd expect and overall there are worse ways to spend a couple of hours - just fast forward the club scene.",The Internship
62,Screen_Blitz,Pointless comedy with very few laughs,4,19 May 2015,"Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn from Wedding Crashers (2005) take on Silicon Valley in this Shawn Levy comedy. Wilson and Vaughn play two salesman who face company downsizes, and in attempt to resurface their employment, take an internship with a band of misfit tech-geeks at the Google headquarters. This film follows them on their struggles to earn their position for employment at the high-tech company. This comedy had lots of potential, but failed to come up with hardly any good laughs, the result was a film that was more of a two-hour Google commercial than a comedy.With Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn in the lead roles, I had good expectations for this film; but it only ended up disappointing me. Vaughn and Wilson only made me laugh maybe 3 or 4 times. Other than that, I was getting rather bored. There is one scene takes place at a night club, a type of scene that you would expect laugh during, but nothing laugh-worthy is ever said or occurs. Only the good thing this film has to offer is some cheesy sex-related dialogue that is hard to laugh at. For a film about characters taking an internship at Google, this would have been better as drama or a documentary because audience can learn many things about what it's like to work for Google which would make an interesting experience. As a comedy, it just doesn't work, it only ends up being a two-hour commercial for Google.Unless you're a huge fan Owen Wilson and/or Vince Vaughn, this movie would be better worth skipping.",The Internship
63,baumer,One of the under rated films of the last decade,9,2 April 2021,"I think when this film came out everybody was expecting and hoping for another Wedding Crashers. This film wasn't well reviewed by critics and it wasn't well received by an audience. It opened softly and finished softly. People seemed to be angry over the fact that it was about working at a real company, Google. Others seem to lament the fact that it wasn't a laugh out loud comedy like Wedding Crashers.But I think as the years have gone by and people have had a chance to revisit this film perhaps more people see it the way I saw it when it first came out. To me there were sporadic moments of hilarity but more importantly it was a film that I think transcends generations. For people in their 40s like me who aren't technology wizards, I could relate to both Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. And for the younger generation that might know everything about Chrome and Gmail and Excel and so on the film also spoke to them about the trials and tribulations and difficulties of finding your way in the world. Vince Vaughn was one of the writers and I think he perfectly captures a snapshot into the hopes and fears of both generations and at the same time understands that hard work still does pay off.Maybe a lot of people won't find this film hilarious but I'm not one of those people. I actually enjoyed this film for the dichotomy that is presented to us. I loved the pop culture references that the young kids seem to come up with every different scene and I loved that Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn's characters were relied upon for life experience and for their sales experience.I also absolutely loved the cast. Of course you have Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson but then you add in Rose Byrne, basically a cameo appearance by a mostly silent Josh Gad and then a bunch of young and upcoming actors led by Dylan O'Brien , Tiya Sircar and Tobit Raphael. But perhaps my favorite character in the movie was Mr Chetty who was played by Asif Mandvi. There was a lot of honesty in the examination of these characters but there was also a lot of hilarity.I think my favorite scene in the film is when Nick played by Owen Wilson and Dana played by Rose Byrne finally go on a date and she tells him that she needs him to be a typical bad date that she's experienced over the last 10 years. And then in mocking fashion he completely belittles her and makes fun of her while at dinner telling her that she's not allowed to eat what she's eating because she's getting fat and that she has to pay the bill and so on and so on. It was such an honest way of flirting with one another and it was beautifully written and beautifully acted by both Rose and Owen.The Internship is one of my favorite movies of the last decade. There's not a lot of grandiose moments but there's more quiet introspective observations and a lot of '80s references and a myriad of other pop culture mentions. From Flashdance to Harry Potter to the X-Men and so much more in between this film really covers the gauntlet of Pop culture.I would highly recommend this movie to anybody who avoided it because they thought it was an advertisement for Google or because they heard it was nothing like Wedding Crashers. Both of those might be true but that doesn't take away from my enjoyment of the film and I don't think it would from yours either.9/10.",The Internship

65,brchthethird,A feature-length ad for Google,4,14 November 2014,"I'll call this movie out for what it is: a feature-length advertisement for Google. Beyond that it's a retread of DODGEBALL, and not half as funny either. Most of the time I wanted to cringe at how bad this movie was. There was nothing new or fresh about any of it. The only good thing about it was the comic banter between Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughan, who plays the character he plays in every movie. Sure, the underdog story is easy to get behind, but at times it was cloyingly sentimental and it stuck to close to the beats audiences have come to expect from these types of movies. Since I watched the extended/unrated version, yes there were some f-bombs and extended party sequence complete with nudity, but it messed up the pacing of the movie, which was already 15-20 minutes too long anyway. Not only that, but it felt tacked on and out of place. The only other good things were some brief cameos by better comic actors (John Goodman, Will Ferrell and Rob Riggle. There's even a mid-credits ""lost cosplay"" scene which is funnier than most of the previous material. Even the credits were more creative than the script. Overall this was a dud and people in the mood for this type of comedy would be better served by revisiting DODGEBALL or WEDDING CRASHERS.",The Internship

The grumpy 'Dean' is there but is now a grumpy middle manager. But has no real power over the heroes as they can always just go and get another job.I loved Vince and Owen in 'Wedding Crashers' here it feels the characters have just been copy and pasted into a different setting. It doesn't really work.The heroes dispense wisdom to the hard working, intelligent, arrogant youth; like how life shouldn't be all about work and success there is also binge drinking and sexual exploitation to think about.The characters are rubbish, laughs were thin on the ground and the story predictable, trite and boring.",The Internship
67,phubbs,The Internship,2,11 November 2013,"Vaughn and Wilson are back together yet again in yet another screwy comedy that really feels totally dated, what year are we in here 2000?!. Straight away I can tell you this film is a complete waste of time and money which feels nothing more than a big advert for Google.The story follows two middle aged blokes who become unemployed so they try their luck in an internship programme with Google. The fact these guys are clearly out of place and ten times older than everyone within this programme doesn't phase them as they go for broke to try and gain full time employment. Do they achieve their goal?? well that's the million dollar question isn't...yes they do, of course they do, this film is the most clichéd predictable piece of crud I've seen in a long time. Oh yeah spoiler...ah whatever.Google have really scored here, they have managed to get themselves a two hour in your face promotional campaign that has their company name in virtually every scene. If you didn't know about Google before you sure as hell do now, I think the word 'Google' must have been used a gazillion times.There is literately nothing to laugh at in this entire film, everything you see is just a tired rehash from every other Vaughn/Wilson comedy. The two leads play exactly the same type of characters we've seen over and over again which they do well sure but its just soooooooo old now. The rest of the cast are a bunch of unknown kids that you don't give a crap about, couldn't care a less whether they get these jobs or not...even though we know damn well they will.I'm not even sure what level this film is aimed at. At first I thought it was a gentle comedy for all ages with nothing threatening at all, no bad language or toilet humour etc...Then slap bang in the middle there is a sequence within a strip club with full on boobies and ass action that is most definitely adults only!. Its quite a departure from the rest of the film which is a light hearted boring wet mess.Basically you've seen this film before, the plot is completely predictable right from the start, no surprises. The characters are clichéd and unoriginal, every turning point in the film is unexciting, generic and unoriginal, Wilson still has that stupid soppy hairstyle, its not funny, its not entertaining, its just a sneaky corporate recruitment video. Come work for Google and have all the fun and success that Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn had in the coolest working environment ever!...(fun, success and cool working environment not guaranteed).2/10",The Internship
68,aciessi,Same old schtick But better,6,17 December 2013,"As with most moviegoers, I am kind of getting sick of seeing Vince Vaughn playing the same character in movie after movie. Unfortunately, what worked in 2005 simply doesn't work now, and the guy just doesn't know when to call it quits with that fast-talking schtick. But with the magic of Wedding Crashers in mind, that is what suckered me in to seeing The Internship. I knew I might have shelled out a good 12 dollars to see a dud, but its the first movie practically since Wedding Crashers that paired Vaughn and Wilson together again. Perhaps lighting could strike again?Well. no it didn't. But the effort to do so was present, and the effort was worth while. Vaughn and Wilson are back in action playing pretty much the same ""wedding crashers"" from the 2005 flick, but this time unemployed and desperate for attention. Their roles kind of switch from frat boy creepos to crafty con-men as they swindle their way into an amazing internship at the illustrious Google headquarters. They take advantage of all the Google liberties and pretend to talk the Google lingo. This in turn supplies plenty of comedic energy and a few inspired moments. But its the formulaic underdog story that rears its ugly head again and grounds familiarity and shameless sentimentality to the film, and thats what hurts it in the end. Not to mention, when the jokes don't work, they REALLY don't work. This has been an issue in the Vince Vaughn genre of films for nearly a decade, and he certainly hasn't fixed that issue. But regardless, I laughed and smiled enough to give this movie a fair recommendation. Not bad, but could have been a little bit better.",The Internship

Some really average scripting, some of it's good but much of it is directionless and misses the mark, that mark being funny.Falling into cliche after cliche is just more stones on the grave, and still not it's worst flaw. Vaughn who wrote the script just doesn't seem to have enough GOOD ideas to fill an overly long film, let alone make them form a cohesive concept and land it.Aasif Mandvi's character is terrible.

71,bryank-04844,"The story and message of 'The Internship' are solid enough, but the movie has no twists or turns you can't see coming from ten miles away.",4,23 August 2015,"Much like 'Wedding Crashers', the pairing of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson in 'The Internship' seems to have potential for a lot of gut-busting laughs. Unfortunately, just like last time these two got together, we end up with a bland paint-by-numbers comedy that provides only a couple of laughs. Not making the situation any better, this one has a PG-13 rating in order to bring a broader and family-friendlier audience, and the entire movie feels like an ad for Google more than a comedy. That being said, the stars should still draw a decent opening weekend.Wilson and Vaughn play virtually the same characters they do in every movie they make. Here, they even seem to be the exact same character with no differentiating characteristics. Billy (Vaughn) and Nick (Wilson) have been salesmen all of their lives, selling watches, scooters and mattresses among other things. When their boss (John Goodman) informs them that the high-end watches they've been selling will be phased out due to people using smartphones to check the time, the two are labeled dinosaurs in a quick changing technological universe, and get fired.For no reason whatsoever, they apply to be interns at Google, which might hopefully lead to permanent jobs at the mega corporation. In an awkward but sincere interview, they land summer internships at Google's campus, despite lacking any knowledge of anything to do with a computer. They're clearly the oldest people in the room by over two decades, but hope that their old-school abilities to sell and lead will help them to start over late in life. Even though the odds are against them from the start, the movie's unbelievable predictability will instantly tell you how this will end.All of the interns get divided into groups to learn and compete in challenges including tech support, creating an app, and even a Quidditch match. Nick and Billy are paired up with a few young adults, all of whom are very smart and at the top of their classes in school, but all lack social skills. Much like every character in the movie, these new partners are entirely one-note as well. I had hoped for deeper characters and roles that didn't seem to be redundant.The band of misfits that form the team are: Stuart (Dylan O'Brien), the above-it-all hipster; Yo-Yo Santos (Tobit Raphael), the smart Asian kid with stern parents; Neha (Tiya Sircar), the only female in the group and a fan-girl of all things sci-fi and anime; and Lyle (Josh Brener), the team leader who has worked for Google for four years and guides the team in the right direction, but lacks confidence. These actors play their parts perfectly well and are fun to watch on screen, but can only go so far with the material they're given.Meanwhile, the villain is Graham (Max Minghella), a British student incapable of any type of friendship who steps on and belittles everyone he can. His over-the-top performance is annoying, but he's effective and will stop at nothing to defeat our rag-tag team. Rose Byrne plays the love interest for Wilson. Will Ferrell, Josh Gad, Rob Riggle, Aasif Mandvi and Gary Anthony Williams all turn up in small and forgettable cameos.Vaughn and Wilson do a good job of improving with each another and providing their same brand of humor from film to film. However, the script limits their ability to really go the extra mile or break off into something different and original. Director Shawn Levy, whose biggest projects were the 'Night at the Museum' films, goes out of the way to showcase Google. Rich primary colors constantly surround the building, which has multi-story slides, nap pods and comfy couches that are all very appeasing to the eye and almost feel like a fairy tale.The story and message of 'The Internship' are solid enough, but the movie has no twists or turns you can't see coming from ten miles away, and its formulaic comedy that we've all seen time and again runs dry quickly. Despite a great cast that should be capable of amazing comedy, the final result is unfulfilling. Save this flick for a video rental, as the only truly remarkable part is the creative end credit sequence.",The Internship
72,witster18,the only true spoiler here is the film itself,4,21 November 2013,"There is a funny moment early when Vaughn and Wilson have a web-meeting/interview-for-internship with google. Funny scene. THere's another funny scene soon after when the two problem solve on the eraser-board, but the REAL problem is that these two scenes are about the only two funny moments in the entire film.Past that we have endless/shameless product placement and Vaughn re-hashing old ideas from swingers etc. SOme of that wanted to make me puke. I don't know if Vaughn thought it would be cool to throw out those references, but it came off like an extremely lazy attempt at improvisation and writing.I think ""Swingers"" is a comedic masterpiece and just behind Office Space and Anchorman as one of the 3 funniest films of the last 2 decades, but boy it really feels like the apple fell far from the tree this morning. ANd I don't mean to pile on Vaughn for it - because he's the funniest guy in this piece of crap. Wilson is hardly funny at all here, and as for the rest of the comedic casting/writing - inept.THe films saving grace is that it does seem to have it's heart in the right place and some of the supporting roles are handled fairly well, albeit not in the comedic sense.BUT, in the end you have to ask yourself why? Why was this film ever made? Who sat down Vaughn and Wilson and what in the world did they say to them to sell them that this was a good idea? I knew better than to waste 10 bucks at the theater on this(50 actually with wife in tow and candy/drinks), and in hindsite it was an easy/smart decision. As a 1.20 rental at the redbox - it turned out as easily the worst of the 3 selections(Also rented The Way,Way Back - 7.5/10, The Conjuring - 6.5/10.THese guys should have been making ""Old School 2"" instead of this.

But you don't come to films like this for the story, you come to see Vince Vaughn riff-off and Owen Wilson do his quirky charm thing. The thing is, a story would be nice, too, and they should not be so obvious about not trying. Three nerds - the slut, the geek and the Asian straight-lace with the Tiger mum - need to realise that intelligence and book-learning are not everything. So Vince and Owen show them that alcohol abuse and treating women as mere sex objects is what life is really about - as long as you team-build while doing it. Hell yeah, say the nerds eventually, and Vince Vaughn for one has a life-affirming moment.Putting my po-face aside for a moment, there are a few laughs - well, sniggers - here, though mostly aimed at fat kids, women, Asians and geeks. So not exactly revolutionary humour. Vince Vaughn hardly gets out of first gear, and Owen Wilson reminds you he used to be good.

It certainly felt realistic to me, although it also felt like a 90 minute Google commercial. The filmmakers did a good job in giving the impression that young geeks live in a very different kind of world and speak a foreign language.

And so, lost in the age of high speed Internet, the instigative Vaughn comes up with a plan to climb to the top by starting at the bottom (of the top): a possible internship at none other than the giant search engine Google but that we've covered already.After a humorous cameo by Will Ferrell as Wilson's new boss, the obnoxiously horny owner of a mattress store, our hapless heroes enter the pearly gates of Google, California, both clashing noticeably with the young brainy hipsters: These include underdogs that become part of Wilson and Vaughn's team (competing against a snarky villain), each with their own annoying personalities... The worst scenes have the kids (who could never drive a film on their own) forced upon the audience with too much screen time. Meanwhile the two potentially funny forty-somethings wind up channeling Emilio Estevez to a computer generation's MIGHTY DUCKS.A filler love story between Wilson and a much too beautiful to be single Google employee resides amidst the bland tale of dorky, awkward phenoms – with two cool ""uncles"" providing lessons of good old fashion human interaction to counterbalance their antisocial personalities... making this a wannabe REVENGE OF THE NERDS meets THE WEDDING CRASHERS.But what THE INTERNSHIP ultimately feels like is a ninety-minute Google infomercial...

It has a good story, a believable plot, one big sponsor :) and a lot of mild mannered laughs on the way.I found it entertaining and nerdy, but you don't have to catch all the references to make it good, it does help knowing a bit about the techie side though. A lot of good references, a lot of good characters and great small and big stories along the way. It was funny and interesting, there were awkwardness and romance, drama and tension and it was all-in-all a very decent film.",The Internship

85,AvidClimber,Same routine with many clichés but still funny,6,22 June 2013,"The Internship is your basic reject team movie. I'm a big fan of Wedding Crashers, but taking the same routine into a different environment doesn't make a new film.The good. Uplifting. Funny. Nice characters. Some ideas have merits. The green and red paddle scene is hilarious, so is the club scene.The actors. Vince Vaughn follows his usual style, but is just a bit much in this case. Owen Wilson delivers a better performance, but was certainly limited by the script. The rest of the cast is mostly subpar to the exception of Aasif Mandvi.The bad. Unlikely scenario. The big finish is a bit too much, in tradition with Hollywood reject team flicks. The B and C stories are a bit empty.The ugly. Lots of clichés. A good number of very embarrassing scenes in the first half, and if you're like me, they're going to make you squirm. Corporate propaganda.The result.

87,buccaneer21,Makes Fun Of The Americans' Economic Difficulties,8,6 April 2016,"The Internship have received mixed reviews from numerous viewers and critics alike for various reasons such as being a primarily a Google ad; unable to provide laughter; having clichéd and predictable screenplay; and many more. It never did well in the box office. Vince Vaugh commented that the studio interfering and making it a PG-13 film instead of an R-rated movie that excluded its crude and raunchy humor was a big factor to it. The DVD/Blu-Ray provided two versions of the film and evidently there is a big difference in terms of the number of times the F-word was made and the breast exposure it had.But one could not discount the fact that there were other reasons why it does not compare to the other Vince Vaugh and Owen Wilson starrer - The Wedding Crashers - to which the movie is often compared to.The film is about two salesmen who lost their jobs and decided for a career change in becoming Google interns despite having no knowledge in computers and computer programming. Their journey from becoming interns together with their team members and predictably their becoming Google employees at the end was the focus of the story.These includes the values they have exchanged from the old members to the young members and vice-versa as well as overcoming the challenges they have met into being Google interns. The screenplay was evidently clichéd as there was nothing new found in it.If I could criticize the film,it apparently somehow makes fun of the country's current economic misery such as middle-age professionals losing their job years before retirement and being prompted to change careers and young graduates who feel having a bleak future.Too bad that the film does not address these issues and it instead treats it like a laughing matter. The conclusion of having the leads - the two middle-age former salesmen and their young members - getting a job at Google while subtly ignoring the other 95% including the villain Graham and his fat member who happens to be a Harvard computer science graduate and has a 2390 SAT score who are all left jobless leave a sorry note to the film.It was criminal to see many Nooglers in celebration at the end when they realize not getting accepting employment as the pizza was being distributed.",The Internship
88,maria2023,The Internship Could Have Been Effective Had It Dealt With Issues,8,3 April 2016,"Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson stars in another comedy that portrays successful salesmen that decided for a career change as computer programmers. Many of the scenes took place at the Google Headquarters at Mountain View, California.The movie presents two forty-something watch salesmen - Billy McMahon and Nick Campbell - based from Atlanta who lost their jobs after their company shut down.Billy convince Nick to try their luck at Google and apply as interns.After being barely convinced to be taken at a Google internship,the fun and excitement begins as both work their way into getting as Google employees as well as the adjustments they make into making their way with present employees of Google who apparently are mostly half their age and twice their IQ's. No question that Vaughn and Wilson try to recreate their success in Wedding Crashers while trying to spout a corporate message found on Google.Too bad that the movie isn't as successful considering that most of the jokes aren't as funny and one has to be familiar with computers to appreciate the jokes.Also,it is apparent that the movie turned basically into a two-hour advertisement for both Google and an IT career.What's worse is the fact that it makes fun and laugh at the the issues that the country is currently facing like many young Americans are worried and fearful about the future, a lot of professionals are into changing careers after they have been laid off from their companies as computers have taken over their jobs and that their jobs are being either offshored or outsourced elsewhere where cheap and inexpensive labor exists.It could have been more effective had the movie dealt with thess issues intelligently and provided hope for our current economic misery.Too bad that it doesn't and it basically relied on the comedic abilities of the leads which unfortunately aren't effective all the time.",The Internship
89,HelenMary,"pleasing funny Vaughan + Wilson classic, predictable and not outstanding",6,9 February 2014,"Vaughan and Wilson are great. You feel at home with their humour, and I love all the non-noughties (eighties/nineties) references, and the moralistic underdog makes good feeling. Not particularly realistic given how stringent Google must be, but it's nice that there is a film that shows that non-geeks and real triers can get a little bit ahead. Nice guys can prosper all that sort of thing.Not a brilliant film in terms of cinematography or direction etc, not a film that is going to ruffle any feathers or win any awards but there's plenty that is heart-warming, funny and entertaining. Its certainly a film that keeps your attention; Vaughan and Wilson don't let up. I liked the progress and pacing of the film and how whilst you knew the overall (likely) outcome you didn't know how it was going to come about.Loved all the geeky stuff vs the ""real world"" humour of Vaughan and Wilson's characters - especially the Quidditch match especially Josh Brener's (Lyle) pre-game speech - I liked his character! So good. The team were fun, all the different characters.Not suitable for all viewers - we saw the extended version so I don't quite see how the strip-club scene is suitable for a 12a rating, and that scene was pretty full on to the point that my viewing companion and I asked each other ""what's the rating on this?"" Nakedness aside, it was very funny, well filmed and fun. Will Ferrell's character was one that I didn't particularly like, but I'm not a fan of his anyway.Entertaining, fun and silly but not memorable particularly or challenging. If you get the chance, the making of the Quidditch scene was fun. Fantastic Flashdance references - done to death! LOL",The Internship
90,renegadeviking-271-528568,The Internship review,7,11 September 2020,"Billy McMahon (Vince Vaughn) and Nick Campbell (Owen Wilson) are two very good salesmen who find out that the company they work for has shut down and they no longer have jobs. To make it worse, all they know are sales and they do not have the skills to excel in the world of technology.Billy then gets both of them an internship at Google where they form a group with Stuart (Dylan O'Brien), Neha (Tiya Sircar) and Yo-Yo Santos (Tobit Raphael) with Lyle (Josh Brener) as their team manager. They are up against all other 15 groups and only one will get full time jobs at Google. The alpha team is led by Graham (Max Minghella) who takes it upon himself to demolish their team; as does Mr. Chetty (Aasif Mandvi) the head of the internship program.Throughout the film we have two main plot lines: one where we hardly see what the other groups are up to since its just focused on the rivalry between Billy and Graham's group- well more like Graham himself. And the second plot focused on Nick courting (does anyone use that word anymore?) Dana (Rose Byrne).The element of technology allows the writers to play a lot with the generation gap and that makes up for the laughs as it occurs over and over again. Some parts and lines were quite cheesy and groan-worthy though.But all in all it was really quite funny and well put together. Also the heartfelt scene wasn't so cliche which was good because I was watching out for that.Plus you get to see the inside of Google which was very interesting and entertaining. I was quite surprised that Google actually allowed them to film there because I always thought they were quite secretive. It really does look like the best place to work.To sum up:
PROS: Coming together of generation gap; comedic; technological element
CONS: A bit cheesy/corny at timesI give this a 7.5/10.",The Internship
91,Jerghal,Copy and Paste,4,8 October 2013,"Why Google ever agreed to actively cooperate on this god awful insult to it's own name will forever remain a mystery to me. 'The Intership' is a shining example of why Hollywood should quit making comedies altogether and stay the f*ck away from IT related stuff. The story is a copy and paste of the typical from zero to hero, loser to winner bullshit story you all must be sick to death of by now (I know I am). You get punched in the face with every imaginable cliché about computer nerds and group stereotypes. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn -the worst comedic duo since Hitler and Göring- do their typical fast talking/ranting act instead of something that would be actually funny. And why make it 125mins long, torturing people for 90 mins wasn't enough? Unfortunalty it made some money so some Tinseltown schmuck might think it'd be a good idea to try something similar again, but this really is a thing that should not be repeated ever again.",The Internship

93,mattiasflgrtll6,I'm really baffled I liked it.,8,11 May 2015,"From what I had heard, this was apparently NOT going to be a sharp poke at Google. That was really disappointing to hear for me, I would have loved to see them take the p'iss out of that company. I wasn't in the mood for this movie at all, but my mom insisted in seeing it since she's a fan of Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. So I sat down and watched it with her. I can't believe I'm saying this, but it was good! Yes, it WAS a commercial for Google and in the beginning the comedy was sometimes ruined by all the fancy-pansy talk about how great Google is. But after a while, when the movie started to be more about the characters themselves, I really began to like it more. Wilson and Vaughn's characters were really endearing and the actors really took their roles with a storm. Wilson's low-key acting was as good as always and Vaughn is quite a underrated actor. His unique way of delivering his lines and his expressive body language makes him a real treat to watch. The other characters those two hang out with, may seem one-dimensional at first, but are given real flesh and bone. Even Mr. Chetty, who by the way was excellently portrayed by Aasif Mandvi. The humor is also consistently solid. It's not hilarious ALL the time, but some scenes just made me cry with laughter, like Vaughn's character mistaking a regular wheelchair-bound teacher for Mr. Xavier. But it's not only the comedy that delivers in this movie. It's also the heart. When a comedy attempts being heartfelt, it can in many cases come across very clumsy and out-of-place, even in the funniest of movies. But here, it felt real and the ending where the whole team who had fought SO HARD for success finally made it, I was cheering. It truly is a feel-good movie. So yeah, it has one of the crappiest premises ever, but if you just watch beyond the somewhat slow start, you get a movie which is much better than you'd think.Watch the uncensored version though. Can't miss out on John Goodman swearing profusely!",The Internship
94,MJB784,Forgettable and boring,4,21 May 2018,"Boy did I just just watch a very disappointing comedy: The Internship. It had a few laughs, but was mostly boring and had nothing to do with internships. The characters were trying to get a job as interns and finally succeeded at the end of the movie. I usually don't give spoilers, but I was hoping the story dealt with how you intern Google rather than wanting to intern at Google.",The Internship
95,rgblakey,Wilson and Vaughn apply for The Internship,4,23 June 2013,"After Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson unleashed the fun of Wedding Crashers they became a hot team that fans could not wait to see doing their thing again. When the trailers for their latest collaboration The Internship hit they looked fairly amusing, but had that vibe that the film could easily go either direction. Does this film capture the same magic as the Wedding Crashers or is it just a forgettable add for Google as feared? The Internship follows two salesmen who lose their jobs and are determined to prove they are not obsolete in this digital world. When they find their way into an internship at Google, they must prove that they are not obsolete but a necessity to the new age workforce and themselves. This film has taken a beating in the box office as well as reviews, but isn't nearly as bad as some have made it out to be. That being said it doesn't offer a whole lot either. Sure there is the argument of it being one big commercial for Google and it is on some level, but these days every movie has some sort of product placement, they just weren't as subtle about it. Sure they could have told the same story with a made up company name, but then who knows if it would have changed the dynamic. This film is a far cry from what they delivered in Wedding Crashers, but does have its moments. While most of the film is predictable and nothing all that original, it's Vaughn and Wilson that make it work way better than it probably should have. Wilson is his usual whispering self and at times does feel like he is phoning it in, but for the nature of the character works fine. Vaughn brings his signature quick wit and delivery that helps to elevate some aspects of the film from mediocre to decent. There are some really funny moments, but sadly there are some pretty slow moments in the middle that could lose people pretty quick.This is one of those throw away comedies that will probably be more entertaining as a rental than a full price theater outing as long as you keep expectations low. The story is pretty predictable and of course unbelievable in relation to the work they are supposedly doing, but if you put that aside and enjoy these guys then check it out when it hits the rental shelves as you will be able to find the fun a bit easier if you don't pay as much.",The Internship
96,Bravesfan17,Vaughn and Wilson lead a great ensemble in a fun film,8,7 June 2013,"Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are doing another buddy comedy film eight years after the huge success of Wedding Crashers. This time though, they are doing a workplace comedy film co-written by Vaughn and directed by Shawn Levy, whose other directorial efforts include the Night at the Museum films, Date Night, and Real Steel.Vaughn and Wilson star as Billy McMahon and Nick Campbell, best pals and salesmen who work together selling nice watches to retailers. The film begins with them having a dinner with a client (Gary Anthony Williams). When Billy and Nick try to sell the client watches to supply his store, he ends up having to tell them that their company folded up shop. When they try to talk to their boss (John Goodman), he really doesn't care and leaves Billy and Nick out of jobs. Billy's girlfriend (Joanna Swisher) ends up dumping him and he goes job searching, while Nick reluctantly takes up a job working as a salesman at a mattress store with his sister's unusual boyfriend (Will Ferrell). Shortly after, Billy comes to Nick with the offer for them to be in an interview for an internship that may lead to a job with Google, as Billy says it. After the interview, the main bosses all decide on who they allow to be a part of their internship. The bosses are unsure of allowing them to be a part of it. After one of the team leaders speaks up for Billy and Nick, they are let in.Billy and Nick meet a few interesting people. One of the first people they meet is Graham Hawtrey (Max Minghella), an arrogant fellow intern who is rude and pushy and think everything should be his. The main boss of the interns, Mr. Chetty (Aasif Mandvi), has high doubts about Billy and Nick. Nick starts having a crush on employee Dana (Rose Byrne). They meet Lyle (Josh Brener) who was the guy who spoke up for them and ends up as their team manager. Their other teammates were Stuart (Dylan O'Brien) who acts like a hipster, Neha (Tiya Sircar) who talks like she's a popular girl, and Yo-Yo (Tobit Raphael), a conscious guy who punishes himself by plucking out his eyebrows. The rules were that all the interns were teamed up in groups of five and the winners of their contests in the internship received job offers.Without going much farther into the story, I can say that Vaughn co-wrote a fun story that he could star in about a contest to earn a job. I found the story to be entertaining and enjoyed the contests the interns had to do. Vaughn does a good job as Billy McMahon, who is responsible but can get nervous. He also gets to be funny with the Flashdance references. Wilson is fun as Nick, who knows when to stand up and both are great as the life experienced guys who show their teammates how to loosen up. I have never seen Brener, O'Brien, Sircar, or Raphael appear in anything prior to this film, but I thought they all did fine and it was nice to see some new faces get a chance to show what they can do. Rose Byrne is enjoyable in her role as the workaholic Dana, but limited. Max Minghella is a bit of a riot as the arrogant intern who wants the job for himself.It was fun to see Goodman make his cameo for two scenes. Ferrell's cameo is just one scene. Director Shawn Levy even makes a funny cameo as an annoyed Google employee who is trying to take a nap while Nick is talking to Dana. Levy also does a good job directing this film, and I think he has gotten better as a director with each film I see him do.",The Internship
97,ThreeGuysOneMovie,Not as risqué as Wedding Crashers but lots of laughs,8,7 June 2013,"This film certainly recaptures the magic of the Wilson/Vaughn comedic pairing. Despite the fact the comedy was a bit less risqué this time around, the film still had plenty of laughs. The crowd was certainly into the film as the theater was filled with folks laughing uproariously at many scenes in the film. A strong point of the script was it managed to point out the foibles of both 20 year-olds and 40 year-olds. I have not laughed so much watching a film in a long time.Well they aren't re-inventing the wheel here or anything but The Internship is a legitimately funny movie and an enjoyable watch.

This comedic film tells the story of how two watch salesmen -Billy and Nick =who lost their jobs after their company have shutdown and the owner decides to retire in Florida. It was explained in the story that they lose their jobs due to the Digital Age as there is less need for watches as people nowadays look at time in their cell phones. When both tried to get back to the job market, they decided to apply at Google.Surprising,both got accepted and have to go to an internship to compete with other tech savvy interns to get the coveted jobs at the Google Headquarters located at Mountain View,California.Apparently,both former salesmen are together with those who are considered rejects such as . But nevertheless,will Billy and Nick's group obtain the coveted Google jobs?Your guess is as good as mine.Obviously,the movie has already set up the storyline right at the beginning. The only thing that could be great at the movie is the journey their group has to go through. Too bad that it is by the numbers comedy that comes up short to greatness.We know that the underdog theme comes into the picture in the storyline.With regards to eliciting any laughter to the viewer,both Vince and Owen comes short.The same is true with the rest of the cast that includes cameos from John Goodman and Will Ferrell.What is worse is that a lot of the jokes are unfunny and corny.The movie just provides the viewer a glimpse of the Google Headquarters as the film shot on location and exposition the products that Google has throughout the film.It was good to note that both Vince and Owen also gets to greet Google founder,Sergey Brin by calling him,""Hello Boss!!!"".

And if so, if you can get around the idea of these two grown men trying to compete in the brainiac world of young computer geeks..and then if you can get past the part where these two grown guys seem determined to introduce a bit of moral breakdown to a bunch of these little geeks in a fit of night life debauchery...well, then. Given all that, you will probably enjoy this movie and find some laugh out loud moments along the way. I love Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. And it really isn't a bad movie, in fact there's some cute and funny stuff here.

But despite some glowing reviews already posted, and having watched the movie on opening night, I was disappointed and often bored. The film admittedly had a great idea, where two near middle age guys manage to intern at Google, although their computer knowledge is practically nil. Of course you know right away they will eventually succeed and gain employment. But the film is frenetic, and there is a lot of fast nerdy talking, and while the audience I was with had a few chuckles, they were mostly quiet. As two-thirds of the critics panned the film, I have to reluctantly agree with them, not because Google was in it, but because it was about 20 minutes too long and must have seemed funnier to the actors and writers than it plays on the screen.

The most interesting thing is the focus of Google's idea of job: a comfortable world in which you are followed and treated with respect, and in which competition is awarded more for group spirit than for material efficiency. If these features are really proper of Google universe or if they are just a sort of promotion of the brand (sometimes it seems like this), we can't say; but it is sufficient, added to Wilson-Vaughn energy, to make the movie appreciable even if not wonderful.",The Internship
105,horizon2008,Pigs Swill,1,31 July 2013,"I once heard someone say that chart music is music for people who don't like music. I couldn't agree more. Daytime radio in the UK sucks, and the playlist totals about 20 songs which get played over and over, every single day. No originality, nothing to inspire, nothing to get your teeth into - just like this movie. The Internship is basically a film for people who don't like films.Just what section of the cinematic audience this pile of tripe is aimed at I really don't know. Maybe it's teenagers, those Dre wearing plastic headphone types who like to think they live in a land of cool and internet worldliness, but then it features two middle-aged heroes trying to find a job at Google so how does that compute? Pardon the pun.Is it aimed at confused adults then? Showing two hapless characters, trying to connect with the modern world, creating havoc along the way, some slapstick laughs, poking fun at our internet based lives, and generally piling on the jibes at web nerds expense? Erm, maybe, but then.... this movie is about as funny as root canal. What you get here is a headache inducing, cerebral bombing, diarrhoea of pointless noise masquerading as ""cinema"" which is the aural equivalent of a strobe light for your earholes. Not one aspect of the dialogue herein is worth catching. I suspect that the makers just thought that if they hit you with a blur of meaningless words, really really quickly, you might think you saw something of unapparent usefulness. The result being, a sensation of getting an electric eggwhisk inserted into your brain and switched on.I find it sad that either someone thought there was a market for this total waste of celluloid and time, or even worse...that somewhere out there, there actually are people who enjoy garbage like this. I guess it may actually be the latter as we live in a world slowly descending into mediocrity and superficiality, and here, this movie is king.I feel embarrassed to say I saw this movie, because I know someone is laughing somewhere after cashing in on knowing it's easy to feed pigs anything and they will eat it.

Stop being so cynical and enjoy the film for what it is. I felt no distraction being about Google at all - that's not even the main star at all. The film simply wouldn't work if it used a generic company - all the references mock the real world and Google themselves... I don't even use Instagram and the whole gag about Exchangeagram literally made me laugh out loud. (I don't ""LOL"" easily) Yes, the film is stereotypical but at the same time, it makes fun of it well and the witty dialogue and delivery/characters makes up for it.The film has heart and a great message. Excellent casting and acting by the kids. Everyone just fit their character/image just right, like the the kid who played the antagonist and the Google director. I really don't enjoy cheap humor like the ""3 stooges"" where they just hit each other or any other comedy films where they just act stupid and dumb and expect us to laugh. (Seriously I don't understand what's so funny about seeing people smoking weed in a movie; some people are so easily amused.) The funny parts of this film comes in the writing and the delivery by the characters. Will Farrel has a cameo appearance near the beginning, but those scenes aren't what I find to be funny, so you have to bare with some scenes. (He did fit the role perfectly well playing an annoying ahole)The film also brings up some very true points about today about having a degree doesn't guarantee a job and technology is not everything. I really wasn't expecting these types of film to have a deep message.I really enjoyed the dialogue and you won't find it entertaining if you don't understand the references.While the film does have a nice message, I can see strict parents or older folks getting offended by the language/sexual references/drinking scenes.People who hated this film are definitely cynics or just getting way too old and just need to stick with Citizen Kane or something...Worth watching!",The Internship

The description says their way of life has been destroyed and they must change to be like young kids...but based on the previous statements, they're not going to, they're going to make the kids adapt. And like some real action Monsters University, that's pretty much what happens; the kids are made out to be geniuses who spend all their lives in the technology bubble and have no idea about how to cut it in the real world, while the lead actors are portrayed as Luddites, with a gift of the gab and charm. Their two worlds collide, they both rub off on each other and come out the other end with a mix of people skills and tech skills. Which seems to be what Google wants people to see its products.The premise is far fetched; neither of the main characters looks to own a smart phone or computer, yet they get an interview for Google. Yet that's part of the story; everyone has the ability to succeed, even if you're not part of the ""in crowd"". And while there is lots of yellow/red/green imagery, Android imagery dotted around, and plenty of tech related dialogue, there are no overly long coding sequences. The action flows. If it wasn't Google - with its wide base of user known tech - the story line would have fallen flat after a few minutes.The stereotypes fly thick, and I can understand why Will Ferrell would want to be uncredited; it's not his finest role. The good kids have a nice mix of character traits to make them interesting, though the intern protagonist is to stereotypical (with an equally irritating English accent). It's a pretty written by numbers under dog story, and if you haven't seen Dodge Ball or Wedding Crashers, watch them first.P.S. I can't put WYSIWYG as a summary (as it's deemed as shouting), but if I put wysiwyg it gets corrected to upper case! Glad I don't need to phone Vince Vaughn for assistance.",The Internship
109,moviescoundrel,"A funny insightful look at hard work, teamwork, and Google",8,7 June 2013,"I actually thought this was going to be much worse than it was. I saw a 10 p.m. show and was fully expecting to sleep for at least 10 minutes due to the 2 hr. run time (2 hrs for a comedy usually means some unnecessarily long unfunny moments). Fortunately though, there weren't many down parts and the cast and plot was pretty entertaining for the duration. The movie was surprisingly funny much of the time. Most of the jokes were centered on the situation of Billy and Nick being out of their comfort zone and technologically illiterate to those around them. They start out as obvious dinosaurs with nothing to offer their younger group members (all of the degenerate, unwanted individuals are forced into one unlikely to succeed group). As time goes on however, they teach their group members some invaluable lessons about living life and teamwork that only these forty-something year olds could offer.As I mentioned earlier, there are many funny parts. Whether it is Vaughn and Wilson trying sweet talk or speed talk their cohorts or others into approval, most of the time when rambling they can usually talk someone into something, but when trying to explain a debugging issue they sound ridiculous and obviously so; The more technologically literate interns surpass the old guys in every computer way possible until the final leg of the movie. One of the funnies scenes involved Nick working for his sister's boyfriend (Will Ferrell) at a mattress store. The dialogue and interactions were great and it made me realize how long it's been since Ferrell starred in a comedy that was funny..""The Other Guys""? (I don't count ""Casa de mi Padre"" or ""Everything Must Go"", and I didn't love ""The Campaign"")I personally liked some (I'm sure very little was actually revealed) of the insights to the Google campus and some of the Google technology. As one who uses much of this technology often, and even teaches many of the things, it was cool to see relevant current technologies being used, even if some if it was in the wrong context and may just have been a screen capture.for full review and more full reviews go to moviescoundrel.com",The Internship
110,seveb-25179,Too many musical montages...,4,2 September 2017,"Any comedy film with more than one or two montage sequences, backed by a familiar or quirky pieces of pop music, sets off an alarm in my head.It's a sure sign of a lazy script that hasn't been worked through properly. The writer can't think of decent dialogue to move the plot or characters from A to B and so resorts to a montage to produce a ""magical"" transformation in the characters point of view.I like Vince Vaughns shtick, but unfortunately far too many of his movies resort to this shallow technique to move the plot along, instead of spending a bit more time and working out how to tell the story properly.I may be wrong, but I think Wedding Crashers had only one major montage I can recall, but in films like this and ""Delivery Man"" the whole second half of the film seems to consist of them.I've seen ""Swingers"" and ""Made"", so I know you can do better Vince, so please try harder in future!PS Is going to a titty bar, where people are friendly to anyone as long as they get paid, really the answer to overcoming social awkwardness?",The Internship
111,hkauteur,HK Auteur Review - The Internship,7,11 January 2014,"The Internship has the misfortune of being wrongfully marketed by its trailer, which sells one of the film's throwaway jokes about the X-men movies as if it was the best kneeslapping joke in a cheap goofy comedy. I scoffed when I saw the trailer, but The Internship isn't entirely what its trailer represents to be. What is hidden from everybody is that it's also partly a drama delivering a positive message about striving forward and taking risks in life.For the most part, it's a charming comedy drama. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson play to their own strengths. Vaughn always had a natural salesman type quality and here he really sells that.The stark contrast between Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson's characters, who are old school salesmen, and the young tech-savvy geek kids is overly exaggerated. The film acts as though being an face-to-face type salesman means never coming into any contact with the internet, smart phones and have no knowledge of contemporary popular culture. This is primarily where the comedy is drawn from and it all varies from a laugh to a chuckle to no laughs. The comedy fares better when it doesn't draw from that character contrast. One noteworthy gag was the Google team building event where they all played a faux Quidditch match. That was knee-slapping hilarious. Are team building activities at Google really that much fun?In the end, the sincerity of The Internship's life affirming message is somewhat tainted by the fact that the film plays like a Google recruitment ad. For a viewer that may be taken back by the big blatant advertisement will probably not enjoy the film very much. It didn't bother me much because there was just enough sincerity and laughs to pull me through the commercial-like aspects. That is the dividing line between audiences who will be charmed by The Internship or be turned off by it, because strictly speaking it is a bit of a mixed bag.",The Internship

Yuck. It is really just Google jerking itself off and gloating to everyone about how great they are. So disgustingBesides that self-servicing premise, this is just a lame and tame rehash of Wedding Crashers.

115,holyspiritdriven,Lowered My View of Google While Bring Nothing New to the Table,3,30 December 2013,"The Internship is guilty of what so many movies have done with Adam Sandler and Will Farrell. They used a ""caricature"" of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson and I have a feeling they turned them loose for some improv comedy that did not deliver. Their characters in the movie are two cliché ""down & out"" guys who lose their overly simplified jobs as salesmen (depicted as a job for tech-challenged ""dinosaurs"")and decide to try out the internship program at Google, despite knowing nothing about computers. Their relationships with each other and the rest of the cast come across as forced and offered up only a few laughs. Enter Google, the futuristic, Utopian workplace that employs only young, good-looking, smart people that our two goofy heroes somehow manage to trick their way into an internship with. < sarcasm > Hilarious adventure ensues < / sarcasm > The characters, who seem like phoney cliché personalities themselves, end up teaching the dinosaurs about their world and in turn learn some lessons from the old guys. There are plenty of fantasies that come true for the movie stars that never happen in real life (like the kid getting a free lap dance)all the while the dialogue moves along in lightning-fast, pre-programmed, impossibly witty banter. In the end each character's story is summed up nicely except the villain who gets what's coming to him. All the good guys come rolling in like rock-stars in front of everyone to surprise you and win! (No way!)All the while a giant Jib-Jab video of them play on the screen on stage (Really? Jib-Jab? Why not the animated gif of the Hampster Dance?) I really feel like I've seen this movie before... That was just the plot...the other part the gets this movie such a low rating is that I feel like it was written by Google just help them look even better to the public while they slowly infiltrate our lives and take us over. Behind those colorful letters and image of being the funnest place in the world to work, is a borg-ran, tech company that's got its powerful tentacles in every aspect of our lives. First it was a search engine, then mail,then they took pictures of the entire world & now for the coupe-De-gras: winning your heart through a cheesy, heart-felt, Disney-esque movie with big-named actors playing underdogs who win in the end.

116,kalibeans,Don't automatically skip this just because you are 55+,7,7 September 2014,"Watching this movie was kind of an accident for me. It was a free HBO weekend and late at night unable to sleep I wanted a comedy, not something serious and chanced upon this. Very pleasantly surprised! First it amused me that Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson were playing the ""seniors"", being as they are decades younger than me. Also being mostly computer illiterate I totally understood their utter confusion at the slang and terminology being used all around them. This is not an award winning film, nor will it become a classic, but it was a most enjoyable couple of hours and I thought the storyline was very interesting. It also had a pretty good message about the importance of still taking the time to be a part of the world around you and not just experience it all on a computer screen. So don't just assume you will not enjoy this film if you yourself are a senior citizen. It's worth a watch.",The Internship
117,MoviesReviews101,Verdict: Solid Comedy,7,8 November 2014,"Story: In the new tech heavy world, this is a good story showing how that the people who never grew up with the tech world could be lost in the world of jobs when they get left behind. Not only this we get to see how a group of misfits can come together to make a team. We see how younger people still think it was OK to treat each other differently because of image or background but as soon as you put that a side people see the real potential in someone. This also encourages people to take a risk that could change their lives forever. On a negative side we get a flimsy romantic angle for Owen Wilson character that doesn't get enough time to shine and plays out like a carbon copy of the 'Wedding Crashers' angle. In the end it really is a film that shows how hard it really is to find out who and what you are meant to be, but with the right people you could find out about yourself. (7/10)Actor ReviewVince Vaughn: Billy a top salesman who along with his partner Nick lose their jobs. He also loses he girlfriend and tries to figure out where to go next in his life and career. He discovers about an internship at Google and along with his partner Nick takes a chance there. He doesn't fit in with the other younger interns but he uses his skills to motivate his team of outcasts to compete and work as a team against the others after a job. Good performance from Vince in a role he will always work in the quick talking man. (8/10)Owen Wilson: Nick partner of Billy who after he loses his job lands a salesman job with his brother in law but reluctantly goes along with Billy's plan at Google. He shines in the position learning the computer skills needed and with the chance meeting with a girl of his dreams Dana he tries to impress her with his new skills. Good performance making a perfect double act with Vince. (8/10)Rose Byrne: Dana the successful Google employee that constantly gets followed by Nick as he tries to get to know her, before she agrees to go on a date. Good performance from Rose, but the role isn't used as much as it should have been. (6/10)Aasif Mandvi: Mr. Chetty the head of the training program who reluctantly accepts Billy & Nick into the program. He takes an instant dislike to them and clearly sees they don't fit in with the rest of the programs. He is strict but he wants the best for the job roles. Good performance showing a good authority figure for the competition. (7/10)Max Minghella: Graham a cocky English intern who thinks he has the job in the bag, he treats his team badly because he thinks he is the best and always trying to put Nick & Billy's team down. Good villain performance but also been there seen that.

(7/10)Dylan O'Brien, Tiya Sircar, Tobit Raphael: Stuart, Nehe, Yo-Yo the rest of the team who all have difference but come together to work on getting their dream jobs thanks to Billy & Nick's leadership and life skills.

119,InMyHonestOpinion,A huge and very expensive ad,3,26 December 2014,"A giant advertising campaign is what this is, all for Google and slightly Apple, and they definitely make sure we know it. I lost count of how many times the name Google was mentioned, splashed across the screen, and of course how good it is to work for Google. Which is pretty much what the film is all about. Vince Vaughn who plays Billy McMahon and Owen Wilson who plays Nick Campbell lose their position in their current jobs where they have pretty much worked for half their lives working for the same guy selling one thing or another in a door to door manner and on a whim decide to get in and set up for their future. Google has their answer, beginning with a Google Internship. The usual chaos ensues in the adventure land that is the Google workplace. The guys are last to be picked with a bunch of other misfits who then in turn of course teach each other the way life works, from everything from drinking to picking up the opposite sex as well learning new terminology and how to work the Google helpline. Throw in a game of Quiddich, a strip bar, the Google bus and car, create a new app and this pretty much is the story of Internship. Oh I can't forget about the protagonist, what's a loser's club film without a protagonist this time played by Dylan O'Brien at Stuart a British upstart who is definitely better than anyone else, once again been done and a hell of a lot better. Funny this was not, I didn't laugh once it's another one of those films where we see the best bits in the trailer so everything from then on in is all new and unfortunately not at all funny, they do try and Owens attempt at being an asshole over a 10 year span at a meal is a little comical but that was about it. I felt the entire film was a sequel to The Wedding Crashes, Vince and Owen are exactly the same characters perhaps a little less selfish but none the less, they are the same, at least in the Wedding Crashes they were actually funny! No real stand outs in the supporting cast either even Rose Byrne who plays a working to live, time poor upper manager at Google was wasted in her role. I wasn't impressed by this at all, it really couldn't be anything more though no matter who starred in it, who directed or if it was based around Apple or Bing. If you want to know what this is really like think Revenge of the Nerds or Meatballs without the tits, and that's pretty much what you have. It's supposed to be a film that leaves you feeling or googly and sweet and to a degree it does I just wish it offered more.",The Internship

Its just plain awful. and the sad thing I actually paid to rent it.... kidding myself for doing that.. Hoping this review saves people from the train wreck which is this movie. How in Gods name did they make this movie, I can only imagine it was paid by Google itself. At least when the made the Facebook movie it had a little bit of acting, this thing has nothing its just a waste of space. No redeeming factors at all to the movie. Sad thing is that 14 year olds will see the movie and think the job market is like this,,, it isn't .. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn reuniting almost a full decade after their raunch-filled ""Wedding Crashers.""Here, their humor is much tamer -- if not particularly wiser -- with the aging frat boys actually playing father figures to a group of genius outcasts trying to win work at tech-giant Google.

I'm a big fan of Google and of the 'campus' lifestyle for adults. This movie has been done so many times in other settings. I'm really surprised Google went along. Did they get a free ad, or did they have to pay to be in the movie? I gave it a 2 because I've seen worse this year. It's just either totally predictable or just dumb. How about the real life Quidditch match? Running around with one hand on a broomstick between your legs while playing hand soccer with the free hand?Or the evening getting wasted at the Titty bar? We get to see dozens of silicone tits in Silicone Valley while the wannabe Google interns do lap dances and shots to help guide them onward to winning their competition.

124,youngman44,Super Enjoyable,8,10 June 2013,"I go to the movies to be entertained - not to find ways to criticize. But, if a movie is bad or mediocre, it's bad or mediocre and I'm happy to say so. This movie, however, was neither bad nor mediocre. It was just a very enjoyable film. Not a spectacular-fall-out-of-your-chair-laughing-hysterically comedy. But, a really good story and one that had plenty of solid humor, joy, entertainment and a few poignant moments. It simply worked. What's wrong with that? Vince Vaughn was his classic self. He has his own unique humor niche carved out and he had several of his classic, near stream-of-consciousness riffs for which he has become iconic. He also carries a humorous sarcastic-warmth to him that reminds me (in his own comedic way) of some other warm comedic greats who had a similar ability to be quite funny but generate some warmth in his films (John Candy comes to mind). As the story writer Vaughn had a great little plot and very good idea. I'm very happy he wrote a generally good story. There are a couple of explicitly humorous scenes - some comedy is a bit over-the-top gross here or there - but otherwise it is pretty ""feel good.""Owen Wilson is solid though not spectacular. But the Wilson-Vaughn combo is a great one. Not to the comedic level of Wedding-Crashers in this one, but still very good. The bottom line is the movie entertains and while it may not appease the snobbery of many critics, it is an enjoyable film and I hope it does well. Worth seeing for sure.",The Internship

Parts of it play like it was propaganda piece for Google. However, since I like Google if it was their idea it was great, if not, its great anyway.At its core this is a stupid comedy. Template-y. Think typical college humour movie, but set at Google internship facility instead of college/university.I find it little bit hard to believe that there could be two people in 40's completely ignorant of internet, even harder to believe that Google would seriously accept two such people as interns, but story is not really any more unbelievable than rest of films I saw in this category.I would probably get kicked out from internship like this one as I would be dating coworkers, bringing food back home, winning at Quidditch by any means needed, and my unique perspective on solving problems that might not really be politically correct, but I would still have loved to try it anyway.If you have no idea who X-Men are, or what is Google or Cosplay, you might not find humour appealing.Otherwise this is perfect movie to watch with bunch of friends.",The Internship
126,CSHaviland,"Cute, fun, a little tedious",6,9 June 2013,"With Bathroom Humor Comedies (Adam Sandler movies, The Hangover, etc) and RomComs being the usual comedic fair at the box office these days, it's refreshing to find a comedy that stands outside of that tiresome trend.The Internship was a cute movie that certainly has its chuckles. Google is actually a very odd work environment, and the movie makes good points about the depressed state of our modern employment climate for young and old alike. I think the movie tried a little TOO hard to polarize a traditional salesman with the high tech digital age, and some of the Vince Vaughn joke sequences seemed to get a bit tedious. But he played it so seriously that the overall effect was still amusing.The Vaughn / Wilson pair were VERY sufficiently embarrassing with their overzealous attempts at being team players in projects they didn't understand, and as I have worked deep in the internet business since 1996 I cringed harder than the Google interns who tried to cope with them. I was already a Director level manager in the internet when Google was just being founded, so I've watched the company grow from the ground up, and eventually sponge up the mega-companies that produced my primary worktools (such as Doubleclick). Having been interviewed for management level jobs at Google I can vouch that they can crawl up your ying-yang about your academic record, even if it's from the 80's and you have over a decade of real quality experience to replace it. I've been interviewed by Facebook, Yahoo and Amazon too, and only Facebook can take after Google in this way. It creates the perception of being the Mensa Society of the digital world - pretentious, exclusive, and only for IQ's higher than 170.That is not really the case, strictly speaking, but there is a culture there of self-importance that the movie bounced our heroes off of, and it worked for some laughs.All in all it was an enjoyable matinée break, but I probably won't be getting it on Blu-ray.",The Internship
127,ArtandJoyofMovies,Yawn!,5,27 June 2013,"A few laughs, slightly cute and little more. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn can do this bit with no script and half asleep. I am pretty sure they did. This movie has few ad placements other than the usual Apple Mac computer promo spots. The fact is, this movie IS a paid advertisement for GOOGLE, by GOOGLE and certainly paid for by GOOGLE, with a few dollars thrown in by the University of Phoenix. I hope this is not a road map of crappy, cheap comedies to come.Boneheaded, forty-something watch salesmen Nick (Wilson) and Billy (Billy) lose their jobs and apply for a competitive internship competition at GOOGLE with a flocks of 20 year old super nerds. Back to School (1986) with Rodney Dangerfield this movie is not. I believe the set up but I don't believe that Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn have not a single gray hair at their ages. Both need to start taking parts their own age.This film portrays GOOGLE as the breeding ground for world class nerds and lost romantics. Okay, at least it is truthful. One philosophy I found most provocative is that on the GOOGLE campus, all the food and lunches are free. However, it is a major violation at GOOGLE to take any food home. In other words, you only get food if, and while, you are working. For a bunch of bleeding heart liberals from California, this message seems about as anti-immigrant, anti- welfare as one can get. On the other hand, perhaps it is a message of communism–work for us and do as we say and we shall feed you. Stray and you shall starve. It seems strange because GOOGLE is the poster child of capitalism in America. Come up with a cool idea and make a few hundred billion dollars. But then the masses must kiss your ring and bow art your door. Worse, if you want to work there you are forced to engage in many circus like stunts and court jester antics—hardly a self esteem building exercise for the low esteem ""Noogles."" There are lots of mixed messages in between the all too rare guffaws in this film.I suggest googling ""laughs"" and see what turns up instead.",The Internship

131,faisal_khatib,Brilliant chemistry between the leads along with wonderful supporting actors,7,8 June 2013,"With the premise of an internship at Google; you get the whole deal with product placements. Luckily ""The Internship"" manages to stay afloat as a two hour enjoyable and rather funny Google advert.The film begins with Billy (Vince Vaughn) and Nick (Owen Wilson) losing their jobs as fast talking watch salesmen facing an uncertain future thanks to the digital age. Managing to talk their way into an internship (against all odds) at Google, they find themselves facing off against smart and tech-savvy college kids aka ""a mental Hunger Games"" for jobs at the on-the-line search giant. Ending up with a team of out casts and facing mostly unreasoned challenges (Read: Quidditch match), Billy and Nick manage to turn the odds on its head for the perfect (and predictable) ""Lived happily ever after"" ending.With previous individual failures Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson come together once more to share their amazing chemistry on screen. Vince Vaughen plays the exact same role he has played in every possible film you've seen of him lately. Since he's co-written the film; I guess he likes to feel right at home. The same may apply to Owen Wilson who's landed himself in a similar rut. It does make the whole process rather familiar but there is no denying that the chemistry both these lead actors share gives the films premise a new pair of legs every time it starts lagging a little. Both these actors clearly know their limitations and have managed to work around it well this time. Also since this was a PG-13 rated film, some of the vulgarity that you might associate with these actors is kept to a bare minimum reducing what I feel are just distractions.Tobit Raphel as home-schooled Yo-Yo was a complete scene stealer as more often than not he'd have you laughing out loud with his crazy antics on screen. Dylan O'Brien on the other hand balanced it with his controlled cynical act of 'know it all' Stuart. Tiya Sircar as Neha was brilliant as you watch her character go through its curve. Josh Brener as the 23 year old Team leader Lile starts off brilliantly as he tries to portray himself as a cool dude but fades away as the love interest angle falls into place quite predictably.Max Minghella as the films main antagonist Graham is underused and left with one-liners that are too far and few. Rose Byrne as Wilson's love interest apart from a single scene comes across as a postscript. Aasif Mandvi as the internship programs head Mr. Chetty is stereotypically brilliant and the short chemistry he shares with Billy is entertaining to watch.Brilliant chemistry between the leads along with wonderful supporting actors makes you forget the flaws and plot holes blatantly staring at you. You just go along with that warm fuzzy feeling with a smile plastered on your face.",The Internship
132,Rebel_With_A_Cause_94,"Entertaining, but very Forgettable",6,28 November 2013,"I love Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson and while I wasn't expecting Wedding Crashers, I was hoping The Internship would at least be another good comedy for the comedic duo. While it defiantly has some good moments here and there, this is a very predictable and forgettable comedy.As many have said, it is a bit hard to get past all of the Google product placement in the film. Vaughn and Wilson are good, but this really felt a the kind of comedy that should've been released in the 80's. The plot is predictable and cheesy. Also, there is no reason this film needed to be 2 hours. It was way too long and got boring after a while. Not really a good comedy even though it had some funny moments. The best parts were in the first 45 minutes.Not the worst. Not the best.",The Internship

Clearly Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are on the downhill slide as actors, and their attempt to revive the energy in ""Wedding Crashers"" was a dismal failure. There were so many contrivances to create laughs, and the film failed on every count. When we viewed, there were maybe 20 people in the theater, and not one chuckle or laugh was heard. There was one scene with Vince, Owen and Will Farrell that tried to revive ""Wedding Crashers"", but was so lacking in humor, it was truly grotesque, and completely mean-spirited. The writing on this film was below sophomoric level, and camera work, editing equally sub-par. If the producers were trying to portray a high tech company, like Google, they failed miserably. If they were trying to parody high tech culture, they also missed it by a mile! Thumbs down, my friends. This is a real dog.",The Internship

Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson are two veteran pitchmen who learn their current company has just gone out of business and, in a reality only Hollywood could create, there are no other sales jobs anywhere in the universe! We know this because Vince spends 3 minutes using Google (not Workopolis or Monster??) to find a new gig only to have a sudden and unexplained epiphany that the search engine he's using to find a job IS the job. Deep.What follows is a stock plot about the seniors taking on a group of outcast geek interns and teaching them to party, keep it real and - this is new - there is more to life than computers.The film, written by Vaughn, plays it very safe, heartwarming feel good lessons replace well, comedy.On the positive side, if you want to learn A LOT about the hipster, self absorbed world of Google this film is for you. Nowhere is the mega company joked about, ridiculed, parodied or in anyway presented as anything other than the ideal final destination for everyone on the planet who wants to ride silly colored bicycles and waste their lives typing code.Rent Dodgeball. A FUNNY Vaughn movie with the same plot.",The Internship

Loved their previous collaborations in Wedding Crashers and Starsky & Hutch . The third one together they had a great performance which is the main reason that I watched this movie but I don't know could've been better . There were some really funny parts but not to complete it into a great awesome movie . Maybe it was something with the script maybe I don't know just didn't fulfilled that great laugh that I had their previous films .

138,samgreer-694-680740,I heard that one before,5,9 June 2013,"Let me preface this by saying I love Vince Vaughn. Its impossible for me to watch any of his comedies without laughing, and I think he's nothing short of a brilliant comic actor. That's why it pains me to write this review.This movie has funny parts. Nothing that will make you lose control of your bladder, and despite what some people have been writing, this AIN'T no Wedding Crashers. This movie is more like an e mail you got 4 years ago that was hilarious, and someone sent it to you again. You forgot about it, opened it, and remembered how funny it was, but no joke is as funny the second time around. Big lack of originality here and Will Ferrel's character was not remotely funny. Unlike Wedding Crashers ""Chaz"" this character was more like the Starsky and Hutch cameo. Wasn't impressed with that, wasn't impressed with this.When you get the same group of actors together for ANOTHER comedy, you better have some seriously different writing. This movie badly needs some situational / physical comedy. Charles Xavier and the antagonist punching people is weak and lazy writing.There was one Mr. Bean quality situational comic scene in the movie that was brilliant featuring one of the supporting interns at a strip club, and you'll instantly recognize it when you see it. Other than that it relies heavily on jokes in dialog - which aren't bad. They are witty, and Vaugh's delivery is great. It's just that I feel like I've been there and done that. Wilson's love interest felt totally scripted to me - I'm not buying any of that, not for a dime. Waaay too rushed into instant love - kind of like, but even worse than, Wedding Crashers.If you choose to see this in the theater, go to a matinée. It isn't worth full price. I'd definitely watch it once it hits RedBox or Netflix. Well worth a couple bucks - $30+ at a theater, not so much.",The Internship
139,votesmall,"It's not perfect, but it's an above-average buddy comedy",6,25 November 2013,"Know what I love to do that I haven't done in a while? That's right! I sense a rant coming on!Okay, so it isn't actually a rant per se. More of a review since I did have a soft spot for tonight's film, called ""The Internship"". Although it's quite possibly the most derivative comedy I've ever seen, it did keep my attention and the ending made up for its flaws. Even though it was predictable, drawn out, overly sappy and sub par in almost every way, there was a certain charm to the film that contained just enough jokes to keep you laughing and just enough moments to tug at the old heartstrings. My only two real complaints about this besides a stunning lack of originality is the random Flashdance references that were not entirely accurate and the random, out of place strip club scene. While I'm glad that I didn't see this one at the theater, I am glad that I saw it. It's certainly not the worst comedy I've ever seen (Jack and Jill) but it also isn't the best (The 'burbs or A Fish Called Wanda). At the very least, this film is adequate but if you can get past the fact that it's essentially just a two hour Google commercial, it's worth a watch and sure to get you some laughs, despite the fact that many jokes are tasteless and drawn out. It certainly is better than anything Sandler has done since Click (and sure as hell better than Grown Ups or Jack and Jill) so for that I will give it credit for not relying on gross-out gags and sickening ""morals"". At the very least, the Internship is a return to the basics. Some will call it a nostalgia trip, myself included, to a time when Sandler films were actually good and films, although predictable, left you feeling good. This film left me with mixed feelings, owing mainly to the repetitive plot, product placement and script bogged down with drawn out jokes and stereotypes (particularly the scumbag villain). But all that is forgivable because in the end it is a simple tale about friendship and the American Dream, largely benefiting between the chemistry of the two leads. There was a poignant scene where the kids talked about how they felt hopeless and after the film ended I realized that I may have been too harsh on the first half because the second half completed the story arc and proved that if you believe in yourself, anything can happen. This is essentially a subtle modern fable disguised as a sub-par comedy. Fables teach. Bravo, Vince Vaughn.",The Internship

Well its not the best movie ever I was right to think it would be good. It was entertaining and just an overall good time.One of my favorite things about this movie were all of the nerdy references to things like Harry Potter and X-Men but also the more obscure 80's references that I admit I probably did not catch all of. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaghn were very good in this movie they both have really good chemistry with not only each other but the rest of the supporting cast.

142,tappingjeff,The Film That Wishes It Was a Google Chrome Commercial,2,2 July 2013,"THE GIST: Shawn Levy's latest film starring the dynamic duo of Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn is a far, far cry from their last collaboration, the hilarious WEDDING CRASHERS. The story is seemingly simple: two go-for-broke guys in their 40's are stranded without jobs and look for the most obvious solution to solve their unemployment, an internship at Google. Somehow, though being an unexpected choice, the two get picked for the internship (does the film LEGALLY BLONDE ring a bell?). What ensues is basically MONSTERS UNIVERSITY without the humor, heart, and inventiveness of that fine film. Instead we're left with a film that inspires less ""lol"" and more ""nla"", or ""not laughing at all"". I can't discredit the film for the promising premise that could have showed, and does to a certain extent, the incoming generations lack of personal skills due to technological social interaction or perhaps the struggle of aging and finding a place in the newest era. But no, all of these ideas are certainly too big for the rather dumb script (the characters end up getting in a fist fight at a stripper bar...remind me what this one is about?) that the actors make work moderately, except for Rose Byrne who seems to find footing somewhere as a Google representative that Wilson pines after. The multitude of ethnicity (besides our two main characters, who are both white) is certainly nice to see on the big screen, and there are times where the film really hints at something kind of good.THE BEST PART: The advertisement-loaded, yet creative and clever final credits sequence. Yes, the best part is the FINAL CREDITS.THE VERDICT: There's so much going wrong with THE INTERNSHIP. Had it been an indie film in the hands of the right creative team and script it could have been something worth watching. Instead, you're almost wishing you were spending the overlong 2 hour runtime investigating the products on screen. So at least Google got their money's worth.",The Internship

I really like both Wilson and Vaughan (particularly Vaughan for his Swingers movie)but this felt forced and totally unrealistic. I know this is a comedy, but for it to be funny, you first have to believe in the basic scenario, and I didn't, it's like they were approached by google to help create yet another product, a 'Hollywood movie'. There were a few funny lines, but it was cheese and ham for the most part, even showing us the scene with the 'sleep pods', just so corny, where the woman instantly divulges a lifetime of regrets, when just before, she thought Wilson was completely beneath her, immature plot development and writing in this film, real cookie cutter, super cookie cutter in fact, like it came out of an Indonesian movie sweat shop. I couldn't in good faith recommend it to anybody, unless you saw it on free to air, and the other choice was a a cordless vacuum demo on the shopping channel. I still hold out hope that these guys will reunite and hopefully make a half decent flick. I'm also noticing that the word 'google' is coming up as a spelling error when I submit this, they practically own the internet, what rubbish is this, an attempt at humility?

145,ckolet37,"Relatable, if not bland",5,28 June 2013,"When I saw the reviews for the Internship, my expectations dropped. A 29% on Rotten Tomatoes was a good enough reason for me to not see it in the theater, but go check it out on redbox later. But I saw it, with my parents too, and it had some great one-liners. That was its strength. I understand Vince Vaughn, and it's very hit and miss. I chuckled at the technological illiteracy of the two main characters, which made my parents laugh the hardest in a while. It is a great premise, a great opportunity for some great fish out of water stuff. Potential wasted, that's what this movie is. The more I look at it the more I feel that this movie could've been something great. But it's not great, it's mediocre at best. The story is extremely clichéd. There is a romance that doesn't need to be there, there is adversaries that do not need to be there. There are a lot of things in this film that doesn't need to be there. All I know is that this film could've been great and it wasn't. But what it does have that is good stands out and stays with you, which is more than you can ask for for a movie that has their second act go through a brutally long pop song montage. It's brutal.

147,StarDragyn,"Owen and Vince = great combo, BUT....",5,14 June 2013,"What could be better than a comedy with Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn? Well, maybe another one.I do like both of these actors a lot, and I was very excited about seeing another movie with the two of them starring together. But unfortunately it fell rather flat and often dragged on. After all, there aren't many 2 hour comedies out there, I think for a good reason.A lot of the focus ended up shifting to the ""misfit"" college-age interns that Owen and Vince were teamed with, and long sidetracks in plot spent...going kinda nowhere. There were several times where I was really wondering ""Why in the world do they have this scene? Or at least why did they spend 15-20 minutes on it instead of 4-5?"" Then of course there is the ""love angle"", but this felt very forced and contrived. I never felt that Owen and his lady love really had anything going on--other than the fact that script-writers/director/etc WANTED them to have something going on, and kinda shoved it into the crevices of the movie here and there, presumably hoping to please the female audience with some of that ""awww"" factor.Most of the movie is spent in more or less humorous situations, where our underdog heroes seem destined to flop but must band together and rally the team effort. The other main part of the movie is the Owince duo trying to ""educate"" the misfits on ""real life"". With a touch of (also contrived) character-defining drama to show that there has been some sort of development/progression. Otherwise it's mostly a series of loosely-banded comedy skits.But even the comedy was not at its height, and neither Owen nor Vince really shone like I've seen them do in other movies. Casually enjoyable, but I was far from rolling in the aisles (I think I chuckled a couple times).

I knew that if I go for the duo of these two comedian actor - McMahon and Campbell, I wouldn't be let down. It's full of witty dialogue. And we get an inside look to real life Google Office complex. The movie has been criticized for too much coverage of Google, where the action takes place, but I still think it won't devalue the comedy. The story line consists of overcoming adversity, personal hindrances and a love story, all the while covering them in a humorous manner. A good approach. And the jokes are very good, one of the kind, meaning they won't get repetitive or boring. And in the end, all ends well for all the characters.",The Internship
149,DangerAwesome,"Fast pacing and occasional laughs, never lags too badly",5,6 October 2013,"With neither Vince Vaughn or Owen Wilson turning out a good comedy in the recent past, I went in with pretty low expectations. Those low expectations helped me enjoy the movie more.The movie is not laugh out loud hilarious, but it does have occasional laughs. My favorite moment being in the short scene with Will Ferrell explaining his neck tattoo. The Internship does a more than competent job distracting you from the lack of laughs. The speedy pacing keeps you interested in the story, and it doesn't dwell on its own jokes too much. There's nothing worse than a bad comedy that pauses for laughs. That's one place where this movie succeeds.While I would call The Internship a very middling effort in terms of comedy, it doesn't commit any major offenses. Where it is a mediocrity as a comedy it distracts with a pretty solid feel good story.

The counter balance Owen is never to far from this first introductory role, which I think most people instinctively love, as it is a Zoolander experience over again. Owen has got a touch of nervous charisma as well, just so much less obtrusive. As for the film ... It's a mere exercise.

156,TyRawrrnosaurus,Late to the Party but Completely Harmless,5,9 June 2013,"Buckle up, because if The Internship is what you seek, prepare for an overly long, two-hour advertisement for Google riddled with outdated clichés. But despite the lack of ingenuity, this film turns out a pretty harmless attempt at humor with a little dash of heart. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson put in a great effort, but the once famed Wedding Crashers duo are hardly given enough room to grow.After being let go from their wrist watch company that went under, Billy McMahon (Vince Vaughn) and Nick Campbell (Owen Wilson) are labeled as dinosaurs, struggling to find a place in the world. Hounded by his sister to grow up and get married, Nick picks up a job at mattress retailer. Meanwhile, Billy comes to find his house under foreclosure with his long-term girlfriend leaving him to find his way. From having it all to hitting rock-bottom, the two salesmen find themselves in quite the pickle.Desperate, and apparently with no other options, Billy decides to enroll Nick and himself into The University of Phoenix in order to gain an internship with Google, that may or may not lead to employment. Convinced to take a leap of faith, Nick joins Billy in a video conference interview with the prestigious billion-dollar corporation. And wouldn't you know it, they nailed their interview in spite of their technological shortcomings.Arriving on Google's well-branded campus in northern California, Nick and Billy come to find they may be over their heads. Every Googler is connected to a device and in-tune with the modern age, while Billy has a hard time figuring out how to be ""on the line."" Having to pair off into teams during orientation, the duo join with a band of intellectual misfits also deemed unworthy of their talents by the rest of the interns.The socially awkward Lyle (Josh Brener) leads the rest of the group who consists of the cynical and distant Stuart Twombly (Dylan O'Brien), the sexually frustrated and geeky Neha Patel (Tiya Sircar), and the home schooled, over-protected Yo-Yo Santos (Tobit Raphael). This ragtag team of ""Nooglers"" – new Googlers – must work together with Nick and Billy in a series of challenges if they have any hope of landing a job.The Internship is an underdog story to its core; everyone must prove how much Googliness they have. Lyle's group is monitored closely by the highly critical Mr. Chetty (Aasif Mandvi), who leads the internship program, unafraid to openly express doubts in Nick and Billy. But an underdog story is incomplete without its villain, which is filled in by Graham Hawtrey (Max Mingella), the overly confident and snarky rival intern. Rose Byrne also appears as a Google employee who Nick sets his heart after. Her presence is basically a waste of time and plot development.With the pieces set in place, The Internship begins to tick off cliché after cliché from its checklist in order to drive home its not too subtle messages: Generation X cannot understand Generation Y, the economy is tough on college graduates in today's job market, live life to the fullest, be yourself, and don't be a jerk.Vince Vaughn, who wrote the story, positions Nick and Billy well as their own characters, separating them from the those they played in Wedding Crashers, John and Jeremy. But as a comedy, the jokes fall flat. The point that Nick and Billy are from a different era than their fellow interns is beaten to death and the whole film relies on this premise to work. It's been done before, but with much older actors.Nothing in the screenplay demands our attention nor does it create anything new for the viewer to enjoy. The challenges our characters are tasked to complete are hardly complex or inspiring – they play Quidditch for one of them – which ends up as missed opportunities reflecting poorly on Vaughn or Googles' creativity. One of the challenges is for the interns to develop a mobile app, and the movie dedicates an exhausting amount of time to this scenario with little pay off.Where The Internship tends to excel is within the character development. This young cast arrives on screen fairly unknown – Tobit's first role – yet they do a swell job at bringing their characters to life. The struggles that each one of our protagonist face creates a great team dynamic once they eventually learn to understand each other. Although director Shawn Levy (Date Night; Night at the Museum; Real Steel) fails to find a unique position on the genre, he is able to capture a positive energy that maintains a slow pulse strong enough to keep forward momentum.Even though Nick and Billy are fantastic salesmen, Levy has a hard time selling The Internship as a film that neither surprises or excites. The bland, archaic comedy minimally tickles the funny bone yet has so much heart and good intentions it is not unbearable to ingest. The Internship is rather forgettable, but isn't a complete failure due to the charisma of the cast and the movie's ability to embrace some of the weirder moments that provides enough life to make it passable.",The Internship

There is some funny moments, specially if you are a little nerd (like most of us are) and be able to understand some jokes. The ""Charles Xavier"" one is funny, but is not enough to support all the movie. The rest of the cast is too simple, too cliché. I'm getting tired of this two. They don't even try to make something new. And someday they will crash, real hard, and try to make some different movies.

It's very predictable and it's a 2 hour product placement advert but it's done with charm and verve. It also has it's heart in the right place and my grandson laughed in all the right places. He also leaned over at one point and told me how to write code. Of course he might as well have been talking Greek but he did enjoy my enjoyment of the Quidditch game. Like I said it's charming and a very pleasant way to spend two hours. Also the acting is pretty good, the script is tight and it hits the funny bullseye more than a few times.There is nothing wrong with a pleasant film about two lost men finding their way and showing the young kids that life's about more than hitting the correct keys on the keyboard.

From Karate Kid to Rocky, from Revenge of the Nerds to The Mighty Ducks. The formula is an old but tried one: first portray someone or a group as losers who life kicks in the chin. Then show them steadily grow, improve, give them a chance at winning but ... oh no! There's a setback! But, surprise surprise, they overcome the setback and win after all!Sounds familiar doesn't it? That's because it's been done to death and this is why this kind of movie has sort of died out. It's rather ironic that the movie is about two middle aged guys who are trying to ""fit in"" with a younger crowd when this is exactly what the movie is trying as well. A dinosaur of a concept used years after its peak.Now, this doesn't make it a bad movie, just very predictable: anyone who watches 5 minutes of the movie will know how it will end. At least Cool Runnings throw in a little twist at the end but this movie is so incredibly playing it safe that it feels I've watched it a thousand times before.As such it's a very by-the-numbers movie which won't surprise you for one moment.

163,omayfield,"if wasting talent is criminal, this would be a felony offense",1,1 December 2013,"I walked out of this movie about halfway through because of sadness. There is such aching sadness when I see talented and intelligent persons like Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, the great John Goodman for goodness sake and the charming actress Rose Byrne involving themselves in a project so limp, so soulless and spiritually and intellectually void as this worn out dishrag of a film. Why didn't someone stand up and say something, I wonder? Like for instance, ""Hey guys this is just too terrible for us to make! Lets do a rewrite, lets make it funny or poignant or insightful or you know... good."" Im sure I know why not, they were all concentrating on their next projects, no one had any heart or hope or mind in this one, they were all shruggin it off and taking their paychecks and moving on to better things. The lack of caring is obvious, numbing and deadly. The laughs in this movie are half laughs, the ideas are half thoughts, the emotions half felt and badly spoken. That Google would have had even the slightest connection to this wasteland is only more disappointing. I kept waiting for some of the energy and creativity of similar classic ""bad boys take over"" movies like Mash or Animal House or even Caddy Shack to show up, but no, someone has to care to accomplish that, someone has to at least try. In the middle of this dreary slog the two older louts take the brilliant but geeky kids from Google out to a hideous and slimy strip club where they get toxicly drunk, listen to truly obscene music, have a brawl, and wind up vomiting in a public park at dawn. They then righteously demand of the students, ""Wasnt that the best night of your life?"" And they are not kidding. It would have been so much better if they were.",The Internship

Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson clearly are a good comedic duo. The movie itself had good laughs along with a good message. But like most movies it definitely had it's downs. The first I think would be the supporting actors (especially the ones in the group) seemed to be trying a little to hard. They gave some laughs but a lot of the times it was obvious they were trying to hard to deliver and keep up with Vaughn and Owens. The other big negative this movie had going was the pg-13 rating. I understand making it more appealing to a broader audience, but it was borderline R anyways, might as well make the best of it and deliver harder laughs. Last but not least, and I really don't like when they do this, but a good portion of the laughs were seen on the trailers for the movie itself.

I mean, who doesn't? you get free food and it's fun. Even me, who isn't really into this technology thingy, wants to be part of it.Same with other films, The Internship also has that Cliché friendship which is very predictable.

There are no quirky jokes in this movie like wedding crashers but some great moments. If you are expecting Wedding Crashers, just don't.This is a feel good movie. And is actually set in a slightly fictionalized version of one of the most well know company in the world ""Google"". The story is of two 40 something guys who just lost their jobs, hunting for a new one and end up getting into one of the internship program at Google. The way their character arcs grow during the entire length of the movie is of sole importance. Also, here comedy is just the byproduct. You might not get a laugh but will definitely get to learn a lot of life lessons in a lighthearted way.The set designs and Google's campus environment is so on point in here. They also nailed the work culture of most of the tech companies. Also the portrayal of interns is so relatable. And 40 something people do find it difficult to get their desired job, especially someone who has a lot of experience and that is how it is portrayed in this movie, albeit with some modifications, for comedy purpose.The thing is, when it came out, people either perceived it as an advertisement for Google (I don't know why people creep out when a movie shows an actual company, like for god sake, in real world, people do work in these companies and most of them are actually happy to work there) or wrongly compared with Wedding Crashers.

Anyhow, I finally watched it tonight...and what I did not understand is the cause of its underrating despite it being such an amazing movie!!How many people in today's digital world actually dare to dream big and how many of them actually go chasing them?? Few...very few apparently!! In this movie, the two friends Nick and Billy, two failed salesmen, dream of working for Google and fighting all odds they go down to chase it. Its not important whether they get the job or not, what's important is their belief in themselves and their perseverance to accomplish their goal despite being despised by everyone...what's important is the team spirit which they so beautifully displayed and thus lessened the cynicism amongst the team!!Many reviews say that the plot line is predictable...well it is meant to be predictable to enhance the beliefs among the viewers!! In the movie there is a dialogue which struck me incredibly, ""There are still some dreams floating around out there, you just got to reach out and grab them""...and times will be there when u fall real hard chasing them, but you have to get right up and fight to own them as if it is just meant to be!!I say this is a very inspirational movie and it deserves much more accolades than what it has received!!

They eventually lose their jobs but in the end both agree to embark on a mission together in California; Take part of an ""Internship"" at Microsoft giant Google, a kind of trial period that if it goes well will lead to a full time occupation. Owen and Vince coordinate perfectly with each other in the picture, they have a great understanding and its safe to say that they carry the weight of the entire movie on their shoulders. The supporting cast is rather weak and offer very little or nothing, the romance story between Owen and the Australian girl seems quite wooden and not that much engaging and a few dull sequences in the middle of the movie quite repetitive could of had a better look at.The film works, the protagonists save it from being a forgettable one. It's worth a look because its offers the viewer an insight in the Google world "" full of pathetic -know it all Nerds"" , how it all functions and not many movies talk about the subject, so it's something different I suppose. It's not as good as wedding crashers but if you consider it an advert for Google and like the partnership Wilson-Vaugh then it can be enjoyable.My vote 6/10",The Internship
170,mygunyourhead613,Excuse me so I can go laugh my butt off!,7,11 June 2013,"When I first saw the preview of ""The Internship"", I thought nothing but a cheap comedy with cheap laughs (it didn't stood out or anything to me), I was just ready for that preview to be over and giggle away at Alan in ""The Hangover 3"". But after watching ""The Internship"" not long ago, it's obvious that the preview was presented wrongly, and the phrase ""don't judge a movie by it's trailer"" applied here, as it had me giggling away from the VERY first few minutes! At first, automatically, I saw Owen Wilson and Matthew Vaughn and thought John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey, but Nick and Billy's character in ""The Internship"" presented a whole new issue, and that was the unemployment issue. Though they don't address it directly, through their comedic ways, Billy and Nick present, as expressed through their Google internship online interview in a blender metaphor, that ""it's not so much getting out of the blender, it's what happens next. That's the question."" Being stuck in the blender, like being stuck in a seemingly never-ending cycle of unemployment, with enough creativity and motivation, you CAN get out of it, but what matters is if you KEEP using that same motivation and originality that makes you stand out EVEN after you've escaped that blender of unemployment, because that's what makes you grow as a person...it's not just escaping and then stopping, it's about KEEP GOING ON. And that's what Billy and Nick proved, though with their 70's references that not any of the college younglings understood. What ""doesn't kill you make you stronger"", and that's what learning to escape that blender, and look for another open door did for Nick and Billy, and well...learning teamwork, how to play Muggle Quidditch, and standing up against and beating Graham (not to mention, SWEEEEEEEET!). Though some scenes and happenings were a tad TOO obvious (Owen Wilson's character, Nick Campbell, getting with the ""always busy"" woman Dana; Nick and Billy beating Graham),and it was a lot of giggles (nothing bad with it), a comedy can STILL carry a message, and this movie's message, the idea to escape the blender (LAST TIME I bring up the ""blender"" metaphor, I pinky promise!) and keep fighting and make something for yourself, it IS still conveyed through the MANY laughs and silly things that these silly 40 year-olds do! I honestly DO recommend it!",The Internship
171,amsby17,We Love You Vince and Owen But This Misses the Mark,5,7 September 2014,"Be warned: movie goers should only watch the The Internship for one reason - to see their old friends again, Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. Only devote fans who have followed their work since comedic masterpieces like Old School and The Royal Tenebaums will forgive this movie's trite jokes and lame supporting cast. Vaughn serves as writer and producer for The Internship, unfortunately exposing his professional inabilities outside of comedy. Let's not also forget to mention The Internship's terrible cinematographer Jonathan Brown. Thanks to Brown, audiences can actually see Wilson's make-up - such a gross oversight is truly shocking. How does that happen? A list of Brown's other accomplishments might give some insight. His body of work includes: Pink Panther, Cheaper by the Dozen, and Just Married to name a few. The Internship does have some heart though and viewers will find themselves rooting for the likable underdogs as they work to defy the odds at Google.Billy (Vaughn) and Nick (Wilson) are great salesmen and in the world of The Internship salesmen are apparently a dying breed. With nothing left to lose, the two charm their way into unpaid positions at Google. It is interesting to see the corporate headquarters of Google and viewers get to have an inside look at the way the company operates - including nap pods and free food for employees. Stuck with a team of other misfits, Nick and Billy work their way through a series of competitive challenges. The winners of which will all receive full-time jobs at the company. Natural father figures Billy and Nick show their value to the team and as a collaborative unit they move through the series of silly games bonded together. The movie does try to be fun and lighthearted and truly succeeds at making Google look like a great place to work.There were so many holes and irrelevant plot points in this story - but in comedy that really shouldn't matter. If the jokes are funny enough viewers will forgive. This flick straddles the fence between too many movie mistakes and humor. It's really left up to each viewer's level of affection for Wilson and Vaughn that will decide whether they will hate The Internship or love it. One line did live up to Wilson's previous genius, ""No one ever said a shot of tequila was the journey to self respect...so...cheers!""",The Internship

So now we have The Internship which is Google, Google, Google, but without the story, insight, wit, acting, relevance, or plausibility of The Social Network.I loved Wedding Crashers so it's good to see Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson together again, and, of course, they do manage a few jokes. But, overall, it's a disappointing, implausible and largely-unfunny 2-hour infomercial for Google, its fabulous Googleplex HQ, and its ubiquitous products.If that appeals, then, hey, knock yerself out... but don't say I didn't warn ya.",The Internship
173,samfran94,Laugh Out Loud Summer Comedy - Don't Believe Me? ... Google it!,8,16 July 2013,"Many will see the title of my review and disagree, but in my opinion 'The Internship' has to be taken on its own terms. People who were disappointed with this movie were obviously expecting something different to what I was, I entered the cinema expected to have a good old chuckle with my friends at a hilarious summer comedy that showcased some of the brilliant chemistry we saw between Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson in 'Wedding Crashers'. I got all of this in abundance and left satisfied . . . and still laughing.This movie does exactly what it says on the tin, it's not trying to fool anyone it establishes itself a comedy and hammers home its genre in stunning fashion. I'm a big fan of both Vaughn and Wilson, admiring both of their incredible comedic talents. Especially Vaughn this time for writing the story and screen play of such a humorous movie.This time around we see the hapless duo as down on their luck salesmen who with the last throw of the dice apply for an internship at Google. There's just one problem, to say they are newcomers to technology would be an understatement, and thus the hilarity ensues.The film becomes a clash of culture in an almost 'Big Bang Theory' like set-up when Billy (Vaughn) and Micky (Wilson) who have seen a lot in their lives come up against the fresh faced generation whose obsession with work has seen them miss out on the funnier side of their youth, something which Billy and Micky then aim to correct. This gives the film somewhat of a charm and sensitivity as the two guys mould and look out their new team played by Josh Brener, Dylan O'Brien, Tiya Sircar and Tobit Raphael, all of whom impressed me with their comedic acting as they come up against villain of the piece Graham (Max Minghella), who looks to throw a spanner in the works.There are some wonderful fleeting appearances by John Goodman, Will Ferrell and Rob Riggle which add to the film's character, and Rose Byrne simply dazzles as Micky's gorgeous, ""no time for boyfriends"", love interest Dana which simply adds even more warmth and humour to an already solid movie, filled to the brim with hilarious scenes and pop- culture references (including a Quidditch match, and a Hangover-esque night out! Don't worry I'll say no more.)Overall I loved this movie, and for those who disagree with me I will simply say that you need to cheer up a bit! This movie should be enjoyed by all - it's light hearted, has a great cast and some side-splitting scenes and after seeing it I just hope that Vaughn and Wilson will choose to work together again in the future!",The Internship
174,easeltine,This is a Raunchy Comedy,4,31 July 2013,"There were many funny lines in this movie. The two main characters were funny. After having said that I am going to give you our problem with the movie.This is a real warning for you parents out there, especially parents that have a sense of morality, or are Christians that like to make sure the movies are appropriate before going to see them. You will not know about the aspect by just seeing the trailer. This movie assuredly deserves an ""R"" rating in our opinion. There is a part in this movie where they go into a pole dance club. This part is filled with inappropriate scenes and raunchy jokes. There is filthy humor were a home schooled kid is totally drunk and is cleaning off his underwear with the raunchy comedian Owen Wilson due to having masturbated with the dancers, several times. The scene is funny for the people in the world - if you know what I mean. Sometimes a person could rent a movie and fast forward over the bad sequences, but in my opinion this movie goes over the top. I will not allow it in my home. The entire part just dragged out for us. The world makes this movie a PG-13, (and feels proud about it), because there is little violence, (except the raunchy punch in the groin episodes), and there are only a handful of swear words. Someone teenager is going to read this and want to go to the movie after my review. The jokes are pretty funny. You will probably like the movie...but we didn't like it overall.",The Internship
175,filmtrance,Not Vaughn & Wilson's best work together by a long stretch.,4,29 July 2013,"Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson have starred together in classic comedies such as Starsky and Hutch and Wedding Crashers. Director Shawn Levy has reunited them again in the latest American comedy The Internship which centres around two salesmen (Vaughn and Wilson) whose careers have been torpedoed by the digital age. Through enrolling at a University, they find their way into an internship opportunity at Google where they must compete against some of the brightest young students in the country in order to get a shot at employment.The Internship's running time is 119 minutes and it ran in 3 stages. The first half an hour struggled to get you engaged in the film or the characters at all and was lacking the crucial element: comedy. Even a cameo appearance from the brilliant Will Ferrell was just a desperate attempt to get a laugh but the scenarios just didn't work. The second stage is where the film picks up some credibility as you do begin to get into the story and the tempo picks up along with the humour. It's typical Vince Vaughn comedy when he's picking apart the head of the Internship program Mr Chetty (Aasif Mandvi) or interacting with his designated group to complete the assignments that are all social outcasts yet, ironically, have an unbelievable night out filled with hilarious antics. Owen Wilson, meanwhile, is trying to woo executive Dana (Rose Byrne) in his usual charming ways. Unfortunately though the comedy doesn't last and we are back to a slow, dragged out finish.Certain characters in The Internship are spot on however in how society works today. The group consisting of our two main stars also has an Asian American named Yo-Yo who is home-schooled by an overbearing mother, an Indian girl called Neha who is into nerd related fantasies (and that's all they are), Stuart who is just constantly on his phone and rarely speaks and the team leader Lyle who overcompensates for his insecurities by trying to act hip and cool.Yet again another reasonable idea for a comedy but it falls miserably short of the classics that we all love. The incredibly complex industry that is Google offers too much of a formulaic script for Vaughn and Wilson to thrive.",The Internship
176,jaythejza,A slow burning feel good comedy movie,6,2 July 2013,"A bit of a slow burner, but stick with it & the laughs get better. There is an entertaining story to this movie, where two salesmen lose their jobs & stumble upon a break as interns for Google. The movie follows there interesting journey learning to keep up with modern ways & puts across the important message that being a people person is important in business & in life, something that modern culture & technology can sometimes forget.It does take a while before the jokes start getting funny, I did find myself thinking after the first half hour that it was going to be a dull movie, with tired jokes & the usual format for these type of comedies, but it does pick up its game.The characters in the movie were entertaining & played their parts well, a group of your typical outcasts & misfits coming together as a team gave the movie a good feel good factor as well as plenty laughs. I didn't find myself laughing out loud more than a couple of occasions, but it was funny & entertaining. Josh Brener as Lyle stood out well having the cool nerdy geek thing down to a T! Although the movie does look like a massive Google advert, its not as bad as say ""The Watch"" with all its Costco adverts, that movie wouldn't have been any different without it, where as there was more of a point to the tie in with this. That said, you do wonder what was thought of first, a movie about a couple of guys down on their luck to find a break as interns at a huge company, or lets make a Google movie & build the story around that?",The Internship

What's the catch? They have to compete with hundreds of young, tech-savvy, genius geek in a summer internship program at Googleplex.Review: With Google and Googleplex at the core of this movie, you can expect a lot of product advertisement here and there. Everything was super colourful, high-tech and awesome! I do not know how true some of the facilities at the Google Headquarters are (sleeping pod, free-for- all cafeteria etc.), but they do make everyone believes that Google is the best place to work in the entire world!Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson portrayed the old-school, tech illiterate salesmen Billy and Nick pretty convincing here. Their combination was as good (if not better) as their previous movie, Wedding Crashers. The supporting actors/actresses, Josh Brenner, Dylan O'Brien, Tiya Sircar and Tobit Raphael also slot in excellently as team members with both Billy and Nick. Max Minghella who played as the irritating rival to Billy and Nick could do better hadn't he overused his British accent annoyingly. Rose Bryne, who acts as the romantic partner for Nick, was underutilized, and so is Aasif Mandvi as the Head of Internship Program.However, the most surprising part is the storyline. This movie is about unlikely relationships, current job struggles, coming-of-age issues, and generation differences. Yes, an internship is involved, but there is more to this movie than the title presents. I loved the relationships between Vaughn and Wilson and their team of college students; I felt the characters were relatable and presented realistic problems.In conclusion, this is not the funniest movie around. If you dislike the fast-talking, witty humor of Vaughn paired with Wilson, this may not be the movie for you. They even quote a lot of vague 80's reference which young generation won't be able to relate to. However, having said that, The Internship is still a fun movie to watch, because it does not only give you humor, but also feed you with friendship values, the importance of teamwork, managing differences and other bit and pieces along the way.Final Verdict: 6.5/10. Not the funniest movie around, but fun nonetheless. Highly recommended if you want to take a sneak peak at Googleplex and some of its cool features, and if you love Vaughn-Wilson combination.",The Internship

In ""The Internship"" they play middle-aged salesmen who suddenly decide old dogs can learn new tricks, but apart from a few geek jokes the gags just don't hit their mark.

And by badly made I mean everything (from storyline to characters, to lousy cutting andsoonandsoforth). But I guess all the money went to owen Wilson and this other guy whose name I have gladfully erased from my mind after this debacle.Sorry, I usually enjoy the good ol' feel good comedy, just like I have enjoyed Wedding Crashers and the likes. Because they were actually funny and witty, and this crap is just not. Well no, actually I'm not really sorry. It just makes me angry and sad.Even if this hadn't been a two hour long in-your-face-until-your-eyes-and-ears-bleed commercial (please god let me never hear the term ""googliness"" again) about google - which by itself was extremely irritating - it would have still been an awful film.Oh, and to everyone who gave 4 or more stars: google may be paying you now, but don't be surprised if they take your soul later.This is not a good look for IMDb either I must say, which is quite frustrating.

It's one of those films to see either on an afternoon when nothing else is happening or as a Sunday evening TV film. I would have liked to see more of John Goodman character to counter the sweetness of the rest of the film.I got a little confused as I thought his character had retired to Florida so when Vince Vaughn left Google to join him to sell mobility scooters and Owen Wilson went after him, he tracked him down in an hour as they were in California ......4000 miles away from John Goodman .....did I miss something along the way?

Trouble is that neither of them is cool nor funny. To be honest I am kind of embarrassed by their acting. its the same acting they do in every movie. Same character and same whinny voices and familiar clumsiness. it was nice in the ""the wedding crushers"" but thats about it. so what is the message here? that google is great place to work? that if you are over 40 you can still go and pick on 20+ kids and while doing it get a dream job in Cillicon valley?",The Internship

However, in this film, Vince Vaughn just rambles on and on in quite a few scenes taking a whimsical moment into an irritating rant. The plot was good, but the story is completely predictable. The other supporting actors and actresses played great parts, but after I finished watching this, I had the ""I paid to see this"" blues. I was pleased with Owen Wilson's performance as usual, but the director &/or writer just made Vince Vaughn into a dunce.

But no, nothing. There are some moments where I was like ""Are they seriously doing this movie?"", because I find those scenes just too absurd. The acting is terrible, plus a weak plot and very predictable ending. In specific, the movie is about two guys who, by luck, got an internship in Google. It's great to see Google from the inside and see how amazing an internship there is, but it hurts to watch the movie, seriously. The story just makes no sense. It's too ideal and unrealistic. Like, one day you are a loser, you try your best and become a winner. The good thrives and the bad demises. It's like a kid story, which is presented in a very uncomfortable way.The acting is the most disappointing to me. After Midnight in Paris I never expect to see Owen Wilson in a movie like this. Other supporting characters are weak and terrible also.The movie can be fun and entertaining, possibly. But to me it's a waste of time.

192,snowybird,It sucks! On the bright side though.... wait there isn't one,2,29 May 2015,"This movie was truly a test of endurance. The main actors can barely act and the comedy clichés and tired tripe kick in immediately. Other than perhaps the core idea of ""The Internship"" nothing is original whatsoever. Every single character is just annoying beyond belief and the greatest challenge of the movie is standing more than one scene starring these unbearable characters. The """"""comedy"""""" of the movie is largely about character interaction to its credit but it's basically the same setup every time. I'll show you:-People doing stuff -Main character (typically Vaughn) doesn't understand jack and makes useless comment -Main characters start rambling annoyingly while other characters try to shut them up -Something FINALLY happens and main characters either stop or get out of the sceneThis goes on for what seems like an eternity but the movie has this air of smugness to it like it really loves itself and thinks itself funny as hell that I could not stand. (SPOILERS AHEAD) (Skip to conclusion if you don't wanna read any)The story is pretty straightforward; two guys lose their job and get an internship at Google where they have to go through a series of team based challenges with a cast of colorful, quirky and lovable characters! There is Awkward Spice, Slutty Spice, Asian Spice and all the other tired stereotypes that'll make you want to break your skull with a pneumatic drill. They perform poorly but through the out-of-the-box thinking of our main characters they start pulling through and in the dumbest climax I've ever seen in my life they get jobs at Google. I don't want to completely ruin it for you but it involves pizzas, the worst twist since ""Signs"" and all the very worst comedy the movie has to offer. Ultimately this product placement film falls short in all categories ever and should only be viewed by people who genuinely believe Happy Madison are the kings of good comedy and Adam Sandler is a comedic god (I believe the technical term is ""Idiots""). The only redeeming quality is that it isn't as bad as ""Garbage Pail Kids"" though it's too close for comfort. It's seriously the worst comedy I've seen in a good while.2/10 Pure garbage",The Internship

The storyline was .... annoying and condescending.Every year the best and the brightest .. nerds... from all over the world compete to get into the coveted internship at google. Only the best nerds make it. Most do not. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaugh are two washed out jocks who peaked early. They are unemployed salesmen who seem to have no future, coz the world has changed. Now geeks rule the world. They decide to interview for the internship and despite performing terribly in the interview, google inexplicably picks them because ... errr ... they are different (presumably from the nerds who work there. Duh?!).Till this point, the story had potential to either be great.... or ... bad. Unfortunately, instead of something meaningful where the adults, through their real life experiences, adds something of value to the lives of the young geeks, the movie inexplicably becomes a story about how a bunch of washed out, unemployed jocks have to teach geeks how to enjoy life and become free by, get this - taking them to a strip club for a drunken night of debauchery ... and checking out some naked ladies. If only things were so easy in life.Being a geek myself, I find it offensive that jocks think we do not know how to find a strip club on our own. This movie would've been funny in the 90s. Now it is just weird... and ... stupid.Sure, there were some early chuckles, but pretty soon it turns bizarre and boring. A few times, I found myself checking my wrist - and wishing I had a watch to see the passage of time - from the bygone era where this movie firmly belongs.SGB",The Internship

The message was a bit cliché and idealistic, but the inspiration throughout this movie can really be felt. The acting was well done and really did portray the youth of this generation and the troubles it faces quite accurately. The plot was somewhat predictable, but that is excusable considering the quality of the acting and the meaning behind the entire story. Moreover, being a Google user, I found this especially interesting.I give this movie a seven-star rating out of ten because watching it at the movies was not a regrettable experience and if this were to spontaneously come on the television, I liked ""The Internship"" enough that I would watch it again.

I say that as someone who enjoyed Swingers then saw his career careen into roles where he is essentially the same guy, almost like he is here. Then on a flight overseas I had this as an option and decided to watch it. I went into it thinking it would suck and maybe it was altitude, small screen, whatever but my first view confirmed what I thought. Then a few months later it started running on HBO and I took another look. It takes a big man to admit when he is wrong and I certainly was in this case. Dare I say it I really enjoyed VV in this movie and Owen Wilson is always good, again essentially the same character he has played his whole career. What makes it for me is the interaction with the other interns and the overall supporting cast. From the overconfident and spoiled intern nemesis on another team, to the head of Intern program, and the kids themselves. For some reason after another look it really all works. There are some parts of the plot that really do not help drive the story but they are easy to overlook and forgive the director for. I am one movie buff who can admit when predisposition and general dislike for an actor skewed my view of a movie, and can admit I was wrong. Give this movie a shot. I still am not a fan of VV's other movies but seeing as he does claim Chicago as home and I am born and raised here, I will give him a pass.",The Internship

After this happens, I have found myself promising that never again will I not watch a film that I like the look of, based on reviews criticising it. Yet, time after time, I end up believing that, if a movie received as little as 36 per cent on Rotten Tomatoes, it must be bad. I keep falling back into that trap. Never again.Having watched the Internship, after having anticipated it and followed it, I can say that I will never again judge a movie by its reviews. Every single one that I read gave it poor to Luke-warm ratings. For me though, this was an incredibly funny and highly topical movie. Sure, it ended up being a giant commercial for Google (one that paints them in an very, very good light), but I found it inspiring and emotional. How often have you been confronted with the option to step into the unknown? To leave your security to face the possibility of true happiness, but with the danger of bottomless despair. For some, this is not a huge deal, it won't resonate. For me, though, this message with as potent as I have seen. I'm intentionally keeping this spoiler free, so I will just say this. I love Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn (and Ben Stiller with the rest of the Frat Pack), and this being their first movie together since Wedding Crashers, there was a little expectation.

My only criticism is I would not want to watch again - would wait a while until forgot most of the events - as the humour loses its touch when used more than once.

Google's driver-less car along with the Space Ship One at the entrance makes the movie look more like an ad for Google (the rest of the movie makes you feel that this is not necessarily a bad thing).But, filled with poor writing it quickly degrades in quality with some very poor characters taking up most of the screen-time. The characters are so gimmicky and caricatured that the movie loses any sense of realism it held.

I liked the underlying conflict of humanity vs. technology, and the subplot of this conflict's implications on modern culture was used as a vehicle for establishing a connection to the audience and creating some amusing situations. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson were both funny and likable in this film and they left you with a warm and hopeful feeling at the conclusion.

You get ""The Internship"" starring Vince Vaughn as Billy McMahon and Owen Wilson as Nick Campbell.No plot summary is truly necessary for this movie. It is as advertised. ""The Internship"" follows two old school salesmen, Billy McMahon (Vaughn) and Nick Campbell (Wilson) as they go from selling high-end watches in bulk to retail stores, to trying to fit in among twenty-something interns at Google headquarters. As per usual with underdog comedies, the two are grouped with interns whom are considered to be the misfits of the crop, and then do their best using their salesmen skills to bring to group to cohesiveness. Along the way, Nick becomes attracted to an executive already with Google, and Billy has to learn to cope with his inability to learn new age technology.This is a funny movie, not unlike ""Wedding Crashers,"" except that in ""The Internship"" the plot certainly has room for improvement. One thing is clear however. Whether it takes a movie like ""The Internship"" or one like ""Anchorman"" (a bit more crude), Vaughn and Wilson are still able to brings laughs on to the big screen, no matter how cheap they might be.

In my opinion The Internship is a way different and a way better movie than the Wedding Crashers. This is a feel good movie with humor, which has a message. It is for the teenagers who have no idea what to do with their lives, it's for the people in their twenties who are are wondering if they are in the right path, it's for the people in their thirties and forties who feel like the world is evolving and their lives to getting out of their hands. It is basically a movie for everyone who wants to feel good and light, not just laugh at mindless jokes. Okay, I might have made it sound like a serious film. It's not. It's one of those movies that will make you laugh and lift you up, when you're feeling down. One of my favorites, for sure!",The Internship
221,zerkoto,Very nice and funny movie,9,30 June 2013,"I really enjoyed watching it. It's a very nice comedy with two of my favorite actors :D. i also loved the many link-ups with other movies, books, etc (especially at the end with game of thrones :D). Excellent story, background and characters. The whole action and the movie as a whole was simply awesome with very nice details. One of the funniest comedies this year. Relaxing and motivating movie which may really cheer you up after having a bad day and actually be good enough to motivate you with either your job or ambitions. Shows that nothing is impossible if you try hard enough to succeed. A thing that i didn't like very much was the ""geek"" references because i think that someone could get offended in some way but they were not so direct, so i guess that's not even a negative point about the movie. Actually I really can't think of anything negative about the movie at all. It was a pleasure watching it and i highly recommend it to everybody who likes good now-a-days comedies.",The Internship
222,wolfrainrules,OK but insults the people working at Google,3,21 June 2013,When I first heard of the movie I thought that of how funny this movie could be. I was a bit disappointed on how much this movie didn't made fun of their own audience. Spoiler: The two main characters used old stories to get the buyers to get their products at the interview for the job. Once they are at Google the internet company decides to spit up everyone into small teams in order to see their strengths and weaknesses and how they can make the company better. The two main characters decide to give their so call team a horrible time by ruining three challenges (Oh by the way there is only 5 challenges. The team manage to win one challenge and at the last minute got the last challenge. The Google company decides that instead of picking the winning team (that had three challenges won) they choose the team that literately goofed off and give them the full time job with Google. In the end I didn't liked the fact that it just made fun of the audience by telling them that even though the true hard working citizens apply to a job then it would most likely be given to the jerks who are acting like Homer Simpson. I recommend to not go and see this movie.,The Internship
223,Yellolo,Easy Watch,6,4 November 2013,"I watched this film on a rainy Sunday afternoon and I'm fairly glad I did. This is an easy watch; light hearted with some good jokes here and there but by no means the film you want to watch if you're looking for something more complex. The good points were a lot of the supporting cast like Josh Brener who played Lyle, Dylan O' Brien as Stuart and Tiya Sircar as Neha and the running jokes like 'on the line' however this did get a little predictable towards the end and seemed to fall into the trap that all Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn films seem to fall in; the oh so cheesy ending. Other things that I didn't like was the side story of Nick(Owen Wilson) and Dana which again was so predictable and I knew from the first moment that they were gonna get together (also Owen Wilson's cringey flirting) and Max Minghella as Graham who was really unconvincing and stereotypical in his portrayal of the character.",The Internship

Well, it did.

The movie has a good message and it was fun seeing the Google campus.Most the cast did a pretty good job. Though the one kid was kind of annoying. Though that may have been the point.

Actually, when I was going through the Redbox selection and saw it had Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn in it, I picked it immediately and didn't even read the plot summary. It was reminiscent of Wedding Crashers but a little more up to date and with funnier scenes. I laughed out loud throughout a lot of it. I think the funniest aspect was Wilson and Vaughn's characters relation to technology. As to be expected, product placement was prominent but it is worth it since it was filmed in the U.S. and not overseas. Definitely a great comedy overall, in my opinion, although more scenes with Will Ferrell in it would have made it perfect. :)",The Internship

I saw an advanced screening in Chicago a couple weeks ago and the entire audience was cracking up the entire time. Even the romantic scenes are funny in this movie, and thats kind of rare. Also I'm sick of people giving it negative reviews just because it's at Google, or it's a Google commercial. As if Google is really hungry for people to come do their internships. Obviously they're getting the best minds in the whole world to come there already. I'm sure everybody knows what the heck Google is.Go see it, it's worth the price of admission. Vaughn and Wilson are great together...feels like a Wedding Crashers sequel of sorts with the way the two characters interact with each other...and of course a perfect cameo early on was hilarious.",The Internship

233,pynchme,This movie surprised me.,9,16 February 2014,"I only watched it because it had Vince Vaughn in it and he is usually entertaining. However, what a lovely surprise. I know the plot is a bit of a soft version of fish out of water but the characterizations themselves and interest in Google happenings was enough to hold it together. One thing I found a bit puzzling was that during orientation, the interns are told that they aren't allowed to date other employees. Next thing Owen Wilson is hitting on his love interest who is positioned as an experienced Google employee. Maybe I missed something there; but I'll pay closer attention next time I watch it to see if I misunderstood something there. I didn't find the love match convincing but it was such a small side line in the movie that it didn't matter. One other little issue for me was the incredible ageism. In fact, it was a bit of a stretch of believability that a couple of blokes in their 30s or 40s wouldn't be tech savvy nowadays. However, to the ageism - is that fair dink? Does Google really not understand it's demographic? - ageing populations everywhere people! Being youthful doesn't automatically equate to the best ideas or social knowledge. Well having said that, I would say that Google really doesn't understand the public it serves. It's a great search service but otherwise it demolishes the usability of everything else it touches. Maybe Google really should hire more mature aged people. Anyway, I thought it was great. It's really nice to watch something that is borderline wholesome at least! Fun and funny movie - interesting as well, which is a bonus.",The Internship

Also the main actors are like contemporary Walter Matthew and Jack Lemmon. The dialogs are very smart, crisp and up to point, with lot of side references from different generations (depending who is using them). Also the short episodes by Will Farrell and John Goodman are brilliant. The story is working and it is actually making fun of the ""american dream"" but by over-exaggerating it. A double sarcasm so to say. All the characters are clichés, but the perfect ones. Fine tuned comedy at its best. The movie just flows and the time in cinema is flying by.

That's like saying Caddy shack or Home Alone wasn't deep enough so 5 stars. Sometime the movie is just fun and light. And that's alright. Also, saying that this movie is just product placement for Google is stupid. I got to this website using Google.

But since they are both so dinosaur in many ways, it seems hard to find a new job that requires zero to none computing skills. Despite the hurdle, Billy managed to convince Nick to join Google's summer internship program. That is possibly one of the worst suggestion anyone could ever make. Having to fight with thousands of fine young graduates, they actually managed to get into their program. But this doesn't mean they are hired. It's only an internship program. The movie gets fun when they reach Googleplex. They will have to form teams and compete to get the top spot to have a chance to be employed.The Film The movie didn't start off with a bang. It actually went quite slowly for the first 30 minutes. But the build up of the movie was there. It slowly reels you in with all the witty jokes and odd scenes. It gets fun when they finally reach Googleplex. This is where you'll see some Google cultures, but it does make you wonder if everything that was shown in the movie is actually part of the real internship program. It does have quite a number of odd sayings and doings. This movie is a feel good movie. It's the kind of movie where you'll see a team formed with a bunch of people who are the outcast or last picked. But somehow this team would rise from the ashes and carry the last member across the finishing line and still magically win the whole game despite pitting against the best of the best teams that is almost guaranteed to win. Great movie overall. Jokes that require a bit of thinking instead of being slap stick. Good build up of story line instead of being predictable.

You know from the very first start who is sponsoring the movie and all along you will wish that you could send an application to work for google (there must be a subliminal message hidden).

Barely a laugh in sight at the cinema. Cannot believe Google signed this off – they have self-belief in spades! Things that did make a mark on me in this film: Google provides silly hats for interns (i.e. ""Noogles"", porting silly little hats complete with little propellers), coloured bicycles on campus, relaxation pods, online advertising, online analytics, GPS location services, oh and not forgetting free food (provided not taken home, and a barrel of laughs intended to be associated around this one).

242,z_imdb-28,Another Good Reason to Uninstall and Dump Everything Google,1,28 January 2014,"I was told to watch this film by a friend and after about 10 minutes I realized he used my own gag on me; yes, I have fun recommending awful movies!My 1st thought prior to watching was that Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are washed up, everything I've seen in the last five years from them has been mostly garbage, unoriginal and simply not funny but what the heck, give this one a try, wish I hadn't!Google must have been involved in this film from the 1st scene as it really is just a horribly long commercial that I paid to watch. As others have said, it's an ad and not a funny one.While I may have a predisposition to not liking a film about how great Google is, because I think they suck, mostly because of anti privacy, low quality products, cocky attitude and hugely successful for God knows what reason, I did not let my attitude towards Google interfere, in fact I almost felt embarrassed for them having their name all over such a bad film. But, in the end, the film matched how I feel about this over glorified company and I feel bad for Wilson and Vaughn being suckered into such a bad script.Basically, this film suffers for the same reason that too many Hollywood films suffer from today: NO SCRIPT! It's apparent that the dialog was made up on the fly, letting actors craft what they think is funny in a strange, almost insulting and vastly unsatisfying manor. There really is no chemistry between anyone in this film. The pathetic love story between Wilson and the Aussie, and all the love tales found in this film are not only empty but so bad you can see it in the actors eyes. Few actors are good enough to not reveal, thru their eyes and expressions, their own dissatisfaction with the role they've found themselves in and there are no good actors in this film. Even Will Ferrell's cameo is not funny.Don't see it, but if you do, don't pay for it! And to those involved in promoting this film giving it high rankings on IMDb, SHAME ON YOU!

The basic story is that Wilson & Vaughn are the best salesmen of their time, but everything is computerized now. I like the line in which their boss says ""Your dinosaurs now"" this shows that they have no hope no matter what, but obviously because it's a movie so it's all very predictable.Later on, Billy (Vaughn) gets them an interview for an internship which could predict on weather they get the job. Now because they were born way before computers they have no idea what they're doing. When they arrive at Google Nick (Wilson) refers to the interns and the internship as a ""Mental Hunger Games against a bunch of genius kids."" Shortly after they arrive at Google they meet the ""Douche Bag"" who is Graham Hawtrey (Max Minghella) and almost straight away you can tell he is the ""Bad Guy"" of this film.Now here are the thing(s) I didn't like about this movie:I thought that the scene at the club was a bit too pro-longed for me. In most movies those kind-of scenes are tree minutes at most, but there were some good parts like the fighting bit, but it was too long for my personal liking. Also the producers made a similar mistake to ""TED"" they put all of the funny parts in the trailer! Yes I understand that you want to put more than one funny section to get them to definitely watch your movie, but you do not need to put all of them in the trailer, one of the biggest mistakes you can make when making a movie.My overall thoughts:My overall thoughts on this movie were good, it wasn't a film where you will do anything to avoid the film. If you haven't seen it already I suggest you go to watch it, if you don't want to wait for it to be on DVD just go onto Google and search ""Watch the Internship online free"" and i'm sure you'll find it.Have something to say?

247,OskarThysell,A bad touch experience with a dystopian core,1,21 April 2014,"My mother said to me this Friday: ""The companies are buying our culture from us"" after watching what we had assumed was a light-hearted comedy of little to no substance.'The Internship' is a 2 hour commercial where the main characters work to fulfill their dreams of being employed by Google. Movies as a propaganda tool is nothing new; it's no secret that the American army was in bed with Hollywood during the Second World War to produce movies to instill patriotism. This is something radically different though. This is not a commercial for a mindset, a belief or an idea. This is a commercial for a tangible, real company with stocks, shareholders and products. Let's not forget that these war propaganda movies have their counterarguments which show the horrors of war; in the genre of movies about Google there is one solitary voice: Working at Google is the most awesome job on Earth.We as consumers are now paying to see commercials. What pisses me off is that I, my mother and my brother had no idea what we were in for. We were unable to perform as educated consumers, unwillingly sacrificing our hard-earned cash and time from our private lives to be indoctrinated. Here I see the downside of living in a country where we don't examine or censor the movies we distribute; although the issue of sex and violence in movies and how that affects the fragile minds is not a cause I personally feel that strongly about, propaganda with very clear parameters is not something I want to have such widespread distribution and influence as a movie.Worst part is that I did not see the foulness completely at first. I left the cinema with a bad taste in my mouth from the blandness, the clichéd story and the blatant fact that Google had waved their gigantic wallet around to produce, promote and show this commercial at my local theater. Discussing the movie more, I remembered that since I've seen this movie a million times already I was filling in the blanks myself. The setting could have easily changed to a hockey team which is the underdogs, who are determined to win and that determination pays off in the end. I rooted and identified with the lovable losers and wanted them (me) to fulfill their dreams.

250,veronikazakonjsek,Film review from http://nickysfilmdiary.wordpress.com,2,3 November 2014,"Imagine that you are an unsuccessful, uneducated, 40-something man- child who doesn't know a thing about technology. And you were just let go from your job – from the only thing you were ever really good at. On top of all that the economy is bad, there are no jobs available and no one wants to hire a man in their 40's. Sounds bad, right? Not really, no. In a world of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson you have every chance of getting an internship – not just anywhere, but at Google! – and eventually even a job. Yes, let's keep the American Dream alive, people!I could go on forever about this ridiculous script. Another thing (besides the obvious message the film tries to deliver) that really bothered me was that almost all supporting characters were painfully stereotypic. We have an arrogant and pretentious British guy, so mean that he could easily be a long lost brother of Draco Malfoy. Then there's an Asian geek/mathematic genius with very strict and conservative parents who only care about his professional success and don't allow him any social life. There's also a gloomy, ""I'm so above you all"" hipster guy, because let's face it – we're in 2013 and it's hip to have a character like that (or at least that's probably what Vince Vaughn thought when he wrote this brilliant screenplay). And finally, there's a character of 30-something career woman who needs to find a man to complete her self-realization. And this man is, of course, no other than infantile, incompetent Owen Wilson.Anyhow, the main point of the film, hidden behind this badly written »comedy«, is to maintain the illusion of American Dream. There's one scene where the younger members of the Wilson/Vaughn team are worrying about their future – because no matter what schools you attend and how much time and effort you put into education, it is not guaranteed that you'll land a good job. American Dream is dead. But is it really? Wilson and Vaughn try to comfort the audience and show them that the American Dream is still very much alive. You don't need any education, any experience, you don't even have to know how to work with a computer to land a job at Google (or anywhere for that matter) and to turn your life around and start from scratch. No matter how old you are – everything is possible! If you're a middle-aged white male from a middle-class family, of course.",The Internship

Google, island, wedding, He is just standing there bubbling words making no sense and certainly no fun at all.",The Internship
255,modmaniac,Avoid this horrible ad campaign,1,4 October 2013,This is nothing more than a two minute ad stretched out to a full feature. Its so painfully obvious that it is nothing more than a ad campaign and not a serious movie. Although there is some funny moments in this its pretty clear that Owen is a bit short on cash and agrees to anything these days which is so sad because i really like him as an actor. But the way both him and Vince Vaughn is selling themselves short is horrible.My advise is to stay far away from this horrible corporate ad campaign. Shame on you Owen i thought that you had more integrity than this......This movie isn't really a movie its a painful advertisement Avoid it if you canI gave this a 1 out of 10 just because its an ad not a movie,The Internship

And it just got worse from there....oh so much worse. I really like movies in general if for nothing else than their storytelling aspect. So overall, I never have much bad to say about any of them with just a very few exceptions. This movie is absolutely one of those exceptions...or perhaps in a class of bad all by itself. This movie is easily the worst movie I've seen in maybe 30 years. And it's not a computer/tech thing. Actually I am familiar with Google and its history, and I have even written programs in the last year so I get it. This film is just terrible on so so many levels. Bad acting, bad script, bad story, unbelievable things happening...you name it. Do something more substantial with your 2 hours than watching this like watching paint dry.",The Internship
257,mariaritax,Don't waste your time watching it!,2,29 January 2014,"Some parts were funny - but not that funny! The film had good potentials but it stayed shallow. A bit sexist too. (spoiler) I didn't understand the strip club scene. What was that about? Neha is the only woman in the group, she has to use sexual innuendos to get acceptance in the group and she is also grateful to be taken to a strip club. She got a place at google, surely she is more clever than that! I don't think an intelligent, young woman would be happy to go a strip club, one of the most degrading place for a woman to be and were women archive the opposite she is trying to archive in her professional life. Also the guys in the group were shown as having a first taste of life. Is it in a strip club where you learn the joys of life if you are a little nerd?",The Internship
258,TabulaRasaBlue,A Feel Good Comedy with a Strong Team,8,8 June 2013,"Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson make a great team. Their chemistry and crazy dialogue make this movie work. Not only are they believable as smooth talkers who finagle their way into Google, they meet a team of young and ambitious college students who are delightfully strange in their own ways. As a comedy about salesmen trying to succeed in an environment that challenges them and seems improbable to talk their way out of, this movie is slightly contrived because -- well -- it's a movie. These are the parts worth watching. It's hilarious and worth your time if you're looking for a laugh.",The Internship

This movie surprised me as I was very reluctant to watch it. A quick look at the trailer , immediately I thought this was going to be a google advertisement (so what if it is a little bit) with a lot of silly jokes, maybe college parties and the like. This is no masterpiece of course and while I thought I would be bored to a coma, there was this unbelievable feel good - positive attitude that got to me. Truth be told I would rate this movie a 6 as a total but on account of the attitude and the life lessons I give it a 7. I think this is a relaxing movie to watch on a slow night when you want to unwind and maybe be motivated who knows.",The Internship

Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson give their samey performance as always which isn't necessarily a bad thing but could be improved. An interesting choice of cast made up of new starting actors and John Goodman briefly. It's very anti-climatic plot doesn't really lead anywhere as everyone knows what is going to happen in the end. It does leave you feeling in a good mood unless the extremely boring and cheesy ending ruins it for you.

Its like the script was written by two writers, one before ""the club"" and one after. The second writer went on a really strange sexual enlightenment and alcohol discovery rant in place of what could have been an opportunity to demonstrate the power of wisdom over the inexperience of youth, which, quite frankly I thought was the whole premise of the movie.",The Internship
262,dr-bartolo,"Funny buddy comedy meets ""Revenge of the Nerds""",7,14 December 2013,"I knew going into this that there would be a lot of things I've already seen in thousands of other comedies. If a formula works, why change it? And yet, Vaughn and Wilson make this somewhat predictable mash up of a buddy comedy meets ""Revenge of the Nerds"" work.Vaughn and Wilson have a chemistry on screen that makes me wonder why they waited so long to team up again after ""Wedding Crashers."" Each of them have very good comedic chops and timing, and together, the sum of the whole is greater than its parts. Their rhythm, timing and the way they play off each other comes through the screen and you just can't help but laugh. Add to that some nice supporting cast efforts and cameos by established Hollywood A-listers John Goodman and Will Ferrell and you've got a movie that is surprisingly good and funny despite knowing from the first minute of film how it's going to end. A few more scenes with Ferrell and Goodman would have been nice, particularly so with Goodman. He tells his best two salesmen, ""...you two were great salesmen. The best. But at the end of the day you're grinders, foot soldiers. We all know you'll never be generals. And I'm gonna say something harsh now. Strap it in boys 'cause it ain't pretty out there and you two are dinosaurs. Face it. Where you're going, you've already been."" Goodman hits all the right comedic spots and gets the message across loud and clear without beating us over the head with his message. He is the 'every man.""The movie really succeeds or fails though on the merits of Vaughn and Wilson. Luckily for us they are as good a comedy duo as there is working in Hollywood today. Two little extra bonuses: Aasif Mandvi, who plays Mr. Chetty, is absolutely hilarious as the ever serious, ""wet blanket"" Google executive and the Quidditch game (hysterical!).""The Internship"" has some adult content, like the scene in the strip club, and some adult language, but is still pretty family friendly and sends a nice message of going after your dreams with hard work and good old fashioned American know how.All in all, ""The Internship"" hits the right notes and delivers a nice couple of hours of easy to watch comedy.",The Internship

The movie was so bad, it actually hurt. I personally love the actors. They have played in some very good movies. The Wedding Crashers is really 10 times better than this. The story line was predictable, the jokes were old and cheesy. I literally did not laugh. I don't think I laughed even once. Some scenes were just weird and too long, others were too short. The direction was thus not flawless. I wish that I haven't watched this. This movie should be rated under a 5. Let's all vote 1 star to get this piece of cow pie down.

No I am not exaggerating, taking in to account the budget and the actors, the WORST movie I've seen since.....man this could be the worst movie I've ever seen.I felt like they weren't even trying, or were they trying too hard ? All I could think about was how awful and embarrassing it must have been for everyone involved to sit and watch this at the premiere.

Identity crisis even though they're actually talented: Check. Shoehorned pop culture references: Check. Eventual underdog success: CheckIf you haven't figured out already from the tag lines and promos and the title itself, the whole movie is about two losers who get hired at Google and then goof up everything. Ironically, for a movie that is basically a huge Google product-placement with a little movie and Harry Potter references thrown in, the movie depends almost entirely upon nerd stereotypes to try and elicit laughs (and fails miserably). How Google let its name be attached to this debacle is a mystery no one may ever solve. Watch this only if you're stoned and don't mind being bored out of your mind.",The Internship

It seems strange to watch a movie concerning Google, but the location and topic gives a lot of possibilities to make the movie interesting.Finally, the characters destroy the full movie. They show us an exaggerated stupidity and presumption that is very annoying. The character of Owen Wilson, Nick, begins during the movie to be an intellectual person, but Vince Vaughn alias Billy ruined every scene with his vulgarity.In my opinion, its okay to show us the characters as funny idiots, but with some coolness, and not like pubertal kids.",The Internship

The two underdogs with ambitious have to overcome a situation in their lives, but have hurdles in the way. The unlikely love interest that dislikes them at first ends up falling for them, and they achieve their goals. Complete with a generic snobby character, who is their opposing force...

To be blatantly honest, I saw the film mainly because Dylan O'Brien was in it. However,now that I've seen it, I would watch it again even if Dylan O'Brien weren't in it. It was humorous and I could connect with the nerd references in the film which I found to be very funny. More than it was funny, it was refreshing. The film felt modern and was spot on about society and how it works today. The settings themselves will have you in awe at just how cool they are. All the characters were lovable as well and strayed from what I had first expected in a good way. I mean, it was impossible to not connect with them, if not at least one. The film contained that basic underdog story line but the way they executed this story line was different and I appreciated it.

In movies, sometimes actors that have worked together in the past, work together again, and it doesn't mean anything except that they wanted to work together again on a particular project ***GASP!!!*** This movie is not about 2 thirty something single guys partying and trying to get laid. It's about 2 forty something guys trying to get a job and maybe on the side get laid. It is OK that it's funny even though it had the nerve to not be something else that it wasn't trying to be. Really, it is.It's funny. The whole theater was laughing. The whole theater filled with teenagers, 20's, 30's, 40's, 50's and even a couple who were in their 60's were laughing because this is a funny movie. I have found that movies in which EVERYONE regardless of age laughs - then it's funny. People laughed. Not because they were attempting to dissect the meaning of life based on the symbolism of the color green, or because it was trying to prove that it is the cure for cancer. It's funny because funny people wrote and acted in it. You've got fish out of the water funny, generation gap funny, what the hell are they doing funny, situational funny, awkward funny, oh my god did they just go there funny, OH MY GOD I AM LAUGHING SO HARD at that right now funny.

When did just being funny equal not funny?I knew before going that the critics whined it's formulaic. Is this the 1st film they've ever seen? ALL films are formulaic. They've ALL been done before. Before Hollywood even existed it had all been done before. Get over it. Sometimes a movie is just a movie. It's entertainment. It's there for you to laugh at, and to laugh some more. It's not pandering with certain lighting, and breathless dialogue, while the actresses bat their doe eyes begging for an Oscar. It's just being funny. It's perfectly OK to make a movie that you just want to have people laugh along with. Or at.So, see it and laugh. Or see it and refuse to laugh because principals or something. Or don't see it.

The group of misfits comes together to take on the other team led by a huge jerk, with a romance building between two characters along the sidelines.Despite a script that you can predict half an hour into the movie, the comedy is wonderful. This movie has some of the laugh out loud funniest moments of any movie I've seen in a while.

It's amusing without having you rolling in the aisles.

There was hardly any ""conflict"" or adversity. Poorly produced... a lot of big names in the movie makes it even worse. Will Ferrell's character was embarrassingly bad.

This film shows what these executives believe the minds of a younger generation look like. Simple, intricate but simple. It shows what they believe their ideal working environment would look like, some sort high tech never-never land. It's unbelievably patronising that they think this is believable.

Besides is full with clichés plots: from hard to get girl who eventually is blown away to the ""worst"" team finishing first (with the predictable ""unexpected"" twist included) and characters : Indian IT leader, introvert programming genius etc.2 Is not romantic - Well that usually is not a problem because not every movie has to be, but i just don't get it why he's trying to be. They want to kill two birds with one stone but is not working : just drop it. If you aim for this kind of audience better get rid of the obscene jokes (Will Ferrell seems to enjoy those roles)or the gynephilia references otherwise is just plain awkward and embarrassing (if you are a grown up).3 Is not even a comedy - That's the part that bother me most, because i started watching the movie with this preconception. Not a laugh :( in fact maybe just one or two smiles. The script is so dull and the little details are so clumsy: (eg) the fight with the kid's coach or even the fight in the club. They are obvious introduced just for the laughs but they don't have any ""charm"" or logic.Conclusion: if the above complains are fine with you, then you can go see it because the basic concept is OK.

For me movie was interesting just because it's interesting to see how Google campus looks like, what kind of people are there, and, I think, director shows it very well. After watching this movie viewers probably have messed feeling about Google. From one side we see amazing impact that Google has in our lives. During the movie this statements appear sometimes.

This movie has its own story and screenplay and if you really think 'The internship' is really similar to wedding crasher I must say may be Vince Vaughn dialogue delivery pattern was the same but story is totally different, unique and inspiring that middle aged guy lost their job but they did not lose their hope and find a better job then they do before. I enjoyed this movie a lot.I totally recommend this Movie",The Internship
291,lisairma,OK movie,5,2 November 2013,"This movie had great conditions to become good, it has a good story and well-known actors, but unfortunately it never gets that interesting. It starts good but then it just gets trite. It has its moments, and I laughed a few times. Some parts of the movie are better than others. It's also ridiculous how much product placement Google has in this movie. So, this is an OK movie. Nothing special. I hardly recommend it, but it works as a feel-good movie. It's kinda hard to say which audience this movie has. I think it's a movie everyone can relate to in some way, I mean everybody knows Google.",The Internship

I Played it and sat there is utter silence with my eyes rolling in my head..basically one big add for Google and minimal laughs in between! I laughed more when I let one rip during the movie! Don't bother with this one people. I'm now changing my search engine in protest! This was a real let down. I would have expected far more from these two. Next time I see these two on a movie i'll not be watching it. Even throwing in Will Ferrell didn't help at all. For this one to just scape in My choice would have been Steve Carrel and Ben Stiller for this one.",The Internship

She's so embarrassed, she's says, but her job at Google didn't pay her enough to make ends meet. (??!?!) Ah yes, it's justified then! And then the only female character on the intern team admits that she's never had a sexual experience in her life thus far and only imagines these situations, which is apparently something she feels ashamed of. Meanwhile, another male team member gets multiple lap dances resulting in him having to use the hand dryer in the bathroom after each. Not sure how this extended scene contributed anything to the movie beyond confirming the writing was horrible and adding to the overall shallow-mindedness and cheap laughs. And we wonder why there aren't more women in the technology industry.",The Internship
295,bernard-pirlea,Excellent Movie,9,10 June 2015,"The Internship is an exceptional comedy produced by 20th Century Fox Film Corporation. I saw this movie after being recommended by a friend of mine, and it was the right choice.The film presents the story of two salesman Billy and Nick whose careers have been destroyed by the digital age. Looking for a job and trying to prove they are not ancient, they get a chance in a internship program at Google, along with an army of brilliant college students. Now they must compete with the world's most remarkable minds in technology to gain a job at one of the most admired company in hi tech.The performance of Vince Vaughn playing Billy and Owen Wilson portraying Nick is impressive. The chemistry between them is powerful, as both of them are talented comedian actors. The director Shawn Levy made an excellent job with this feature, bringing both inspiring and comedic scenes in front of us. As we expected in a comedy, the soundtrack is cheerful and a suitable choice.I would no doubt recommend The Internship to anyone who loves a good laugh, or who wants to be inspired by a story of taking chances.",The Internship
296,elgoogtnuocca73,Terrible,1,9 January 2014,"This was the worst movie I've seen in years. It was not very funny, most of the jokes were forced and barely registered a smile. The leads were trying too hard to capture the youthful frat boy nostalgia from their wedding crashers days or something. I'm baffled by how this junk even got green-lighted. It was sad and embarrassing to watch how desperately unfunny Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are in this movie. Their ""schtick"" was just rambling, firing off a bunch of words, attempting to play off each other like comedy teams of yore but it viewed like a cacophony of noise. It was either bad writing or perhaps they were improvising. Instead of clever it was just cheesy and awful. I did not like the plot of two 40-year-olds that don't know about computers when everybody's grandma is on Facebook. Please.",The Internship

I like it a lot- after all the heavy stuff this is a feel good movie. really it is like a prep-talk by your coach...even if, yes, the storyline is a bit lame and cheesy;) but the actors make up for it ten times!

Although I got the obligatory Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson chuckles a couple times (Why I gave it a 2 and not a one) still felt I needed to shower with ajax and a brillo pad after watching this.It reassures me that corporate giants have no place in films and just because their pockets may be deep there is no need to prostitute actors out to show ""how cool they are"" or in what ways they differ from typical corporations by making a lousy hipster feel-good movie.Goes very far to show just how vain and conceited Google is, after all have you ever tried working with them? When asked how much it would cost to advertise on Google the corporate response is ""how much are you willing to spend?"" Wish I could do business that way...",The Internship
299,drushernwhcseagles,Veryyyy GoooooD!,9,7 February 2014,This was very good movie. Very funny!! Man that Asian guy was making it rain at that strip club!! Well overall it had a good plot to it. I mean it was competing for an internship at Google I have never heard of that plot before! All of the movies I see today are pretty much cliché and bogus. But this one really takes the cake. I was laughing so hard about 75% of the time. I will recommend this to anyone I mean anyone! Of course if you are like 12 or older. I liked when they snag Thrift Shop that was like the best part.

There is some lewd (sex related) at the strip club. 12-14+ depending on what kind of parent you are.,The Internship

301,touchpaper,Does what It says on the tin and More.,6,21 May 2014,"THE INTERNSHIP REVIEW -- RUNTIME: 119 APPROX -- CERTIFICATE 12A The Internship will be sure to give you what it says on the tin and more; as two penniless goods salesmen – Billy McMahon and Nick Campbell become out-lived by the age of technology and search for an internship at possibly the biggest internet company: Google. This film wouldn't be what it is without the clichéd simple dilemma; they both know nothing about computers. This plot changer (if there is a plot in the first place) sets the story up for some surprisingly comical gags, while at the same time letting Google advertise its hundreds of products; which hand in hand make this film seem like a long, dragged out advert on the comedy channel-the kind of advert that makes you want to kill someone. Director Shawn Levy did a fantastic job creating the cheeky one-liners that this film is fraught with. Overall, the film is fun and aspects of it are creative; let's be honest, with a cast including Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, you can't go wrong. The movie focuses on two, quirky, socially awkward and slightly frantic 40 year olds: Billy (Vince Vaughn) and Nick (Owen Wilson). At points, Billy seems like the ring leader of the freak show circus that this film is. Other times, it's the latter. It is proved that these actors collaborate in a phenomenal fashion and get the job done well, playing the goofy caricatures that we all have inside of us. Vince Vaughn does a brilliant job jittering around scenes with seamless transitions, and as the film comes in at a surprising 119 minutes this is quintessential. Owen Wilson evidently strives in his comfort zone when playing Nick; this isn't surprising considering his previous titles (Wedding Crashers, Midnight In Paris, Disney Cars). Overall, both actors play their characters extraordinarily well, in not such an extraordinary film, for you soon find out that hiring them was a brilliant mistake. In this film, it is hard to specifically identify an amazing scene because the actors are trying too hard to create exquisite transitions throughout the film; all the scenes seem to clump together into a squible of mess with no clear stopping points. Despite this fact, some scenes were more hysterical than others, including the slightly random ""quidditch"" game taking place between the interns. As you could guess, both Billy and Nick have no idea what is going on. This scene is fast paced and somehow manages to create tension that no quidditch game has ever created! While pretending to fly around on broomsticks is fun, the scene itself did seem like a completely random ""outtake"" included in the film, and while funny, had no place in computer programing or the film. The director showed almost absolute diligence when choosing such an interesting soundtrack. The expertly performed music fits the scene well and doesn't have to try hard to create a pleasing atmosphere; music consists of pieces from B.o.B, Calvin Harris, and many more reputable artists. This gives hope when knowing the director has chosen well in the line of music for this rather unusual film. The internship does well to be the quirky, fun film that it was made out to be; nevertheless, it's nothing new. This fact could hold you back, knowing that nothing special is going to happen, apart from the strip club scene. I won't enlighten you on the unique aspects of the film as there just aren't that many to spoil. Although critics seem to be overly strict on this movie, it should be noted how hard it has been to create another masterpiece comedy since 1982's Oscar winning Tootsie. Only two other films have succeeded: Juno (2007) and Midnight in Paris (2011) It has to be said that the way the film is portrayed gives the idea that a giant Google ad-campaign was prevalent, with the brands colourful logo around every corner, it was hard to ignore, creating slight disappointment and a sluggish approach, A journalist working for Google also wrote an article stating how the film portrayed Google's Office's as completely incorrect and fictional and that the company only lent the name. I somehow felt slight sympathy for the director, who had to cut many scenes out of the film, including one where a prototype Google car crashes. As you can imagine, Google wanted none of it. Overall the film is light and funny at parts; it also does well to create an atmosphere with the chosen actors and soundtrack, so I have to give credit to the director. The writer however didn't do such a good job scrawling down lines that are quite frankly in-superior to other titles of a similar genre. This film is rated 12a by the BBFC, this, by definition suggests that the film is suitable by people of 12 or older but can be seen by those younger under adult supervision. There are various ""dirty"" scenes as well as frequent bad language. If this is something that you can't live without then there is always the ""unrated"" version that can be purchased which, I'm told, is packed with bad language and nudity. The film is available on DVD to purchase in all major retailers as of late 2013.You could always just Google it.",The Internship
302,amjadmoghul,One of the worst tripe I have forced my eyes to view,1,23 May 2014,"I saw this movie yesterday, and was compelled to write a review, just to warn others not to waste around 2 hours of their life.The whole premise is dreadful. Two 40 something's who know nothing about computing (are salesmen), applying for an internship at Google. It gets worse from there.There is only one gag about the phone-in interview and the blender question which i thought was amusing. Otherwise, I kept thinking it has to get better - but instead it just gets worse.I am really surprised Google even let their brand be dragged through the mud like this.How can a google Team Leader allow his team to go to a strip club, when they have a deadline to write an app, which allows them to win the internship? Its plain ridiculous. You see what is going to happen a mile off, and as predicted, the underdog wins the day (or internship) and the two hopeless salesmen even become proficient enough to work in the customer support helpline, and answering calls on all of their products.Worthless movie. I am surprised it even got made, and more surprised that the ""leading characters"" (Owen and Vaughn) accepted to do this - movie - but as someone said - it seems all about the money (into owen and vaughns pockets) and branding advertising by google.Read an accountancy book instead, it will probably have more laughs..",The Internship
303,bananabunch-16-919476,"Good story, needs more comedy!",6,1 June 2014,"This film didn't really have any load out loud moments for me, which I thought really sucked as the story line was actually really good and made me want to watch and see what was happening and not turn to my phone and look at what random people are doing on Facebook. The film starts off with Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson turning to sell a watch line to a guy who I believe owns a big company, so they are sort of a sub-company to this guy to then find out that their company has actually been closed, which they didn't know about till the meeting.You sort of feel sort for them from this point as it starts to show what can happen if you lose your company, for closures, losing loved ones or having to get a job that you hate. The idea that they don't know any IT skills at all is probably what makes you relate to them as they try to get a job at Google as it shows that you don't need experience to begin with before starting, but can gain the skills and experience over time with help and encouragement from others which is what we all believe a work place should be all about. The Google headquarters looks bright and more like something from your wildest imaginations, which makes you want to work for Google too, so that you can go to work in a place that is colourful and big. For some reason, I felt like I would have liked to see the Headphones guy more. You find out that he is important near the end but it felt like that character was lacking quite a bit and maybe more of the rivalry between the groups in the challenges, there was only short bits between two of the groups, which could have been due to the time restrictions. It would have also been good if they showed them working full time at Google at the end or if they showed them starting up the next internships challenges. Needs more comical moments, but other than that, it has a good story line and I would recommend the film.",The Internship

Definitely a great movie, will get you laughing! Vince Vaughn's movies make me laugh every single time. Even if it is a Wedding Crashers sequel it is amazing, obviously not as funny as Wedding Crashers. It shows the power of the American Dream and also how much harder it is to achieve that dream for kids growing up now. Not only is it a comedy but it also reminds us of the important things in life. Owen Wilson is a great actor and makes me crack up every time he appears on screen. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn make for a dynamic duo that will keep you laughing for hopefully more movies to come.

As a ""young person"" I felt like I could relate to the students in the movie. This may be a case of product placement, but I don't think it detracted from the movie. (Plus, Google is pretty cool. It has become a verb- that''s sure proof of success.)

310,fukasa22,WOOOOOWWWW this movie WOOOOWWW,2,6 April 2016,"It was a cool summers morning. The air was dry and the drinks were cold. I stumbled into the living room to find my brother bubbling with optimism for Vince Vaughan & Owen Wilson's latest comedy ""The Internship"". I decided to watch with him, as I had previously hugely enjoyed Wedding Crashers, the duo's previous effort. 90 minutes of tired jokes, shameless clichés and god awful product placement (Google is so fun!!), it seemed the season was suddenly an unforgiving winter. To be concise; NONE of the jokes hit home, the plot was incredibly predictable and every character was either face-meltingly boring or just unlikable. The villain is apparent through his first line of murky dialogue (and is, of course British ) and bendy nose's love interest is shoehorned in for filler bullshit.To conclude, while in no way was this were the performances in this film terrible, nor the direction or script; if you enjoy a retread of Wedding Crashers coated in faeces with 1/6 the laughs and Google as the protagonist, fair play to you. I just cannot remember a film which bored me more in my existence. Plus Will Ferrell's cameo does not hold a candle to the aforementioned Wedding Crashers. Hugely disappointing. 2/10",The Internship

Apart from being a Commercial for Google from the first minute, there were not a single good gag in there and it was at times embarrassing to watch.

It's needless to say that in real life you can't just solve everything with team spirit and talking ability, you need skills that can back you up: for sure you can't work in the technical part of Google without knowing what C++ is.

It definitely helps if you are a little bit of a fan and like these actors. If I were not a fan I'd be closer to 7 stars but that still makes it well worth watching. The film has a little dose of everything centered around the comedy. The film has some funny characters, my favorite side roll being Will Ferrel who always brings his quirky inappropriate douche baggy behavior performed to perfection. Never get tired of that. In conclusion the film is well worth a watch even if you are not a big fan of Vaughn, Wilson and Ferrel. Any cynical review is out of place because this film is lovable. If you are looking to be blown away maybe you should keep looking but worth the time.",The Internship
