0,TheLittleSongbird,Festive folly,4,19 December 2019,"Christmas is, always has been, and always will be, my favourite time of year. Not just the gifts, spending time with family and festive traditions, but also seeing over and over many Christmas films, specials etc. Have never had any bias against romantic comedies and the cast was not a bad one. Emilia Clarke was great in 'Game of Thrones' and have also loved a lot of Emma Thompson's performances (she also has a great talent for screen-writing).So there was never any bias against 'Last Christmas'. Far from it. Actually thought it looked like a pleasant diversion and wanted it to work, and am being completely honest here. Seeing it, a large part of me was underwhelmed. By all means 'Last Christmas' is not a complete bah humbug and there are things that make it semi-watchable. There is however sadly nowhere near enough to it to make it a Christmas cracker and, despite good intentions, has too much wrong with it and ones not much different to flaws that a good deal of Christmas films made today have.'Last Christmas' does have good things. It looks lovely, those locations and how they utilise the festive season are just magical complemented beautifully by the photography. The soundtrack adds a lot to the atmosphere with a healthy dose of George Michael, it's great music on its own and actually didn't have as major a problem with the placement as others did.There are moments of charm and amusing moments, while Clarke is an earnest but not overly so lead and not out of sorts in the comedy department. Michelle Yeoh also shows bundles of charm.Was not impressed with the rest of the acting. Did find Henry Goulding quite bland and slightly too creepy, while Thompson is disappointingly a bit too on the melodramatic side. The chemistry seemed to lack warmth and that's what the story, on top of being paper thin and too conventional, generally seemed to lack too. The whole thing feels competent but too bland, complete with a bizarre and not particularly necessary twist. Paul Feig's direction is a long way from amateurish but it seemed to lack spark and seemed too safe.Found the script to be disappointing and quite weak, which surprised me seeing as Thompson co-wrote it and it was difficult to believe that it was from the person who wrote the sparkling script for the wonderful 'Sense and Sensibility'. The comedy was not enough and lacked freshness and wit, found it very try too hard. The romance needed more warmth and veered on a bit on the creepy side, while the drama was a bit too maudlin from sentiment being laid on too thick. Also felt that they were not always well balanced. While its good intentions were admirable, the film tackles politics and homelessness for examples and they felt shoe-horned and needed more subtlety.Summing up, appreciated its good intentions but wanted to like it much more. 4/10",Last Christmas
1,SnoopyStyle,cute,7,2 November 2020,"Katarina ""Kate"" (Emilia Clarke) survived a life saving surgery and is now a mess. She is temporarily homeless and couch surfing her remaining friends. She's bad at her job at Santa (Michelle Yeoh)'s Christmas store. She's avoiding her mother Petra (Emma Thompson). She keeps running into nice guy Tom Webster (Henry Golding).Obviously, somebody was inspired by Mamma Mia to do another musical with a different artist. This time, it's George Michael. Emilia Clarke is being her super adorable self and this is mostly a cute single sitcom gal trying to fix her messy life. I actually like her chemistry with Michelle Yeoh the most. Emma Thompson going ethnic is a little bit off. Henry Golding is a nice guy but he doesn't have much heat with Emilia. I do like his niceness rubbing off on her. As for the reveal, I was working out two competing twists at the time and it ends up being a combination of both. I actually don't like reinterpreting the song but that's a minor sour note. In that one, the problem is that the rest of the song gets sung. All in all, Emilia's natural cuteness and the story's harmless niceness make this a cute, appealing Christmas film.",Last Christmas
2,kosmasp,I know what you did ...,7,28 July 2021,Actually what you listened to ... last christmas! This may be the one song that is equally loved and hated! And the hate is not even its fault ... it comes from the fact that you can hear it year after year ... sometimes months before ... well Christmas time.So the movie is based on the song ... or takes the song and makes a movie out of it. But that is not all ... it also takes more songs of Wham/George Michael (I think he even wrote one especially for the movie? I may be wrong about that) and incorporates them into the movie. For better or worse that is ... I love the songs but as with Last Christmas there may be people who are not too fond of them.Also this is a romantic comedy ... what do you expect to happen here? Still the charisma especially from our ... GoT star Emilia Clarke is phenomenal ... she is so lovely and cute ... how can you not love her? Add an amazing supporting cast all around ... and that music/soundtrack ... well you sort of have a winner here ... if you are into this kind of thing.,Last Christmas
3,jboothmillard,Last Christmas,3,23 December 2019,"I heard that Emma Thompson was making a movie based on the music of George Michael and Wham! months and months ago. The trailer for this movie looked like it could go on to become an instant Christmas classic, like a new Love Actually. But there were mixed reviews, but I chanced it anyway, written by Emma Thompson (Sense and Sensibility, Nanny McPhee, Bridget Jones's Baby), directed by Paul Feig (Grounded, Bridesmaids, Spy). Basically, Katarina ""Kate"" (Game of Thrones' Emilia Clarke) works a dead-end job as an elf at an all year round Christmas ornament shop in Central London. While at work she notices a man outside staring upwards. She initially shuns him, but they strike up a conversation, she learns his name is Tom (Crazy Rich Asians' Henry Golding). Kate has a habit of making bad decisions and has recently become homeless after being thrown out by her flatmate. She has aspirations to become a singer but is unsuccessful in her recent audition. Kate sees Tom again and they go for a walk, where he charms her with his bizarre observations of London. The next morning, she discovers that she forgot to lock up the shop, leading to a break-in. Her boss, referred to as ""Santa"" (Michelle Yeoh), is most disappointed in her, saying that she has changed from the charismatic and friendly person she used to be. Kate isolates herself and is forced to return to her parents' home. Yugoslavian immigrants, her mother, Petra (Emma Thompson), suffers from depression and her father, Ivan (Boris Isakovic), a former lawyer, now works as a taxi driver. Kate hates her mother, who cherishes her while ignoring her sister Marta (Lydia Leonard), a successful lawyer. Kate begins spending more time with Tom, who rides a bike and volunteers at a homeless shelter. She looks for Tom, who doesn't keep a phone, leaving it in the cupboard, and often disappears for days at a time. Kate was initially critiquing Tom for working at the homeless shelter, begins helping there in the hope of running into him, but the staff have never met him. While celebrating Marta's promotion, Kate inadvertently outs Marta as a lesbian in a long-term relationship. She then runs into Tom, who takes her back to his apartment. Kate reveals that a year earlier she was seriously ill and had to have a heart transplant. Kate says she feels half dead and questions whether she has the talent to make it as a performer. After opening up to Tom, Kate tries to initiate sex, but he declines. After spending the night with Tom, Kate starts to improve her life, taking care of her body, setting up Santa with a Danish man (Peter Mygind) who loves Christmas like she does, apologising to Marta and her girlfriend, and busking singing Christmas songs to raise money for the shelter. After a few days she runs into Tom again, but he shuts down the idea of a relationship, she walks away thinking he does not truly love her. Nevertheless, Kate continues to try to do good in her daily life. Later, wanting to make amends, Kate returns to Tom's apartment, but an estate agent reveals it is for sale, as the previous owner died in a bicycle accident a year ago. Finding his phone in the cupboard, Kate realises that Tom was the organ donor whose heart is now inside her, and that all their interactions were hallucinations. Kate returns to a small garden, she encounters Tom's ghost, he says his heart will always belong to her. Kate organises a Christmas talent show for the people at the shelter and invites all her friends, new and old, Santa and the Danish man and her entire family. Kate performs a solo the Wham! song ""Last Christmas"", during which flashbacks of her so-called ""encounters"" with Tom are seem, then the curtain raises, and she is joined by the band of performers. Later, Kate and the family celebrate Christmas together joined by Alba (Jade Anouka), Marta's girlfriend, for the first time. The Christmas celebrations end and it is summer, Kate is looking visibly healthier, sitting in the garden on a bench with a plaque with Tom's name and birth and death years. Kate is happy and smiles, and follows Tom's advice, to always look up. Also starring Patti LuPone as Joyce, Rebecca Root as Dr. Addis, Sue Perkins as Ice Show Director, Peter Serafinowicz as Theatre Producer, Rob Delaney as Theatre Director and Amit Shah as Andy. Clarke gives a charming performance and does have a nice singing voice, Golding is more strange than seductive as the mystery man, the chemistry between them isn't too bad. The lyrics ""last Christmas I gave you my heart"" are taken very literally, this is the main plot of the film, otherwise it is full of scenes with ""Heal the Pain"", ""Too Funky"", ""Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go"", ""Fastlove"" and of course the title song playing in the background. Unfortunately, this film is a bit all over the place, the sentimental stuff is often hit and miss, the homelessness and charitable stuff sort of works, there a hilarious discussion of the difference between ""penis"" and ""dick"", otherwise most of the laughs are average, it is often odd and clichéd, and the ghost twist is daft, overall it is a predictable, silly and disappointing seasonal romantic comedy. Adequate!",Last Christmas
4,studioAT,"Ignore the negative reviews, ""look up"" , and realise what a great film this is.",8,23 November 2019,"I don't understand why the critics have been so harsh on this film - I thoroughly enjoyed it!Yes, it's predictable, but what Christmas film isn't really?With a wonderful central performance from the ever lovely Emilia Clarke and with good support from Emma Thompson, this is a wonderful film with a lovely message.I would say give it a chance, you won't be disappointed.",Last Christmas
5,CinemaSerf,Christmas 2019 comes early...,7,20 November 2019,"This is quite a joyous little Christmas film with an interesting twist at the end and a gentle reminder for us to consider those less fortunate at this time of year. Emilia Clarke carries off her role as a slightly self-destructive elf quite charismatically - though the script is a touch wordy at times. Emma Thompson and Michelle Yeoh steal their scenes and the Wham/George Michael soundtrack adds a soupçon of nostalgia to the proceedings. The hero is, however, a bit of a drip. Easy on the eye, but he is still a bit of a wet blanket. That said, they all look like they had fun making this, and that does come across. At any other time of year, I probably wouldn't recommend this at a cinema, but it does put a smile on your face so go on, give it a go!",Last Christmas
6,phd_travel,Saved by the ending,6,24 January 2020,"Some parts of this movie are pretty awful and some parts are quite good. The good thing is because of the surprising twist ending it doesn't feel like a typical Hallmark style Christmas romance. It was actually quite moving. Emma Thompson acts quite well as the Yugoslavian immigrant.Some of the dialogue is too fast and many of the jokes fall flat. The way Michelle Yeoh's character acts is painful at times. Luckily Emilia Clarke is winsome enough to smooth over the rough edges. And she and Henry Golding have a good rapport.
There is an anti Brexit message. And a very diverse cast racially and by sexual orientation. The George Michael song sounds quite good too.",Last Christmas
7,gradyharp,Look up......,8,24 February 2020,"Just when we think the gush of Christmas commercials and specials are over, along comes LAST CHRISTMAS, and if ever there were a film that could enchant, this is one that does. Written by Emma Thompson (who also plays a significant role in the movie) and Greg Wise with screenplay adaptation aided by Bryony Kimmings, the film seems a bit of fluff, overly decorated, until the messages begin to sink in. And by the end the film is elevating, thanks to some fine acting and direction. George Michael's music plays a primary role, also.Katrina/Kate (Emilia Clarke) is a young woman subscribed to bad decisions. Working as an elf in a year round Christmas store owned by 'Santa' (Michele Yeoh) is not good for the wannabe singer. However, there she meets Tom (Henry Golding), a kind-hearted man with a mysterious past who challenges her cynical worldview. Kate slowly comes to realize that Tom is 'significant' and her life takes a new turn. For Kate, it seems too good to be true. Completing the entourage is Kate's Yugoslavian immigrant family - mother Petra (Emma Thompson), father Ivan (Boris Isakovic) and sister Marta (Lydia Leonard) - each with conflicts and problems of their own. It all comes together with a discovery (one that should not be shared) and the grand finale at the homeless sanctuary is rich in honest goodwill - 'helping each other.'This is a feel good movie, well acted, and one that can be uplifting - if you've a mind to be uplifted!",Last Christmas
8,deloudelouvain,If you like Christmas and George Michael or Wham songs.,6,20 December 2020,"Last Christmas isn't the kind of movie I normally would go for but since my wife likes to be in the Christmas spirit and because she loves songs from George Michael and Wham I just gave it a shot. My wife scores it a seven, I score it a five so six will be the average rating for us. It's a romantic movie with a bit of drama, but not a lot of comedy in my opinion. You will get every George Michael song so be prepared. The cast wasn't bad even though I prefer watching Emilia Clarke as the mother of dragons than as an elf, but she's eye candy and a decent actress so it's okay. There's a nice little twist towards the end so that's a bonus. Last Christmas is definitely more a chick flick than anything else but I guess I watched worse in the past in this genre.",Last Christmas
9,Lejink,Careless Christmas,4,20 December 2020,"""Last Christmas"" the Wham song, long ago joined the pantheon of classic festive numbers almost the second it was released, especially in the U. K. but of course that pleasant association of Christmas and George Michael changed irrevocably when the singer sadly died on Christmas Day 2016, a final parting shot to music fans at the end of a year which had already taken David Bowie and Prince before their respective times.Perhaps this seasonal movie named after the song, set in London and featuring a soundtrack based almost exclusively on Michael songs, was some kind of attempt to emphatically claim back the holiday positively for the late singer with a hoped-for perennial Christmas classic film but if that was the aim, it failed to do so.Emilia Clarke is Kate, not Katerina, an aspiring actress, a kooky young Londoner and devoted George Michael fan, no kidding, who lives a peripatetic life-style, of no fixed abode, rolling from one friend's house to another, flitting from boyfriend to boyfriend, avoiding her eccentric Croatian parents and working in the world's worst Christmas gift shop by day when not trying out for singing parts in shows. Oh, and this is important, she underwent major surgery the Christmas before which incredibly, none of her friends or family mention at all, for a very good reason in fact, as it turns out...Her indulgent boss at the store is Michelle Yeoh, herself looking for love from an older man and who is struck by Cupid's arrow which sees her somewhat inexplicably fall for a middle-aged but decidedly weird middle-aged dreamboat who keeps coming back to the shop. But Kate too has her own mysterious admirer, a handsome young Asian man who flits in and out of her life, helps her out and picks her up when she's down, without coming onto her too heavily.By the end, in a surprising twist, the identity of her reluctant suitor is revealed in the most extraordinary and unbelievable only-in-pictures circumstances when we learn at last the significance of a throwaway line in Michael's classic Christmas song which I'm pretty sure wasn't the way its writer intended.While I liked this tour of festive London and especially its less salubrious spots, as well as the music, no real effort was made like say ""Mamma Mia"", to align the songs to the actual story. The characters to a person are unbelievable, all seeming to have stepped out of that oddly unnatural Curtisland, you know those wonderfully lovable people who frequent ""Notting Hill"", ""Love Actually"" and ""Four Weddings And A Funeral"" where they seem like everyday people but in fact talk in sentences people just never use.The attempts at humour fall flat, especially those involving Emma Thomoson's Croatian mother while the moralising vignettes on racial and sexual intolerance, plus a sideswipe at Brexit, are embarrassingly naive and ineffectual.Co-written by Thompson and director Paul Feig, this is one Christmas film from which I'd say it's better to keep your distance and to save you from tears, give your heart to something (more) special, instead.",Last Christmas
10,ThomasDrufke,Look Up,6,14 November 2019,"My immediate thought leaving the theater was that I wish this film just popped up on Netflix one day without any marketing or promotion. That way, we wouldn't have had the theories about the trailer (and a certain character) to potentially ruin the experience. I won't say that my experience was completely ruined, but it was certainly impacted by a simple internet theory that may or may not have turned out to be true. Is that ultimately fair for the film? No, but I review the movie based on my experience along with the quality, not just the latter. Last Christmas is far from a bad movie, but it's also nowhere near a great one either. Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding make for a solid romantic team on screen, the music is solid (both soundtrack & score), and I was never bored. However, the dialogue is cringey more often than not, some of the supporting performances feel mailed in, and the plot is as predictable as you think after seeing the trailer. But if you're looking to kickstart the holiday season with an enjoyable yet flawed Christmas flick, then take a shot with this one.6.2/10",Last Christmas
11,A_Different_Drummer,The real mystery,10,8 January 2020,"The real mystery is not the plot twist. The real mystery is, what happened to our expectations about movies to make so many people think they can easily find a ""better"" X-mas movie somewhere else, making it OK to give this one a low rating? For the last few decades, some 95% of all the X-mas movies produced have come from Canada, using basically the same actors and writers, and they do not even come close to this one. This is a real movie that engages and holds the attention, with real talent both in front of and behind the camera. Cmon people, follow the example of the main character in LAST XMAS, grow up.",Last Christmas
12,inkblot11,"Infused with George Michael's music and Emma Thompson's grand wit, this dramedy has much laughter, tears, and heart",8,17 November 2019,"Kate/Katarina (Emilia Clarke) is an immigrant to Britain, with her family, coming after Yugoslavia broke up. Once singing in church, she longs to make it in musical theater. However, life has thrown her off track. Her mother (Emma Thompson) is overbearing, her sister is a successful lawyer with sharp disagreements with Kate, and our Katarina has health problems. So, now, Kate works at a year-round Christmas store, as an elf-saleslady under the direction of store owner, Santa (Michelle Yeoh). Its a living? Well, yes, but Kate has been couch surfing and has no permanent home but her parents house. One day she meets a handsome man on a bicycle, Tom (Henry Golding) who advises her to ""look up"". Its akin to stop and smelling the roses but Kate wants none of this gooey philosophy, at first. But, on subsequent encounters, Kate begins to notice things she's never seen before and to appreciate the friendship/love Tom has been offering. Can Tom change Kate's life for the good? This lovely new addition to the repertoire of Christmas cinema has a strong foundation in its script by Emma Thompson, a wonderful cast, lovely sets and costumes, and the eternally grand music of George Michael in its soundtrack. Be prepared for laughter and tears, as unexpected happenings keep arriving. But, in short, don't be last in line for Last Christmas!",Last Christmas

This is a sweet and cute movie. Performances were very good and story was pretty involving and surprising as well.

14,ironhorse_iv,This Christmas movie had a lot of heart. It was decently entertaining.,7,1 January 2020,"Things are starting to look up for Emilia Clarke. From all of her work, this might be the best so far. Her singing was amazing. Yet it's not the best acting from her. She was just alright. I just never really felt that her character Kate seem that alcoholic and depress about her past near death experience. Don't get me wrong, she does do a bundle of bad decisions including one that should had gotten her fired from her job as an elf in a surprising year round Christmas shop never seem to have an off day with customers. However, the movie directed by Paul Feig & written by Bryony Kimmings and Emma Thompson, who co-wrote the story with her husband, Greg Wise doesn't go too dark on her struggles and explore her trauma too much due to the PG-13 rating. We never get an explanation of why the surreal events are just now happening. Instead, the movie focus way too much in the beginning digging through her childhood rather than her troubled adulthood. Like honestly, did we really need all those historical inaccuracies scenes involving Yugoslavia in 1999? It could had been cut. The film is also oddly over political about the current immigration problem. Those scenes like the one on the bus felt a bit random, forced and somewhat one sided on the issue. Plus they don't really related to the main story as much as it could had. Despite that, I get what they were going for. I hate discrimination against minorities but I do understand those who travel to another country to live should do it legal through their host immigration laws. It's a very complex issue that the film try to make it seem so easy. It wasn't really needed for a film like this. As with the sub plot of her sister Martha (Lydia Leonard) being afraid to come out as a lesbian to her parents, Petra (Emma Thompson) & Ivan (Boris Isakovic). I felt it try to be too current and took away some of the focus of Kate's main story. Regardless it was just nice to witness such a diverse well acted cast of characters especially the leading man. Asian Male Love Interest is very rare to see in European movies. Henry Golding was great as Tom Webster even if his dream boat good looking but kind character seem one dimensional all boy-scout too good to be true. I just wish he suffer similar issues like Kate but dealing with it better. After all both share a huge bond once you figure out the plot twist. Don't get me wrong, both Clarke & Golding had great chemistry with each other. However the way their characters met could had been better with a more sophistical mature approach. Instead of a silly random out of the blue curiosity scene involving a bird outside her store. The movie could had shown them briefly meeting before Kate's unexplained illness, and then meeting at the hospital much later as he is one getting sick while Kate drink herself to death in front of him. Better yet just have him be related to Santa (Michelle Yeoh) to show why the boss is bitter with Kate's current life choices yet cool exterior enough not to make Kate's life worst by firing her due to irresponsibility. These might have help fill some of the bigger plot holes like how Kate gained access to Tom's apartment or know how Tom look like once the plot twist is reveal and why was on the phone in the cupboard and what is in it. Those weren't never explained. Just think how stronger the story would had been if they went those types of routes. Nevertheless the plot twist is pretty predictable seeing how the title of the movie is based on a song about giving a piece of yourself to your love ones or the fact that the singer George Michaels die from dilated cardiomyopathy. You didn't need the dumbing of the audience flashback to explain what happen to Tom in the past once the plot twist is revealed. The title is good enough. Even if you didn't pay attention reading the title, the movie overplays that song to the point that you have to be deaf not to figure the twist out. The song does get somewhat annoying as well due to the repetitive nature. After a while I really couldn't stand listening to it any longer. Despite that the rest of the soundtrack was pretty good even if it's clearly a collection to Michaels' greatest hits. I just wish the movie establish the music being sung in story a little better than a minor mention of Kate being a huge fan of Wham & a cameo during the Christmas show. As for humor the movie was a mixed bag for me. Some like the mean-spirited judging panel and the homeless people stealing biscuits was out right awkward to laugh at. I just found the majority of the jokes to be meh. Since comedy is subjective; others might find it funnier or a lot duller. Overall: Despite the bitter sweet ending and the movie not being that romantic or comedic. The film still has a very strong message about trying to be happy by doing good deals for others or at least be thankful that you're living rather than six feet under. While not the best romantic Christmas movie. At least, this Christmas rom com is better than most Hallmark Channel films. It's still worth watching.",Last Christmas
15,slightlymad22,Excellent Use Of George Michael's Song Heal The Pain,7,16 November 2019,"I just got out of Last ChristmasThere are several laugh out loud moments in this and my audience seemed to really enjoy it, but it didn't always work for me.George Michael's music is the highlight of the movie. They especially use the track Heal The Pain really well, even more so than the use of Last Christmas.Emilia Clarke (Danaerys Targarean from Game Of Thrones) is an actress I have a real soft spot for, and she does well here, probably the best I have seen her in a movie since Me Before You. Henry Golding is fine as the male lead, Michelle Yeoh made me smile a few times, but for me Emma Thompson got the biggest laugh in the movie.Clarke's character is not particularly likeable to begin with, she is a selfish, promiscuous, heavy drinker who constantly upsets her friends and does not seem to care about her actions. You know she will have changed come the end, as in all good Christmas movies, but if anyone but the loveable Clarke played the role, if have had a hard time caring about her.It is more than a tad predictable and is heavy on the foreshadowing and at times hits you over the head with its message, I don't think it is designed to be a Christmas classic, but it's an ok 90 minutes, especially if you like George Michael's music, Emilia Clarke or Emma Thompson.My cinema was pretty full, And they seemed to enjoy it",Last Christmas
16,UniqueParticle,Emilia Clarke is so gorgeous and makes this worth watching,8,6 September 2020,"A charming rom-com based on George Micheals song Last Christmas!

17,cruise01,Different direction for a romantic comedy which was enjoyable.,6,24 November 2019,"Last Christmas (3 out of 5 stars).Last Christmas is a romantic comedy film that follows its cliché roots about a young woman who does not have much luck until she meets a guy which she falls for. The film can have some dramatic turns of relatable situations. While the twist in the end does make the film very unpredictable which hits the film at an emotional level.The plot follows Kate (Emilia Clarke) a young woman who suffered an illness and has never been the same. Her mother tries to be over caring for her. She works at a Santa's elf store owned by Santa (Michelle Yeoh). She does not have much luck when it comes to disasters from meeting guys in a hook up to getting kicked out where ever she lives. She meets Tom (Henry Golding) who is confident and spirited about everything. Which turns her life around.The film plot is decent. It is nothing new. It does show the emotional impact it has on someone who is ill. Kate relationship with her parents are distant. She barely has any friends. She is trying to audition for roles which she gets rejected. Her boss at the Santa shop is annoyed with her laziness at work. And irresponsibility. But she is always giving hope and chances for her cause she still believes in her.Emilia Clarke is lovable as an actress. The role worked perfect for her and it worked well. Emma Thompson playing her mother was also fun. Henry Golding did well playing the high spirited guy that changes her perspective in life.I did find the movie to be kind of slow and boring for most of the first hour. Kate and Tom randomly bumping into each other. He is mysterious to her cause he never carries his phone around cause he does not believe in it. He volunteers at a homeless shelter at midnight. She can barely plan anything with him. Which he is trying to keep a distant?The twist in the end without giving away details really surprised me and I did not see coming at all. It did leave an emotional feeling with the characters. The soundtrack of the film with some George Michael songs being used was a lot of fun.Overall, Last Christmas is a fair film. The romantic comedy theme was over done and used. The plot is decent. The cast was good and the twist really made the film worth watching.",Last Christmas
18,eddie_baggins,Not the Xmas classic it wanted to be,4,27 April 2020,"There's no doubt that it means well, with this Emma Thompson penned and George Michael inspired feel-good effort always having its heart in the right place but its overtly sappy and almost too clean feel makes Last Christmas a wannabe Love Actually like yuletide classic that never truly gives off that special Xmas cheer.Curiously directed by Paul Feig, who really dials things back from what you'd expect from the man behind Bridesmaids and Spy, Christmas tells one of those too good to be true like love stories and finding oneself drama's as it focuses on Emilia Clarke's ditzy but kind-hearted struggler Kate, who finds potential love and direction in her budding friendship with Henry Goulding's mysterious Tom in the lead up to a wintery U.K festive season.Everything about Christmas feels fairly familiar, with both Kate and Tom cut well and truly from the cloth of movie romantic tropes but the chemistry between Feig's two leads never heats up proceedings and his cast and Thompson and Bryony Kimmings script ticks off a series of predictable boxes that not even a supposed twist finale can help overcome.Instead of creating its own world and own vibe, Christmas feels constantly like its playing the easy game with its storytelling and delivery and while usually Feig is accustomed to delivering some very funny cinematic moments, Christmas is devoid of any standout moments of comedy genius as it trudges along its way through a procession of movements and scenarios that aren't going to be surprising anybody that's ever seen such a film.With this being the case, there was an extra load of pressure on Clarke and Goulding to push things up a notch but they're not given a lot to work with here with both Kate and Tom relatively so-so lead characters that don't do a lot to make us want to invest our emotions in them, even if the film seems intent on trying to wring out some unworthy emotions come the latter stages.Christmas isn't a terrible film and for what it is its most certainly watchable but with its underused foundation in George Michael's back catalogue and with an overall sense of blandness and acceptance of just being another member of the pack, you can't help but feel as though there's no real reason to recommended that anyone spend their quality time in this particular adventure.Final Say -A calmer Paul Feig gives Last Christmas a professional edge but its so-so story, weak chemistry between its leads and generic procession ensures it's not even close to becoming the new festive classic it clearly wanted to be.2 narrow alleyways out of 5",Last Christmas
19,Ed-Shullivan,Feel Good = 10 ** Musical Score = 10 ** Romance = 10 ** Emilia Clarke = 10,10,22 November 2020,"How can you go wrong by blending a full suite of George Michael's classic hit songs, a Christmas themed film that is so well written (with a surprise twist) and stars the very multi-talented actress Emilia Clarke. Mrs. Shullivan and I decided t make this our first Christmas film of this the 2020 holiday season, and the film left us with a full heart of FEEL GOOD romance, family dynamics, social inclusiveness, and most importantly it left us both with that wonderful Christmas spirit reminiscent to watching an age old Christmas classic such as ""It's a Wonderful Life (1946)"" and/or ""Miracle on 34th Street (1947)"".This was a great Christmas spirit themed film and sure to become an annual Christmas classic for many decades to come, on so many entertainment and family value levels. Michelle Yeoh, plays store owner Santa, in her Christmas themed two storey retail store in which she employs Kate as her top elf and salesgirl. Emma Thompson who plays Emilia Clarke's immigrant Yugoslovian mother who suffers from depression and we see that the family dynamics between Katarina/Kate (Emilia Clarke) her mother Petra (Emma Thompson), her father Ivan (Boris Isakovic) who has a law degree from his homeland of Yugoslavia but has to settle being employed as a mini cab driver in London, and her estranged sister Marta (Lydia Leonard) who has a secret of her own not shared with her parents.Katarina/Kate is struggling to find peace, sanity after enduring a serious illness a year ago and to come full circle with her parents and her sister and as the film progresses we see how Katarina slowly through a series of her own misfortunes she finally comes to attain her inner peace in both her mind and her soul that we all strive to achieve in our own personal life struggles and our own family dynamics. Mrs. Shullivan and I laughed, and we cried, and the music score of so many George Michael's classic songs made the film a perfect 10 out of 10 IMDB rating. We also get to see the city of London, England dressed for the holiday season, and as the popular holiday song written by Frank Loesser in 1944, Baby, It's Cold Outside, the actors worked through the cold London winter on the River Thames to make this a Christmas classic for the ages.It's a MUST SEE and will become an annual Christmas classic on many top ten holiday lists. Watch it and you won't be disappointed.",Last Christmas

She meets a mysterious man named Tom Webster who disappears and reappears every so often. But is he too good to be true?The story is nice,the songs by George Micheal were great as I'm a massive fan of his and so is my mom.

A decent Christmas movie.,7,19 November 2019,"Forgetting all about Thanksgiving and moving to Christmas, Last Christmas is the perfect Holiday movie about how miracles can change lives. A story laired over the sounds of the late Great Gorge Micheal. Is this how those broadway musicals inspired by recording artist work? I'm guessing Emmy Thompson who starred produced and wrote this movie had a thing for the singer.
Overall,Last Christmas does get you in the mood for Christmas but the magic of the Holliday is not all there. Sometimes it's trying harder than it needs to making it cornier than it needs to but I guess that's ok for getting us into the Christmas spirit.

And her job is also going down, and during the time of Christmas. And things start to change when she meets Tom(Henry Golding), a handsome nice guy who tries to take her out of her misery, but is he too good to be true?
I really like the way the film was not trying to be predicable, I mean you think it's going in one direction, and it surprises you. There is a twist, which I won't reveal, although I kind of saw coming. Emilia Clarke does shine has Kate, scenes you like her even though at times you're not supposed to like her, but you can't help but like her. Henry Golding is also quite charming, his scenes with Clarke, are quite joyful to watch. Michelle Yeoh is also good. A well made comedy drama Christmas movie.",Last Christmas

This is a rom com that is written by Emma Thompson and directed by Paul Feig-A Simple Favor, Ghostbusters_2016, Bridesmaids. Emilia plays a young lady with problems. First, she had health problems and had to have a heart transplant. Next, she keeps making bad decisions in her life, such as alienating her family and friends and becoming pretty much homeless-nobody will let her stay with them for long. Even her mother, Emma, gives her lectures on her lifestyle choices. Michelle owns a Christmas store and gives Emilia a job as one of her Santa's elfs. Then, Henry walks into Emilia's life and tries to teach her how to straighten up her act and enjoy life again. Yep, this is a rom com alright but there is one little plot twist near the end-it involves a famous movie but I can't say much about it without giving too much away. There is a lot of George Michael-and Wham-songs throughout, with the title of the movie being one of them.

I'm really glad to see Emilia Clarke in this sort of roles because she's fantastic in the comedy genre and hopefully, now that Game of Thrones' foot is off her neck (thank god), she'll be doing more of it. I don't care if the films are trash, I'll watch.
It's funny bc most people were annoyed at the fact that the plot twist was so obvious (I won't even put the spoilers filter in this review bc it's pointless) but I literally watched it bc I wanted to watch said plot twist executed. And it wasn't badly executed at all.
It's shallow (like all romcoms) but it's cute and funny and has a bit of heart so if you're bored and want to watch something simple I'll recommend it.Anyway, has anyone noticed how Charles Dickens went completely silent after this came out??

32,kirbylee70-599-526179,POST HOLIDAY PLEASER,8,9 March 2020,"When you choose to make a film based around a holiday you run the risk of the film being bypassed once that holiday is over. Even during the holidays I had no real desire to see the film LAST CHRISTMAS. So imagine my surprise to find it one of the most delightful films I've seen in some time.Emilia Clarke stars as Kate, a young woman living in London who works in an all year round Christmas shop dressed as an elf. Her boss is simply named Santa (Michelle Yeoh), an owner who has a habit of stocking some unusual items in her store. While working there Kate also attempts to launch a career singing in productions, auditioning for nearly any part available and never landing a role.Kate is in the middle of a bad period in her life. Her career is going nowhere, she has no place of her own to live, counting on the kindness of her friends to put her up. But even there her luck runs bad as she doesn't take long to do something that results in her being kicked out. Her love life is on the outs as well with frequent hookups that lead to nothing more serious than a one night stand. Her relationship with her sister is one of mutual disapproval and the one with her mother is even worse.Kate's mother (Emma Thompson who also wrote the story and produced the film) calls her by her proper name Katerina and worries about her non-stop. Much of this is due to an illness Kate had the previous year which we don't get details on until later. When all of her friends boot her out Kate has no choice but to return home to live.Then one day something happens. She sees an attractive young man outside the shop looking up at the sky. Going out to see what he's looking at, he points out a bird to her claiming it's unusual to see this bird in the city. They talk a bit and he convinces her to walk with him later. Doing so he shows her a small alley, giving her the history of it and showing that it ends up in a small garden courtyard with benches that people can sit on.Kate becomes infatuated with the man who she learns is named Tom (Henry Golding). He tells her he works late nights but before he goes to work they continue to spend time together. One place he lets her know he works is a mission for homeless people. When Tom doesn't show one night, she goes there looking for him only to be recruited into helping.The relationship between Tom and Kate builds as the movie progresses but they never sleep together. He tells her he's old fashioned like that. As they spend time together things begin to change for Kate. She becomes happier. She becomes less selfish. She starts helping other people, especially at the homeless shelter. But will that happiness carry on? Will Tom be there for her forever? Will something happen that changes everything?In spite of revealing a lot of what takes place in the film so far I'm holding back on much of it. That's because this movie did something that so few do for me these days. It surprised me. It caught me off guard. I've seen so many movies that rarely happens and when it does it make me happy to see that this is still possible.The surprise is not all that makes me recommend this movie. It has a bright, fresh feeling to it in spite of the life that Kate lives when we first meet her. The film doesn't rely on naked bodies or four letter words to present a story of two people in love unlike most films today. Instead it harkens back to the romantic screwball comedies of the past relying on witty writing, great performances and a story that captures the heart.Clarke is known mostly for her role in GAME OF THRONES but shows that she has so much potential to move past that into Sandra Bullock territory, a romantic lead with the ability to make you laugh as well. Golding is a surprise, having only been in six films to far, his first being CRAZY RICH ASIANS where he did an amazing job as well. Thompson is hilarious here as an immigrant fearful of everything and concerned for her children.As I said at the start, I had no interest in this movie when it was released. I not admit that the film was a charming, refreshing change of pace that will entertain, enlighten and make you think twice about the world we live in. With music obviously written by the late George Michael used throughout, it's a movie that you should watch, in spite of Christmas having come and gone.",Last Christmas

Clarke is the atypical misanthrope who loves drink a bit much, is on the last legs w/her friends as far as favors are concerned & the only job she can hold is at a PartyCity-esque shop which is Christmas themed where she sells tragic yuletide trinkets dressed up as an elf & gets no respect from her boss (Michelle Yeoh co-starring w/Golding again after last year's monster hit Crazy Rich Asians). Just when you think things can get any worse for her, she meets a guy who shows her the error in her ways where she slowly but surely begins to turn a page & make herself a better human being & yada, yada, yada. Not working as a straight rom-com or a twisty fable (which when it comes loses any audiences who've tuned in for the love story bromides).

Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding are by far the standouts in the film, providing some truly great chemistry and poignant performances in the film. The acting is just one surprise of many in the film, as it is often clever with it's writing and progression of the story taken forward. The film does have a bit of an issue with editing, but nothing that ruins the film in a whole. It also is a bit corny and formulaic at times, providing typical tropes seen in movies of a similar nature, that just feel out of place, and if not, just plan obvious. However, the film is able to turn itself around from these remarks and become something truly special, and by all means heartwarming. The film is purely enjoyable, at times surprisingly inspiring, and full of an absolutely wonderful soundtrack of tunes from the legendary George Michael. In the end, Last Christmas surpassed my expectations on every account, and proves to be more than just a christmas romance film in all the right ways.

38,rgkarim,Will This Holiday Movie Give You It's Heart? Last Christmas Review,7,9 November 2019,"There is always something about the Christmas time of the year that brings out the good will in movies. Somehow the monotonous television specials, the move theaters itself, and even the atmosphere are all given a renewed glow that seems to lighten us up. Yet, in a flooded market trying to capitalize on the big time of the season, we can sometimes get things crammed in that don't need to be crammed in. So in November at this early stage of the holiday months, getting a Christmas movie makes me wonder how the quality of the film will be if coming out this early. As always, Robbie K coming in to give you his thoughts on whether or not the movie will match what the trailers suggested it would be. As such, let's get started as I take a look into:Movie: Last Christmas (2019)
LIKES:Good Acting
Comedy That is Not Overdone
Fun and A good atmosphere
Good Message For The Times
Fast Run Time
The MusicDISLIKES:Predictable
Dryer Sense Of Humor Required
Needing More Time To Tell A Detailed Story
The Semi-Superficial Romance
The Overdone Ending
Lacking That Big Punch
SUMMARY:Let's face it, I was not the most excited seeing the trailer for this film, but I was hoping that there would be some Christmas magic to assist with bringing it to life. Well my wish came true in the form of acting, with all the leads making for an entertaining, dysfunctional group. Emelia Clark was of course my favorite, especially taking center stage, bringing the roundabout character of Kate! Henry Goulding's charm works to offset the theatrics of the supposed messy character, his calm level headedness bringing its own magic that lvies up to the theme of the movie. And as for Emma Thompson, well another new light for the woman who wears so many faces. Outside of the quaint characters with major flaws, Last Christmas attempts to find the means of being different while still sticking to its guns from the trailer. For those looking for a typical American based comedy, you're in for a surprise as the movie turns to British roots for a comedy style that is a bit drier and catered to a more finite audience. Despite not being the comedy line craziness that most are expecting, the movie maintains a fun atmosphere, capturing the meaning of the season and sort of infecting you in the Kate's journey with this strange man. This atmosphere of feeling good compliments all the previous mentioned likes and somehow gave me some energy to stay immersed in the film. Of course a Christmas movie has to have a good message right? Well, Last Christmas delivers its morale laden plot right in your face and manages to keep the time honored tradition in line with the movie without being too cheesy or over the top. Yet for me, the music is the key to why I had fun. Last Christmas does not saturate in the Christmas themes, but instead blends both traditional songs with some other tracks to keep things lighthearted and in rhythm with the messages. If all of this does not sound good and you are being forced to go on a date, the fast run time should keep you satiated and not lose too many minutes of your life.So let's get into things that people will most likely not like or expect. First off the movie is predictable. A fine attempt at a twist, I had the surprise figured out well before stepping foot into the movie (yes the trailers were that obvious). It's a fine attempt, but the bread crumbs were a little too traditional so I can't say I was moved like many of my fellow audience members. As stated earlier, you need to have a drier sense of humor, and while I appreciated the wit, at times a nice wet joke sequence could have helped lighten the mood a little more. Thus again, be warned this is not your average rom-com. While the time limit may be beneficial in terms of getting out of there, it also limited the detailed story I think most were looking for. Last Christmas held potential to balance all these elements it wanted, but like much of today's trends the stories were sort of rushed and irrelevant plot points were hastily tied up when not needing to be included. This included the semi-superficial romance that while cute and endearing at the beginning was also not the romance aspect I expected they would go, (there are many Hallmark movies that do better than this one). Again its sincere and a bit more sentimental, but it needed more time to get the full effect for me. When the ending does finally arrive, it finds almost the perfect place to stop, but then like the ending of Return of The King, the movie goes one step too far to show how things are going to be okay. This ending montage approach is nice to show the future, but about five minutes earlier would have been better for me. Finally, I think the thing most are hating is that the movie is lacking a big punch that Christmas movies need for the theater visit. This movie sort of lacks that and I think from some of the thing said by fellow audience members, I have to agree that it needs that final ounce of oomph to get to gold star status.The VERDICT:What you see in the trailer of Last Christmas is almost what you get with this film. The cast shows good chemistry and brings their bag of tricks to the mix to make for a fun cast of characters that I think will charm most. It's nice that a Christmas comedy managed to still have heart and fun, not overdoing the humor and giving me a film that had good life lessons and positive atmosphere to enjoy, with a fun accompanying sountrack. Still, the movie fails for me in terms of bringing that big Christmas punch that I expect from these films, suffering from superficial gimmicks, semi complete story lines, drier humor, and a relationship that is sentimental but not what I thought it would be. Overall, the movie is enjoyable with a group, but I think it would find a better home on Hallmark or a local streaming. However, if you are looking for a feel good Christmas movie this early, check this one out.My scores for its genre are:Christmast/Comedy/Drama/Romance: 8.0
Movie Overall: 5.5",Last Christmas
39,rannynm,Entertaining Christmas Themed Musical With Thoughtful Performances,6,12 November 2019,"Last Christmas is a Christmas tale with an out-of-place musical hook that works better than it should. For a film that hinges much of its story on a single Christmas song, I found myself unexpectedly moved by it. It has a touching story about doing good for others, which we're all capable of, and not letting hardship keep you from reaching your full potential.Kate (Emilia Clarke) finds her life at a standstill, mostly homeless and frequently drunk with a loss of ambition or drive. She is about to get fired from her job as an elf at a Christmas-themed store when she meets the jovial, yet mysterious Tom (Henry Golding), who helps usher her into a new era of her life. Kate begins to help those she has done wrong and view the world in a more positive light as the Christmas holiday draws near.Emilia Clarke gives a surprisingly layered performance as Kate. Her character is written fairly blandly, but Clark gives it depth when the screenplay doesn't. Henry Golding plays Tom with exuberance and energy. His thoughtful approach to life makes him a nice foil to Kate's blatant cynicism. Emma Thompson puts on a Slavic accent in a scene-stealing comedic performance as Kate's painfully honest and worrisome mother. There are some moments in this film that are painfully reminiscent of other films in the rom-com lexicon, but there's a consistent charm here throughout, more earnest than contrived. This charm is amplified by the likability of its two leads, Clarke and Golding.The film's sound tracked is from the music catalog of singer George Michael. They serve as smooth transition between scenes, but at times feel tacked-on and gimmicky and don't fit in with the rest of the film. Last Christmas has a third act that turns the movie on its head and, while the shift isn't shockingly surprising, it's well-executed and re-contextualizes much of what has come before.I give Last Christmas 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 11 to 18 due to sexual references and language. There's nothing too scandalous, but it's still worth noting. If you're a fan of this genre, you'll probably love this film and its holiday charm is hard to resist. In the end, we go to the movies to be entertained and in that respect; Last Christmas certainly gets the job done.Reviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

40,nancyldraper,Star Powered,6,9 November 2019,"An interesting premise (thank you, Emma Thompson) but the story was really poorly developed. The first part is chaotic which robs the audience of finding in the characters an emotional centre to which we could relate, then, when we were just beginning to get beneath the tangle that is Kate, the whole movie changes. Fantastic cast: Emilia Clark brought her quirky energy to a fractured character we really wanted to like (no frosty queen of fire and ice here); Henry Golding, tender yet mercurial (and hunky, of course); Michelle Yeoh, always a consummate performer; Emma Thompson, always splendid in her self deprecating, idiosyncratic roles. Eventually, all the performers found some footing, and for that I give the film a 6 (fair) out of 10. Oh, yes, and should I mention that the soundtrack is George Michael and WHAM saturated? Well, I guess I just did! Last Christmas, the song that is at the heart of the film (excerpted five times) is finally performed with great skill by Emilia Clark (what can't she do?). {Holiday RomCom/RomDram}",Last Christmas
41,tomsview,Magic in the mix,9,9 January 2021,"I think this is the most captivating Christmas movie since ""The Bishop's Wife"" and ""Miracle on 34th Street"".It just takes a while to realise it.Kate (Emilia Clarke) is beautiful and likeable, but she's too self-focussed, which tends to make her careless, testing the tolerance of friends and family. When she meets Tom (Henry Golding), a young man who comes and goes, she is challenged to become a better person and turn her life around. Eventually we find out how and why.The backdrop is London at Christmas and among the Christmas lights and pre-COVID streets packed with shoppers we get George Michael songs, Eastern Orthodox church services; lines of homeless waiting in the cold; an over-the top Christmas gift shop where Kate works dressed as an elf; and Kate's overly clinging mother, Petra, played by Emma Thompson going to town on her ""Former Yugoslavia"" accent.There is almost too much happening. I wondered how it would all come together. However it does and finishes on a high. Luckily, I hadn't seen any spoilers and didn't see it coming - I definitely got my money's worth.Topping the whole thing off like the brightest star on the Christmas tree is Emilia Clarke. There is no shortage of brilliant, beautiful British actresses who also shine on countless talk shows. However, none have ever outshone Emilia Clarke.""Game of Thrones"" is one thing, but the real phenomenon is how much fun she has generated talking about it and every other aspect of her life to people like Ellen DeGeneres, David Letterman, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel and especially Graham Norton, who has the rare knack of eliciting revelations about sex scenes and embarrassing moments without seeming sleazy.Emilia has discovered the charm of self-deprecating wit; she can tell a story against herself. Anyway, whenever she's lost for words, she has that infectious laugh and those amazing eyebrows - not only that, she can sing!She lights up the screen from the moment she appears. The combination of Emilia Clarke with good-looking, uber-charming Henry Golding gives ""Last Christmas"" a touch of magic.There are plenty of Christmas movies, literally hundreds, but there are only a few that are perennial classics. I think ""Last Christmas"" is destined to be one of them.",Last Christmas
42,krocheav,Last Christmas - Lost Christmas,4,4 August 2020,"Amazing how many people still line up to see Christmas movies. This one is yet another of those so-called Christmas 'holiday season 'movies that are as much about Christmas as that Bonny Bouncing Bunny is to Easter. It's somewhat of a 'La La Land' wanna-be, without the easygoing feel and charm that one at least offered.Some of the dialogue and situations are crass and the sleep-around 'Christmas Elf'' didn't help whatsoever. The sudden turn to being a supernatural feel good/bad fantasy surprise --was a bit of a difficult twist to take-- especially amongst all the rather superficial PC philosophising being shovelled around like the fake 'santa' snow in the gutters of ole London. The cast tried but with the sour- treacle script reaching for heights it didn't quite earn, it was mostly uphill.Maybe fine for the easily pleased or woke 'idealists'.

47,kz917-1,Enjoyable..,6,8 March 2020,Pleasant film coupled with a good majority of the George Michael discography.The music has me bopping my head & singing along.The story at some point becomes obvious as to what the ending will be.

48,rockman182,Last Christmas(2019),6,12 November 2019,"Bring on the Christmas movies. It is officially the holiday season so of course we are going to get some festive themed films. I actually forgot that Paul Feig was the director of this. He's a fairly good filmmaker and I like his work for the most part. I also wanted to see Emilia Clarke take a lead role where she could dabble in comedy. Also, the film features songs by George Michael which felt kind of weird to me just because the music is just kind of there and not strongly linked to the story.I thought the film was decent, entertaining when it needs to be but it goes through predictable cliches.The film is about a woman who is going through a bit of a crisis in London during the holiday season. She's at odds with her family, has no place to stay, has trouble going on at work, and is a former singer who is struggling to find her break. She one day meets a mysteriously charming man who enables her to appreciate the spirit of giving and also the enchanting world that they live in. The two soon form a very close connection although she strives to get closer to the man, although it seems impossible.Emma Thompson as a Yugoslavian mother is on point and funny. There is good humor around the film and a lot of the entertainment in this film can be attributed to the charm and spirit that Emilia Clarke brings. I don't think she always acts well as Daenarys Targarean on Game of Thrones but she had this role figured out. The music of George Michael is nice I guess although to me it seems more random than a tribute to him.I think the films major third act is predictable early on and I kind of saw the events coming. Not that it wasn't done well, there just wasn't really a shock factor to events that transpire because it seems quite obvious a little of the way through. The film brings the Christmas cheers and holiday emotions in droves though and this can became a holiday time favorite for many.6/10",Last Christmas
49,jon.h.ochiai,"Look up in ""Last Christmas""",8,11 November 2019,"Speaking on stage before an audience, much like us, cute radiant Emilia Clarke as Kate, dressed in Elf green, says, ""We are so lucky to be alive..."" Well, Kate would know. In 1999 she and her family, including Mom Petra, played by Emma Thompson, immigrated to London from war-torn Yugoslavia. A couple years ago Kate had surgery to literally fix her broken heart. That's the unexpected back narrative of Director Paul Feig's ""Last Christmas"", his romantic comedy from the screenplay by Emma Thompson and Bryony Kimmings.Following her recovery from tragedy, Kate, who's an aspiring singer and huge fan of George Michael, like I am, lives her uninspired life. She has meaningless relationships with dudes, she meets in bars. She eats crappy food. Kate often finds herself homeless, sans flat-mate, because of her unaccountability.Hilarious beautiful Michelle Yeoh plays Santa (not her real name), who owns the year-round Christmas gift shop in London. Santa hires Kate to work in her shop, hence the Elf motif. As Thomas Hardy said, ""Character is Fate."" That's Kate. Santa grants her one final reprieve. Michelle tearfully says, ""But it's like you don't care anymore..."" Ironically, Michelle's Santa cares. Deep down Emilia's Kate does, too.One day outside the shop, Kate meets enigmatic charming handsome Tom, played by Henry Golding. Hysterically, both admit: They're not their 'type'. Their fate is entirely telegraphed miles away.Yet, in the touching narrative arc of ""Last Christmas"" Kate confesses to Tom, that she was ""really sick"". She's better now, but she feels that part of herself is literally gone. She says, ""I'm just scared all the time."" And that people expect her to be ""normal"". Tom wisely says, ""There's no such thing as 'normal'. It's just being a human being is hard..."" Amen, that can be hard.In the movie, Tom always tells Kate, ""Look up."" Perhaps, that's opposed to looking down, looking in the past. Look forward to life.That being all said, I really liked Paul's ""Last Christmas"". It does take the surprising narrative turn that I didn't entirely expect, although it remains poignantly human. Emma wrote ""Last Christmas"" based on the Wham! song written by pop icon George Michael. ""Last Christmas"" - the movie, features many George Michael songs, including ""Freedom 90"" which holds personal meaning for the story and for me. George's ""Freedom 90"" was his anthem for freedom, freedom that he didn't experience most of his adult life, something I can relate to. That kind of freedom is what Emilia's Kate discovers in herself.Yeah, Emma and Bryony's screen narrative could have been better. It's often misguided. Emma's own character Petra is nearly caricature in Slavic accent as the worried Mother of Kate and her younger sister Marta, played by believably sullen Lydia Leonard. Although, favorite Kate works in a Christmas Shop, Marta is the rising star attorney. Yet, Marta hasn't told her parents: She's gay.Michelle's wry maternal affection for Kate is the genuine savior of ""Last Christmas"". However, introducing her goofy romantic interest in Scandinavian 'Boy', played funny Peter Mygind, occurs forced. Checking one of the romantic comedy boxes.Still ""Last Christmas"" works because of the eloquent partnership of Emilia and Henry. Emilia's authentic self-awareness, albeit in a comic narrative, is inspired. Her Kate suffers over feeling broken, and fears that feeling might never go away. In Henry's calm easy presence as Tom, she sees perhaps, hope. Her Kate says, ""I didn't heal my heart just to give it away, and have it broken, again."" That lands. It's more than just some Wham! Christmas song lyric.After all: ""We are all so lucky to be alive."" That also personally landed for me. A friend of mine apparently didn't feel that, and ended his life. Yes, there shall always be suffering the world, particularly when living in silence. Yet, that suffering is finite. Sadly, my friend didn't see life as the gift worth living for.So although, ""Last Christmas"" might be flawed at times, its heart is in the right space. Paul, Emilia, Henry, and Michelle give their best, they give their hearts. Emma is absolutely right: ""We're so lucky to be alive."" As Tom says, ""Look up."" Look forward to life. Just saying.",Last Christmas
50,RforFilm,"Last Christmas, it'll give you plenty of heart, but the very next day, it may be a tad predictable",6,11 November 2019,"It's the middle of November and I know what a lot of people have on their mind; Christmas, right? The TV channels are already airing a lot of the typical Christmas movies and the shops are all decked out for the season. Of course we still have Thanksgiving to get through, but it's perfectly understandable if you're a bit annoyed by the over-commercialization of the season. That might make you a Grinch or a Scrooge, but you also don't care. I would completely understand that as I wish everything would at least wait until after the food coma has set in from Thanksgiving, but I also understand from a business point of view.When I was on my way to the movies, I overheard ""Last Christmas"" on the radio and thought to analyze it. It's not one of my favorite songs, but its one that happens to play every year (perhaps more due to the unfortunate death of George Michael). I think it's because of two things; first is the love story. The lyrics talk about a person getting a new chance to love but they deny it. Second is the synth sound that's both distinctly 1980's and is rarely heard in Christmas music. Now we have a song adaptation with Last Christmas because... I can't quite spoil it.Young woman Kate (played by Emilia Clarke) is stuck in a rut, as she continually loses a place to stay and doesn't want to go home to her parents. She's also loose with men as she doesn't want something to commit to. Her only stable thing is her job, in which she works at a year round Christmas shop run by ""Santa"" (played by Michelle Yeoh). Despite her aspiring singing career, she seems to have no push or motivation to move beyond the Christmas shop, considering that she's also becoming lazier on the job.While working, she comes across an odd man Tom (played by Henry Golding) who seems to be coming into her life more and more. At first she tries to push him away, but seems to start liking him quirk and how he seems to try to get her to do better. At the same time, after getting thrown out once more, she finally goes home where her parents berate her with more medical appointments from a heart condition and her countries traditions from Yugoslavia. Perhaps this Christmas, she may find more heart to give.Last Christmas has been marketing itself as a romantic comedy a lot like those Hallmark movies...and that seems about right. That isn't to say that this is a bad movie, but the trailer is likely the best place to figure out if your going to like this movie or not. It has a similar story, similar kind of acting, and same kind of music. There's even a similar plot twist that I will not give away, but let's just say that it makes Last Christmas a literal adaptation of the Wham song.If I'm gonna offer phrase, it's the script and it's actors. Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding do have a lot of chemistry and I was never board with their scenes. They make a lot of banter that a lot of young couples do (especially in Christmas shops, like in one scene). Though I was afraid, I also got into Michelle Yeoh's story of her running a Christmas shop and a potential suitor. It's clear that writer Emma Thompson and director Paul Feig (Bridesmaids, A Simple Favor) know how to write comedy and even nice scenes with couples. Character is clearly the first thing forward.As I said, there is a twist that happens in Last Christmas that will either make or break it. In my case, I thought it was fine as it adds needed weight for the main character. This is typical for a lot of holiday romance stories and I think this is what Paul Feig had wanted to make; an edgier version of those Hallmark movies. If this doesn't appeal to you, then your not going to like this. But if it doesn't bother you, you may be very forgiving of it's predictable nature as it's still an easy sit.I'll give this six Last Christmas albums out of ten. While I don't know if this is going to be another Christmas classic, it's inoffensive enough that it'll still play around the holidays for a while. It'll put you in the right mood for the holiday. Just be willing to be okay with the slower aspects. Check it out to see if you'd recommend the very next day.",Last Christmas
51,eminkl,"Trite and insincere, ""Last Christmas"" is a cloying cup of holiday sneer.",4,10 November 2019,"""Last Christmas"" would be a major hit on Netflix and LIfetime without the A-list ensemble or top-shelf boss. But this romantic comedy is a subpar experience as a cinematic element, where aspirations are naturally lower. ""Last Christmas"" is so candy sweet that even the most optimistic of Santa's Elves will leave a bad taste in the mouth. ""Game of Thrones"" actress Emilia Clarke plays Kate, a twenty-something reckless woman who works in a London seasonal store run by a woman who goes by Santa (Michelle Yeoh). Santa respects Kate as an employee but has recently taken its toll on Kate's growing cynicism and self-destructive behaviour. A fun montage reveals that Kate and most of her peers have burned bridges. And make matters worse, a medical problem cut off Kate's singing career. But when she meets Tom (Henry Golding), the kind and considerate, Kate's prospects start looking up. The highlight of the film is the performance of Emma Thompson as Kate's daughter, Adelia (Emma Thompson), a Yugoslav immigrant who is overly protective. Thompson, who is co-writing here, saves for herself all the best jokes. She puts on a thick accent and has an excellent comic timing. The rest of the picture is tonally distorted, synthetic, and lazy flat-out. Those who demonized ""Green Book"" last year's Oscar winner could also easily send their rage on ""Last Christmas."" Part of the narrative is about the work of Kate in a homeless shelter. You will instantly recognize the artificial essence of the one depicted here if you have ever visited or worked in one of these important places. Kate steps in as the facility's sort of savior. It's wince-inducing negatively. It's cinematic experience incapable of unsophisticated filmmaking. My wife and I have happily watched the latest Netflix Christmas deals for the last two holiday seasons. These cheesy films are lovely time-wasters. We put them on in my office last year while wrapping presents secretly, and these absurd films provided cheerful background noise. ""Last Christmas"" is better seen in that atmosphere, where you only sporadically concentrate on the film, enjoying the funny parts. But the cracks are magnified if you are forced to sit silently in a crowded theatre.",Last Christmas

53,Danusha_Goska,"Funny, Heartwarming, Profound",8,1 December 2019,"""Last Christmas"" is a funny, heartwarming, ultimately profound movie. It's being marketed as a romantic comedy but it's more of a dramedy. There are funny lines throughout, but ""Last Christmas"" deals with some tough issues, and towards the end it sends a beautiful message.Emma Thompson co-wrote the script. Thompson previously won an Academy Award for best adapted screenplay for ""Sense and Sensibility."" ""Last Christmas"" traffics in unflattering stereotypes of Eastern Europeans and it tries to hard to be politically correct, but its wit, warmth, and the chemistry of its stars, Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding, won me over.The movie opens in the former Yugoslavia, in an Orthodox church, of all places. Petra (Emma Thompson) is watching her daughter Katrina sing a George Michael song.Fast forward decades later, and move to London. Kate (Emilia Clarke) is an unlikable mess. She works as an elf / clerk in a year-round Christmas store run by Santa (Michelle Yeoh). Kate is homeless and couch surfs, sleeping with friends and one-night stands. She dresses in clothes that are a little bit slob and a little bit tramp. She's hard to like.One day she looks out the window of her Christmas store and sees Tom (Henry Golding.) He's a very nice guy. Charming, handsome, and kind. Kate is suspicious.Eventually Kate and Tom get close enough that Kate confesses her dark secret to him. She had been ill for a long time. Her mother seemed to enjoy too much having a chronically ill daughter, so Kate had to move out of the house. A year earlier, Kate had had a heart transplant, and she hasn't felt like herself since. Tom encourages Kate to get her life together.Kate returns to her natal family, now living in London. Petra, Kate's mother, is a stereotypical Eastern European. She is always sad, she sings mournful songs, she uses outlandish curses - ""I will nail you to my p----"" - and she refers to a dessert brought by a gay guest as ""lesbian pudding.""The TV broadcasts coverage of Brexit protests and Petra bemoans that people dislike her because she is an immigrant. But she is a bigot herself, albeit a comical one. ""I blame the Poles,"" she says, about current anti-immigrant sentiment in the UK. All this is played for laughs. Otherwise, the movie bends over backward to be politically correct. Four relationships are highlighted in the film, and all four are biracial, and one is a lesbian couple. The one group this politically correct film recognizes it is okay to make fun of is Eastern Europeans. Even so, I loved the movie.There are no spoilers in this review, so I can't tell you how the movie handles Kate's transformation, from a total mess at the beginning of the film, to someone we can take to heart at the end, but I found the plot device to be quite poignant, and I left the theater with tears rolling down my face. The critics who have given this film a low score need to have their credentials revoked and their minds and hearts opened. Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding have terrific chemistry, and I'd love to see them reunite in a more traditional romantic comedy.",Last Christmas

And Henry Golding was fun.
I suggest watching other romantic comedies because I didn't laugh once or get attached to the characters. The ending sucked and made the whole movie feel stupid.",Last Christmas
55,bob-the-movie-man,"Alas, Christmas",4,25 November 2019,"Oh Dear! Now I wouldn't go as far as saying I had ""high hopes"" for this film, but as a real fan of the goo-fest that is ""Love Actually"" I at least thought this might fill some seasonal void in the run up to the festive season. ""Best Christmas film of the decade!!"" screams the marketing. Er... no.This review will be spoiler free.The plot: Kate (Emilia Clarke) is an immigrant from the former-Yugoslavia now living in London. She has a dead-end job working for ""Santa"" (Michelle Yeoh) in a Christmas shop in Covent Garden. She is perennially lubricated both with drink and other bodily fluids thanks to her hedonistic lifestyle. And she really likes George Michael.But life just seems vacuous and to have no purpose for her anymore. Her composure is not helped by her mother (Emma Thompson) constantly fussing about her health, since Kate has only recently recovered from a serious illness.Dropping into her life then comes Tom (Henry Golding). Smartly dressed and calmly reassuring, Tom seems to have the potential to start turning Kate's life around. But is she prepared to listen?There are startling similarities here with Phoebe Waller-Bridge's triumphant tribute to hedonistic 30-something sex-addicted females everywhere.... ""Fleabag"". Kate is similarly louche, hopping from bed to bed in a heartbeat. She has a dysfunctional family and - most strikingly - she has a particularly difficult relationship with her high-achieving sister. This is not helped by a remarkable similarity between the actress playing Marta (Lydia Leonard ) and Fleabag's Clare (Sian Clifford). But whereas Fleabag is both brilliantly written, heart-rending and hilarious, this simply is not.There were a total of two laughs in the movie for me. Period. Both were lines delivered by Emma Thompson, and if you've seen the film you probably know the ones. Now, I'm aware that Thompson co-wrote the script and she is, of course, a national acting treasure. But here the script is clunky and all of the ""comic"" scenes are so laboured and forced that they land like leaden weights.And some of it makes no sense whatsoever. There is some strange Danish sauerkraut salesman (Peter Mygind) with a crush on ""Santa"". He suddenly appears in the shop acting like some escaped mental patient. When he first appears, acting bizarrely, you think, ""oh, there must be some fascinating backstory between these two - a murky past they are trying to rekindle"". But no! This is the first time they have EVER met? It's completely bonkers!Much was made of this being Michelle Yeoh's ""first comedy"". Sorry, but if she proves anything here it is that she is not a comic actress.Emilia Clarke is still looking to land in a decent mainstream role outside ""Game of Thrones"", after a failed Terminator sequel, a half-decent weepie (""Me Before You"") and the commercial failure that was ""Solo"". Here she certainly looks curvaciously cute as the Christmas elf. But unfortunately cute can't save her from the car-crash of a script.Similarly Henry Golding is well-dressed eye-candy for the ladies, almost doing a re-tread of his cool and laid-back character from the excellent ""Crazy Rich Asians"". Without the same need to be ""zany"", he fairs slightly better from the script. But again, this feels like one to shuffle into a quiet corner of his CV.What can I say that's even remotely good about this? Three things:1) London. It looks glorious, decked out in lights like some chocolate-box-cover cum tourist-board publicity shot. London is one of the most photogenic cities on the planet, and I could relate to Tom's mantra to ""look up"" and see all of the architectural quirks and foibles that exist around every corner in that wonderful city;
2) The payoff. Exactly when you get the payoff will depend on how much you know going in (if you've managed to avoid the trailer... continue to avoid it!) and how attentive you are. There's an ""aha!"" moment. And it's nicely played out.
3) There's a topical xenophobic Brexit angle, that's a little clumsy in the exposition but - in my view - is good for the telling.This is a movie desperately trying to blend ""Love Actually"" with another Christmas classic (no... not ""Die Hard""... but to say more would introduce spoilers!) But in my view it misses badly.The director is Paul Feig, famous for ""Bridesmaids"" and ""Spy"" and infamous for the female ""Ghostbusters"" reboot.There are clearly lovers of this film. At the time of writing it has made an impressive $51M on its $25M budget.

I'm a big Emma Thompson fan, but she's embarrassing herself here in her dual role as scriptwriter/actress. The script was as loose as watery jello, going everywhere and nowhere at once. Her imitation of a Yugoslavian mother was cringeworthy. You could almost think director Paul Feig felt the same way of how bad things were by punching in a pedestrian, plodding camera placements hampered by unnecessary quick cross-cutting editing.

Kate of course played by Emilia Clarke would have to have deep psychological problems after bringing up 2 dragons and conquering 3 Kingdoms in Game of Thrones and she is a very versatile actress and good in comedy.I'm sure Last Christmas was a welcome and refreshing change from her Mother of Dragons past but as lovely as she is in this movie I just felt that her role was too large for a movie where she is rarely off screen and at times was irritating.I also enjoyed fellow Crazy Rich Asian star Henry Golding not being rude but his part could have been larger that's one problem I had too much Emilia and not enough of the good supporting roles.I would have liked more development of the other characters especially Michelle Yeoh and Kate's sister Maria ,one of the best scenes is the whole family reunited together and Mother Petra singing and I must find out her recipe for Lesbian Pudding.Emma Thompson wrote the story and screenplay and she is a very accomplished writer with The Further Tales of Peter Rabbit and Nanny McFee and Last Christmas has moments of great fun ,romance and sentimentality but not in the league of other British romantic comedies like Pride, Finding Yourself, Love Actually Notting Hill or Bridget Jones .I did like the surprise conclusion I wasn't expecting it quite clever and you'll have to see the movie to find out.I'm sure Last Christmas will get some negative reviews from critics and audiences too but if you like British contemporary comedy romance as opposed to American rom-com in your face brashness and I do you'll probably like this heartwarming average but well produced movie.",Last Christmas

I don't think I absolutely love a film from this genre, and if I do, it probably doesn't solely belong to the rom-com's list (they could also be musicals, dramas, etc). Most of the times, I appreciate them enough to feel fulfilled. Very rarely, I feel totally disappointed or with a hate feeling towards one. Paul Feig delivered a couple of great comedies during his career (Bridesmaids, Spy), and the underrated/overlooked A Simple Favor, which I enjoyed very much. With Emma Thompson (Adelia) as both supporting actress and screenwriter, Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding as protagonists, Last Christmas grew on me in the week of its premiere, making me genuinely excited for its session.This Christmas' movie sort of falls in the middle. I don't exactly ""like"" it that much, but I still left the theater happy and reasonably entertained. It actually possesses a dramatic tone deep within, but it never fully explores it, maintaining the lighthearted and festive vibe throughout most of its runtime. Clarke and Golding share amazing chemistry, and their scenes are very romantic, sweet, and emotional. However, it's more of the same. Last Christmas doesn't bring anything new since it follows the same cliches every other rom-com does.Its only bold and different take on the story is a plot twist that raises too many logical questions. Instead of carrying an emotionally powerful impact, it merely delivers an initial shock that goes away once people start to really think about it. Nevertheless, I praise this storytelling choice. It's never easy to pull off a twist, but the truth is that if Emma Thompson and Bryony Kimmings didn't take this missed shot, I wouldn't have spent the whole trip back home thinking about the film. I would have probably forgotten it as soon as I got into the car. So, congrats on trying something different, even if it didn't quite work for me.Thompson ultimately shines as Kate's mom, though. No missteps here. She's hilarious, and she has some of the funniest lines of the whole thing. Michelle Yeoh (Santa) also has a couple of fun moments, but her subplot feels a bit strained. Emilia Clarke incorporates the clumsiness and awkwardness of her character seamlessly. If you're familiar with Clarke's interviews and public persona, then you know that Kate is basically the over-the-top reflection of Clarke. Despite her lack of luck, she's still charming and a good person that went through a traumatic event that changed her life (duh). Golding is glamorous and perfect as expected, especially since his character needed precisely these attributes.Their relationship grows in a not-so-realistic way, and while this might be justified by the last act's twist, other plot points are not. My main issue with the movie is really those last 20 minutes. In addition to the twist, every single subplot is closed like nothing happened. From a particular family situation regarding sexual orientation to Yeoh's entire side story, all are either solved off-screen or way too easily. It's a rollercoaster of good and bad writing decisions. It has a couple of exciting downwards slopes and tight turns, but most of it is a slow ride with nothing truly thrilling or astonishing.Last Christmas tries to be ""the next big thing"" concerning Christmas classics, but it falls short of its goal. Boasting a fantastic cast, with two charming, compelling leads in Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding, Paul Feig delivers a lighthearted, festive film, but stuffed with cliches and a twist that doesn't quite work. Emma Thompson shines as a supporting character but has some missteps in co-writing the story with Bryony Kimmings, showing significant struggles in tying up the loose threads left by the side stories. Despite its storytelling issues, it's a flick I recommend to anyone who loves seasonal movies with a beautiful message, some fun moments, and a score packed with our favorite George Michael's songs.",Last Christmas

It follows Kate, a young woman subscribed to bad decisions. Working as an elf in a year round Christmas store is not good for the wannabe singer. However, she meets Tom there. Her life takes a new turn from there. Not gonna lie, I actually wanted to see it. It looked cute and all, but with a writer like Emma Thompson I really wanted to see it. I ended up seeing this later due to time constraints and the mixed reviews. Last Christmas is an enjoyable rom com, don't get me wrong. I found myself smiling throughout. The script is heartwarming and there are some funny moments. The cast does really with those two aspects. Emilia Clarke does a good job in this. She's humorous and just watching her life fall apart with her poor decision making is pretty entertaining. Then when Henry Goulding comes in, his character is likable and is helping her through everything. There's a plot point where he isn't around all the time, which I understand why he isn't there; it's to help her realize she doesn't need him all the time. The problem though was that at those points it felt a little empty, so they did kind of need him in the story. That part though kind of makes sense towards the end, but I'll get to that later. Emma Thompson does also star in the movie as Clarke's mother and she does a good job as this traditional Ukrainian mother. It sort of confused me though that she was the only one with the accent in the family and no one else had any. Overall, enjoyable characters and an enjoyable movie. Now there's a choice made in the story towards the end. It's quite the plot twist and I felt very uncomfortable thinking about everything after that. That twist seems to be dividing critics and audiences alike. It didn't really work for me and I wish they had maybe not have done that. The more you think about it, the more it sort of makes sense, however I don't think it was the best choice. Last Christmas is a fine rom com to watch for an enjoyable time. There's nothing special to it, in my opinion, and a twist that really hurt it as a whole. I will warn that to whoever wants to see it.My Grade: B-",Last Christmas
67,ethanbresnett,"Not a Christmas classic, but still a very nice film!",7,10 December 2020,"I found Last Christmas a really enjoyable film! It's fun, sweet, charming, and has a great Christmassy vibe - which is exactly what you want from this sort of film.In most part this was due to Emilia Clarke. She is just so damn sweet and watchable. I absolutely love her in roles like this where she isn't all serious and brooding. Her personality really shone in this film and it was a joy to watch.Henry Golding was just as brilliant. His chemistry with Emilia was fantastic, and when they were on screen together was when the film was at its best.The story I actually thought was really good. I was hooked, and found myself really invested in the character of Kate. All of the characters were pretty well done I thought. The humour didn't always hit the mark for me, but that's a very subjective area so I'm not going to mark the film down too much because of this.This film is definitely worth watching. As mentioned, its just a really sweet film which is fun to watch. Give it a go!",Last Christmas

Had read some really negative reviews about this one.Emilla Clarke and Henry Golding wins my heart in this one.The story is simple yet very unusual. Kate(Emilla Clarke) is young woman who is known for her bad decision. She meets a mysterious man Tom(Henry Golding) who brings out the best in her.But the movie takes a turn. Tom is not what Kate thinks he is.What I liked about the movie is the simplicity and some of the tiny details I saw i this movie. The script is funny and touching at the same time. Cinematography is excellent. You will fall in love with London and the night cinematography is absoultely beautiful. Music compeltely gels with the visuals and story.The story and its execution would make you emotional, some people like me would even have tears in the eyes.Its's a really really well made movie and surely very underrated.",Last Christmas
69,akcenat,One of those Holiday fairy tale movies that you want to watch again,8,20 June 2020,"""Last Christmas"" isn't the best Holiday movie you'll see but, it's a fun time that will fill your heart and get you in the holiday spirit. It's also a perfect date night movie or if you need a holiday kick start. It's a film, too, that very much feels like the product of the 90s, but that's not exactly a bad thing. It uses this familiar approach to add a bit of relevancy, while also sending a positive message. Film benefits from charming performances and chemistry between Emilia Clarke & Henry Golding who shine here together. Memorable and heartfelt ""Last Christmas"" is one of those movies that's for sure will become as much of a holiday tradition to watch as baking up a batch of gingerbread cookies. Ultimately, it's far from perfect and there are plenty of logical leaps to make and ideas to buy into, yet it's delightfully heartwarming and sweetly entertaining when at its best.Rating: 8",Last Christmas

director: Paul Feige
starring: Emilia Clarke,Henry Goulding,Emma Thompson,Michelle Yeough,margaret clunie etcoverall rating 44/100Last christmas focuses on the character of Kate ( Emilia clarke) whos life is a mess with her having no place to stay and issues with her family. But when she bumps into Tom ( Henry Golding) at the christmas shop where she works her world is turned upside down a relationship is formed and she gets her life back on track but not everything is at it seems. I wanted to like Last christmas a lot more then what i did but i just couldn't get over the films flaws especially its terrible twist ending lets talk about this.Lets start off with the films great christmas aesthetic and its great soundtrack. The films visuals were charming and made you slightly christmasy which is what they were going for so this was executed well as you couldn't help but watch in or at all the lights and decoration,so i applaud Paul for making things that are so simple so beautiful. And second the films soundtrack was great. As it was called last christmas all the songs were by wham or George michael, And all the songs they chose were perfect and fitted with the overall tone of the film well.However two problems i had were how predictable it was and its pacing issues. I could predict most of the events from the movie, which made it get boring after a while. I could guess the jokes before they were executed and i could tell what was going to happen with Emilia's character. And the film was just slow and clunky for me. There was just a large majority of the film were either nothing exciting was happening or hardly anything was happening at all,which is a shame as this was one of the reasons why i didn't connect with the movie as much as i wanted to. Which proves my point that there just wasn't enough plot to justify its runtime.Next my favourite parts of the movie which largely held it all together was the fantastic performances from Henry Goulding and Emilia clarke. Henry Goulding did a very charming performance here and his character despite being slightly strange was very likeable. His romantic development between him and Emilia Clarke was fascinating and lovely to see. And for me definitly the best thing about this film was Emilia Clarke. She was fantastic here. She sold her serious moments. But also was hilarious,relatable and charming. And her development of being a better person and doing good was excellently executed.Next i thought the film had very random and not well thought out political statements and severe tonal issues. The film randomly decided to follow in some peoples negative attitudes to immigration and foreigners that felt rushed and didn't blend with the film at all. So this could of either been cut which would of been the better option as its a comedy or more fleshed out and developed. And the film had severe tonal issues. The film overelied on its humour so when it tried to be serious and emotional it didn't work as they added in a awkward joke to break the emotion. This made me lose connection with the film sadly.Next i thought the films humour mostly landed. I laughed a fair few times in this film especially from Emilia Clarkes charecter. So this kept the film good throughout the first half. However as the film went into its second half the humour for me went stale and got very repetitive. Michelle Yeoughs humour became flat. I could guess when people were going to make a joke or fall over and i just think the humour lost its creativity as the film went on which was a massive shame.Now my final big positive would be how heartwarming the tone was. Emilia and Henries relationship was very sweet as you could tell thats what kate needed in her life. And Kate rebuilding her life and reconnecting with her family whilst also doing some good at the homeless shelters gave us many scenes of joy which made your heart melt.But my biggest issue with the film which really hit the nail on the coffin for this film would be its terrible and cheesy plot twist at the end. This really annoyed me. It turned out that when Kate had a heart transplant it was Henry gouldings charecter who gave her his heart meaning he was dead during the whole film. Making his character not exist at all was a terrible decision . It made the film pointless and confusing and Made Emilia clarkes charecter completely insane. I get what they were going for with the song last christmas but i thought it was a cringey and terrible idea for a movie.Overall despite excellent performances and heartwarming moments that keep the film together. Last christmas gets slowly worse and worse as the film goes on and is completely ruined by its terrible ending.",Last Christmas

People are sometimes very critical of Love Actually but if you watch Last Christmas you see how good Love Actually is and how hard it is to make a good Rom Com or Christmas film.
I won't give any plot spoilers but it is surprises me how badly made this film is.
The plot looks good on paper but it does not convince on screen.
The whole thing is based on George Michael songs but they don't add much to the plot.
There are no good performances in this,and I write as an Emma Thompson fan.
But every film has its good points,the good things about this film is that it makes London look great.
This film makes Notting Hill look like a Ken Loach film.

At times the movie is bad and other times it's ok. The main flaw is the so called twist ending it's so obvious if they did a better job at bidding it it would of been better.

78,ayoreinf,How many characters do you really need in a Rom-Com ?,7,11 November 2019,"There's a problem with this rom-com. It's short of leading characters. I mean, Emilia Clarke, has a wonderful character written down for her, and she does wonders as Katerina/Kate the girl on the path of self distruction. But she needs a counter part. It's going with the territory, one must have two for a tango and for a rom-com. Problem is, they couldn't write a complete, flesh and blood character to stand against her, so in a manner of speaking they chose the easy way out. You'll have to see the film to understand what I mean, but once you do, I'm sure you'll see I'm right. And it's a big problem here. Since romcom, is the last bastion of male chauvinism in cinema. The last place where male is still the knight in shining armour coming to save his damsel in distress. If the male character is incomplete, flat, you've got a solo tango. And no matter how you turn it, what we've got here is a tango for one. It does have wonderful backup roles. Especially so with Michelle Yeoh, and with Emma Thomson who might be the only one playing this cartoon of a mother and still pulling it off. Everybody else in this movie is so very professional, but no matter what, we're short of a second lead and I'm not sure whether any actor could build a character in this case with the given source material.",Last Christmas
79,movieman6-413-929510,A too early romantic Christmas comedy with a predictable plot twist.,5,9 November 2019,"Last Christmas is a new romantic comedy directed by Paul Feig, the director of Bridesmaids, Spy and The Heat.The film is about the young Kate (Emilia Clarke), who has had a difficult period behind her back, which makes her now a bit more moody. For example, she works as a cherry elf in a Christmas shop, while she would prefer to earn her money as an independent singer or a singer in a Christmas choir. When she meets the mysterious boy named Tom (Henry Golding), her life seems to take a positive turn. Kate keeps on seeing Tom again and again and the chemistry between the two starts to grow, causing Kate to fall in love with Tom.This film is a somewhat early romantic Christmas comedy, which remains good for a long time with the story of the film. The film does contain a plot twist, but it is somewhat predictable. The twist first comes across in a beautiful way in the film. Unfortunately, the film is also filled with extra separate story lines that deal with the problems of other characters, for example, or political messages to make the film more up-to-date. Because of all these extra storylines, the film suddenly no longer seems to focus on the main story about the relationship between Kate and Tom. It would have been better if they could end this film a little earlier and leave out all these extra storylines for a better story and conclusion.The title of the film is based on the song of the same name by Wham !. This film is also filled with well-known songs from the band and others from lead singer George Michael. With all this music and other Christmas elements, they are trying to get you into a Christmas mood with this film, but we are only in the beginning of November. This makes these attempts to get you in the Christmas mood a bit too early. They should have released this film a month later in the cinemas.",Last Christmas

the movie now will fail at box office and anyways no matter how much it will make it would do double if it was released at least 1 month later.

I loved the music throughout, thank you George Michael! Emilia Clarke is super cute and I love her playing normal people. Henry Golding is just so handsome and I would have loved to see him in the film much more!! I hope he has more movies to come, he's so charming! Michelle Yeoh was also great, she shines in a comedic role. Great casting overall! So back to the plot... I will keep it spoiler free. The first half of the movie follows Kate (Clarke) in her mess of a life. Her self-centered downward spiral has left her basically homeless, in a dead-end job and almost no healthy relationships with people in her life. She meets Tom (Golding) who starts to open her eyes to things and places that are around her. Without giving anything away, I will say that the second half of the movie felt like it was done by a completely different person than the first half. Or like a scene or two had been cut? It was a little confusing how the pace and tone of the movie seemed to change and switch gears. There was very little plot in the second half and it didn't grab me emotionally. I was hoping to be truly touched at the end because the beginning started so strongly for me. There were a few too many subplots that didn't really go anywhere which made the film feel overstuffed yet still bare overall. I needed more emotional connection! It could have really been a slam dunk but it felt short for me. I'm giving it a 7 because I want romantic comedies to still be made but I need more!",Last Christmas
86,LukeCustomer2,Despised it.,4,11 November 2019,"I really like Emilia Clarke but she has to get a new agent. She carries this movie on her back. But it isn't enough to save it from the paper thin screenplay. Can we all just admit right now that Emma Thompson is just not that great a screenwriter? I mean sure if she is tweaking a great writer like Jane Austen she can do ok but on her own - very over rated.The movie concerns Kate a young woman who had a heart transplant last Christmas. Since that time she has been lost and making a series of poor decisions. Kate likes to sing but no one seems to want her to as they won't pay her to do it. In the meantime she works at a Christmas store. Kate meets Tom who is too good to be believed and somehow gets her to start making better decisions.Like a lot of Feig productions 30% of the screen play is ad libed. 3 sub plots are in this movie but seem to have none or little relation to it.In the end Kate is taking care of herself, happy and helping others... but the big question is why. No one convincingly wrote a story whereby we would really see why. All of that is just glossed over. Loving or liking someone else has zero relation to that.",Last Christmas

The two leads seem to have good chemistry with each other. I love Michelle Yeoh, but she seemed unnecessary in this movie. I guess they need more than one mother-figure who criticizes Kate/Katarina.
Unfortunately, the pleasantness has a twist. Not a good one either. It feels like the rug is pulled out from under the audience. The remainder of the film tries to bring a happier closure, but the damage is done. I understand the message it tries to bring, but being a Christmas movie, you kind of expect a more positive or happy ending. Perhaps if it wasn't set at Christmas time, the downer could be over looked. Or maybe there could have been a way to rescue the film. Unfortunately, while the twist was something different and unusual, it was like walking happily on a street, then falling down a sewer when you didn't know the manhole cover was missing.
If you want to see a cheerful Christmas movie, I'm not sure if this is the one for you. It's also a bit more sexually suggestive in language and content, so it's not a family movie.
Maybe somewhere down the line, someone could do a remake of this film, perhaps give it a better recovery from the depressing ending. So I give it a pass because it is a fairly good movie up to a certain point.",Last Christmas

90,lyubitelfilmov,The eccentric Emilia meets the ideal or My personal Oscar 2020 winner,9,12 February 2020,"Romantic comedy. The film was directed by Paul Fig, known to us for his disgusting behavior in one notorious social network, which removed the wild horror called ""Ghostbusters"" and Emilia Clark, the famous Daenerys Targaryen from the notorious series with a terrible end, became my interest. Frankly speaking - I was waiting for a prowler with a licked romantic line, but I got ... In general - it was worth going to the cinema for this, it is better with a girl, but I don't have one. Nevertheless, I decided to look - and this is just a WONDERFUL romantic picture. Emotions beat over the edge, therefore, I apologize in advance if there will be extra confusion and ""chewing snot"" in the text. Here is my brief opinion - my personal winner of the Oscar 2020! No more and no less, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen. I choke with delight when I write these lines, but the experienced look does not sleep, therefore I will paint both the advantages of this wonderful picture and the shortcomings that hurt the eye.
So, the advantages:
1. The song ""Last Christmas"" of the English group ""Wamp"", namely George Michael - it is the germ from which, like a tree, this wonderful picture grew. Before viewing the title of this song, it didn't give me anything, well, the song and the song, but as soon as it began to play at the beginning of the picture, I instantly remembered its chords and began to sing along to the heroes. Although the song is not new (it was written in the mid-eighties), it is recognizable all over the world. How I remembered it and where I first heard it is a big mystery to all of humanity. Maybe the reason is the simplicity of words or music!
2. London - I love this city (as you know), I love its cozy streets, large squares, famous monuments, right-hand drive cars. I hope that one day I will be able to visit this city and walk along these streets myself. All the action of the picture takes place in London, which I am incredibly happy.
3. Christmas atmosphere - what not to take away from this picture is precisely this. And it shows exactly the modern atmosphere with smartphones, selfies, a bunch of unnecessary gift junk that goes to the trash soon after the holiday, happy smiles on their faces, a feeling of warmth and care. Maybe the atmosphere was embellished, but still it blooms with bright colors here.
4. Humor - for the most part, he was good. He laughed heartily at some points.
5. A romantic story - it is beautiful, both with the main and secondary characters. Two people completely unlike each other fall in love. The standard reception of all the romantic comedies of all times and peoples, but here, which is the most surprising for me, is more or less chaste, just in the spirit of the old classics, like ""Roman Holidays"". Between the heroes, first quietly, like an obsession, then more and more the same ""spark"" arises that everyone can feel. Despite some wariness and some skepticism - I continued to look and in the end I was rewarded!
6. Shocking finale - this technique is not very often used in the paintings of this genre, because I experienced a real shock from the finale. I believed in the love of the heroes, I rejoiced with them, I tried not to pay attention to anything else, and here - blow, discharge, blow - and despair. Now I understood why it all happened, how could I not have guessed it myself?
So, the disadvantages are:
1. Gay and lesbianism - how I don't want to describe those moments because of which I did not give the highest mark to this wonderful picture, but I have to, because I really got it. I could now expand an entire article about how this whole ""talerastiya"" terribly infuriates me and why it is disgusting, terrible and the like. And immediately those who rummage over me with a moron, a homophobe, a freak and so on. I have already come to terms with this. All this is bad, and I do not need to write that the author of the wonderful song ""Last Christmas"" was gay, I know this, but the emu says goodbye, because he created a musical masterpiece. Tolerasts! You can attack, I do not care.
2. Some inconsistency - in the picture there are ""sagging"" both in central history and in secondary ones. What to do - alas, nothing perfect happens!
3. Rough physiological humor - in general, it is perfectly inscribed in history, this cannot be taken away, but sometimes it infuriates so much that there are no words.
A little about the main characters:
1. Kate, played by Emilia Clark, is an employee of a Christmas store with eternal problems, the appearance of a cheap prostitute and big ambitions, but behind all this masquerade she hides real pain and longing from a past in which a terrible thing happened. Her tricks amaze, amuse, make her worry, and after that - I just want to hug her, comfort her and kiss her. Emilia personally proved to me that she can play not only the mother of dragons, but also someone else. Her character turned out to be lively, extraordinary, funny and touching. From a closed egoist with kooky at the end, she turns into a kind and caring lady with an open heart and with a sense of joy from life. Amy's whole pen!
2. Tom performed by Henry Golding - a romantic young man whom Kate met. Veselchak, a madman in the good sense of the word, capable of melting all the ice in the North. Strongly influenced Kate, giving her guidance and instilled a love of life itself. This Malaysian came to my liking. Before that, I had never seen him in a movie, and I must admit - the debut turned out to be gorgeous. Well done!
I could have painted each of the heroes like that, but I've been writing this text for more than an hour, so I need to round out and summarize the final results.
If this picture is Paul Fig's apology for his past creation, then I accept it. Emilia! I thought you didn't know how to play, and more than once I saw confirmation of this, but with this picture you convinced me of the opposite. I don't believe that I'll write it now - but I was wrong! Forgive me!
As a result, we have a wonderful romantic comedy with an unexpectedly shocking ending, a wonderful Christmas atmosphere, wonderful music that could not do without cons. Emilia and Henry are a wonderful couple!
My rating is 9 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",Last Christmas

Some of the situations are a bit cliché, but I find helping the homeless and condemning an all-embracing 'go back where ya came from' hostility towards immigrants to be perfectly compatible with the spirit of Christmas.
Offsetting that, Emilia Clarke brings a very sharp and sometimes caustic wit to her lines, without ever losing touch with her thoroughly decent and rather sweet and vulnerable core.
The film shows how important it is to be able to laugh, at ourselves and at life, and to really appreciate what we have, because for all the failings of modern society we are nevertheless extremely privileged compared to those that have come before us.

95,RhapsodyReviews,Good Holiday Film.,7,1 December 2019,"Review:
'Last Christmas' is a romantic-comedy film directed by Paul Feig.
First things first, this is not your typical Holiday film. I would go as far as to say it's not one you have to strictly watch around Christmas time. The movie wants to be a romantic comedy at heart, and it pulls it off.
The film stars Emilia Clarke as a cynical Christmas store worker who forms a relationship with a mysterious man (Henry Golding) and begins to fall for him.
Emilia Clarke is a goddess send down from the heavens to be shown among the world. She was excellent in this movie and stole every scene she was in. Henry Golding was also good in his role of the film and he and Emilia Clarke had very good chemistry on screen. The side characters get kind of lost in translation throughout the film and are what I call 'throw away' characters. But, Emma Thompson as Emilia Clarke's mother brought most of the laughs and tears in this movie.
I enjoyed the story, but it was quite predictable. I don't know if it's because I've seen all Hollywood has to produce and nothing surprises me, or if it is the fault of the directing itself. From the beginning you can see where the movie is going, but it still didn't take away from the entertainment. Where I had a problem with, the movie was some of it's editing choices. I can't give any examples without giving spoilers, so I won't, but it has to do with the day to day routines of our main character.
Overall, the movie had laughs and heart which is was a romantic comedy needs to have, as well as likable characters. Also, what an amazing soundtrack! I thought it was going to be full of George Michael's songs just because of the title of the film; and it does have a lot of George Michael, but it makes sense. Go check this one out.

96,Padreviews,Tribute to Richard Curtis,10,15 November 2019,"16 years after the Christmas masterpiece LOVE ACTUALLY the directorial debut of Richard Curtis comes an equally exceptional film.I really hope no one gives out any spoilers here as this film blew me away .Take tissues you'll need them .There are so many positives but honestly if you like ROMCOMS you'll love this - think Four Weddings , Notting Hill etc - Emma Thompson , star or Love Actually wrote and directed this but you'll honestly believe it was Richard Curtis - it's got his style all over it .The locations chosen were amazing and the back story of Brexit and immigration were on point with the current politics . Emilia even looked like Rita Ora so the back story in some ways was uncanny with the former Yugoslavia playing a part . The use of London the integration , the beauty of us all sharing this earth together , looking after one another - people getting on regardless of class creed or colour all gave a positive feel about a film set at this time of year around family and acceptance of change .I don't want to say too much or any thing about the plot itself as it will spoil the film except to say I was blown away .See it before someone else does and spoils it for youTruly amazingPad.A 10/10",Last Christmas

98,SamPamBam,What to make of this Turkey?,1,21 July 2020,"Ok so, from the outset we know something is up...what that is, we have no clue, but we are led to believe this movie will eventually prove to be a cinematic effort with a bit of substance...
Oh hell no!
Tom is not quite right...something about him is just...fishy...
anyway, Emilia is pretty cute in a Elfish sort of way, Michelle Yeoh is worth watching, Emma T. has gotten playing the hag down pretty good, but overall, we realize, this thing is a very preachy social justice statement covering a broad range of left wing babbling talking points, and WELL before the end we are jsut fed up with it.
We stayed to the end, as we were just too lazy to switch it over to AccuWeather and see what the weather is going to be like in the High Desert tomorrow, which is infinetly more interesting than anything about this turkey.
Future Note to the woman in my life who watches movies based simply on the Title and does not bother to read a review or synopsis or see who wrote it or is in it: Get your own TV and don't touch my remote EVER again.
EVER!
Anything that the Hag known as Emma T is involved in is going to be a social justice statement and not entertaining at all.
At All.
Nuff Said.

I'm glad I did. At moments throughout the film, I felt what I felt when *I* was 26 - the good things, not the bad. I don't think any movie has brought that about before, for me. As someone in their 60s, that is simply wonderful to experience.
Emma Thompson surely has some magic :)
The cast is wonderful, across the board. Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding are very good together. Emma Thompson as her mother is delightful, as is Boris Isakovic as her father. Michelle Yeoh is marvelous, in a marvelous role.
I wish I'd watched this sooner, but had stayed away because of the bad reviews. I should know by now that that means nothing :) I've enjoyed lots of Christmas movies, even Elf has its moments, but the execution of this film is so deft, so spot on, that it is going to be one of my Christmas ""must watch"" films.",Last Christmas

Not funny.
The plot twist ending you can see a mile off.
Paul Feig seems to let the actors improvise all the comedic moments and then cram all the bits in the movie whether funny or not... just like Ghostbusters really, with the same boring cheesy outcome.

She's ashamed of her ancestry, lives recklessly with little regard for her health or safety and feels sorry for herself. I was so annoyed by her attitude then the big surprise comes and I was furious.

105,maximovlE,Frustrated,8,30 January 2020,"I love Emma Thompson. I adore Emilia Clarke. I really thought this movie would be amazing, but it wasn't. I don't know what it was that stopped it from being amazing, but I think they simply tried too hard. It's very pc, which is so boring. The comedy scenes didn't work, the police women were like a bad sketch from an 80s sit com and 'boy' was simply a cringe.There were some great parts, the relationship Emilia's character had with Santa was developing very nicely. The development of the personalities of some of the homeless people was warning... Although wasted because it went nowhere. The concept was excellent, it was just delivered a little, amateurishly.We all know Emma far too well for her to play a foreigner, I will never understand why this even happens, find a decent actor who is of the nationality you want to portray, it's so much more believable. She did a great job, but for me it just didn't work.I really hope Emilia gets some better roles. She's amazing, she really is. She's so utterly beautiful there are no words, her acting is phenomenal, and as a person, as far as I've seen in a plethora of interviews and TV appearances, she's perfect. I just don't want to see her disappear in bad movies.Overall, I can't call it excellent, I'll stick with very good... Lucky casting because without Emilia I think it would have been, quite frankly, pants.",Last Christmas
106,schroederagustavo,Thoughts on Last Christmas,3,13 April 2020,"On the surface and before I even saw Last Christmas, it appeared to me to be one of those easy-going romantic comedies that come out of the assembly line, especially during the holiday season. It isn't exactly that and that's actually one of the best things that I can actually say about this movie. It feels like they were trying to go for something different, they absolutely failed in that endeavor, pretty much catastrophically I'd say. However, I will start with the positives. Like I said, the movie does try to go for something a little different, even though it becomes pretty predictable after a certain point, which also happens to be fairly early in the film. Emilia Clarke does a decent job, I think she's very charismatic as an actress and does what she can with this script. The cinematography is fine, it's not an ugly movie to look at. And that's pretty much all the good things that I can say about Last Christmas.Like I said, after a certain point, you can pretty much guess exactly where the film is going with every single plot point and character. This would be a good time to talk about the characters, which are all bland, generic and provide zero originality and there isn't a single thing that is remarkable about them as people, other than nationalities, sexual preferences and race. I actually think this is something Paul Feig, who directed the movie, doesn't understand, Now, I get that he didn't write the script for the film, but this is also something that happened in his all female Ghostbusters remake, so I'm going to comment on this issue. The issue being that simply because you insert a character who is either female, black, gay, lesbian, russian, asian, etc. does not mean you have a special character who is even remotely interesting. I couldn't tell you a single thing about any of the characters in this movie (except perhaps Emilia Clarke and the main guy, who I'll talk about in a bit). A fair amount of time is dedicated to other people other than the main characters and there is nothing to them, they are just generic people in a bland movie.Anyway, I thought the guy who plays Tom, I believe he's called (I called him the main guy before), was completely uncharismatic and acted poorly in the film. The rest of the performances are fine, I guess, even if the characters are extremely superficial. But perhaps the gratest fault of Last Christmas is the comedy. This is by all means supposed to be a comedy, and it attempts to be funny, but the film falls completely flat almost every single time it tries to be comedic. I sort of (but not really) chuckled once during the entire film.I said the movie is predictable, and it is. There's a certain plot ""twist"", which is also entirely predictable, by the way, and it's just dumb. I thought it was one of the dumbest plot twists I'd ever seen in a film, it makes zero sense and it tries to push the message of the movie, which has to do with having a good heart and recovering after (literally) having your heart broken.I'm done talking about this movie. Last Christmas is not subtle, predictable, not funny and tasteless.",Last Christmas

Why did it take me so long to learn how to skate? I guess she inherited that talent because . . . well. You won't hear it from me. Spoilers come later in this critique.Clarke is a great actress and I love that she can sing so well, too.

They look like they could salsa dance across her forehead.But----she's gorgeous and fun to watch.I have a mild crush on the Asian dude. What's his name again? The Crazy Rich Asians guy. Umm.

Also: I think Emma Thompson chews up the scenery in such a splendid way.It's a love story of sorts, I suppose.SPOILER ALERT from here on:I loved the part about Albert's ""lesbian pudding.""

Emma Thompson impersonates a Russian, then a Serbian, then she says, ""Hey guys, have you seen my West Indies immigrant impersonation?"" and everyone is like, wait, what? No, Emma, No! So she sulks on the couch and complains about the Polish.

124,shimenpf,Way to craft a plot twist,7,2 January 2020,"When i read the synopsis of this movie before watching it, I didn't know what it would really be about. I figured it was simply a Christmasy romcom, which I was okay with, but expected no more. I was surprised in a great way.
The movie is very character driven, as most romcoms. In fact, it uses the same structure as it is, for 75% of its length, a movie of that genre.
The plot twist changes it all. But even though it is unexpected and surprising, it is not unjustified. In fact, by the time it is revealed, it has been setup very carefully, by showing us there's something odd about Tom, nobody knows him, and by having Emilia's character tell us about her heart transplant situation in a scene that is disguised as only emotional and as a bonding between characters. The plot twist makes sense, fits well, and is fulfilling.
To be honest, I didn't like Tom for most of the film. For me, he was preachy and too perfect to be any relatable. However, by the moment he tells Kate that she can't depend on him, it all made sense. He was there to teach her that she had to stop clinging to every men and relationship she had, and start to do things by herself, to be herself and free herself. I feel Kate's flaw could've been setup in a more deeply way, by having her affairs really having a negative impact in her life. Other than that, I enjoyed the movie and, save for the expected cheesy romcom moments, it was very good!",Last Christmas
125,sanjin_9632,Emma Thompson is a treasure!,7,9 January 2020,"This film is an obvious attempt at delivering another *Love Actually* around Christmas.. the only problem is: It's not Love Actually.. it doesn't have the parade of famous actors.. the humour and dialogue is not as good (why do they use the word 'dissimilar' so much? - at least 2 or 3 times on different occasions).Since i'm originally from the Balkans, i very much liked the refugee angle..
I like how they chose Yugoslavia as the country of origin for the main character, but i'm a little disappointed she didn't put in as much effort as Mrs. Thompson language-wise. Apart from the lullaby, Thompson pretty much nailed everything .. from the pronunciation to the portrayal of the mother (reminded me of my mom, in lots of ways). I have always (since the early 90s) been impressed by her talent and acting ability. I'd go as far as saying that she's pretty much in the same league as Streep and other actresses who enjoy seniority (Dench etc.).Michelle Yeoh as Santa was a surprise.. i very much like her in the role.. very versatile actress as well.Other than that i cannot really say too many good (or great) things about the film. It's another rom-com with an undeniable Christmas theme.. it's very enjoyable.. no doubt about that.. i would give it a clean 6 out of 10 if it weren't for

After years of being fed 'rom cons' that aren't actually funny like 'love actually' and yes 'crazy rich asians' (Sorry Henry and Michelle. That film was a hot mess.) how can you not fall in love with the delightful Emilia Clarke? You could see how much fun she was having in this movie bursting through the screen. Henry Golding is always yummy to look at but here he had to do some heavy lifting acting chops as well and did well. I do agree with the criticism of the film that the 'twist' almost negates the entire movie,
Which also prevents me from giving it a perfect ten. It's just such a plot hole! If he was...then how could she...WHAT?! It almost even doesn't make sense. It was comforting though to go with a girl friend and be quietly sobbing together at the end. I wish I didn't have to end the way it did, but (almost) everything else was so delightful.Two major complaints:
1) setting of brexit. Please keep your politics out of my movie. The time you wasted reflecting it could have been better spent explaining your plot hole end.
2) *SPOILER ALERT*
The gay sister. I mean, really who cares? One thing that disappointed me was not going into Kate's medical history and why she needed what she needed in the first place.

128,helenbassett,"Last Christmas Film Review - Paul Feig Directs Emma Thompson, Emilia Clarke & Henry Golding With George Michael On Chorus",10,6 December 2019,"Paul Feig directs a chocolate box of Christmas with Last Christmas, and there were tears. Emilia Clarke is Kate, a George Michael loving Saturday Elf, now full-time, in Michelle Yeoh's 'Yuletide' Covent Garden store. She's rocking around the Christmas tree in Chinese silks while Kate is in elvish green velvet, it's definitely Santa's grotto in there. And I loved the Covent Garden setting, the ideal place for a year round Christmas shop, and my old stamping ground, plus I lived in Islington, shout out to Upper Street Market. And as a Christmas buyer I recognised it all. With George Michael and Wham on chorus, this was ready for a party. Never recognised a bus though, the geography was a little all over. Hackney, Brixton, the tunnel? Who lived where? But let's not quibble about geography. It's London as its most glittery and Cecil Court is still a gorgeous little bookshop yard. Unsurprisingly Last Christmas had to be filmed in the middle of the night.Emma Thompson as Kate's Croatian mother Petra, and the film's co-writer, may have written a cutesy Christmas film, but this is Britain in 2017, and with the Brexit vote an Out, foreigners are not welcome on some buses. But there's humour as well as sadness. The family had to leave Yugoslavia after the war. And all Petra's friends were killed. That's funnier than it sounds from Emma Thompson! But it's not a happy family. Dad Ivan was a lawyer then, played by Boris Isakovic, he now drives a taxi, and stays out of the house when his wife is awake. Petra also blames the Polish for all this unrest with foreigners! Eldest daughter Marta, played by Lydia Leonard, is the lawyer sister to our Fleabag Kate. They don't speak. She has a lovely, let's call it Islington, town house. Kate however is a mess, something inside her doesn't feel right, and she has nowhere to sleep except sofa surfing with her friends. Other than her parents house of course. With her friends she has something of a history with frying fish, (hilarious), burning ships and squashing geometric models. Sorry! Drinks 'like a pirate', eats a terrible junk food diet, and takes no exercise, unless you count one night stands with inappropriate guys. If nothing else the film will remind you to look after your heart.And Emilia Clarke twinkles her way through it all with those amazing eyes and eyebrows of hers. Isn't it time she had a break and met a good guy for once? And Henry Golding is the gorgeous Tom who she keeps bumping in to. He's always there at the right place at the right time. Except infuriatingly when he's not. He works nights you see.And while Kate is not falling in love with Tom who is not her type, she's trying to make it as a singer, she was a former Yugoslavian church choir soloist, she must get the voice from her mother! But seriously Emilia has a good voice. And she even auditions for Frozen, on ice. Tom has never heard of Frozen, but takes her skating for the thrill, as she actually cannot skate. She'll just wing it. And unbelievably he keeps his phone at home in a cupboard. It makes life so freeing. Kate has never met anyone like him before. I'm not sure any woman will. Or man, as the film is very aware of the LGBT and BME community and gives them all space, this is London after all. And it is George Michael's music on the playlist.There are sensitive portrayals of the homeless and disabled, of course Tom, who must be an angel he's so damn perfect, helps out at a shelter, or something to do with the church it's attached to, and encourages Kate to help out too. And she enjoys it. The day job could do with some Christmas sparkle though, Michelle Yeoh calls herself Santa as she loves Christmas, she also called herself Kitten when she worked in a pet shop and Muffin when she worked in a bakers! But she has weird ideas of Christmas decor. It's the Chinese suppliers she knows Kate tells Tom! Mind you I was never big on safari animals for Christmas tree ornaments, and look at the menagerie in store now. I'm not sure about a Christmas gibbon though.I dare say there are faults with the film. Especially for critics who are paid to watch every film and a Christmas feel good movie is probably not their choice. But Last Christmas has a cracking cast and a charm that pulls you into Kate's world, and we enjoy seeing it through her, and Tom's eyes. Matchmaking for Santa with the equally crazy about Christmas lovely Danish man played by Peter Mygind, who has a job in something to do with sauerkraut. We know him from all the Danish dramas we watched. A really sweet romance. And Kate is putting together a Benefit for the Church shelter. Where she gets to perform again. Last Christmas of course. Which you'll go home singing because it's Christmas, if you have a heart.Paul Feig's Bridesmaids which everyone raves about, was funny, but a little too earthy for me, but I loved his A Simple Favour and Last Christmas is a cosy slice of Christmas cheer.",Last Christmas

However I hated the twist with Tom's character b/c it was like having the rug yanked out from under you and suddenly you're watching a completely different movie from what you thought it was. While it irritates me the whole he was dead all along thing, once I started thinking about it it actually made sense. Like whenever they were together she was the only one who talked to or acknowledged him and when she talked about him to other people no one had heard of him. I still think they could have made the twist literally anything else and it would be a better movie. The only reason it gets six stars is Emilia Clarke's acting, I found Kate to be endearing and entertaining but I won't be rewatching this which is big for me b/c I always like rewatching movies.",Last Christmas

134,JaynaB,If Bridget Jones had a different heart,8,5 November 2021,"This starts off as absurd as Bridget Jones, as trashy as closing time in any hookup joint, and it creeps toward a real, serious, deeply loving and human film that hits holiday notes far deeper and stronger than the usual Christmas fare.Emma Thompson did a great job on the co-writing but surely she could have resisted the urge to appear in it as well. There must have been other actors capable of that role, perhaps actually from the former Yugoslavia. Not that there was anything wrong with her performance - it was as usual spot-on - but in this age of actual representation it seemed like a mis-cue every time she appeared. A needless distraction from an otherwise very entertaining and heartfelt film.Overall I loved this movie.",Last Christmas

137,paaskynen,Just OK,6,21 November 2019,"In order to stand out, critics are always sorely tempted to exaggerate... The worst film ever, eh? Where does that leave Blubberella? No, Last Christmas is not as bad as it is made out to be. It is not very well done though. Its greatest failing is that the protagonist is pretty unlikable throughout the story, or so unlikable initially that redemption comes too late to warm to her plight. Emma Thompson could not make her character work; I kept seeing Emma Thompson. The twist was too predictable and most (though not all) of the jokes fell flat. On the upside, the side plot of ""Santa"" and ""Boy"" is fun and the sound track contains some entertaining classics.

It was a sour, unpleasant script with an unredeemably awful lead character; a twist halfway that wanted to make you feel sorry for her; and then another twist that made no sense other than being a desperate attempt to attach meaning to a charmless story. I feel sorry for the regal Michelle Yeoh and the dashing and handsome Henry Golding for being wasted here, and having never seen an episode of ""Game of Thrones"", I have no idea who Emilia Clarke is, other than she wrote a great essay on her aneurysm for the NYer.

This would be the story, does it stand up to scrutiny, does it have artistic merit, if it says comedy on the poster, does it make you smile. Next would be the acting. Do they come across as believable. Then you have the production, including direction and editing. Does it show a level of talent you would expect from a film with this much hype.
Unfortunately Last Christmas fails on all counts. The story is bland, with a bit of politics thrown in, as if Ben Elton wasn't doing this thirty years ago. The acting is more wooden than toy soldiers, and it all just feels as if someone worked out that this sort of film would make around 80 million, so lets spend a million buying the theme tune, and then 20 million on the film, possibly 5 million on advertising.

161,michaeldoud,"First Hit: It started off on the silly side, and by the end, I was very touched by this heartfelt story.",7,10 November 2019,"First Hit: It started off on the silly side, and by the end, I was very touched by this heartfelt story.I'd seen the previews for this story and thought, oh, this could be a silly sort of way to spend an hour and a half. However, I'm glad I didn't judge the movie by the preview. It has a beautiful and deeply touching message.The story begins with watching a young Kate (Madison Ingoldsby as young Kate) being the lead singer in a Yugoslavian church choir. Her mother, Petra (Emma Thompson), Ivan her father (Boris Isakovic), and her sister Marta (young Marta played by Lucy Miller) are in the audience watching. There is a moment in this scene that plays out later with the sister Marta looking at another person in the choir.Roll into the future, and the twenty-something years old Kate (Emilia Clarke) is living in London as is her whole family. Kate is working at a Christmas store that's open year-round, owned by ""Santa"" (Michelle Yeoh), who loves Christmas and the magic it brings. Kate is her employee and dresses like an elf. We get that Kate isn't a perfect employee but that Santa likes her for some reason.Kate rushes out of the store to make singing and acting auditions but is usually late, rarely prepared, and seems to have lost her ability to sing as well. We soon get that Kate's in a rut, which is compounded by her almost always homelessness. She's often shown dragging around her roller suitcase. At times, when she needs a place to sleep, she picks up guys in bars, sleeps with them, but something invariably happens, and she's back on the streets.Her friends, like Jenna and Rufus (Ritu Arya and Ansu Kabia respectively), give her a room, but within two days, she's messed this up, and they ask her to leave. She tries to reconcile with her family, but her mom is tough, and her father hides from her mom as much as possible. She and her sister Marta (Lydia Leonard) seem to be at each other's throats, and there appears to be no love lost anywhere. The family dynamics are really screwed up.All during these scenes, we are under the impression that Kate has no common sense, is flighty, and very ungrounded. Some would say unlucky. There is some hint that something happened to Kate about a year ago, but at this stage in the film, we are not privy to that part of the story. Did this event cause this ungrounded flighty nature?One day Tom (Henry Golding) pops into her life one day and impresses upon her to take a walk with him. She declines, but on the second random meeting, they walk, and you can see his caring and compassion for others, including Kate. The chemistry is strong between them, and he just seems like a wonderfully lovely person who's taken an interest in Kate. She wants to see him again and asks for his mobile number, but he says he doesn't use it, and it's kept in a kitchen cupboard at home, so giving Kate his name would be useless.On one of the walks, Tom takes her to a homeless shelter. Thinking he's trying to get her to stay there, she discovers; differently, he volunteers his time at the shelter and says she could help as well. But as Tom is prone to do, Tom disappears for days at a time. No one seems to know where he is.Kate begins to sing outside the shelter, collecting money, hoping that Tom will pop-up again. Alas, he doesn't, but just as she becomes even more despondent Tom shows up again.One evening she tells him what happen to her a year ago and why she doesn't feel like a whole person anymore. It is genuinely a sweet scene. He tells her that she can change her life by being open to others and by making kinder decisions. She's not a victim and can change her life.Tom's influence has a positive effect on Kate. She starts to make amends with ""Santa,"" her mom, dad, and sister. She volunteers more at the homeless shelter and is more thoughtful. An example of this is early in the film we see her getting picked up at a bar from some guy using a standard line. Now, we see her in a bar, she gets the same pickup line from another bloke, and she makes a better decision.A fun secondary story is about ""Santa"" trying to find companionship dates for herself. One day ""Santa"" meets ""boy"" (Peter Mygind), and how they engage with each other is so sweet and funny.I cannot delve into what happens to Kate that made her feel the way she does, nor how Tom is there to help her see the light, but the story is sweet, and the ending was fun and touching.Clarke is a hoot and actually inspirational as the film moved along. She did a great job of making this character work. Golding was beautiful as the man who pops into Kate's life to provide hope and inspiration. Yeoh is hilarious as the Christmas store owner who can see Kate's sweet side. Mygind was excellent as ""boy,"" the man who brought joy to ""Santa's"" life. Arya and Kabia are fantastic as Kate's friends, who keep supporting and allowing her to get better. Thompson was oddly funny and entertaining in her role as Kate's mother. Isakovic was terrific as the browbeaten husband of Petra and Kate's father. Leonard was harsh in her role as Kate's sister, with whom there were a lot of animosities. I didn't think this part of the film was developed enough, and their conversations felt too jarring at times. Thompson and Bryony Kimmings wrote this screenplay that didn't telegraph the ending, and that was a good thing. Paul Feig got the feel of this story right.Overall: After the end credits, I was surprised by how much I ended up liking this film.",Last Christmas
162,olivewahh,"Obvious twist, but enjoyable film",8,14 February 2020,"After seeing the trailer, I was almost put off from seeing this because the whole story was ruined before it was released, but I'm so glad I gave it a watch.Kate (Emilia Clarke) works at all year round Christmas store and somehow manages to survive couch surfing day by day.
While spotting a confused looking man out the front of the store, Kate goes out to see what he's looking at and meets Tom (Henry Golding). After the two share an instant connection, Kate opens up and grows closer to others while enjoying the little things in life.Even though I knew what the twist was, I still really enjoyed this film which even brought me to a few tears. It's a cute romantic Christmas story that also tackles issues such as racism.

The critics are actually right about this one. I previously thought they were being harsh but now I see the validity of their remarks. The ending was nonsensical and the editing/continuity was terrible. I don't think I'll ever watch another Paul Feig film again.

Anyone that likes Feig's other worm will know there will be a little bit of political messages but I didn't find them over the top. I enjoyed the subplots in this film.

165,hnhnyc,The Horror. The Worst. Here's Why.,1,22 December 2020,"This is like a George Michael fever dream that never gels in any way that makes sense as it turns into a disturbing nightmare. The protagonist is unlikeable, (and is later revealed to be clearly mentally ill, as there is not enough in the plot twist to justify a solid metaphor or any thoughtful, meaningful symbolism), and spends the movie giggling her way through what we later realize are delusions. Set to different music and pacing, this could have been a horror movie quite similar to the one they ultimately ripped off at the end. The ""twist"" is so full of gaping plot holes I'm surprised we didn't all twist an ankle navigating them in the ""revelatory flashback"" sequence. The political subplot thrown in here is sloppy and insulting, and I'm left feeling deeply uncomfortable about what felt more like a mediocre SNL spoof trailer that lasted two hours. Hearing ""Last Christmas"" sung at the end with the reveal now in plain (grotesque) sight made me literally grab my own face in horror and shout ""Nooo!"" as I realized that the title lyric was literally the basis for...this.

166,DJKwa,A Lump of Coal in Pretty Packaging,5,7 November 2019,"Fans of schmaltzy rom-coms rejoice! Last Christmas is here and it's a sickly-sweet holiday treat that will either leave you wanting seconds or asking for the bill after the first bite. Call me The Grinch, but I wanted a refund.The film stars Emilia Clarke as a hapless mid-20-year-old stuck in a dead-end job as a Christmas store elf. Things take a turn for the better when a mysterious stranger (played by Henry Golding) enters her life, helping her piece her life back together just in time for Christmas.It's never a good sign when the film's trailer feels like the whole movie, but you would be right on the money with Last Christmas. As soon the first trailer hit the web, the film's twist had already been dissected in the YouTube comments and those holding their breath for something more will leave sorely underwhelmed.Sure, you don't go into a film like this expecting to be surprised but neither do you want it feeling like it's three steps behind you just because you've seen the trailer. Yet, as soon the film delivers its climactic plot twist with the earnestness of a kid tying their shoelaces for the first time, the film quickly trips over its own feet.It's hard to lay blame on the marketing department as there's not much to work with in terms of the film's story. Taking its title from the 1984 Wham! pop song Last Christmas, the film treats George Michael's music with the same depth as Yesterday treated the Beatles; as window dressing. When it comes to the actual film, it's nothing more than your typical Hallmark movie of the week. Watching Clarke bumble around is endearing enough for the first half or so but it wears thin quickly and the predictable story line does little to keep things interesting.So, the question remains: how far can a film go based on charm alone? Well, your mileage will undoubtably vary based on your tolerance of saccharine love stories as Last Christmas is as sweet as they get. Its lack of cynicism and Clarke's infectiously bubbly lead performance will likely be its saving grace for many, but Last Christmas' story feels like a lump of coal wrapped up in pretty packaging.",Last Christmas
167,TimMeade,A Cliché-Ridden Christmas Turkey - Avoid Like the Plague,2,10 November 2019,"Hot on the heels of a raft of films using classic pop as their driver - Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocketman, Yesterday, Blinded by the Light - comes Last Christmas.Directed by Paul Feig and co-written by Oscar-winner Emma Thompson, who also appears, Last Christmas uses the music of Wham! and George Michael in its bid to usurp Richard Curtis's copyright on all things London rom-com.The story centres on Kate/Katarina (Emilia Clarke), the daughter of Croatian refugees (Thompson and Boris Isakovic), who works as a sales elf in a Covent Garden Christmas store. Recovering from life-saving surgery, her chaotic lifestyle leaves her dependent on the goodwill of friends for places to live. Unfortunately, her annoying habits soon dry up any good will and she is constantly moving on. Into her life comes the mysteriously benevolent Tom Webster (Henry Golding) who flits in and out seemingly arbitrarily.Perhaps Emilia Clarke plays the irritating Kate too well as it's difficult to have much sympathy with her homeless plight; she rather brings it on herself you feel. Henry Golding as Tom is expected to do little but smile and look winsome, as he did in Crazy Rich Asians, and he does this with consummate ease.The script from Emma Thompson, her husband Greg Wise, and Byrony Kimmings is low on humour, preferring to take aim at what it perceives as a xenophobic strand of British society. Yet Emma Thompson herself goes for cheap laughs with her fractured English and misunderstanding of English idioms. It culminates in a penile joke, the like of which hasn't been aired since Mr Humphries asked if he could have Spotted Dick in the Grace Bros staff canteen circa 1975.The film's use of George Michael's pleasant pop also misfires through lack of imagination. In Rocketman, Elton John's music was used extremely well as a compliment to the evolving storyline. Here, the songs simply strike up on random play adding nothing to the plot or purpose of the film.Oh, and 'the twist' and its denouement was a carbon copy of a Hollywood classic from twenty years ago. This, and the obligatory shots of a gleamingly lit pre-Christmas London seen many times before, sum up the whole film as derivative and unoriginal. It was also unforgivably tiresome.Is there anything good to say about Last Christmas? Well, after watching this you'll probably think of Love Actually as being a seminal work of art.As the whole film was a self-contained cliché, it seems quite appropriate to describe it as a Christmas turkey to be avoided like the plague.",Last Christmas

It's not the kind of movie I'd normally attend, but even the moment I'd kind of see coming managed to make my eyes wet.There is laughs and tears throughout, and a positive message. The critics need to be ignored on this one. We enjoyed it.",Last Christmas
174,istara,"Sweet film, not too saccharine",8,27 June 2021,"An enjoyable Christmas romance movie with a twist that prevents it being overly-saccharine. The leads are strong and very watchable, and the character development of Kate/Katarina from someone truly awful to a good person was quite credible.The only real error was making the family Eastern European. Even as a non-European, Emma Thompson's accent etc felt cringeworthy, and judging by the reviews here, they got everything wrong. There was no need to make the lead family migrants or Eastern European, the film was diverse enough. Or why not simply make the sister's partner a refugee or someone at the homeless shelter?If you're looking for a Christmas film and can't stomach a maudlin American Hallmark nausea-fest, give this one a try. Yes, it does overdo the London-luvvie-PC thing, but there's just enough grit to make it palatable.",Last Christmas
175,yeolit,Budget film of a thirsty woman finding her quench thirster,9,9 December 2019,"This film actually started off pretty bad, I can't remember how much I rolled my eyes. It was such bad screenwriting it felt that some scenes were awkwardly inserted so that the movie reaches minimum length or something.As the film goes on however, I noticed that the storyline progresses into somewhat an abstract form, with some focus, but not enough. It's like a camera going off focus then on focus, sometimes just confusing.The part going into the climax and then the ending was the part that really saved this show. The content isn't exactly original, there are quite a few other films or dramas which have similar content, but the presentation is really good.Right from the beginning until the end, the lead actress Emilia Kate really reminded me of Emma Stone, and her role in La La Land. There were some definite similarities between the 2 films as well. The other movie that this film reminds me of is The Birdman, given its abstract concepts and on-focus, off-focus style.In short, Emilia Kate really shined in this show, her performance being much stronger than any other cast, and is probably why this film is a masterpiece, like how Emma Stone shaped La La Land.Screenwriting however, leaves a lot to be desired for the earlier 70% of the film.",Last Christmas
176,imjaredross,A Simple Romcom Drowned in the Christmas Season,7,4 December 2019,"I'm always a sucker for a good romcom from time to time and I was actually genuinely interested in this based off of the cast, director and writer. The movie comes from Paul Feig mostly known for his comedies and yes ""that"" Ghostbusters, but in the past he has proven himself a very solid director. And Emma Thompson penning the script had me intrigued and overall I enjoyed my time with this film.For one I think this is a solid movie to watch around the Christmas time, drenched in the Christmas landscape it at times can feel like a bigger budgeted hallmark movie, but the cast is way better. Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding are terrific in this film and showcase some genuine chemistry on screen.The film also has a lot of heart and is at times very magical. The script that Thompson has written goes into some interesting directions with some twists that at the end of the day may seem heavy handed but I found them sweet and pulled off well in the context of the film.Perhaps the films biggest flaw is it's familiarity and Hallmark channel vibe, but it's actors and the spirit of the film managed to get to me and made this ultimately a win. It's a fun film, not the best this genre has to offer, but for a film taking place around Christmas it's something that's at least worth one watch.",Last Christmas

Amelia Clarke is wonderful in all bit one scene, the story is somewhat endearing, feels current and has it's heart in the right place. It's diversity feels just right, it's not in your face, it just feels natural.However, this film has the worst plot twist I have seen in quite some time. It just didn't work at all. We've seen at least 50 films at the cinema over the last year, thanks to the Odeon Limitless pass, and this was by far the worst 'desperate' plot twist.Other than that, it was just fine.

Absolutely every aspect of this movie is below par. The script so thin that the cavalier overacting can't possibly compensate. Dull direction and overdecorating doesn't help either.

The story is so thin it gets to be see-through and unfulfilling. The premise is just not strong enough to last a whole film unless it sits on some tough and moving building blocks. Sadly it's short and choppy seas instead.However , the worst sins are the obvious check-box from other Chrissy classics. There's the side-kick friends, wheelchair character, go-to work boss, rebel sibling, sing-alongside and a rather horrible ""good cheer"" foreigners scene.

184,WillsFilms,Last Christmas Isn't Really Something Special,7,16 December 2019,"Last Christmas is an enjoyable watch if you know what kind of movie you're watching. It's terribly written and very corny, but it's filled to the brim with Christmas spirit. Films like Last Christmas and Love Actually fall into a category of films that I like to call 'Christmas Cringe.' Crappy Christmas romcoms that are just bathing in their corniness, to the point that you just can't judge it critically and have to except and enjoy these movies as a staple of the Christmas season. However, Last Christmas does have other things going for it. Emilia Clarke is amazing in the lead role and delivers a lot of warmth and likeability to the movie, despite the initial selfishness of her character, and her journey throughout the film is interesting and it's rewarding to watch her become a better person. Emma Thompson is amazing and delivers most of the the movie's funny moments, with her great comedic timing. However, Henry Golding is the weak link. He does fine with what he's given to work with, but his character is so generic and bland that literally any other actor would deliver the same performance. Also, the plot twist is one of the most predictable in film history. I called it just before I even arrived at the cinema. Because it does deliver on making you feel the Christmas spirit, I'd recommend Last Christmas. It's corny, but it knows it is and is having fun being so. However, if you've already spent too much money on your Christmas presents, then rewatch a Christmas classic like Home Alone or one of the A Christmas Carols.",Last Christmas

But this is ultimately neither a romance, nor a comedy!As a movie, in general, it is not that bad. It's a little bit fun in the first half, the chemistry between the two likeable protagonists attracts you and you hope they'll get together. There are some good scenes, that feel natural, but it does have a few other ones that ultimately feel odd (e.g. flirt scenes between the characters nicknamed ""Santa"" and ""Boy""). Additionally, I find it good, that it deals with subjects of always having positive thinking & attitude and being independent.YET, the movie has an unexpected turn that is SUCH a let-down, destroying our image of a happy & fun Christmas movie, which made it impossible for us to enjoy the movie overall. We don't recommend the movie to you! We'll actually try to forget it!Lastly, Emma Thompson's acting is brilliant, as always, yet it's disappointing to learn that she co-wrote the story and screenplay. I was also told a big part relates ""Seven Pounds"" closely, making it unoriginal.P.S. I found it great that the movie (initially) indirectly promoted the less usage of smartphones.

It's a perfectly decent little Christmas movie, anchored by a wonderfully charismatic performance from Emilia Clarke. The biggest flaw is the plot twist, which you will see coming a mile away. It's just painfully obvious. Also it's really not a romantic comedy per say, it's a comedy-drama, but fairly light on sex or romance, so adjust your expectations accordingly.

For those smart enough to see the 20 minute gay-friendly short ""Cognitio"" and liked it, you will like this 102 minute film even more.
Emma Thompson had the approval of George Michael to proceed with a film regarding the lyrics to the self-titled song, and after nearly 10 years it has come to fruition. Initially paced at a common formula romance story emblazes once a major twist develops. ""Game of Thrones"" Emilia Clark shines as a lazy worker with a history of medical problems which unfold later in the story. The attractive Henry Golding appears as yet another love interest in protagonist Kate's life, but develops into something more than ever expected. Life is not always as clear or simple as it seems. Writer & mom of said protagonist sparkles as an immigrant with truth and fear personality traits which many in today's narcissistic & too conservative society need to be more aware & empathetic towards, including but not limited to the homeless , whose characters play a pivotal role in the story line. Alternative lifestyles are accepted as they should be in this story as well. The Christmas Spirit is alive and well, not to mention, (in a Dickens-kind-of-way, Ghosts of Christmas past.) Michelle Yeoh's courting relationship exemplifies a character of truth and honor, something most lacking in today's environment, & I couldn't help wanting to see more of it, yet, Ms. Thompson stays true to the plot, and gives proper focus to Kate & Tom's affinity about each other, as a well written story line should be. A feel good story which emanates from every fiber of Kate's being, alternative lifestyles, paying respects to older generations and current generations who are down on their luck, which will illuminate the need for one to pay it forward this Holiday season and in the future, as today's society about honor , dignity, and truth are sorely lacking. Hopefully, this will become a Holiday classic in the style which Dickens originally intended, brilliantly portrayed by Emma Thompson & her husbands written story of a very prominent ""Last Christmas"" for one, if not for all. God Bless Us Everyone (who shows empathy towards one another, not just certain someone's narcisstic Scrooge self-centeredness.) Lessons to be learned for sure.",Last Christmas

We loved all the characters in it specially the two female cops they need a show all on their own and loved all the homeless people.

Yes, she worked in a toy shop, but that was the only hint of Christmas. The George Michael soundtrack was wearing. Yes he recorded some great tunes but I can only assume his family were sponsoring the movie for the amount of songs they used in this. Emma Thompson's terrible acting as someone from Yugoslavia was cringe. And why bring the depressing repercussions of brexit into what was being sold as a comedy?

229,badscene,"Paul Feig makes his first Trainwreck!! (Yes, this is much worse than Ghostbusters)",3,17 February 2020,"Wow, this movie was painful. It's horrible. Forced quirkiness. Zero chemistry. Stilted dialogue delivered with all the precision of a deafened adderall binge.I like Emilia Clarke on Game of Thrones, but she was a poor casting choice here, and her comedic chops are just not there.The plot? There is none. Girl meets guy. Guy kind of stalks girl. They walk around and point at things. She has no goals or obstacles. There are no stakes. There is no structure. And Don't even get me started on the twist.I'm a big fan of Paul Feig, Freaks and Geeks being my favorite series, and have never seen a Paul Feig directed comedy that hasn't had me laughing out loud ie: Bridesmaids, Spy, The Heat. But after the spectacular Comedy / Thriller, A Simple Favor, I really thought he had become a master of comedy enough to fuse it with historically incompatible genres with surgical precision. But this was disposable hallmark quality garbage. The script is the biggest issue here, but the performances are so wonky, I can't help but wonder if he was even on set when he ""directed"" this film. What the hell Paul!?Anyways, BOTTOM LINE - If you enjoy hallmark style ""christmas movie of the week"" type films with absurd plots and bad casting, then this is that with a much bigger budget and lots of
George Michael music. Everyone else, this is no Bridesmaids or even Notting Hill for that matter.",Last Christmas

I'm a huge Christmas nut, I absolutely adore Emelia and love George Michael but WHAT A PILE OF RUBBISH!! Where to start with this hot mess?!1 - It's a Christmas movie, why on earth did they confuse it by adding a political agenda with no clue which angle it was supposed to be headed in?! What was the point in adding the Yogosalavian/Croation element other than to prove Emma Thompson can do an accent? It was factually incorrect, confused the story, confused the viewer and generally just added bitterness to what could have been an ok movie2 - Due to previous point, they then had no time to develop the actual storyline and rushed the ending so quick I can't even remember what happened and I watched it yesterday3 - The plot 'twist' was obvious from the start, how anyone didn't guess it is beyond me. So we all expected it but they could have done it better...made it more sentimental, given them more screen time4 - Kate's God awful sister was a terrible person full of bitterness and hatred. To give her character a complete turnaround needed more time and development, not a bottle of champagne on a doorstep and suddenly she's singing Christmas carols5 - Was it supposed to be a comedy? Or a political movie (the whole Brexit 'you lot go back to your country' bus scene and the bi-racial homosexual angle and how this is accepted in other cultures). These are serious political matters, perhaps not best tackled in a 30 second scene during a Christmas movie. I don't remember laughing once now that I think about it so perhaps it wasn't a romantic comedy after all?!6 - Did anyone else notice that even Emelia's gigantic and usually captivating smile couldn't hide how much she just was not committed to this?!I could go on but you get the point. Go see it because it's Christmas but don't expect a lot. And you'll be ok to take a nap during the movie too.",Last Christmas

The story turned out to be entertaining and uplifting. All of the actors did justice to their roles and it turns out that I enjoyed this movie immensely. While it reminded me of some other films, it is definitely not derivative. Also, if you enjoy George Michael's singing,then you are in for an additional treat.

I was rolling my eyes every 5 minutes.It is also supposed to be funny. I didn't laugh once. Thompson and Wise try to have their insufferable lead Emilia Clarke utter what they believe to be the wittiest lines you've ever heard.

I will say this though: while I like a lot of the messaging in this film and how Christmas looks inside of it, it's a bit weird in that it's almost like a film specifically built around the musical works of George Michael instead of being a film that features the works of George Michael.Also (***spoilers***) it's predictably sad and the film is very much not the rom-com that it is advertised as being (*** end spoilers***)

The second thing i loved about this film was its overall theme about having and adventurous spirit and not only being open to all life has to offer ..but actually taking the time to enjoy it. This film is about love,love of self ,love of others,love of life . Awesome life affirming movie! Another thing the was awesome about this movie were the filming locations, it captures some parts of london that are not seen on film often if ever,great location work. Lastly the cinema photography

251,gustavobacelar-64245,Warm History,7,13 April 2020,"A Christmas movie that doesn't have many Christmas features. The Christmas tree, Santa Claus and Christmas ornaments are all in the background in the story. Its normal to expect the same story in theaters at this time of year and that is what makes this film - not stand out - but different from the rest.
The characters in the film are quite eccentric and none of them escapes this adjective. Michelle Yeoh and Emma Thompson have the strangest characters - in a good way - from the plot of the film. A Christmas store attendant with peculiar tastes and who has a romantic and secondary plot with the character of Peter Mygind, who can possibly get some laughs from the audience. And a mother from a broken family who is very protective of one of her daughters and is very afraid of being deported to her country of origin. Lydia Leonard's character has a small plot that I could call a dramatic and essential background, but it just stays there.
Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding for being the protagonists, are the ones that stand out the most in the film. As stated before, none of the characters shy away from the adjective eccentric and strange. Emilia Clarke puts her essence of romantic comedy characters here and manages to be funny without being forced, possibly captivating the audience with the situations that surround her created by the script and is mentally messy. This all makes us want to follow its history and learn more about it. In the case of Henry Golding, they make up a very correct character and who possibly does not make many mistakes in his life. That's what makes the character weird.
What may have surprised me in the entire film was its ending. It can be a little predictable if we think a little more outside the box and take the idea a little more than half of the film. In this case, it didn't happen to me. I was surprised and a little sad by the situation.
The film is full of imperfections, such as the little importance they give to the dramatic background of some characters, but it is full of fun scenes that make your heart warm when you see them.",Last Christmas

There is also anti Brexit sentiment, indirectly accusing the millions who voted for Brexit as racist. Also, all the main characters speak with plum posh English accents (as they do in all British films of this ilk), but will live in working class areas with tower blocks, markets and pubs in the background. In reality, people who live in these areas are definitely not wealthy champagne socialists like Emma Thompson. However the local, white, male character with a London accent is portrayed as a racist, verbally abusing people on a bus.

258,markjayaweera,Charming Movie with great soundtrack,7,2 December 2019,"**Contains Spoilers**Disregard what the critics in the mainstream media say. It just goes to show you have to watch a movie yourself and make your own mind up about it rather than go on what so called critics say. I personally found this movie a very enjoyable charming little movie.The movie has a surprise at the end which I am not going to fully reveal. Suffice to say that this movie is similar to the 1990 American movie Ghost. That of a love story between a woman and man who died and became a ghost.I thought the two lead actors Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding did a fine job in the movie two talented actors. This is a charming love story of tragedy and hope of some Londoners set in London.Emilia Clark as Kate is a young Londoner who works at a Christmas souvenir shop in the run up to Christmas, with ambitions to become an artist and follow in the footsteps of her hero. The 1980s British pop icon George Micheal. Henry Golding Tom Webster a fellow Londoner works at the local homeless charity. Tom Webster interest in her and eventually knowing that Kate despite her outward happy bubbly outlook is hiding the deep unhappiness inside the unhappiness of her home life and the fact that she did do as well as her sister in life who became a lawyer as her parents wished, Because kate had different ambitions to become an artist and was already auditioning for acting and singing roles and had applied for one of the art schools in London. Not going to say what happened in the movie except Tom Webster comes along when she was at her lowest ebb showing the elusive nature of finding happiness. That just being a human being in this world is hard and Tom fully understands fully what Kate is going through. Tom also tells Kate the reason why he works in the Homeless Charity is because that is where happiness and fulfilment can be found. When as Kate says at the end. ""Happiness can only be found when you help others."" What a wonderful message from a movie to send out. Kate joins the Homeless Charity and helps out and she found her unhappiness slowly dissipated gaining fulfilment from helping others less fortunate than herself a gift Tom showed her. Kate and Tom fall in love.
Later she goes and visits Tom at his apartment or flat as they say in London. To discover an estate agent their. To her shock she discovers from the estate agent that Tom Webster was the previous owner and was killed while cycling in London.Tom is revealed to be the one who's heart was donated when he was killed while cycling in central London. Then ending had similar tones to the ending of 1990 American movie Ghost. This is a charming move and I for one enjoyed and took away an important message away from the movie. Finally, it's great that talented George Micheal is remembered nearly 3 years after his passing. I believe George Micheal will get the recognition finally that he didn't really get when he was alive for being truly great artist. Like Emilia Clarke says in the movie George Micheal an extremely talented artist, who was under appreciated in his time. The movie ends with a carving of Tom Webster on the wooden bench after Tom visits Kate for the last time.",Last Christmas

261,Doddi,Surprisingly good yet ... not so surprising - GM music marvellous!,9,7 December 2019,"I have been a George Michael fan since 1983. His music is very important to me and even though I never saw him live on stage, I felt incredible sadness when he passed almost 3 years ago. When I heard that this film - Last Christmas - was being made, I got excited. The music of my hero being used and it was quite well documented. It even felt a little bit too much for me, because I couldn't believe that my hero's music meant so much to so many people and on such a broad scope.The term ""christmas movie"" is also important to me. It should be a feel good movie with a happy ending. I have many faves in this category (It's a wonderfule life... Love Actually, Scrooged, Christmas Vacation, The Holiday ... etc.) but Last Christmas enters this group right away. I saw the film with my wife in Glasgow and apparently I was a little bit excited because the moment we hear the first song I whisper: oooh... this song is in it ... and whenever a song by GM or Wham! was heard, I got so excited. Especially ""Waiting for that day"" ... it was truly great for me. Of course I think the song ""Last Christmas"" is the best Christmas song, but a whole movie based on it ... I couldn't believe it, but Emma Thompson's script was perfect. Yes, there are stereotypes of course but the banter and the one-liners and ... well, the basic plot was done so beautifully.The ending was of course both sad but yet so satisfying. I didn't see it coming. And the song ""Last Christmas"" - at least a few lines - suddenly have more powerful meaning ... ""I gave you my heart, but the very next day..."". Tom and Katarina (Kate) are fun characters... opposites ... but getting a new heart and being a heart donor is something so beautifully done and described here. I love Tom's character but I also love the development of Kate's. It's ..yes... a classic cliché : the selfish person matures and at the end is very caring and giving. But I love surprises and at the end (and on some occasions in the film) I was ... well, there was something in my eyes... ;-)Acting: superb - main characters great and supporting characters as well (especially those at the homeless shelter).
Script: sometimes clichéd but very beautiful and I loved the plot/ending.
Directing: must have been fun directing this but overall the job is beautifully done.
Music: no doubt that GM's music and songs play a vital part (as GM does in the story as well) but to a fan like me, I found his songs more important to me and it was strange thinking about it afterwards how the usage of the songs in the movie affected me. I really really connected to the movie better because of this.Emilia and Henry had a wonderful chemistry, she was very believable as the annoying and selfish Kate, and even more so as Katarina :-) It's a gem - this movie - not a flawless one, but one for repeated viewings in the future.""There ain't no point in moving on till you got somewhere to go...""Thank you Paul and Emma and all the cast, but special thanks to my hero and his music: GM - I truly love you and your music!Must see film!",Last Christmas

Two really likeable leads this starts off bouncy and fun but there's an awful leaden stretch in the middle where Emma Thompson seems to want to fit in every worthy cause possible. Just as I'd lost interest though a truly bonkers twist happened.

275,carkol2005,A vast whole of nothingness,4,10 January 2020,"I'm gonna be straight with this one because no one put too much thought on this movie anyway: this thing is emptily forgettable, disgustingly political (and contradictorily so) because nowadays any movie director that doesn't have the wit or the guts to make a fine peace of work have to shove politics to fill the blanks, annoying inconsistent characters (like Emilia Clarke's, is she promiscuous? does she want to commit? it depends on the scene I guess), unearned manipulative pathos in the worst Spielberg style imaginable, an endless number of plot holes, absolutely not funny at all (and boy it tries), weird scenes that don't make sense, a boring and pathetic romance which it's just another of those made-up Hollywood fantasies we've seen thousands of times, a final twist that will make you want to throw up and, what is maybe the worst of all, a movie trying to be ""deep"" and ""emotional"" when it's just nothing, a bland pile of nothing.
Positives? Not very much. I got to admit, the addition of Emilia Clarke to this movie really helps it, without her the movie would be even worse. She acts well, she has charisma, and she has the moderate charm this movie needs. The direction is not something to gawk at but it has a few surprises.All in all, there's 0 reasons to watch this.

Here we have a movie based on a single George Michael song (ok, it's Wham! but everyone knows they were a solo act). The usually reliable Emilia Clarke has been morphed into a younger version of director Thompson. And you know, it just doesn't work. The comedic content is childish and misses the mark by quite a distance. Clarke looks disinterested except when she's ice skating. Her co-stars are poor caricatures other than Michelle Yeoh who helps hold together what little semblance of movie that exists here.

The little surprise towards the end of the film so took me by surprise, even though I had been warned to expect the unexpected.As the days go by, however, I'm repeatedly drawn to this cosmic connection between Kate & Tom.

They play George Micheal songs for literally no reason. All the time. It is really an excessive amount of George Micheal songs. And very few christmas songs.
Aside from the annoying soundtrack, the movie itself is pretty boring. A train wreck of a girl keeps doing stupid selfish stuff and pissing everyone she knows off. That is until she meets a mysterious handsome gentleman and he helps her change her life. But wait, there's more! There's a surprise twist at the end. It would've been better if they had done a better job of connecting all the dots. But all the scenes are pretty random. There are a few funny moments though.

The film in general seems to jam as many different nationalities in as possible throughout - I'm going to go out on a limb and say this might be the first ever Malaysian/Danish pairing on screen.All that aside, the 2 leads manage to add a bit of sparkle (Golding is charming throughout and Clarke becomes endearing as she starts to 'heal' herself), which coupled with a Christmas setting pushes you to care a little more than it deserves.As a tribute to Michael, aside from covering a few social issues close to his heart, his music is pretty much in every scene, but can feel very forced at times. Praying for Time, although completely out of context was used to very good effect, whilst Faith and Everything She Wants injected a much needed bit of life into proceedings.Clarke has a very sweet voice and it's a shame she doesn't sing more, I left contemplating if this would benefit from being more of a sung through musical, Michael's lyrics are honest and poignant, and for a film that uses his name heavily in promotion his songs are deserving of more prominence, and although Clarke's character professes to love George Michael it's never really followed through with.",Last Christmas

The ""story"" if almost not existent, and yet, there is still meaning, leaving me stirred even after I got home from the cinema. Performance of the actors is very strong, accross the board; from that angle we are in for a treat. And yes, there is George Michael's music all along, though that wasn't the selling point for me (sorry...), and you definitely won't look at ""Last Christmas"" the same way ever again after seeing this movie.

Does it have the quality of Game of Thrones character development and storylines? No. Does it have the same appeal as Crazy Rich Asians? Probably not. But, does it do a great job putting a musician's catalog of songs into a fictional story? ABSOLUTELY!If you're a George Michael fan, and watch the movie from his song's perspective and get past the romantic comedy category that this film falls under, you'll appreciate what it does to his music. Is there cheese? Sure, but that's part of the charm to get to the twist.Not knowing the twist is the best way to watch this movie to experience what it is doing in dedication to George Michael.I would have rated this movie a 10, but they missed out on some of George's songs that they could have included, but for whatever reason, they didn't.If you got this far in my review and you haven't seen it, and you're a George Michael fan, and you're into the Christmas spirit...

The final twist becomes obvious about 20 minutes in, which leaves us twiddling our thumbs for over an hour without a decent joke or a properly realised character to keep us company.

But that's it, that's basically the entire plot of the whole film. A girl who lives in London, has a dysfunctional family and has some personal emotional problems she needs to work through. It's basically a Hallmark channel film. I mean, the acting is good, the cinematography is OK, but it isn't a Christmas film.

There is very little link between the music and the story. Its similarly woked like the beatles film but that was a far better film with the music front and centre playing a starring role.The funniest part was when suddenly a young white male jumps up and started shouting at a white european couple minding their own business on the bus because they were talking a foreign language. Yes that sort of thing happens every day on London buses ............. only in the minds of hollywood stars as they fly first class between roles. Its fake and just silly.So sadly a missed opportunity. Its a bit muddled bit unbalanced in the story.

And yes that is Amelia Clarke actually singing. If anything it's a bit Bridget Jones grows the f up!
This will be a Christmas TV favorite in years to come and I think will be more enjoyed in the future when people no longer expect it to be Love Actually or Bridget Jones.",Last Christmas

I became a fan with her work on Game of Thrones, and watching her many talk show appearances, where I found her personality delightful.Last Christmas is just a fun movie. A romantic comedy with a twist at the end. All involved did a great job, and Emilia. as expected was adorable. Sometimes it's fun to watch a movie just to be entertained. For me, this filled that bill. The only danger was the possibility of a cuteness overload.If you just want to relax and really enjoy a movie, I highly recommend Last Christmas.",Last Christmas
337,chillibec78,"Worst Christmas film ever, more about migrants/politics than anything else",2,21 December 2019,"I was expecting a lovely Rom-com Christmas film with the theme of George Michael songs, instead it seemed more like political propaganda with some Christmas and romance thrown in.Would have given it a 1/10 but gave it an extra mark because Emilia Clarke's performance was very good. I love Emma Thompson but saw in the credits she was very involved with this film and it's screenplay, so very disappointed in her.If I wanted to hear about the migrant issue I'd watch the news but as I live in the UK, I'm already well aware and didn't want it thrust down my throat at the cinema with the premise of a Christmas rom-com.Unfortunately it wasn't that funny either, there was only one moment where ~50% of the audience laughed. The romance part wasn't much better either.Left the cinema feeling disappointed, cheated and a little bit angry that a potentially nice Christmas film had turned into a vehicle for something else altogether. Just glad I didn't see it any closer to Christmas.",Last Christmas

It was so nice to find a movie that tells a heartfelt story that makes you care about people and makes you count your own blessings.",Last Christmas
341,dastenhero,Jumbled yet overall light and surprisingly deep,6,27 December 2020,"There's a lot to love in ""Last Christmas"" and there's also a lot to question. Some parts of the film are downright weird while others may lead audiences to laugh, cry, or even contemplate their own lives.Many scenes came off as attempting to possess ""quirky humor"" only to fall flat. Others serve as nothing more than fluff to pad the film's runtime. Michelle Yeoh's scenes were particularly heinous - although she does a fantastic job in ""Crazy Rich Asians,"" she is definitely miscast in this film. There is also an abundance of seemingly unnecessary auto-tune applied to the in-film singing performances, though that may be simply there to compensate for Emilia Clarke's voice. That being said, it doesn't seem too manufactured, which leads me to believe that leaving her voice alone would have been the better option. Tom actual actions are also slightly creepy throughout the first part of the film - something the protagonist herself acknowledges yet never seems to actually address through her actions.That being said, for what the film lacks in actual substance, it makes up for in heart. The film is ultimately an optimistic one for the most part, teaching audiences to better themselves through lessons I won't spoil. The plot twist is also exceptionally unique and is something I would not have expected had the movie not been spoiled for me. There's also a certain admiration I have to have for the film due to its depiction of a lead woman who isn't perfect - in fact, she's lazy, selfish, and suffering from a myriad of mental health problems that quite literally drive her to drinking. As a result, there are some really touching moments and some much-appreciated emotional scenes that really make this movie outshine its rougher scenes. And yes, I did shed a few tears, though that happens a lot when I watch movies.All in all, this makes for a good Christmas movie for older teens and adults. It has some crude anatomical jokes and some sexual implications and references, but beyond that is a fairly clean and feel-good film for those who can handle its bumps.TL;DR - It's not perfect, but at least it's optimistic and has a unique twist!",Last Christmas

This was a funny, heart warming and feel good film that will put a bright smile on your face. The film focuses on Kate, who is a bit of a diamond in the rough. When she meets a handsome stranger, he turned her life around and begins slowly getting rebuild her life. Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding were fantastic as the main leads, but Emma Thompson is hilarious as Kate's overprotective mother.

Beautifully acted (heartwarming AND funny!). Lovely pace to it with little threads for all of the characters to follow and Kate (Emilia) went on a beautiful journey, from a confused young lady who had lost her place in the world, to one that was at peace with her life and all that she had previously not appreciated.I loved it.

353,ross-london,Gut punch too far,5,4 January 2021,"This movie is just too sad.It feels like this film got confused with what it was trying to be. City of Angels? Bridget Jones? Anti-Brexit? The confusion results in it not achieving any one of these. Too funny for City of Angels. Too sad and political for Bridget Jones. Who wants to watch a Christmas film about Brexit, racsim and xenophobia?It is billed as a Rom Com, but by the end it rips too hard at your emotions. There is no Rom, by the end.Sure it's OK to shed a tear when watching a Christmas film, but this takes it too far. It is too sad, too depressing. They try and ""recover"" it, but it's not a feel good.On top of that, the bizarre Eastern European accent that Thompson puts on is frankly outdated and, if I were Czech, I would find rude. Particularly as it's totally unnecessary.The anti immigrant plot line also seems too heavy for a Christmas rom Com.Also, although I am a guy, in 2019 surely we can be beyond the loveable but useless ditzy blonde who needs a guy to put her back together again?

358,robert_waked,Better than expected,8,27 July 2020,"This movie is not what you expect it to be. I feel like the trailer and leadup to the movie make it out to be another typical cheesy and predictable romantic comedy revolved around the holidays, but this movie is (for the most part) not that. This movie is so much more. It tells the story of Kate, a girl who used to be very ill and had a heart transplant. After her procedure, she never really felt like herself again. She went on a downward spiral, started drinking, eating bad, not exercising and having one night stands. This created a rift between her and parents (who are separated), and her sister, who is a lesbian but hides that from her parents because she fears being judged. It also ruins some of Kate's friendships as well. But in comes Tom, a sweet and selfless guy who Kate turns to during her difficult time. You can see them falling in love immediately, but it's so much more than that, they seem to connect in a somewhat spiritual level. Even though he's helping Kate in whatever way he can, you can see that Tom is hiding something, but you're not sure what. One day Kate goes to Tom's apartment looking for him, where she sees a realtor selling the place. She starts talking to the realtor about Tom, and the realtor becomes confused and tells her that the man that lived in that apartment died about a year ago. That's when the plot twist becomes clear. The reason why she can feel Tom and he seems so real to her is because the heart that she received for her transplant, was in fact his. He was hit by a bus and was dead immediately. Tom and Kate have one last moment together. He tells her that his heart was always going to be hers, in one way or another. Changed by the influence Tom had on her life, Kate starts to make positive changes in her life and rekindles the relationships that she had ruined in the past year.All in all, the movie adds a fictional twist to help explain the story of a young woman struggling to find emotional and mental stability. Oh and Emilia Clarke was brilliant in portraying Kate, her performance is fantastic and you definitely feel and root for Kate in this movie.
Despite the fictional aspect the movie, which comes as a complete surprise, I still certainly enjoyed it, a lot more than I would have if it was another typical Christmas rom-com.",Last Christmas

In a way, I could sense what's going to happen in the end, but not completely, and I can still say it was a bit of a surprise for me.Another thing that bugs me: at the very beginning, Kate is shown in Yugoslavia in 1999, which at the time did not exist under that name, and there is also mention of war, which makes very little sense. You could connect that to Kosovo in 1999 and NATO bombings, but there's mention of Croatian origin, so that makes no sense at all. I also believe someone who properly speaks Croatian (or the other lanugage it is intended to be, I am still not sure) should've been casted to play Kate's mother, this just doesn't really sit right.

The George Michael songs are wonderful but they chose really bizarre songs at odd moments in the film, ones that didn't suit the scene at all.
The plot is not good. Yes it's predictable but that's not my problem with it. The film makes a big deal about certain points and then entirely dismisses them until things are wrapped up neatly with a Christmas bow at the end.

398,barnandkaren,"A Romantic Drama at Christmas, rather than 'A Christmas Movie'",8,15 November 2019,"Last Christmas (2019) 12A/PG-13Once Last Christmas makes up its mind what kind of movie it wants to be, it's a bit of a treat. For the first 15 minutes it definitely thinks it's a Romantic-Comedy with the emphasis on the Comedy. Unfortunately, the jokes fall fairly flat and, at this point, I thought it was going to be completely useless. However, a third of the way in, it changes its mind and decides the genre it is actually going for is Smileable-Romantic-Drama-With-A-Christmas-Backdrop-And-A-Serious-George-Michael-Fetish. It's a niche genre, I grant you, but Last Christmas nails it.The music is great, and I don't just mean the George Michael hits (if anything, some of them feel a bit shoehorned in at times, as if they just wanted to put them on the soundtrack album). Lots of the incidental cues riff on George Michael melodies and do it very successfully and the opening scene with a choir singing Heal The Pain is fab. The film has received a bit of a kicking from the British press, but you can put that mostly down to the film's political leanings (it's got a bit of an immigration subplot) which haven't gone down well with Brexiteer papers (conversely, the Mirror gave it 5 Stars).It's got plenty of heart and Emilia Clarke is great (and proper, proper fit). Be warned: if you tend to blub at films, I can guarantee you will blub at this.Christmas Cheese Rating: 7/10 - Despite it being chock full of Christmas scenes and references, it focuses on the story and characters more than 'the magic of Christmas'. It's very much a romance with a Christmas backdrop, rather than a 'Christmas Movie'.
Snow Rating: 6/10 - It tries to be a bit snowy, but it is set exclusively in London and it isn't the world's snowiest city.
Actually Any Good Rating: 8/10 - If we're comparing it to typical Hallmark/Netflix crapola, it is vastly superior, but then, you would hope it would be.",Last Christmas

Without giving any spoilers, I felt the story dipped a little towards the end but the finale was quite nice. An enjoyable film. Well worth a watch and one I would watch again, despite its flaws.",Last Christmas

For me that difference was positive; I could balance the caricaturing, the sentimentality, the social commentary and the Christmas dressing. Don't think this could be carried off at another time of year and for some, they won't stomach the dollops of allegory.
I liked the acting and it had it's heart in the right place for me.",Last Christmas

Lovely and Charming, with strong funny performances from 3 actresses - and the lead actor - the Xmas lighting and visuals were sumptuous. Take your mates, take your Mum, take your daughter/gal pals and just enjoy.

Whilst it does adhere to a few seasonal tropes there are some genuinely funny moments, and the score is definitely a must for any fans of George Michael (seriously, that dude had some cracking tunes).Good performances from the cast, some cameos from some British staples, and the theme must have been close to Emilia Clarke's heart (pun intended) given her medical past.Worth a watch if you like Love Actually, and British comedies. Solid movie.",Last Christmas

Let's just say that near the end of the movie everything changes completely. However, it remains a beauty of a movie and to me the three big reasons to see ""Last Christmas"" are: 1. The George Michael songs. 2. The fabulous London Christmas scenery. 3. The excellent cast of great actors who are all fabulous even if they're just reading the phone book. There's a lot of love and loveliness in this movie so I think I will probably watch it many times in years to come.",Last Christmas

After seeing it tonight, I'm slightly disappointed.I felt trough the whole movie like nothing meaningful was happening, I didn't even see an actual plot. In the end I was like what did I just watch?!Also, as a person who lives in country of former Yugoslavia (Croatia) and a person who's native language is croatian, I can say that their pronuantiation of some words and curses in croatian was poor and I think actors should've practiced better (espetially Ema Thompson, who's character is born and raised and lived many years in Yugoslavia). If we didn't have subtitles, I wouldn't understand those parts but it made me laugh. But I also think that this comedy wouldn't be so funny if I wasn't from Balkan because those parts mostly made me laugh.Considering everything, if you like romantic comedies without much romance and don't mind many naïve things in a movie and also want to laugh, I would recommend watching this movie",Last Christmas
416,fullquiver-34782,So so,5,9 March 2020,A good story and actually a good message in this movie; and the acting is above average; but the way Hollywood insists on putting in a plug for things that I consider immoral just turns me off; so I did not recommend this movie to anyone else. Politically correct; if you are into that.,Last Christmas
417,ameliaortega,Touching!,10,18 November 2019,There were times when the pacing was too slow but overall there was a great combination of moments that made me and my friends laugh and cry.

419,hydrofal78-19007,"A dear sweet story, unforgettable",10,18 September 2020,"Really wonderful watching Emilia in such a role, she is doing a lovely character, very pleased with her presentation. She is wonderfully enhancing all the scenes. Emma also lovely and brilliantly moving in her role. Do not know much about the British societies but this movie covers a few topics that I understand could preoccupy the people. Eventually, those are topics that regard all of the societies and this is beautiful in this movie. Lots of nice scenes, the photography is very interesting. Night and colourful lights and cold weather in the city where a young woman works and finds herself not comfortable. She is trying to reach what her childhood memories indicating but life shows another path for her. The story unfolds slowly and extremely beautifully through every scene. A meaning comes up continuously and the spectator is caught up. There is not a chance to feel bored. It comes a sweetness for life with this film. A precious feeling of contacting with people that life brought around. It is not about gifts and shinny holiday. Soul and heart release a fantastic human energy in the process. The actors the production the screenplay the costumes the whole company of people creating this film have done a gorgeous job. Not a wasted line, words come naturally and dialogs bind with the places and characters to give not entertainment but feelings. The intensity of the feelings generated is so cleansing that the mind cannot avoid asking for a re-watch after a few days. Families couples singles friends can find a piece of gold for themselves in this story. Love it when such movies define cinematography. Enjoy !",Last Christmas

We were obviously meant to get emotional for Kate but she was so unlikable I really couldn't care less; and I usually cry VERY easily!

430,jbdriesenaar,Not worth watching,3,14 November 2020,"I wanted to like this movie, but the only thing worth watching was Emilia Clarke. I found the acting overal so bland it distracted from the story. That goes for the left wing agenda as well. Seemed the whole support cast was made up of diverse wokies. There was little humour but a lot of virtue signalling. George Michael's music was nice to hear but seemed out of place in the scenes it was used in. They even managed to use the line ""last christmas I gave you my heart"" in a literal sense, which is frankly insulting to the audience's intelligence.",Last Christmas

The acting of the entire cast is on point.I would like to mention Emila Clark's performance specifically - as someone who only knows her as Khaleesee (and the Solo a Star Wars story role she did...) - she totally disappeared into the role for me. I forgot that she WAS Khaleesee and I got sucked in completely into the movie.

Just a wonderful story about a girl who heart-broken, and now being healed.But why many people hate it? Because it reflect the world we are living right now. We, the people, always finding another reason to blame someone who is completely irrelevant to the root of the problems. We feel uncomfortable to talk about what we have done. We hate Hitler because what he have done to the Jewish people. But look at us today, do some of us ever have the feeling that we are doing the same thing just like Hitler and German had done in the past?
To be honest, this movie is really great because it dare to talk about we feel completely uncomfortable about, and dare to push people's comfort zone.

This wouldn't have been my pick, but once I saw the cast and the Christmas vibe I thought 'why not?'Another draw was that Paul Feig directed it. Who doesn't love Bridesmaids?!It follows a down and out type character played by Emilia Clarke, who plays it pretty much to perfection. I'm not that familiar with her, but she really bears her soul here.The film balances comedy and drama skillfully, I won't go into too much detail, but the audience here in Australia was laughing out loud throughout and my wife and I had tears by the end.This is what I go to the movies for.The good:
script is funny and touching where it needs to becinematographymusic by George Michael - really flows well with the visualsthe pacingNot so good:

Worth watching just for them alone. The movie was slightly spoilt by the  undertones that Emma Thompson with her lunatic left wing views obviously felt the need to put in. It's an insult to the 17.4 million majority who democratically voted and won the #Brexit vote.

498,Marko_lel,Didn't get the facts straight but still ok,7,17 January 2020,"OK so it's time to review this. all first go how are the first second and 3rd act. so the first time it was intriguing just met Kate or Katarina either way the same thing. So we basically meet her she's messages working as an elf and selling Christmas themed presents and toys and stuff. So the first act it is good it set up one part of the story and from there we move on to the second and 3rd act. 1 second deck was more or less the same as every other romance film: yeah everything is great and stuff and then we have the basically dark night of the soul which is the emotional downfall essentially. and after that we will talk about that later and we get the 3rd act which is a good end to the story I would say. OK so let's talk pros -- the mean essential story is very well thought out I would say. the first 30 minutes or so were funny and the next our it was just normal romance film. So one of the things that influenced my rating was the twist at the end of the second act and the beginning of the 3rd act -- And that was the guy that she supposedly was ""seeing"" both literally and figuratively was actually a hallucination because she had transplant surgery and she got the heart from Tom guy she was supposedly seeing let say. And that's the thing the pros boosted my rating. I mean if I watched it more carefully I'm probably picked up so far along the way and probably soon that's how it's gonna happen but if you watch it at midnight then you're just watching it, but that's besides the point. So as someone who is from Croatia my first 30 seconds we're just like God Jesus Christ who wrote this s***, as I saw 1999 Yugoslavia -- at this point I was just like you ""get your facts straight"". Now just one more cons and then we gonna go to characters. press I would say it's not that much of a as it actually is and that is they put a lot of feminist s*** and a lot of PC bulls*** into the movie, We got lucky and that didn't affect the core story just some random aspects of it nothing too major. OK so now let's talk some characters -- 1st we have Emilia Clarke's character -- she played the girl from the start of the film Kate, she starts the film distressed and everything and her character for the first part of the movies was silly and funny and then the second part is got full dark and not so funny nor happy. I mean at the end the movie ends kind of tragically but at the same way happy. Tom's character and from the beginning of the film he seem kind of off and at the end we find out why, but all in all his character was more supporting ten main. So we find out they are a family from Croatia. And the casting choice for more or less everyone except for her mother was great more or less. Her mother really annoyed me -- She couldn't even speak proper English like everyone else in their family despite the thing today lived there for 20 years more or less. And on the other hand she had a Russian accent, she didn't speak any normal Croatian just some weird words and mixture of other similar countries that she didn't even get right so I think if they could have found someone like Kate's father that can speak with normal accent and normal Croatian. I don't see why it was so hard to find someone for her mother that can do the same. It is probably for some agenda or something or she could be an executive producer or something, I don't know. OK and now some final thoughts -- so first of all kudos to Emilia Clark for learning Croatian words. And I just don't get how this movie's a PG13 and not R rated with all this sweating at the dining table somewhere in the second act, it's had more s**** and d**** said then in any other PG13 movie, so that's that. And also I just can't figure out why they got so many facts wrong specially the one at the beginning of the film literally the first 30 seconds. So when you look on overall film, just looking at the main plot and the main characters, that was great, but the other plot points that are really s*** and I'm glad that none of the political stuff was involved in the main story. Overall I think I'm being too generous by giving it 7/10 but if we're just looking for the main stuff(Characters and story) and put all the back story about her family a side I say it's alright not the best, but alright.",Last Christmas

508,larryl-82383,I hardly Give A's away but this was a surprise and an A,10,2 December 2019,"I saw last Christmas the movie, andI was very surprised I don't like too many Love Story comedies but I gave this an A - it was a surprise and worth seeing. Some parts really made you laugh but the overall impression someone down on their luck depressed and trying to start over it's uplifting warm-hearted and I got to tell you a shocking surprise at the end. Last Christmas is a difficult film to review because it turns on a plot twist I can't describe without ruining it for you.Compared to standard genre fare, Last Christmas stacks up well. It's blessed with some good actors: Henry Fielding (T0m) gives sincerity, yet a mystery. Emilia Clarke (Kate) projects spontaneity, and enthusiasm yet an immaturity that , until She realizes her downfall, until she meets Tom.Along with generally good acting, this movie is packed full of positive messages initiated by a caring GIFT! It's got individual themes on the need to accept yourself and forgive others. Parents will particularly love Tom's advice about intentional living - the belief that we become what we do each and every day, thus our every deed shapes our characters. The film also demonstrates the benefits of forgetting yourself through helping others. As Kate throws herself into helping the homeless, after learning from Tom and his GIFT to her she renews her zest for living, and focuses on others and not self.
It was a BIG Surprise, Worth an A, If you don't like it you don't have to invite me over for Christmas. LOL",Last Christmas

So thank god for the twist at the end!

Santa and Kate, Kate and her mum, even the two police officers! If there was more of that and less of Henry Golding's blandness it might have worked better.The problem with having a twist like that at the end is that even though it saves the film, you spend most of it going ""really??""And those flashbacks of their romantic moments at the end after the big revelation really weren't necessary either. It seems that the film makers were trying to satisfy the hard core romcom fans - which they are never going to do anyway since it being a story about a woman who takes control of her own life and happiness is deemed ""too sad"" by said fans.The potential was there but it didn't quite hit the mark.

It's so nice just to be able to go to the cinema & laugh again. We NEED more joy in our lives. The soundtrack is just phenomenal too, I mean, too much George Michael is never enough!
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Being a George MEGAFAN, no doubt I'll be watching this every year until the end of time. Do you you know what, the thought of that makes me super happy.
Just go to the cinema, check your worries at the gate & just enjoy yourself for a bit. It won't disappoint, I promise!",Last Christmas

It was surprisingly good and is sure to be a Christmas film rolled out year after year. The casting of all characters was great, it was current, romantic without being sappy and was very funny at times.You think you know where it's heading but don't expect the Hollywood ending. It's better than that! It's very touching and perfectly executed by the cast.Give it a go and don't listen to the cynics if you're a Christmas film lover!",Last Christmas

I wouldn't recommend going to this movie and waste your money.",Last Christmas
534,simone_elmgreen,It could have been better,6,19 November 2019,"Let me start by saying, that Emilia Clarke is perfect in this role. Though intolerable at first, she's never not charming and I was rooting for her character the whole way through. I was entertained for the duration of the movie, but a few changes would have taken this movie from good to amazing.
I like that there was a lot of different characters in the movie. The people at the homeless shelter, the policewomen, Santa and the cabbage-man (being a dane myself, it was a fun surprise seeing a fairly unknown danish actor). But there where too many unnecessary people in there (especially the couple on the bus) and sometimes things went from quirky to too weird (like Santa and the cabbage-mans interaction). And, as others have said, far too many political messages without true substance, but just kind of squished in there.
The family and the christmas concert was my favorite parts, and in the end I enjoyed the movie!",Last Christmas

538,anjapgr,"It is fun, touching and a good choice",7,26 December 2019,"It is not a typical christmas movie. It does not have the happy ending you expect in the middle and it has a shocking plot twist that I am sure no one predicted before it happened. Even though the story itself could be quite sad and dramatic, the movie stays bright, positive, funny and leaves you satisfied when you leave the movie theatre. It is not the best movie I have ever seen. It is not even the best christmas movie ever. But I do not regret buying a ticket, seeing it and spend a pleasent one hour and a half. It was good.
BUT... please, please, please Hollywood I am beging you! If you decide to make a movie about another country, please learn it 's history! I could forgive a small detail but Yugoslavia in 1999? Please! Movie had a lot of historical similar mistakes and was actually full of stereotipes and pretty offensive to people, once lived in Yugoslavia. It was all just good fun for me, I am not that person who spot every single mistake in a movie and makes a scene out of it, but I would not blame people who would get offended. But it makes me wonder what history do they teach in schools around the world if noone could see anything wrong with that story. And let 's be honest, this is a movie, starring Emilia Clark, one of the biggest stars at the moment. And it is christmas movie. People will go to the cinemas and see it. People will pay for it. Is it really that hard just google Yugoslavia and read an article about it in Wikipedia?",Last Christmas

But a Christmas film is not a blanck check to put togheter some typical festive motives and tie it with a nice knot. There has to be more, not only a story that transports the protagonist from the wrong place (heart speaking, literally) to the one where he/she reconnects with himself/herself. And byt the way, poor Emma Thompson, I know you can not be a top performer in each film, but the director shoudn't waste a precious resource.By the way, it's a nice film to cuddle with someone you love, that's true, so enjoy the film, but more importantly, enjoy the company.",Last Christmas

And when you can't stand the lead character all is lost. The use of George Michael songs in a movie sounds like a great idea. It worked for other movies but the people who chose which songs should be where should never do this again. Some of the songs sounded so random. Such a waste....,Last Christmas

Let's get the negatives out of the way first: the first half of the movie is pretty dull and mediocre, the music doesn't always fit the scene, the comedy is more miss than hit and the movie is full of cliches. These didn't bother me that much but they are noticeable. The positives on the other hand are: Emilia Clarke is fantastic as always and she has an amazing singing voice, the acting is really good, the ""twist"" of the movie was unexpected and very sad and effective, the song ""last Christmas"" is beautiful and the ending is heartfelt, sorrow and satisfying. I really liked the twist and the final scenes of the movie. The movie is emotional and has great character moments, most of them are with Emilia's and Henry's characters. Yes it made me cry and i really like this movie. In conclusion the first half is not that great but the second is better.

It doesn't feel like a Christmas movie you want to watch all over again every year with a cup of hot cocoa in your cozy pajamas.The metaphor between the song and the fact she got a heart transplant is GREAT, and the fact that you start questioning if Tom is real a little after the middle of the movie is great too.

George Michael music threaded throughout the film which I thought may detract from the film but if anything it added to it, despite the literal meaning of the title song. Would recommend this highly,.",Last Christmas
607,lulupolly,Don't watch the trailer. And neither read the critics.,7,2 December 2019,"I guess this is the kind of movie that exists only because it's supposed to make you feel something. Well, that's probably the objective of most of movies but there are some of them that only have this as their main goal. And that's where ""Last Christmas"" is headed.
Underneath a poor-ish screenplay, we have a deep and relevant message with a great dose of Emilia Clarke.
To begin with, she is refreshingly fabulous as Kate, or either Katarina, as she discovers herself as the story goes by. And pairing up with George Michael's legacy, we have the perfect christmas combo.
Henry Golding is sweet and charming. Emma Thompson, well, is Emma Thompson. This woman can be anything she wants to be.
And also, why isn't anyone talking about Michelle Yeoh? What a charismatic and light role she played! I really do think Santa suits her.And, as an advice, do NOT watch the trailer before watching the movie because it can be a major spoiler. But still, even if you did watch the trailer, go to the theaters anyway.
Everyone need a warm cup of love and christmas lights in the daily basis. And that's what Last Christmas it's all about.
I guess if we all watch movies like this and keep their very best message as a life lesson, this non-caring and low of self-love world would turn out to be a very nice place to live in.",Last Christmas

Ultimately, it's about self-love. I love how the title of this movie which is the song fits perfectly with the story, literally. That moment gave me the ""aw"" but in an inspiring and uplifting way. It was a nod to Tom. Overall, I love how expressive Emilia is in her acting. It would cheer just about anyone up. It is a light-hearted warm comedy great for the holiday mood!",Last Christmas

Not saying it missed but not what we were told,Last Christmas
612,jannapkoch,Don't think too hard and just have a good time.,8,12 November 2019,"It's not a perfect movie. But the ""huge disappointment"" label is extreme. if you come to the movie theatre wanting a good holiday experience, then I think you will like it...I did. George Michael was more popular with the Brits, than in the U.S., but I always liked his voice and many of the songs. The songs do not always mirror the story exactly, but pop music is ""the soundtrack of our lives"", so if you think of the songs as what the characters were hearing in their lives, it works. I liked the characters and thought that the actors were good in their parts. the actress that plays Kate is adorable. I think she is sort of like a Bridget Jones character and anyone who liked those movies, should like this. Am I going to go out and hire Emma Thompson to play a Yugoslavian mother, not really. But I did not have a problem with her acting here. (better than Meryl Streep in Mary Poppins Returns!) My favorite thing that Emma Thompson does is appear on talk shows...she is sooo funny, so if I have my choice then SOMEBODY please write her a funny, OVER THE TOP part! (And while I liked Late Night, that was not very funny.)But the reason that I am writing this review is because my personal Christmas is not looking to be great this year And so I am very thankful to Emma Thompson and company for writing and producing this movie, because I could surely use some cheering up this holiday season!!! I will be going back to see it again. So my comment is when you go to see it, don't be a HUMBUG , just enjoy the season.",Last Christmas

I was ready for an OTT Rom Com, instead I got a beautiful story that made me sob (a little close to home), with a fabulous performance from Emma Thompson who had me in stitches.

Being a new critic movie , i feel it is quite lovely for the near holiday . Paul Feig gave us overview story around Kate and Tom. The film has shown many scenes of humor, stress, romance and more than the unhappiness in life. Through the film I have drawn 3 things. firstly Christmas is something that can make your heart melt and warm others, regardless of status , 2: Love is always needed at the moment, even if you have to meet a bad day, just watch the light bulbs or walk on the street. Finally the words of the author: we will always give away and receive many words .

She has an Asian best friend who has a black partner but her selfish ways push them apart.The protagonist doesn't haven't a great relationship with her lesbian sister or her black partner either. Fortunately two female police officers keep popping up to add some humour.She falls head over heals for a mixed race man but another black man keeps popping up and he seems like a nice guy. In the end it turns out she received the heart of the mixed race man when he was killed a year earlier.Its refreshing to see a Christmas film which focuses on the story and doesn't try and push any political agenda as so many films do these days.,Last Christmas

These days most movies are about horror, evil, action. Mostly senseless. This film is about unconditional love; a woman who loathes herself, but has her heart on the right place; about being there for one another despite differences, with wit and humor. Also about family.

It wasnt overly sappy and filled with sex scenes like the regular theater movies and even with people spoiling the ""plot twist"" it was still well worth the watch! The storyline is very simple but nothing wrong with a little simplicity. Not all movies should be unpredictable. Predictable doesn't mean unsatisfying. I find the more UNpredictable the movie, the less satisfying because who wants to watch a whole bunch of random scenarios happen in one movie? Not this girl.

It's not trying to be Love Actually! So, if you give it a chance, and simply suspend disbelief, you might find yourself enjoying it. It's kinda like Christmas in that respect. As George Michaels would say, ""Ya Gotta Have Faith."" No, it's not going to become an annual Christmas classic, but so what. It's a sweet, decent, amusing and (believe it or not) somewhat endearing little tale of redemption and humanity. It's not complex or deep, and it's not trying to be.

This ranks with the Bishop's Wife - Cary Grantand Its a Wonderful LifeMaybe some professional reviewers should stop taking there jobs so serious. They review everything as if each new movie is a direct challenge to Citizen Kane. And the reviews for Last Christmas are a prime example.

Not only does it perfectly embody the issues of immigrants and Brexit, it also is a very feel-good Christmas movie that makes you think about your life choices and puts you in a better mind state. The outstanding performance of Emilia Clarke makes this film even more soulful. This film as well embraces important subjects of mental health, financial difficulties of being an adult, the complexity of human psychology and the importance of caring for other people. Despite the mixed reviews by the critics, Last Christmas is a huge box office success for an original holiday movie that is also a rom-com. There are many reasons why the cinemas were flooded with people during its' release month and after, with the biggest reasons being a story full of hope and great performances from Emilia Clarke, Henry Golding, Emma Thompson, Michelle Yeoh and Lydia Leonard.",Last Christmas

Sat down and as the characters unfolded I was drawn into the film quite easily.
Being an old George Michael music lover help me to really love the characters and their roles - Emma Thompson's role was wonderful as was Michelle Yeohs good woman attitude.

As soon as the real estate guy said that the old owner of the apartment was dead, instant realization hit me like a train and I just started sobbing.

Brexit is racist.
Brexit is racist... yawn. Do please give it a rest creative industries. You are very boring. I do wish you could go to the movies now and not be inundated with political points that leave you feeling annoyed. Why go out of your way to annoy half a nation, plus most the rest of the nation that wants a bit of escapism from their movies, not more nonsense.There were a few funny lines against a very obvious plot that moves remarkably slowly for what I think is fairly short movie.Emilia Clarke however, is actually very good in this. She plays her character remarkably well, in a way that makes you both like and dislike the character as befits the situation of the film. Her co star is a bit of a wet blanket. Not familiar with him and I certainly won't be looking for any of his other works any time soon.In short, I will never watch this film again and begrudge the fact that on one of our very rare nights out, having hired a babysitter, I ended up watching this point scoring predicable dross that seemed more preachy than entertaining.",Last Christmas

It seems that she thinks mumbling means speaking a foreign language. Well, Emma, you could put at least a bit more effort and learn to say those few sentences properly. Emilia on the other hand did a better job. Her sceen on the bus was great. She really did her homework. I also think that they could save time and money finding an ex Yugoslav living in Britan to play the father. Boris is a way too good actor... Cursing at the dinner table - terrible!

Sure the script and plot aren't out of this world, but the movie had me smiling and shedding a few tears too. Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding were amazing (as always) and the ending really touched my heart.
Deducted one star for historical accuracy, but then again the family's background was not the central focus of the film so the inaccuracy did not take away from the plot. Nonetheless, for such a renowned team of filmmakers it's weird to see such a slip-up happen.
Don't pay attention to the reviews bashing it for the inaccuracies and 'political intentions' of the film, it's a wonderful feel good movie that really touches you.",Last Christmas

Her emotion-grabbing, rubber-faced twisted eye brow takes are on par with Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett. Who knew? The big surprise is how the cast sticks every abrasive and loving note of the solid yet predictable script. The joy is in the execution.

Well let me tell you it's BAD.Despite taking place at Christmas and being set in a Christmas shop it didn't feel Christmasy at all. There was hardly any plot but what plot there was was predictable, the rest of it was just meandering and out of place. And their justification for all the George Michael music is that she's a fan, which is mentioned at the beginning and never again so it wasn't really built into the plot and the songs they chose to use had nothing to do with what was happening at the time so it ended up being weird background music. Not really the tribute it was advertised to be.Just go listen to George Michael's greatest hits, it'll be far far more enjoyable.",Last Christmas

698,FranticGT,Could be great without those political correct scenes,6,8 November 2019,"2019 is the year that film industry crashed so hard that they don't know what to do next. On one hand, we have the masterpiece - Joker which speaks loudly if you make a good film without forced educations people will flood to watch it. One the other hand, we have so many big name franchises bent to the will of the progressive lots and bombed with hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.Enough of my complaints, to this film.
A well directed drama with fantastic casts. I actually enjoy watching Emilia doing drama rather than Game of Thrones, especially the last season. This is where her acting really shines, you can feel her joy and pain and those in between. Emma Thompson puts out a very convincing performance for a migrant mother with control issues, and her foreign language skill is on display. Henry Golding did not out perform himself in this film than the Crazy Rich Asians due his role's supporting nature and film's narrative. I almost hoped for an interaction between him and Michelle Yeoh, which would be interesting. Surprisingly, Michelle did something out of her usual tough woman roles that got me completely.Soundtrack is great, and if you don't already know, Emilia Clarke is quite a capable singer.Points lost for the political correct scenes and the love drama routines. Ain't London a very diversified city? I feel those educational scenes rather forced and unnecessary.All in all, you will not be disappointed unless you generally don't like those stupid political messages in entertainments.",Last Christmas

Yes the script isn't the best, and sometimes the acting can be a little poor, BUT yet again it scores as it touches the heart and gets you really thinking about life.

703,Iznogoud76,"Good movie, but... Can you please do some research before making movies about other nations, especially when it comes to languages and culture?!",7,24 January 2020,"For a start, a movie is not as bad as a movie, but there are many uncertainties and imperfections in it. First of all, it says at the beginning - Yugoslavia 1999 ... OK, but then it is the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) made up only of Serbia and Montenegro that existed until 2003 and the only war that could be escaped then was the bombing of the NATO alliance, though, I can safely say that those who were running away were very, very rare...
Secondly, swearing at the dining table in the family circle is simply not acceptable to any Balkan family (I take into account here that the film refers to the SFRY in spite of the stated year) and especially not to such swearing that was said in the film!
Third, Petra as a middle-aged woman speaks worse in her native language than her daughter (Kate), who went to live in another country as a teenager. Really?!
They should have asked Boris first to explain to them all about the Balkan culture and language...
Overall, the movie is not bad at all, to someone who does not know the culture and language of the country being talked about, and despite the imperfections, it has my warm recommendation.",Last Christmas

720,roberta-koncar,Missed opportunity - from a fellow Croatian,4,13 November 2019,"People don't usually expect much from Christmas movies, they are all more or less the same - plenty of Christmas music, nice atmosphere and warm stories. The trailer promised a whole lot of that, but the movie itself did not live up to my expectations, which were quite low to start with. The concept itself is quite okay, Katarina is working towards a better life after going through a heart surgery, but is generally a mess. Who isn't, by the way? This storyline is perfect for a Christmas movie, she meets a man (or more precisely, imagines a man), he helps her, everything is cool.
BUT the other storyline, relating to her Croatian roots is a bigger mess than she is. The opening scene, a children's choir in a church in Yugoslavia... well, we all know how plausible that is. I'll tell you anyhow - it is not. Not only because the religion was not ""a thing"" back then, but also because it says 1999. Yugoslavia was long gone by then. The language they speak throughout the movie is anything but, it was a messy hybrid between Croatian and Russian and Macedonian and I don't even know what other language. Also, if they all come from Croatia, how come her mother's Croatian is so much worse than her father's? The casting was done terribly in that sense. A Balkan actor for the father, but an English actress for the mother? I'll pass.
Also, her mother blaming Poles for the situation makes no sense at all, and neither does the fact that they curse at each other at the dinner table. We don't do that. The respect for other family members is a huge thing here, and we would certainly not say those things to our parents just out of the blue.
Finally, the choice of George Michael's songs did not fit the story points at all, it all seemed misplaced.
In my opinion, it is just not worth watching. Go watch Home Alone for a 1000th time, you'll have more fun at least.",Last Christmas

This is an instant perennial Christmas classic with many layers leaving you wondering if the two main characters are a metaphor for the conflicting characters that made up the musical maestro whose classic pop songs provide the soundtrack.I would place it just below a Wonderful Life and Love Actually but way above A Miracle on 34th Street and everything else way below.It's a seasonal rom com without the abundance of cheese. You know something is coming but there is nothing that prepares you for the tide of emotions that yanks you from the laughter and floods your cheeks with a river of tears.It is testament to George's talent and diversity that a soundtrack crammed with GM classics sounds like a soundtrack filled with many different artists.And, not a single one shoehorned in!It's difficult to determine whether hearing George singing the MTV Unplugged version of Praying for Time stirs you most or the crescendo of emotions that converge to bring this story to its heart wrenching conclusion but either way - take your tissues.This is not a cheesy pastische of a pop star's classics set to a cobbled together script propped up by current popular actors.This is true Christmas classic - just like Last Christmas was 35 years ago!",Last Christmas

Emma Thompson should really do her research. The ""Croatian"" she spoke was something with rolling ""r""s that resembled Russian but had no connection to any real language. KGB that she fears so much was an SSSR intelligence agency, not Yugoslav. And btw, by 1999, the Yugoslavia she sets the opening scene in, did not exist as a country (for at least 7 years). I'm surprised that Emilia Clarke, who spent years filming Game of thrones in Croatia, did not notice some other absurdities about the way it was portrayed.

It was one of the last showings at our cinema. After a false start with the wrong movie been shown (Last Right), this was rectified by Vue and we sat on our own in the cinema to soak in this wonderful movie. I dont do 10's normally, but when I thought back about what I'd change and how the movie made me feel, I couldn't fault it. We will be buying it on DVD and watching it over many Christmas's.

750,sevargo,Annoyingly PC.,2,14 December 2020,"Wow. Even in the year of Covid this is one of the darkest parts of my 2020.
Not a film to keep you on the edge of your seat, or to laugh along with, or to be amused by. Unless you love the lack of a plot, suspense or a script. Take the Christmas lights out and it's not Christmassy. Zero chemistry, subplots for fillers and fake accents by the dozen.
Is it written by an undergraduate at Oxford University looking to be the party's future spin doctor? We had a tick sheet for every politically correct character about to appear; we ticked them all.... nothing wrong with that, but a plot and good acting was desired more.",Last Christmas

755,AmberPennington,It's not what it appears to be,10,2 December 2019,"Last Christmas, by all accounts from the trailers and advertising, seems to be a romantic comedy. It however, is not. It is a powerful message of trauma, PTSD, hollowness, and grief. It is a movie that needs to be watched at least twice to understand the entirety of the film. It is a movie that will leave people who have never had trauma and loss in their life confused and angry at the ""lost potential"", and leave people who have had trauma in their life grappling with the possible triggers that encompass the entirety of the movie once we realize what is going on. It is a beatiful film that really grapples with what it means to be a survivor of a horrific accident, and what it means to be told ""Your lucky to be alive"".",Last Christmas

Emilia Clarke's acting was super annoying and over the top, just like how it was in Me Before You. The editing felt messy and the humor was horrifyingly awful. Michelle Yeoh's monologue about the names she used in her former workplaces was so cringey that you'd think those lines were written by an eight-year-old. Overall, everything felt forced and cliche in this movie, even Henry Golding's charisma could not save it. If you want a real holiday rom-com, this ain't it.",Last Christmas

An impressive story that will make even the coldest of us think about ourselves. Emilia clarke plats such a wonderfully complex character and by that I mean she plays her outstandingly well also. Emma thompson is so funny as the slightly crazy mother to Emilia's character who herself us a little cooky. Watch out for Emilia's singing too which is yet another highlight.

First of all, they mentioned they are Croats. The movie begins with her singing im Churc in Yugoslavia 1999 and Emma Thompson mentions later they moved becausw of the war. In 1999, Croatia was not part of Yugoslavia any more! Afterwards, when Kate screams KGB to her mother to scares her ??? It was security agency in Soviet Union. Again, nothing to do with war and her trauma from Croatia. IT IS NOT SO HARD TO GOOGLE THIS OR I DON'T KNOW... MAYBE READ A BOOK OR ASK SOMEONE. And last but not least, the ""old croatian song"" they sing at the end - not at all Croatian. Maybe Polish or Russian.

Unless we're watching a documentary, we're not worried about history, geography or language inaccuracies. Grow up people....... who cares if they didn't have carol singing in a 1999 Yugoslav school.... why does everything in life have to be bloo..... politically correct for some of you.Secondly, this was a fairly decent portrayal of mental health issues........ and it dealt sensitively with it...... we all have our demons and if a movie can show someone fighting their demons and trying to win over them it deserves a fair watch as it might help someone in real life.Live and let live people......... there is already so much negative in the world........ having an opinion is one thing but running something down just because it's not politically correct or looks pretentious is just plain silly.",Last Christmas

Why did I pay money to see this travesty of movie? It's as if the Sixth Sense shagged a Hallmark movie and had this wretch of child, Last Christmas. If awkward comedy and disturbing, dead people romance is your thing, then go ahead and make the mistake of seeing Last Christmas. If that's not your thing, stay home and do literally anything else.To be a little more specific about what makes this movie a grievance to humanity, let me explain things concisely: There are a migraine-inducing number of plot holes, the factual inaccuracies will make you weep, and it was as predictable as the sun rising in the east.To emphasize how much I detest this movie, I made a list of activities I would rather partake in than see this movie again:
-Chinese water torture
-Fall into a pit of vipers
-Pet the bear Leo fights in The Revenant
-Move to an island inhabited by cannibals
-Be trapped in Jumanji for 26 years
-Exclusively eat Jack In The Box for the rest of my lifeIn conclusion, I do not like this movie. I want to be a a good citizen by warning humanity about how terrible Last Christmas is. You will thank me, and so will your psychiatrist. If you've already seen it, I'm sorry I was too late.

First off, I love a good holiday romance and even on occasion the cheesy hallmark movies....this, however, was so overly corny with little real character development that I left the film a bit annoyed. If you actually watch the movie, the ending is completely obvious within the first 30 minutes of the film. While I love the main actors and they do as good of a job acting as the script would allow, there are a lot of goofs and weird interactions of some of the side characters (Santa and ""Boy"" mainly) that ruins the film. The overall story had the potential of a great holiday romance, but sadly the execution failed to achieve this.I won't give any spoilers away, but would recommend if you want to watch this movie to wait until it leaves theaters and you can watch it for less, and in the comfort of your own home where you can multi-task as that is all this film is good for....background distraction.",Last Christmas

Were they Serbian? Croatian? What Yugoslavia in 1999? What war?

I feel like I have to tell you that Emilias character earlier had a heart transplant and now we find out that her heart belongs to this boy that she's been seeing, talking to, kissing etc. So... He's a ghost, because she has his heart he's following her to make sure she takes care of his heart or something.

Main character is just totally unlikeable, rude and not particularly bright for no good reason. The plot is insanely predictable and all secondary story lines never lead to anything. Playing around with historical and/or political events is not a good subplot for a silly Christmas movie if you are not careful and don't give it enough attention.
Christmas miracle is not self explanatory in the way this movie is trying to show us, and nice songs are not an excuse for anything.
