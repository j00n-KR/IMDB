0,SnoopyStyle,pinnacle of teen cliché movies before the gross out era,7,11 October 2013,"King of high school Zach Siler (Freddie Prinze Jr.) is unceremoniously dumped by hot queen Taylor Vaughan (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) for an idiot realty TV star (Matthew Lillard). While bragging about his prowess, he's challenged by his douche friend Dean Sampson (Paul Walker) to remake class freak Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) into a prom queen.It's sort of like a modern adaptation of Pygmalion. This and other teen movies are prime to be mocked. RLC is a hot girl, and of course we only realize it after she takes her glasses off. But every genre has it's own clichés and it's own stereotypes. It doesn't negate the genre. This is a prime example of a movie taking all the clichés and making it all work for them.The most important part is definitely RLC. She does the grumpy girl and the sweet girl. And she does both by being the cutest ever. There are also some great young actors of that era including Anna Paquin, Dulé Hill, and Gabrielle Union. The cast is a young energetic group.",She's All That
1,Quinoa1984,Not the worst,5,24 October 2000,"While I would never put this film up with the contender teen flicks (American Pie for instance), if there was a pick between this and Bring it On, I'd go for the first.  The story follows a smart, preppy, and popular teen (Freddie Prinze Jr.) called Zach who gets dumped by his girlfriend, but then takes a bet the to turn a outsider art girl (Rachel Leigh Cook has some great charm and sexuality) into prom queen.  While I wouldn't call this the best idea to turn someone's mindset like that, the film makes it almost work, and slightly (though never completely) makes Zach's lifestyle apealing.  Sweet romantic comedy, though it isn't a quality flick. B-",She's All That
2,studioAT,Mainly known for the title song 'Kiss Me',2,29 July 2017,"As a twist on the 'ugly duckling' story this is a decent enough romantic comedy, but one that can't help but look a little dated.Freddie Prince Jr made a few of this type of romantic comedies in the 90's and is on good form here, supported by Matthew Lillard and Dule Hill of West Wing fame.Once it gets over a slow first 30 mins it picks up considerably, with some nice scenes between Price Jr and Leigh Cook.It's not the best film ever made, but it's enjoyable enough viewing.",She's All That
3,utgard14,"""I feel just like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. You know, except for the whole hooker thing.""",6,9 August 2014,"Silly but fun teen romantic comedy about a high school jock (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) who bets his friend (Paul Walker) that he can turn a geek (Rachael Leigh Cook) into the prom queen. Flimsy updating of Pygmalion is hard to hate. It doesn't take itself seriously in the least. Yeah it's absolutely ridiculous that Rachael Leigh Cook, an exceptionally pretty girl, would be considered unattractive just because she wears glasses and overalls. But you just roll with it because it's cute and fun. The cast is very likable and the script is good for this type of movie. Matthew Lillard steals pretty much every scene he's in. It's fluff but you'll be smiling when it's over. Can't see the harm in that.",She's All That
4,neil-476,"Shaw, eat your heart out",7,8 February 2009,"She's All That (an idiotic title deriving from some rap thing halfway through) is a decent teen romcom. It has absolutely no surprises (as is the case with most romcoms), a couple of winning performances from Rachel Leigh Cook (somewhat sibilant, but well able to project the progression from geeky wallflower to attractive Prom Queen contender) and Freddie Prinze Jr. The supporting players all do well, also.Most interestingly, the key plot element - that jock Zack can transform geeky Laney from nerd to Prom Queen - is lifted wholesale from George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion (aka My Fair Lady without the songs).And it is yet another example of how well a good story transfers between genres.",She's All That
5,anaconda-40658,She's Not All That.,3,4 May 2015,"She's All That (1999): Dir: Robert Iscove / Cast: Rachael Leigh Cook, Freddie Prinze Jr, Matthew Lillard, Jodi Lynn O'Keefe, Paul Walker: Everything that has been done before in countless other films. Title regards potential in person and activity. It stars Rachael Leigh Cook as Lanny, an art student who works at a deli as well as manage her home with her widowed father and wise-cracking younger brother. She is the target of a bet by popular jock Freddie Prinze Jr. who was just dumped by his girlfriend. He is to turn her into prom Queen, which we know he will achieve as well as grow romantically linked. Recycled plot places Cook in glasses and a cap and overalls in a useless attempt to convince viewers that she isn't attractive. Director Robert Iscove does his best with the overall look and appeal of the film. Prinze plays a complete idiot who should be subjected to several ""kick me"" signs on his back. Others featured are Matthew Lillard and the totally typecast Jodi Lynn O'Keefe. Paul Walker shows up to issue the bet but perhaps he should have challenged Prinze Jr on who can be the first to do a good film. Any so-called message of physical beauty is a complete hoax in this film. The only thing that needed a makeover is the dimwitted screenplay but it appears as if all bets are off to that respect. While Cook is certainly attractive, she is all that and far more than this film gives her credit for. Score: 3 / 10",She's All That
6,Wuchakk,"Good in many ways, but too mushy",6,17 August 2013,"""She's All That"" (1999) is a school dramedy/romance flick -- more drama than comedy -- about a pretty, but outcast, mousy girl (Rachael Leigh Cook) who suddenly has a couple of popular guys interested in taking her to the prom (Freddie Prinze Jr. and Paul Walker). Their motivations are questionable and it stirs up the hot vixen of the school (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe). Matthew Lillard, Anna Paquin and Lil Kim are also featured.The cast is great and this is a worthy story about a social outcast coming out of hiding, so to speak. But the potential depth of the plot needed fleshed-out more and the film's just too sentimental for my tastes -- numerous moments where characters share deep feelings, etc. Don't get me wrong, I can get into some share-your-feelings type scenes, but I didn't care enough about the characters here to make it meaningful or engrossing.Still, the message is good and the main cast members are superb. Plus there's no raunch, which is refreshing. Those who enjoy sentimentality will appreciate it more than I did.The film runs 95 minutes and was shot in the greater Los Angeles area (Redondo Beach, Malibu, Torrance and Cerritos).GRADE: C+ or B-",She's All That
7,Smells_Like_Cheese,It's not all that,3,18 November 2006,"I have to say that this was one of the most insulting films I have seen. I remember seeing ""Not Another Teen Movie"" in the theaters when it was released, and not getting a lot of the jokes because I had not seen She's All That, that's pretty much the main movie that is made fun of. So, She's All That has been on TV, but obviously, most movies on TV are so badly edited and you have to deal with commercials, so I finally broke down and rented this silly movie.She's All That is about a girl, Laney, who is supposed to be ""the ugliest dorkiest"" girl at school, even though she's not really ugly, Zach, the good looking popular jock, has just been dumped by his popular girlfriend and has made a bet with his friend that he can make any girl into a prom queen, so they pick Laney. And something totally unpredictable happens, he ends up learning more about himself and hates that he's using Laney since he's falling for her. But can she forgive him once she finds out the truth? If you can't figure this out, you need brain surgery.This film is totally corny and very unbelievably predictable and has horrible acting with a lame plot. The only thing I found somewhat amusing was Matthew Lillard's character, he was the only character that made me laugh. Laney, she wasn't that sympathetic nor was Zach, so what the heck? God help these actors, because they better not post that they did this movie on their resume's.3/10",She's All That
8,Buddy-51,tired teen comedy,2,21 July 1999,"Ever since ""Clueless"" succeeded in brilliantly updating Jane Austen's ""Emma"", filmmakers have fallen all over themselves trying to adapt literary and dramatic classics to reflect the modern milieu of contemporary teen life.  The latest one, ""She's All That"", is a tired, uninspired retread of George Bernard Shaw's ""Pygmalion"", one of the most scintillating and witty works in the English language.  ""She's All That"" takes the basic premise of the original, but completely drains it of the irony, wit and cleverness that are its hallmarks.  In the original, Eliza Doolittle is a lower class cockney flower girl with real visions of improving her station in life.  In this film,  ""Eliza"" is simply a social misfit who has no desire or even need to make it in the stuffy, elitist tier of this high school society.   The audience develops no rooting interest in the outcome because the goal seems so shallow.  In fact, this Eliza is not even aware of the bet her ""Henry Higgins"" has made that he will change and conquer her as retaliation for his own girlfriend's dumping him.  Thus, sans aspiration, her character becomes just a victim of callous manipulation - until the hero's predicatble change of heart, of course.  The script falls far short of Shavian wit to say the least, but filmmakers bold enough to risk such comparisons should best beware.  Perhaps the most curious aspect of this film is that it is the first I can remember in which a high school is completely devoid of adults of any kind - there's not a teacher, coach, principal, guidance counselor or even custodian in sight.  Needless to say, no one ever even enters a classroom, let alone cracks open a book.  This is, after all, upper middle class America in the 1990's and students certainly couldn't be bothered with anything as mundane as studying at school.  They do have time, though, to devour a pubic hair covered pizza.  Now there's an extracurricular activity fit for the times!",She's All That
9,ThomasDrufke,It's All That,7,2 June 2021,"A premise that isn't necessarily original but one that sure puts a smile on your face, She's All That is a more than just average rom-com. The 90's flare and aesthetic hold up just enough while the soundtrack and charm round out the rest of the movie successfully.7.6/10.",She's All That
10,A_Different_Drummer,Moments in Time,7,3 August 2014,"That the IMDb score is way too low speaks I think to the fact that the intended audience for the film was ... disappointed. Perhaps expectations were too high? Perhaps this story had been done once too often. But the odd fact (and the thrust of this review) is that the film is memorable because the stars rise above the material .... before they themselves burn out and lapse into film obscurity.It was an odd confluence of talent. Director Iscove is well respected in TV but this remains one of his only shots at a feature. Prinze, who had pretty much owned the casting niche he was in, was 23 at the time the film was made and arguably long in the tooth for a high schooler. Nonetheless the chemistry between him and Leigh-Cook was powerful and that chemistry held the movie up when the dialog and the mugging by the other actors let it down.It's all timing. Leigh-Cook never really made the transition to films after, but kept very busy with TV. Prinze never really made the transition, period, but he's still a young guy and who knows? The Pygmalion thing has been done to death but oddly Iscove, Prinze and Leigh-Cook kept it alive for one more outing. Entertaining.",She's All That
11,Irishchatter,A cool movie :),9,1 February 2015,"Seeing this now as a 20 year old and it coming out when I was only just around 4 years old, it makes me think how the 1990's were awesome. Although I have to say, this movie unlike today gives us a scoop of the way people are stereotypically just judged people by the way they look and change them. I honestly think Zac shouldn't have really changed Laney but really let Laney change for herself like!I was so happy to see the stars in this film. Usher really made his character bring a good vibe as a school DJ. Paul Walker (RIP) was brilliant at acting as a really mad frat guy, although I didn't think he was gonna take Laney at the end of the day haha! Also seeing Lil Kim really enlightened this film, however she didn't get much lines in this film which was a bit disappointing but it was great to see her in the film. :)",She's All That
12,UniqueParticle,Underrated sweet chick flick,8,24 May 2019,"I wanna start off by saying Rachael Leigh Cook is gorgeously endearing. Crazy how her character was considered the outcast that got bullied and mostly stayed out of things - kinda similar to me. This is a very sweet charming high school romance, cool how things start off with a bet and lead to love. 20 years later still a wonderful film even though it was my first time seeing it.",She's All That

14,insomniac_rod,Clichéd but delivers expectations.,8,14 November 2007,"Rachael Leigh Cook stars in this filled with clichés movie that may be better enjoyed by girls. Don't get me wrong; I did watch it because I didn't have anything else to do and it aired on late cable and I ended up liking it for what it is: a typical teenager American flick with a message.There are many, many clichés like the nerdy girl who suddenly becomes very sexy and desirable and the jock who ends up falling in love with her.There are elements that make this a chick flick but on the other hand, there are some scenes that make it a clever teen comedy.I can recommend it for those who are still on their 20's and want to watch how young American society behaved in the late 90's.Leigh Cook shines in the lead role; she's perky, petit, sexy and fresh.",She's All That
15,videorama-759-859391,"She's all that, plus a hell of a lot more",8,7 May 2014,"Here's one of the better teen comedies, I enjoyed much more than I thought I would. Starring some upcoming stars, some of them who sadly faded into obscurity, much the same way as the ones did from American Pie, my only regret, was I should of seen this film fifteen years early. Of course my reason for watching this, was for the late Paul Walker, who I must admit, didn't do a bad job here, playing a real a..hole, typically un Walker'ish. Although there are a few clichéd moments as in the progression of the story, I still found this really entertaining, the transformation, staircase scene, that was later mocked in Not Another Teen movie, another one. The unoriginal premise has popular jock, Zack, Freddie Prince Junior, dumped by queen of popularity/vaingloried stuck up/bitch, Taylor. Now Freddie is given a wager, by friend, Dean, a sort of meathead, to change a chosen dork Walker's girl of choice), nerd, geek, rah rah rah, into the prom queen. Plain Jane, Rachel Leigh Cook, is the transformed one, where Zack, of course falls in love with her, but a bets a bet. We know how the rest of the story plays out, but the film's smart script, adds a lot of funny touches, like Laney's after school hobby, an artist venting group. Too, is a reality show starring Taylor's new love, jock idiot (Matthew Lillard), a kind of Vincent Cassell looking guy, who in one scene, makes such an a.. of himself, it was even embarrassing, watching from my end. Check out his bedroom. Here's one 99 film you must really see, a light hearted teen comedy, you can watch a few times. It has some revenge too that I liked: consult Duval's new appearance, and Walker's deafened ears. I like Freddie Prince Junior too. He has a charisma, or magnetism about his presence, where I never really found him impressive as an actor, more someone who got lucky. Pollack is fun as Cook's pool installer father, while Animal House's Matheson, popping back on the screen as Zack's father, marked a nice return to the big screen. Don't knock this one.",She's All That
16,lisafordeay,Not a bad rom com starring Freddie Prinze Jr,5,25 March 2014,"I was just thinking about this movie now in my head and so I might as well do a review on it. The film is about a high school jock named Zachary(Prinze Jr) who's girlfriend is in love with another man(played by Matthew Lillard who also teamed up with Prinze Jr 3 year later to do Scooby Doo). Of course his heartbroken when Zachary's girlfriend dumps him for Lillard's character. SO he decides that his mates(one played by the late Paul Walker) can change any nerdy girl into a prom queen for Zach to take to the prom as part of a bet(like that other film that was released the same year 10 things I hate about you starring the late Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles). Zach of course stumbles across a young nerdy girl played by Rachel Cook who is a rather moody individual who likes to paint and be creative. But when Zachary's sister (played by Anna Paquin)gives her a makeover,Zac falls in love with her. But is it for real or is it only for the bet?Overall it was a cute harmless chick flick and its worth checking out if you like Freddie Prinze Jr. Oh and keep an eye out for Sarah Michelle Gellar(Prinze Jr's wife in real life) and global superstar Usher aka Usher Raymond and Lil Kim(another singer) who star in this chick flick too.",She's All That
17,FiendishDramaturgy,"Predictable, And Without Heart.",2,31 May 2007,"This is not something which I will ever watch again. This is shallow, superficial, and without heart. The performances herein are pretty lame, typical teenage dreck, along with the dialog, the screenplay, and the execution of the finished product.I do not know upon what grounds this movie won a single award, but I can say the only thing this is deserving of is a Razzie. This was pretty darned horrid, even when compared to Shallow Hal! and I never thought I'd say that about any teen movie, but this one really just laid there on the screen, and laid an egg while it was at it...a turkey egg.If you want a good movie along this vein, see 10 Things I Hate About You.It is trash, and as such rates a 2.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",She's All That
18,generationofswine,An Honest Review,6,1 April 2017,"What? No, absolutely not, I don't want to see yet another version of Taming of the Shrew made into a teen movie.What's that you say? It has Rachael Leigh Cook in it? OK, I'll drive.And that is pretty much why I not only saw She's All that, but also brought a ticket so I could see it on the big screen and then kind of maybe purchased the VHS and watched it a lot more than it deserved to be watched.I know, I know, it's an obsession, but hey, she's cute AND she can emote a hell of a lot better than Jennifer Connelly and Jennifer Connelly won an Academy Award.So As a result I've seen an unfortunate amount of Cook's movies.And this one was exactly what I thought it was: a '90s teen version of the Taming of the Shrew.So you know, if you walked out of this with your mind blown by the plot...either you never read Shakespeare in high school--which if you are my age could ONLY mean that you were in an LD class...or it means you are a Millennial that has NEVER seen a teen movie before.In either case, you know the plot, the only difference between this movie and every other teen movie based on Taming of the Shrew is that this one stars Rachael Leigh Cook and is by definition slightly better than all the rest...regardless of actual quality.",She's All That
19,dee.reid,"""She's All That,"" and then some...",8,11 July 2012,"I'm actually surprised at all the negativity aimed at this movie. But I really shouldn't be, you know? It's a formulaic, stereotypical movie about high school and teenagers. In short, it's another teen movie (Not Another Teen Movie - get it?). But there is something disarming about ""She's All That."" It's sweet, it's funny, it's cute, it's charming, and it's kind of innocent (in its own unique way, of course).OK, maybe I'm being a little hyperbolic with calling this movie ""innocent,"" but I'm making these judgments because this is a movie that I've always admired since it first came out in 1999 - I was 14 and in middle school that year, so I was definitely within its target audience - and I eagerly rented it on VHS from Blockbuster Video after being released on home video. Regrettably, I never really watched it again after that for some reason; I really wish I could come up with a reasonable explanation, but I honestly have none. (As an aside, a few months ago I purchased the movie on Blu-ray DVD and I finally had the opportunity to watch the movie in its entirety for the first time in 12 years.)I personally feel that, unlike many of the teen comedies released on the tail end of the oh-so-cynical seen-it-all '90s, ""She's All That"" was one of the far better movies from that time. It was incredibly well-acted (by its wholesome, good-looking leads, played by Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Rachael Leigh Cook), well-written (by R. Lee Fleming, Jr), and directed (by Robert Iscove). I felt that the budding romantic chemistry between the two leads was real and believable. Additionally, the characters, especially Cook's character, Plain Jane art student Laney Boggs, seemed real, three-dimensional, and sympathetic.I single out Rachael Leigh Cook because this was really her movie all the way. In other words, she simply wasn't running her character through the motions of Fleming's script, and she made Laney Boggs all her own - a living, breathing human being and not a brown-eyed, brunette-haired bombshell. She doesn't go from zero to 10 in the time it takes for you to zip up your jacket, no (even though in the real world, it would be utterly ridiculous for her to be considered, even in her ""ugly duckling"" stage, anything less than ""very, very pretty""; all she needs to do is lose the glasses, do her hair, and update her wardrobe and she's done - instant prom queen status). Her transformation into a beauty queen is something that is seen as a gradual process and is full of real effort on her part. In other words, She really is All That.At the beginning of the film, all-American jock - star soccer player - and class president and essentially nice good-guy Zack Siler (Prinze, Jr.) is publicly dumped by his shallow, self-absorbed girlfriend Taylor Vaughan (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) for an annoying reality TV star from ""The Real World"" named Brock Hudson (Matthew Lillard, of ""Scream""). Zack bets with his best friend Dean (Paul Walker) that he can turn any girl in the school into a prom queen in six weeks. Dean chooses Laney Boggs. Predictably, Zack starts to fall for Laney - especially after his younger sister Mackenzie (Anna Paquin) gives her an extreme makeover - and soon finds himself questioning his bet with Dean.As I stated earlier, there isn't a whole lot to the plot that hasn't been seen before in earlier, better teen pictures (like, say, for instance, 1987's ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" which this film could be considered in some ways a modern update of). But what saves it are its performances from two real, likable characters who are given a chance on-screen to really learn from each other, and learn ABOUT each other and make some unique discoveries about themselves in the process. It's just a quality that I wish more teen films shared these days.""She's All That"" - It really is All That, and then some more.8/10",She's All That
20,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,"Sweet, charming, hilarious, touching, and heartwarming romantic comedy",9,17 November 2005,"SHE'S ALL THAT, in my opinion, is a sweet, charming, hilarious, touching, and heartwarming romantic comedy. When Laney (Rachael Leigh Cook) got her makeover, I thought she looked good, especially in the clothing she wore after that point in the movie. It would have been nice if she had kept her really long hair, though. As for Taylor (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe), I thought she was an absolute b****! This was because of her attitude and the way she treated Laney. When she poured beer on Laney's dress at one point in the film, I wanted to grab Taylor and slap her on the side of her face. There was only one scene that grossed me out, and that was the pubic hair pizza scene. Oh, that was really gross! I mean, who would want to eat pizza with someone else's pubic hair on it? That is so disgusting! When Zach (Freddie Prinze Jr.) showed up in the film, he looked really hot, especially in the tuxedo he wore to the prom. Before I wrap this up, I must say that everyone involved in SHE'S ALL THAT did an excellent job. Now, in conclusion, to all you Freddie Prinze Jr. or Rachael Leigh Cook fans who have not seen this sweet, charming, hilarious, touching, and heartwarming romantic comedy, I highly recommend it!",She's All That

Freddy Prinze, Jr. took a page from the Ben Affleck book of acting and gave a forgettable performance as a self-absorbed jerk, that happens to be a soccer jock (which is almost as lame as Chris Klein's lacrosse jock in American Pie). Either way, the only other people who decent acting skills was Kevin Pollack and that darn Culkin kid (can't remember if its Rory, Kieren, MacCauley or Bob).

26,rbverhoef,Predictable but nice,6,9 July 1999,"When I saw this film a couple of years ago, I was sixteen, I sort of loved it. Seeing it again, not in my teenage years anymore, I realize that 'She's All That' really is for teenagers. I still like it, yes, but now that I have seen so many more movies there are a lot of predictable, therefore lesser, parts.For starters it is set on a high school but the characters seem to be in their mid-twenties. Of course that is pretty logical since the actors are in their mid-twenties. Well, Rachael Leigh Cook was only twenty, and I have to admit that she is the main reason to see this movie if you are a guy. Freddie Prinze Jr. is her love interest and personally I think he is one of the most annoying actors out there, no exception here.The whole story is very predictable actually. Prinze is the most popular guy on their high school, just dumped by his beautiful girlfriend. Now he makes a bet with a friend: he can turn any girl into a prom queen. The friend selects the girl and of course he chooses Rachael Leigh Cook. Convenient for Prinze, since she already is a beautiful girl. It does not really matter whether she wears glasses and floppy pants. Of course he really falls in love with her, of course the bet comes out, of course the girl is mad, of course the movie end on the prom, and of course it will be a happy ending.Yes, predictable it is, but also sweet, even with an actor like Prinze. Sometimes it is funny and when you are watching a romantic comedy all you really want, I guess, is the main characters get together in a nice way. That sort of happens. A teenager will probably love it, but others will not completely waste their time.",She's All That

28,Movie-ManDan,I Was A Total Sucker For This.,10,5 March 2017,"She's All That has so much going for it that made a guy like me fall in love with it. First, it is so 90's. That was the last great decade where everything was perfect. Teen movies were perfect, romance was perfect, the music was perfect. The timeless pop song ""Kiss Me"" by Sixpense NonetheRicher was used for this movie. And the other reason why I love this is that it's the modern teenage take on my favourite musical ever: My Fair Lady. Most people that didn't like this must not have liked the element of that. Luckily, I fit in where I love the whole 90's aspect as well as the roots of the film. I'm probably the only person that feels this way, but I don't mind. In fact, that makes me feel like I have a special bond with this film.My Fair Lady is about a well-respected upper-class Englishman who bets that he can transform a cockney woman into somebody classy. She's All That features the most popular guy in high school (Freddie Prinze Jr.) betting that he can transform the biggest basket case in school (Rachael Leigh Cook) into the prom queen.So the plot sounds pretty good eh? It is a process kind of plot where it all depends on the outcome of the idea. Fortunately for this, everything even before is handled just right. We get to know our main characters perfectly and feel for them. We get to know why our leading lady is so timid and our hearts go out. As our leading man falls for her, our heart goes out too.There is real chemistry and perfection behind the characters. This was made back when teen movies were made properly, back when party movies were well done, and when modern day adaptations were faithful to the original but still had their own spunk. I recommend this now more than when it came out.5.8 is much too low.3/4",She's All That
29,nancyldraper,Cute couple - stupid movie,4,26 November 2018,"This is an embarrassment - the story is cookie cutter, the teens are moronic and normalize behaviour we don't want in humanity, yet, I kept rooting for the key couple - I'm embarrassed to have fallen for the romance, despite it all.

Rachael is almost breathtakingly attractive.",She's All That
31,mentalcritic,She's not all that...,4,28 June 2006,"I'll level with you now. Anyone who knows me knows that the only reason I rented this DVD was because of a certain name appearing in the credited cast. That, in a nutshell, is the problem with She's All That. Instead of trying to build a credible drama or comedy with three-dimensional characters, it dissolves rapidly into a farcical study in how much happier we would all be if we thought alike, looked alike, and acted alike. Were it not for the ever-wonderful Anna Paquin making use of a role that benefits no end from her easygoing, honest acting style, I would swear that writer R. Lee Fleming Jr. is a pseudonym for the revolting Ronald Bass. Take a character each from glorified soapies like Charmed or Beverly Hills 987whatever, dump them onto celluloid, mix them in a bowl, and throw them at the screen. The resultant image will not look much different to what you see here. And that's a terrible shame, because in spite of appearing in some terrible pieces, Rachael Leigh Cook has proved she is capable of far better.Then again, I should have been able to predict disaster was in the air when I saw that the cast list featured both Freddie Prinze Jr. and Matthew Lillard, known after Wing Commander by casting agents as the gruesome twosome. Even the central premise is lifted wholesale from teenie flicks that did it far better. In a nutshell, Freddie bets his obnoxious friends after being dumped by the sort of woman I would describe as no big loss that he can take the sort of woman he and his fellow airheads consider less than attractive, then make her over to be the conception these morons have of attractive. It is like trying to put the body of a Lamborghini over the engine of a 1920s Model T or the like. You can polish that bodywork until the beholder sees his own reflection in it, but at the end of the day, the thing will still move like a Model T. And with the exception of Anna Paquin, the entire cast that the bodywork is going over here is incredibly ugly. Writers who fail to realise that humanity's virtues come from its members' differences are already a dime a dozen.But to be fair to the film, Ebert has a good point when he says that it is the details that rescue the film from being entirely a write-off. To use Ebert's words, I was grateful that at least someone could take this weary material and do something with it. Minor details peppered over the main story, such as Kevin Pollak's enthusiasm for Jeopardy, give She's All That a laugh quotient in spite of a central premise that would otherwise become offensive. Indeed, it is somewhat indicative of the cast's quality when one struggles to remember what the first-billed stars of the film have to say for themselves, but any memories one has of said film are all tied to the supports. Freddie Prinze Jr. has gone three fifths of nowhere since She's All That, and no wonder given that he comes off here as something of a fourth-rate Keanu Reeves. I used to joke a lot about Keanu's woodenness, but after River's Edge, I am starting to compare his performance there to Freddie's in She's All That and wonder if maybe we are being just a little unfair to Reeves. At least his blank expression became useful towards the end of My Own Private Idaho.Once upon a time, I told a fellow aspiring writer that the best way to build a character is by reinforcing the audience's impression of them with their actions. Going to the exact opposite end of the cinematic scale and using C'era Una Volta Il West as an example, Sergio Leone made Frank an unforgettable character by showing him shooting a child dead after one of his men calls him by name. And that is one major problem in films like She's All That. The characters are all speech. We are told that character X is this or that by character Y, and the writer expects us to take character Y at their word. With no act on which to balance the verbal descriptions of the character, we are left with little more than a bunch of talking heads. Or a ninety-minute episode of Beverly Hills 12345, if you will. The characters in this mess that do feel like more than a cardboard cut-out are exactly those that should not in comparison to the stars. I know I have said that several times now, but one cannot emphasise that part enough.I gave She's All That a four out of ten. Two of those stars are for Kevin Pollak and Anna Paquin. Between them, they firmly act everyone else in the film under the table. If you are a fan of either of those two, and a rabid completist, then She's All That is worth a look. Otherwise, don't bother.",She's All That
32,mattymatt4ever,All that and a bag of chips,7,26 July 2001,"I'm sure anyone watching ""She's All That"" will be able to list all the major plot points in the first twenty minutes, but that's not really our main focus.  Our main focus is how the film breezes through these plot points with a brisk sense of style and energy.  There's a good deal of flashy visuals, successful attempts at humor and an amazing amount of help from the supporting cast.  One of them being the great Kevin Pollak, who plays Rachael Leigh Cook's father.  Another being the hyperkinetic, animated Matthew Lillard who almost steals the whole show!  He has a great dance sequence in the movie that will always be worthy of a laugh. 
""She's All That"" is shallow and predictable, but what else is new among this genre of teen comedies?  This is not a great film, but there is a very selected few (modern) teen flicks that I can regard as great.  So I can say this is among the elite.  It's funny, it's entertaining, it's heartfelt, it's energetic and contains a spirited cast of young actors and actresses.

33,CitizenCaine,Not As Bad As Described,6,6 July 2008,"In the pantheon of high school movies, She's All That probably isn't in the top ten, but it certainly isn't anywhere near the bottom either. Freddie Prinze plays the #1 high school jock, who isn't so sure he wants to follow in his father's footprints. His father is played by Tim Matheson in a bit of an inside joke for film buffs. Rachael Leigh Cook plays a young artistic type who begins to see the possibilities for herself. After Prinze is dumped by his high school hottie girlfriend for an MTV Real World idiot Matthew Lillard, he bets he can make a prom queen out of Rachael to replace her. Yes, the usual complications ensue, and there are several believability issues. Cook finds out about the bet and ditches Prinze, but the film is made watchable by the plethora of young, familiar faces sprinkled throughout the film. Lillard is especially obnoxious and funny as a narcissistic dolt. Sarah Michelle Gellar appears for a few seconds in a school lunch scene. The film also contains ""Kiss Me"", the infectious Sixpence None The Richer song. **1/2 of 4 stars.",She's All That

Blah Blah Blah … this is predictable, this is so unoriginal, it’s this it’s that. Well after all it was a modern version of George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion. People have been using this for years, and even won 8 Oscar for My Fair Lady, I see no one complain about that??Synopsis: Zack Siler has it all, President of his class, Captain of the team, and dating the most popular girl in school. That is until she decides to dump him for an actor. With his reputation in jeopardy Zack bet best friend that he could turn any girl into the prom queen in six week.In my point of view, I really do enjoy this movie a lot. It is a simple guy and girl’s things, and most of all I was in Jr. High when the movie was out. The story is simple, well pace, humorous, and its continuity is awesome. I have seen a whole worst in screenplay, this one is just right.The best part of this movie was the casting, and probably why it was such a hit in 1999. Freddie Prinze Jr. was truly a chick magnet at that time, and Rachel Leigh Cook was the cutest girl on the planet. The combination makes this movie a ballistic hit. And they are both awesome in the movie, Zack character is pretty charming. And other young cast also did a darn good job too. It’s all fit.Overall, it was fun teenage romantic comedy, I enjoy it, and able to watch it again and again in the boring time. The movie also consists of a pretty cool (at that time) soundtrack. The only problem was that since it been like almost a decade now, everything look dated, specially the wardrobe.Lastly, I always believe that if you’re out of age, you don’t really associate with these kind of character anymore and wouldn’t have enjoy as much as people who’s a teenager. Anyway I enjoy the movie.Recommendation: I Do Own The DVD, And I Love Watching It.Reason to Watch: Casting, Personal Liking of This Genre of Movie, Life in Late 90s’.Reason Not To: Dated, Personal Dislike of Teenage Movie.Rating: 7.5 (Grade: B-)",She's All That
42,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: For teens only, but not bad",5,5 May 2002,"""She's All That"" is a typical teen flick about coming of age, finding yourself, confidence, and so forth.

But if you're not into teen films, as I am not, skip it. You have seen this before.Who should see this film:-- Teenagers, especially girls-- Adults who dare the occasional teen flick, with nothingbetter to do on a rainy day, but firstsee ""American Pie"", which is better.I'll give ""She's All That"" a 5 out of 10, largely because of a mismatch between me and the genre.",She's All That
43,ruby_fff,"It's ""Pretty In Pink"" in the '90's -- but holds its own",6,9 March 1999,"It was on the top ten chart for weeks so I thought it's worth a theatre visit. It was not disappointing at all. I thought it's another pre-college perceived woes and teen angst movie -- it's all that: the boy-girl attractions, adolescent relationships, the rich-poor juxtaposed situations, and prom night scenario. It's really kinda ""Some Kind of Wonderful"". Rather enjoyable, actually -- even has a bit of ""My Bodyguard"" flavor.It holds its own largely attributed to the two main leads: Freddie Prinze Jr and Rachael Leigh Cook as Zach and Laney -- they do seem quite a pair together. There's also the supporting cast including Anna Paquin as Zach's sister, and Kieran Culkin as Laney's little brother, Elden Ratliff as Laney's ""nerdy"" good friend, not forgetting a very subdued performance of Laney's father from Kevin Pollak. Of course there's the two camps of followers and the soundtrack music, yet the story's told in a pretty good pace, event after event with timely interludes. Kudos to director Robert Iscove and writer R. Lee Fleming Jr. All in all a wholesome teenage tale with no violence nor sex. A family movie from Miramax.Another family movie from Miramax definitely worth seeing is ""The Mighty"" (1998, directed by Peter Chelsom), with Kieran and Elden paired together and both delivered their substantial roles brilliantly well! It's fascinating drama and superb fable-like storytelling of an ""unlikely"" indelible friendship -- there's Sharon Stone, Gena Rowlands, Harry Dean Stanton and Gillian Anderson as the ""supporting"" adult cast. I felt that this film's content is much more substantial in value than ""Simon Birch"" (1998, directed by Mark Steven Johnson), which was a good movie with solid performances from the cast all round, but the storyline is more ""Hollywood"" flavor.""Pretty In Pink"" (1986, Molly Ringwald) and ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" (1987, Mary Stuart Masterson), both directed by Howard Deutch and written by John Hughes.

Now, let me tell you something: this film is utter cr*p! I am still depressed by the theme, the acting and the generally bad script. Films like this one should be banned! The ugly duckling theme is so old by now and it's so depressing that we haven't gotten away from the ""get rid of those glasses and lets see your hidden beauty""-sh*t! Am I unfair? Well, no. Not when you consider that Laney forgives whatever-his-name-was without really asking him *why* he would hurt someone he doesn't even know like that. No, she asks him ""So, what was the bet about?"" Yeah, right. If you want to see an intelligent film about teenagers, a film that doesn't make you feel depressed afterwards, watch ""10 Things I Hate About You"" instead. Or why not ""Cruel Intentions"". Those two films are genuinely interesting and entertaining as well as well-acted. Just stay away from ""She's All That"". So, was there any good things about this film? Well, since Lil' Kim's ""Hard Core"" is the cd I've listened to the most the last six months or so I thought it was fun to see her in this film, although if I hadn't seen her name in the opening credits I wouldn't have known that she played Alex.

45,chrisbrown6453,"Well, I must say, I thought that She's All That would be a cheesy, teen angst comedy with no redeeming qualities. I was wrong.",6,21 June 2002,"It was a cheesy, teen angst comedy. But it was surprisingly fun to watch. While the story was typical, the two stars, Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachael Leigh Cook made it watchable, and they both have very bright futures ahead of them.She's All That follows the same basic plot line we've all seen millions of times over. Two guys make a bet over a girl. If one guy can transform her into a prom queen, he wins. Zach (Freddie Prinze Jr.) having just been dumped by his girlfriend for a Real World castaway (a very funny parody featuring Matthew Lillard), accepts the bet as a way of affirming his Big Man on Campus status. The girl in question is Laney Boggs (Rachel Leigh Cook), the awkward girl who likes to paint. So Zach and Laney start hanging out, having a good time, it looks like Zach will win the bet, but he's really falling for Laney, but then his friend spills the beans to her about the bet, and she gets upset, so Zach has to try and win her back, then everyone's all happy in the end. I think from the time we all saw previews for this, we all knew how it was going to end.The reason this movie was as entertaining as it was, was due to both Prinze Jr. and Cook. They have this likeable quality about them, that makes you want them to be happy together. Of course, in a film like this, all the characters are pretty stereotypical. Zach's ex-girlfriend is the most popular girl in school who treats everyone badly. Zach's best friend (the one who made the bet) is an irritating b**tard who just wants to get down every girls pants. Zach is not only the star of the soccer team, he's also the senior class President, front runner for Prom King, and of course, the most popular boy in school. And Laney is that attractive girl they keep hidden under baggy clothes and glasses so that when she ""comes out"" we're all supposed to be surprised at how this ugly duckling turned into a swan. So, as I was saying earlier, the reason this movie was entertaining was because of Prinze Jr. and Cook being able to break out of their stereotypical roles and bring a real life likeable quality to the characters. What kind of guy or girl wouldn't have fallen for these two back in high school?Also, the director pulled off a few tricks I liked. The Real World parody was dead on, with Lillard playing a Puck-like character on the Real World, then using that ""fame"" to get girls and other jobs. There were also some cool flashback scenes that were utilized to tell the story. The script itself was run of the mill, and the characters didn't really have anything original to say (although I did enjoy the fact that Laney worked at a falafel stand).The one thing that sort of bothered me about the two main stars was that they looked too far apart in age at time. I figure they're both supposed to be seniors in high school, but he looks 20, and she looks 14. Robbing the cradle came to mind a few times. And oh yeah, there's a scene in here involving a pizza and some pubic hair that was as gross if not grosser than any hair gel scene in There's Something About Mary. It had me rolling in the aisles when I saw it.She's All That was a fun movie to watch.

I'd heard of it often before - but it's so FAR outside the realm of movies that I or my friends ever saw or wanted to see - that I never thought of seeing it. I have now - and it's given me a wonderful quiet special romantic feeling this evening.The plot only somewhat resembles Pygmalion (it's really the man's sister who transforms his Galatea -- and that only in appearance). It's really a straightforward high school movie circa 1999 - with much music, the traditional high school castes and cruelty. But the screenplay is often quite funny.The movie has a BIG and positive impact however from Rachel Leigh Cook - who, manages to portray a girl bereft of her mother, from a lower middle class family, and expressing her dour pessimistic outlook on life in her art, and yet at 17 years old, has an opening - the slightest of apertures - for other possibilities. That is filled by a candid, sweet, smart, popular, handsome, athletic character played perfectly by Freddie Prinze, Jr. It's an unusual character - hugely popular, successful at everything - yet oblivious, self-doubting, rather nice and vulnerable.Cook and Prinze really do create romantic magic - with the help of a wonderful song ""Kiss Me"" sung by Sixpence None the Richer.I loved this movie - and am so glad I saw it. Cook should be in MUCH - she's special - at no point does she over-act, over-dramatize, make one feel that she is acting. She's rare.

Golly, you mean someone in the upper class could fall for some working class cretin in our utopic caste system?! Is this a sign for all to repent?! This drivel just gets worse, and at times, incoherently confusing.

52,Casey-52,Not that bad considering it's a teenie-bopper flick,7,18 September 1999,"If you look at my review dossier, you will see that most of them are horror films. I just felt compelled to review this movie. OK, I am not a fan of today's generation. They are stupid teenagers who don't have to think to get anything and are like lemmings when it comes to popularity and entertainment. That's what made TITANIC a box-office smash! But this movie is different. It is aimed at teenagers, but has potential in its acting and plotline to get beyond that. Unfortunately, it rarely takes the route. Rachel Leigh Cook is pretty good as the ugly duckling, but is very one-dimensional in most of her scenes. I am not a fan of Freddie Prinze, Jr. (his father rocked, though!), but his acting chops in this movie weren't all that bad. He shows potential to get beyond a teen idol, but like this movie, I doubt he will follow it. Anna Paquin, one of the best young actresses ever, is underused in this movie and it is in fact a disappointment to see her in this teenie flick. After starring in adult fare like THE PIANO and several other art flicks, she has now started playing type-cast teen roles. Overall, this movie was good, but still doesn't attempt to get beyond anything but a teen flick. Beware of the prom night dance sequence! What is this, a 1950's musical where everyone breaks into dance???",She's All That

I had a roommate who as a film major likes romantic comedies, which is how I ended up watching this. I could go on and on about how this piece of irresponsible junk is wrong on so many levels, but instead I'll just talk about how this film would have worked much better as a horror flick.What really should have happened is that this film should have been exactly as it is now, except every single character gets brutally killed. If Freddie Prinze Jr. was just decapitated at some point, with tons of blood then this would have been a worthwhile movie. If Rachael Leigh Cook (who looks AMAZINGLY stupid at all times in real life as well as on film - what the hell is with her forehead? She has to be some kind of hybrid alien/human the result of all those alien impregnation abductions you always hear about) was stabbed with rusty nails and glass repeatdly, then forced to go to the big dance like that, this movie would have been a whole lot more interesting. And then there's Usher. He should have just been blown up by large explosives.If the director had implemented these suggestions, it would have been a MUCH more enjoyable movie.

And even as such, it fails miserably, because, if nothing else, it should AT LEAST be mildly amusing (if not funny), but there is ZERO humour in this stinker.It's not funny, it's not romantic, it's not realistic, it's not heart-warming, it's not dramatic, it's not... anything. It's just boing, lame, predictable, and annoying.The acting is nothing short of ATROCIOUS. Look at these people! How do they get acting jobs? I wouldn't cast them as extras in made-for-TV flicks! They're really, really, really bad. No, not just the leads; all of them! I shouldn't even bring up the fact that this ""movie"" defines the term ""predictable""; it goes without saying. I guarantee you have not seen anything as disgustingly predictable and cheesy as this.No one deserves to be subjected to such moronic bulls***. It insults human intelligence.

The only thing that makes Cook's character a nerd that must be looked down upon is that she wears glasses. Literally, all that happens is that she gets a hair cut and takes off her glasses, and suddenly she is transformed into a great beauty.The subplot here involves Prinze's character not wanting to accept that he must grow up, face his father and pick a college. The rest is kind of blah, except for Matthew Lillard as the ex-Real Worlder who has taken Prinze's girlfriend. He is a scene stealer.

Maybe because I would very much like to be that young again to prevent some fatal mistakes. Be that as it may, I am very open-minded to teenage comedies. I love most of them.
Nut now what have we here? A film right out of this genre that really bored me. The story and the characters lacks the power necessary to incite this typical teen charme humor - the kind of humor you just relax, sit back and enjoy the ride. In this movie, something does not work together. Is it the fact that Freddie Prince Junior looks absolutely out of place? Is it that the finale is simply boring instead of chaotic and exciting? Is it that there have been too many much funnier teen comedies lately (American Pie, Road Trip...)?All in all, a movie you can forget immediately after viewing.

58,Ziglet_mir,Super Flawed but Charming Nonetheless,7,14 April 2020,"Sometimes when you open up to people, you let the bad in with the good.I'm not trying to fool anyone here by attempting to make an unironic argument for why this film is any semblance of amazing because it isn't. This isn't the sexy, sleek kale shake. Nor is it Nonna Marie's elegant and decadent chocolate soufflé. This is the goddamned beautiful, golden twinkie staring straight at you from the pantry shelf at 3:00 AM or that week-old triple-chunk box brownie left sitting in the pan on your kitchen counter; you know you probably shouldn't have it but you do. And it is even more delicious than your hunger was telling you. It's still real rough around the edges, it definitely isn't of respected homemade quality and it may have some hairs in it. But while it may be all those things it's something that lures you back with some sort of infinite charm. Excuse my really long (and probably unnecessary food analogy) but it perfectly encapsulates how I feel about 1999's She's All That.I just spent 95 min watching something I would have never given the light of day and yet here I am writing a positive review.Generally, the acting is subpar but dont let the ass-awful title fool you. Freddie Prince Jr has some chops and Kevin Pollack literally steals every scene he's in (it may potentially be the best work he's ever done and I'm not throwing shade). The gorgeous Rachel Leigh Cook is unbelievable to be cast as the school nerd (she's too pretty even with glasses) and her acting isn't polished by any means, but she seems to adapt gravitas depending on who she shares a scene with. There are two scenes of note: ""Am I a fucking bet?!"" And Pollack's fatherly ""Do it for you"" scene that show this film has its worth. The film tries too hard with some college subplots and fails miserably but it's easily overlooked. Overall, I couldn't believe the number of faces my wife and I recognized as we made fun of the styles and trends, laughed a little and fell prey to the setting of the late 90s.She's All That really doesn't hold much to 1999's other coming of age hit 10 Things I Hate About You (that also has a major bet as its plot device) as the acting, directing and writing are all better in spades, but once again, there's that silly iresistable charm I keep referring to.Can any respectable dude not crush on RLC after watching this? Or laugh their ass off at Matthew Lillard's actually amazing self-degrading comedic turn? Or Freddie Prinze Jr doing an arthouse segment with a hackysack? Or maybe it's a naked FPJ tossing a volleyball as his only cover to the girl he loves? How about hearing ""whatev"" or ""wigged out"" used in serious conversation?I suppose I can't convince everyone about it's charm but goddamn if you wont ever catch me sneaking a Twinkie at 3:00 AM.",She's All That
59,ian_harris,You've almost certainly already got this tee-shirt,4,4 October 2002,"So predictable, so derivative.  This film came recommended but I feel that the recommendation was misplaced.  Taming of the Shrew has been remade many times but in some cases (Pygmalion, My Fair Lady) new eras and genres add something.  In this case, we have ""taming meets teen-movie"" - nothing is added, only taken away.Cook is very watchable, but she's no shrew which somewhat side-steps the point.  And as for having a chip on your shoulder about the jet-setters when you're a teenager living in a house with a huge basement that you can monopolise as your art studio and a swimming pool in the garden.  Please. At least in Pretty in Pink the poverty was more relative and somewhat absolute (although even then, if you can afford a car and have a job........). Unless you have never seen a teen movie and/or never seen a remake of Taming, you've already got this tee-shirt many times over so this movie is not worth the 90 minute wait for the closing credits.

61,sngbrd39,Why I can't stand this movie,1,7 January 2006,"This movie was one of the glut of teen ""comedies"" that came out in the late '90s/early '00s, spurred on by the success of American Pie and its ilk. Generally, these movies weren't any good. It made me sad to be a high schooler during that period of time. Why couldn't I have grown up with Say Anything... ten years earlier, or Grease twenty years earlier? Not that they were great works of film-making, but at least they were enjoyable. But I digress. Although I'm not a huge fan of the genre in general, I reserve a special disdain for She's All That for the following reasons: 1. It's a bad rip-off of the Pygmalion story. Now, while it's fine to do updates on classic literature, and indeed, the Pygmalion story would be a good one to update, it's not fine to dumb it down. This felt like the ""reaching for the lowest common denominator"" version of My Fair Lady, except with a much worse soundtrack. The humor level went from ""C'mon Dover, move yer bloomin' arse!"" to ""What did he just put on that pizza??"" 2. It's a celebration of conformity. It's not so much the physical makeover that gets to me (even though I talk about that a bit more below); it's the accompanying change of personality. When Laney becomes her ""cooler"" self (gag, gag, gag!!), she loses pretty much all of the quirky qualities of her personality that made her interesting in the beginning of the movie. She pretty much became just like everyone else, which was saddening. At least in the original Pygmalion story, Eliza became a stronger person after her transformation; Laney just becomes a gooey-eyed bimbo.3. Speaking of eyes, this movie perpetuates a bias against people who wear glasses, saying that they're automatically nerdy and unattractive and must get contacts STAT! if they want any hope of being cool and good-looking. (Sorry, just a personal pet peeve of mine; it just gets on my nerves, especially because I know people who think this way in real life.) 4. C'mon, this transformation was too easy. As a lot of other reviewers have pointed out, Laney was already pretty. All they did was slap on some quirky clothing and glasses (see point #3), and she was automatically in need of a makeover to make her hot. Right. You know, sometimes the people that really stand out are the ones considered the most beautiful. But that seems to be lost on anyone here, who think that you have to look just like everyone else to be attractive. They could have picked a better ""project"" or ""case"" to make over.Anyway, these are my thoughts. I'm not even going to touch on the awful acting and the fact that high school was never remotely like it was portrayed in this movie (a high school radio station??). I just have problems with this movie at the foundational level.As a final thought, may I just submit for your consideration that the title is a phrase so dated that, a mere 7 years later, no one really uses it anymore? Clearly, there was something very short-sighted in the making of this movie.",She's All That
62,Phantasm01,Good teen flick...not much more..don't expect Oscar greatness or anything,8,1 August 2006,"Let's get one thing straight before I make my critique: for those who are expecting an earnest depiction of high school students and high school life, look elsewhere. ""She's All That"" is as over-the-top as it can get and the movie ironically contains random jokes and parodies about supposedly realistic programs as well, namely the MTV-spawned reality show ""The Real World"" and its progeny series ""Road Rules"". This movie is all in good fun but it does manage to hint at a good deal of real life trifles that particular people suffer in that highly-influential and barely survivable place that we geeks and outsiders call ""high school"". Well, maybe not ""high school"" (probably closer to HELL), but anyone who was picked on or unjustifiably ostracized gets the picture.The endearing Rachael Leigh Cook and Freddie Prinze, Jr. star in this sugary ditty about a dude named Zack Silar (Prinze) who is ditched by his long-time armpiece Taylor Vaughn (O'Keefe) only six weeks before the prom. He suffers public humiliation in front of his jock companions and, moreover, the entire school. His less-than-sympathetic pal Dean (Walker) proposes a bet which the illustrious school president can't pass up: Dean will hand-pick the geekiest girl in the school and within the time allotted, Zack must transform her into a mega-babe and make her more than eligible for the elite status of prom queen. The deal is on and within only two minutes of searching, the ""scary and inaccessible"" Laney Boggs (Cook) makes her appearance by falling flat on her face in the courtyard - Dean has found his guinea pig. From here, Prinze and Cook do the traditional and recycled theme of geek-to-goddess. Suspension of disbelief is a pre-requisite for this transformation - the pretty and petite Cook is hardly an ugly duckling by any standard, her luminous brown eyes and almost pixie-ish beauty a complete distraction, even when she is supposed to look mousy (tortoiseshell glasses, stringy hair, sloppy clothes, etc.). Prinze comes off humble and sweet even when he is trying to be suave and arrogant, but this doesn't ruin anything. We rather want to see him that way because we want to believe that he really does care about Laney and that his reputation is the last thing on his mind. Prinze does this remarkably well. Matthew Lillard of ""Scream"" fame is a riot as a fictitious Real World cast member Brock Landers, a character that is obviously modeled from the obnoxious and insensitive Puck from Real World San Francisco. Of course, he's a lot more likable because his character is a complete farce and Lillard almost steals the show. Almost unbearable is Paul Walker as Dean Sampson, the narcissistic jock who places the bet with Zack and manipulates it in his favor. Walker's delivery is so forced and obtuse that one would believe that is truly HIS nature and not just his character. Jodi Lyn O'Keefe is a comedic queen as the vacuous Taylor Vaughn, and Kieran Culkin and Eldin Ratliff are again part of the same cast list (The Mighty) but this time as Laney's younger brother Simon and her best friend Jesse, respectively. If you watch closely during a particular lunchroom scene, you will see Prinze's wife and ""Buffy"" TV star Sarah Michelle Gellar make a brief cameo.",She's All That
63,poem,"Good funny teenage movie, especially for girls",8,9 November 1999,"This is a good entertaining movie, without big faults. Well maybe it doesn't reach the fun level of movies such as ""Clueless""; people which like movies to be more realistic and serious, might however like this one even more than the Alicia Silverstone thing.With Freddy Prince Jr., they have casted an absolute Prince Charming, so I think girls/women will like this movie very much, just because he is in it. He and Rachael Leight Cook made a really cute lover pair. Rachael is wearing a bikini in one scene... - and Freddy Prince wears even less in another.The jokes in this movie are really strange; I often couldn't laugh about them. For example, these ""hey darling I have improved my social position so byebye""-joke, which appears twice in the movie, is just braindamaged. Or this actor which behaves so supercrazy and compares himself with Marlon Brando - that guy nerves. Or when Laney paints in Misty's face while she's lying around drunk, what should that mean ?

64,Joejoesan,One of the best movies in its genre,9,22 August 2008,"I just saw this movie for the sixth or seventh time on television and I wondered what Rachael Leigh Cook was doing these days. So I checked the IMDb and to my amazement I saw that this movie is rated with a miserable 5.4! What the hell? In my opinion She's all that is one of the best movies in it's teenager/highschool/romcom genre. The story is comfortable predictable and all the performances (from Freddy Prinze to Rachel Leigh Cook and even Matthew Lillard - who's pretty hilarious) are great. We also find Paul Walker (pretty scary!) and Anna Paquin in one of their earlier roles.Director Robert Iscove also has some nice visual surprises in store for us. The way he introduces the Florida flashback at the pool may be lent from Tucker: A man and his dream, but it works very well. One of the best parts is the dance scene to the music of Fat Boy Slim at the end of the movie. The choreography is excellent and the camera-work first rate. I think that scene is an absolute classic (especially since it wasn't even planned to be in the movie).All in all She's all that is pretty underrated, I think. It's difficult to make a good romantic movie, I know. I love the genre, but the only ones that really survive the test of time can be counted on one hand. Rob Reiner's The Sure Thing and When Harry Met Sally are up there. Garry Marshall's Frankie and Johnny, Ang Lee's Sense & Sensibility, The Notebook and Simon West's Pride & Prejudice also come to mind.She's all that may not be a classic like the movies I mentioned before, but there's more to that movie than you would think after first seeing it.A miserable 5.4...

65,quiqueperezsoler,Overrated and poorly written compared to other similar makeover teen rom-comedies. It fails when it tries to be deep,6,21 April 2020,"I love teen romantic comedies from the 90s and 2000s, I think they are unique, over the top and at times cynical products of their time. Nevertheless, I'm one to believe in some way most of them are still relevant today if looked passed the Hollywood flashy wrapping it comes with most of the times. However, this movie exemplifies exactly the cliched problems of the genre by poorly executing the really interesting themes it presented.Surely in movies of the same genre scenarios and situations related to teenage love, self-awareness and social construct found in real life are portrayed in order for the audience to empathise with the characters. However most of the movies do so with a different voice and saying something new while making use of the familiar tropes characteristic of their genre. Tropes being made fun of in parody movies like ""Not another teen movie"" where the cliched used of this tropes are ridiculized for how stereotypical and sometimes objectifying they can be. It should be enough proof of the harm this movie does to the genre the fact that this parody movie holds several scenes referring to the same scenes of the movie making fun of how unnatural and offensive they come across.She's all that(1999) was a promising movie with a great cast of entertaining characters that somewhat felt badly-realised and poorly written. The unconvincing supposed angst of the female lead and the supposed despite-the-jock-image-he-is-a-real-person-underneath arc of the male lead are two examples of poorly written characters that prevent interesting scenarios in the story to have the impact they intended. These roles have been portrayed before in better executed movies like Drive Me Crazy(1999), 10 Things I hate about you(1999), A walk to remember(2002) and even Princess Diaries(2001) and Breakfast Club(1985); with similar beats revolving around makeover scenes, fitting in, winning a bet, breaking the high school hierarchy and opening up to someone. The performance of the male lead was dull and lacking but this might have to do with his poorly written character, at times he had nothing to say when he should have said something or interceded and other times it chose poor words to express his feelings (even a joked was played in his expense because of it and it doesn't come across as funny). The romance is carried in the shoulders of the female lead who gives an incredible performance as well as the rest of her family.IN CONCLUSION, the movie is an entertaining, light-hearted and poorly written movie. It has definitely something to say in regards to parental and peer pressure, coping with the death of a loved one and even expressing what you feel before it's too late; but it fails when it tries to make those message get through the audience because of the sometimes unfunny humor, random musical numbers and some additional subplots that have no weight in the central plot. It surely is yet ""another teen romantic comedy"" yet it falls flat amongst other similar and better executed movies that came out at the same time. It's a pity",She's All That

Can't Hardly Wait, I Know What You Did Last Summer plus I Still Know, Disturbing Behavior, The Faculty, Urban Legend, Varsity Blues, 10 Things..., Teaching Mrs. Tingle, etc. They still try to cash in with this lame attempt at the high school life with college aged kids playing high schoolers. The dialogue is gut wrenchingly bad because of how it tries to go with our generation. The storywriting is the worst of it as we're supposed to believe this is a sweet Cinderella-esque story when it's nothing more than a blatant attempt at trying to get to the youth market.

67,great_sphinx_42,Sorta cute but forgettable.....kinda like Freddie Prinze Jr.....,4,11 April 2001,"Recipe for 'She's All That': mix 1 part 'Never Been Kissed', 1 part '10 Things I Hate About You' and 1 part 'Pygmallion', with a dash of the Farrelly brothers (for the utterly disgusting pubic hair pizza scene), add a lot of water and mix until it's vaguely familiar yet still unidentifiable watered-down mush. Freddie Prinze Jr. is Zach, a wildly popular and admired high school senior who gets dumped by his Queen Bitch girlfriend, Taylor (the very voluptous Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) after she meets Brock, a Puck-like creature from The Real World, during Spring Break at the MTV Beach House. The character of Brock is one of the two highlights, played by the ever-entertaining Matthew Lillard. The other highlight is Rachel Leigh Cook, despite the rather ridiculous assertion that a girl this gorgeous could manage to be the school loser. They didn't even do a good job of masking her beauty, as they did with Drew Barrymore in 'Never Been Kissed'. Beautiful as Drew is, they managed to uglify her in the flashbacks scenes enough that you could believe that young Josie Geller was a geek. Here, they basically just stuck thick glasses on Rachel, and she's far too pretty a girl for that to work. Despite that strain on suspended reality, she has a certain prickly charm- her dark eyes flashing in her tiny face, smirkingly throwing Zach on stage in the one place he's entirely out of his league, stomping up like a midget warrior princess to stand face-to-cleavage with Taylor. I should also add here that although Ms. O'Keefe's performance can't really be called a highlight, she handles her thankless role with skill. This movie really seems to have attracted a lot of names in supporting roles- Usher, Lil' Kim, Anna Paquin, Paul Walker, Gabrielle Union, Kevin Pollak, the young man who played Pnub in 'Idle Hands' and his costar from 'The Mighty', Kieran Culkin. Usher and Lil' Kim did little to distinguish themselves here, other than causing me to remember just how young Lil' Kim is. Anna Paquin has a wonderful quality about her (especially evident in her performance in 'Almost Famous') that shines even here in her small, one-note role as makeup artist- a sort of sly, knowing good humor peering from the corners of her eyes, mixed with a petulant vulnerability. Sensuality is in her also, and it could be dangerous. Paul Walker was much better as a doofy dream boy in 'Pleasantville' than he is here as Zach's jerk buddy. Freddie Prinze Jr. is actually the perfect sort of actor to play Zach- cute, generic, likable and harmless. The sort of boy you'd like in high school and forget the first day of college. The movie doesn't end quite like you expect it to and, ironically, this one strike of originality was something I didn't like. Not to reveal too much, but while it's all good and well that we can't have the fairy tale ending with Zach and Laney getting crowned Prom King and Queen, I think they should have been reversed. I'll also add that I'm sorely tempted to try making a teen movie myself for no reason other than to gain evidence that there actually exist some ideas for teen movies that don't climax at the friggin' prom. I think I'll have my teen movie's climax take place at the Christmas dance.",She's All That

Personally I enjoyed the late Heath Ledgers' take on this story as old as time, though the female lead in this one added a bit more naivety to the role.Surprised to see the late Paul Walker not playing a squeaky clean character, and the rest of the stereotypes in every high school flick make a small addition to the story. As I cannot view this film in the past, when I was the age it targets, I cannot judge it for what it really is: a slapstick romcom to pass the time! That it depicts bullies, wannabee-rapists, suicidal goths and alcohol-abusing rich kids as the standard to which one should aspire- until you meet an outcast that'll teach you the important things in life, like bad plays (huh?)-is superfluous when you've got the spunky leads trying to make it, or make out, or make do through the short 94 minutes or so of film!

70,miss_lady_ice-853-608700,She's Not Bad,7,7 February 2014,"For all the people complaining that Rachel Leigh Cook is pretty anyway, that's the whole point. Zach does not change Laney; she was always pretty but just didn't give herself the chance. This isn't a film about turning an ugly girl into a pretty girl; rather a film about putting yourself out there and allowing yourself to be pretty. To pick an unattractive actress to transform would send out the message that the only way you will ever be accepted is if you tart yourself up.The premise is quite thin and perhaps a more severe transformation would have been more entertaining but Freddie Prince Junior, as Zach, the jock who makes a bet that he can't transform the geekiest girl in the school Laney (Rachel Leigh Cook) into prom queen is charismatic and has nice chemistry with Cook. There are also some entertaining minor characters, such as Zach's sister (played by Anna Paquin) and Laney's brother.There is one gross-out scene that feels a little out of place in what is quite a gentle story about coming out from your shell; I wouldn't really describe this as a rom-com.

A good guy jock tries to make a prom queen from a sensitive geeky girl to win a bet. Problems are caused by his earlier girlfriend, who is brain-between-legs-type, heartless and trashy, and who has already found a new guy, a sleazy reality show celebrity.

72,Ysman,All I can say is attend the movie with low expectations.,4,31 January 1999,"John Hughes had it right.  Focus the story on the teenage angst and the trials and heartaches that all kids have in high school.  Show that even the most popular guy/girl in school has problems too.  Briefly describe the uninteresting sub-plots involving an overbearing father and best friends that will turn their back on you the minute you stray from the norm.  Do not, however, put these characters or these scenarios on film.  What do you have? A movie that may not be Oscar caliber, but will at least stay in the minds of the audience long after the drive home.  With that said, She's All That wasn't horrible.  The leads had no chemistry, the evil villain did not receive her just desserts and the final scene was dropped flat, unsatisfying in every way.  But with a movie that has, what could be, the worst movie title in the history of film, what could I really expect?",She's All That
73,Rhino Rover,Drags on.,3,24 July 1999,"This review is probably a little late but something told me to wait until this movie came out on video. I finally rented the movie last night and afterwards regretted my decision. I do have to admit that I am a few years removed from my high school years but I'm not that far removed that I couldn't relate.The movie follows a very predictable teen romance formula and the ending is predictable within the first 5 minutes. Despite that, I continued to watch. The plot revolves around your typical 'in crowd' jock (Prinze) taking on a bet to convert your 'ugly duckling'(Cook) type character into the school queen. There's little sense in giving any more of a summary than that. There are some slight variations but nothing that I would consider really original. The story drags in quite a few parts where you tend to lose interest and in some cases, you could probably walk away from the movie for 20 minutes and come back and not miss a thing.The best performance was given by Cook (Laney) but despite her performance, I found the character completely unbelievable. Cook is a very pretty girl and putting a pair of big glasses and a long haired wig (which was very obvious) on her cannot hide that fact. Maybe some additional makeup (or even lack of it) hiding her looks would have added to her character's look but with the way she was presented, it was incredibly obvious that she was going to look beautiful once a few changes were made.Freddie Prinze doesn't give all that stirring a performance. I've seen him now in two movies (this one and Wing Commander) and his performances were almost identical, which is to say, he doesn't have a very large range. His looks and his smile are getting him by right now but those attributes will only take him so far. Mathew Lillard has played identical type characters in both this movie and Wing Commander and I found him completely annoying in both. There are a few laughs here and there but nothing that would be all that memorable. If any of you do want to see this movie, my suggestion would be to rent it. That way you have to option of turning it off and doing something else.",She's All That

75,DJ_Shilo,Teen Misfire,4,17 August 2019,"I'm so sick of seeing these high school teenage comedies where dorky girls are portrayed as ""losers"" and ""ugly ducklings"" because they are smart and not the high school ""hot girls."" Dorky girls are sweethearts and the film can't center on that aspect, instead opting for a stupid story about the ""ugly duckling"" turning in to a queen while trying to find herself. ""She's All That"" is a failed attempt at an 80's comedy that is unfunny, predictable and shamefully stupid. Here's a news flash, I like the dorky girl in this movie and she is the only good thing about it. Does that make me a dork?It's about a rich high school hothead, Zack (Freddie Prinze Jr.) who is dumped by his idiot and self-centred girlfriend, Taylor (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) after returning from spring break with, Brock (Matthew Lillard). Fearing his legacy as prom king is on the line, his equal idiot friends, Dean (Paul Walker) and Jesse (Elden Henson) make a bet with him that he can't turn someone into a prom queen in six weeks. His target becomes a sweet girl named, Laney Boggs (Rachel Leigh Cook) who unknowingly walks into Zack's plan as he attempts to convince her to go to the prom with him. Zack soon finds himself falling for Laney and as the prom nears, he tries to convince her that he is more than just a high school jock and that she means something to him.Why is there a scene in this movie with Matthew Lillard farting on a TV show? Why do I have to see some high school girl picking a wedge? Is this supposed to be funny? Just before you see Laney drop her books on the ground, Zack and his friends make the bet with him and one of the friends says ""Let's go shopping."" How nice! Paul Walker is the villain of the film which he fails at. As you can probably tell, I'm not all for the egotistical jocks who think they are gods because they play football or have a rich mommy and daddy and that is actually what Zack is and it takes a stupid bet to make him see that he isn't an A*****e? Yeah, okay.Zack attempts to court Laney throughout most of the second act with stupid characters getting in the way to create that teen comedy-drama atmosphere when everything seems fine for a moment and something stupid happens. I was also trying to figure Zack out at this point because his character is shallow and not written well. He seems to still be attempting to win the bet even though he tries to get to know Laney more because maybe he is falling for her? I don't think he is smart enough to realize that he has an adorable girl in front of him and the screenplay has to stretch the running time to the end before we can finally see Zack as somewhat of a human character when all the sudden he realizes he has fallen for Laney and his friends are idiots.There is a scene where they all play volleyball on the beach and one of the characters sees Laney in her bathing suit and he says ""from up here she looks normal."" This is just mean spirited for the sake of what? Attempting to be funny? It's not funny. Shortly after, Zack has his sister, Mackenzie (Anna Paquin) give Laney a full makeover and she walks down the stairs to ""Sixpence none the Richers"" song ""Kiss Me"" and reveals her new look. I get the emotional aspect of Laney. She has self-esteem issues and she thinks she is not worth anyone's time when she is a pretty girl who is very smart and it takes Zack half the movie to figure this out. There is a revelation about Laney that will tug on the heartstrings. It has to do with why she shuts people out of her life. Rachel Leigh Cook is an adorable actress who plays Laney with sass and wit and she is the heart and soul of the movie.Surprisingly, the third act is where most of the movie is sweet and I was hoping It could redeem itself and it sort of does. I still have a hard time believing that the dorky girl changed the high school Jock into a sweetheart but she does and the movie has a better ending than I expected. Laney ends up at the prom with Dean after he reveals the big secret to screw Zack over and he screws him over because Laney is now ""hot"" and he likes her after spending most of the movie-making fun of her? Gimmie a break! I do think it is sweet how Zack helps Laney find herself and she is happy with a smile at the end. It is kind of heartwarming but the more I saw the film coming to an end with a different Zack I could believe he fell in love with her. It made me realize that if we had of just gotten a better movie that wasn't mean spirited and was not centred-around stupid characters, this might have been a better film. The film does have it's heart in the right place but it's not enough when we have an adorable character that is surrounded by stupidity and we wish for a better movie because of her.",She's All That

We watched it in Media Studies at school and for me it was the first time I had watched it from start to finish and I actually found it pretty damn boring. What happens: Zach, the most popular boy in school (what else d'ya expect?!) makes a bet with his pals that he can take arty geek girl Laney (Rachael Leigh Cook in her first movie role), doll her up and take her to the prom (again, what else d'ya expect he was gonna take her to, behind the dumpster?!). Laney finds out that she's a bet (SHOCK! HORROR!) ,gets all angry and walks out on Zach. Shortly there afterward, they make nice and get together. One person said that ol' Rachael Leigh was beautiful in it ; but in my opinion, short hair does NOT look good on her at all. My Media Studies teacher said that this movie is just jam packed with stereotypes and I strongly agree with her. The movie contains: jocks, cheerleader princesses, geeks, token black guys, you name it, ""She's All That"" has it.

That he can get the dorkiest girl at school and turn her into the prom queen. That girl is Laney(Rachel Leigh Cook) pretty soon they talk and he makes he turns her from an ""ugly"" Duckling into a beautiful swan. i wn't spoil the rest but you know what happens.The one thing i didn't like about this movie was laney wasn't ugly to begin with in fact she was quite beautiful. i hate when movies have a beautiful actress play someone ugly when she's not.Major props go to the cast because they make this movie. freddie Prinze jr is much better 9in this than he was in I know  what you did last summer. maybe the guy took acting classes or something. but he has the charm and now the talent to oull off a good performance.

80,MissCzarChasm,Harmless,7,25 August 2001,"The Story:She's All That is nothing to take seriously at all. It's a harmless little film that serves it's 90 minute entertainment value. I wasn't bored, i wasn't too impressed but i could handle watching the film and accepting it for what it is: a harmless teen film.The plot is pretty simple. The most popular guy in school has just been dumped by his girlfriend and to prove that he can make anyone like her he takes his friends on a bet that he can turn the dorkiest girl in high school into the new prom queen. Of course they hat each other in the beginning and like any romantic comedy they begin to like each other when their relationship begins to progress. You can probably guess how this one ends.
The Acting:Freddie Prinze Jr: I can't tell if he's a bad actor or if he just picks material that is totally beneath him. He was terrible in I Know What You Did Last Summer but in his roles that followed that picture he got a lot better. He has major screen presence here and considering the material he carry's himself quite well.Rachel Leigh Cooke: She's the soul of this film. If not for her i don't think i would've liked it as much. She's a very capable actress and i hope she finds material that is truly worthy of her talent.Paul Walker: i guess he wans't too bad in this film but his talent is completely minimal. He isn't anything too special. The average high schooler with no talent could've played this part though.Jodi Lynn O'keffe: she basically played the female equivalent of paul walker's character, but with a little more sass. She isn't too bad in this film but it doesn't speak well of her talent when she basically plays the same part in the film Whatever it Takes.Anna Paquin: Her character is way too small. She's actually pretty good in her few scenes however. I've always thought she was pretty talented. Wish her character could've had more to doMatthew Lillard: He's quite funny in his scenes. I've always thought he was a  pretty good actor. I also wish he would chose better material that is worthy of his talent. Too bad his current film ism Summer Catch.There are some pretty funny scenes as well. The Dance sequence at the prom is pretty fun and done with a lot of energy. Also pretty funny are real sequences. I thought those were pretty clever. The rest of the film is the same generic harmeless teen stuff that isn't too smart but something i can't really hate.",She's All That

People will argue that it doesn't bother them, but what about others? They might take that message on board and suppress a talent they might have inside of them, like Cook's character did.On top of that: bad acting, bad scriptwriting, bad MTV type direction, predictable.

85,Undead_Master,Perfect execution proves that originality is overrated,8,11 September 2006,"For some odd reason this movie seems to get a lot of grief. Perhaps it's a common tendency to read political meaning into films that don't merit that kind of examination, or maybe it's an intolerance for old fashioned story's, but it's totally undeserved in this case.There have been a million movies made with this same story... It's probably older than time. Two excellent (and very different) movies come to mind right away... Brian De-Palma's Carrie"" and John Hughes' Pretty in pink. I think this movie is almost as good and certainly in the same league. It may be slightly lesser than those two, but not by much.Several ingredients come together to make this movie excellent and put it at the top of the heap among 90's teen comedy's. First of all there's the chemistry between the two leads. Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachael Leigh Cook mesh perfectly as a couple. As you watch the film you want them to get together and you want things to work out between them. Secondly, Cook's performance and screen presence are exceptional. She is very believable and her character grounds the film, saving it from it's sillier moments.The final ingredient is the director... Robert Iscove seems to have superior talent. He's not flashy and in many ways his style is invisible but if you really watch the movie, nearly every scene is brilliantly executed, especially the quieter moments and the most important scenes where the story shifts.

And permanent.How could they try to adapt one classic, 'My Fair Lady', for teen audience? What were they thinking? And with such a bad cast! Freddie Prinze Jr. is the most inexpressive and silly actor of that generation and Rachel Lee Cook is so ordinary. Why don't they look at Reese Witherspoon, one young actress that do really good movies? Why don't they follow her example? Or at least try, because, obviously, one good director would never accept these two in his movie.The soundtrack, the photography and the screenplay (of course) are so bad. Well, that's enough, I'll not write anything else about 'She's All That'. Let's write about one good movie, 'Cruel Intentions'.The unique adaptation with young cast that's very good is the audacious 'Cruel Intentions'. There, they were not afraid of doing a really hot and original movie, with profanities, sex, bad attitudes, etc. The director, Roger Kumble, did what he wanted to do, without interventions or adaptations to receive one PG-13 rating.That may look obvious, but I'll write it anyway: don't spend your money in this crap. I'm not saying that anyone that watch this movie will hate it but think a little: with so many masterpieces to rent, all Stanley Kubrick's movies available, gripping films of Hitchcock on video, etc, why rent this?

What would you do to your enemy if you two were in a bathroom together, and your enemy are unconscious on the floor? Something a lot more satisfying than giving them a clown-like makeover.

It had a lot of promise, especially due to the talented young actors who star in it.  But overall, I deemed it nothing really special, just relatively average.  Take the main character, played by Rachael Leigh Cook.  When she was initially presented in the movie, I saw no need for her to be transformed at all.  She is a thoughtful, creative person who has found a way to avoid peer pressure and become pleased with herself as a person.  Do we really need to see this tired formula again?  I have seen this type of movie dozens of times before... guy meets girl... girl gets makeover... guy falls for girl.  This movie puts no additional spin on the formula.  A lot of the characters I found very annoying, such as Jodi Lyn O'Keefe and Matthew Lillard, those who I'm sure are capable of much better material in the future.  The few things that I did enjoy about this movie were the chemistry between Cook and Freddie Prinze, Jr. as well as the excellent dance sequence to Fatboy Slim's ""The Rockefeller Skank"".  To sum it all up, this movie definitely isn't the worst movie that I have seen, but I would certainly put many more on the top of my list in front of it.",She's All That

100,BatmanAndRobyn,Pretty good.,6,28 June 2013,"As a fan of all those ""late 90's teenage predictable chick-flicks,"" I thought this movie was pretty good. Compared to others in the same category however, it's definitely not the strongest. The story is predictable: the popular guy makes a bet claiming that he'll be able to make the school's biggest loner/outcast the prom queen. And, of course, by the end they fall for one another. Not a big surprise, but the story is still really fun to follow. With many witty one- liners, there were many laughable moments. However, as a hopeless romantic, my favorite part is the one where Zach and Laney have a close conversation concerning her late mother. I thought Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachel Leigh Cook worked really well together. The movie got REALLY cheesy at certain parts, not because of the lines (which also occasionally happened), but because of the character delivery. However, I never thought either of the leads overdid it. They had good chemistry and I enjoyed watching the two of them. Although it's not the best film of this sort that I've seen, I still enjoyed it and I'm glad I finally watched it. I would recommend it if you're having a girls night or are just in the mood for a 90's film.",She's All That

Hence, we knew the story, the ending, and the basic plot twists.
The interest would be in the character development, the mini-plots and twists, directorial style, and writer's wit.There was some originality here, the recounting of Spring Break by having characters walking through it was a bonus.""May I supersize your falafel"" was another nice touch. The dude from the real world was also pretty cool.Positives aside, I didn't ever really care for the characters. I wanted to, but they just weren't written that way.

Without looking like a fool? So I settled back and resolved to hate She's all that! Except something unexpected happened. I had few hopes of even keeping down my popcorn, but suddenly I found myself liking it. The female lead was implausably gorgeous to ever fool anyone with the ugly duckling act, but that wasn't the point.

I don't agree with the ones complaining about the fast-changing of Laney-OK, it's alittle fast but tell me, did you see 'Grease'? Or know the scene at the fair?

115,gregg-39,Average.,6,6 May 2001,"Despite some good performances from the two leads, without them this would be a pretty poor film. The story is poor and predictable with an unnatural sounding script a lot of the time, typical of these US teen movies, although it does have a few instances of credibility.The main problem, however, is that it just isn't very funny most of the time, a problem for a 'comedy'!!! The Grease inspired dancing at the 'prom' seems out of place, and the characters are just too one-dimensional.  I really dislike the constant bombarding of teen films portraying High School life in such a stereotypical way, and with the constant obsession of the importance of getting being these 'perfect' students.....planning for the perfect future, total emphasis on a love life (have you ever noticed how in nearly all these films the kids get into the few top Universities, and how despite being only 18 at most they have Dawson Creek style meaningful 'relationships'.School just isn't as clean cut in segregating student types (geeks, jocks e.t.c), and the problems and aims of teenage life are much more complex and diverse than all these films show.  American Pie managed to overcome these similar types of flaws because it had that single advantage of being a much more constantly funny film.........with the internet scene!!!!!!!!!!!!!",She's All That

Ok, she started her career with this movie, before that she was hardly known in Hollywood but the story is more than awful, I know why the director hasn't made any other film yet. Although being very bad the film has it's moments, like the mixing of the school and the pool at the beginning, and the program ""Real World L.A."" being broadcasted with the character of the movie, but that isn't enough, there are a lot of things bad explained, want examples? Why no one liked Laney before - except the fat one - but she gets 46% of the votes?, why the bad guys who spoiled the pizza were forced to eat it, weren't they two against one? Of course, worst than that is: why is Sarah Michelle Gellar at that school and wasn't nominated to be prom queen? I think that Freddie Prinze Jr. enjoyed making it or he wouldn't be also in ""Boys and Girls"" another as bad as this one.The only good think I can say about the movie is that I've discovered that Rachael Leigh Cook (who is fabulous is AntiTrust, a must see computer movie) is left-handed like me.",She's All That

As the film started it set itself out in much the way you'd expect. Most popular boy in school with most popular girl in school, he gets dumped, his mates bet him to pull the most unattractive girl etc. There is absolutely no new ground broken with this film at all. Even the films director only manages an average job (see how many times you spot the sound boom in shot).But for some reason you sit down and enjoy this film from beginning to end. The cast is great. I would of expected a better performance from Screams Matt Lillard, but aside from that everyone is great. Its thanks to the people in this film that the succeeds. They are able to produce the feel good factor, the mushiness that's required.In my opinion this film is only beaten by the superb Notting Hill for this years crown of best romantic comedy.

121,winsfordtown,Lost the plot,5,28 January 2002,"Reading other reviewers comments suddenly made me realize why this film made me so angry. Yes, it was the fact that Laney Boggs (Rachel Leigh Cook) was treated like dirt by everyone. To be honest I didn't think Zack (Freddie Prinze Jr) deserved to get the girl. If he one iota of decency he would foregone the role of Prom King and kept Laney well away from his phony friends before it even reached Prom Night. But he selfishly didn't and showed he just wanted his moment of peer adulation from his spoilt friends. Why should comedy be had from picking on a girl who's mother had died when she was a child and didn't want to be part of the 'in' crowd. But obviously the writers believe that should be Laney's sole goal at school, was to be popular. It must have been only Rachel Leigh Cook's acting performance that kept me watching until the end of the film. To be honest she reminds a lot of a young Mary Stuart Masterson who played rather too many of these characters until she became type cast.

The commercials and promos made it look really cute.  I was very disappointed by the characters. Freddie Prinze,Jr. is undeniably adorable, but his character is so spineless. Rachael Leigh Cook's character is so snotty that I couldn't feel the sympathy I know the director wanted me to (maybe it is because I remember her annoying guest appearance on Dawson's Creek.)  And, that scene with the pizza was disgusting.  The only characters with any life and spunk were the siblings of the two main characters--Kieran Culkin as Laney's brother and Anna Paquin as Zach's sister.  Unfortunately, they weren't enough to save this movie.  That is just my opinion, but I have no desire to see it again or recommend it.

And sure enough, you regret wasting the time and money afterwards.""She's All That"" starts promisingly enough, with a cool introduction of Uber-school president Prinze and some of the other characters(Matthew Lillard mostly), a neat beach flashback, and a subsequent performance art scene. Then the movie completely gets away.Film critic Roger Ebert applauds the humor ""around the edges"" of ""She's All That"". Though there were some funny, random scenes, many of the jokes in this movie went out to die.(""I've decided to supersize my [falafal] balls,"" says an old man at a Middle Eastern-fastfood restaurant.) Really inexcusable were lines, meant to shed depth on the titular characters, but came out of absolutely nowhere and just confused me. For example, a confrontation between Zack(Prinze) and his father plays out horribly cliched, especially because Zack's complaints don't appear based in reality. Another artist mocks Laney(Cook) for no reason and refers to something that the viewer hasn't even witnessed in the movie. ""She's All That"" was set over a six week time span pre-Prom, but surprisingly little takes place, not enough to fill up more than a week by my reckoning.I don't know why this movie has been treated so favorably on IMDB. At this point, ""She's all that"" is rated in the mid-6s--above, ""Top Gun"", ""Spaceballs"", ""White Men Can't Jump"", and ""Risky Business"". Heck, the far better ""Can't Hardly Wait"" was cut from the same cookie cutter mold and targeted at the same group, and most like this movie more. My only guess is that viewers like the young, talented cast. Cook was beautiful and Prinze and the rest of the cast were cute, though they didn't work great together. This is the exact kind of shlock that gets packaged together and trotted out to high school kids every graduation. Thumbs down from me.",She's All That

It is really great to know that the actor in the film is having a good time filming, and you can see the look of joy in his eyes as he speaks...I really think he will be a huge star someday!!!! And now things that were bothersome about the film:  First of all, Rachel Leigh Cook was nowhere near dorky enough to be such an outcast, and then after he dresses her up and all, she really isn't All That!!!  Her brother, played by Kiernan Culkin delivered some pretty funny dialogue at times, and he is obviously the better actor!!  Matthew Lillard's part wasn't huge, but he was onscreen long enough to be annoying, so discount his role right there!!  Kevin Pollack did a great job also, as I was in stitches throughout every scene he was in.

There's little resemblance except the plot, but seen as a film, it is both funny, and heck of a lot more romantic that the anti-romantic play that Bernard Shaw wrote. My favourite thing about this film is the quirky characters. The leads are charming enough, but the siblings of the two lead characters, played by Kieran Culkin and Anna Paquin, is used to much better and funnier effect. Kieran Culkin seems to have much more acting ability than his more successful bro. He impressed me a lot in 'the Mighty'. And Paquin is surprisingly cute and funny, which is something I would have expected from her dramatic turn in 'the Piano'. As an adaptation, it's unsurprisingly cruddy.

My other comment on the movie is, although people are correct in that aside from the glasses Laney didn't really look like a geek, I think most people can agree that the people who are negatively singled out at school aren't necessarily the ""geeky"" looking ones.  Laney reminds me a lot of a friend of mine I had growing up.  She wasn't ugly, but couldn't relate well to other kids.  She eventually changed enough to where she was liked by others, but her overall personality and interests never changed --- which was sort of the same with Laney; even though she took off the glasses and started wearing make-up, she still basically wore the same clothing and had the same personality and interests.Overall, it wasn't TOO bad of a movie.",She's All That

Like any other predictable teen 90s movie, Zack starts to fall for the out of the ordinary, quirky Laney as he gets to know her. With her help he is also able to deal with his life problems and everything is happily ever after. Many of the films targeted towards teens during this time, during anytime really, all have really similar plots. It's not like this film is a break-through or has a message so incredibly deep that the world would be lost without its insight, but as far as these movies go it isn't the worst ever.

Some jokes even of the screw-ball comedy type that seems grossly out of place and simply fall flat.  Freddie Prinze Jr. is completely unlikable in his 'Brandon Walsh wannabe' role.  The writer who thought it was a good idea to have him make two bullies eat pubic hair has never spent a minute in a high school.  It's empathetically akin to Nancy Regan's Just Say No campaign.  It only appeals to adults who have forgotten what it was like to be a teenager.  Pure tripe.Kevin Pollak seems completely out of place in this film.  And that's a good thing.  He is once again at the top of his game in this film.  He injects the only genuine emotion into the picture with his role as the cliché sensitive dad.  I found myself wishing the script would follow him and his struggles as a single dad with Ally Sheedy from Breakfast Club and Forrest Gump as children.  I just couldn't get myself to care about anyone else.There are so many better attempts at the teen comedy genre than this effort.

Zack confidently makes a bet with his best friend (Paul Walker) thinking that any girl he dates can become the next prom queen. After a bit of searching they find an unpopular art student named Laney (Rachael Leigh Cook) who seems like the perfect person for Zack's friend to win the bet and humiliate Zack at the same time. After this, Zack reluctantly rejects his friends bet and tries to back out, but his friend is resilient and refuses to change his mind. Accepting this, Zack approaches and attempts to befriend Laney in the hope of transforming her into prom queen material. Zack eventually manages to spend some time with Laney and ultimately realises that he loves Laney and that they have a lot in common. Ultimately Zack sees Laney as his true love and he doesn't care if he loses the bet because he has found something so much better in return.This is an enjoyable teen romantic comedy.

Zach Siler(Freddie Prinze Jr.) makes a bet that he can turn and unpopular girl Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) into prom queen after being dumped by his girlfriend Taylor Vaughan (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe). The movie has some aspects of a Rom com with the odd witty comments. Freddie Prinze Jr and Rachael Leigh Cook play the characters amazingly they give you a great impression of the character and how they react in certain situations.

134,rmlattimore,worth watching for Rachel Leigh Cook,8,4 April 2009,"There are some movies that make me just stop what I'm doing and watch. Braveheart, Clear and Present Danger, Casino Royale, Godfather I and II, Goodfellas, Top Gun are just a few that come to mind. Not all are classics, but all have _something_ to them that engrosses me. She's All That is one of those movies.Yes, Rachel Leigh Cook is so so cute. Fuggedaboudat. Watch her. See if she delivers one line as if she memorized it, as if she's repeating what someone else wrote. There's not one unnatural act or utterance from her. She is completely believable, and because her character rings so true, you cannot help but empathize with her, and that is what makes the movie -- when she wins out in the end, you're happy she did because she makes you care about her. She's as good as Kate Blanchett was in The Aviator (completely different movies, completely different roles, by Blanchett deservedly won an Oscar). She has that character absolutely nailed, you won't see - can't see -- a better performance.(And for what it is worth, this may be Paul Walker's best performance. I credit the director for getting the performances that he did out of cast of young actors not generally known for their talent.) As for the rest of the movie, you've seen it before, but so what? Star Wars is Battle of Britain, set in the future with a backstory, no one holds that against it. The choreographed dance scene is great, and it IS well cast and it IS well acted, clichéd or not.",She's All That

Freddie Prinze, Jr. plays the typical popular guy. (i guess that's because he plays soccer, that makes him popular, just like real high school, right?) Anyway, his bleached-brain friends start a bet to turn an ugly duckling into a prom queen. Unfortunately, they already picked a beautiful swan.  In fact, the movie points out that Cooke's only ""ugly"" attribute is that she wears glasses. And, naturally, we assume that glasses make her nerdy and ugly.  It would have been much more interesting if they picked an overweight girl with braces, and started an alternate day bulk-up routine and a diet of Slim-Fast, to make her skinny enough for prom-queen acceptable.  Instead, the filmmakers make it easy on themselves by simply getting the girl contacts.  The rest of the movie tries to make us believe that this is how high school students behave and act, and becomes offensive.  I hated watching the scenes of the big parties, the walking on the beach, and the unsightly hair on the pizza.  Don't any of these students take time to study and learn?  Oh, no.  Of course not.  That's what all the nerdy people do, and we're trying to make them prom queen.  And prom queens do not like books (according to the movie)  Anyway, I am sorry to say that I saw this movie, luckily I saw it at the dollar theater.  I'm hoping that Hollywood will come out with a satrical, unique high-school comedy in the future.  I continue to wait...",She's All That

It's not as good a film, in my opinion, but it does have a certain charm and works your emotions a bit.I have to agree with the critics that Rachael Leigh Cook is far too pretty at the beginning of the film, so the whole premise that it would be impossible to ""tidy her up"" is a bit thin. This plot element is still being used - see ""The Princess Diaries"" for the best version (IMHO) - and was probably originally taken from the Cinderella story.Of course, a deeper meaning of the film is about making choices and coming of age, but this is not very clearly shown as it gets in the way of the main theme of the film - being proud of who you are.",She's All That

He is also a shoe in for Prom King. When the fabulous Mr Siler gets dumped dramatically by campus cow and Prom-Queen-to-be, Taylor Vaughn, Zac and best mate Dean make a bet that he can turn any girl as nominated by Dean into the prom queen. Enter Lanie Boggs, artist-in-waiting and school weirdo. Zac pursues Lanie on the bet but along the way, he... never mind!

The cast was a who's-who of Hollywood's teens, they were all great looking, some pretty good acting, slighty predictable, but those are my favorite kinds! :)Great, if you're a teen.

143,Phantom Phan,"""Pygmalion"" for 1990s High Schoolers",8,16 February 1999,"""She's All That"" is an update/remake of old classics like ""My Fair Lady"" and Pygmalion.  In the movie, Zack (Freddie Prinze Jr.),  is the school jock, his gorgeous (albeit catty) girlfriend, is Taylor (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe).His buddy is Dean (Paul Walker) and Laney Boggs (Rachel Leigh Cook), is a nerdy, dour art student.The plot is fairly predictable.  What keeps the movie going is fairly decent acting, and very strong supporting roles.  Kevin Pollack is outstanding as Laney's father, and Paul Walker and Jodi Lyn O'Keefe are excellent as the vile antagonists. (O'Keefe especially so as the witchy, self-centered Taylor Vaughn)One last note: This movie is VERY geared towards people who went to high school during the 1990s.  I'm not saying you won't like it if you're older, but you probably won't enjoy it as much as the 16-24 year olds who do see it.Verdict: Very watchable, easy on the brain, easy to enjoy.",She's All That
144,mjblake,oh to be popular......,7,8 June 1999,"That this film is viewed by most reviewers here as better than average for its genre is due almost entirely to a marvellous performance by Rachael Leigh Cook in the lead role. As mindless entertainment, this just about passes, but to be honest, it doesn't have much else going for it.  One perhaps should not expect too much of this type of film, but at a time when teen culture in the USA is very much under the microscope, this says very little about life as a teenager at the end of the century, refusing to challenge the audience and pandering to every cliched assumption in the book.  Is it really true that everyone deep down wants to be prom queen popular, for instance, or that a geeky but beautiful art student who grew up without a mother really just needs another female's attention to show her how to wear make-up or pluck her eyebrows?..... (like wearing make-up and plucking eyebrows are incontrovertibly ""good"" things).The plot is so familiar as to be barely worthy of a mention, while the 2-dimensional supporting characters might also ring a few bells (nasty best friend, bitchy ex-girlfriend prom-queen, father (i) supportive but clueless - until the final reel, father (ii) overly ambitious for child, dorky (sex-less) friend, little brother in need of our hero's protection..... ). Throw in some clumsy editing, a couple of excruciating scenes - in particular, the ""dad, you can't live your life through me - son, i never wanted you to think that"" exchange, and a typically awful and unrealistic soccer scene (from ""Karate Kid"" to this, why do they bother?) and we could have witnessed a real disaster.However, Ms Cook makes one of the more attractive teen heroines, in a very Winona-esque way, and continually holds our interest, as does the dialogue, which when it's not being borrowed from a third grade soap opera is snappy and fresh (though never quite up to ""Clueless"" standards).  The plot does knowingly sidestep a number of cliches, for which we should be grateful, and the use of dream sequences, seamless flashbacks, and a tv show within the film, all offer variety to keep the viewer interested.Finally, though, I was left with one big regret - he didn't deserve her, and it was a real pity that she (ie, the writers) didn't recognise that fact.PS -  One footnote - did anyone else while watching the scene where the two guys wearing combat gear and ""Kill Artists"" t-shirts are humiliated by head jock and class president Zac start to wonder that maybe it's events like this that lead to such people turning up at school the next day with guns and hand grenades.....?",She's All That
145,Def_Jam,Fantastic act. Rachael Leigh Cook & Freddie Prinze are great!,10,31 August 1999,I think it was a good movie.

Bunch of Simpletons they are.I saw this movie on a Valentine's Day, and it was really good. While I agree that it was predictable, it was interesting just to see where things were going anyways.The bright spot of this movie was the lead, Rachael Leigh Cook. A Minnesotan with a lot of spunk, she brings the Class Geek part to life, and does very well.As far as Matt Lilliard, Paul Walker, etc...mediocre. Freddie Prinze Jr. wasn't too shabby, though.The main big thing about the movie is that there was a lesson learned. If you saw ""My Fair Lady"", you'd have learned a bit in the area of respect.

147,rec26,Pretty Bad,3,2 June 2003,"Formulaic Recipe gone bad!This movie has all of the elements of an average teen high school flick. The popular group, the unpopular group, the 'controversial' mixing of the popular group and the unpopular group. Yet somehow this movie is definitely below average. The bright spot of the movie is Kevin Pollak who plays La-Ney's practical, dim-witted father. Also the cheesy art spectacle near the beginning is ok and La-Ney's friend (?) Elden Henson gives the audience a fresh comic break from what is an otherwise predictable and unfulfilling plot.The main problem with the movie is not that it is filled with cliches. Rather that some of the cliches just do NOT make any sense within the scope of the movie. A good example is the subplot of the conflict between Zach Siler and his father. It just is something extra that adds nothing to the main plotline of the movie. Then in the end when Zach graduates he is naked. What does any of this have to do with the movie? He already got the girl so what does it matter if we even see him graduating or not? In this movie it was entirely unnecessary. The movie should have just ended with Zack and La-ney kissing or something like that.I don't know it just seemed to me as though this movie started out ok and then went on a downward spiral.",She's All That

But what I saw was a very original and good film that took a very unoriginal plot and turned it into two hours of pure fun and originality. They took My Fair Lady and countless other films that go by the same storyline, and add in creative dance sequences, a cafeteria scene involving Pubic hair and a slice of pizza, and a cool Sarah Michelle Gellar Cameo. Rachel Leigh Cook is a very good actress, as is Jody Lyn O Keefe. Mathew Lillard and Freddie Prinze Jr are awesome as the two male leads, and Paul Walker sure is getting a lot of good exsposure lately in this movie and Varsity Blues.

I personally like the so-called ""teen"" movie gendre and was not disappointed with this film. Freddie Prinze Jnr. is perfectly cast as the ""most popular boy in high school"" - he has the looks and the charm and is able to make the audience sympathise with his character. Rachael Leigh Cook makes a worthy debut in a feature film but i was distracted by her uncanny resemblence to one of my fav. actresses Winona Ryder! I thought Jodi Lyn o'Keefe was brilliant as the ""Miss Popular"" of the school - she is a genius of comedy! More attention could have been given to Matthew Lillard and Kevin Pollack whose limited camera-time was very entertaining.The style of the film was very colourful and direction was well choreographed - the movement into the flashback sequence was particularly good. The comedy of the movie was OK but i did feel that a lot of the lines delivered were restrained. However, i loved the dance sequences which were unique and very enjoyable to watch.All in all, this is a good movie. The teen cast (esp. Freddie Prinze Jnr.!) were the highlight and the overall feel of the film was enjoyable and entertaining.",She's All That

153,william-aaron-kelly,Truly A Classic,10,6 November 2017,"Zack, that classic, perfect and handsome jock that has it all. He's got money, he's got the ladies. But there is more that meets the eye.Zack's narcissistic witch of a girlfriend, Taylor, breaks up with him after a romantic rendezvous with a gross reality star on the Real World season 2 LA, Brock.This becomes the hottest gossip throughout this Southern California high school when Usher announces it to the whole school. That is when Zack decides that he will absolutely NOT feel any self pity and will turn this whole debacle around. Zack's manipulative best friend, Dean, calls him out on his bluff but decides that he wants to play a game. He challenges him to a bet that he can't turn just any run-of-the-mill gal into a prom queen to beat Taylor. Their other seemingly nice black best friend, Preston, thinks they're being crazy and wants NOTHING to do with this.They're being little typical judgmental pricks when Dean spots Laney, a confused socially awkward art student and just an all around klutz. Zack then screams ""LANEY BOGGS? NO WAY."" Then he reluctantly decides to accept the bet.He first attempts to approach her at school, fails. Zack then goes to Laney's work at a local taqueria. She says, ""HELLO?!?!? STALKING IS ILLEGAL!?!?!"" However, she decides to give him five minutes to explain himself. She decides to let him come to an art piece. Now, this is where my fave part of the movie comes in. It's so funny. omgThey go to this art show where this dude is running around in undies in this interpretive art piece then Laney comes out and steals it away. This is where Zack really starts to almost immediately fall in love with her. Laney throws him on the stage, however, he totally pulls this hackeysack out of nowhere and starts kicking it to some kind of poem about how pressured he feels in life and totally pulls it off. They go outside and Zack tells her that she has beautiful eyes. She says ""WHAT THE FREAK? I KNEW IT. YOU TOLD ME I HAVE BEAUTIFUL EYES!"" And then runs away.Zack shows up uninvited to her house and becomes tight with her dad and brother. Laney's like ""WTF YOU JUST DON'T GIVE UP DO YA?"" They go to the beach.Gabrielle Union really takes notice of Laney and how much more she likes her than evil witch Taylor and nominates her for prom queen.Queue classic scene where Zack asks his pretty sister Mackenzie to give Laney this hot top-of- the-line look for Preston's party. She takes the glasses off and slaps on a red dress and whoa, we got a whole new woman.They go to this party and Laney gets revenge on her arch-nemesis in art, Misty, by painting her face to resemble a clown after just trying to help her. Taylor sees her at the party and makes a scene by pouring wine down her dress. Everyone gets quiet and Laney just books it, crying. That is when Zack stops to look at Taylor and says ""WHAT THE HECK IS YOUR PROBLEM?!?!"" And continues to run out, leaving Taylor standing there looking flabbergasted.Everyone is LOVING that Laney is running and giving a voice to the rejects of the school. Taylor comes back after a short disappearance, upset that her reality star boyfriend broke up with her, but has her brain focused on prom queen. She steps out of her car after crying and is immediately over it when she sees she has competition from Laney. She looks at Gabrielle Union and their white gal pal and exclaims ""DID I MISS SOMETHING!?""Everything is going fine for Zack and Laney until that evil, manipulative Dean, has had enough. He sneaks up on Laney behind Zack's back at the taqueria she works at and asks her to prom and throws Zack under the bus. When they're decorating for prom, Taylor tries to scheme on Zack and he's like uh no, I love Laney and Taylor informs him that Laney is going to prom with Dean.Zack turns around with them big sad blue eyes and sprints up to Laney and Dean and says ""WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? WHAT THE HELL DEAN? THIS ISN'T FAIR!"" Scandal unfolds. Dean is like ""dude, I can't do this bet anymore, I love her."" Zack is like ""WTF IS YOUR PROBLEM DEAN?!?!"" This is where my favorite line is exclaimed. ""Zack, is this true? AM I A FRICKIN BET?""Zack and Laney are both moping around, because they're in love, but he looks like a jerk and she looks like a fool. Laney and her dad have a real moment and convinces her to go have fun at prom and that there is a handsome guy waiting for her upstairs.You get prepared and think heck yeah, Zack is there. BUT NOPE it's Dean. Laney barely loses to Taylor. Dean, Preston and their pals are hanging out in the boy's room when Dean announces his plan to steal Laney's innocence. Preston is unimpressed with Dean at this point is like ""quit being a jerk, she's a cool girl."" Dean is like ""WTF IS YOUR PROBLEM?"" They all walk out and that's when Laney's dweeb best friend, who now dates Mackenzie??, comes out and stops Zack in the middle of his prom king speech to tell him Dean's plan. Zack darts out of the gym leaving Taylor by herself. Zack runs to Laney's house and surprises her when she walks in and says ""I had no idea"" and she was like ""he's a jerk"" and then they kiss.Thank you Freddie Prinze, Jr. Thank you Rachael Leigh Cook.

The only thing that slightly raised a smile was RLC's dad getting all the questions wrong in the background!The lead two actors aren't particularly bad, but the script is so wooden, it doesn't do them any favours and makes this film a poor-man's Clueless (says it all really!)And the really sad thing is that most, if not all, American highschools are as empty and shallow as this one.AVOID!!",She's All That

It's always engaging to see a well-made yet truly bad film, and this is one of them - some nice cinematography, a few funny moments, but overall a badly-scripted gag-worthy cliché fest.The script is clunky and not particularly believable, and the scenes feel like simple plot devices, as if the scriptwriter was ticking off a little chart: ""This will make him love her... this will make her love him... this will make her prettier... this will make her love him more... this will make her hate him and this will make her love him again..."" It also contains some fairly disturbing messages. Rachel Leigh Cook's character begins as an albeit introverted, but interesting character - arty and concerned about the state of the world. This is apparently wrong. What is right is that you're pretty and you have fun and you don't care about anything important. Freddie Prinze Jnr's character is a shallow selfish moron with no chivalrous aspects whatsoever. This is apparently good. He is the reformer, she is the reformee. Entirely the wrong way around!On the plus side, Matthew Lillard's character is a lot of fun, if only because he is paired with the extremely hateable Taylor. In fact, she's so hateable you can't work out why anyone would be friends with her in the first place, let alone want to vote her Prom Queen.There are a few cute moments, but most of it makes me want to gag.

I think the movie to me is kind of like My Fair Lady meets Saved By the Bell as your typical group of High School preppies converge to transform a not overly nerdish nerdette ( female nerd in my terms). Rachel Leigh Cook was charming in the lead as Laney the modern day Eliza Doolittle and Freddie Prinze Jr picks up the fine acting chores from where his late dad left off. Prinze Sr. would have been mighty proud. The film has a predictable but sweet ending which i definitely appreciated. Many critics put the film down. One critic said it was inferior to Can't Hardly Wait  and called Can't a good film.She's... is not inferior to Can't though. Can't Hardly Wait was good , but She's All That was superb.

Let me amend that-she started out HORRIBLE, but by the end of the movie was at least WATCHABLE. Freddie Prinze Jr is very good looking and did a decent job. Kind of depressing subject matter-it is a shame if it is representative of how people are treated in high school these days when they are considered ""uncool"". I mean, I have not been out of school THAT long, but people were never that mean, at least directly to your face. Bottom line, not a movie I will watch again-but not so horrible that I wanted to sue for my admission to be returned. DEFINITELY not an adult outing movie!",She's All That

170,Jalen,Girl goes from geek to goddess...with a little help.,7,2 February 1999,"""She's all that"" is an exceptional movie. I know that it draws comparisons to ""Pretty in Pink"", ""Can't buy me love"" and others, but this should be listed among those classics. Rachael Leigh Cook, who plays Lainie Boggs, does an exceptional role. She's drawn comparisons to Winona Ryder, Audrey Hepburn, and Natalie Portman, if you ask me, that's good company. Freddie Prinze, Jr does a great job as the Mr. Popularity, but Lainie doesn't fall for him as quickly as most other girls would. Look for an outstanding (although relatively small) role by Anna Paquin, who plays Prinze's younger sister and make-up artist Mackenzie. Paquin, an academy award winner for ""The Piano"", is terrific in an unusual role for her. The star of the show, however, is Rachael Leigh Cook. My favorite scene isn't anything she says, but it's how she looks when she is walking down the hall with her friend Jessie (Elden Henson). I love the way she walks in this movie. I hope that stardom soon follows Cook. In the future, Academy Award nominations are sure to follow (like her comparisons to Hepburn and Ryder). If I had to characterize Rachael Leigh Cook in one sentence, it would be: She's all that.",She's All That

Anna Paquin is horribly miscast as Freddie's younger sister who gives Rachel a makeover to end all makeovers.The politics of this film are so 1940s that Rachel becomes ""hot"" by letting her hair down and taking off her glasses.

Set in a California High School in 1999, the film begins by the dumping of Big Man on Campus Zach by his former girlfriend, Taylor. It's a foregone conclusion that Zach will be Prom King and most assume that Taylor will be Prom Queen. However, revenge prompts a bet that Zach can take any girl on campus and make her Prom Queen.The choice settles on art geek Laney Boggs. With only six weeks until the Prom can she be remade into the beautiful princess and win election as Prom Queen? This is where the film begins to break down. Rachel Leigh Cook is obviously pretty enough, even disguised as an art geek. And all that's necessary for her to be accepted by the in crowd is the friendship of Zach. Net time: 15 minutes. Laney may not like the in crowd, but that's ignored after a few brief scenes. Everything's predictable and simplistic.

I'm not totally convinced either one can act, but I'm open to seeing them in other movies. Kevin Pollack and Kieran Culkin are both very cute in their roles as the father and little brother respectively.Overall, this movie is a crummy collage of every high school teen movie cliche you can think of.

You should also see her when in the last scene in which she bursts into a laugh, when Zach accepts his graduation without his clothes, because he lost the bet.

Most of the characters were likable and fairly believable. Some of the supporting cast members tended to slide into the classic ""teenager in the '90's"" stereotypes, the movie occasionally pokes a little fun at itself in this respect with its stabs at such teenage entertainment institutions as MTV's The Real World.  Both Rachael Leigh Cook, who captures teenage awkwardness and unsureness with true mastery, and Freddie Prinze Jr. are likable in the lead roles and while this movie doesn't go breaking any new ground in particular, it seems to be good at what it does; present the audience with a modern day Cinderella story with a lot of heart.",She's All That

This reveiw is a two parter based on gender:(1)Girls will probably dig it, of course that's pretty sterotypical for me to say (it was apparent most girls liked it when i saw it, way too late for all the little girls who think they're mature so i can't say how they'll react). (2)For guys, unless you think Rachael Leigh Cook is the most beautiful girl in the world(like i do), i can say that by the reactions of my friends and most of the other guys, that none thought it was ""all that"". However we agreed it was better than Varsity Blues, since all that movie had for it was the ""sundae girl"", and Rachael Leigh Cook is in a whole different league. This review may seem shallow(seem? it is!), but i liked it mainly because of RLC(did i mention she's hot?). It's definitely the type of movie you'll either love, like, or hate.

209,cupcaketraitor,It's good when you're in the right mood,7,23 May 2019,"If you're up to watching something very complex and long, this movie is a great pick because it's lighthearted and the plot is simple and easy to follow. In terms of the characters, Laney is decently likeable and her personal background has some substance and conflict pertaining to the death of her mom. Zach, Laney's love interest, is a bit harder to instantly take a liking to, especially concerning the reason he and Laney even began to hang out. The friends and the family members of the characters don't really serve any purpose outside of comedic relief or cliche character tropes, except Dean. Dean is Zach's best friend and the one encouraged him to pursue Laney, he turns into the second love interest later in the movie and creates conflict for that section.None of the problems in this movie are developed largely and instead of being brought into prospect, they're left to linger at the back of your mind while you watch the two leads sweetly fall in love with each other. And then, when they are brought to the forefront again, you suddenly realize that there is some type of conflict between the characters. But it's also one of the movie's strong points because it establishes the movie's purpose and target audience. As I mentioned earlier, this movie is great if you are into bittersweet, entertaining films and don't need or want much drama added to the plot. The ending of this movie follows that theme, but falls flat in its intentions. After all of the pining between Zach and Laney and the sudden incident with Dean, it felt like the movie should have had a more satisfying end. The last scenes felt kind of rushed compared to the drawn out conflicts before them. It felt like Laney had forgiven Zach too easily and like Zach hadn't done anything to have her receive his ""apology.""This movie is perfect for background noise or when you're in the mood to laugh and smile more than anything else, because it's really simple and heartwarming. It's a nice film that will make you feel fuzzy and nice on the inside because it's so funny and cute. Nothing more, nothing less.",She's All That
210,edm-8,Real masterpiece,10,30 April 2001,"This movie has many features of high art. Indeed it is a specimen of such. Robert Iscove, director, knows how to make a great synthesis of feelings and conceptions.  The most difficult problem for an artist in wide sense of a term is to represent not only characters and events, but also ideas, make them visible.  Iscove certainly knows the way. In `She is all that' at first we see a story of a boy (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and a girl (Rachael Leigh Cook), watch the development of their characters towards each other.  The story is both realistic and  funny, social and ironical. Then we notice the conceptual background. Iscove plays with the oppositions `real  illusory', `art  life'.  His opinion seems to be that from the one point of view art is the imperfect imitation of life and as such has some illusory, unreal aspects. But from the other point of view life itself can be understood as a form of art. The life of such a kind is represented by the art of performance. Life as performance is a creative life, when we like the fact that we have not answers to all our questions. If we think that everything is clear to us then we live an ideal life, not for real, without feelings (as they, as Robert Iscove seems to  believe, are more real than all-explaining conceptions of our reason and understanding) and love.  All these well-known and, by the way, quite plausible ideas are brilliantly implemented in the body of the movie. We see a lot of examples of `mimetic' art  such as excerpts from an idiotic film `Real world' (of course it is not real film) and so on. We are presented with many photos and drawings and we see how they interact with real people and sometimes literally pass over to them and vice versa. Me also see finest connections between scenes, when, for example, a photo of a trees at the end of a scene changes with the real trees of the same species at the beginning of the next scene. This movie is overwhelmed with the interesting details and at the same time has strong and perfect composition.  As for latter, so not to say too much I just want to mention, that the `ideal  boy' Zach Siler (Freddie Prinze Jr.)  turns into real man when he incidentally happens to be in need to make performance in theatre. This is a culmination of the movie.  And this theme pass over to the final scene of the movie. It should be noted that final scenes in Robert Iscove's films  I mean also his outstanding  movie `Boys and Girls' (2000)  are simply amazing. He manages to focus in them all the conceptual and plot threads of his films. For instance, in `Boys and Girls' `boy' (again Fr. Prinze Jr. ) and `girl' (Claire Forlani) in a final scene simply fly away from abstractions, which held them as `seat-belts' during all the story.  Here, in `She is all that' the final scene is an ironical act of performance and real expression of love, as well as the summary of the main characters. I should only add that `She is all that' gives us not only much mental food for thinking over  which, as Immanuel Kant had proved already 200 years ago, is the the criterion of masterpiece  but also provides a great performance (indeed it would be strange if it does not). Rachael Leigh Cook and Freddie Prinze Jr. do their best, they act very realistic, creative and fresh, as well as others.

Also the movie needs more music, because sometimes it is really quite and silence and need something that makes you want to keep watchig it. There is also some moments or jokes really awkwards, but you have fun in some parts of the movie.Conclusion: if you just wanna hang out and put the movie like for the background it is ok. But if you are gonna to be concetrate in the movie, in my opinion i think that you can find a better romantic comedy ,like mean girls, 10 thing i hate about you, clueless, among others.",She's All That

219,joemystery2003,This one misfires and I think it knows it.,5,2 May 2005,"Some movies are so bad that they're good. They somehow circle back and their badness garners the film a cult following. Think ""Showgirls."" However, ""She's all That"" is the worst kind of bad film in that it's bad in an utterly forgettable way. The plot is hackneyed and trite, the acting is mediocre and much of the dialogue exists simply for the purpose of pushing plot.Here's what I think happened. A producer proposed a concept for a movie to a writer who was only doing this to further their career until they could write the movie they really wanted to (I'm hoping.) You have Zack, the Adonis-like jock, played with haunting banality by Freddie Prinze Jr, who is dumped by Taylor, his sexpot girlfriend (Jodi Lynn O'Keefe, one of the better performances in the film.) He then bets his friends that he can turn Lany, the school's dorkiest girl, played by Rachel Leigh Cook who does the best she can, into the prom queen. This film writes itself, right? Wrong! You still need a well-envisioned script to bring a movie to life. This writer clearly slapped this movie together the weekend before he met with the producers.To say this movie isn't thought-provoking or that it doesn't raise questions is a lie. I have several questions. One: why does Zach's sister Mackenzie (played by academy award winner Anna Paquin) who's one of the few interesting characters in the film get such little screen time? Same for Elden Henson and Kieran Culkin. Two: Why does Rachel Leigh Cook catch a basketball that Freddie Prinze Jr. holds next to his naked crotch with such a smile? I'm sure there would be some kind of black market value on an item that touched Freddie Prinze Jr's junk, but am I the only one who finds that a bit nasty? And three: if Zach is as smart as the film says he is, wouldn't he surely be able to see how incredibly beautiful Lany was underneath her glasses and her ""freaky"" clothes? They do such a terrible job of making the lovely Rachel Leigh Cook look ugly. In fact, when Zach and his buddies are picking the girl for the prom queen experiment, they gaze upon several different possibilities (all uglier than Cook) until they settle for the stereotypical ""nerd"" which is really just a supermodel in floods and glasses. I just keep thinking how much more interesting the film would have been if they would have picked an actress who didn't fit the mold of what is traditionally considered beautiful or smoking hot. Perhaps Maggie Gyllenhaal (that's just a suggestion and not one I necessarily recommend for any number of reasons. One: I happen to think she's gorgeous. And two: she wouldn't touch a film as dumb and meandering as this with a fifty-foot pole.)",She's All That

Plaid is kinda sexy on her.And of all the people to be the lead hard on, Freddie Prinze Jr.?Pa-leezzze.so I sat through a 2 hour lecture on how ""Were all pretty on the inside"" when in fact the characters were in no way ugly. the only ugliness was Freddie Prinze Jr.'s acting.I've got a pet monkey that could play a better lead man.I feel like I wasted 2 hours of my life.Thank God I didn't pay money to rent it.from now on I will trust my gut on picking a movie.Id rather watch Jesus Get beaten over watching Freddie Prinze Jr. beat his dads name into the ground.No wonder his dad shot himself.I gave it a 5 for the Rachel Leigh Cook stairway scene.

221,pathawk,Cute for a teen flick,7,1 February 1999,"To begin with, I'm a sucker for the eighties teen-targeted ""classics"" like the Breakfast Club and Pretty In Pink.  Sure, they're not the best films ever made, but they are good for what they are.  They reach their target audience, but still appeal to people of all ages.  In the nineties there have been far fewer of these films.  The only one I absolutely loved was Say Anything with John Cusack, but Clueless and Can't Hardly Wait were enjoyable.  This falls into the category of the latter two.  It's got attractive young stars, a good soundtrack, a few good laughs, that kind of thing.  The performances by Rachel Leigh Cook and Freddie Prinze were both great, and many of the supporting players were very good as well.  The storyline seemed shallow, but the development of the two characters' relationship was very cute.  A few slightly cheesy messages were sent out to the target audience, although most of the viewers were probably swooning over Prinze rather than receiving it.  It's still a nice story which proved the main character not to be shallow in the end, with, like I said, some good tunes, an easy on the eyes cast and a lot of funny lines.  There's one pretty memorable scene that takes place in the school cafeteria...pretty gross stuff but amusing nevertheless.  Overall I really enjoyed it, more than Varsity Blues or Can't Hardly Wait, some of the other recent teen films that come to mind.",She's All That

It reminded me that however you look on the outside isn't as important as who you are on the inside.

The plot is completely unoriginal, the jokes only mediocre and predictable, the characters two-dimensional at most, and the badly-portrayed stereotypes incredibly mind-numbing.

230,kcoates,A pleasant surprise,8,8 February 1999,"Although this film has few unpredictable plot changes, I found it to have many refreshing (and saving) aspects that are generally not found in these ""teen"" movies.  My favorite surprise was the main character, Laney, who does not fall into the usual Molly Ringwald trap (if you're looking for an '80s comparison - Pretty in Pink is probably the closest, character-wise) of girl falling head-over-heels for the jock and basically doing everything within her power to get him.  Instead, it's Mr. Popular chasing the girl, but only until he realizes that this goes much farther than a simple bet, that he actually has feelings for her.  Laney is not the kind of girl that is easily impressed by money or good-looks, she has been an outsider too long.  She is also able to rise above the popular class instead of simply wishing to be part of them.  The make-up of the ""populars"" also was nice, to have some of them actually seem human instead of all hairspray and fashion accessories. The one that befriends Laney does an especially good job at bringing depth to a group that is usually left to stereotypes.  (I would also like to add that she does this with few lines.)  However, most of the other characters do fall into some kind of established stereotype, so don't expect anything too drastic.    The thing that I liked the most about this movie was that it did not emphasize Laney's need to change.  Sure, she got a make-over and was brought out of her shell, but she was not really the one that needed changing.  She doesn't have to change for the guy to like her.  She stays true to herself, which is a much-needed aspect in this genre.",She's All That

It is a typical Cinderella story, but with a nice twist, nice enough to become one of my favorite movies.  Rachel Leigh Cook and Freddie Prinze Jr. were the leads, and the best in the movie.  Usher had a good part, small, but he played it well.  All in all, this movie is definitely worth 3 stars by me or any teenager stuck in high school.",She's All That

An example of bad acting is when the female protagonist ""cries"" and runs away. She supposedly falls down, but it was such a bad job, that even people were yelling, ""That was so fake!"" in the theater. Just think of this movie as Clueless, Can't Hardly Wait, and the Breakfast Club all mixed in one, minue any of the redeeming qualities these movies possess.

Because for me, at least, low expectations were the key to my enjoyment. The first half of the film is cleverly written and energetically filmed and acted. But then the second-act demon rears its ugly head and ""She's All That"" seems to lose its direction. Up to that point I had been able to defer a number of nagging annoyances about weak characterization and cliched plot devices. As the film lurched to its unsatisfying ending, I was left with sadness over what should have been a great movie. No kidding. If memory serves, it started as a high-concept pitch. Such flimsy blueprints tend to churn out utter tripe, so the filmmakers have to be commended, because ""She's All That"" definitely doesn't suck. Go in uncritically, or better yet, let someone drag you to it, and you will probably enjoy yourself.",She's All That

Besides being a great comedy/love story, it's also a reminder of what has happened during the past decade.  For example, the Real World became popular in the 90's, soccer became the ""other"" big sport in highschools across the nation, the ""valley girl"" was introduced and the leather-sleeved letter jacket made a come back.  In addition, a new type of language popped up, best summed up by Zack's line in the movie, ""There was wiggage.""However, besides being a movie that teens in the future will look to to gain a perspective of what the 90's were like, She's All That was a great film! I've seen it three times, and I plan to go again soon.  I was pleased with character development and the story as a whole.  In my opinion it is a must see.  The soundtrack is great, and the storyline is one that any ""romantic at heart"" will love.Don't get me wrong, this isn't your typical ""date"" movie where guy meets girl; it's a movie for a whole generation -- most of whom are in college now.

For instance, the weak attempt at creating a lower class family for the heroine is never even mentioned by the other characters. In fact the only time we realize that its important is when the father mentions ""Some people might say that being a pool man is not a respectable profession""And why the hell does the brother, Simon, have hearing aids?All I can say is that this film is Pretty In Pink with less teeth, and less talent.

I can`t describe how much I love this movie...  I know that it isn`t everyone`s cup of tea, but I`m quite into these slushy romantic teen comedy films.I won`t give you any details of the story, as you probably already know about it from reading other comments.Freddie Prinze Jr is PERFECT for his role, as is Anna Paquin for hers. Matthew Lillard plays his character very well, but may be a little overwhelming for some.  Clea DuVall, Jodi Lyn O`Keefe, Tim Matheson, Keiran Culkin and Kevin Pollack are all superbly suited to their roles...  which leads me to the female lead; Rachael Leigh Cook.I`m sorry, but the costume & make-up department really did mess-up with Rachael`s ""geek"" image.  Any male could quite easily see that she was a TOTAL MODEL, even with her messy clothes and glasses!  Having said that, Rachael plays the part faultlessly, and I defy anyone to deny that she didn`t remind us of ourselves at some point in our school days!If you like movies such as ""Some Kind of Wonderful"", ""Pretty in Pink"", ""Sixteen Candles"", and just about all other John Hughes moveis from the 1980`s then you`ll love this.

This line sums up what happens to her in the film.The enchanting scene when Laney gets a makeover and comes down the stairs is great, made even better when she trips downs the last couple of stairs and Zach catches her in his arms..Aahhhh rating 10 out of 10  (By the end of the film I wished that it had happened to me at school!)",She's All That

As teen romantic comedies go, there's other flicks that have been better - ""Clueless"" will, doubtless, go down in history as probably the best (so far) in it's genre. I'd say it was more a very well written story. Parts of the film made me sit on the edge of my seat thinking ""Why on earth did you say that?!?"" - most of the cases were of Freddie Prinze Jr's character Zach being a total fool and not saying or doing things that he probably should have. The audience groaned a couple of times when such events ocurred. The comedy aspect of the film was great, and to actually hear a bunch of very funny jokes being made from the 'jocks' was quite funny - since most other american teen flicks make them out to be fools with no brains whatsoever. Overall, She's All That was nothing special. It was funny in parts, ""groansome"" in others, and sweet for much of the remainder. But definately one I'd see again.",She's All That

254,aherneconroy42,Credible teen comedy,6,6 January 2000,"This is a worthy addition to the latest line of teen movies, its strongest features being the tight script and likeable characters.Freddie Prinze Jr's Zach is unusual as a ""jock"" character with whom it's possible to empathise. Moreover, even the ""geeks"" are fully fleshed characters, rather than obscure stereotypes.There are also at least two fine comedy setpieces, namely Zach's efforts at a performance art review, and Matthew Lillard's dance sequence.Naturally it's easy to see from the word go that Rachel Leigh Cook is a stunning girl who will easily stand comparison with the prom queen once she loses the glasses and gets a new outfit. However, this is not a film where you expect big plot surprises or clever turns. It's a well made, well written and well acted example of its genre, and well worth the price of a video rental.",She's All That
255,kwtweety99,"Cute, but not unique",8,24 January 2000,"She's All That is an amusing tale of good-looking guy falls for unusual girl.  Freddie Prinze Jr is perfect in his role as the hero and Paul Walker also fits well into the role of the conceited jock.  There are several humorous parts and I enjoyed watching Rachel Leigh Cook make the transformation from the ugly caterpillar into a graceful butterfly. Although I liked this movie, it was much of the same themes that always occur in teenage romance/comedies:  Popular vs. Geek, Pretty vs. Plain, Growing Up vs. Staying Young.  The ending is pretty predictable, but it is a good film for a night out with the girls.  This film will definitely be more appreciated by the younger crowd of viewers.",She's All That

We all went through it, and we can all relate to at least one of the characters. There is the gang of posh, snotty nosed bullies, the nerds, then all the people in between, and this film shows what happens when the two extremes come together and clash.  It depends on which group you fitted into at school as to whether you will like this film or not... If you were a nerd, or anyone in between, you'll love it, because it shows that the bullies don't always come out on top.",She's All That
259,sexylexi5,...yeh it was good,8,4 October 2006,"not a mind blowing summary, but yeah. I thought this film was good. It was like a nice transformation for the characters finding there way I thought, so yeah I liked it. And I saw it with my friends on a Saturday night, so thats what this film reminds me of, so yeah, its a good film to watch with your mates. I didn't see it when it first came out in the cinemas, my friend had it in the back, so we ended up all watching it, and like, got me near a crying point (im just that sort of person). So if you like a good hearted film with a lot of gags and all that, then you should watch it. Its got something for everyone. There are also a lot of good tunes along the way and all that. Plus, it'll have you talking about it! So you should all give this film a fairly good kudos! because it deserves it!! So if you haven't seen it, then get off this comment and rent it! And watch it with your friends, there's a part that you might not want to see it with your parentals or your grand parents, as like there's a sex bet if I remember right? I think so anyway, so your best off to go watch it with your mates!",She's All That

It wasn't my first choice to rent at blockbusters but my female house mates persuaded me we should all see it and i was very glad i did.All the cast were brilliant in the film i think and Rachael Leigh Cook was great ""eyecandy"". It's the first film where i thought Freddie Prinze Jnr fleshed his character out perfectly and as such has changed my preconceptions about him.More work for Ms Cook though please hollywood :)",She's All That

262,mallyland05,Music From the Movie,5,10 September 2007,"Does anyone remember the song, ""Kiss Me,"" that was playing while she was walking down the stairs? I don't remember who it was by--but it was on the radio ALL the time. Anyway, to get to my point--I always hated that song until a few weeks ago when I heard that New Found Glory had did a cover of it, and honestly, I can't stop listening to it. It is much more up-beat rock sound to it--and doesn't sound nearly as cheesy when sung by a guy! If anyone wants to listen to it, here's the link where you can: http://www.myspace.com/newfoundglory. There's also a video they done for it on there--it's pretty cool as well. Also, they are doing some covers from other popular movie songs, like the ending song from ""The Breakfast Club"" which pretty much everyone loves. However, as to the movie itself--it really is for teenagers. When I first saw it (I was 12!!), I was obsessed with it. I thought Freddie was a babe (ew!) and that story was realistic and ever-so-sweet. Recently, I watched it again with my sister...and, it was pretty tedious having to sit through with it. And Freddie is definitely not as cute as I once thought him to be. However, it will always hold a specially place in my memories, just for the fact that it's one of those cheesy, teeny-bopper movies.",She's All That

264,ms_pants_oh_yeah,This movie was terrible,1,31 December 2002,"for so many more reasons than I will ever care to mention here, but i will say this: nice story people! It is so unbelievable and typical and irritating. ""Pretty in pink,"" which really does not hold up over time, was far more successful at maintaining a female lead from a ""different"" background and perspective than the values typified by the standardized upper middle class white American patriarchal family, who was still able to maintain her integrity and own personality after becoming attracted to a popular rich guy... This movie only pretends it wants to explore the dynamic of ""opposites attract"" when it is really about assimilation, and values outside the mainstream being co-opted by it. And it was really, really embarrassing on top of that. Those kids in it were so cheesy and dumb, but no worse than the writers, whose fault this whole mistake really was... If there ever were any writers to begin with. It seems the development of the content of this film never went beyond the pitch phase: which is really too bad, because i think we all know that things are far more complicated for kids in high school than we ever see in mainstream films, and sometimes connections are formed that do not make sense, but are nonetheless worthwhile, and it is not always the girl conforming to the guy's idea of who she should be in reality! This film is so typical and sexist and lame! Do they always have to make the chick so empty headed, and the last to see what is really going on? Quelle disappointment!",She's All That

As a younger teenager, i used to dream of living in America so i could go to one of these schools. Shes All That,it would seem, is a typical example of an American high school. Secondary (high) schools over in England, are so boring! Whether your a geek, a snobby cheerleader, or something in between, you want to be grateful you didn't spend the most of your teenage years in the UK! I'm probably the equivalent to 'someone in the middle'. I wasn't considered a geek at school, neither one of those cheerleader types.

I saw ""Not Another Teen Movie"" before seeing this and didn't realize how closely it resembled this. I didn't go to my high school prom but I did attend the days of school leading up to it. I don't remember so much emphasis being put on King and Queen. No one had a posse following them around and each candidate wasn't endorsed by specific clubs. In fact, we didn't have stupid clubs that focused on hygiene and prisoners; we weren't that obscure.Anyway, Rachel Leigh Cook is beautiful and anyone could see that before Anna's character ""fixed her up"" and made her pretty. Glasses, overalls, and a pony tail don't exactly make a person undesirable. The only benefit to the existence of this movie is that a number of parodies can be made after it.One last thing, at the end he was indecent in public which calls for an arrest. He would go to jail or at least pay a fine for that. That was a dumb ending.",She's All That

It seems that every one I talk to about this finds it a little odd that myself, an 18-year old male, loved this movie because it carries the stereotype of being a ""chick flick"". I looked in the vote analysis and males almost liked this movie as much as females.And I guess the reason I really liked this movie was because I could connect to the character, Laney Boggs. I think Rachael Leigh Cook's character was stunning, just the way she was resilient to everything, to everything ""conformist"". Her personality was great and I guess it could be said that I ""fell in love with her"" (not literally, but you get the picture. :-P). My favorite part of the movie was when she and Zach were at the contemporary arts theater and after her skit with the two midgets she put Zach up on the stage and he did his hackey sack routine. That was great. But all-in-all I definitely give this movie a 10, hands down. :-)",She's All That

The main character of the story is another girl who doesn't stick to the ""norm"" and tends to be more of what society would consider as a rebel. Not in the drug using, sexaholic type, but the shy, quiet type. She keeps to herself and is instantly considered to be a loser.However, we can fix that by making her wear makeup, pretty dresses, and completely denying who she truly is. In the end, instead of being unique, she just becomes the same as everyone else. It can safely be assumed that the main character in this movie never receives much attention from men, except from her close friend who is constantly ushering her into the relationship with the guy who made a bet to turn her into prom queen.This movie brings out the lowest of lows in culture today by promoting outer instead of inner beauty.

Then after the public dismissal by radio host (Usher) he is out to save his reputation. He then takes a bet from his friend Paul (Dean Sampson) to turn the girl of Paul's choice into the prom queen in only six weeks. After a look around he decides on Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) a girl who does not care of what other people think this helps her and sometimes weakens her in her art. Zack then decides to meet up with her. She thinks its all a joke and does not listen to anything Zack says until his many futile attempts to learn about her and her interests! Soon the Beauty and the Geek fall in love with some help from Zack's sister Mackenzie (Anna Paquin), Laney's good friend (N/A)and Laney's Dad (Kieran Culkin).

Until he gives his heartbroken daughter one of the most sincere and heartfelt speeches I've heard from a movie like this. Every victory is earned through tight writing and character development without becoming unrealistic or given for the sake of a cheap win. This movie is definitely worthy of a closer viewing, the acting, writing and deeper meanings of the film are something that shouldn't be forgotten among the other shallow romcoms of the 90s and 2000s.",She's All That

The parts where I was supposed to get angry, I got angry. And the parts were I was supposed to yearn for love, I yearned.

That said, at times it's a bit cheesy and stereotypical but it helps convey the message that things are not always what they appear to be. I like watching movies ""for the heck of it"" and I found this to be a decent use of a little under two hours with a good combination of both sad and funny elements.You can do what I did: Watch this movie, and then watch Not Another Teen Movie right after it to see all of the similarities.
