0,Leofwine_draca,Surprisingly awful,4,30 October 2021,"Apparently a Sky Original movie based on an Andy McNab novel, this turns out to be a simplistic DIE HARD on a train copy with a real lack of money that becomes quickly apparent thanks to poor FX, cheesy CGI backgrounds throughout, and a particular dearth of talent when it comes to shooting the many action sequences. It's a far cry from UNDER SIEGE 2, a long-term favourite of mine; instead, we get a posh boy hero battling against Ruby Rose (unbelievable as a tough character once more) while the likes of Andy Serkis, Tom Hooper and others are criminally wasted in their roles. Squint and it might be just about passable in places, but it really should be a lot better than that. And some of the dialogue is truly hideous.",SAS - Red Notice
1,SnoopyStyle,mindless,4,16 March 2021,"William Lewis (Tom Wilkinson) and his two children, Grace (Ruby Rose) and Oliver (Owain Yeoman), are a cold-blooded family who run a private security company. They massacre locals in Georgia for a gas pipeline. When the killings go viral, the British government orders the family to be arrested in a Red Notice. SAS operator Tom Buckingham (Sam Heughan) leads the team. Unbeknownst to him, the British government had actually hired the Lewis family to secure the gas for Britain. After the operation, Tom is taking his girlfriend Dr. Sophie Hart (Hannah John-Kamen) on the train to Paris. The train is hijacked by the Lewis children and stopped in the middle of the Channel Tunnel.This has some action but it's the Brits trying to copy Hollywood's mindless action flicks. It's mindless fun in sections but the main problem is that it goes on too long. First, it's a mistake to kill off Tom Wilkinson who is the best villain in the movie. Second, it's a silly premise cooked up by a silly writer. It's next to impossible to escape from the Channel Tunnel. It's a poorly considered plan that makes little sense. Third, one would think it's hard to hide in the tunnel. There are only so many places. He's either on top of the train or underneath the train. Finally, this movie should end quite soon after the big explosions. It keeps going and going for far too long. Just wrap it up. Apparently, this movie is based on a book. Maybe the book is trying to be Tom Clancy. In reality, it's aiming for Steven Seagal in Under Siege 2 and failing.",SAS - Red Notice
2,Prismark10,SAS: Red Notice,3,10 April 2021,"SAS: Red Notice is a movie adapted from an Andy McNab book.William Lewis (Tom Wilkinson) and his two children, Grace (Ruby Rose) and Oliver (Owain Yeoman) were hired by the UK government to terrorize locals in Georgia.Just so the British government can buy the land for a gas pipeline. However the massacre was captured on a mobile phone.Military fixer Clements (Andy Serkis) has been sent to terminate the Lewis family but the children escape.Now Grace wants revenge on the British government and plans to attack a train going through the channel tunnel.It just so happens that SAS operative Tom Buckingham (Sam Heughan) who was involved in the raid on the Lewis household happens to be on the same train. He is taking his girlfriend to Paris.Effectively this is a low rent Die Hard on a Train. The action scenes are shoddy. The film is overlong and messy.The movie is a bit too silly and threatens to never end.Heughan is bland as the action hero. Ruby Rose makes an impression as the baddie who seems to just needlessly kill people. Understandable why the British government wanted to get rid of the troublesome family.",SAS - Red Notice

4,paul_haakonsen,Good old fashioned action thriller...,6,4 August 2021,"For an action thriller, then I will say that writer
Laurence Malkin actually managed to churn out something that felt like a good old fashioned action thriller. But of course, as the movie is based on an Andy McNab novel.The storyline told in ""SAS: Red Notice"", as directed by
Magnus Martens, actually was interesting and captivating from the very beginning and up to the end. So this movie was essentially without any dull moments for me.The acting in the movie was adequate for a movie such as this. And while I can't claim to be overly familiar with actor Sam Heughan, then he did carry ""SAS: Red Notice"" quite well.There is a good amount of action in the movie, nicely crammed into the storyline and it actually made for a good combination of action and storytelling. Sure, the storyline was predictable, but hey, aren't most action thrillers following the same formula anyway? And I will say that the action sequences in the movie had a very dynamic feel to it.I was genuinely entertained by ""SAS: Red Notice"", and it is a movie that actually is well-worth taking the time to sit down and watch. My rating of ""SAS: Red Notice"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",SAS - Red Notice
5,searchanddestroy-1,Under Siege 2 under the Channel,7,6 September 2021,"Or the reverse DOORMAN, another billionth DIE HARD rip-off, where the good character was a female. Here, the evil leader is a female, but also a character for whom we can find some kind of empathy, as were the villains of the novel from which DIE HARD was inspired from, terrorists who had good ""human and reasonable reasons"" to commit what they did. This is the only movie among the DIE HARD rip-offs where the bad guys are lead by a girl. That deserves to be noticed. That remains a lousy directing piece of work though. No, only the evil gal is worth the watch. And the behavior of the good guy's broad, at the beginning reluctant to the fact that her man kills people, and then suddenly asks - orders - him to kill, kill, especially the villain gal, fo whom the audience may feem some empathy.... Interesting indeed. Very interesting. Forget the rest.",SAS - Red Notice
6,zardoz-13,Psychopaths To The Rescue,8,4 May 2021,"Imagine being a hostage aboard a hijacked train waylaid beneath the English Channel in an undersea railway tunnel while terrorists and the authorities haggle about your fate. This spectacular situation spawns suspense galore in director Magnus Martens' ""SAS: Red Notice,"" a contemporary, white-knuckled thriller laden with intrigue, murder, and mayhem. Making matters worse, our red-blooded hero is riding on that train with his girlfriend when it is halted. He resigns himself to setting aside his marriage proposal plans until he can sort out the villains. As Tom Buckingham, Sam Heughan-known best as Jamie Fraser in the ""Outlander"" cable-TV series and Mila Kunis' co-star in ""The Spy Who Dumped Me""(2018)--delivers a performance which qualifies him to play the next James Bond. The tall, square-jawed, gimlet-eyed Scotsman is the spitting image of Roger Moore. FYI, Moore was the second official cinematic 007. Although loosely based on former Special Air Service veteran Andy McNab's bestseller, the outcome resembles ""Die Hard"" on a train. Heughan's quick-witted hero meets his match in a bitter terrorist as psychotic has he is. Grace Lewis (Ruby Rose of ""Vanquish"") threatens to give the Prime Minister more than he bargained for since he ordered her father's demise. William Lewis (Tom Wilkinson of ""The Patriot"") had been doing the dirty work for the British since they cannot afford the scandals. William weaned Grace on weapons, and she grew up with an itchy trigger finger. Between Heughan's gallantry and Rose's villainy stands Andy Serkis. As the military advisor to the Prime Minister and Lewis, George Clements (Andy Serkis of ""Black Panther"") takes your mind off everybody else with his spontaneous scene-stealing shenanigans.""SAS: Red Notice"" takes place in the Republic of Georgia. The Black Sea laps the Republic's western shores; Russia sprawls to the north, Armenia and Turkey to the south, and Azerbaijan to the east. William Lewis runs his own private paramilitary outfit called the Black Swans. They go where the British cannot fly the Union Jack. A high-profile British company is constructing a gas pipeline through Georgia, and the Black Swans are troubleshooters who resolve stoppages. As the movie opens, George Clements authorizes him to bribe the stubborn villagers who refuse to make way for the pipeline. William's son Oliver (Owain Yeoman of ""American Sniper"") hasn't lived up to his promise. Instead, Oliver struts around too much with a cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth trying to look tough. William plans to turn command of the Black Swan over to his sadistic daughter Grace who is singularly without a trace of that emotion. As they approach the disputed section of pipeline, William lectures Grace about psychopaths.""Less than one percent of the population is psychopathic. Psychopaths often inherit the trait and are incapable of love. They manage their relationships with clinical precision, succeeding in all walks of life. Psychopaths that can learn to love are even more rare."" Basically, William has described Tom Buckingham to a tee without realizing it. Further, Tom will achieve everything which William attributes to psychopaths. As it turns out, this combat-tested, stealth-oriented, SAS counterterrorist has been dating his polar opposite. Dr Sophie Hart (Hannah John-Kamen of ""Tomb Raider"") questions her own sanity because she knows their relationship will never evolve. She doesn't like what Tom does and she never fails to admonish about this lifestyle. Nevertheless, Tom resolves to slip a ring on the fourth finger of Sophie's left hand.Meantime, Grace leads a squad of heavily armed men and women under a conspicuous white flag. No sooner has she entered the village than she spots snipers. A firefight ensues. Grace feels a bullet nibble at her neck, while some of her troops become casualties. William races to his daughter's side. He looks at her in the eye. She explains the villagers didn't want money. ""They wanted a fight,"" William nods grimly, then prompts her to action. ""Make a decision."" While machine guns chatter around them, Grace looks into her dad's eyes. She recites The Black Swan's credo, ""Kill the men and the boys and leave the women to spread the fear."" The Black Swans wipe out the male population. They drive the women and children from the village, and then reduce it to ashes with their flamethrowers. Neither Grace nor her father had counted on a lone villager equipped with a cell phone who records a video of their atrocity. Naturally, the video goes viral, with William, Grace, and Oliver caught on camera red-handed slaughtering villagers without mercy.Tom has bought airline tickets to Paris for Sophie and himself. He cruises on his motorcycle to St. Thomas' Hospital in London where he surprises her during her Pediatric ward rounds. Sophie looks forward to the prospect of a Parisian holiday, but she doesn't appreciate Tom's interference with her work schedule. Without her permission, he went behind her back and persuaded another physician to take over Sophie's patients so they could revel in a romantic tryst in the City of Light. Unfortunately, the Special Air Service summon Tom for an impromptu raid on the Lewis residence at Hampstead Heath in northern London. During this foray, Grace eludes the SAS, but George Clements guns down William in cold blood without giving him a chance to defend himself. This spurs Grace to hijack the train in the English Channel Tunnel.An exciting, suspenseful, rapid-fire shoot'em up, ""SAS: Red Notice"" has no end of complications thwarting both the heroes and villains. When they miss their Paris flight, Tom obtains tickets on the train. He sneaks off the train and harasses Grace until the SAS arrive to negotiate. Meantime, Sophie tends to the injured and wounded. Grace suspects Sophie and Tom are collaborating, but she cannot prove it. Inevitably, treacherous saboteurs create more trouble, but singling them out isn't easy. Altogether, this explosive, high-octane, R-rated melodrama lets one of the villains escape capture, something that only a sequel could mop up. ""SAS: Red Notice"" should gratify action movie enthusiasts.",SAS - Red Notice
7,siderite,Die Hard meets Dexter in a somewhat silly film,7,27 August 2021,"The film's premise is interesting and the cast, all British veterans of Hollywood, is pretty good. Also, I think it's the perfect role for Ruby Rose, where she just plays a murderous psychopath. OK, I am a bit mean with the girl, but she does seem to only have one expression... A bit bummed that it's yet another production where they are making fun of Tom Hopper. Won't the guy get a role where they don't make an ass of him? The movie had pretty high production value as well.Anyway, that's about the good. The bad, quite a lot, too. Some action scenes are good, but most of them are pathetic. The ""twist"" at the end is pointless and the ending overall is really really bad. If we have learned anything from the past is that a movie will only be as successful as its ending and that is why people who really hate this film do.What hurts for me is that this had a lot of potential. It is a terrorist attack in the Eurotunnel in which a highly trained SAS operative is travelling with his soon to be wife. The terrorist is psychopathic and so is our hero. Gasp! Yet the entire thing had a too long a setup and a convoluted ending that detract from the quality of the initial idea. Too bad.Bottom line: I thought that the acting was competent, the premise good, but the script focusing on all the wrong things.",SAS - Red Notice
8,Tweetienator,Mass-Product,3,7 October 2021,"Fast produced action flick of TV-level (streaming services). Nothing remarkable, some explosions and gunfights, sometimes okay, sometimes bad action. The pro: you can put all but one of your brain-cells on sleeping mode. Ruby Rose once gives again a bad ass character, but once again she's (in my opinion) a miscast for that kind of role - they should take some serious female MMA fighters for such role, maybe they can't act but they will manage to give some convincing fighting performances. Anyway, good enough for pop-corn munching time and if you want to feel stupid ;)",SAS - Red Notice
9,alindsay-al,A Poor Action Film,3,20 March 2021,"This film made it's way to Sky Cinema last Friday and last night I sat down and watched SAS: Red Notice and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a small force of trained mercenaries hijack a train where one man has to stop them.Main Character
Sam Heughan plays one of the main characters here and I thought he was okay. He was good in the action scenes and provided a physical presence to the role which aided in the film, also I like some of the things they do with the character in terms of the mental state of the character. But it just isn't handled well enough and Heughan is quite dull in his performance and the film doesn't do a good job of making you like him or care about him. Ruby Rose plays the main villain and I actually thought she was the more interesting character and sold her insanity in a more interesting way. She gives a menacing performance and Rose does as good a job as possible, but in the end her motivations are very dull and it wastes the opportunity given due to her decent performance.Supporting Characters
This cast has plenty of well recognised actors, though they don't exactly get much to work with. Andy Serkis is a nice fun character here, he is completely over the top and kind of like he is in a different film to the rest of the cast but you cannot deny that he is entertaining. But others like Hannah John Kamen, Tom Hopper & Noel Clarke are given very little to work with and despite being good actors the characters are bland and don't offer much to the overall product to the film.Story
The story here is really bland too, this films plot feels like it belongs in the 1990's where action films like this were churned out all of the time. The film wanted to do something unique with the two main characters but the story doesn't do enough to make it interesting and as I said above the whole motivations for the villains is cliché and not well thought. Also the film has twists and turns and I am pretty sure not one of them makes sense and the end of the film cops out and takes the easy way out instead of providing something unique.Script
The script as well is weak and really does hurt the film. It provides cliché motivations and twists that are unnecessary and feel like a poor attempt to try and make the film feel better then it actually is. The film also takes itself really seriously too and kind of misses the point of an action film like this.Style
There are some good action scenes here that are pretty violent and are the best parts of this film. The film is paced pretty well and despite a longer runtime that I would like, I never really felt bored by any of it. Though I think with the other elements of the film being weaker I needed more from the action scenes and some truly memorable sequences which the film doesn't have.Overall
Overall, SAS: Red Notice is a pretty poor film that just feels very forgettable. It has some okay action but there are so many better action films out there and this is one to avoid.",SAS - Red Notice

13,IonicBreezeMachine,Middling would be franchise starter undercut by lack of tension or thrills.,4,15 July 2021,"After video spreads of a massacre in a Georgian village committed by private military contractor Black Swans, Interpol issues a Red Notice on Black Swans leasers William Lewis (Tom Wilkonson) and his adult children Grace (Ruby Rose) and Oliver ""Olly"" (Owain Yeoman). While the official task is to arrest the Black Swans, at the direction of the Prime Minister, High Ranking SAS officer George Clements (Andy Serkis) seeks to kill the Black Swans as not to unleash scandal about the British Government and gas company Britgaz who hired them. The first attempt by the SAS only kills William leaving Grace and Olly to enact their fail safe. With SAS officer Tom Buckingham (Sam Heughan) on board the Eurostream to Paris with his girlfriend (Hannah John-Kamen) with the intent to propose, their trip is soon interrupted as the Black Swans seize the train and ransom the passengers against the British government with only Tom able to act against the Black Swans.Based on the Tom Buckingham series of books by Andy McNab, who also serves as a co-producer and writer on the film, SAS: Red Notice is one of Sky Cinema's original productions made to compete on the same playing field as Amazon and Netflix original films. The film has a rich source with Andy McNab, former SAS veteran turned author, very much the U. K. equivalent to Tom Clancy with his books praised for their details and thrilling action and there's definitely a foundation to be built upon, but unfortunately the film's turgid pacing, blandly staged action, and lack of tensions leads to a slog that ends this franchise before it even starts.Danish Director Magnus Martens has a proven track record with the decent dark comedy film Jackpot adapted from the Jo Nesbo novel as well as experience helming episodes of Banshee and 12 Monkeys, but here Martens finds himself out of his element as he doesn't frame or pace the film like an action thriller and instead treats it more like a procedural with much of the action presented in a rather detached fashion. The movie is basically yet another entry in the ever popular well of Die Hard clones and here the premise feels misjudged with the Eurostream equivalent of the Eurostar being rather cramped in real life in comparison to its film equivalent and even if we overlook that detail the setting isn't all that visually interesting with not much in the way of mining for potential action beats. The movie tries to operate on other levels such as a subplot of a mole (or ""snide"" as they call it) in the SAS but its such a limp attempt at intrigue with really only two possible suspects that the reveal comes off as rather limp and unimpressive (possibly a plant for sequel bait). Some of the shadowy political power plays with Britgaz and the Prime Minister are potentially interesting, but we're often held at a distance from these proceedings despite them being the most engaging.The cast does fine for the most part (even if there's not much to work with), Andy Serkis has fun playing an unscrupulous figure not afraid to get his hands dirty, and I did enjoy Ruby Rose as Grace Lewis. Sam Heughan of TV's outlander as our lead is fine I guess in the film, but there's really not all that much to his character. The movie tries to analyze Psycopathy since Andy McNab has been diagnosed as a functioning Psychopath and incorporates that into some of his characters, but we never really get to feel exactly what that entails with Tom Buckingham and there's not much in the way of depth. There's certainly depth to be mined from protagonists with psychological baggage as seen in reliable staples like Dexter and Hannibal, but the movie just pays lip service to it if even that.SAS: Red Notice is a rather underwhelming military thriller that is reminiscent of the underwhelming international co-productions Euan Lloyd (Who Dares Wins, Fflokes,etc.) made back in the 70s and 80s with a fresh coat of paint. With a rather flat delivery that's lacking in tension and action that's not engaging SAS: Red Notice kills whatever chance it has at a franchise.",SAS - Red Notice

15,bob-the-movie-man,"Psycho vs Psycho, but poorly delivered",3,13 March 2021,"Oh my word, SAS: Red Notice is disappointing.A really interesting cast, and the opportunity to do a mix of ""Die Hard"", ""Daylight"" and the finale of ""Mission Impossible"". And a novel take of 'good psychopath' vs 'bad psychopath'. But it's just so poorly delivered.True that some of the McNab-guided action scenes feel refreshingly authentic. But the script is clunkingly bad (a discussion with a French girl on top of the train... #shudder) and there are story segues that shock (in a bad way): at one point our hero (Sam Huegen - most recently very good as Paul Newman in ""For Olivia"") walks out of a French vineyard into a winter wonderland with 6 inches of snow!

There's no justification for why this piece of crap had to be two hours long. Most of the runtime was just some Brits walking and sneaking around. I was mentally checked out 40 minutes into the movie. The action scenes themselves were too short, which made sense because pretty sure there wasn't enough budget for competent fight scenes.Even worse, this movie tried to be all complexed with an actual premise about psychopaths not being able to feel love, and some rare ones can. This literally made no sense and served no purpose to the movie.

21,stevenrotherforth,The person who wrote the dialogue should get a Red Notice..,4,15 March 2021,"SAS Red Notice'SAS Red Notice' is a Sky Original movie made for TV.
The biggest compliment I can pay this film is that TV movies have come along way over the last decade.
Based on the novel by Andy McNab, it seems that Sky have put their hands into their deep pockets and given this movie a decent budget.
That said none of the said budget was set aside for the dialogue.
This is one cringeworthy movie. All the actors should have been paid a bonus for actually speaking the script out loud!
I won't bore you with a long synopsis. Basically this movie is 'Die Hard' on a train. Or perhaps 'Die Hard' in the channel tunnel.
Sadly though 'SAS Red Notice' has none of the charm or wit that made the Bruce Willis actioner such a hit with audiences worldwide.
Sure there's action aplenty and for the most part it's perfectly serviceable.
Ultimately 'SAS Red Notice' won't be remembered a few days after watching.Despite the awful dialogue, hammy acting there is some fun to be had. A guilty pleasure if you like.
Ruby Rose makes for a pretty decent villain.
Sam Heughan looks the part as the lead action hero but most of his onscreen set pieces are poorly lit and choppily edited.
Even with the use of glorious HDR, darkly lit scenes are mostly unfathomable.
Support from Hannah John-Kamen as the leads love interest is under-utilised.
Kamen is a fine actress but even she struggles to deliver the wince inducing dialogue with any believability.
Leaving Andy Serkis as the scene stealer. He's actually having fun with the films cheesiness and is quite funny in this movie.For Home Theatre enthusiasts 'SAS Red Notice' is worthy of your time.
If you subscribe to Sky TV's UHD service then your in for a treat in terms of image quality.
This is one crisp 4K picture.
I would imagine this was digitally shot as there's no sign of film grain.
HDR for the most part elevates the image and gives muzzle flash and explosions real vibrancy.
Only aforementioned dark scenes can sometimes become muddled.
Sky have been behind the competition regarding High Dynamic Range content but thankfully now they've caught up.
In terms of audio, this movie is presented with a Dolby Atmos mix for those yet again who pay extra for the privilege.
It's a bloody good sound mix too.
Perhaps the movies saving grace.
There's plenty of height channel action. Helicopters sound amazing as they zoom overhead.
Bullets wizz from speaker to speaker with real accuracy giving surround channels a work out.
LFE in terms of explosions and gunfire has authority and can be felt as well as heard.Whilst 'SAS Red Notice' can't be wholeheartedly recommended as a good movie. It is a good movie experience for those who enjoy excellent sound and image quality.
For the rest of us it's just another run of the mill action cheesefest.",SAS - Red Notice

Not to mention, I've major issues with the careless lack of visual consistency in the production... SAS: Red Notice is genuinely FULL of cringe inducing continuity errors; there are inexplicable weather changes within scenes which shift from sunny & warm to freezing snow in a matter of mere moments - with jarring transitions between the two (bless the editor trying to hide them) - in order to help make the artificial aesthetic of the film look that bit more noticeably superficial, unnatural & intentionally manufactured.We haven't even gotten to the bemusing character development or the poor representation of women either... The generic female love interest (reduced to a helplessly weak damsel in distress) has an arc that - considering recent events - I can't quite believe I was seeing; she begins as an apprehensive partner working in the NHS (taught to care for & preserve life), understandably concerned about her male, Poundshop James Bond boyfriend being violent towards women at work, who's undeterred by the loss of it - questioning what that means for her well-being & his perception of her worth / safety - if he's so unnervingly ambivalent towards inflicting harm on those of the opposite sex... And by the end of the film, she becomes an unquestioningly subservient wife, happy for his employment to encroach upon their marriage, actively encouraging him to ""drop her"" - killing another woman - like some sadistic enabler with a new found fetish for killing or being an accomplice to his aggression.We also have the stereotypical female villain - whose only purpose is to die at the hands of this psychopathic protagonist so he can learn something about himself... Everything's centred around MEN & women are in service of THEIR progression. In 2021.What else is there to say but ""yikes"" in response to that?I'm not sure what the creators were hoping to achieve but the voyeuristic glorification of male violence & the outdated gender roles leave a lot to be desired. It's like a cheap, misogynistic knock off of 007 or Sicario - devoid of any nuance or depth. Completely shallow & unimpressive.",SAS - Red Notice

The story is bad, along with the script and some of the acting. Why Wilkinson and Serkis did this is strange.
The storyline is unbelievable and has plot holes everywhere.
The casting is dubious, as the chief baddie played by Ruby Rose is so unconvincing and looks like she'll blow over in the wind.
Serkis' character on the other hand walks around with a Danny Dyer accent using F words in every sentence and is actually quite comical. Unintentionally comical. I really should have turned off after 30 minutes but kept going as others were watching.

93,NotAFilmCritic101001,Bland,2,21 March 2021,"This film is bland, boring and probably would've been received a little better if it came out in the early 90's.The problem is that the narrative of someone trapped in a space while being hunted by 'bad guys' has been done to death. So, to do it now would require some inventive writing and unique new ideas that could reinvent that style of film and make it interesting. Unfortunately, any form of unique/interesting storytelling devices that could've made this film interesting, unique or good are absent.In terms of movies using this 'trapped narrative' it's not an all-bad idea, had it had a different protagonist and antagonist (preferably better actors) I might've enjoyed it. I didn't like either of their performances and they left me disinterested, they weren't unique, they weren't well written and they were a bore to watch.A good example of this trapped narrative done well (lol well not well, but at least entertaining) would be the film lockout, the writer sets it in space to be different and creates a character that's sarcastic and quippy, but oddly likeable.You see, if we're spending so much time with these characters and you write them as interesting and they're acted well, then even if the story's bland at least we as viewers spend time with people that entertain us and can trick us into feeling like we're watching a good movie... but none of that is here. Instead, we get Ruby Rose, whose acting is so bad it's criminal and some dude I've never seen before.Saying all that actually makes it a real shame that they've hired some other really decent actors:Andy Serkis, Tom Wilkinson, Hannah John-Kamen, Owain Yeoman and Noel Clarke (who's passable... I guess)All people that can usually provide a good performance let down by a lazy script, poorly acted antagonist, boring protagonist and a subtext so transparent, lame and ham-fisted you start to think his girlfriend is the actual psycho.Not worth your time, unless of course you like films that just make noise and go ""bang!"", if that's you, then have at it...

Some of the action scenes were almost watchable - but they were completely spoiled by being overly long and very much over the top.

Ruby Rose was diabolically awful (she really needs to find another profession).
Andy Serkis was totally wasted in this.

I have been watching the little travel piece that he and Graham McTavish have running on Starz currently. I think Sam would be a good replacement in the James Bond films, should Daniel Craig actually retire. I think he would bring a long of Scottish flair to the role, a la the late great Sean Connery. Anyway, I found SAS to be a resounding success. Checking into the low ratings that I've seen some give, this film, found that Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 63 on the tomatometer for the critics and a 90 rating for the audience.

Noel Clarke is a decent British actor but is well suited to urban movies and maybe comedies so not sure why he's cast as a lead of an SAS team, the main hero is an unknown (at least to me) and has zero chemistry or acting gravity, Tom hopper in support should have played this role in my view.Then we have the villains, the father is elderly and could have been great but instead more screen time is given to his children. The girl - Ruby Rose is completely unbelievable. I've seen her in a couple of movies now and she's always cast as a bad ass action heroine but she's just never believable and has no charisma.

I wonder if they even let Andy McNab anywhere near the set...The story is pretty much typical big heist/Die Hard stuff with a train, and it drags pretty badly. By the end, I started skipping over resolution because my brain cells couldn't deal with attrition.Acting was okay, I guess. I'm not an actor so I've no idea what's good, but it wasn't outright terrible. The protagonist felt quite bland, as those ex-special-forces airport novel heroes go.I haven't read the book, but I'd imagine Mr. McNab went into fetal position in a shower after seeing the premiere.Watch it if you've got nothing better to do, but you're not losing much if you don't.",SAS - Red Notice

The main protagonist is mildly interesting in that he loves ""winning""(killing people).This trait gets some small amount of exploration towards the end but I wish they did more with it and dared to leave on the bitter note that it sets up.I don't have a problem with Ruby Rose being a action star, I think she probably can do some of the physical work herself but when a grown muscular man has trouble taking her down in a grappling fight I can't help but roll my eyes.Hollywood could do better in portraying strong females and this sort of overcompensation is not the way. Gina Carano or someone like her would be a better fit for that kind of physically strong character.Ruby kind of pulls of the commanding presence at times but I still find it hard to think that anyone would follow her after her dad dies.All in all: this movie is alright if you have very low expectations.

I was on the edge of my seat from the beginning to the end. It is filled with twists and turns throughout. The characters of Tom and Grace are incredibly complicated. They each have psychopathic personalities. Tom uses his for good and Grace uses her for evil. Sam Heughan does a superb job at portraying this deeply flawed character who also has to wrestle with his feelings for Sophie which are counterintuitive to everything in his nature and everything he has learned and experienced in his work as a SAS agent. His love for Sophie is not part of his natural DNA and he often missteps in his relationship with her because he is just not wired that way. Despite their differences Tom and Sophie love each other but she really doesn't understand him until the end of the movie when she sees what his job actually entails and how good he is at it. Ruby Rose conveys her cold calculating character Grace who has no redeeming qualities in a truly dead pan and convincing fashion. The supporting cast also does a great job. Andy McNabb has done a brilliant job at weaving together a very intricate and complicated story of espionage, suspense, drama and action. Benji Morrison's sound track is like another character. It enhances every scene but does not overwhelm. I don't understand the incredibly negative reviews. Some people actually admitted to only watching less than 15 minutes. Others seem to have a beef with Sky TV. Others seem to have personal beefs with one or more of the actors. Others complained it was not realistic or believable. Seriously? This genre of movie is never judged on its realism or believability, because we all know, they never are. I defy any of the naysayers to state an action packed, suspense thriller movie which is realistic or believable, surely none of the wildly successful franchise film movies. Other reviewers had a bone to pick with some minute aspect in the film then condemned the entire movie. I read in disbelief people who thought it was low budget and cheaply or hurriedly made.

However I was pleasantly surprised. Firstly the slight negatives. It is a bit cheesy in parts which I don't get in Andy McNabs books but condensing a 10 hour book into 2 hours I guess there has to be sacrifices to get the story across to the audience. Secondly some of the scenes were on the silly side that not even The A Team would be able to get out of, but that's no difference to a Bond movie! My biggest negative is that in any McNab book, autobiography or fiction he goes into such detail which I really love, sadly not so much in this film. I know he advised on the film Heat to give it a realism on shooting scenes but not sure if that was the case in this movie. Positives are Tom Bucking felt like the same person I had pictured while reading the book and was likeable and for me Andy Serkis stole the show, loved his style in it. Noel Clarke is brilliant and would have liked to have seen more of him.

190,bonnmack,"Not awfu, not great",5,22 April 2021,"The biggest issue with this movie, is that, with great apologies to my British friends, Britain is crappy at making action films. Leave those to Hollywood. So to the actors: Ruby Rose should retire and find another means of employment- I think she has anyway. She was truly awful. Sam Heughan. Well, this guy plays Jamie in outlander and for those viewers who know the Jamie character well, they will recognize many of the same mannerisms, and facial expressions. If Heughan ever hopes to break loose of his strong identification with Jamie, he's going to have learn to change certain aspects of his body and facial language. Was he good in the film? Sorta. I think they tried too hard to make his character multi-dimensional and Heughan seemed to struggle with that. He's larks a spark on the screen - a star power which I believe he can achieve, but he needs a break-through opportunity and great direction to help him ""not be a Jamie"". This was not that film. Outlander may have cooked his goose for future and better opportunities. The scripting of SAS was poor as was the direction - and they weren't of any help to this film. Overall, the film wasn't a complete disaster and now that it rentable, viewing it is not total waste of your time. There are cheesy scenes, there are decent scenes.

If you want to be entertained for a couple of hours SAS: Red Notice is worth your time. You could say that it was petty standard as far as action films BUT it is also unique because it isn't severely over the top. There were many action sequences but they were paced and spread out very well. Plus they seemed realistic. No heavy fake fighting choreography. No over long fight sequences either. The direction must of been ""you know all those other action films well we are going to do that but take it down 20%"". Sometimes less is more. SAS brings it but just the right amount. Plus it showcases some real and unique ways to kill people. The other thing that is interesting is this isn't an action hero movie. The main character Tom Buckingham is not the typical hero. Typical heroes usually kill for a good moral reason. Tom kills because well that is his job and he likes his job. He has a functioning mental disorder called psychopathy which allows him to kill and still sleep at night. One key question moving on for the sequel to come is will Tom Buckingham continue to find his sensitivity chip and become a full feeling person? Sam Heughan and Ruby Rose were great in their respective psychopath rolls. The rest of the cast were good too. I enjoyed the storyline even though at times it seem predictable. The good for me was the action. The bad for me was there was some editing issues and the production level, while decent enough, still could be even better. The great was the acting and the pacing of the movie.

'It's not that bad' is very faint praise,and in my opinion about as accurate as this portrayal of British Special Forces in action.
There are some outstanding Actors in this that I can only think were 'phoning this in' during Covid Lockdown to stay busy!
This was a cause of genuine delight on discovery,but I gave up after 20 minutes as it just got silly.The SAS seem to have bulldozed the RAF Station that was at Credenhill and built what looks like 'Marineville' from 'Stingray'! The flashes of it were so brief though that you couldnt see the Boathouse to check the Colour !

Yes I know that people have to do the things they do but that whole thing of trying to tie a love interest between a doctor and a special forces person was more than a bit forced. And sloppy.

242,stuart-83987,This film deserves a Red Notice ...,1,14 March 2021,"Outstanding, exhilarating and imaginative are three words that I won't be using to describe this film. So many questions remain unanswered, and quite honestly, I really hope they remain that way forevermore.Sky has invested in some truly marvellous productions over the years but someone in the office dropped the ball with this one. So why did Sky shell out for such drivel? McNab (aka Steven Mitchell) has made a fortune out of his volumes of published works over the years, but this latest book-to-film conversion is a painful 2-hour crawl whilst dragging a broken hip.Apart from the existing buildings that were used in the film, many of the tailor-made sets need redesigning: the tunnel entrance is, well you can make your own mind up about that. Then there's the acting talent (or the lack of it). Long, atmospheric looks that pass between the key players are only there to fit around the dramatic chords that go to heighten the tension - and not the other way around. The storyline has more holes than Swiss cheese and is about as convincing as Bill Clinton saying he didn't inhale.Another reason as to why this is such a dire and stilted, cliché ridden disaster is the fact that there are (wait for it) 34 credited producers. There's nothing quite like using the 'camel' comparison here: a camel is a horse that's been designed by a committee, and that's what we have here. A film about a British military unit deployed on British turf was shot abroad but not one of the 34 producers could convince the money people to invest in a UK shoot.The film will probably do well amongst bedroom soldiers, Mitchell has his money but the viewing public now has an awful testimony to bad writing and even worse screenplay.",SAS - Red Notice

You then have several SAS men attempting to kick a door open (that opens outwards...) that they then attempt to hack open with a small craft axe only to find it's metal.... no thought to use a battering ram, compressed air door breaker or even a carefully used breaching round... they then use a shaped charge which they could and would have used after the first thing failed....You then have another huge gaff... Toms fiancé (a dimwitted and totally laughable character who whilst dating a member of a highly secretive anti-terror unit tells random old ladies in the train he kills people for a living... what utter tripe) attempts to warn him by shouting... whilst they (her the captors and Tom) are communicating by text message... who thought that would work?The acting is shocking and most characters are unbelievable to the extreme... Andy Sirkis as an SEnior SAS officer for example is awful casting... as were many others.I could go on but it would take all day...

It just does not make sense as a whole.The acting: sometimes average, but mostly mediocre. In a couple of cases just outright wooden and bad (many mention Ruby Rose - I agree). The SAS operators behaving completely amateurishly in a fight is a dead giveaway.The scenery: a couple of nice aerial views (with one CGI'd so badly, the Eurotunnel seems to turn 90 degrees downwards just to get underwater). The rest is studio-made and a selection of creative filters were applied to make it look more ""actionly"".If I wanted to watch a superhero movie and willingly abandon all logic, I'd watch some fantasy flick or a Batman movie.

Sorry Sam don't call us well call you.We had more fun coming up with alternative working titles. We came up with 'Die Softer' or 'Dover, I've Fallen' (one for the Vic Reeves fan), or Tommy English.Theres only so many time you can hide under a train, or on top of a train, or next to a train and the tension falls flatter than than the train tracks.The 'heist' plot is clunky and unimaginative, which might explain why the director just gives up on it and just edits a series of action sequences together. I say 'edit' but that's being generous. The scenes are slammed together without finesse or care.The political corruption story line is equally mishandled. The UK government is involved, the PM is implicated, but honestly who cares?The dialogue is awful too. Not knowingly bad like a good Arnie movie, just laughably terrible.Do yourself a favour rewatch Kingsman, London has Fallen, Die Hard.

Sam Heughan is amazing with his range of emotions. You can see when his switch is flipped, he could have easily gone to the dark side but refused to. Ruby Rose is great as the villain and does a great job of being cold blooded, stoic, menacing and generally kicking the butts of men twice her size.

And I haven't even talked about the cast. Box office gold all the way with an electrifying performance from Ruby Rose as psychopathic killer Grace Lewis, Tom Wilkinson as her father, Hannah J Kamen as Buckingham's love interest, Andy Serkis, Tom Hopper, Noel Clark and a host of others all do McNabb's storyline justice.
But it's Sam Heughan's exceptional portrayal of an SAS operative coming to terms with his own flawed psyche that brought McNabb's novel and his lead character to life with a brilliant blend of finesse, charm and believability. Forget Bond, Borne, and McLane. Buckingham stands alone in his own lane that Heughan has carved out for him in his beautifully nuanced performance.

Because he is basically a mutant with regeneration powers. Stabs, gun shots, blasts all fail to stop him. He runs, crawls, perches, climbs up and down relentlessly almost in a loop, only stopping to make small talks with little girls about ""love"" or talking to his girlfriend from underneath the toilet. Apart from being omnipotent the hero is a great plumber and is able to disassemble the train toilet (from underneath the train) with amazing ease. The professional private army presents itself as sitting ducks to the hero who effortlessly ""drops"" them all through the movie till the villain is left alone running in snow. The heroine does her part to make the movie miserable. She is thick, since it takes her a gas tunnel blast to understand killing/dropping bad guys is necessary. Once she is enlightened all that she needs to agree to the hero's marriage proposal is a few drops of tears.

429,deannamac,Fun. Better than others are saying.,10,16 March 2021,"Honestly, I wanted to give an 8, but I gave it a 10 to raise its average because some people obviously have an agenda. Movies are subjective. Some of the best picture nominees put me to sleep and make me wish I could turn back time.
So, my thoughts-some in response to other reviews.
1) Definitely not the worst movie ever made--far from it.
2) The acting was not bad. I'll admit I'm a huge Sam Heughan fan, but I have not always liked his movies. I love him as Jamie Fraser in Outlander and Tom Buckingham is my next favorite character. He does an excellent job of playing the aloof, charming, good psychopath who doesn't understand why others think him odd. I won't spoil anything, but when he finally begins to realize he can in fact love another person, WOW. It will tear your guts out! I have seen Sam in numerous roles and interviews and I saw mannerisms and expressions in this that I have never seen before. He embodied the character.
3) Idk why some people don't like Ruby Rose. I heard some people say it was unbelievable that a small woman could be the main villain. Whatever!
4) I will say that agree the sound mixing is bad. The soundtrack by Benji Merrison is great, but it is allowed to overpower the dialogue and I too had to turn on the captions to tell what was being said. Tom Hopper is especially difficult to understand.
5) there are a few problems like, you can't just park a motorcycle on the street and board a train and surely if you are going to Paris for the weekend, you take more than a purse. Maybe the butler had delivered the luggage earlier and maybe picked up the bike. Also, I'm guessing the train does not have 5 inch scissors in triage kits in the bathroom where everyone can access them!
These are problems that could be solved by a bigger budget.Bottom line, it is a fun action movie and I have watched it 3 times. If it comes to a theater near me, I'll go see it on the big screen. Do yourself a favor and grab it from Redbox for $2.00 and decide for yourself. I hope to see more Tom Buckingham movies with Sam Heughan in the future.",SAS - Red Notice

432,montaquecat,An Action Packed Movie,10,24 March 2021,I enjoyed it. I wanted to be entertained and I was. Once it got started it kept you in your seat til the end. It was interesting to see how the two psychopaths dealt with the life around them. Some reviews say that there isn't any chemistry between Tom and Sophie.. he's a psychopath and they usually don't show feelings. I don't think Tom Buckingham (Sam Heughan) realizes that some of the things he says or does away from the job are different than what most people do or say. Grace Lewis (Ruby Rose) on the other hand embraces her feelings. She doesn't care. I enjoyed the Die Hard franchise. I hope we get a few more of these.,SAS - Red Notice

I found that I had empathy for Ruby Rose character which was surprising to me. Having taught a few psychology courses at the college level not too long ago I was impressed with the portrayal of these two different psychopaths... Very realistic portrayals.

I read the reviews out to husband, who is not really into action movies much, space is his thing, and he actually got perturbed at some of the ridiculous reasons that were being listed by people as reasons for not liking the movie. ""Okay! Now I WANT to see this film!"", he said.For me, someone who does not like the violence in action movies, I was ready to pass on this movie even though I like Sam Heughen in ""Outlander"". But, I thought I would try and watch, and just duck when something might upset me, but I didn't really need to do that at any time throughout. Sam became Tom Buckingham and was never Sam Heughen (or Jamie Fraser) for me from the get go. Very believable.Husband says it was what you would expect from a movie of this genre. You have to suspend belief in some details and not nit pick because, after all, it is fiction and an action movie and it's super fast paced.As for Ruby Rose, sorry , we'd not heard of her before this. Some reviewers panned her acting skills. We disagree. She played the part of a emotionally challenged person who had no feelings for anything. She played that part to the hilt. She did well.Some edits had me lost, wondering what happened there? Special effects were good. Supporting characters were fine.I'd watch a sequel if they do make one. This, coming from a very old school, classic movie lover. That's an amazing statement for me. That's saying a lot.Make some popcorn. Watch this movie. I can't say, "" It's good clean fun"".

477,chelendew-54496,Loved This Movie!!,10,13 March 2021,"Based on most of the reviews I've read here, it appears people expect movies to be real life. Newsflash, they aren't. This movie is an adaptation of the book. It is a very good adaptation. I read the book in 2 days. Couldn't put it down. Now, I've watched the movie. I was not disappointed.
I'm not a huge action movie watcher. Honestly, the draw for me was that Sam Heughan was in this as a lead. I wanted to see how he handled the character of Tom Buckingham. Again, I was not disappointed. Sam was brilliant. It was a little (actually more than a little) scary how precisely Sam played a psychopath. He embodied that character entirely. Equally, Ruby Rose was intense as Grace. Two very disciplined actors playing off of each other equals perfection.
The film was cast perfectly. The dynamic between Sophie and Tom was just as it was in the book. The chemistry between Hannah and Sam was perfect for the characters and the journey they were going through. Hannah was a very strong Sophie. I was extremely impressed.
The supporting cast was fantastic. Each playing their parts successfully. The storyline of the movie took the book's written word and condensed it in ways that worked. That does not often happen when bringing a book to film. It works in this one. If there was much CGI in this movie, I didn't notice it. With exception to the dilating pupils, which made the emotion of the characters evident (and I loved it), I didn't notice any other CGI. It was pretty flawless. Okay, maybe the helicopter smashing into the tower was a bit obvious, but that was about it.
Lets talk about the MUSIC. The music was EVERYTHING in this movie. I LOVE this soundtrack in it's entirety. It helped with the flow of the movie. It helped to define the characters and the action. The music was perfect.
Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and plan to watch it again. I expect there are several new things that I will pick up on in subsequent viewings. If you enjoy action movies, I would recommend it. Just remember, it's a MOVIE. NOT real life.",SAS - Red Notice

Both him and Ruby Rose are so amazingly attractive. In fact all the cast were great, Andy Serkis can do no wrong. I think it helps to know more about Andy McNab's story and how Tom finds more about himself as the story unfolds. Extremely watchable don't let the bad reviews put you off.

Well, it may be low budget - but to me it looked and sounded more realistic - I think the abrupt editing made it seem more ""documentary"" - it was also a choice. No, the plot is not uber realistic but then no worse than other action movies. I think Sam nailed it. I would certainly watch the sequel. An 8 from me. Watched a second time - still good!",SAS - Red Notice

Sam's interactions with Tom Hopper were some of the best parts of the film.

The sets looked believable (and they were gorgeous) The action seemed believable. The twists and turns in the movie were also believable (in others words I did not find myself saying ""Oh ffs, come on!"" Like in many other movies). Cinematography/Lighting were beyond excellent. The acting was great, and not over the top. The actors did their jobs, and they did them well. Remember that this movie did not have the budget of those Hollywood blockbusters, so no it is not a Bond film, however, it truly holds it's own!The only reason I gave it a 9 instead of 10 is because I would have liked a little more development of the psychology behind Tom's character and psychopathic tendencies. Indeed, it was touched on, but I look forward to a sequel where we can delve much further into his internal mental/emotional conflicts.All in all, an action movie definitely worth your while.

Sam I thought was perfect as Tom Buckingham, playing the role of an ex special forces soldier who has a psycopathic personality, with a chilling calmness and yet he manages to portray warmth, charm, sensitivity and emotional depth captivating the us whenever he was on the screen, especially in scenes with his beautiful co-star Hannah John Karmen with whom he also had great onscreen chemistry! Ruby Rose is very good as the antagonist as are the rest of the superb supporting cast including Andy serkis, Noel Clarke and Tom Hopper each of whom give their own delightful touch to their performances making the whole movie a joy to watch!Finally I would just like to add, the excellent score by Benji merrison brings the whole thing together with a wonderful sense of thrill and excitement. I gave it 9stars, instead of 10 because I found some of the political subplots with the prime minister slowed the pace a little, other than that it was very enjoyable so grab your popcorn and watch this movie, you're going to love it and watch it over and over again as it becomes a firm favourite like it has of mine.",SAS - Red Notice

587,laurenstefaniewalker,"Not Bad, needs better character development.",6,24 March 2021,"Overall the film isn't bad and as a franchise has potential. The biggest thing was the overall lack of character development. It felt like the actors had an understanding of their back stories, but for any audience members unfamiliar with the book, it was hard to follow. It is alluded to that the main character, Tom, had a grandmother who was also a psychopath. He asks his servant about her capacity to love. However, we are left wondering the extent of his relationship to his family and why he feels his parents did not condone his lifestyle/behavior. Was the grandmother his closest relative in a sea of people who didn't understand him? Did he actually know her, or did he only hear stories about her? As someone who did not read the book, I'm unsure if those questions are answered. Sam Heughan was fairly convincing as a psychopath as he did come across as very detached and nonchalant about death and emotion. He was almost like a robot who wanted to know what it was like to feel. It's also a character type we see often, someone searching for their place and identity, which he believes he has found with Sophie. Even if he can't love, at least she gets it and he needs that foundation. Black Swan also lacked back stories. It is implied that both the father and daughter are psychopaths and much to his father's disappointment, the son is not. We know that even though Ruby Rose's character does not have the capacity for love she has a capacity for loyalty. This is demonstrated by her relationship with her brother. However, all of this was just hinted at. We have no real understanding of the characters' motivations. There was so much potential for diving into the mindsets of the characters and creating a more well rounded story. The casting was fine, but I felt the script lacking. We are left still not truly understanding any of the characters. We know that Tom is starting to come to terms with being different from most people and that doesn't make him a bad person. We know Sophie has chosen to accept Tom as he is and support him on this journey. That's it. We see nothing of the other character's motivations and growth. It left me feeling like I had more questions than answers. The action sequences were well shot and fun to watch. It was also left open ended for a potential sequel. If they do decide to make a sequel, I hope they decide to add more background story for the essential characters.

But that was only part of the issue.The biggest failure, atleast from my perspective, was how significantly the producers failed to convey even an ounce of realism. Considering this movie was largely based around the SAS (given the title), one would immediately make comparisons to the likes of ""Who Dares Wins"" or ""Ultimate Force"", which both featured a fair degree of realism in terms of the British Military.However this movie seems to have been put together by a team who had no idea who the SAS are, let alone how they might perform or even what equipment they may use... From make-believe weapons, to Generals with cockney accents, this seems to take everything ""genuine"" that may be associated with the British Military, and throw it out of the window.After 20 minutes of watching this movie, I was prepared to turn it off, but I was so disgusted I wanted to write a review, and thus felt I needed to watch it until it's shameful conclusion to reputably do so.",SAS - Red Notice

How can these so called actors live with themselves producing such dross the charracters are unsurprisingly so unbelievable it is unimmaginable ever for sky's usual gender nuetral approach the main characters besmirch the good name of the SAS and Andy circus should stick to chimps.

749,imdb-85172,Absolutely terrible,1,14 March 2021,"I was excited to watch this as I read the book a few years back, but was so disappointed with the film. It was laced with abysmal cliche, bad acting and jus t a cheesy film that made me cringe - I forced my way to the end just in case it got better but it didnt. Save yourself some time and done watch it.",SAS - Red Notice
750,jeffdw-21738,Unbelievably bad!!!!!!!,1,13 March 2021,"I was so looking forward to this film.
Throughout the film I was cringing and shaking my head in disbelief at how bad it was.
It could've been so much better, an amateur could've made a better film.
The worst film I've ever seen!!
I have to seriously question some accounts giving this 10/10?????",SAS - Red Notice
751,mykee-84098,Worse then a generic action film,3,5 September 2021,"There's only a handful of films that I consider truly awful - Skyline and Bliss being at the very top of my list. But this movie is one to add to that list. I'm very easy going when it comes to movies. Even the most generic action film is alright in my books as long as I walk away from it feeling like I didn't waste my time. However, this was really bad. I can buy Ruby as a psycho badass action star - I thought she did pretty well in John Wick 2 but there are one too many moments where you can tell she's acting. The tone of someone who's supposed to be a calculating killer switches to that of a California valley girl far too often. My real issue is with Sam Heughan. I can't stand pretty boys cast as spec ops soldiers who then try to act tough through the whole movie. There's a scene where he walks through a train looking for Ruby and every time he looks at someone he squints his eyes and clenches his jaw and tries to act super serious. He continues doing this through the rest of the movie. It really set me off. The writing is terribly bad and I'm not just talking about the dialogue. There's a character who seems to be texting suspiciously to Ruby's character - and we actually see the texts he's sending - only for it to have been a feint as it turns out it's a different character that was texting Ruby. So what the heck were those texts? There's another instance when Sam has been killing people left and right and then he sneaks up on someone and instead of killing him, he tries to get him to surrender just so they can have a fist fight. Near the end of the movie, a gas line explodes but instead of the explosion traveling down the pipe, the end of the pipe somehow explodes first just so Sam can get hit with the shockwave as opposed to Ruby so that Ruby can get away. I'm all for suspension of disbelief but come on, there are some common sense things you can't overlook. We haven't gotten to the fact that there's an absolutely cringe catch phrase used in the movie. In any circumstance, flat out saying ""Avengers, assemble"" would be pretty lame. That's why when Steve was about to say it at the end of Age of Ultron only to be cut off, it worked because there was no reason for him to say it. But when he said it in Endgame at the height of all the emotion with everyone coming back to life, and staring down Thanos and his army with the Avengers' own army, it was perfect. Saying ""Drop her"" while you're bleeding out and trying to have a heart to heart conversation with your boyfriend while a terrorist gets away and then sharing a passionate kiss is flat out stupid. Saying it again when he gets a phone call from his boss, who is somehow not getting prosecuted even though he was caught on film admitting that he sanctioned the killing of a village, while you're getting married when 20 seconds ago you said you couldn't marry him only to change your mind 10 seconds later because he shed a tear is also VERY stupid. The way the movie was shot was equally terrible. I'm not saying it should have been up close and personal and shaky cam like a Bourne film, but this honestly felt like it was shot like a Hallmark holiday movie. There was no tension in any of the shots even when there is a full on firefight. This could have been a decent Die Hard type film but it was just not executed well. Andy, Hannah, Jing, Ray and even Ruby would do well to strike this from their reels and film credits. This was bad. Skip this. You're not missing anything.",SAS - Red Notice

There are too many places where reality has been stretched too far, I won't list them as they should be in Goofs! I love that the SAS were using top of the range brand new black Range Rovers!The dialogue is weak, the acting wooden. It was a waste of the reasonably good locations and CGI.Am I glad I watched it - Yes
Would I recommend it - No.",SAS - Red Notice
756,hazel_ross,Great action film.,10,18 March 2021,"My family just love action films that keep you in suspense and on the edge of your seat. This film did not disappoint.
The main characters where extremely well portrayed especially Tom Buckingham aka(Sam Heughan) Tom is the hero and his character certainly made u believe he was In the real SAS
We have since watched it again and enjoyed it just had much. Well done Andy McNab who wrote the novel . Please make more and keep Tom Buckingham in them (Sam Heughan ) perfect actor for the character.",SAS - Red Notice
757,jennibeard,"Tries too hard on too many levels, gets none of them right...",4,15 May 2021,"Quite a good cast - pity the direction seems to have been absent from the shoot.I really enjoyed the performance of Ruby Rose I saw huge commitment from her, and as much as I enjoyed her contribution to the storyline equally I felt the Doctor Girlfriend role should have been dropped - it brought nothing to the plot except unnecessary cheesy eeeu.. Her unforgettable, all equally bad ""drop him""'s will have me cringing on her behalf for ages....oooops.I would love to see Sam Heughan playing a serious role ... soon. I am sure there is more to him than muscles and sex appeal and he owes it to himself to escape the stereotype - in this movie - same Sam, different Jamie. Additionally one wonders at various points during the movie - are we James Bonding here? Answer: trying, but not successfully.As for the plot - some parts so good, some parts so ridiculous - how does the gas line assume a pseudo ""train station"" where everybody just ""pops out"" seemingly at a predestined place? Said gas line having already been blown up LOL. At this point I was confused, maybe this movie had been a comedy all along.If anyone remakes this movie in the future - the liaison should be between SAS hero and Swan daughter - such energy there, and great potential for on screen polar-opposite attraction; magnetic conflict. By the way - why did you even need a Swan brother here.... like so many others, could have saved money on the budget - drop the role.Ah well, not all bad.",SAS - Red Notice

Ruby Rose is one of the worst actors I've ever witnessed. The only time she was convincing was her death scene. Sam Heughan trying to sound posh was just silly. Every scene was painful to watch.

767,MrEastman,Good actors wasted on a terrible film.,2,13 March 2021,"Like many of the absolute trash movies I watched as a kid in the 90's and thought were amazingly cool, this one is just as rubbish, and 13 year old me would have loved it. As a 40 year old man, on the other hand, this was a travesty, a complete waste of anyone's time, and the only reason I suffered through it was because it was like I imagine watching a trainwreck happening would be: just so unbelievably terrible you can't look away even though it horrifies you.Many of the actors in it are obviously good actors (I mean, come on, Andy Serkis does have acting chops) but they were given a bum deal here, and the acting isn't the issue here. The story is bad, the pacing terrible, there's no character to really root for because they are mostly all equally terrible people, except for the doctor.Do yourself a favour and don't watch SAS: Red Notice (2021). It's not even one of those so-bad-it's-hilariously-good movies. It's just plain and simply a bad movie.",SAS - Red Notice
