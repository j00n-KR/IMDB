0,TheLittleSongbird,"Not quite heavenly, though far from hellish",7,2 October 2019,"'Kingdom of Heaven' had an immensely talented cast going for it, despite being unsure about seeing Orlando Bloom in an especially substantial lead role. It also looked great from the trailer, and have liked a good deal of Harry Gregson-Williams' work which can be one of the better components of films. Ridley Scott is not the most consistent of directors, his best films like 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner' are brilliant but lesser films such as 'Robin Hood' are really not good (personal opinion of course).There are also films of his that are much better in the director's cut version. 'Legend' is one such example, but the biggest one for me is 'Kingdom of Heaven'. Found it a very mixed bag as the theatrical/ non-director's cut version and found a lot of issues with it (and this is actually forgetting the historical inaccuracies), such as choppy storytelling, erratic pacing and underwritten characters on top of Orlando Bloom and the dialogue. While it is still not a perfect film still in the director's cut version, it is a big improvement and some of what were major problems in the theatrical version are corrected.Not all though. Do still find Orlando Bloom charisma-void and out of his depth, have nothing against him but this role was a meaty one, even more so in the director's cut where he is more complex, and needed a lot of authority and a wide range of emotions and to me Bloom didn't have enough of either.Some of the middle of the film stalls a bit in the pace, the storytelling not always going very far. Although the characters are much more interesting in the director's cut edition, a few of them could still have gotten into more depth such as those with not much screen time still and the same goes with the themes, also did that the messaging at times could have been more subtle.Improvements are many though. The characters generally are far more interesting and better developed, Eva Green's went from one that one questioned the presence of and was hugely underwritten to a well fleshed out character. They interacted more convincingly and not in as stilted a fashion. Despite some aimlessness in the middle, the pace is less erratic and doesn't jump around as much. The story is uneven still, but there is generally more cohesion and less choppiness, more of a sense of resolution with the vast amount going on and for me the contemporary relevance was a good thing.Dialogue flows better and is less awkward, quite intelligent here too.Both editions cannot be faulted visually. It is gorgeously shot with lots of atmosphere and the costumes and sets are stunningly evocative, with the siege especially being quite breath-taking. In fact, the action was very tense and powerful in both versions as well but especially in the director's cut. Harry Gregson Williams' score rouses and also has emotional impact, the director's cut does it more justice and a better job is done complementing everything whereas in the theatrical version it was the case of a great score deserving a much better film. Scott directs everything skillfully which is remarkable considering there was a lot to balance. The messaging and everything regarding tolerance and the historical inaccuracies were much criticised and still are, they weren't as big an issue for me.With the exception of Bloom, the cast are very good. The standouts being an against type Edward Norton who gives a lot of complexity and intensity to his character and Gasshan Massoud showing how to do cool and menacing wonderfully. Eva Green's performance is deeply felt and Jeremy Irons shows a lot of dignity and restraint here.Overall, didn't care for the theatrical version, but this review is namely for the director's cut which is an infinitely better, if imperfect, version and is a fairer way to judge the film on. My thoughts though. 7/10",Kingdom of Heaven
1,Leofwine_draca,Too much moralising and too little action,5,13 August 2016,"Ridley Scott's latest historical epic is a real disappointment for those of us who considered GLADIATOR to be a modern classic. KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is everything that film wasn't; it's over-long, poorly acted, and often sloppy when it comes to the editing and scripting. A two and a half hour adventure film that barely contains any decent action is truly disgraceful, and this slow-paced effort often takes the biscuit. The trailers cram in just about every battle the film contains, making it look exciting throughout, but after the first half hour the interest wanes and the viewers are left squirming in their seats, facing one irrelevant sequence after another.The highlight of the film for me is a stunning siege sequence in which the Arabs lay waste to Jerusalem, utilising Greek fire and siege engines to storm and breach the walls. The pyrotechnic effects are wonderful and the sheer spectacle of this moment equals that of RETURN OF THE KING. However, this occupies only fifteen minutes of the movie, and, like ROTK, there are multiple layered endings which really test the patience. The film incorporates a useless love interest with no acting talent whatsoever, and for some reason keeps cutting back to her face during the battle, really ruining the excitement. Scott seems like an amateur here with little real talent.As for the hero, Bloom is adequate in the role but a little too mock-serious, a little boring. His speech sequences are the worst in the movie and should have been cut. However, he has a stellar supporting cast, including heavyweight support from Liam Neeson and Jeremy Irons; Brendan Gleeson pops up again, and this time goes way over the top. Edward Norton is unrecognisable as the sympathetic leper king whilst Marton Csokas is a slimy templar bad guy who just disappears towards the end of the movie.The action sequences are like those in most modern Hollywood offerings, sharply edited so you can't make out much what's going on, and aside from a couple of sequences the violence is limited to blood spraying in the air. The sound effects are actually decent though, complemented by an effective score, so expect lots of sweeping music and clashing steel as the film plays out. The visuals are also spectacular with fabulous, huge sets and beautiful scenery. However, the problem is that Scott goes out of his way to make this film seem 'epic', and it's clearly not, just a tiresome moralising story about religion with some half-hearted action added in.",Kingdom of Heaven
2,SnoopyStyle,The PC crusade,5,29 November 2013,"Balian de Ibelin (Orlando Bloom) is a simple blacksmith. His wife commits suicide after the death of their son. Godfrey de Ibelin (Liam Neeson) comes to town to tell him that he is his bastard child. Godfrey is on his way back to Jerusalem. Balian kills the judgmental priest (Michael Sheen) in a fit of rage. Balian decide to join Godfrey to go to Jerusalem to seek redemption for him and his wife. The King of Jerusalem is a modern religious pluralist and has relative peace with Saladin for 6 years. The King is opposed by Christian fundamentalists who wants to battle the Muslims.I have several problems with this movie. It seems that Ridley Scott is trying so hard to have a PC crusade. The sensibility is so modern that it rings false. The worst has to Orlando Bloom. He is the moody dour matinée movie star. It's depressing how uncompelling his performance is. And he is the creation of 21th century morality. It is hard to ignore the modernity of our hero.There's no doubt that Ridley Scott knows big action. And the action is really CGI big. But it is lacking any drama or tension. Just because it's big, it doesn't mean I can recommend it.",Kingdom of Heaven
3,claudio_carvalho,"With a Better Story and Less Special Effects, Might Be a Great Film",7,7 December 2005,"I really had a great expectation with ""Kingdom of Heaven"": beginning with the name of Ridley Scott, one of the greatest directors of Hollywood, the awesome cast and last but not the least the very high budget available for the production. Unfortunately, the confused flawed unreasonable story does not work well, and in the end I was disappointed. Balian (Orlando Bloom), the lead character, is a blacksmith and bastard son of a noble, Godfrey (Liam Neeson), that is going to Jerusalem and discloses to Balian that he is his father and invites Balian to join him in his journey. In the end of the story, Balian is absurdly a great strategist and leader as if he had a military formation. There are so many holes and inconsistencies along the screenplay that irritated me that I would make a long list, and certainly it would be incomplete. The excessive use of special effects is also awful, and when Jerusalem is bombed by the Muslims, I recalled the recent bombing of Iraq. The quantity of warriors looks like ants in an anthill, and the excessive splash of blood in the battles would be joyful for a vampire, but I found of a totally bad taste. The cinematography and the performances of the actors are excellent, and it was good to see the gorgeous Eva Green, from ""The Dreamers"", again. ""Kingdom of Heaven"" with a better story and less special effects might be a great film; the way it is, it is only a reasonable and forgettable entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Cruzada"" (""Cruzade"")",Kingdom of Heaven
4,kosmasp,8/10 for the DC!,7,20 May 2007,"The Directors Cut of the movie (released on a 4-DVD Box Set) is the one to watch here! It adds subplots and character moments (i.e. the kid from Eva Green's character) that are missing from the cut that was shown in cinemas. And although that was clear before I went to the cinema, I still wanted to watch this epic in a theatre.And I wasn't disappointed. The action is good, Orlando is a good lead and the other actors are good too (I'd like to mention/point out Eva Greens performance)! One thing that I liked, was the fact, that the movie tried to show the war/battle, without the usual good guys versus bad guys premise. You have good guys on both sides, but of course also bad guys, who just want war! It's a thin line not to get into clichés with that premise, but I think the movie holds it's own!",Kingdom of Heaven
5,classicsoncall,"""By what you decide to do every day, you will be a good man. Or not.""",9,14 December 2020,"Without even a hint of knowing how historically accurate this film is, ""Kingdom of Heaven"" serves as a sweeping and expansive story, wonderfully rendered with gorgeous sets, costuming and cinematography to make the most of it's subject matter. I wasn't quite sure what to make of Orlando Bloom in such an important leading role, as he didn't appear to have the gravitas required of a leader to go up against the likes of Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas), Reynald de Chatillon (Brendan Gleeson), and most significantly, the Muslim warrior leader Saladin (Ghassan Massoud). It may have been his age for one thing, but his bearing and forcefulness didn't seem to be as much in evidence as I would have liked. All the others mentioned appeared to have the world weary look of men who had seen and done a lot in a world of intrigue and positioning for power. Quite remarkably, as defender of Jerusalem, Balian de Ibelin (Bloom) demonstrated remarkable courage along with judicious temperament in surrendering the city to a significantly larger threatening force led by Saladin, who in his own way offers a compassionate way for Balian to save face among his people, by guaranteeing safe passage for all among them to Christian lands. Having seen only the theatrical version as opposed to the director's cut of the movie, I'd still recommend it for it's moving story set during the 12th Century Crusades.",Kingdom of Heaven
6,jboothmillard,Kingdom of Heaven,6,18 February 2008,"The critics give this film from director Sir Ridley Scott (Gladiator) four stars out of five, maybe I'd agree if I was paying full attention to everything. As far as I remember, it is 1184, the Middle Ages, during the time of the Crusades in Jerusalem, and blacksmith Balian De Ibelin (Orlando Bloom) has lost his family, including father Godfrey (Liam Neeson), and nearly his faith. He is taken into the war for the Holy Land, falls in love with Sibylla (Casino Royale's Eva Green), and becomes the leader to defend the city. That's the brief summation, I can't really remember much else besides the interesting battles, similar to those in The Lord of the Rings, well, and some of the other good actors. Also starring Jeremy Irons as Tiberias, Harry Potter's David Thewlis as Hospitaler, 28 Days Later's Brendan Gleeson as Reynald, Marton Csokas as Guy De Lusignan , Ghassan Massoud as Saladin, Fight Club's Edward Norton as King Baldwin, Alexander Siddig as Nasir, The Queen's Michael Sheen as Priest, Kevin McKidd as English Sergeant, Jon Finch as Jerusalem and Iain Glen as Richard Coeur De Lion. I would probably watch this again to understand it fully, and appreciate, but I don't think it'll happen anytime soon. Good!",Kingdom of Heaven
7,rmax304823,Piece Be Upon You.,6,3 August 2006,"Some of the names are real enough -- King Baldwin and Saladin -- but I don't know how accurate a picture this is of what looks like the Second Crusades. (I missed the first couple of minutes.) I vaguely remember that Tiberia was captured by Salahudin, but maybe not.Basically, Jerusalem is run by the Christians here but threatened by Moslems. There's a good deal of treachery, especially by some of the rogue Christians. Oh, and there are references to Jews being in the city too.The city winds up in the hands of a blacksmith-turned-nobleman, Orlando Bloom, who's true blue and gallant and smart and handsome. His ultimate foe, Salahudin, is played by a guy who resembles Lee Van Cleef in his villainy mode, but who is clever, determined, and honorable. (A riveting dramatic performance by the Syrian actor.) I would like to add ""wise"" to that list, because that's what the writers evidently intended, but Salahudin is only given one chance to display his smarts. ""What is Jerusalem worth?"" asks the blacksmith. Salahudin shrugs, says, ""Nothing,"" and begins to walk away -- then stops to look back, smiles, and says, ""Everything."" This prompts the viewer to wonder if he's a Moslem at all because he sounds like a closet Buddhist to at least one viewer, namely me. The climax of the movie is an epic battle at the walls of Jerusalem in which both sides suffer appalling losses, and the blacksmith finally accepts Salahudin's offer of safe passage for everyone out of the city, and the Christian surrenders Jerusalem to save lives in the face of impossible odds.The blacksmith I should add, as if it were necessary, gets the stunning widow of a nasty Christian.The movie's point of view is the sort that can be called balanced. The Crusaders were a jealous and scheming lot, when you get right down to it. (We don't get to know so much about the Moslems.) The Knights Templars were hanged regularly. The children's crusade (not in the movie) was exploited by Christian communities they passed through and resembled the rush of lemmings off a cliff. Still a Christian is a Christian. And during the climactic battle, Bloom the blacksmith organizes the most effective and deadly possible defense of his city. He sites in his artillery and blows the swarthy Wogs and their terrible siege towers apart. The movie may be balanced but we've seen this sort of thing so often before. A noble band of blooders defending a position against an overwhelming force. They hunker down and take a beating then, when the enemy is smirking and coming in for the kill, the survivors rise and clobber them with all sorts of unexpected devices and techniques. (If you doubt it's a familiar scenario, cf. ""Wake Island"" or ""Bataan."") Yes, it's a balanced movie except that the entire audience will be whistling and cheering when the Crusaders disarticulate their attackers.I hate to keep carping but if I remember, this is putting the cart before the horse. Actually, the Crusaders learned about the art of fortification from the Moslems and brought it back to Europe. There followed the Age of Great Forts. Richard the Lionheart, who is glimpsed at the end as he leads still another Crusade, built a monster of a fort in Normandy.I can see why this film was made when it was -- 2005. The Middle East in turmoil once again. Zealots on both sides. Treachery abounding. I suppose the message is that ""plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose."" The world is full of constants, such as the speed of light and conflict in the Middle East.The movie gives us the blacksmith as hero -- but he surrenders Jerusalem, rather than fight to the death and have his women and children butchered by Saladin, as the Christians butchered everyone when THEY first took the city. Oh, it's all sugary sweet, and the city cheers when he announces that they are all safe. But it's ""cut and run"" nonetheless, isn't it? We see Bloom in battle. He's heroic. But in some ways the most courageous thing he does in the entire long movie is surrender a few square miles of stones and streets in order to save a thousand innocent lives. Jerusalem itself had no value except as a symbol. Salahudin, come to think of it, is given a second wisecrack that suggests a certain perspicacity. When Bloom tells him that before he, Salahudin, takes the city, he, Bloom, will burn it to the ground and destroy every sacred stone. ""Maybe that would be the best thing,"" replies Salahudin.",Kingdom of Heaven

9,moonspinner55,Orlando Bloom as a Warrior Messiah,4,1 January 2006,"Director Ridley Scott is starting to repeat himself: here's another sword-laden epic, this one covering three (count 'em, three) long crusades. Dark Ages tale begins in 1184 France, with a widower blacksmith meeting his absentee father, traveling to downtrodden Jerusalem and defending the country against its many enemies. Overlong, ugly and dusty, with interchangeable villains and repetitive brutality. The action, hyped up by the speed-freak editor, turns out to be a bore, so confusingly staged and shot you have no idea who's dying, who's dead, or who's still alive. After one particularly nasty battle, Orlando Bloom comes away with just a few scratches. It's nearly impossible to keep track of the characters, or to care about them; towards the finish, when the many epilogues get crushed together, a scorecard would seem irrelevant. We are meant to be moved by the hero's sensitivity to the Queen and the sudden need to show his manners and manhood, but these characters have not been fleshed out by the writer, and Scott keeps pushing things along, when even the obligatory sex scene is given the short shrift in favor of more dust, noise and bloodshed. *1/2 from ****",Kingdom of Heaven
10,michaelRokeefe,"A sweeping tale of honor, devotion and conscience.",7,12 November 2005,"Ridley Scott directs this epic sage set during the Crusades of the 12th century. Balian(Orlando Bloom)is a French blacksmith, who is grieving the loss of his wife and young child. Balian is approached by his estranged father Godfrey(Liam Neeson), who is a Baron of the king of Jerusalem. After murdering the priest(Michael Sheen)responsible for the beheading of his wife, Balian joins his father and thus is thrust into a decades-long war. Balian will serve and obey a doomed king, rise from common man to knighthood and fall in love with the king's sister, the lovely Sibylla(Eva Green). In time, Balian must protect the people of Jerusalem from overwhelming fighting forces while striving to maintain a fragile peace.KINGDOM OF HEAVEN features graphic, brutal scenes of battle. The running time of 2 hrs 25 minutes does not take anything away from enjoying this film. Awesome scenery and the untapped energy between Bloom and Green cause interest.

11,sunwarrior13,Kingdom Of Heaven Fails Reach The Potential To Be A Masterpiece,9,16 October 2012,"Ridley Scott directed this epic-scale historical drama,Kingdom Of Heaven.It is inspired by the events of the Crusades of the 12th century.It has an ensemble cast that includes Orlando Bloom, Eva Green, Jeremy Irons, David Thewlis, Marton Csokas, Brendan Gleeson, Kevin McKidd, Alexander Siddig, Ghassan Massoud, Edward Norton, Jon Finch, Michael Sheen and Liam Neeson.The story is set during the Crusades of the 12th century. A French village blacksmith goes to aid the city of Jerusalem in its defense against the Kurdish Muslim leader Saladin, who is battling to reclaim the city from the Christians leading to the Battle of Hattin. The film script is a heavily fictionalized portrayal of Balian of Ibelin.Balian is a humble French blacksmith who is searching for a reason to go on after the death of his wife and children. Balian is approached by Godfrey of Ibelin, a fabled knight who has briefly returned home after serving in the East. Godfrey informs Balian that he is his true father, and urges the blacksmith to join him as he and his forces journey to Jerusalem to help defend the holy city. Balian accepts, and he and Godfrey arrive during the lull between the Second and Third Crusades, in which the city is enjoying a fragile peace. Both Christian and Muslim forces are temporarily in retreat, thanks to the wisdom of the Christian monarch King Baldwin IV, his second-in-command Tiberias, and Muslim potentate Saladin. Violent agitators on both sides are foolishly eager to end the peace in a bid for greater power, and Saladin bows to pressures from Muslim factions; Godfrey is one of a handful of brave knights who has thrown his allegiance behind Baldwin IV and his community of diversity, and Balian joins him as they use their skills as warriors in a bid to build a lasting peace. Kingdom of Heaven is greater than the sum of its parts, delivering a vital, mostly engrossing tale.Added to that,it is an extraordinary work of art, a plea for religious tolerance that works because of sheer film making prowess and good, old-fashioned storytelling.Unfortunately,it lacks depth and the biggest shortcoming of this crusader story is not that Scott twists the facts but that he can't elevate the story to something more than an alluring re-creation despite the fact that the battle sequences here are actually worth the cost of admission, and there is exemplary supporting work by Liam Neeson, Jeremy Irons, Edward Norton and especially Ghassan Massoud as the legendary Muslim leader Saladin.And of course,Orlando Bloom is talented enough to star and sustain a $100 million costume drama.Overall,this does not reach its potential to become a masterpiece despite of the talent involved since it does not touch the viewer's heart.",Kingdom of Heaven
12,hitchcockthelegend,Kingdom of Heaven: Director's Cut.,10,18 May 2011,"""There can be no victory except through God""Kingdom of Heaven is directed by Ridley Scott and written by William Monahan. It stars Orlando Bloom, Eva Green, Marton Csokas, Jeremy Irons, Liam Neeson, Alexander Siddig, David Thewlis, Ghassan Massoud and Edward Norton. Cinematography is by John Mathieson and music scored by Harry Gregson-Williams.Director's Cut, two words that has these days come to mean a marketing ploy to get the home movie fan to part with more cash. Except maybe when they call it something else, such as Unrated Edition or Extended Edition, the Director's Cut has rarely been more than the original theatrical version with some added bits sewed back in. Case in point Ridley Scott's own Gladiator. But Scott is a big advocate of the home formats available to us, and what he says in his introduction on these releases are always telling. Kingdom of Heaven: Director's Cut is one of the rare cases that deserves the label, it is the cut Scott wanted and with 45 minutes extra in the film, it's now a fully formed epic and without doubt a better film than the one the theatrical cut suggested.Nutshell plotting finds the story set during the Crusades of the 12th century. Balian (Bloom) is a French village blacksmith who after finally meeting his father Godfrey (Neeson), sets him on a course to aid the city of Jerusalem in its defence against the Muslim leader Saladin (Massoud). Saladin is battling to reclaim the city from the Christians. It's a fictionalised account of Balian de Ibelin the man, but with the Crusades featuring so rarely in movies it's good to see one with attention to detail in relation to the events and time period.Now this version exists there is no reason to visit the theatrical cut, for although this has one or two missteps in the narrative, big holes have been plugged and characters importantly expanded. Benefiting the most are Eva Green as Sibylla, and Bloom himself as Balian. The former now gets substance on why she transforms from a measured princess to a borderline head-case, and the latter gets a back story which helps us understand why he does what he does. Both actors performances are seen in better light as their characters become more defined. Neeson and Norton, too, also get more screen time, and that can never be a bad thing.In this day and age the topicality of the film as regards Muslims and Christians is obviously hard to ignore, but Scott and Monahan are not in the market for political posturing. Scott had long wanted to do a film about The Crusades, to make it an historical epic adventure reflecting the period, and he has achieved that without head banging messages. In fact the culmination of the films major battle comes by way of tolerance, compassion and mutual respect, not by over the top histrionics or side picking. It's a crucial point to note that the makers have not demonized the Arab leaders, both Saladin and Nasir (Siddig) are portrayed as intelligent and cultured men of standing. Their drive and determination coming off as respectful as Balian's defence of Jerusalem is. They also provide the film with two of its best acting performances. Impressive considering the film is full of very good acting turns.It will come as no surprise to fans of Scott's work to find that Kingdom of Heaven is tremendous on production value. Filled out with astonishing visuals and no overuse of CGI, it's arguably Scott's best production: it's certainly his most ambitious. Filmed in Spain and Morocco, the makers easily whisk us back centuries to the France and Jerusalem of the time, the ability to plant us firmly in the time frame is not to be understated. Mathieson (Gladiator) is a big part of that, his colour lensing for France (metallic cold blues) and Jerusalem (dusky yellow and brown hues) is a visual treat and integral to the feel of the story. While Gregson-Williams' score rarely gets a mention, but it's very at one with Scott's vision, a delightful mix of ethnic strains, mystical flair and medieval emphasis. Scott also ups the ante for visceral battles, the horrors of war never more vivid as they are here. Supremely constructed, the siege of Jersualem is one of the finest in cinema, the first sight of fireballs igniting the night sky bringing the hairs on the back of the neck standing to attention. It's just one of many great moments that form part of Scott's breath taking epic.Badly treated on cinema release by the studio, who even marketed that cut badly, Kingdom of Heaven: Director's Cut is these days worthy of a revisit and deeper inspection. For rich rewards await the genre faithful. 9.5/10",Kingdom of Heaven
13,Theo Robertson,Sometimes Wonderful . Often Irritating,7,18 February 2008,"I'd heard a lot about KINGDOM OF HEAVEN when it was released in 2005 . Most of the reviews were rather uncomplimentary so I made a point of missing it until it was broadcast on Channel 4 last night and as I write this review I remember a lot of beautiful things about this movie . Unfortunately I can remember far more things that annoyed me Ridley Scott has been swotting up on the films and technique of David Lean and in many ways Scott is a natural successor to that legendary film director . The battle scenes are even better than the ones seen in Jackson's THE TWO TOWERS and RETURN OF THE KING and at no time did I believe I was watching an unconvincing CGI battle fest , just an army of thousands of extras walloping each other over the head like you'd see in the greatest Hollywood epics of yesteryear . Scott has also assembled a truly great cast that includes household names like Neeson and Irons alongside very effective character actors like Norton , Glen , Thewlis , Sheen and Gleeson . It must have been something of a gamble for Scott to cast pretty boy Bloom in the lead role since he's the sort of "" movie star "" who's only famous because of his good looks rather than any outstanding thespian ability but Orlando Bloom probably gives his greatest performance in this film . The only thing that the director Can be criticised for is an over reliance of slow motion during the battle scenes but apart from that everything else on screen is Oscar worthy , though since Scott was under rewarded at award ceremonies you get the feeling that he was trying a little too hard to win an Oscar There's an old saying that "" if a film is good then it's down to the director and if it's bad it's down to the screenwriter "" and this is certainly true of KINGDOM OF HEAVEN . Throughout the running time I was left scratching my head wondering about characters motives and why certain characters did certain things and let's not ignore the clichés of "" You are a brave warrior so I will let you live "" type moments . Some people claim that the studio should be held responsible rather than screenwriter William Monahan since they made several cuts to the final print and there's a disjointed feel to the narrative . Perhaps this is true but I wonder how many people watching this on DVD or on television like me had to keep logging in to the wikipedia in order to understand what was happening on screen . It should also be pointed out that there's a rather politically correct feel to the story with neither Christians or Muslims being portrayed as out and out villains with only the Knight templars being portrayed as evil . One wonders if the knight templars were still in existence today if they'd be shown in this way . In many ways it's like watching a second world war film where Germans are shown as being as much as victims of Nazism as those in the occupied territories . Honestly I was expecting the templars to goose step in to battle while proclaiming "" I vos only obeying orders "" . It says something about the quality of director and cast when they can rise above such one dimensional scripting In short this is a film that is sometimes beautiful and stunning but often irritating , confused and plodding . It is well directed and acted but you often get the impression that it tries too hard and this works against it . Historians probably won't like it and you get the feeling no one will love KINGDOM OF HEAVEN and everyone will give slightly different reasons as to why they didn't love it . In short it's a very flawed masterpiece",Kingdom of Heaven
14,LeonLouisRicci,"""There must be War. It is God's Will.""",6,3 January 2014,"Why on God's Green Earth they made a Muslim vs Christian Conflict, over the occupation of Jerusalem Story, in Today's Political Climate is a head scratcher. Add to that quandary, the Filmmakers decision to portray this Epoch in History as a sort of Fluffy and Dirty Love Story with the Prettiest of Stars making Googly eyes at each other as thousands die in the most attractive CGI ways imaginable.No one here is a Villain of any Stature. There are short Speeches about God that seem like Beer Hall Rowdiness, and some Posturing about who is the next King and so forth, but it all seems rather Shallow and Unconvincing, as does the Lead Actor that is all things at all times only because the Script says so.The Enormous Battle Scenes are the Center Point of this and while they are there for the Action/Adventure Crowd and Deliver exactly what they are supposed too, there is little else to admire. The Historical Period wears itself well on the Surface, but even the most casual of Scholars could Gripe about the actual Events and Motivations. Overall it isn't a complete Flop as Entertainment. But there is no there here and the whole thing is so Lightly handled Philosophically (Religiously), that in the End it is a very Unsatisfying Fiction that has its Heavy Pretense betrayed by an Unwillingness to say much about such an Important and Topical Subject.",Kingdom of Heaven
15,CinemaSerf,Far too bloomin' long...!,6,18 December 2019,"When I saw this in the cinema I thought it was never going to end. It pays only a passing courtesy to the history of the crusade and although a splendid example of the arts of cinematography, costume and grand battle-photography it delivers precious little by way of performance. It is clearly just a box-office driven product for Orlando Bloom. Eva Green brings some much needed style, though she hardly features and Liam Neeson as his mentor is gone from the storyline too early to rescue this ponderous epic. Sometimes the characterisations can carry an adaptation from history quite this ""creative"" but not in this instance. Sorry.",Kingdom of Heaven
16,writers_reign,A Kingdom For A Hearse,6,5 June 2005,"This gives a new meaning to the expression something for everyone; you've got Androcles And The Lion - Balian spares the life of a man he thinks is a slave and much later the man, who was, of course, a master and not a slave, returns the favour; you've got The Man In The Iron Mask via Baldwin who wears a silver mask to conceal his leprosy and then, for good measure, you've got The Alamo, with a small and heavily outnumbered band defending - what is it if not a mission - against impossible odds. Ridley Scott knows how to frame a shot and the early scenes in France work best because the landscape has more to offer, once we get to the Holy Land it's just like Robin Of Sherwood with sand. In terms of scripting it's political correctness on speed with virtually every Christian portrayed as a waste of space so that one would not have been surprised to see on the credits Written, Produced and Directed by Osama Bin Laden and it lacked only Mel-I-hate-Poms-Gibson in his best Let's Trash The English mode to round it off. The acting was competent, no more, the battle scenes were par for the course though at times it was difficult to tell who was doing what to who without a programme. On balance no better and no worse than a dozen similar movies.",Kingdom of Heaven
17,lastliberal,The Kingdom of Heaven is within you,8,26 February 2006,"Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there!for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you. Luke 17:21Leo Tolstoy used words from this passage to title his book on nonresistance: The Kingdom of God is Within You.Mahatma Gandhi wrote in his autobiography The Story of My Experiments with Truth that this book ""overwhelmed me"" and ""left an abiding impression"".It is also the central theme of the movie Kingdom of Heaven, which I finally got around to watching this weekend. Sure, I wanted to see the newest Bond girl, Eva Green, and I loved Ridley Scott's Gladiator, but I was also interested in the subject of this movie. So much so, that I am glad I got the two-disk DVD so that I could catch the commentary that appeared on the History Channel. It really added to to film to see the discussion of what was real and what was Hollywood. They really do a good job of staying close to the facts and, by the way, I think Green will make a great Bond girl.For pure action, the film matched the excitement of Gladiator, even the attack of the Muslim army under Saladin mirrored the attack of the Roman army under Maximus against the Germanic hordes. While it may not be exactly accurate, it was, nonetheless, impressive.But what really got me was the underlying message. It wasn't just the code of Knights: to protect the helpless, safeguard the peace, and work toward harmony between religions and cultures. It was also the message of Luke 17:21 and the message of Humanism: the Kingdom of God is within you - in your mind and heart. It is not a place, but an attitude that should guide your life and your relationship with others; for the Kingdom of God is within them also.Maybe that is too deep for some. OK, Just enjoy the battle, but, now that I have implanted this message in you mind, you will enjoy the movie more because you will be looking for it.",Kingdom of Heaven
18,zardoz-13,"""Kingdom of Heaven"" is far from heavenly!",4,21 June 2007,"The grisly spectacle of blood splattered medieval era warfare in ""Gladiator"" director Ridley Scott's swashbuckler ""Kingdom of Heaven"" (** out of ****) overshadows the less-than-compelling 12th century chronicle about an obscure French blacksmith who attains fame as the guardian of Jerusalem. Set during the second crusade to the Holy Land where European Christian knights have clashed with Muslims for occupation of the famous city, this lavishly-produced but tedious combat epic lacks a virile, charismatic hero, because leading man Orlando Bloom of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy projects little in the way of authority. Not only does elegant but inexpressive Bloom appear wholly miscast, but also he gives such a low-key performance that you cannot work up much enthusiasm for him when he plunges into battle. Meanwhile, newcomer Ghassan Moassoud doesn't qualify as a villain in the conventional sense of the word. As the Muslim leader of the opposing forces, he behaves more like a static figure head, giving us little to get angry about toward him. Therein lays the ambivalence of the ""Kingdom of Heaven."" The hero isn't heroic enough, and the villain isn't hateful enough. Far and away better than either Oliver Stone's disastrous ""Alexander"" or Antoine Fuqua's ""King Arthur,"" ""Kingdom of Heaven"" isn't nearly as enthralling as Wolfgang Petersen's ""Troy."" British director Ridley Scott and freshman scenarist William Monahan (also British) seem to have bitten off more than they can chew in this elaborate, serious-minded, but ironic commentary about the Middle Ages and the hypocrisy that the Church wallowed in with their crusades to occupy Jerusalem. Parallels between what occurred in the so-called Holy Lands back in the 1100s and the current unrest in Iraqi are inevitable. Interestingly, Scott and Monahan display more sympathy for the Islamic world than for the Europeans, perhaps in a gesture of political correctness to atone for the sins of Europeans and the Catholic Church. Indeed, like last year's East meets West horse opera ""Hidalgo,"" ""Kingdom of Heaven"" clearly espouses revisionist sentiments. Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Ladin might enjoy this impartial depiction of his countrymen. Imagine what might have happened in a Middle-Eastern Alamo, and you've got a fair idea what to expect from the ""Kingdom of Heaven."" In fact, ""Kingdom of Heaven"" reminded me of those westerns from the 1930s and the 1950s where a few good white man struggled to save the noble American savage from the depredations of scalp-hungry Caucasians.The sprawling saga opens in France in the year 1184 after a battle weary knight, Sir Godfrey (Liam Neeson of ""Batman Begins""), has left his knights back in Jerusalem and set out to find the son that he never knew. Godfrey's illegitimate son turns out to be a humble Gallic blacksmith, Balian (Orlando Bloom of ""Black Hawk Down""), in mourning over the death of his wife. Balian's spouse committed suicide after their first-born died. When Godfrey rides into Balian's village, the gravediggers are preparing to bury Balian's wife. A shady priest (Michael Sheen of ""Underworld"") steals the crucifix from Balian's dead wife and takes Godfrey to meet the blacksmith. Not only does Godfrey seek Balian's forgiveness for impregnating and abandoning his mother, but also he asks Balian to accompany him back to the Holy Land. Initially, Balian refuses. Later, when our hero discovers that the priest stole his dead wife's amulet, an enraged Balian slays him with a sword still glowing from the furnace. With the local authorities hot on his trail, Balian rides after Godfrey and joins him. Principally, Balian goes to Jerusalem, because Godfrey has assured him that he can obtain remission for his wife's suicide as well as his own murderous deeds. Had Scott elicited the performance from Bloom that he got from Russell Crowe in ""Gladiator,"" ""Kingdom of Heaven"" might have been more entertaining. Indeed, every shot of Bloom casts him in a heroic mould, but the young actor delivers a performance that consists more of posture than passion. Several other flaws afflict this film. First, ""Heaven"" moves at a leaden pace. The first act deals with our hero's initial encounter with the father he never knew. Liam Neeson blows everybody off the screen during his small part at the outset, while a scar-faced Jeremy Irons as the Marshal of Jerusalem towers over everybody else in the second half. Second, ""Kingdom of Heaven"" has too many characters clutter up the screen, and the story is hard to follow. Unless you're a medieval scholar, you going to have difficulty keeping track with what is going on. When Scott choreographs combat scenes, he can do no wrong. He provides us with enough geography so you don't get disoriented in all the fighting, unlike similar scenes in Oliver Stone's shoddy ""Alexander."" Clearly revisionist in sentiment, William Monahan's show-both-sides screenplay makes the Muslims more heroic than they have ever been, while it shows the Christians knights are racist, warmongering fanatics out for the spoils of war rather than the salvation of Godly deeds.Ridley Scott stages several explosive battles with such virtuosity that you may forget about the reasons for the crusade. While the battle scenes are nothing short of excellent, the climactic Moslem attack on Jerusalem suffers by comparison with a similarly staged fray from ""The Two Towers"" with its monumental onslaught against the cliff fortress at Helm's Deep. Several good actors languish in supporting roles, such as Brenda Gleeson of ""Lake Placid"" as an unrepentant scoundrel whose shaggy mane has turned blood red from all the helpless Muslims that he has slaughtered with extreme prejudice. You won't be able to recognize William Norton of ""The Score"" as a character called the King Baldwin IV who rules Jerusalem. Called the Leper King, Norton wears an ornate mask and stands between the rabid Europeans and the peaceful Muslims. Clocking in at 145 minutes (reportedly with a longer version due out on DVD at 220 minutes), the ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is far, far from heavenly.",Kingdom of Heaven
19,Boba_Fett1138,Even the battle sequences are a disappointment.,6,4 November 2005,"""Kingdom of Heaven"" is a good looking but heavily flawed movie. I never expected too much from this movie but I was disappointed in the fact that it even failed in creating memorable and impressive battle sequences. From a movie like this and certainly from a director like Ridley Scott you may and should expect some good looking massive battle sequences. Yes, there were massive battle sequences in the movie but it was all way too short to make a lasting impression. Main problem with the movie is the storytelling. The movie never really seems to find a right pace. Just when you think you're finally going to see some action the action is cut of already. Such as when Balian and friends rides off to stall some time. Just when the action has begun the movie cuts to the ending of the battle. Or when Guy de Lusignan and Reynald battle the Saracens in the desert. That battle isn't even shown! Not one second of it...Also during the siege of Jerusalam the movie cuts off multiple times just when the action takes pace and becomes interesting. It was an huge let down. But of course there is more to a movie than just action, so how about the other elements of the movie? Well, the story itself is also too uninteresting. There isn't really a clear plot-line for most of the time and it is unclear were the movie is heading to, especially in the first halve of the movie. Not everything in the movie feels connected with each other, or really flows well. Many characters are introduced in the movie but almost none of them is ever really used. As a result we get to see a movie about some two-dimensional characters that we never really get to know or care about. Because of this the battle sequences also never got tense, why should we care if anyone of them dies? Also none of the characters seemed to be afraid to die and everyone seemed to be thrilled and glad that there was a war going on. The movie also tries hard to be political correct towards all parties involved. Many people find this disturbing and annoying but in this case I never really had any problems with it during the movie. I also had no problems with the historical inaccuracies. I look at this movie as entertainment not as a documentary.Visually there is nothing wrong with the movie. The camera-work by John Mathieson is good and there are some impressive looking landscape's, sets and costumes. The battle sequences and mass scene's are good looking and the movie has some impressive special effects but it's too short all to make those moments memorable. The movie also shows that Ridley Scott is of course still a great director and almost every scene is a real beauty to look at. It really is the story and pace that kills this movie. It's not Scott's fault, he was given simply too much story material to work with, to make it all fit in a two and an halve hour movie. Because of this there are many moments in the movie that feel 'incomplete'.Also the casting is quite weak. Strangely I'm not revering to Orlando Bloom. Lot's of people felt that he wasn't ready yet- or believable as the main 'hero'. I had no problems with him and I actually thought that he was pretty good as the main character. I had far more problems with the other typecasting of the movie. It was distracting to see Brendan Gleeson from ""Braveheart"", Marton Csokas from the Lord of the Rings trilogy and David Thewlis from ""Dragonheart"" in the movie. They are all actors who already played memorable parts in movies from the same genre. Liam Neeson was good as always but underused in this movie. The movie could had really used him as an actor and character at times. Simply fantastic was Jeremy Irons but also he had unfortunately a quite small role. It was almost like as if the best actors were given the smallest and least interesting roles of the movie. This also implies for Edward Norton who played King Baldwin.Of course by no means an 'horrible' movie but it simply is too forgettable all, mainly due to the storytelling, to really recommend it to everyone.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Kingdom of Heaven

If you're looking for a review that evaluates the historical, religious and so on and so forth, aspects, I'd advise reading someone else's(but hey, if you want, by all means, stick around... I've got a deck of cards around here somewhere). The plot isn't bad. The acting is very good, with both powerful and underplayed performances herein. The action is very, very cool, immensely intense(even if there are points where it's... kind of obvious that it's staged) and with good use of time and camera work. This is quite epic at parts. The music is great, a grand score. The choreography is commendable. The cinematography and editing are both impressive. There is a considerable amount of violence in this. Effects are nicely done(apart from those things I alluded to in the...other parenthesis). This should most definitely not be watched by children... and it may very well offend some adults. Casting was done well. I recommend this to those interested in the story and the period, and while there is a reasonable amount of it, those looking more for fight scenes and such may want to look elsewhere... from the Trivia, I gather that this was not meant to be that. 7/10",Kingdom of Heaven

Ridley Scott's epic yet logy take on the Crusades has moments of true majesty in his tale of a blacksmith (Bloom doing the best he can with his weighty role) who reunites with his abandoned father, a knight (Neeson), who enlists him into battle for Christianity as the Muslim hordes threaten to reclaim their homeland in the eye of the storm of Biblical Jerusalem. In spite of the impeccable production design by Arthur Max, colorful costumes and art direction by, respectively, Janty Yates; Maria-Teresa Barbasso and Gianni Giovagnoni (with Robert Cowper, John King and Marco Trentini) ; the ethereal musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams and Stephen Barton; and John Mathieson's skillful cinematography, screenwriter William Monahan (his big screen debut) doesn't know how to trim the fat and goes in circles with the timely theme of the seemingly impossible quest for peace in the Middle East and the ramifications by those who should know better.

22,view_and_review,Kingdom of Heaven and land of war,8,20 March 2007,"I read somewhere that when the movie was previewed there were complaints from Christians and Muslims... that's when the director said he knew the film was perfect. This movie was good in spite of Orlando Bloom (sorry I had to throw in that shot at Bloom, I am not impressed by that guy). How historically accurate it is? I'm not exactly sure, but I have heard of Salahudeen and his reign in Israel.This movie details some of the early encounters of Muslims and Christians over Jerusalem. More than anything, it lets a lot of people know that Israel and Jerusalem have been fought over for years, long before this fifty plus year old feud between Palestinians and Jews. It is sad that a land that holds so much religious value to so many people cannot be more peaceful.As the case with all movies about battle, many lives were lost on both sides. This movie had honor, treachery, deceit, and loyalty; the very characteristics that are needed to fabricate a war. Still the movie was well done and it holds its appeal due to its link with history.",Kingdom of Heaven
23,Uriah43,The Battle to Retake Jerusalem,7,5 April 2017,"This movie begins in 1184 with a knight named ""Godfrey de Ibelin"" (Liam Neeson) returning to France from the Middle East in search of a son he never got the chance to know. At that exact same time a young blacksmith by the name of ""Balian"" (Orlando Bloom) has just lost his wife due to her suicide over the loss of her new baby. Although Balian has no real interest in forming a relationship with his newly declared father, that changes when he subsequently kills a corrupt priest for stealing his dead wife's crucifix. With nowhere else to go he proceeds to join the Crusaders on their way back to the Holy Land where he hopes he can attain forgiveness for his wife and himself. Unfortunately, the Crusaders are soon met by some local knights intent on bringing Balian back and punishing him for his crime. A fight breaks out between the two groups and even though the local knights are defeated Godfrey is severely injured and dies not long afterward. However, before passing away he bequeaths his title to his son and makes him swear to support the King of Jerusalem against his enemies--which includes a large faction of Knights Templars led by a man named ""Guy de Lisignan"" (Marton Csokas) who is spoiling for a fight against the Muslims even though the Crusaders are greatly outnumbered. Along with that, Guy is betrothed to a beautiful woman named ""Sibylla"" (Eva Green) who is immediately attracted to Balian--and she prefers him to Guy. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a very entertaining film which kept my attention throughout. Historically, the Crusaders who had been in the Holy Land the longest realized that they were greatly outnumbered and preferred to keep possession of Jerusalem and other key areas by peacefully coexisting with the Muslim population when possible. On the other hand, those Crusaders who were relatively new to the area were more intolerant and sought battle for both religious and economic reasons. As such, this film captures that dynamic remarkably well. On the other hand, there were also some touches of ""Hollywood"" included which I thought were totally unnecessary--but I suppose that is to be expected from any big-budget project like this. In any case, I liked this movie and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",Kingdom of Heaven
24,ferguson-6,Religion is not always next to Godliness,7,23 May 2005,"Greetings again from the darkness. This one turned out much better than expected. Thought hit and miss director Ridley Scott was just anxious to recapture glory of ""Gladiator"" and it might be little more than a CG show. In fact, ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is at times an artsy history film encouraging the viewer to analyze the ironic nature of religion as it plays into power and politics. Orlando Bloom (""Pirates of the Caribbean"" ""Troy"") is actually very good as the soft spoken blacksmith-turned Crusade leader. Guessing it took Bloom about an hour to learn his lines, but he proves effective in communicating his thoughts. Strong support from vets such as Liam Neesom and Jeremy Irons and in a very interesting turn as the leper-King, Ed Norton emotes through a mask. The always colorful David Thewlis is terrific in his part and numerous other supporting cast members pull off the battle of the religions pretty well. The costumes are outstanding and the battle scenes are pretty well staged. Slightly better pacing could have nudged this rating up a notch, but I think the film suffers from the glut of similar type pictures lately - ""Troy"" and ""Alexander"" among them. Overall decent film that is fun to watch.",Kingdom of Heaven
25,anaconda-40658,Nothing Heavenly Here.,4,9 June 2015,"Kingdom of Heaven (2005): Dir: Ridley Scott / Cast: Orlando Bloom, Eva Green, Liam Neeson, Jeremy Irons, David Thewlis: In the same vein as Troy, Alexander and the overrated Gladiator and every bit as a showcase of production over story. Orlando Bloom plays a blacksmith who had just lost his wife to suicide after the loss of their child now he is invited by his father to journey to Jerusalem where he hopes to obtain forgiveness. This is not exactly what the Bible teaches on the matter but Bloom becomes a crusader and many battles are fought. While Ridley Scott presents triumphant battles on the highest scale, this isn't the classic craft as seen in his Blade Runner or Alien. Bloom is engaging and much more sympathetic than he was in Troy. Eva Green as a humble Princess is a too good to be true gem who never seems believable. Liam Neeson opens the film as Bloom's father who is placed in an unfortunate position that results in heavy consequence. Jeremy Irons as a fellow crusader should have been broader. It assembles a capable cast and a director of great prospect but the result is only a visually well presented war. The ambition is here but the payoff isn't quite golden with its need for exploited violence and showy visuals. Fantastic sets and exquisite camera work result in an epic that doesn't quite grasp Christian forgiveness but it does understand the need. Score: 4 / 10",Kingdom of Heaven
26,Aaron1375,A very good epic adventure starring the guy who makes only epic adventures it seems.,9,19 May 2005,"Yes, again we have Orlando Bloom in a larger than life period piece where there are sword fights and really cool battle scenes. The guy has a knack for turning up in movies I enjoy watching and this movie is no exception to the rule. Here he plays a blacksmith who is at a very bad time in his life at the moment, his wife and child are dead. If this isn't enough, the father he has never known has come to ask him to join him in his crusade to Jeruseulem. He turns them down, but does something that causes a loss of faith and a need for redemption so he rushes to once again meet up with his father who turns out to be a very good and noble man with the best of intentions and the brief time they have together really makes an impression on the young blacksmith. Then through a series of events that finds our hero the lone survivor of a ship heading for Jeruseulem he makes his way to the fabled town showing a penchant for being a decent man with one sin he must erase. He becomes leader of a small village for which he helps to make better and a knight that is willing to protect those not really worthy of protection. In the end, we have him protecting the people against an army that is waging war based on the despicable actions of men who came to power by means that are less than honorable. A very good movie all the way around, good acting especially by Bloom and Liam Neeson and very good action. Probably came out the wrong time though as recently the theaters have seen a lot of these movies come and go which is a shame because this one really is one of the better ones that isn't a Lord of the Ring movie. I highly recommend it.",Kingdom of Heaven
27,Wuchakk,"Good start and ending, weak middle, but magnificent photography and haunting score",6,27 November 2012,"""Kingdom of Heaven"" (2005) isn't as good as contemporaneous sword & sandal flicks ""Troy"" (one of my favorites) and ""King Arthur"" (very good), but it's not bad either.THE PLOT: After the death of his child and suicide of his wife, Balian (Orlando Bloom) meets his long, lost father (Liam Neeson) who encourages him to go to Jerusalem and start a new life. After a long eventful trip, Balian arrives in Jerusalem and is introduced to Princess Sibylla (Eva Green), the leprous King Baldwin and other VIPs. The political maneuverings of these key personnel is mindboggling (I suggest using the subtitles to keep track of who's who) but, when all is said and done, Balian must rise to the challenge of defending the city against Saladin (Ghassan Massoud) and his great Muslim army.Like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962), ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is a film that can be enjoyed just for the visuals and soundtrack. The film was shot in Morocco where a vast replica of ancient Jerusalem was built in the desert with the backgrounds enhanced by CGI effects, and so on.Story-wise, the beginning and ending are strong while the convoluted soap operatics of Jerusalem aren't very compelling, but Eva Green's awesome eyes help.I'm no connoisseur of the crusades but I realize the filmmakers put a modern spin on the events and ideology of the characters. So what else is new? In any case, I was impressed that all the main players are based on real-life people and that the gist of the story is accurate.The Theatrical Cut runs 144 minutes and the Director's Cut about 48 minutes longer. The DC is heralded as one of the best DCs ever, like ""Daredevil"" (2003).BOTTOM LINE: ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is worth it just for the magnificent visuals and soundtrack. The story starts strong and ends strong while the dramatics of the lengthy mid-section are complicated and not very compelling. But story drive and interesting characters were never director Ridley Scott's strong suit. Nevertheless, Orlando Bloom is likable as the protagonist and Massoud makes for a striking Saladin, who doesn't appear till the halfway point.GRADE: C+/B-",Kingdom of Heaven
28,gradyharp,An Epic Film with a Heart,8,15 October 2005,"KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is not just another Hollywood epic with a cast of thousands laying pillage to the earth and fellow man. Yes, it is a mammoth production with enough spectacular sets, battle scenes, violence and atmosphere to satisfy even the most ravenous Big Picture appetite. But is also has a fine script (written by William Monahan) that elects to focus on a rather intimate series of stories that have sensitivity and tenderness and, perhaps more importantly, offers some historical background for understanding the ongoing battles over the city of Jerusalem.Balian (Orlando Bloom) is a recently widowed blacksmith in France in the 12th century whose long absent nobleman father Godfrey surprisingly informs him that Balian is his son and pleads with him to accompany him to Jerusalem for the Crusades, a challenge Balian slowly accepts. Godfrey is killed in battle but manages to bestow his knighthood on Balian before he dies, leaving Balian to assume the important role of humanist in the multifaceted struggle for power that exists in Jerusalem. King Baldwin of Jerusalem (Edward Norton) lives a holy life hiding his leprosy behind a mask and bids Balian to protect the people of the city of Jerusalem against not only the evil undermining of the Knights Templar led by Reynald (Brendan Gleeson) and the incipient King of Jerusalem Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas), but also against the Saracens led by Saladin (Ghassan Massoud). Balian is assisted by mentor Tiberias (Jeremy Irons) and by his innocent love for Sybilla (Eva Green) who unfortunately is the wife of Guy! Balian remains true to his ideals of knighthood.The military logistics of the various battles are a bit confusing to follow as the variation in uniforms is minimal. But it is Balian's ever-present protection of the people of Jerusalem that leads to the historical moment that ends the siege of the city well described in history books. The film ends in a manner that emphasizes the importance of humanity over greed, lust, war, and destruction and opens the path for compassion for the centuries long schism that still afflicts the holy city.The cast is excellent with small roles made large by such fine actors as Michael Sheen, David Thwelis, Velibor Topic, among others. The musical score is a magnificent blend of Western ecclesiastic themes (including Bach!) with Eastern ones under the writing direction of Harry Gregson-Williams. John Mathieson is responsible for the vivid cinematography. But major kudos go to Ridley Scott for making what could have been a loud blood and guts period piece into a film with a quiet heart and soul. KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is an inspiring film to see.

29,The_Void,Kingdom of Tedium,2,2 August 2005,"One of the current trends in cinema is 'historical epics'. Thanks largely to Lord of the Rings, these sorts of films have been sweeping the cinemas recently, and I have successfully managed to avoid all of them. Kingdom of Heaven stood out as being one that might not be rubbish, however, but unfortunately; it turned out to be just that. The film has come under scrutiny since release for the way that it portrays hatred between different religious sectors; but I don't see that as a criticism of the film that holds weight. Maybe the film does portrays Muslims in a negative light; but it doesn't matter, because there is nothing about this film that warrants it being regarded as anything but a load of rubbish anyway. The film's main problem is it's narrative. It's confusing to say the least, and since the film is long and drawn out; it doesn't exactly help if we add 'boring' to the equation. It's a shame because the crusades could have given a nice base for a movie; certainly a movie much better than this dull tedium.The muddled plot follows a blacksmith called Balian who follows his father, a seasoned knight, to a legendary 'Holy City'. The action is very melodramatic and 'searing' throughout, and after about five minutes; it gets very tedious indeed. Not even the large scale fighting sequences can save this film, as they're filmed in a way that isn't much less boring than the rest of the film. All this wouldn't be quite so bad, however, if it wasn't for a certain cast member. There's nobody more annoying than Orlando Bloom at the minute and the fact that, like his fellow talentless Lord of the Rings star; Elijah Wood, he keeps getting lead roles at the moment only makes him more irritating. Bloom basically just 'appears' in this film and gives neither a lasting impression, nor any whisper of a good performance. Liam Neeson gives the only performance worth remembering, and he plays the same character he plays in Batman Begins. I'm rather surprised at Ridley Scott for this film. Historical epics have already slayed fellow competent director Oliver Stone with the critically lambasted 'Alexander', and now Sir Scott has fallen into the same trap. Oh well...avoid this rubbish. Unless you really like dull epics, of course.",Kingdom of Heaven
30,zetes,Weak Crusades epic by Ridley Scott,4,16 May 2005,"Scott has an undeserved reputation, mostly based on just a couple of movies (Alien and Blade Runner), and it doesn't surprise me that this movie is so unimpressive. It makes Gladiator, a decent film, look like it deserved to win the Best Picture Oscar. Orlando Bloom stars. A lot of negative stuff has been said about him, but, truth be told, I don't think he's that bad an actor. He's a perfect matinée idol, and Pirates of the Caribbean suits him well. He's poor in Kingdom of Heaven, but I wouldn't blame him. His role is underwritten. His character, Balian, is a French blacksmith who discovers that he is the illegitimate son of a great warrior. He then travels to Jerusalem, where Christians have held fort for the past century. Through dirty dealings on the Christians' side, the Muslims, lead by Saladin, attempt to take Jerusalem back. There is little that is worthwhile. The battle scenes have all been done better in other movies. I guess after Return of the King, nothing much is going to compare. The references to modern politics are sparse and very poorly integrated. Troy did this much better last year. It criticizes hardcore Christianity to some extent, but really these are only petty barbs. The attitudes of the characters feel completely anachronistic. Besides a couple of scummy priests, religion is barely present. Morality is completely modernized. The only reason I had interest in seeing this movie was because it is Eva Green's second role. Her first was in Bertolucci's The Dreamers. Her screen presence is hard to argue with, but I think she is a gifted young actress and I hope she will go onto better things. She is completely wasted in Kingdom of Heaven.",Kingdom of Heaven

I wonder how accurate the story is with real life? There were less battle scenes in this movie and the trailer is misleading with this aspect. The king Henry is great with the ending. Many people have a feeling for a need for purpose in life, and the film gives a reason for events and wars. K of H is a 6 out of 10 movie. Forgotten with time, like historical events. A movie rental.

The costumes are beautiful, from intricately remade Knights armour, to the desert garb of the Muslim warriors. The soundtrack is a mixture of sounds with middle eastern influences, but somehow pales in comparison with Gladiator and lacks a central theme.Much is said about how the film portrays religion, given the sensitive subject of the Crusades, but I feel that Ridley has achieved a wonderful balance between how Christianity and Islam are portrayed. Both are given fair airtime on their ideologies, and the film tries to preach (pardon the pun) about tolerance, yet highlights the dangers of fanatical followers of both religions, of misguidance from men in search of worldly power.Which Christianity took a beating - where senseless battles are waged in the name of Christ, where insensitivity breed contempt. Preists are cast in negative light and given lines like ""convert to Islam, repent later"" when all around seems lost. It is emphasized in the show that what matters is in your head and in your heart - that noble actions speak louder than mere empty and repetitive ""praise the Lord"" chants, as if that will protect you during Judgement Day.Orlando Bloom plays Balian, a blacksmith who became a fugitive, but inherited land and army from his father, Godfrey, played by Liam Neeson. The film can be broadly categorized into 3 acts - the first in which Balian searches for his identity and new life in Jerusalem, the second in which the focus is on religion and politics of the time, and the last, the spectacular siege and war.Bloom puts up a commendable performance, so to his detractors out there, you're in for a big surprise. Edward Norton had the difficult task of acting through a mask as leper King Baldwin, and I applaud Ridley's decision of casting real Muslim actors to learn from them.Fans of Eva Green might be disappointed that the relationship between Balian and Queen Sibylla was played down to focus on the battles, but I feel it's a fair trade off.Firstly, some of you might not like the quick-cut-MTV style editing in Gladiator's fight scenes, especially the close ups. This is repeated here though, in a blood splattering manner. The pan-out and general landscape sweeps are mindblowing, and will leave you wanting more. Think about the battles that you see Lord of The Rings Two Towers and Return of the King - the siege on Helm's Deep and Minas Tirith - Kingdom of Heaven delivers the equivalent, probably even better (without the fantasy elements). This is one medieval war movie whose battles will stick in your mind for some time.The audience were the only disappointing experience for me - they were laughing at a dialogue near the end, where a ""knight"" asked who Balian was, and he answered ""I'm the blacksmith"", in which the ""knight"" answered ""I'm the King"". Laughter was abound in the theatre. I was like, HELL-O people! See that lion motif on his armour? That's Richard the Lionheart! D'uh! The Crusades didn't end there, it waged on...What is Jerusalem worth? Nothing, everything. Watch this, and in my opinion, it has Oscar written all over it. Now to hit the library and research more on the subject!",Kingdom of Heaven
33,JamesHitchcock,The Best Lack All Conviction,7,10 June 2005,"With ""Kingdom of Heaven"", Ridley Scott continues the modern revival of the large-scale epic which he himself began a few years ago with ""Gladiator"". Orlando Bloom, who had supporting roles in ""Lord of the Rings "" and ""Troy"", finally gets to take the starring role in a film of this type. The film is set in the late twelfth century during the era of the Crusades. Bloom plays Balian, a blacksmith from a small French village, who has recently been widowed by the suicide of his wife following the death of their child. Shortly afterwards, he discovers that he is the illegitimate son of a powerful nobleman with lands in the Christian kingdom of Jerusalem. His father urges him to travel with him to the Middle East. Balian initially refuses, but is later forced to flee after killing a priest who mocked him over his wife's death. Upon arrival in Jerusalem Balian, now legitimised and a lord in his own right, discovers that the kingdom is in turmoil, with two opposing factions contending for power. The ruling faction, led by King Baldwin IV and his lieutenant Tiberias and which Balian supports, favours a policy of peaceful coexistence with the neighbouring Muslim states. This policy is opposed by many, particularly the powerful and warlike Order of the Templars (presented as a mediaeval Christian equivalent of Al-Qaeda) and a group of nobles who will take any opportunity to try to provoke violence against the Muslims. Baldwin is dying of leprosy and on his death the crown passes to his brother-in-law Guy de Lusignan, one of the leaders of the ""war party"". Guy provokes a disastrous war against the Muslim leader Saladin, and after he is captured in battle it is left to Balian and a small group of followers to defend Jerusalem against the victorious Muslim army. At the centre of the film is the tragic, or potentially tragic, dilemma confronting Balian. He is the lover of the Princess Sibylla, Baldwin's sister and the estranged wife of Guy de Lusignan. The King sees in this relationship a chance to ensure that power remains in moderate hands. He offers to have Guy put to death, which will mean that Balian will be free to marry Sibylla and, as her husband, will be able to claim the throne after Baldwin's death. Balian, however, refuses this offer. Although he hates and despises Guy, he still feels guilt over the killing of the priest and does not want another death on his conscience. Visually, this is a handsome film, set against some starkly beautiful desert scenery in Spain and Morocco, and one which captures the atmosphere of the Middle Ages. The recreation of the city of Jerusalem is particularly impressive. Orlando Bloom plays his part well, although he lacks the commanding presence that Russell Crowe brought to ""Gladiator"", and there are also good performances from Jeremy Irons as Tiberias, from Ghassan Massoud as Saladin and from Edward Norton as Baldwin. This last must have been a difficult part to play, as the King wears a mask at all times to hide the disfigurement caused by his illness, which meant that Norton could not convey emotion or character through facial expressions and had to reply on voice and gestures alone. I did not, however, enjoy the film as much as ""Gladiator"" or ""Troy"". The reason is that it lacks the dramatic tension that underlay those films. By this I do not mean that it lacks stirring action sequences- there are plenty of those, particularly towards the end when the Muslims lay siege to the city. I mean that there is not the same sense of emotional drama. At the centre of ""Gladiator"" was the conflict between the politically powerful Emperor Commodus, cruel but basically weak and insecure, and Maximus, politically impotent but possessed of indomitable courage and desire to seek justice for his murdered family. At the centre of ""Troy"" was the relationships between the ruthless Agamemnon, the selfless patriot Hector and the more ambiguous figure of Achilles. The conflicts in ""Kingdom of Heaven"" do not have the same emotional power. The villains are not the Muslims; it is made clear that the Christians bear the responsibility for the outbreak of war, and Saladin has good qualities that his enemies lack. The villains are rather the Christian fanatics who deliberately try to provoke conflict. The leaders of the war party, Guy and his ally Reynald de Chastillon do not, however, emerge as fully developed characters in the way that the leaders of the peace party do. The peace party, moreover, are weak and ineffective. King Baldwin is dying, and has an air of ""après moi le deluge"" about him. Tiberias is world-weary and disillusioned. Balian is too guilt-ridden to take any action to prevent the coming catastrophe, and only becomes an effective leader when it is too late. They called to mind Yeats's lines from ""The Second Coming"": ""The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity"". The result is a film that, for all its visual attractiveness, is gloomy and pessimistic in tone. 7/10",Kingdom of Heaven
34,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Wait, it gets better",9,18 October 2005,"My free rental from Blockbuster, it has to be a good movie, right? The first time I started watching this, I fell asleep. The beginning is very slow paced and you're just kind of wondering what the point is of the film. When I sat down to it again, hoping maybe I was just in a bad mood, it got a lot better towards the middle and ended brilliantly. Kingdom of Heaven was a great movie, even though I felt that it was a little dragged out in some moments. The look and feel of the film makes you feel as if you were there. The actors: they were real, they very much got into their roles you could tell. Even though I felt that Orlando is too much of a pretty boy, you have to admit the guy can act. I feel bad though, because of his looks or press, he might get snubbed by the Oscars, in example: Brad Pitt, Johnny Depp, and Leonardo DiCaprio.Go watch Kingdom of Heaven, trust me, it's worth the watch. Especially with the disappointments of recent war films like Troy and Alexander. No offense to those who enjoyed those films. Like I said, it's a bit of a wait and a little dragged out for my tastes, but it's a decent flick for a night.9/10",Kingdom of Heaven
35,Rainey-Dawn,Bored Me,2,18 March 2021,"I'm sorry but this film bored me to tears, I don't know what I expected but it wasn't this. I realize lots of others enjoyed this movie but it could not capture me.I don't know - I may give this one another chance but on first watch it's a no go.2/10",Kingdom of Heaven
36,disdressed12,"great movie,poor casting choice in lead role",9,14 January 2007,"Kingdom of Heaven is another Ridley Scott epic,set during the time of the Crusades in the 12th century,a time of war between the Christians and the Muslims.Orlando Bloom plays Balian,a humble blacksmith who ends up traveling to Jeruselum and(inadvertently) becomes defender of the city and its people.I really enjoyed this film.Scott shows again why he is so sought after as a director.the film contains epic battle scenes,is beautifully photographed and very well paced.there only a few minor problems with the film.one is the fact that a humble blacksmith with little if any training would become skilled warrior in the very limited time shown in the film.also the fact that this same man would then become leader of a nation.that seems a bit beyond the realm of plausibility.and the casting of Orlando bloom is really weak.He is not someone who would inspire confidence,mainly because he is too young and lacks the maturity for the role.the rest of the film is well done,very entertaining.again,it may not be historically accurate,but so what.you want historical accuracy,watch the History channel.you want an entertaining piece of cinema,watch this movie.normally a movie this well made would rate a perfect 10,but due to the poor casting of Orlando Bloom,Kingdom of Heaven gets a 9/10",Kingdom of Heaven
37,sddavis63,A Long And Dreadful Yawn,2,11 January 2008,"I'm somewhat familiar with the history of the Crusades, and thought that this movie - even though it's largely fictional - would be an interesting one to watch as a result. Instead, what I found was a movie very heavy on violence and blood, which is OK if it serves to move forward a good story, but in this case the blood and violence was paired with a largely incoherent storyline that didn't make a great deal of sense to me. Clearly, we are meant to follow Balian's (Orlando Bloom) journey, which begins with his wife committing suicide after the death of their child, for which she is declared to be consigned to hell as a result by the parish priest, and which ends with him as the defender of the people of Jerusalem during a Crusade. Along the way he seems to come to an understanding of God (or with God?) in defiance of what the priests tell him about God. That's fine. It just seemed to take forever to get there. There also seemed to me to be an unacknowledged political commentary going on here. We live in an age when the big fear is about Muslim extremists being moved to violence. The movie makes the point that Christians are just as susceptible to extremism and violence (witness the priest - I guess that's what he was - crying out ""killing an infidel isn't murder, it's a ticket to heaven!"") Point taken, but still, the overall story was to me not only largely incoherent but just plain uninteresting. It gains a bit thanks to a very realistic re-creation of 12th century Jerusalem, but still, for me it's only a 2/10",Kingdom of Heaven
38,Buddy-51,a cut above the ordinary,7,31 May 2006,"In addition to its wide-ranging battle scenes and handsome production values, Ridley Scott's Medieval epic ""Kingdom of Heaven"" boasts a greater complexity of character and depth of theme than we are accustomed to finding in a film of this type. Although set in the late 12th Century, the film has a great deal of relevance to the world of today, seeing as how the Christian West and the Muslim East are once again at each others' throats much as they were back then. Only the names and the weaponry seem to have changed. With an eye towards fairness, perhaps, the movie makes it very clear that there are men of war and men of peace on both sides of the conflict, although, if the truth be told, the Christians come out slightly less noble than their Islamic counterparts in the film.By the time the story begins, the Crusades have been waging on and off for nearly a hundred years already. And although a fragile peace seems to have taken a temporary hold in the Christian-ruled city of Jerusalem, forces from both without and within are threatening to rend the tender garment holding that peace together. Orlando Bloom plays the young blacksmith, Balian, son of the beloved Sir Godfrey (Liam Nissan), who is hoping to find his redemption for killing a priest by becoming a knight and dedicating his life to defending that holiest of cities to the best of his abilities.Beyond its rather excessive running time, the biggest weakness in the film is Bloom himself who makes for a very bland, very pallid central figure, one whose ""romance"" with Sibylla, the queen of Jerusalem, is the least interesting aspect of the film. However, there are fine compensatory supporting performances by Liam Nissan, Jeremy Irons and Ghassan Massoud as the great Islamic leader, Saladin, who, like Balian, is portrayed as almost a reluctant warrior in this titanic struggle for religious domination.And indeed, it is the sociopolitical parallels that the film draws between its own time and ours that ultimately lifts ""Kingdom of Heaven"" a rung or two above the ordinary.",Kingdom of Heaven
39,Robert_duder,Kingdom stumbles over itself but its beauty and elegeance win out,7,23 February 2008,"Kingdom of Heaven seems like the perfect recipe for a historical epic drama/action. Director Ridley Scott is a master director to say the least...and his story telling is legendary and we know he can helm a historical epic because Gladiator was downright brilliant. There is no doubt that his story telling and direction comes through in the battle scenes, and the epic setting of the film but somehow the complex story gets buried and muddled. The story has potential somewhere beneath all of that muddled crap but unfortunately it never clears itself up enough to become truly incredible. But fortunately Scott's direction wins over with incredible battle scenes, a setting rich in history and truly remarkably choreographed fighting. The battle at the end of the film is something worthy of just watching on its own. It's truly stunning. I have no doubt that some sort of CGI played a part in the film but you'd never know it because everything does look meticulously recreated and done. Filmed throughout Spain, it made an incredible setting for what is actually the Arabian desert surrounding Jerusalem.Hollywood favorite Orlando Bloom, fresh from other historical epics like Troy, and of course, The Lord of The Rings trilogy, and Pirates of the Caribbean keeps his costume on and plays a blacksmith who is inadvertently brought into the crusades after murdering a crooked priest and ends up becoming a past day Lawrence of Arabia by rallying the Christians and saving lives, thus fulfilling his destiny. Sounds interesting doesn't it? Problem is Bloom is very monotoned and simple and it's just not believable that for no other reason than he's there he becomes a hero to these people. He doesn't carry the film very well and it's part of the reason it lacks in power and a punch. Someone else needs to take the reigns from him. He is a good actor but I'm not sure he's a great actor. Liam Neeson plays a small cameo role but very good as Bloom's estranged father who manages to teach him everything he knows to go on and become the master fighter and leader he becomes. Neeson is really good, and a welcome asset but doesn't last long enough to make a real impact. Syrian actor Ghassan Massoud who worked with Bloom on Pirates of the Caribbean, is excellent, maybe one of the high points of this film as Muslim King Saladin. He is a true King, and just really shows power and wealth and yet diplomacy and honor and despite technically being the 'villain' he isn't really. They are both fighting for what they believe in. I found Eva Green who plays the Queen for the Christian side almost ludicrous as she somehow loses her mind throughout the film pulling a Britney Spears impersonation and her and Bloom have little chemistry both being very withdrawn in their performances. The supporting cast could have been very worthy including Jeremy Irons, Brendan Gleeson, and Marton Csokas, but they aren't given a lot to work with.The problem with the film is the character development is virtually nil. The film relies entirely on its battle scenes which are terrific but to make a truly great film you need deep character development and not just the battle and blood and guts. Gladiator, and Braveheart are perfect examples of epic battle and story but with incredible character development. In Kingdom of Heaven you're following an entire adventure of this character portrayed by Bloom but you don't care at all ever. And when he finally makes his epic speech it's almost shocking because he hasn't done anything that outstanding in the whole film but it doesn't move you because of that reason. Still Kingdom of Heaven will be mostly enjoyed in small doses by Orlando Bloom fans and even history fans of historical epics. It's not awful, it's just certainly not as good as it could have been nor does it live up to being an 'epic' in the Hollywood sense of the word. 7/10",Kingdom of Heaven
40,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Whereas Gladiator managed to be a thrilling epic, this just feels, for the most part, like a long slog to the end",4,23 May 2005,"STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs In 14th Century England, Balain (Orlando Bloom) a humble blacksmith, is in mourning following the tragic death of his wife and two children. Then he is suddenly approached by the warrior Godfrey of Ibelin (Liam Neeson) in these tragic times, who reveals himself to be his father and offers him the chance to start a new life in a far-away land. At first hesitant, Balain soon changes his mind when he kills a priest following a shattering revelation. Travelling far away to the Holy Land, Balain discovers a war in progress between King Baldwin IV (Edward Norton) and King Saladin (Ghassan Massoud.) Ridley Scott directing another historical epic. Orlando Bloom starring in another historical epic. What great timing. Sadly, Kingdom of Heaven manages to be neither Gladiator or Troy.In Troy, Bloom had only a supporting role. Here he takes the lead, and in doing so reveals to his audience that, despite his enthusiasm, he still has a bit of a way to go before he makes that grade to true leading man material. In the supporting roles, Neeson is adequate but doesn't manage to be especially memorable and Jeremy Irons, popping up as King's adviser Tiberias, doesn't seem to have abandoned his over-acting streak. Only Norton (as usual), face concealed by a grey mask through-out the film, manages to shine as the King.Directing, Scott, as we know, has been capable of great things lately (well, comparatively lately) such as Gladiator but lets not forget he can produce mind-numbing tripe too (remember Hannibal.) Here he's made a film that sort of falls in-between. It's not completely bad, well-written in parts and with some good battle scenes, but far too many where the warring parties just unsatisfactorily talk their way out of it. That might be the way to go in real life, but up on the big screen , I want to see battles and blood-shed. That's a big part of this movie's problem: it just feels too boring. It seems to go on forever, and I was starting to feel it's strain by the end.In the end, the film seems to be trying to stab at some symbolism at the way we are today, still killing over religion and missing the big ideal of the 'Kingdom of Heaven.' This is very admirable, but I just wish the film had been a bit more fulfilling as a whole so I could have absorbed it more. **",Kingdom of Heaven
41,paul2001sw-1,Banal and bombastic,5,24 February 2008,"One thousand years after 'Gladiator', director Ridely Scott stages another historical epic; but whereas I quite liked his film about Rome, this one (set in Jerusalem) did not appeal. The movie is simply too ""Hollywood"" at every level. Thus we have a hero who is not only handsome, but brave, of good judgement, undesiring of rank (but still a leader), always willing to work with his men, who aspires to nothing less than a ""kingdom of conscience"" and who displays an unhistorical humanism to boot. Phew! We also have a script full of portentious lines that the cast seems to have (Jeremy Irons excepted) no idea of how to deliver; pretty boy Orlando Bloom appears out of his depth in the lead, mumbling his way through dialogue that makes no sense treated as naturalistic. The script is also rather heavy-handed; for example, when the Saracen Saladin first appears, there is a cut to a character (the beautiful Eva Green) muttering ""Saladdin!"" under her breath, just to make sure that we understand; and the score flags every emotion both crudely and sanctimoniously. Finally, the move looks great, but so heavy is its reliance on special effects, and in particular on computer-enhanced landscapes, that for much of the time it feels as if one is watching a cross-between 'The Lord of the Rings' and the desert scenes in 'Star Wars' (with Liam Neeson reprising his role from 'The Phantom Menace' to boot); although even 'Star Wars' came closer to offering us heroes with flaws than this film does. Somehow I can't wholly believe in the spectacular world on display here, for all the amazing visual tricks there's still a line between the real world and its faked counterpart, and sadly too much of this movie takes place on the wrong side. And I also can't help but feel that the often-mocked historical epics of the 1960s were actually better than their modern counterparts; part of what gives an epic its quality is its sprawling nature, but in this film, despite its length, everything is devoted to the single idea of the glory of its hero. The movie ends with a caption telling us that peace in Jerusalem remains elusive. If that was news to you, you might enjoy this film.",Kingdom of Heaven
42,dromasca,modern politics in history epic form,7,13 October 2005,"'Kingdom of Heaven' is the best historical epics in the recent crop, and it's no wonder because Ridley Scott is probably the living master of the genre. Even if it does not reach the heights of 'Gladiator' there is enough good stuff in this film to make it a good cinema experience. The big problem lies in the fact that dealing with the territory of dispute that is the Middle East and the city of Jerusalem, the film cannot help being influenced by the current conflicts, even if the period it describes is the crusaders time. While trying and succeeding up to a point to be historically accurate, the script tries to be politically correct in contemporary terms. Script writers put in the mouths of the 12th century crusaders and their enemies words that belong better to the 21st century Security Coincil meeting room.Otherwise, it's a well told story of Balian of Ibelin, the last defender of Jerusalem and of the fall of the city to the Arab king Saladin. A story of medieval nobleness and dispute, of religious faith and pre-Renaissance humanism, and of course there is a romantic love story between a commoner and a queen. Unfortunately an ending in the worst Hollywood tradition spoils the authenticity of the story, which is, excepting the end, quite credible, enjoyable, and well acted by a selected cast where Orlando Bloom, Eva Green and Jeremy Irons are the best.Best historical film of the last year, not the best of Ridley Scott.",Kingdom of Heaven
43,MLDinTN,lacks a good story,4,7 February 2006,"This movie suffered from lack of a really good, moving story. It felt similar to Scott's Gladiator, mainly because of its visual style. The snow falling in the forest looked like it came straight from Gladiator. But, while Gladiator had a great story, Kingdom of Heaven is bland and sometimes boring. And Bloom is no Russell Crowe. Bloom plays Balian, a blacksmith, who has just lost a wife and child. His father who is a lord shows up and invites him on a crusade to the Holy Land. He needs to wipe away his sins so joins the journey. He gets involved with religion and politics and is soon conversing with the King of Jeruselum, who values his opinion. He gets involved with the King's married sister. Her husband of course is Balian's rival and wants to go to war and take over power of the city.So, we have several fights, none of which were that entertaining. And I don't know why even throw the love story in because it has about a 5 minute focus, and then Balian is hardly on screen with Sybyilla again. And then you have the last stand for Jerusalem at the end.FINAL VERDICT: The whole basis for a crusade is just too broad to make a movie about. This movie had too much going on so gets boring. What made Gladiator so great was you have this guy and his ultimate tale of revenge. Balian is not that strong of a character. You just don't root for him. I mean, he killed a priest because he couldn't handle the truth about what people thought happens to someone's soul if they commit suicide. So, I only recommend it if you really like movies about history.",Kingdom of Heaven

As the evil Saladin attempt to take over Jerusalem, Balian must be prepared to stop him. The acting is top-notch. I award Orlando Bloom as Best Actor. The performances by Irons, Norton, Thewlis, and Sassoud were great. Ridley Scott's directing skill keeps on getting better with age. The scenery is a wonder and beauty to look at. There is one major problem. The script was not written well and the plot has too many holes. There were times in the film where I had no idea what the heck is going on. It seems like Balian is doing this, that, this etc in 45 minutes. I must admit that I am a generous grader. This would've normally received 6/10, but I rate this 8/10.",Kingdom of Heaven

It was just an OK movie, but quickly forgettable and a bit messy. I was disappointed as i was expected this big great epic. Now some years later i stumble upon the ""Director's Cut"" of this movie, which was more then 45-50 min longer then its theatrical version and desired to see it. What i can safely say - the ""Director's Cut"" of ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is one of the few if not the best example of how a new cut (true vision) can turn the whole movie around in the best possible way. I simply loved Director's Cut of ""Kingdom of Heaven"". It had so many great story lines, which enriched this movie - so many character which in the ""original"" sounded and looked like out of place now had a true meaning with their actions and true consequences.Overall, please see ""Director's Cut"" of ""Kingdom of Heaven"" if you haven't seen it.

47,The-Sarkologist,A fairly lame attempt to recreating the crusades,4,7 February 2014,"I guess one can pretty much tell that this is a Ridley Scott film because it seems to be overtly long and is also overtly sentimental, not to mention that despite being described as being 'the most historically accurate film ever made' (by one of the producers no doubt), not only are there a lot of inconsistencies with they actually story, but Scott has also made an effort to actually rewrite history in the process (something that does not surprise me where Hollywood is concerned, because they seem to go out of their way to rewrite history, and what is really scary, is that we let them – for instance the academy awards that Argo won effectively legitimise that version of the story, despite the fact that that version is not actually true).Anyway, this film is about a crusader named Balin of Ibelin, who goes over to the Holyland to atone for killing a monk and to also make atonement for his wife, who had committed suicide. However, upon arriving them he ends up having a crisis of faith when he realises that this pilgrimage has really done nothing to actually heal his soul. All the while, in the background, the conflict betweem Saladin and the European occupiers of Jerusalem is beginning to brew.What is noticed in this film is that the Christians are held in a bad light because they are portrayed as narrow minded, bigoted individuals who pretty much bring the wrath of Saladin down upon them due to their insistence in attempt to kill all of the Muslims that enter their land. The problem that I have with the Crusades is that people seem to want to hold all Christians accountable for this event that occurred over 1000 years ago. I guess the problem with this is that this event occurred so long ago, and that Christianity is so confronting with regards to the sin of humanity that people need to find ways to throw it back in their face, and the Crusades is one of the the things that people seem to use.At first I liked this film, which is probably why I bought it, however as time wears on, I come to realise how much I really don't like this film, and that it is just another piece of rubbish that blocks our airwaves and prevents anything decent from getting through.",Kingdom of Heaven
48,johnnyboyz,Thoroughly lacking in any sort of fun and adventure whilst also piling up the silliness and the metaphors.,5,9 June 2008,"How can a film be so long, be so expansive, cover so much ground, have so much going on within the boundaries of its universe and yet remain so spectacularly ordinary? Kingdom of Heaven is probably Ridley Scott's biggest ever film, topping his effort in Black Hawk Down which in itself topped Gladiator in terms of length and attention to action over anything else. But Kingdom of Heaven just didn't cut it with me, in fact it ends up as a rather nothing film about not much revolving around something that happened so many years ago that even the historical context is lost within the ocean that is the filmic experience.Kingdom of Heaven is a film that is set amongst a greater backdrop of a real life historical situation. In this case, it is the 12th Century crusades at Jerusalem against the attacking Muslims. Firstly, the audience this film is aimed at I don't think are expected to know an awful lot about these crusades, indeed I don't and must rely on the Internet for necessary information. Secondly, Kingdom of Heaven falls into this trap that has formed which I refer to as the 'post-9/11 blockbuster syndrome'. This means that rather than have big, expansive Hollywood action films that revolve around terrorists, hostages, destroyed Western pieces of iconography and plane hijacks (see Executive Decision, Con Air, Mars Attacks! and Die Hard 3), Hollywood now target the Arabs in general in an attempt to push them into the position of antagonist in their films. The film is about a young, white, attractive male from the West played by an actor as such whom everyone will recognise. It then involves him travelling in a 'fish-out-of-water' scenario to a far off place to battle the incoming, antagonistic Muslims.Orlando Bloom may be British and the film may be listed as a co-production between Britain, Germany and Spain but I feel that's all a little false. The film is big; it's massive but it also relies heavily on star power and money to get that message across. This is twinned with a certain aesthetic of entertainment – when you watch Kingdom of Heaven, you feel as if you are watching an American film; you do not feel as if you are watching a British, German or Spanish film, respectively – those three film industries could not pool all the money they had together and produce something like Kingdom of Heaven. These three film industries do not rely on star power in the same way Kingdom of Heaven does. In fact Kingdom of Heaven is so well endowed that it can rely on covering up its biggest star with a mask for the duration of the film (Edward Norton as King Baldwin).But rather than just adopt a petty political approach, Kingdom of Heaven fails as a film. It eats off the success of previous films in the genre such as The Lord of the Rings whilst bringing nothing new to the table. Orlando Bloom plays Balian de Ibelin, a blacksmith lost and alone in the middle of nowhere. He is visited by some soldiers and eventually decides to come along to the Crusades after a messy initial incident involving a priest. The incident is messy in the sense that what happens to the priest is unpleasant but also because the film gives us the obligatory 'no' from its hero before having him do a U-turn following the incident and then saying 'yes'. I guess he owed it to God. I never pull up an actor for bad acting in these film comments, I feel it's unfair – I don't watch films for acting, I watch them for the reading and analysis but the primary problem with the film is its actor Bloom. When Bloom suffers a revelation regarding who his father is early on, he does not react. When something happens to this father later on, he does not react and when the film enters Braveheart territory later on, Bloom cannot at all deliver a rousing speech to his troops. In fact the only time Bloom ever acts in the film is when the narrative's initial incident forces him to in the scene involving the priest. Bloom shows some anger and reacts because the narrative demands he must.And so with Bloom adopting an 'Aragorn' look and approach, he sets off on this journey that is wavy, sporadic and uninteresting at the best of times. The battles in the film are relatively short, needlessly bloody and just seem basic in their motivation. Early on an Arab is willing to put his life on the line in a bloody battle for the mere acquisition of a horse. The film is also one in which during the battles, the enemy will lunge at the heroes yelling 'Argh!' despite having the element of surprise whereas the heroes themselves will remain silent and deadly, picking off whoever whenever required.So if Kingdom of Heaven is a political film circa 2005, then it's a bad one. The general requirements that make a film either fun to watch or interesting to read into or whatever are lacking and it plays out to its CGI laden conclusion in an anticlimactic and routine manner. In Germany, Spain and Britain the emphasis is always on the director – in Kingdom of Heaven anybody could've taken up the mantle and the best bit is that we are supposed to believe those three respective nations had a say in the production of this film. Yeah, right.",Kingdom of Heaven
49,filipemanuelneto,A historical film made with quality,8,26 June 2016,"This film is based on real historical characters and addresses, fictionally, the loss of Jerusalem to Muslims in 1187, after the defeat of the Crusaders at the Battle of Hattin, against the forces of Saladin. Directed by Ridley Scott, the film has a screenplay by William Monahan and the cast is headed by Orlando Bloom, Eva Green, Liam Neeson and Jeremy Irons.The film deals with the crusades from a new point of view. In other movies we see Christian expeditions. In this film, we see a precise moment in history, where Jerusalem, captured in 1099, is lost again. Many of the characters is based, slightly, in real historical characters, as part of the script as well. Although I'm not an expert, it seems a film that seeks to portray things with some historical accuracy. Thus, costumes and scenery seem to have been designed with some care, in order to meet these standards. The script is interesting. Of course, the story is romanticized and not entirely correspond to the facts, but its quite entertaining and holds the audience until the end. The action scenes are excellent, particularly the battles and the final siege, where the fertile imagination of Hollywood left its mark in the original way the siege engines are being put out of action by the besieged. The scenarios are good, representing well what may have been Jerusalem during that historic period.The actors fulfilled their role on a regular basis. Orlando Bloom is equal to himself and Eva Green made some effort to look more oriental, surprising at the end by purposely overshadowing her character in maternal grief. One of the most emotive and memorable characters is King Baldwin IV, played by Edward Norton (who never shows his face in the film). He's the author of some of the most deep, philosophical and meaningful quotes. The soundtrack, written by Harry Gregson- Williams, is very good and merges harmonically sounds of medieval and Muslim inspiration with the traditional film music.",Kingdom of Heaven
50,leplatypus,The Bloom of Bloom (screen),4,9 May 2005,"This is my 2nd Scott's movie in a month: this time in a real theater. With the experience of my review of Blade Runner, I know it will be an eye-feast, where every detail is essential to appreciate his movies.This one takes place in the XII century, in the time of holy crusades. It is the tale of an ordinary peasant (Bloom) who will embark in a epic. This is for the immediate story and the audience follows it easily. The Middle age universe is brilliantly illustrated, and all the actors are excellent. Bloom is a good surprise for me (I didn't see the Pirates or the Ring Trilogy) and he seems on his way to a great career. He shines all the more than his adversary is greatly played (an illustration of a classic rule in film-making: if you want to do a great film, cast a great ""vilain"") .. and Cocorico !! (as we say in France): the mysteriously beautiful Eva Green is half-French: the daughter of a successful French actress in the 80's.However big the drama may be, the flaw of the movie is its lack of rhythm. Maybe the background of the plot dealing with religious war explains my detachment as I am not a believer, either Christian or Muslim. Indeed, I reacted as Baliant and relayed on my personal values: honor, If you are a believer, then you sure feel more implicated.The only observation I can dare is the recurrent use of the paradox in Scott's movie-making. The major point of view is Christian. And the more faithful of them are depicted sometimes as non tolerant people. On the other hand, Muslim aren't fanatic and they show care (the shot of Saladin picking up the crux after his victory).Ultimately, this isn't a historical period I know. And this movie gives me the desire to learn more about this time to know what really happened. Why asking for more ?",Kingdom of Heaven

52,Fella_shibby,Definitely deserves to be seen on a big screen but the Director's Cut is top notch.,9,5 June 2021,"I first saw this in a theatre in 2005 and inspite of owning a dvd (theatrical version) i never revisited it but revisited the 194 mins Director's Cut few days back.The film has amazing visuals, the landscapes n the battle scenes are stunning.While these kinda movies are enjoyed on the big screen, the Director's Cut makes more sense and has many scenes included, battle scenes are depicted with more violence than in the theatrical cut and the subplot involving Sybilla's son Baldwin V, is added but its very poignant.Also more scenes with Hospitaller offering guidance to Balian are present in the Director's Cut. But a scene where Hospitaller guides Balian after Balian survives an attack by Guy's men looked a bit supernatural.I am generous with a 9 cos the movie is very entertaining.Wud have easily rated it a 10 if the makers wud have given more footage to the character of Saladin, a true chivalrous knight.It is equally true that his generosity, his piety, devoid of fanaticism, that flower of liberality and courtesy which had been the model of our old chroniclers, won him no less popularity in Frankish Syria than in the lands of Islam - René Grousset (writer).Despite the Crusaders' slaughter when they originally conquered Jerusalem in 1099, Saladin granted amnesty and free passage to all common Catholics and even to the defeated Christian army, (the Greek Orthodox Christians were treated even better, because they often opposed the western Crusaders).",Kingdom of Heaven
53,jzappa,"Bold Move, Ridley. Kudos.",8,26 December 2010,"Scott was bold to release a mainstream American movie in 2005 about the hostilities between Christians and Muslims for domination of Jerusalem. I imagine few of those faiths are able to view his strongly pertinent film without bias. Both Muslims and Christians have endeavored to highlight its faults. When you've riled both sides, you've probably done something correctly. Others, however, recognize that the film is neither in support or opposition of Islamic or Christian belief, and yet somehow an intense spiritual feat. Maybe since for its hero Balian, who is a skeptic, all devout attachments diminish during his sorrowful pursuit of a righteous principle in life, which leads to an interesting aspect of the film, which is that they talk very little about religion. A gutsy and principled thinker-warrior rather than a tough, breast-beating commandant, Balian uses reason over muscle to obtain the upper hand in combat. The Crusades are still a Holy War by the Christians to secure Jerusalem from the Muslims, but---at least for the first hour and a half---sees his characters as more interested in individual entitlement and encroachment than with matters of reverence.Several characters are fictionalized renderings of historical figures. The story follows Balian, a parish blacksmith in France, finds he's the illicit offspring of Sir Godfrey, a knight returning from the Middle East, who speaks of Jerusalem as regards a holy war but its prospects for an striving young man: It has a vigorous economy when medieval Europe is otherwise sluggish.For the century leading up to the action, both Christians and Muslims were at ease seeing one another worship in the holy city. It was only when Christian fanatics eager to dictate the Holy Land more tightly that all went awry. The movie is set around 1184, as the city is governed by the young King Baldwin, who has leprosy and hides his warped face behind a silver mask.What Scott appears to be proposing is that most Christians and Muslims might be capable of synchronizing unperturbed were it not for the radicals on either side, a simplistic precept as breakable as the ten commandments. Nevertheless, this may clarify why the movie has upset the very variety of Muslims and Christians who will take temperance as an insult. At any rate though, most everyday moviegoers will not care much about the movie's theological thesis, and will be engaged by those basics of all historical epics, fights and love interests. The latter here is between Balian and Sibylla, sister of King Baldwin. You might doubt how a blacksmith could entice a princess, though consider that Sir Godfrey was right about Jerusalem, particularly after his recently revealed father knights him, and Tiberias recruits him as an assistant to Baldwin. And one pretty cool battle scene concerns the siege of Saladin's army on Christian Jerusalem, and it's one of those great set pieces with massive orbs of fire that plunge and land near---but not near enough---to the central characters.There is a particular magnitude that's expected in films of this kind, and Scott is known for his mastery of it. Still, I benefited from the dialogue and narrative more than the action. Any film with the courage to refer to the enmity of the children of Abraham merits to be admired for its sincerity and diplomacy, but I've seen a few enormous desert cities too many. Nor do thousands of stampeding, fated horses seem spanking new to me, and the close-range fighting seems strangely like all other such instances. Godfrey gives Balian a tutorial in swordsmanship, though evidently the crucial thing to consider is that if you're an undistinguished opponent you die, and if you're a hero you live unless a celebrated demise is necessary. You'd think people would be killed virtually unintentionally amidst a thousand sword-swinging madmen, yet each confrontation is categorized into a quarrel between a conqueror and the defeated.What's more attractive is Ridley Scott's visual fashion, supported by John Mathieson's cinematography and the production design of Arthur Max, where the cinematography, supporting performances, and battle sequences are fastidiously arranged. It's score of moving chorales contrast with Muslim sanctified chants, and restrained implementation of modern rock and pop effects. An immense set of medieval Jerusalem was built to afford convincing forefronts and locations, which were then augmented by CGI backdrops, extra horses and throngs, etc. Moreover there's stimulating footage of young Balian forging to Jerusalem.The movie is primarily about the individual policies of its heroes, both Christian and Muslim. They're of nobility. They've seen enough carnage and lost enough companions to look with a cynical perceptiveness at the fanatics who goad them into combat. There's a scene where Baldwin and Saladin convene on a measureless plane between their assembled forces, and settle, diplomatically, to terminate the battle at that moment. Later, Balian's pre-battle oration to his army seems remarkably repentant.",Kingdom of Heaven
54,Vartiainen,The extended director's cut is amazing,10,25 July 2015,"Only see the extended director's cut of this film! The original theatrical version completely cuts away all the character development, intrigue and motives, leaving you with a story that looks and sounds great, but lacks all stages and excitement. It's still a good story, but you don't really get a feeling for the characters or why they do what they do. Certain key scenes explaining characters's backgrounds and motivations are completely missing, making it into a hollow experience.But, if you're watching the director's cut, you're in for a phenomenal experience. Based on the real world events in Jerusalem during the Crusades of the 12th century, it follows the story of Balian (Orlando Bloom), a humble blacksmith in this version of the story, as he is found by his nobleborn father and taken to Jerusalem to inherit his father's lands and title. But at the same time rebellion brews in Jerusalem as the king (Edward Norton) is dying and the more fanatical of the crusaders are ready to wage war against Saracens and their new leader Saladin (Ghassan Massoud).Ridley Scott has always been excellent with historical epics, but this might very well be my favourite from him so far. Everything this movie does is huge, from the settings to the props to the music, but what I really like is the human element. Bloom makes for a very effective main character and Balian's struggle to upheld the noble intentions of his father, even as the whole kingdom is set to fall around him, cannot help but arouse your sympathies.The side characters are also amazing. This is one of the finest roles Norton has ever done, and he's done a lot. His King of Jerusalem embodies the nobility of royal ruler. The same can be about Saladin, and the scene where the two meet on the field of battle is one of the movie's finest. They're on the opposite sides, yet the respect they have for each other is as clear as the sun on the sky.I love this film. If I had to name one flaw, I'd say that the ending falls to certain sentimentality, but everything else... perfect. No complaints. All of it simply comes together and it's exactly the kind of epic I want to watch. Heavily recommended.",Kingdom of Heaven
55,thinker1691,""" I've seen the Fanatic lunacy of every denomination called the Will of God """,10,5 April 2009,"The creative genius award is easily given to film maker Ridley Scott. He has put together the finest cinematic projects few would contest. This film "" The Kingdom of Heaven "" is another crowning achievement in his long list of accomplishments. Taken from the historical records concerning the Crusades to the Holy Land in the 12th century, the incredible saga centers on a young man named Balian a (Orlando Bloom) Blacksmith living peacefully in France. Unexpectedly, a returning Crusader Knight stops by his small shop and reveals, he is Godfrey de Ibelin (Liam Neeson) his Father. Seeking forgiveness for both his wife's sins and his own, the young man joins his father on the return journey to Jerusulem. Along the way Balian acquires knowledge of his nobility and the skills of a knight. Upon reaching his estate in Ibelin, he realizes forgiveness in life is not for the asking, but in courageous combat, noble confrontations and chivalrous deeds required by his station in life. Through his awareness of the impeding war between the Crusaders and the Muslims, he learns quickly the traitorous elements within his immediate circle like Reynald De Chatillon (Brendan Gleeson) and Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas) ambitious unscrupulous knights determined to disrupt the peaceful efforts made toward the Muslims. Balian also learns respect for King Baldwin (Edward Norton) of Jerusulam and his steadfast ally Tiberias (Jeremy Irons) who are attempting to bring peace to the great city. It is here defending the center of Christendom, he faces the greatest task of all. He must wage successful defense of the ancient city against the Great Sa-lah Ad-Din who's military prowess became the foundation of a reputation to span the ages. Director Ridley Scott establishes a remarkable tapestry of large landscape action, monstrous siege weapons and monumental clashing armies as to quench the appetite of any viewer. In doing so, he creates not only a cinematic masterpiece, but a Medieval Classic for all time. Wonderful motion picture! *****",Kingdom of Heaven
56,freemantle_uk,Kingdom of Heaven Director's Cut Review,8,16 January 2010,"Kingdom of Heaven is the first film that shows Tom Rothman destructive reign over Fox's Movie division. He is a man who wants to dumb down and shorten films, focusing on action and making films PG-13, and having barely any story. Rothman who forced Bryan Singer away from the X-Men series, annoyed Matthew Vaughn when directing X-Men: the Last Stand, screwed over Gavin Hood with Wolverine, messed up Babylon A.D. to the point that it's direct said audiences should avoid, made Hit-man PG-13 and reshot it with a different director and made Live Free and Die Hard PG-13. He has screwed over good and up-and-coming directors. He even messed around with a legend like Ridley Scott, making Kingdom of Heaven from having a lot of substance to a dumb action flick. Luckily Ridley Scott had a backup plan: he is the man who invented the director's cut, so he released a 3 hour long version of Kingdom of Heaven.In 1184 the Christian Kingdom of Jerusalem is surrounded by the hostile forces of Saladin (Ghassan Massoud). The kingdoms are living an uneasy truce, the Christian, King Baldwin IV (Edward Norton), wants peace between the Christians and Muslims. But there are forces within Baldwin's camp who wants to go to war with the Muslims. Even amongst the threat of war, a lot of Christians go to protect the kingdom and find forgiven. One man is Balain (Orlando Bloom), a French blacksmith and the bastard son of a lord, Godfrey of Ibelin (Liam Neeson). Balain's wife had recently killed herself and he ends up killing a Catholic priest. Balain's father offers him the chance of redemption, if he goes to Jerusalem. On the way, Godfrey dies, and Balain become the lord of his lands in the Holy land. He quickly shows himself to be a good lord, and he allies himself Baldwin IV and the marshal of Jerusalem, Raymond (Jeremy Irons). They are the modest who want peace. But the leader of the Knight Templars, and Baldwin's brother in law, Guy of Lusignan (Marton Csokas) is itching for a fight with the Muslims. In the the complex religious and political climate, Balain show his skills as a fighter and a leader, but also he develops feeling for Princess Sibylla (Eva Green), Guy's wife and the mother to the heir of the throne.The Crusades is a complex period of history, with Christian forces going to Holy Land a number of times. It is a period the Muslims dread, seeing it as a time when Barbarian hoards tried to take their lands. It was motivated by religion, land and money, the Muslims offered a handy scapegoat for the Catholic Church. This film is a bold, if little inaccuracy attempt to show this in an entertaining manner. When this film was made they were people proclaiming that this was going to be an Islamophobic film, which would drive up conflict. In my opinion the Muslim were treated in a balanced way, the film shows heroes and villains on both sides of the conflict, the main antagonist was a Christian who wanted to go to war. It's better to say the crap-fest Braveheart which made out that all Scots were good whilst the English did everything possible to be Evil.Ridley Scott is a master of his craft: he is a director who can take you to another world. Look at his previous films. He does take you back to the middle ages in the middle of a complex conflict. He shows the characters, and brings in realistic violence. But there is an old fashion style to the film, similar to what David Lean did with Lawrence of Arabia. Scott handles the drama and action with great skill. Scott also worked with closely with William Monahan who himself is a man of talent. The Art-Direction, Costume Design and Cinematography were also of a high level, all worthy of Oscar nods.There is a good cast for the film, even with smaller roles; Michael Sheen, Liam Neeson, Jeremy Irons, Edward Norton, Marton Csokas, Jeremy Irons, David Thewlis and the lovely Eva Green. What do you want? Well maybe a better lead. This is Orlando Bloom's best role outside the Lord of the Rings films, but he still seemed a bit to wet and weak for this time type of role. It needed a bigger action.Whilst the film is good, I do have to mark it down for historical inaccuracies. One good example that affects the realism is how can a blacksmith be able to be good knight and command with no training? Also I doubt an illegitimate child could inherited someone lands. The other main issues was that Christian, Muslims and Jews all hated each other, they did not make a good of living together like the film makes out.If you are going to watch this film: watch the Director Cut. It deeper and more detailed that the theatrical cut was.",Kingdom of Heaven
57,XweAponX,"""Vide Cor Meum""",10,3 April 2006,"I had thought Hans Zimmer did the soundtrack like he did for countless other Scott pictures... Actually, the soundtrack is a clever montage of ""aquired"" music from other films and some other sources- Plus whatever Harry Gregson-Williams wrote original. The music in this film is wonderfully placed, each piece.Ridley Scott is mostly always great, but of course when you have raw material like Orlando Bloom, Liam Neeson, Brendan Gleeson, Marton Csokas (playing a villain as usual, no more Celeborn roles for Marton) and Jeremy Irons then there is going to be some good swordplay.I was watching the character named Nasir and wondering where in blazes have I seen him before? And of course it was Alexanber Siddig from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and great that he got out of the Trek rut. Finally, I have never seen Eva Green in anything, but she was well cast in this, and I look forward to other films she may be in And so this film shows us that there are ""good"" people and ""bad"" people in positions of world power and our little ""Kingdoms of Heaven"" have to be set in our minds... Cos if we have to depend on any sort of government or Leader, it ain't gonna last. In the case of the time of this film, it lasted about 100 years. A brief respite compared to the thousands of years of strife that defines ""The Holy Land."" The main point is that, two people of violently opposing viewpoints can have respect for each other, like Saladin and King Baldwin IV (in real life as well, from what I have read).And if two people, a Christian and a Moslem can have that kind of respect and even friendship, then it may be possible to lift ourselves out of the religious quagmire that we are suffocating in.",Kingdom of Heaven
58,CubsandCulture,"The studio butchered this film-theatrical 6 out of 10, director's cut 10 out of 10",8,12 April 2021,"I saw this movie in the theatre a couple of times back in 2005. I have always liked it because of the impressive action set pieces and the surprisingly fair rendering of the Crusades. (If anything the Christians come off as more brutal then they actual were). I also liked Bloom's performance a great deal. But the theatrical cut is merely a serviceable action film or historical epic. The characterizations are quite thin-and sometimes confusing, why is Balian so versed in tactics?- and the film never seemed to gel thematically-it weirdly comes across as merely anticlerical just because. Back in 2005 it was nice seeing a Anglo-American film not demonizes Muslims but as a *film* it was not all that great.I just watched the roadshow director's cut that adds about ~45 minutes along with Overture, Intermission Entr'acte sections and it is like an entirely different film. The theatrical cut is mostly about the political-social conflict over the Holy Land. The director's cut is a mediation on faith as it relates to the will of man and the will of God and a stunning rebuke of the Crusades from a universalist Christian perspective. Every character is given greater depth and while some of the exposition is a little clunky-Balian is merely asserted to have battle experience in the 1st act-it all adds up to a much richer film. The director's cut is legitimately one of Scott's best films.Both cuts have top notch production values and even in the mutilated theatrical cut captures the haunting beauty the film is going for.",Kingdom of Heaven
59,Chris_Docker,Lord of the Rings meets Gladiator,5,6 May 2005,"Except for easily pleased fans of Orlando Bloom (who gets his shirt off at one point), prepare to be at least a bit disappointed. In this historic epic over the battle over Jerusalem during the Crusades, director Ridley Scott throws the occasional glance to contemporary issues. We are reminded that it was the Christians picked the first fight when it came to the conflict between Islam and Christianity, for instance. One side, Saladin and his advisors, are treated quite respectfully - whereas the Christian clergy are mostly corrupt. The night-time assault on Jerusalem (by the Muslims) has some visual similarity to the U.S. 'shock and awe' campaign on Baghdad; and Bloom spouts the occasional line to remind us that the Kingdom of Heaven is in the head and the heart, and one of conscience, not one of bricks and mortar. A better film, at a time when control of Jerusalem is one of the most pressing international issues of the day, might have been capable of sparking discussion as to whether the holy city should be administered internationally for all faiths by the United Nations, but its faltering script, wooden acting and a depth that goes no further than a few trite phrases, means it has to rest its case more on whether it has value as entertainment.Kingdom of Heaven is not a terrible film, and it is beautifully shot. There are photogenic battle scenes (some of the aspects of rendering vast armies probably built on Lord of the Rings special effects), photogenic moonrises, photogenic desert scenes, photogenic slow-motion warriors with the sun glancing off the camera lens. As a reminder of a half forgotten period of history it fills a space. The attempts to appease a Muslim audience, however, seem badly researched (though they may appease the Christian need to feel 'good and charitable'); Orlando Bloom looks as if he could barely lead a party of tourists to the edge of the Dead Sea, much less inspire and command vast armies. He does not yet have the consummate acting skills of Russell Crowe's Gladiator and rarely looks anything more than an actor walking about on stage. Starting life as a blacksmith, Balian, his personal traumas impel him onward to virtuous bravery, yet we see no expression of deep emotion beyond the need for battle. He learns to be a master swordsman during a few minutes before his battle, yet manages to survive unspeakable dangers in combat with barely a scratch. When he sets out from his village to embark on his quest, one is almost reminded of his earlier LOTR portrayal as Legolas, but his story here is devoid of depth or conviction in its slender story. That the whole thing survives for 2 hours 25 minutes (after cuts) is more a testament to the amount of dollars poured into it than the amount of attention it merits from an audience.",Kingdom of Heaven

Without a compelling hero to anchor it, all of the large-scale battles you can cram into 2 1/2 hours amount to very little. Some of the blame for that lay at the feet of actor Orlando Bloom. Always charisma-challenged, he's never been more wooden than he is here. Still, as written, the character of Balian is still dull and flat.Also dull and flat is the story. Content not to choose sides, Scott serves up a slice of PC, ""Can't we all just get along?"" mumbo jumbo that lacks any of the depth and nuance to do any real justice to this thousand year old conflict.",Kingdom of Heaven

62,noralee,Would Be Better As a Silent Epic with Orchestral Soundtrack,5,2 June 2005,"""Kingdom of Heaven"" would work very well as a silent movie with its terrific percussive soundtrack as accompaniment.Orlando Bloom is breathtakingly beautiful as he poses in the spectacular production design. But even after having watched all the co-promotional ersatz history ""documentaries"" on cable A & E, the History and Discovery Channels, I still can't figure out if Bloom's character ""Balian"" is even a composite of real people, particularly as to his actions in the Holy Land with the inevitable ""into the breach"" type speech to a rag tag army. (It is amusing that seemingly every one in the Holy Land says to him: ""I didn't know he had a son."") The plot, such as it is, puts the best face possible on the Crusades, at a mid-point when some are disillusioned and pushing for coexistence in Jerusalem. The actors portraying fair Arabs have the most gravitas (Alexander Siddig has established a nice post-""Star Trek"" niche as a noble Arab), especially compared to an incongruous-seeming Liam Neeson (as when he has to explain that he didn't really rape ""Balian""s mother - ""I forced her, but not against her will. I loved her in my fashion."") and the usual hot-headed bad guy who, surprisingly, is actually based on a real person, played by Marton Csokas. Jeremy Irons at least carries off bitter irony well.I'm not sure if it's Bloom's deadpan deliveries, (even bending over backwards to be explained as his character being in mourning shock), or Ridley Scott's overall directing that makes the film devoid of emotion. Eva Green is only a visual accoutrement; her discreet seduction scene of ""Balian"" could only be sexy to the twelve year old boys I presume this R rated film is really inexplicably aimed for (though it's also possible she's bedding him for political machinations as another explanation), so it's hard to believe it's the same actress from ""The Dreamers."" The film really picks up during the battle scenes, which are like a medieval version of Scott's ""Black Hawk Down"" and include an even more fascinating recreation of period fortresses and armory than PBS's Nova episode on ""Medieval Siege,"" as he had a heck of a larger budget. Another striking visual is also true to history, the king who hides his leprosy behind a mask.In the battle of the recent epics, this rates far higher than ""Alexander"" and about equal with ""Troy,"" which had the advantage of the Homeric story and gleaming hard bodies.",Kingdom of Heaven

Aside from the tent, the movie takes too much literary license.Add to that the overrated Liam, a favorite among the brain dead types, but he makes real actors and talents groan in agony with his wooden Hollywood one dimensional macho act.What makes the movie suffer is the lame story line of the hero. He just isn't inspired, or the inspiration isn't sufficient for a viewer. We don't buy his ingenuity. He is more of a family man, one who functions as a cog, not an innovator.Also, the character of Guy is a bit off. He was more of a coward than the movie shows. Montreal was also a more romantic, dashing figure than the movie shows, which made his evil even more abhorrent to Saladin and others.The truth be told, this was a vehicle which could easily have been a grand piece of inspiration for a side story. One gets the feeling that better scripts were tossed aside, with some ideas stolen from them to go into a formula film, which this looked like.This should have been much better.",Kingdom of Heaven
66,jaybob,Possibly the best film made about the Crusades,10,8 May 2005,"Revised review written 5/18/2008The review below was written on May 8 2005,& was based on the 142 minute running time.Last night I saw the more complete version which runs 194 minutes. It explains some of the details that were given short shrift the first time.The same praise I gave this 3 years back, still applies, It was & still is a monumental film & should be seen by all.At no point is it boring,it is interesting all the way through & you really care for all the peoples,even the ones that supposedly are the villains.The ratings for both versions are the same.Throughout cinema history, There have been many films made about The Crusades, They were always done from the Christian viewpoint,. where the knights very noble & honest men & the Muslims were dastardly evil or cunning.Now this version, we come closer to the truth, where we see good & evil on both sides. The Director Ridley Scott,who is known for action films has crafted a superior film, & if this was December & not May I would venture a guess it would be nominated for many Oscars. (I do hope 20th Century Fox re-releases this in December so it can be deservedly honoured.)Mr.Scott did direct GLADIATOR a few years back & won some Oscars. (this reviewer did not think it deserved them). This time however, he has assembled a cast & crew that worked together & created a memorable film.It stars Orlando Bloom, He has done good work in other films, in KINGDOM OF HEAVEN he not only carries the film,He NOW has become an actor,who will get the roles to match his talent. Liam Neeson has a small role & as usual is great,Jeremy Irons & David Thewles as usual are excellent & in a small role & unbilled is Edward Norton as the leper King Baldwin, (he is in a silver mask for all his scenes ---spoiler alert--the mask is removed on his DeathBed & we see the ravishes of his leprosy----excellent job of make up.The only female role is portrayed by Eva Green ( I do not remember seeing her before---but will look for other films she has been in). Most films of this type the lead actress is usually there for decoration or for sexual purposes. NOT HERE. Not only is she beautiful, she can act & her role is vital to the screenplay.William Monahan has written a literate script that is easy to follow & understand the complexities of the time(Just before the 3rd Crusade).Normally I have trouble hearing the dialogue in many films due the Dolby sound system..Here they use the SUPERIOR THX sound system & you can hear all the dialogue.The action scenes are brilliantly done 100 % better than THE GLADIATOR. Of course many scenes are computer generated & as hard as I tried to look,I was not aware of any images done by the computer: In Gladiator there were many obvious such images.There is a fair amount of brutality, BUT the times were brutal,the battle scenes were natural BUT not off-putting like in a certain film,(Saving Pvt.Ryan).Most of all the characters were real people (Liam Neeson's character was fictitious). There is information on these little know historical personages on the Web. Look them up.& then see this GREAT MOVIE.My rating **** (out of 4) 99 points (out of 100) IMDb 10",Kingdom of Heaven
67,Enchorde,Just great!,9,5 October 2005,"Recap: Balian is in deep sorrow, his wife just committed suicide after their son died. So, she is condemned by the church, and he is not very popular either. Then he gets a visit from the knight Godfrey who claims to be his father. Godfrey is on his way to the Holy Land, to Jerusalem, and asks Balian to join him. Balian first declines but changes his mind after having a little quarrel that leaves the village priest dead. Unfortunately, killing priests doesn't score very high on any popularity chart, and Balian soon is a wanted man. But Godfrey refuses to give up his son, and a fight ensues where Godfrey is badly wounded. Soon Balian finds himself both knight and nobleman. After some small detours he reaches Jerusalem, but the salvation and forgiveness he seeks eludes him. Instead he finds ambition, political strife, and warmongering. A lot of people, and especially Reynald and Guy de Lusignan doesn't agree with the kings policy that Jerusalem should be open to people of all faiths. Interestingly, on the Muslim side, the same case is made, with the same arguments. Baldwin, the king of Jerusalem and Saladin, king of the Arabs, struggles to keep peace. But when Baldwin dies of leprosy Guy arises to the throne, and war is close.Comments: A very good movie, well made in most aspects. It is long, but I never found it dull. Do not be mistaken though, this is no non-stop action movie. Long parts of it is more about politics, love, how to realize oneself and so on. Many aspects I thought was a a comment to the situation today, and gave mostly sound advice. It is a very fine point made when warmongers on both sides uses the same argument, especially their best one, ""God wishes it"". Still, when it is time for action, it is full action. Good sword fights, which Balian gets the hang of surprisingly quick, nice effects and just the feeling I searches for when I see a movie with knights and swords. So I guess, as for directing and story, two thumbs up. In the department of acting, I think all gave good performances. Orlando Bloom did a nice job of the lead role, Jeremy Irons a very strong performance in a supporting role, Eva Green was an pleasant new acquaintance and it was nice to see Alexander Siddig again, and Sam Neill, great as always, just to mention a few. Honestly, I only think that there is one mistake in the movie, and that is that the Arabs speak English during a council. A subtitled council in correct language had been much more authentic, and had felt better.9/10",Kingdom of Heaven
68,ShootingShark,Spectacular But Predictable Crusaders Sword-And-Sandal Epic,5,14 December 2008,"In 1184, a lowly blacksmith discovers he is the heir to a barony and makes a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. There he is caught up in the war between Christian Crusaders and Islamic Saracens, and is forced to defend the city against the vast army of King Saladin.As historical epics go this one is pretty good, as might be expected from a director of Scott's immense talent. It looks sensational, with lovely costumes, evocative locations (it was shot mostly in Morocco), impressive visual effects and plenty of blood'n'guts without ever being gratuitous or offensive. Bloom is also good in the lead, his thoughtful and understated performance nevertheless brimming with passion; his skill belying his boyish good looks. The supporting cast is good, notably Gleeson (as a mad warmonger), Thewlis (as a warrior priest) and Siddig (as a wily cavalier). Best of all is an excellent score by Harry Gregson-Williams, which eschews the loud pomposity which is standard for such pictures with lilting, rippling themes, tinted with Arabic influences and delicate percussion. However, I'm afraid I'm just not much of a fan of this genre. The problems are always the same for me - there's no humour, it's hard to identify with the characters and keep up with the politics, there's always lavish attention to period detail and then some bird walks on wearing modern cosmetics, the big battle scenes are a predictable mix of bird's-eye longshots and hack-and-slash closeups. I also don't care for historical mangling - Balian of Ibelin was a real person, and the defence of Jerusalem did happen, but just about everything else in the movie is fiction. Why do this ? Either make an accurate, informative documentary, or make up something fun. I never understand this need to reinvent history in cinema. William Monahan's screenplay is gripping enough, and it's nice to see the Muslim lads portrayed as courageous and chivalrous for once in a big Hollywood flick, but I'm afraid I prefer made up mythologies (Excalibur, Conan The Barbarian, Scott's earlier Legend) every time. However, this British-Spanish-American-German co-production is an impressive undertaking and a lavish spectacle. This review is of the 145-minute theatrical release; Scott added fifty more minutes for the subsequent DVD version - man, I wish filmmakers wouldn't do that.",Kingdom of Heaven
69,valleyjohn,Bloom wasn't right for the lead,7,18 July 2020,"When Kingdom of Heaven was release in the cinema , Director Ridley Scott disowned the movie. He thought it was edited badly an said that the directors cut is the definitive version.
I think I must have seen the cinematic version because I was underwhelmed with the film despite its spectacular set pieces .After a perilous journey to the holy city, the valiant young man enters the retinue of the leprous King Baldwin IV , which is rife with dissent led by the treacherous Guy de Lusignan , who wishes to wage war against the Muslims for his own political and personal gain.I have had many people say to me that I had to see this film but I can honestly say I thought it was pretty ordinary, especially considering it's a Ridley Scott film .I don't think Orlando Bloom is a strong enough actor or personality to carry off the role of Balian . He spent lots of the film looking vacant and posed for the camera .
The rest of the cast are great , especially Marton Csokas and David Thewlis.I loved the battle scenes near the end and they make it worth watching and I also like the fact that the muslims are not seen as the bad guys and aren't lazily stereotyped as you see in other films .All in all I was a little disappointed but that's probably because I saw the wrong version . Or did I ?",Kingdom of Heaven
70,Blueghost,"Visually sumptuous, but a little presumptive",10,23 September 2012,"I like Ridley Scott as a visual film maker. I think he is able to stage shots and characters, but I've always had a hard time with him as anything beyond a maker of commercials (in spite of my review on Black Hawk Down, but more on that later). The reason is because of films like this.""Kingdom of Heaven"" is a social statement in an attempt to bring a more stable and passive view of the turmoils in the middle east. I remember Ebert and Roper reviewing this film with that kind of framing; this film is about embracing differences and solving problems, even though it has some of the biggest battle scenes filmed since Spartacus. The film is not pro-Christian, nor pro-Muslim, nor really a statement against either religion, but a social psychologists suggested solution to the problems that pervade the middle east to this day.The other truth be told about this film is that was going to be the market competitor to ""Arn the Templar"", a Nordic film and TV series revolving around a trilogy of books regarding a knight who travels to the Holy Land after suffering an injustice in his own homeland (Sweden or Norway, I can't remember which). ""Arn"" had the unfortunate circumstance of being produced in the Nordic countries, where film is highly regulated by government. Ergo Ridley Scott's production went into full swing with a couple hundred million dollars, and was finished even before ""Arn"" could get through the pre-production phase.As such the international audience was treated to a very rich visual feast of a film, as is Ridley Scott's trademark, as we see Balien and his contemporaries grapple with the middle east problem; the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The film is exceptionally well staged. I mean visuals for a historic period pieces don't get much better than this. To rival it you have to go back to classic Hollywood when historic epics were all the rage to even get a hint at what Ridley Scott's team have put on the screen. Historically accurate costumes for the Saracens with their scimitars and short bows, to the quintuple gold cross on blue field for the tabards worn by the knights loyal to Jerusalem, and, of course, the Templars and Hospitallers with their respective red and black crosses on white fields. The castle battlements, the carracks and dromonds plying Mediterranean waters, the arid and sometimes dramatic skies as ordered by Scott himself; truly there is little to criticize here in terms of pure visuals. Outstanding stuff.But the story, though mostly solid, suffers from antagonists who are somewhat full of themselves emotionally. One, Brenden Gleason's character is shown to be a self centered uncaring, almost sociopathic like, Templar who re-ignites the whole war between French Christian forces and the Islamic empire surrounding Jerusalem. He's shown as being deceptive, but also not caring for the sake of not caring. The performance is fine, but the direction Scott gave his character, based on the script, is somewhat conflicting. There's a passion there, but there's also a lack of remorse for anything. Martin Csokas character is another oddity in the same frame. Self centered, he cares little for anything or anyone else, and is given a near comedic and melodramatic tinge. So much that one wonders what kind of character he is. He's almost unreal.The point here is that both these characters, in the film makers perspective, were the true causes of the war between Christendom and Islam, and that anything else you've heard of regarding the wealth or poverty, or even the need to push violent minded European warriors elsewhere, or just an attitude of honor or entitlement on the part of European nobility, is simply not the case. The true cause are the emotionally defunct or mal-aligned characters portrayed on the screen. And that's my problem with Ridley Scott's films, because I personally disagree with the premise, and I also see a kind of agenda at work here.But, it is a film, and only a film, so you can't fault it nor take it too seriously, because it's only meant for entertainment value, though the film makers suggest that some key figures needed some therapy sessions, or needed to be locked up.Some outstanding performances are given here, particularly to Edward Norton playing the leper king. His voice and costume meld superbly to bring us a man aged and wizened before his time. He is a young man with the wisdom of dozen elders, and seeks to know more. There's Liam Neeson's aged fatherly knight, who is the Baron of Ibelin, a principality of Jerusalem. He is stern but also mature. He realizes that at his age, even though he is still a stout warrior, that things will not get easier for him. There is the Hospitaller who seems to have some deific aura about him, and both reassures and tells Balien the truth about being a good man, a good knight, and what religion means to him. When all is said and done, there're action and battle sequences. Good stuff, if somewhat over the top here and there. Nevertheless we're given a slice of history that without the magic of Scott's productions, we simply would not be able to see.Overall an excellent film with magnificent visuals, good solid performances from the actors, incredible art direction, well researched, but narrowly misses the mark in the thematic department. Regardless, it is a fantastic medieval epic rendered for us by a master director, Ridley Scott.Enjoy.",Kingdom of Heaven
71,rosscinema,Impressive looking film lacks emotional punch,6,22 May 2005,"There are two main reasons Hollywood has been giving the green light to these sword and sandal epics (with biblical implications) and the first is of course the huge successes of both ""Gladiator"" and ""The Passion of the Christ"" but the second reason has to do with 911 and the origins of the turmoil in the Middle East. Even with something like this from a truly gifted filmmaker cannot keep audiences from starting to feel that they are being over saturated with films in this genre and one has to wonder what others are on the way. Story is set in 1184 where a recently widowed blacksmith named Balian (Orlando Bloom) is reunited with his father (Liam Neeson) who's a knight on his way back to his estate near Jerusalem.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Balian's father is killed during the trek but upon his arrival in the sacred city he meets the knight Tiberias (Jeremy Irons) who convinces King Baldwin (Edward Norton) to keep him on as an aide. King Baldwin is suffering horribly from leprosy and is forced to wear a mask but this doesn't keep him from trying to keep peace in Jerusalem between the Christians and the Muslims. Balian also starts a romance with Sibylla (Eva Green) who's the king's sister but her husband Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas) seizes the throne and starts a holy war with the Muslims who also want to rule the city. The leader of the Muslims Saladin (Ghassan Massoud) brings his army and for days a bloody battle ensues at the walls of the city but to end the bloodshed Balian agrees to a treaty and surrenders over the city.There are very few directors other than Ridley Scott who can make a film as impressive as this and while this effort doesn't have the star power of ""Gladiator"" nor the overpowering immediacy of ""Black Hawk Down"" it's still a film that (despite a sense of ""been there done that"") has more than it's share of relevance. Screenwriter William Monohan did make the expected changes (to tidy up the film's presentation) and this naturally brought out critics from both sides but the film maintains a more neutral position. The casting may be one of the flaws in the film and I think the jury's still out on just how good of an actor Bloom is and one can't help but think that the more seasoned sword fighters would have sliced him to pieces in a battle! The other problem I have is what I mentioned above in that I think audiences are getting a little burnt out on these epics and I'm not sure what takes place on screen is something that we haven't seen already in some shape or form. Although I am recommending this incredibly well crafted and impressive looking film I'm still not convinced that what was presented on screen was something that we haven't seen recently and I think the studios had better think twice before they decide to go ahead with another similar effort.",Kingdom of Heaven

73,pc95,Another entry in a over-flowing genre - decent not outstanding,6,29 October 2005,"Kingdom of Heaven seems like a film I'd just seen. It is more or less a repeat of the genre with nothing really ground-breakingly new. This genre is starting to get repetitive. Funny Scott brought it back full force with Gladiator. This movie lacks the stunning action and pull of the main character. That being said, it is photographed very well, and has some interesting characters. Orlando Bloom seems to be a sought after actor these days. He's excellent in Lord of the Rings. Though he is not my favorite, he's not bad by any stretch here. I Thought the beginning of the movie was stronger than the last third of it. The movie suffered from a lack of a hard-line villain, but perhaps that was the point anyway, and the lead lady was quite unremarkable and bland. Jeremy Irons gives good support as a disillusioned knight. And I knew the King's voice sounded familiar (as Edward Norton)However the movie suffers from the terrible brainless void of throwing in solo female voice singing to somehow lift scenes' poignancies - it never ever works - though it wasn't rampant here like in some other movies. I cringe every time I hear it. I'd prefer King Arthur to this movie by sheer entertainment value. Just because something has more historical base doesn't mean it merits greater praise or interest. Still Kingdom of Heaven is worth one viewing.",Kingdom of Heaven
74,lewiskendell,Bloom and a weak script hold this back from reaching the promised land.,6,11 July 2010,"""There'll be a day when you will wish that you had done a little evil to do a greater good.""   My main problems with Kingdom of Heaven begin and end with Orlando Bloom. Both his character in the movie, and the actual actor. I'm sorry, but he was a terrible fit for this. I can buy him as an elf. I can buy him as Will Turner, pirate extraordinaire. But I didn't find him the least bit credible, in this role. This was way beyond him. Russel Crowe, he is not. As for the actual character, his meteoric rise from village blacksmith to the heights of power is tough to swallow. Men of great power give Balian so much respect, trust, and incredibly important positions, based on...what? Who his father was? He just has no real character development to convince the audience that he's worthy of leading armies, or that his sudden (and frankly, unbelievable) relationship with Princess Sibylla is based on anything besides the writer's need to have it in the story. That kind of weak and shallow writing (which is sadly not only limited to the character of Balian, all of the characters are little more than caricatures) really irks me, and it definitely hurt the movie. Bland is not an admirable description of this kind of character. On the positive side, the scale of the movie is beyond impressive. The battles are well- choreographed and appropriately epic, the desert and city setting are beautiful and authentic, and the excellent cinematography captures it all beautifully. I genuinely wanted to learn more about this time in history, after I watched it.  This could have been a great movie, with a better lead actor and better writing. As it stands, Ridley Scott failed to return to the success that Gladiator found. Visually, Kingdom of Heaven is a treat. The rest is adequate, at best.",Kingdom of Heaven
75,winner55,great Hollywood epic for the new century,9,20 June 2006,"Probably Ridley Scott's best film. In seeing it a second time, and after listening to interviews with Scott and his cast, the intent, to try to present the events of the film as historically accurate as possible, becomes clear, and helps to explain what at first appears inconsistencies. The cinematography is excellent, the acting is solid, the historical detail work superb. The CGI effects are a bit of a put-off, but I suppose inescapable with a film of this magnitude these days. But to me, the most important aspect of this film is that it really tries to preserve history 0 as so few epics do, these day.Without a history, a people have no culture; in which case they are not a people, but just a ragtail collection of wannabes and hasbeens.",Kingdom of Heaven
76,philip_vanderveken,Killing in the name of . . .,8,6 June 2005,"From the first moment on that I saw the trailer, I knew I wanted to see this film. That I had to wait a couple of months, didn't bother me at all, I had such high expectations of this movie that I was willing to wait even longer. Why, you probably ask yourself. Well, the main reason is because I am a fan of Ridley Scott's work. I loved ""Matchstick Men"" and ""Black Hawk Down"", but it was ""Gladiator"" that swept me completely away. Hoping that ""Kingdom of Heaven"" would be as good as that one, I was willing to wait for it... But the main problem with high expectations is that they are almost never fulfilled. You hope for perfection, but you know that such hopes are nearly impossible. And it's true, ""Kingdom of Heaven"" wasn't perhaps as excellent and perfect as ""Gladiator"", but it certainly was a lot better than average. And there are many reasons for that. Not only were the the direction, the photography, the accuracy of the story and the items that were used,... all very good, so was the acting. Orlando Bloom for instance surprised me. I thought I knew what his acting would be like. It wouldn't be worth much, but because he is the 'newest woman' magnet in Hollywood, no-one would care about that. Well, I'm wrong, he really can act and did a nice job in this movie, although he wasn't as perfect as some might want you to believe. And calling him the biggest revelation of this movie wouldn't be right, that title belongs to Ghassan Massoud. The man is a complete stranger to me and probably to the biggest part of the audience, but he was so convincing and believable as Saladin, that the thought never occurred to me that this was probably the man's very first big role in a movie. Another man that I also really liked was Edward Norton as King Baldwin. You will not see much of him because his face and entire body are covered, but he did such a nice job with that role, that you don't want to see it otherwise.But what struck me perhaps most was the fact that the Muslims weren't depicted as a hoard of bloodthirsty savages who wouldn't like anything more but to butcher the poor and defenseless Christians and to burn that beautiful historical Holy City to the ground. That wouldn't be the truth of course, but how many Hollywood directors would care about that? Not too many and the fact that the Muslims were probably the most advanced people in every possible way at that time, is something that they would rather like to forget, because it doesn't belong in our present image of the world. Today the Muslims are seen as a bunch of retards who don't have anything better to do but to blow themselves up in the name of Allah. 'So why wouldn't they have acted and reacted like that in those days as well?' I almost hear them think, but not Ridley Scott. For him the historical accuracy is holy and I can only applaud him for that. And that accuracy will shine through in every possible aspect of the movie. If you watch the costumes, the buildings, the weaponry,... it all looks like it was made at that time. Once again, I really appreciate that.What might be a drawback for some people, next to the length of the movie, is the excessive violence. Personally I can deal with it and yes, it wasn't a tea party over there either, but I'm afraid that many people will have some difficulties to keep watching when people are killed with burning oil, chopped into peaces with swords and other sharp objects or hit by a dozen arrows. On the other hand, if you know that you will not be able to see such things, choose something else, no-one forces you to watch it of course. But that's not all that made me think, the role of Balian in this movie also raised some questions. At first he is only a poor blacksmith, but than he goes on a crusade, survives a shipwrecking, gets through the desert alive, is immediately accepted by the other knights as the son of Godfrey and fearlessly leads them with no military or strategic knowledge into a battle he can't possibly win. I know this movie is a dramatization, but I don't think that would ever have happened in reality... Still it didn't bother me that much that it would make me hate this movie. It's just something that I noticed. As a conclusion I would like to say that Ridley Scott once set an impossible standard by making ""Gladiator"", but he proves with ""Kingdom of Heaven"" that it is possible to at least near that standard. This is a spectacular movie, with a lot of killing, fighting and violence in the name of God, the king or Allah, but also with an historical background. It shows that extremism and fundamentalism are of all times and that not only the Muslims were the bad guys at those days. It's some solid entertainment and of course there are a lot of dramatizations, but it also gives a good idea of what Jerusalem and the crusades looked like at those days. I give this movie a well deserved 8.5/10.",Kingdom of Heaven
77,bkrauser-81-311064,Severely Underrated Film,7,4 March 2014,"You have to give it up for a director like Ridley Scott. Since the late seventies, Scott has managed to make a handful of contemporary classics that have managed to enhance and elevate the medium of film. Yet for every Blade Runner (1982) there's a mediocre A Good Year (2006); a Prometheus (2012) to every Alien (1979) if you will. So what of his 2005 effort Kingdom of Heaven? Failing to make a killing at the box office, not even reaching its $130 million dollar budget, the question must be asked; is it really that big of a misfire? The answer may surprise.The director's cut of the film challenges its audience to accept a depiction of the crusades that is over three hours long and helmed by a milquetoast Orlando Bloom. Balain, a lowly blacksmith (Bloom) is given the chance to redeem his wife's suicide (among other things) by joining his newly found noble father Godfrey de Ibelin (Liam Neeson) on an odyssey to the Holy Land. The Crusaders plan on making their way to a land where everyone speaks Italian. ""Then keep going until they speak something else."" The journey and destination however is fraught with dangers, seductions and intrigue.While Bloom's command of the movie slips under its lofty premise, the crux of the film remains a testament to Ridley Scott's detailed depictions of history. The same eye he used to recreate the Roman Colosseum in Gladiator (2000) or the Santa Maria in 1492: Conquest of Paradise Scott recreates a stunningly exotic Jerusalem which alone is worth the rental price. While my medieval history is a little rusty, Kingdom of Heaven's 1187 siege of the fabled city is likewise breathtaking and somewhat accurate. There was no mention of selling anyone into slavery after the films impressive climax and I doubt Sibylla Queen of Jeruselem (Eva Green) was that drop dead gorgeous but let's not split hairs here.There are some wildly off the mark portrayals of famous Crusaders yet I doubt Scott was going for imitation. No his, thankfully spiring ambitions go much further than simply putting a history textbook on the screen. Like Karen Armstrong's book ""Holy War"", Scott wants to juxtapose the geopolitical and religious conflicts of the 11th century and those we're faced with today. The movie exposes many conflicting worldviews from the religious tolerance of Messina, the moral torpor of Christian occupied Jerusalem, the absolutism of religious fanatics both Christian and Muslim and the ambitions of the power-hungry.Loyalties are forged for different reasons much like they are in today's world. Yet many times moderation, prudence and compromise are sacrificed in the face of what is politically expedient. In 2005, during the film's release the United States was dealing with sectarian violence in Iraq. Back then there were only hints of our tragic misstep in the region many of us too blinded by our zeal to see the bigger picture. Today Russia is forcing a stand-off in Ukraine upsetting the established peace of Europe. It's politics but its also religious, also personal and also ancient history in repeat. As Balain shouts before the battle ""We fight over and offense we did not give, against those who were not alive to be offended.""Presently do you feel Islamic terrorism is a symptom of a larger economic problem or the subterfuge of millions of years of aggression by outsiders? Do you think the west's emphasis on the region is due to an unquenchable thrust for world domination and influence or misplaced idealistic fervor from centuries past? Your answers to these questions will ultimately inform your perspective on Kingdom of Heaven. Yet while the huddled masses might assume the film is serviceable if overlong and gain no insights from it, others who know their history and their current events will be rewarded by arguably Ridley Scott's most underrated project to date.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",Kingdom of Heaven
78,denis888,Abominable - That's The Description - Updated - Great,9,24 July 2017,"Ridley Scott made an obvious mistake here. I watched this film long time ago. What I got from seeing this drool, was a sour feeling of being bored. My. Three excruciating hours of utter doom. Everything is wrong in this movie -the cast, with Orlando Bloom being the worst offender, and Eva Green little more than an average bore. The setting, with its awful false tonality, epic mediocrity and inescapable feeling of clichés. We saw this all before time and again. Why suffer this horrid boredom-fest, which never rises above dull or gray. My, even such awesome stars as Liam Neeson or Jeremy Irons could be so miserable and so flat as here. Battle scenes? Only if you didn't watch much better Lord Of The Rings fights. Love story. Come on, boring trite banality. On top of that all, terrible plot holes, jumps and a cream of the crop - ;laughable accents that make you cringe.

But you have be 12 years old or younger to appreciate this. The only problem is that even 12-years-olds have seen this just too many times before. Too much sand, too much fire, too much beards, too much Bloom, too much caftans.",Kingdom of Heaven
80,tomsview,Heaven sent,9,30 March 2013,"Until ""Kingdom of Heaven"", films about the crusades were nearly as deadly for filmmakers as the Crusades were for the Crusaders. But Ridley Scott's ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is not only a terrific adventure story but also an intriguing insight into a little-known slice of history. Maybe swords, scimitars and siege towers are not to everyone's taste but there is a lot more to ""Kingdom of Heaven"" than that.Anyone who gets overly stressed about any deviation from historical accuracy should approach this movie with caution. Although the film follows history in broad terms, details were definitely altered. As someone once said, the difference between the movies and real life is that the movies have better writers.Orlando Bloom plays Balian, a blacksmith in a small French village, who is visited by Godfrey of Ibelin, the father he has never met before. Godfrey, played by Liam Neeson, invites Balian to return with him to Jerusalem to eventually inherit lands won in the Crusades. After life in the village becomes untenable, Balian accepts the offer. Although Godfrey leaves the story early, he confers knighthood on Balian, who shows the potential to be a great warrior.After a difficult journey, Balian arrives in Jerusalem, which is in the hands of the Crusaders, and ruled by the leprosy-stricken King Baldwin (Edward Norton), and his right hand man, Tiberius (Jeremy Irons). An uneasy peace is in place between the Crusaders and the Muslims led by Saladin. The King's sister, Princess Sibylla, played by Eva Green, is attracted to Balian and they commence an affair although she is married to Guy de Lusignan, a knight destined to be the next king.When King Baldwin dies, Guy de Lusignan takes the crown and plunges the Crusaders into war with Saladin. The Crusaders suffer a disastrous defeat and Jerusalem is besieged. Balian commands the defence of the city, His heroic stand eventually allows him to arrange lenient terms for the surrender of the city. The Christians withdraw unharmed, and Balian and Sibylla, like many another couple in the centuries to come, retire to the South of France.The film's success hangs on Orlando Bloom's performance. With his fine features and a less than commanding voice, he seems as though he would have trouble cutting through a decent steak let alone hacking his way through a horde of Saracens. However a key element of the story is Balian's growth of character, and Bloom brings a quiet intensity to the role that is very effective. He is believable as a man torn between worldly desires and fulfilling his duty as a knight.The film has a great score by Harry Gregson-Williams, which blends chants and hymns suggestive of Medieval Christianity with the distinctive sounds of the Middle East. Spectacular and epic in scale, ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is a unique movie experience that above all else has a human dimension at its heart.",Kingdom of Heaven

83,xredgarnetx,Interesting if overly long spectacle,6,17 December 2007,"A French blacksmith (Orlando Bloom) finds he is the son of a crusader (Liam Neeson) and follows him into the Holy Land. This is the late 1100s, between the 2nd and 3rd crusades, and an uneasy truce exists between Christians and Muslims. Dad dies, and son becomes an uneasy heir to his lands and title. He makes friends with the king of Jerusalem and his court. At the same time, he is hated by a corrupt knight (Martin Csokas) who wields much influence and is spoiling for a battle with the Muslims. It eventually becomes the young knight's mission to protect Jerusalem. On TV, with commercials, this little ditty took three hours to unspool. As it is, the film is just under 2.5 hours. It is a wonderfully told story, well acted and quite believable, with a huge cast, eye-popping battle scenes and wide desert vistas with Morocco standing in for Jerusalem. Director Ridley Scott takes time to develop this incredible tale. It is a story of great virtue, as imbued in the young knight. The only problem is, it is way too long. This is not LAWRENCE OF ARABIA. Primarily because the beautiful-looking Orlando Bloom is no Peter O'Toole. Bloom is OK, but no charismatic superstar, which this part cried for. I am sorry to note this fizzled at the box office, but I believe it will find new life on television.",Kingdom of Heaven
84,antoniotierno,captivating and fascinating,7,14 May 2005,"When watching a two hours and a half movie you gotta hope it's gonna hold your attention for all the runtime. Well, this movie is a bit slow at times but it never gets you to wait for something to happen; it can also be relevant to our understanding the several nowadays conflicts taking place in the Middle East. I mostly appreciated the great battle scenes with their special effects and I could think the film is breathtaking if we take a look at it on the historical side. One of the best directors of all the times, leaving from an epic and romantic action movie, shows his vision of a fact that helps understanding what's going on in the real world, in a very original way, compared to other Hollywood productions, for its somehow positive portrait of Muslims.",Kingdom of Heaven
85,mstomaso,Well intentioned but a little disappointing,6,13 May 2005,"While I enjoyed this film, and was entertained by it, I have to admit that I was generally disappointed. Orlando Bloom, surrounded by a very impressive cast, stars in this political interpretation of the taking of Jerusalem by Saladin (wonderfully portrayed by Ghassan Massoud). The supporting cast is tremendous. I've already mention Massoud, but I feel that I should also give kudos to Jeremy Irons, Eva Green, Liam Neeson, Marton Csokas and Alexander Siddig for their laudable efforts.Ridley Scott is a master movie maker and almost always excels in direction and cinematography. However, I got the sense that a great deal must have been cut out of the original script - material which might have helped with continuity - perhaps a few years worth of military and hand-to-hand fighting experience on the part of the lead. Also, the slowing and speeding of film in battle scenes has really become a cliché, and no longer has the impact it had in Braveheart, Black Hawk Down, etc. It's time to develop new techniques or go back to the classical methods. Though I am sure some will disagree, as there are certainly some continuity and plot problems in this film (how does Blooms character become a master tactician while floating on a piece of wreckage en route to Jerusalem?, for example), I felt that this had all of the makings of a great film - a compelling subject, a great director, an excellent cast, and a good script.Unfortunately - and I say this with some trepidation because I really like the guy - Orlando Bloom just wasn't the right guy for this role. Perhaps he is simply too young and inexperienced, but I felt that his performance was often two-dimensional and just a little derivative of Viggo Mortenson's Aragorn. Scenes that called for emotion were met with Shakespearean vocalization, but little to no facial expression, and very little body language, and though it was not really the centerpiece of the drama, his relationship with the superb Eva Green was, in fact, more compelling than either the central plot or the heroics and antiheroics of medieval warfare going on around him.This film is worth seeing, if nothing else for the intelligent and understated political messages woven into it. But I think it could have been a much better film than it was.",Kingdom of Heaven
86,mentalcritic,This is what the third Lord Of The Rings film should have been,9,10 May 2005,"Ridley Scott. Love him or leave him, he is an auteur in the truest sense of the word, making films for his artistic satisfaction rather than for the money. Or at least, those are the two motives most directors have for making a film, only in the opposite order. In Kingdom Of Heaven, Scott creates a window into the history of an area that is still fought over today. Only the sophistication of the weapons used has changed. This epic of history is set in the 1180s, when the Crusades were more or less in full swing. The city of Jerusalem, being where Christians allege the central figure of their religion had been born, is the subject of constant battles they instigate. The story begins very quickly as a young blacksmith is talked into service as a Knight, through a series of religious promises. As the Crusaders pour into Jerusalem, political intrigue focusing around a Leper King, his sister, and her lover begins to weaken the power of those occupying the contested city. But where Kingdom Of Heaven really shines is how the climactic battle sequence is realised.In contrast to one certain pretender to the throne, KOH's battles have tactics from both sides that make sense in context of each other. Siege towers are firebombed, boiling oil is poured over siege weapons, then firebombed, and the availability of water is often a deciding factor in which army will emerge victorious. These are the kinds of things that still determine the winner in battles today, so it is nice to see a writer and director acknowledging them. Another area where KOH excels is in the use of confusion. Other films revolving around battle manage to leave the viewer confused, but for no real purpose. In KOH, it helps the viewer to understand how one can put a sword through an ally without realising who they were. Part of this lies in how sparingly the technique of character confusion is used.Orlando Bloom and Brendan Gleeson have worked in the same film before, although they had more on screen time together. That film was a rather jumbled little epic called Troy, and both of their performances had a quality like they were trying to vomit wet socks. Bloom has long been saddled with a reputation as an actor who is more there for his looks than his ability to act, but in KOH, he proves those critics wrong to some extent. When he is called upon to fight toe-to-toe with his on screen opponent, he is able to execute his moves effectively. When he is called upon to emote, or to behave like a leader of warriors, he does so effectively. It is only when he is called upon to act without speaking or with a weapon in his hands that he has a problem. Perhaps if he spends more time in the company of directors like Ridley Scott rather than Peter Jackson or Wolfgang Petersen, he will overcome this problem, too.Of course, not all is perfect in this film. Some sections seem slow in the sense that the pace comes to a bit of a halt. While it is necessary to give a little exposition in order to make the audience care about the characters, there is such a thing as going too slowly. It's not so much that the film's pacing is off, as it is a case of certain scenes not quite having the context to make themselves important enough. According to what I have heard, there are deleted scenes that will eventually make a director's cut. This is hardly surprising, since Ridley Scott originated the commercialised concept of the director's cut when Blade Runner was rereleased in 1992. Although the concept has been run into the ground, with too many films that do not need a director's cut getting one in preference to many that do, this is one film that I would not mind seeing a director's cut for. It would be interesting to see what Scott had to leave out this time, especially after the commercial success of Gladiator.What is interesting to note is that apparently, almost all of the characters depicted here once existed in real life. This puts them somewhat above what half of them were fighting for, but it all seems secondary to the story. Indeed, I doubt you will find a more compelling story within any film released during this year. Given that I had such low expectations for this film, based partly on what others who had seen it told me, this was more than a pleasant surprise. Given that I also saw a Ridley Scott film called Matchstick Men on DVD today, I guess I should have more faith in the man. I certainly will be giving more credit to Orlando Bloom in the future. Keep your eyes peeled, too, for a masked cameo from the King of weird or outlandish roles, Edward Norton. Although his face is never seen in this two-plus hours, he makes a very thankless role his own. The special effects work in this film, as minimal as it is, also happens to be top-notch. Much of it appears to be practical rather than CGI-oriented, although this technique is also used admirably to make arrows fly past the camera.Although Kingdom Of Heaven is not a perfect film, I rated it a nine out of ten. This is much more than I have been rating epic fantasies, or epics revolving around historical battles, as of late. Most of the time, I get the feeling that big-budget epics are overrated on the IMDb. This is one that is underrated. Don't miss it.",Kingdom of Heaven
87,Richie-67-485852,Yes to the Kingdom,10,3 September 2017,"Most satisfying story-telling of a high order presented with class, elegance and professionalism making for excellent viewing while one is glued to the screen. The lead actors play their parts well and the supporting cast along with the many extras go into it so that we would buy the story as presented. The Director gets a serious nod here as this was a film done on epic proportions and grandeur. No easy shoot and a fine addition to Ridley Scotts resume. Overall very impressive and I have seen it three times each time keeping me entertained. There is a directors cut that is worth purchasing for your library that includes quite a bit of footage not seen in the original and adds depth and meaning to movie at large. Location shoots were interesting to watch and I like the little slice of history they carved out here. Saladin is not talked about enough as he was a major player back then in what took place as was King Richard the lion heart and many others. The Christianity presented in this movie was raw, edgy and belligerent something that needs to be told. People forget that the changes Christ talked about come from the realms of Spirit and Truth and not from this world. The Kingdom of Heaven is within you and it will make you in HIS image if activated and pursued. We see otherwise here. Good movie to have a full meal while watching and a tasty drink with snack on standby as it is 2.5 hours and longer for the special cut. Please enjoy this little gem and may it affect you for the better.",Kingdom of Heaven
88,hall895,An epic that's not so epic,6,9 February 2006,"With Kingdom of Heaven, Ridley Scott tried to create a breathtaking epic. He fell short of that mark but did manage to create a pretty decent movie. Set in the time of the Crusades the film deals with the seemingly eternal battle for control of Jerusalem. As the film begins, Christians control the city but Muslims worship there as well as there is a sort of uneasy truce between the two sides. By film's end, the truce is out the window, fireballs are flying through the air and rivers of blood flow through the streets. It's all very cinematic. The visuals are superb, battle scenes brilliantly done, the costumes magnificent...the whole thing is a real wonder to look at. But the film lacks a certain energy driving it forward, taking quite a while to get where it's going. It's a fascinating story, but in the way it is presented it is not always an entertaining one. No matter how wonderful the final battle may be one cannot simply excuse all the lulls in the action we must endure along the way.The central figure in the film is Balian, played by Orlando Bloom. As the film begins Balian is a simple European blacksmith. Soon he will become a knight and eventually the defender of Jerusalem. It's a fascinating character and Bloom gives a fine performance in the role. He is surrounded by an excellent supporting cast, with familiar faces including Liam Neeson, Jeremy Irons and Brendan Gleeson all turning in reliably solid work. Also noteworthy is Edward Norton, playing the leper king Baldwin. Hidden behind a silver mask, Norton still manages to turn in a powerful performance. Lesser-known performers including Marton Csokas, Eva Green (as Balian's obligatory love interest) and Ghassan Massoud (as the powerful and inspiring Muslim leader Saladin) also are top-notch. But still, even with all the great performances, stunning visuals and two fascinating stories (Balian's personal journey and the Christian-Muslim conflict) Kingdom of Heaven seems to be missing something. At times the story drags, at times the story seems to a complete stop. All in all, it's a worthwhile viewing experience but you get the sense it could have been so much more.",Kingdom of Heaven
89,Andy-296,Misguided film doesn't understand the mindset of the crusaders,4,6 January 2007,"A self hate guilt trip, this movie deals with the events surrounding the fall of Jerusalem to Saladin in 1187. I have no problems with the Crusades being told from the Muslim point of view; the problem with this movie is that the Christians are shown as oozing self hate, doubting their mission in the Levant, when in reality, even this late in the Crusades, they deeply believe in the righteousness of their cause (the movie is otherwise relatively accurate in historic terms). Add to that that the action scenes are very poor, that the acting is uniformly bad (Jeremy Irons is particularly terrible, but you can't forget the awfulness of that new invention of the star system, Orlando Bloom, a stand-in for Argentine footballer Ariel Ortega) and you have a very disappointing movie.",Kingdom of Heaven
90,marcin_kukuczka,Kingdom of Heaven = Kingdom of Conscience! Great lesson of universal values!,8,15 May 2005,"""What is Jerusalem worth?"" ""Nothing... Everything!"" There have not been many movies entirely set in the times of crusaders. Since Cecil B DeMille made his medieval epic THE CRUSADES (1935), this topic was only embedded in films about the Middle Ages, like ROBIN HOOD - PRINCE OF THIEVES (1991), some versions of IVANHOE (1952, 1982), and some other American and European movies. This time, however, Ridley Scott sets his story almost entirely in the 12th century Jerusalem, the temporary period of peace between Muslims and Christians broken by irresponsible fanatics. I have not been a particular fan of Ridley Scott, but having seen KINGDOM OF HEAVEN recently, I highly respect his talents. Although the movie is not a pure historical work (tries to generalize the crusades), it is a great film at multiple levels, absolutely comparable in its magnificence to other great productions.It very well shows the reality of the Middle Ages, including people's beliefs and the ideas behind the crusades. The battles are showed realistically, sometimes brutally, but accurately. They are not too long but they memorably leave the gore of war in the viewers. The costumes and sets are really great, which makes the film visually stunning. The medieval atmosphere is, furthermore, intensified by the marvelous music which is something in between the Gregorian chant and the classical music of great composers, like Johann Sebastian Bach.The cast do one of the finest performances I have ever seen in films. I had a very clear and a natural picture of every single character. That's a rare experience to that extend and a real feast for the soul - you watch the movie and you, in your mind, escape to the reality of these events! From famous stars like Jeremy Irons, Liam Neeson to Edward Norton and the youngest ones, including Eva Green and Orlando Bloom ... they all deserve attention. And Ghassan Massoud, who is not famous for playing in many films, gives a wonderful performance of Saladin, stressing his goodness, open heart and a desire for peace.However, except for the things already mentioned, the most important factor for me in this movie is a powerful impact of the characters and their unique psyches. What we notice at first are, in general, the two groups of people: the ones for whom peace, goodness, sacrifice for others, and right deeds are the values they head for in this cruel reality, no matter of religion, race or nationality. It can be said that they are the representatives of Kingdom of Heaven. These are, particularly, King Baldwin IV (Edward Norton), Saladin (Ghassan Massoud), Godfrey (Liam Neeson), and partly Balian (Orlando Bloom). The leper king Baldwin, who has been informed about the danger of breaking peace, does not hesitate to assemble the army and go to the Kerak Castle with peace message. Saladin, in a symbolic scene after the victory over the Christians at the walls of Jerusalem, picks a cross from the floor and puts it on the altar - he does not betray his religion but he does such a right deed as an act of respect. And isn't it better to look for the things that we share instead of the differences among us? The other group are the people whose sole aim in life are selfish desires that lead to war and destruction - Guy Lusignan (Marton Csokas) and Reynald (Brendan Gleeson). Led by Lord Bishop and some of the fanatic Templars in the slogan ""God wants it!"", they lead to war with the Muslims right after the death of the great peacemaker, King Baldwin. Here, the director does justice to history. These were not the representatives of a particular religion that did wrong only, these were various people of different values, as it always is and will forever be...The psychological aspect of the movie cannot be skipped. I think that the message Mr Scott aimed at conveying was that not everyone is ready for right deeds. As the film clearly shows, the kingdom of heaven starts in the hearts of men, this is the kingdom of conscience, the kingdom of reason and heart (that's also partly Christian idea). Only this can lead to stable peace and respect no matter of religion, culture or race. At the beginning of my review, I mentioned the conversation between Saladin and Balian just after the siege of Jerusalem, which was the most memorable moment for me. The kingdom with its walls, wealth and riches is worth nothing, but the kingdom of spirit ... everything (that's how I interpret this).SPOILER: There are, however, some voices that the film shows Christians as worse people than Muslims. I would agree that church hierarchy is showed controversially. There is, indeed, an exaggerated scene when the bishop says that it is better to convert to Islam than renounce the power over Jerusalem. It is true that church hierarchy called for war, for killing the ""infidels"", for condemning people who committed suicide (Balian's wife went to hell according to the priest). But it is hardly probable that bishops encouraged people to convert to Islam. As there were good and bad Muslims, there were good and bad Chritians but most of them retained their religion since the crusades were religious wars, too. But, of course, if a viewer is open minded, this scene will never be a spoiler for him/her. Only people with evil intentions may use these aspects of the movie unjustly against Christianity.In general, the movie is worth attention. It is surely not only another monumental film which does not have much to offer except for some visual effects. It's a great lesson of historical reality, and not only... It's a wonderful lesson of the importance of peace. 8/10",Kingdom of Heaven
91,vitaleralphlouis,Definitely NOT pro-Muslim anti-Christian,7,6 June 2010,"Kingdom of Heaven is a very carefully made historic drama by veteran filmmaker Ridley Scott. Possibly because Mr Scott is over 70 years of age neither this movie (nor 2010's Robin Hood) suffers from the bloated and boring syndrome of almost all post-2000 movies. Mr Scott is a skilled filmmaker.This film offers a fresh take on the Crusades circa 1174. To a greater degree than anything I've seen before, it offers careful reproduction of life and battle in that era. They've gone to a great deal of trouble with this and some of the battle scenes are amazing.The story concerns a young man who seeks redemption for his own grievous sins as weak as those of his late wife by offering his services in the Crusade to free the Christian sites at Jerusalem from the Muslims who control them. There is just so much more to the story than simply having a Christian army pounding at the gates -- so rent the movie and find out.Numerous suggestions on IMDb and elsewhere that the film is anti-Christian, pro-Muslim, etc are just plain lies. The film is very much Christian -- the entire theme is Christian -- yet with historic accuracy it depicts imperfect Christianity and (oh, by the way) the Christians lost the battle. Did anybody expect a quality filmmaker to re-write history? How about Custer defeating the Indians at Little Big Horn, or Germany winning World War II!",Kingdom of Heaven
92,fwomp,Oh Ridley ...I Thought I Knew You.,3,16 January 2006,"KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is an impossible story with a confusing time-line. Balian (Orlando Bloom, PIRATES OF THE Caribbean) is the unlikely hero of Jerusalem during the dark days of the early Christian crusades. Visited by his (up to that point) unknown father (Liam Neeson, KINSEY) shortly after the death of his wife and child, Balian learns that he is the son of a noble Templar Knight.Immediately thrown into their midsts, he learns swordplay ""in the name of God."" His quest, he soon learns, is to protect those within the walls of Jerusalem, even from themselves. When war breaks out amongst a group of Muslim warriors (something that's set up rather slip-shoddily by Brendan Gleeson, COLD MOUNTAIN) and the Christian army gets slaughtered out on the nearby plains, Balian becomes the protector of the city, knighting every able-bodied man willing and able to carry a sword or shoot a bow.Director Ridley Scott (BLADE RUNNER, 1982) gives us an overly-righteous Gladiator flick that has plenty of action but very little substance.The main issues are with historical accuracies (which were apparently thrown to the wind!), character development (shallow!), and a time-line that was impossible to follow.So many things were inaccurate that it's difficult to know where to start. Costumes, the activities of women of the times, the non-punished actions of those who cast-out blasphemy, etc., all made this film completely unbelievable.The characters, many of whom come and go in quick succession, are so underdeveloped that most viewers (at least I didn't) might not give a rat's ass what happens to them.And the time-line. There are no text notifications on the screen to let us know how much time has passed. Balian digs wells with friends and fellow citizens, travels far and wide, sails around the hub of the world, returns to his blacksmith shop, and we have no ideaNO IDEA!how much time has passed.I will say that the action/battle scenes were fairly impressive, but many of these types of combat sequences are becoming passe and even cliché-ish. So nothing new can be credited in this department either.I'm a pretty big fan of Ridley Scott's work, too (I all but gushed over the aforementioned GLADIATOR and BLADE RUNNER, as well as ALIEN, MATCHSTICK MEN, and BLACK HAWK DOWN), but this most certainly isn't up to his normally high standards in my humble opinion.",Kingdom of Heaven
93,KnightsofNi11,Great production value but littered with issues,6,20 June 2012,"Epic medieval set pieces and story lines are nothing new to Ridley Scott because of his wildly successful Gladiator, but just because you can get it right once doesn't necessarily mean you can do it again. Such is the case with Kingdom of Heaven, a medieval action adventure film that isn't as good as Gladiator, but it's no disaster either. Set in the era of the crusades, Kingdom of Heaven stars Orlando Bloom as Balian , a lowly blacksmith who is taken in by the mighty lord Godfrey de Ibelin. For Balian this kicks off a heroic quest to Jerusalem where he must defend the city against Saladin, the Muslim general who hopes to claim the Holy city for his own people. The situation is complicated by impatient lords, kings, and knights, forcing Balian to do all he can to keep the people of the great city safe.Initially, I was not enjoying this film. It starts out very slow and it takes quite a bit of time for it to catch its footing. The characters are introduced poorly and all over the place, making the film difficult to follow and a nuisance to understand. It takes some time to get used to the film's bizarre editing and shaky structure. The film has a major problem with its flow, jumping around from place to place and character to character without hardly any rhyme or reason. It makes for an unpleasant viewing experience, and the first hour of the film is a real hassle.Then, once you manage to get past the sub par editing you are left with a very stale protagonist played by a very wooden Orlando Bloom. This is something I did not get used to and I can assure any viewer that the film would have been much better off with somebody else filling this role. The character of Balian is nothing more than a heroic pretty boy who lines up perfectly with all of the ideal hero stereotypes. He is valiant, just, intelligent, and fair. There's no real appeal to the character and Orlando Bloom brings no life to him. It shows definite room for improvement.But what I can commend Kingdom of Heaven on is its production value. It's a sweeping epic with fantastic set pieces, elaborate costumes, and a cavalcade of extras which make the film's armies seem absolutely magnificent. Ridley Scott puts his heart and soul into shooting the battle sequences and he certainly delivers. The final battle of the film is Balian's last stand at Jerusalem against the mighty and ominous army of Saladin, and it is a battle that does not leave you wanting more. It is incredible to watch and, no matter how many problems I could list with the rest of the film, I cannot deny that it is just simply awesome and really makes Kingdom of Heaven worth the watch. If you have the ability to sit through a two and a half hour movie, use it and enjoy Kingdom of Heaven for all its grandeur and explosive excitement. It's a film that certainly has its fair share of issues, but things more or less pay off by the end.",Kingdom of Heaven
94,Holt344,Director's Cut of Kingdom of Heaven is visually stunning and a superb film,10,8 February 2020,"Kingdom of Heaven, Ridley Scott's epic historical film that many found bad with the theatrical cut myself have never seen it but I went straight to the Director's Cut which is the definitive version and I agree. The whole production is massive and impressive, cinematography and the direction of Ridley Scott makes every scene visually stunning, making every scene stand out with expensive and incredible sets. It didn't take long for me to get immersed into the 12th Century and Balian's adventure to Jerusalem as it felt that I was there with them. Now this movie isn't for anyone as it's over three hours long but I found it amazing from start to finish and my interest with that period of time, the medieval times helped a lot. For me it's a masterpiece in its genre, the Director's Cut that is.The ensemble cast is massive and the cast who plays the respective characters all do an excellent job, bringing the characters to justice and their best to portray the real people behind the characters. What I loved is that every character isn't black and white, there's lots of grey characters that you can't really place in any category of evil or good. Orlando Bloom does a great job in leading the movie as we see it mostly from his eyes, the big names around him makes it the fantastic ensemble they are.
The costume and prop department are one of the best things about the movie as without it, it wouldn't really feel immersive or realistic but what we got was a impressive amount of swords, flags, costumes and armor and when they wear the costumes and swords they become the characters.",Kingdom of Heaven

Story is not ever cringing as is the case with most historical movies, but this film rather allows the viewer to form their impressions of what the crusades were truly by the politics, greed and naivety that abounds in the characters in the movie.the acting is generally very good, with Bloom removing his boyish charm looks for the role, whilst Jeremy Irons just steals every scene he is in (a great great actor).I'd recommend this movie, don't expect Lord of the Rings battles, as the movie is brutal but does not take an action line to bring its points across. Enjoy while you can...",Kingdom of Heaven
97,Danusha_Goska,Emasculated and Lobotomized by PC & FX,1,12 May 2005,"Let's get this out of the way right up front: Ridley Scott's ""Kingdom of Heaven"" stinks. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, in any category. In spite of its well-earned bad reviews, I went to enjoy the spectacle. Mistake. You could get more Medieval spectacle by flipping through an illustrated children's book about the Middle Ages. Or, you could watch a decent movie set in the same era, from ""Becket"" to ""El Cid"" to ""The Adventures of Robin Hood."" Heck, you could watch Monty Python's ""Spamalot."" ""Kingdom of Heaven"" was lobotomized and emasculated by Political Correctness and Special Effects. The movie is so diluted by its own wishy-washy Political Correctness that it doesn't even have narrative drive.There is no side to route for, no character pursuing a long-term goal, no big idea being fought over. All that blood and sand and buckled swash of the Crusades v. the Islamic Jihad, was over nothing more important than Orlando Bloom's good looks.This complete lack of a point doesn't just make the movie mind- and butt-numbingly boring, it also makes it ironic. If nothing else, people on both sides - both Crusaders and Jihadis - *believed* in what they were doing. To make a movie about this conflict in which no one believes in anything is to make a movie about high fashion in which there are no skinny women. It's completely pointless.This would have been a much better movie if Scott had had the b----s to pick a side, any side, and present it, in all its fire-breathing passion and wrong-headed intensity. I wouldn't have cared if he had picked the Crusaders' side or the Jihadis' side.I can't help but compare this film to Oliver Hirschbiegel's ""Downfall,"" a movie about Hitler's final days, or even Leni Riefenstahl's ""Triumph of the Will."" Both films feature heinous characters, like Hitler and Goebbels, who believe a vile philosophy. Both are excellent films. That both films present a point of view - even a completely wrong point of view - in all its intensity gives the viewer much to think about, and could be used to contribute to ethical debate.""Kingdom of Heaven's"" plot is ridiculous. One example: leaders choose to keep a very bad man alive, knowing that this very bad man will lead to a bloodbath of the entire city of Jerusalem, just because a former blacksmith tells them not to kill him. Huh? Orlando Bloom, Liam Neeson, David Thewlis and Jeremy Irons are completely wasted. Ridley Scott should have to convert to Catholicism just so he can confess his sins against these fine actors.Ghassan Massoud, as Saladin, alone has enough charisma to shine. Aroused audience awareness of him may be the only good thing to come from ""Kingdom of Heaven."" The movie drags, drifts, and then falls flat. When you're yawning and looking at your watch during a violent siege that's a very bad sign. There are lots of pretty costumes and sets, but nothing happens in them, so, who cares? As many male viewers commented, at least in Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" you got to see Rosario Dawson's naked chest.Just one example of how dumb this movie is. In a field of corpses, thousands of obviously computer-generated vultures feed. Two problems - they have the profiles of bats, not vultures. Bats are mammals, you see. And these ""vultures"" make the sounds of migrating cranes. Cranes eat frogs, insects, seeds, and berries, *not* human flesh. Throughout that whole scene, I could hardly keep from laughing. Not the correct reaction to a scene of carnage.Not many people would know that that was the sound of cranes, you say? Well, is that the kind of intellectual integrity you want in a movie about conflict between Christians and Muslims, especially in an era when this conflict is still very much alive? ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is simple-minded in its Politically Correct hatred of Christians and Christianity, and its elevation of Islam above all criticism. That's not what makes it a bad movie, though. For what makes it a bad movie, see above.In any case, the filmmaker's arrogance shines through his PC. In laughable scenes, a European blacksmith teaches ignorant Middle Easterners about *wells*, so that they will have water. This motif reflects the narrative of Israel ""making the desert bloom."" Good grief. Are we to believe that people in the Middle East didn't know what wells were till reluctant Crusader Orlando Bloom arrived? And, if that's true, wouldn't that ultimately make the Crusades a very good thing? You had a lot of thirsty people till 1187.",Kingdom of Heaven
98,russem31,Average,7,22 January 2006,"Kingdom of Heaven is all in all a very average film, definitely not on par with the spectacular Gladiator film, both directed by master director Ridley Scott. In fact, he tries to recreate Gladiator, with a husband who again lost his wife and child (instead of Russell Crowe, who had presence, we have Orlando Bloom - who isn't BAD in the role but isn't spectacular either). The story is really just a slice of life, as we go through Bloom's journey from France to Jerusalem where he can find peace from his sins, as he sees it. The real problem with this film, is that where in Gladiator, I felt for Crowe's character (among others in that film), I really don't have any attachment to any of the characters here. The only real asset I see is the production value, especially the castle of Jerusalem. Now that is a spectacular sight. Overall, a 6 out of 10.",Kingdom of Heaven
99,jpschapira,I guess Scott's done it again...,8,30 May 2005,"When a movie starts and there is a calmed environment, with people you figure out you'll get to know later, and it's followed by a battle scene (but not a big one), backed up with unique music and visual style that makes you feel in the time where the story is being told, you know you are in Ridley Scott's territory. There are some things that can only be realized by one person; Scott is an expert in his subject. ""An epic of this magnitude, with a genius like Ridley at the helmIs big"", said Janty Yates. So big that Scott has hired most of his old team workers back, to achieve what they did some years ago with ""Gladiator"". I had to bring that up, because there are a lot of similarities between both movies; the beginning, the few but comforting battles, the special effects, the costumes that resemble the period perfectly, the amazing locations, the dramatic power And the same results will possibly occur, because ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is Oscar-quality. It contains a hidden and little human message, it makes most of his cast shine, it is one of those mega productions that accomplish something more than ordinary entertainment.However, the movie didn't live up to the greatness of ""Gladiator"" in all its aspects. I was really looking forward to see it, and I wasn't disappointed, but ""Gladiator"" is between my favorite films and has some things this movie lacks. I'm not going to start about the good and the bad aspects between these two Scott's films because it would take long; ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is a movie of its own. It's a beautifully constructed and shot piece. It deals with a variety of elements that complement with the film's focus. It deals with death and what it means to someone when he is told: ""You're walking to a certain death"", and he answers: ""Every death is certain"".It deals with religion in its deepest parts and how some men take it; essential. They need God's trust, and you understand when one man says to another: ""May God be with youHe has abandoned me already"". This because that man was ashamed of finding he fought for land and money, when he believed those fights where for God. And all these other sayings, as how bad it can be that a man is not known by God, and how everything is determined by Him (""God wills it""). Let's not forget that everything happens in Jerusalem; and that it is the ""kingdom of heaven"", where god must be worshipped, no matter who does it (Muslims, Christians), and where anyone can find forgiveness. It deals with love, in the way it must have been at that time, where women couldn't choose the man they would marry and had two faces; the public and the private. This plot was developed and written by first-time screenwriter William Monahan, and he carried it subtly, but not seriously enough to generate what the movie was trying to achieve. I can't even imagine how his writing arrived at 260 pages, when the characters barely speak. This aspect is clever, though, because it lets us imagine how the things were really managed in some aspects; war, assassination. Everyone speaks clearly, but shortly, delivering important instructions in five words. When Guy (Marton Csokas) has a problem with a man, he recurs to Reynald (Brendan Gleeson); who makes it look so easy, saying: ""Yes. Balian. Celebrated. Kill Him."" This and other short expressions all over the script of a deep movieI hadn't said deep, because I've heard from respected critics that the movie is deep, about human emotions. But this is not something present in the screenplay; because the deepness of the movie lies not in what the characters say, but in the message it wants to leaveA message you'll only catch if you pay close attention. One person told me that the movie left him wondering if the events had really happened. In ""Kingdom of Heaven"", as in ""Gladiator"", it didn't matter to me, because real or not, the films caused me an impression.The ones that bring a screenplay to life are the actors. I start from Orlando Bloom (Balian), who has had the luck of being in the right places at the right times. First in ""The Lord of the Rings"", with his Legolas, where he was known because of the phenomenon; then, in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", with Johnny Depp by his side; and last in the super production that was ""Troy"". Unfortunately, we find him in the same situation here; and he still hasn't impressed me (neither as a blacksmith, nor as a knight). Eva Green (Sibylla) has a special beauty, and hides acting gifts she won't be able to show in a movie like this; but you know it's all there. Supporting characters are very important in these movies, and Jeremy Irons' Tiberias is the best of the film. In a superb interpretation, I must say that supporting performances don't get as good at Iron's age as this one. The other highlight is Brendan Gleeson's Reynald, with a lot of personality and fun in his scenes. Liam Neeson shines in his short participation as Godfrey, Edward Norton hides spectacularly behind the King's maskAn entire perfect ensemble.This is just the way I like to watch heroes, where they are so different and unique in their humility. In ""Gladiator"", Maximus is loved and destined for greater things, but he is just a gladiator. In ""Kingdom of Heaven"", after Balian does the great things he does, and some men arrive looking for ""Balian, the man who saved Jerusalem"", he replies: ""I'm just the blacksmith"".",Kingdom of Heaven
100,EijnarAmadeus,May thy kingdom come,7,11 May 2005,"THE LAST SAMURAI, GLADIATOR, Alexander, KING ARTHUR and TROY - all epic war-fares that tries going over the top on each other. With Ridley Scott's latest feature, Orlando Bloom stars this epic tale and with more confidence than in a long time, Ridley Scott ignites a huge movie and makes it very good.KINGDOM OF HEAVEN makes Orlando Bloom stepping forward again as a actor, doing a good performance as Balian, he and the rest of the cast all do great performances. Shot in Marocco, the film is set in a desert alike location where Orlando Bloom and the rest of his men fight for Jerusalem. Liam Neeson playing his father, Jeremy Irons acting as the King of Jerusalem's counselor, Edward Norton playing the crippled King (though we never see Edward's face) and more good actors.Brilliant battle sequences, especially put weight on the finale act, KINGDOM OF HEAVEN surely is bombastic and puts it's moves on the right places. Though it may not have the bloodshot brutality and fascination of Alexander, it has a even more interesting plot, though these two movies goes draw on very many of the levels. Oliver Stone and Ridley Scott is just a matter of taste, though I would have voted for the first one though, and both have fantastic photo. Colin Farrell actually isn't the killer that Bloom tries being, though maybe it should have been the other way. Orlando Bloom does surprisingly well, acting very convincing and fitting in the part as a Christian crusader that's set off by his father.KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is one of this year's biggest movie moments, though it may seem a bit rushed in the start the movie always keeps popping up with interesting bits and grows bigger and better as the minutes roll.",Kingdom of Heaven
101,grahamsj3,"Not bad, not bad at all",8,1 November 2005,"This is a highly dramatized story of the early Christian crusades against the locals, who happen to all be Muslims. Much of the story occurs in Jerusalem or thereabouts. It's the story of Balian, defender of Jerusalem and it's more or less true. I haven't read a whole lot about him, but I understand the basic premise of the film is pretty much true. Orlando Bloom stars as Balian, but I believe he was miscast. He was good as Paris in Troy and a good Elf in the Rings, but somehow just didn't seem to really belong in this film. Maybe his heart wasn't in it or something. Anyway, the remainder of the cast carry the film well. Mention must be made that the film shows Christians to be much more fanatical than the Muslims. The Muslims seem to be the voice of reason while most of the Christians just want to kill all the Muslims they can. I'm sure there was fanaticism and reason on both sides. Since I wasn't there (or was I?), I am unable to address the question of the handling of both sides.

Subject itself is touchy and problematic, since there are still problems coming from the East, like present day wars in Sirya and Iraq, also ISIL becoming a new phenomena, has to do something with it.Those were the glorious times. Knights, chivalry and a lots of blood spilled over who has the right to own the Holy land. Muslims or the Christians? Acting is excellent. Plot is interesting, although from time to time we are left with certain holes in the plot. We are not sure what is happening in certain parts of the film, however as a whole film is excellent.

103,jdkraus,A Final Dream: The Director's Cut,10,29 May 2006,"The theatrical version was adequate, but lacked the character development that was deeply needed, and the storyline was rather drifting and choppy. However, after seeing the director's cut: I have to admit now that i really like this film now.The director's cut adds an additional fifty minutes to the movie, but all fifty minutes are necessary. The added scenes in this movie, first off I should say, develops the characters in story much better. there is an emotional impact now in the film with believable and likable characters. Orlando Bloom as Balian prevailed and did a heck of a job in this film, as did Eva Green, Liam Neeson, for those who are his fans, he is in the film more by at least fifteen minutes, revealing more about his life and motives, and the others excelled even better than the original cut.We get to learn more about these characters, and their motives that drive them to do the things they did which were at most implied in the theatrical cut. Now, the storyline changes a bit, adding much more dialogue including the story of Sybilla having a son whose heir to the throne, and his bitter fate, which foreshadows to Sybilla's insanity. the film also explores more of Balian's viewpoint on religion, which is a strong significance to his side f the story, including flashbacks of his wife. Overall, the story is more visual and more understood and explained, leaving no plot holes like the theatrical did.The film carries the same moral lesson and story, but it only brightens and makes it all the more believable. the settings are enhanced, the costumes are glamorous, the cinematography by John Mathieson is superb, and harry Gregson-Williams score is longer and more flowing in the story and with the characters.I have to warn those who are squeamish that this film is far more violent than the theatrical. there's plenty of blood spurting and sprays and some other nasty detail including: a man getting sliced in half and some extended be-headings, including Reynald's which was left implied in the original cut. if you can't handle blood, this is not for you. But I also have to admit that the battles are not extended hardly at all, maybe some blood added here and there in killings but that is all.The director's cut is truly an epic that the film was meant to be. it has everything it needs to carry out for a great film. 5/5 Congrates to Ridley Scott for releasing this new feat!",Kingdom of Heaven
104,FloatingOpera7,A Movie Better Suited Before 9/11,4,20 June 2005,"Ridley Scott is a brilliant director of historic epics, usually about a male hero who overcomes himself and greater odds. Gladiator, which won Best Picture and was one heck of a role for Russell Crowe, was his best film. As a follow-up to that film, this movie is on a large scale- epic panoramas of battles scenes, medieval life during the Crusades, Jerusalem, the conflict between Christians and Muslims, historic characters like the leper king and Saladin. But to be honest, despite the grandeur of it all, this movie is extremely violent and very inappropriate to our time. After 9/11 or even before, it would seem that Muslims and Christians (some people not everyone) would want to see such a terrible Crusade and conflict break out again in our own time. Radical Christians and radical Muslims are themselves fighting already, at least verbally. This film, which depicts Christians demanding the blood of Muslims, is very offensive to both Christians and Muslims. The whole thing was bloody, and extremely violent. I wasn't expecting that much violence. I remember someone sitting behind me during the film actually ENJOYING the bloodshed and making war cries himself. I felt this film was not good at all. But if you're a fan of Ridley Scott, Orlando Bloom (trying to do a more macho character)and the incomparable Liam Neeson- then this movie is for you. But it was not a movie for me at all. Even Troy with Brad Pitt was better.",Kingdom of Heaven
105,Prichards12345,Enjoyable and entertaining.,7,18 September 2010,"Granted there are some plot holes and silly bits, but for me this was a better movie than the much touted Gladiator, which was WHOLLY unbelievable and redeemed only by good acting and directing. Bloom gets his fair share of stick, but I thought he was quite good in this - at least he isn't a pompous git like Russell Crowe....Director Ridley Scott assembles a top notch cast for this tale of a blacksmith's adventures in the Holy Land (it helps if your Dad is a knight of the realm and promptly snuffs it so you can take over his lands) Liam Neeson has his usual ""Instruct the hero before croaking"" role, but I liked Eva Green's darkly mysterious princess, David Thewlis is his old dependable self, and it's great to see Jon Finch pop up in the latter part of the movie. Everything looks terrific (as you'd expect from this director) and there's a Two Towers-style battle at the end. I haven't seen the director's cut yet - I'm basing this review on the 138 minute version.The heart of the movie is really a plea for religious tolerance, the end title card nicely hammering home the point without preaching. Some of the plot is maybe stretching it a bit (Bloom and a horse are the only ship wreck survivors - that's handy!) but I enjoyed the movie as a whole. Scott is certainly a brave guy post 911 to make his Muslim leaders noble and decent. All kudos to him!",Kingdom of Heaven
106,bopdog,"Ambitious, but failed. Good historical vibes, but inexplicably mixed with an annoying Boy Band hero and girlie fantasy romance. Wait for the DVD.",5,8 May 2005,"This movie suffers from being unsure as to what, exactly, it is about. Is it an historical drama? Is it an adventure? Or is it a chick-flick romance? Unfortunately, it does the history and the adventure really well, but the girlie bits are very annoying, as those do not match-up with the 'realistic' themes of history.I enjoyed the realistic depiction of medieval Britain and the Middle East. But what was up with the hero's hair? No matter what was going on, Orlando Bloom always had this sissy coif, in perfect array. His pompadour and 'product laden' locks were out of place with the other actors, who looked more like the real folks we see in the old paintings and tapestries from the era. The other actors looked more in keeping with what we might guess folks who never bathed might look like. True, Bloom got muddy once, but for the most part he looked like a maturing ex-member of a Boy-Band--- A housewife's fantasy of what a knight and hero should look like when he gallantly strikes pose after pose on horseback, dashing through the forest, or the desert, or in battle.Bloom also resembled a male model--- like some over-paid underwear model, he was always pouting. Yuchhhh! I wanted to reach up into the screen and smack that pouty smirk off his face, and tell him to be a man.Overall, I must admire the director's intentions, and much of his efforts did pay off. But, sadly, the stupid and artificial insertion of the girlie themes was enough to spoil the whole effect. I think this movie would probably be a lot easier to take once it comes out on DVD, and one can watch it on telly--- the fake hair dos and corny posturing will be less evident on the tiny screen. And, you can pop to the kitchen for a bacon sanny while the old lady swoons during the soppy bits.",Kingdom of Heaven

A blacksmith named Balian has lost his family and nearly his faith. The religious wars raging in the far-off Holy Land seem remote to him , yet he is pulled into that immense drama. Amid the pageantry and intrigues of medieval Jerusalem he falls in love, grows into a leader, and ultimately uses all his courage and skill to defend the city against staggering odds. Destiny comes seeking Balian in the form of a great knight,Godfrey of Ibelin, a Crusader briefly home to France from fighting in the East. Revealing himself as Balian's father, Godfrey shows him the true meaning of knighthood and take s him on a journey across continents to the fabled Holy City. In Jerusalem at that moment--between the Second and Third Crusades--a fragile peace prevails, through the efforts of its enlightened Christian king, Baldwin IV, aided by his adviser Tiberias, and the military Clearly, director Ridley Scott does not agree with the above somewhat simplified . In ""Kingdom of Heaven"", wars and battles are fueled by an assortment of motivations including land, money, political consideration, natural desire for violence, lust for fame, love of the common people, among others. Even more importantly, this ""idea"" thing does not prevent leaders from practicing tolerance, reaching compromises and even recognizing equality with alien faiths, as the movie tries to show us. .It's difficult to refrain from comparing the attack of Jerusalem with the attack of Minas Tirith, and this very comparison can be construed as an unreserved compliment on Kingdom of Heaven.Another comparison that can be made is the depiction of a mighty army, done so unimaginatively in two similar movies last year. In Kingdom of Heaven,we see first a solitary figure on horseback at a distant mountain gap. ""Saladin's army of 200 thousand is here"" says Balian. ""There's only one person"", comes the reply from a follower. ""No, they're all here"" Balian quietly responses, at which point the angle of the camera starts to rise, first revealing the patch behind the mountain gap, filled with soldiers. Then, as the horizon of our vision continues to extend, layers of mountains and vales continue to appear, together with Saladin's mighty army deployed in an apparently haphazard, but ultimately strategic fashion. This must be seen to appreciate. Of the cast, I must first mention Edward Norton. As the leper king of Jerusalem, he appears all the time behind a mask which covers his entire face, showing only his eyes with disfigured corners. But it's the voice that is so mesmerizing. Ever since Fight Club, Norton's voice has such a timbre that soft as he sounds, there are lurking behind tantalizing hints of subtlety, intrigue, compassion,power, and twenty other different and conflicting emotions all at once.. Liam Neeson and Jeremy Irons, playing father and mentor respectively, do not exactly have the most challenging parts in their careers.Eva Green retains the girlish defiance in The Dreamer, but adds to it the maturity and allure required for the role of Sibylla (as portrayed by the script, but not necessarily as recorded in history).And there is good old Brendan Gleeson, in the customary role of big bully fighter which he has perfected in Gangs of New York and Troy.

110,Mr_Sensitive,Badly Written Screenplay Distroy Whole Movie,5,10 November 2006,"This got to be one of the worst ever written screenplay for an epic movie. I'm so disappointed that Ridley has chosen this movie to work with, with his caliber he should have know very well how badly written the story is.Synopsis: Balian and his estrange father set out to Jerusalem during the Crusade in the 12th century to wash off the sin they've committed. Along the way they faces many problem and finally found himself as a defender to the great city.Don't want to say this but the screenplay is really horrendous. Despite the movie is over two hours long everything seems so brief and cut into chase to the point that you'll say, ""what the hell is going on?"" The character is shallow and the situation is of sudden. The story is full of flaws: example. After one class of sward fighting Balian find him master at it and able to take on the whole Jerusalem army???? The subplot is nothing but an excused to have some sex scene. And the dialog is awful and uninspiring. And the scores are not good.What save the film from failing incredibly is the work of Ridley, the set of the movie is awesome and epic looking and the costume is very nice. Plus some of the battle scenes are all right. The editing is still suck big time though, almost as bad as screenplay.I must admit Orlando isn't all-bad at least you won't get distracted by his women like face. But still he is not as manly enough as Russell Crows, so I think the movie could have done better with other actor.Lastly: The movie is save because of the big name director and actors otherwise I think it will definitely be just a complete trash.Reason To Watch: Because it is a Ridley Scott film.Reason Not To: One of the worst screenplays for an epic movie.Rating: 5/10 (Grade: D-)",Kingdom of Heaven
111,cariart,"Rousing, Yet Intimate Tale of Crusades...",9,19 October 2005,"Ridley Scott's masterful follow-up to ""Gladiator"", ""Kingdom of Heaven"", is, certainly, the best film about the Crusades ever made. While this may seem faint praise about an era far removed from ours, his vision offers an honesty and timeliness that clearly illustrates how little has changed in the last thousand years. With remarkable fidelity to actual characters and events, ""Kingdom"" reminds viewers that goodness is not only a Christian attribute (Ghassan Massoud's Saladin is far more sympathetic and compassionate than many 'holy' Crusaders), that even an average man, given purpose, can change the world (Orlando Bloom's Balian, a grieving blacksmith, discovers his father is a Baron, embraces the code of chivalry, and ultimately saves Jerusalem from total destruction), and that religious atrocities ""in the name of God"" was as ridiculous then as it is, today.While there are many historical inaccuracies, for cinematic purposes (Godfrey and Balian were not related, Balian was far older than Bloom, did not have a love affair with Sibylla, etc.), director Scott unflinchingly shows much that was true (Jerusalem's 'King' Baldwin...a masked Edward Norton...dying from leprosy; the horrific siege of the city), and fills the screen with such detail that the film demands repeated viewings, to truly appreciate the spectacle.Several performances deserve mention; Orlando Bloom shows a previously untapped range as the central character, Balian, in certainly his best performance to date; Brendan Gleeson, as the bigoted Reynald, makes the character nearly as unsavory as the ACTUAL Reynald; Jeremy Irons is wonderful as the fictional Tiberias (based on the historic Raymond of Cyprus...Tiberias DOES have a nobler ring!), David Thewlis' 'Hospitaler' shows a common sense and faith sadly lacking in his more demonstrative peers; and Liam Neeson, in a role FAR too brief, gives Godfrey both humanity and nobility (although he seems to be making a career of playing hero's mentors!) While I have some quibbles (although most of the story is set in Jerusalem, the Jewish population is nearly completely ignored), I have to admire the richness of detail, the huge scope, and humanity Ridley Scott gives the project. The film's failure at the box office was, to me, more a problem of topic than execution, and that's a shame; the parallels between the troubled Middle East of the Middle Ages and today is a sad testimony of history repeating itself, yet again.""Kingdom of Heaven"" is a remarkable film!",Kingdom of Heaven

Because there are more similarities between ""Gladiator"" and this movie besides having the same director.What struck me first about this movie was the visual style. Ridley Scott is just one of the best directors right now when it comes to this. Every shot feels thought-through, every color balanced. Most of the time though he still manages to avoid the clinical style of many other directors focused on visuals. ""Gladiator"" felt somewhat artificial to me when i watched it the first time around, and even more so when watching it on DVD. Many of the special effects-shots are simply not that well-made. ""Kingdom of Heaven"" though takes full opportunity of the advancements made in technology. The movie looks awesome to say the least.The script is no revolution of coherence or cohesion, yet it works rather well for this type of movie. Because this is more pure entertainment than anything else. In the press material Ridley Scott stated himself that this should be seen more as entertainment than historical facts. Which is absolutely fine by me i might add, at least as long as he states this beforehand. Perhaps the most disturbing things is for instance the way that Orlando Bloom goes from clueless blacksmith to full-fledged sword-wielding knight in 15 minutes movie-time.And the actors? Orlando Bloom is in my opinion one of the most over-rated actors around today. Here though he's better than i've seen him before. I think the main thing is that he manages to act and look more like an adult this time, while in most previous movies he has felt almost childish. The rest of the cast consist mostly of quite well-known names and they all do a fine job, making this movie quite well-acted although it's not exactly Shakespeare...All things said and done i found this movie to be very entertaining. It's visually stunning, reasonably well acted with a decent script and some nice characters. What it lacks in coherence and story it makes up for with a strong and quick pace (for the genre) and some truly impressive action scenes. Wolfgang Petersson and Oliver Stone should watch this before they even think of making another historic epic. Because Ridley Scott has learned the important lesson so well put in ""Gladiator"": the people want to be entertained! I rate this 7/10.",Kingdom of Heaven
114,EmperorNortonII,Kingdom of Heaven: A Crusades Story For Our Time,7,15 June 2005,"""Kingdom of Heaven"" is a story set in the year 1184, during the Crusades. With today's tensions in the Middle East, such a subject can be very touchy. But the story was handled fairly, not assigning the ""hero"" role to the Christians and the ""villain"" role to the Moslems. Truth be told, the Crusaders were mostly fortune hunters who invaded the Holy Land under the guide of reclaiming it for Christians. Saladin, the Saracen leader played by Syrian actor Ghassan Massoud, is portrayed as a tough but noble Moslem. Orlando Bloom plays the lead well as gentlemanly Crusader Ballian. The best parts of the movie were the fine costumes and emblems of the knights' shields and the Saracens' banners. While no Crusades story can tell the whole truth, ""Kingdom of Heaven"" offers one with less bias than one of earlier years.",Kingdom of Heaven
115,apryla-58795,And to think...this was the shortened version!,5,21 October 2019,This was so long and boring. All I took away from it is that Orlando Bloom was hot back then. This is an important story to tell but dang! Make it interesting. The fighting towards the end when the Muslims were taking back Jerusalem from the Christians went on for so long I was fast forwarding to get through it and even doing that it felt too long. Many people are not that well versed in the crusades so any movie that has that as the main focus needs to also try to educate the audience otherwise you'll lose them. This was just one long scene after the next. Too much to put into one movie. We need more backstory to get invested. I rarely stop watching a movie once I start one so I have to give myself credit for sticking with this BUT I did fast forward in a few places. This just seemed interminable. There are other movies out there than clock in at 3 hours but they are so good and engrossing it doesn't seem like it. This was not one of those movies. There were many elements that were good but Ridley Scott tried to put too much in one movie. It just didn't work for me.,Kingdom of Heaven
116,the-movie-guy,Location shots and battle scene special effects were great,8,5 May 2005,"The story begins in the year 1184 during the time of the Crusades for the city of Jerusalem. Balian, (Orlando Bloom), a peasant blacksmith in France is visited by Godfrey of Ibelin (Liam Neeson). Godfrey reveals to Balian that he is his father, and he asks Balian to come with him and fight in the Crusades. Balian tells his father that he is mourning his wife, who has just committed suicide after the death of their baby just after birth. Balian ignores Godfrey's invitation to fight in the Crusades. The village priest now tells Balian that his wife's soul is in hell because of her action, and that she is in hell without a head because he cut it off. Balian kills the priest, and then rides out of town towards his father's knights. Several of Godfrey's knights are killed, and Godfrey is gravely wounded while saving Balian from French authorities who were trying to arrest him. Balian chooses now to go on the Crusades with his father. Balian is knighted by his father, and he gives him his title of Baron of Ibelin. Balian has lost his faith, but he still goes to Jerusalem to seek forgiveness for his wife. Balian visits the place where Christ was crucified, and he asks God, ""What do you want me to do""? Balian begins to experience a spiritual journey to restore his faith. The truce between the King of Jerusalem and the Muslims is broken, and the Muslin army lead by Saladin (Ghassan Massoud) attacks the city. Balian and the people of Jerusalem fight for their lives.The location shots and the battle scene special effects were great. You almost get too close to the action when the knights are fighting hand to hand. You will see the senseless brutality of war. You will also see how a small village blacksmith can rise to the occasion and save a city from certain destruction. Note: The storyline does not follow history, so students shouldn't write a book report based on the movie. (20th Century Fox, Run time 2:25, Rated R) (8/10)",Kingdom of Heaven
117,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,6 March 2019,"The stage curtains open ...A complete surprise - not what I expected. One of those movies that builds you into a slow capture. But once they have you hooked, you are definitely hooked.Finding a reason to hold on after the suicide death of his wife, Balian (Orlando Bloom) , a village blacksmith, is visited one day by a traveler named Godfrey (Liam Neeson), a man claiming to be his father. At first, he spurns him and turns him away. But after Balian kills the village priest for having his wife beheaded in death (because she was a suicide), he rides out to meet Godfrey who is headed to the holy land. It is the story of a blacksmith who became the savior of the people of Jerusalem despite and against impossible odds. It is a love story as well, between Balian and the Sibylla, the Queen of Jerusalem.This is a very good movie with sweeping landscapes, incredible cinematography and strong characters. Orlando Bloom's acting was spot on here - going from a content and quiet life as a blacksmith to a leader of war. But, he was never over-the-top or unrealistic in his portrayal - nothing ""grand"" or ""majestic"". He was a good man with good morals - and even as the leader who would defy great odds, he was still quiet in his ways, yet effective. The battle scenes, in particular the siege of Jerusalem, were jaw dropping and that is where the strength of this movie is - along with the underlying musical score, which was very well done.I would recommend this movie highly. It starts slow and builds - but the scenes are all very well crafted and filmed. I loved ""Kingdom of Heaven"" - it is a film of majesty. It's a part of my own personal collection and I will watch it again down the road.",Kingdom of Heaven
118,MichaelMargetis,Ridley Scott's Action-Packed Crusades Epic,7,7 May 2005,"Tis the summer movie season, and it just started this week. The first week of May always starts the summer off with a bang. This time around, the bang is 'Kingdom of Heaven', the big, loud and expensive historical epic from 'Gladiator' director Ridley Scott. I had a few reservations about this Crusades flick, mostly because in the commercials for it they had this Generation-X heavy metal music in the background. But, the commercials deceive you that way. They actually don't have any (I repeat, any) modern music in 'Kingdom of Heaven' and that's definitely a plus. I knew 'Kingdom of Heaven' wasn't going to be a great movie, but what I got out of it was a very good movie (instead of the so-so kind of movie I was sadly expecting.) This film has some excellent action and battle sequences, some good & bad acting performances, superb direction and a kind of tiresome yet adequate script. Bottom line, 'Kingdom of Heaven' is a guy movie, with enough blood and guts to fill eighty swimming pools.The story is set in 12th century during the bloody Crusades, and follows a once blacksmith turned war hero, Bailan (Orlando Bloom) -- who later becomes Bailan of Ibelin. He is recruited by his father, Gonfrey (Liam Neeson) who he's never met before, to join the Crusaders and be a warrior with him. Bailan goes with his father to Jerusalem, so he can achieve forgiveness for his sins and his wife's sin of committing suicide. Bailan becomes a Crusader who fights for the leader of Jerusalem, King Baldwin (Edward Norton - in an uncredited role), against the Muslim forces. Bailan is mentored by a friends of his father, Tiberias (Jeremy Irons) and Hospitaler (David Thewlis), and has run-ins with a fellow French crusader and cruel soon-to-be new king of Jerusalem, Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas), while he secretly tries to romance Guy's wife and sister to King Baldwin, Sibylla (Eva Green). The movie also stars U.K. actor Brendan Gleeson as Guy de Lusignan's right hand man, Reynald, who is just as evil, ruthless and despicable. 'Kingdom of Heaven' is a success for the most part. The editing is very neat and clean, and the visual effects are spectacular. The cinematography, costumes, makeup and musical score are phenomenal, and Ridley Scott does an excellent job behind the camera of this sprawling war epic. The acting of the film is kind of a mixed bag. The two strongest performances of the film come from Jeremy Irons and Liam Neeson. SPOILER -- Although Liam Neeson is spectacular as Godfrey, he only has about ten minutes screen time. In a way it was up to Irons to steal the show, but he couldn't because of his supporting role. Irons is extraordinary as usual as the brave and prudent guide of Bailan, and he provides perhaps the finest performance of the film. Edward Norton has a bit part as King Baldwin (whose face we never get too see because the King's character has leprosy, and his face is covered by silver masks his entire screen time). French actress Eva Green is very good in her role (following her breakthrough role as the mentally complex sexual deviant teenager in Bernardo Bertolucci's 'The Dreamers'). I predict a strong future ahead of Ms. Green in the film industry as an actress. Brendan Gleeson is perfect for his role as the disgusting and vile war hound Reynald, and Marton Csokas does a great job making you believe he's a nasty, cowardly French prick. The only real disappointment in the cast is it's lead -- Orlando Bloom. It isn't so much Bloom is a bad actor (he's kind of alright), it's just that he's so wimpy and unbelievable as a war hero he kind of ruins some of the film's would-be authenticity. During the movie, while I was watching him act through his scenes, I kept thinking of a handful of different actors that could have fit the part better then him. I think Orlando Bloom was picked because he's a well-known actor now, and with him in the film it would boost ticket sales by attracting younger audiences (especially drooling teenage girls with a crush). In the end, Bloom ends up pulling it off, but not as smoothly as one would or could hope. The screenplay of 'Kingdom of Heaven' is very average for this kind of flick. The plot flows good for the most part, but some scenes of dialogue (especially the ones between Bloom and Green) are so long, drawn-out and pointless it will have you yawning at two o'clock in the afternoon.In conclusion, 'Kingdom of Heaven' is the film for you if you like largely scoped action epics with plenty of blood and violence, but not too much intelligent scenes of dialogue. It's definitely not an Oscar contender, but it is a very good film in that it entertains us and keeps us wanting more. I recommend this movie to anyone looking to have a fun time at the movie theaters and learn a little about war history.

119,bgar-80932,Better than remembered,7,2 October 2019,"I saw this movie when it was in theaters and didn't remember much for it and it left very little impression. I gave the director's cut a shot here because I heard that's what you need to watch to really appreciate it. I do appreciate it more. Some put it on par with Gladiator or Braveheart and I can't make that stretch but it was good. Even in a 3 hour movie I feel like some of the story line is speed along a bit to the detriment of the movie so you can't really tell why certain people feel certain ways. It's a complicated subject matter though so that's kind of to be expected. Braveheart for example is a lot easier. England is bad, the end. This is fighting over Holy Land and none of the parties are on the right side in my opinion. Bloom is in the end because he's done with that life but really it's hard to like anyone in this. There's one Muslim who spared Bloom because he himself was spared by the man and I guess it shows both of them have honor but it's hard for me to care for them. Liam Neeson was the one I cared for the most but he didn't last long. The armies at the end were staggering though and although they didn't show a crazy prolonged battle quite like LOTR or something you still felt the weight of it. I think the director's cut is needed to get a true opinion of this and I think it's good, not quite great.",Kingdom of Heaven
120,judywalker2,This movie suffers from bad storytelling,4,27 November 2005,"I just now saw (DVD) this movie and I knew right away why it didn't do well in the theaters; it suffers from bad storytelling. The subject matter is very interesting, the actors top-notch, the scenery pretty, but the mish mash that the screenwriter and director make of what could have been an enjoyable film got me laughing about twenty minutes into it. I'm not sure if they were trying to make a Gladiator or A Braveheart but they missed on both accounts. And did anyone else hear the '13th Warrior' music or was it just me. Poor Orlando having to suffer through the premiere and subsequent release of this poorly told tale of political intrigue during the crusades, I feel for him and everyone who forked over their hard earned money to see if in the theaters.

It takes a couple of seconds to work out what this awesome sight actually is. Until those tiny suns come catapulting toward you in all their blazing horror. The scene's tyopical of Kingdom, which sneaks up on you - then confounds all expectations; this really isn't Gladiator II - it's a plea for religious and cultural tolerance. Strangely, it didn't exactly clean up first time round. Blacksmith-turned-knight Balion (Bloom) struggles to keep the peace between Jews, Christians and Muslims while, all around, pesky Crusaders are determined to light the tough paper in this intelligent and soulful epic.

122,diane-34,As historically accurate as we can expect.,10,15 May 2005,"I watched this brilliant movie yesterday afternoon and found it to be an incredible experience-an experience not anticipated when viewing big budget movies. I had a little trepidation before I watched Scott's latest film because I was not totally convinced by some of the Hollywood bits added to Gladiator but I need not have worried. I have trawled through the waters of the Crusades from both the western sources as well as the Arab sources and I could find few points in this film to argue about.The dominant character of the film was Salahadin-in my opinion Massaud completely stole every scene he was in. Salahadin was one of the great characters of history. He strode the stage of Crusader times with a dominance unmatched by any of the Europeans who had the misfortune to occupy the same territory at the same time. If Salahadin is one of history's greats, then Reynald of Chatillon would have to be one of its worst and the events of his capture after the decisive battle of the Horns of Hattin were depicted accurately and well.I have always been a movie viewer who is drawn into a film, first of all, by the screen's images and Scott and his cinematographer, Mathieson, painted a movie canvas as beautiful as I could have ever hoped to see. The starkness and beauty of the locations were breathtaking. Scott's shot selections cannot be faulted. The editing of the fast-paced battle scenes left me with a believable sense of medieval warfare without leaving me drowned in blood. The quiet scenes within various palaces were little oasis for the viewer to collect their wits before the next rush of Crusader violence.If you think I loved this movie, you are right.

This is the first time I have seen Orlando Bloom in a picture and after hearing all the fuss about him, I figured I would see if he was worth while as an actor. I was impressed by his acting but I don't see what all the fuss is about this man. He is just an average looking man and not the sex symbol that all the women are swooning over. I would much rather see Liam Neeson with a larger role, but I guess that is not to be. I thought the picture was entertaining and kept my interest, but then I started to fidget in my seat, wondering how long this was going to go on. If you like spectacular movies then go see this one. It is no Ben Hur but it is worth while to go see.",Kingdom of Heaven
124,Flagrant-Baronessa,"""Be without fear in the face of your enemies. Safeguard the helpless, and do no wrong.""",7,3 August 2006,"As long as there are sandals, swords and battlefields, and as long as people want to make movies about these things, Orlando Bloom will probably always do alright for himself financially. In Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven he is a blacksmith turned warrior who sets out to Jerusalem on a crusade to get in touch with god and to be forgiven for his sins. Kingdom of Heaven refers to this holy place and documents Balian's (that's Bloom) life as a soldier--leader--lover and man. It interweaves glorious battles with brooding drama, love with hate and politics with religion. In short, it is big, bigger, epic.No one really knows what happened in the Holy Land during the Dark Ages or why it happened, just that it laid the way for a conflict between Europe and the East that still exists today. There are numerous sides of the story, and this is one of them as told by Ridley Scott. He is possibly my favourite director and there is no one I trust more to craft epic war sagas like this. That is why I was slightly disappointed in the end product. Kingdom of Heaven is a two and a half hour long adventure and yes, it does feel every bit as long. Perhaps that is because it has more depth than Scott's Gladiator, and is much more introspective in both approach and mood. Unfortunately, this also makes it a bit more difficult to get into and the biggest problem is that there is a lack of cinematic harmony in the film - that is, no traceable thread throughout to bring about balance; it's just a series of scenes. The dialogue is so serious that it ends up placeholder and you feel the weight of such heavy conflict in the film at all times and Kingdom of Heaven does not offer relief to this intense mood.I don't know whose genius idea it was to cast Orlando Bloom as the lead but I imagine the person must have gone: ""Alright, we need a young handsome guy who can swing a sword and who's popular with the teenage girls."" Hey, I know: Elf-guy! Bloom is better in this film than in anything else I have seen him in, but he still ends up as merely competent in his performance, lacking the true conviction that should have been with his character... at least toward the end.Onto the good parts. Aside from Bloom, the cast is incredible. Even King Baldwin who is in a mask in the entire film is played by high-profile actor Edward Norton. It seems as though a respected actor has been crammed into every little supporting role, and you hear no complaints from me, because this is excellent. Jeremy Irons is fantastic. The battle-scenes are gloriously epic and The Return of the King-styled, especially when the Muslims try to breach the city of Jerusalem. It nearly becomes a pastiche of Peter Jackson at this point. Ultimately, Kingdom of Heaven is a beautiful film - but too heavy to be blockbuster material, and simply not great enough to truly get into. 7/10",Kingdom of Heaven

I could have duplicated this effort, if I had a hundred years and unlimited funds. No, how anyone could deny this director anything is beyond me.Is it an idealized vision?

That city is of course a tempting subject for makers of adventure movies given that it has been destroyed at least twice, been attacked 52 times, besieged 23 times and changed ownership 44 times.Balian de Ibelin comes to Jerusalem (not really of his own will mind you) during a time when it was in Christian hands only to discover that most of the Christian noblemen are arrogant, warmongering assholes. Not only that but they are stupid beyond belief. The results are disastrous of course. The movie blurb is actually not very accurate. When Balian is at the point were he has to defend the people there is no peace, fragile or otherwise.The movie is quite well done, no question about that. The scenery, the acting, all of it is on the level of a very good movie. It is not really an action movie though. More of a adventure/drama movie. Balian's journey towards the final confrontation is a rather slow process and it is only towards then end, during the siege of Jerusalem, that the movie truly heats up on the action front. The siege of Jerusalem with its siege machines is quite impressive though. Not overdone with ridiculous CGI but well done.It is also a depressing movie. The Christian noblemen, their disastrous behaviors and the equally disastrous end result makes me have a hard time to really like this movie. It is a good movie but I did not enjoy it as much as it deserves.",Kingdom of Heaven
128,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,6,8 May 2005,"With Kingdom of Heaven Ridley Scott has made a sprawling epic with authentic sets and costumes, plenty of massive battles and action sequences, and a cutesy liberal story to suit our tempestuous contemporary times. Like the violence which is all around us today in reality the major fault with Kingdom of Heaven is that we have seen it all before. Over the top battle scenes are all fine and good but that is all there seems to be coming out of Hollywood at the moment. Here we feel little emotional contact with any of the central characters, we are introduced to far too many minor characters, and to top it off the action is not filmed or edited particularly well. To give it credit there are some good performances but no-one stands out, and it at least tries to be historically accurate. The anti-war messages are explosively clear and we get to see what devastation comes from petty religious difference. Scott must be commended on making a film that is not afraid to say it is personal faith that should be important, not the billions of different churches which lie on every street corner, and that to find peace and goodness in yourself should be respected. Then again, it is so typically liberal, yet offers no hope for the future. Nowadays terms of agreement over War are not so easily reached, and our leaders are far from heroic, just, or wise. In the end it all seems shallow and pointless and at times there is a sense of absurdity about it all: A supposedly great warrior and general falls for the simplest of traps by being drawn away from his water supply, Bloom's wife is largely forgotten about, and several fights happen for apparently no reason.Bloom is Balian the blacksmith, a recent widower after his wife killed herself, having lost their child. Out of nowhere comes Sir Godfrey, played by Neeson who claims to be Balian's father and wants him to come along to Jerusalem. He hopes to be forgiven for his past sins. On the Godfrey tells Balian of the prospects of the Holy City, but is wounded and eventually dies. After a ship wreck and encounter with a Muslimwhere Balian proves himself to be honourable, he reaches Jerusalem. There is an uneasy alliance between The Christian King Baldwin (Norton doing a strange Brando impersonation) and the Muslim ruler Saladin (Massoud). Baldwin is a leper and will soon die, leaving his brother-in-law, the sadistic Guy who prays for war without reason. The two rulers have kept peace for a long time, but war seems inevitable. Guy is married to Baldwin's sister Sibylla and will therefor gain power. Baldwin sees the righteousness in Balian and offers him to become King, but Balian refuses knowing he would be the cause of Guy's death, even though they hate each other and Balian has already killed many. The King dies, and war begins. Balian travels to his new stronghold with his knights to prepare for defence, showing he is not a ruler but a normal, working man who seems to have picked up some excellent sword-fighting skills and battle tactics knowledge. He makes all the men of the city knights as this will inspire them to fight with more conviction, and after a series of battles he surrenders Jerusalem to the Muslims. It is not the city that matters, but the people who live in it, and it was neither side who started the age old war. To this day it continues.The film looks beautiful, and Scott knows how to handle an epic. However, there is nothing surprising here and even though I don't feel originality is a necessary part of the criteria of movies, there seems to be little point in watching another city come under siege from another mass of soldiers with another barrage of arrows and flaming balls. We could accept it in LOTR because nothing like it had been seen before, and they were filmed with a much greater degree of intensity, skill, and detail than in this. Definitely worth seeing but it's about time we brought our movies back down to earth for a while, or at least create some characters who can grab our emotions if you're going to have them parading about heroically.6.5 out of 10",Kingdom of Heaven
129,twelve-house-books,Balanced History,8,23 November 2020,"This is a nonpartisan perspective on the Crusades complete with good knights, bad knights, good nights, bad nights, honorable Muslims, dishonorable Muslims, religious Christendom freaks, and true followers of Christ. This may also be Orlando Bloom's finest hour, and it's certainly Liam Neeson's, both box office draws along with a handful of other high-profile actors. For battle scene enthusiasts, this film will not disappoint, but there are too many pep talks and not enough ingenious dialogue based in theological/philosophical axioms, though there are a number peppered throughout.

130,paulcreeden,"Heavenly metaphor, I think.",8,16 December 2005,"I fell victim to corporate media press on this one when it was on the big screen, and I regret it. I now understand why corporate American media walked the party line on this film, and why they trashed it. What if Jerusalem was a metaphor for Iraq, or possibly America itself? I don't pretend to know what was in the minds of Ridley Scott and William Monahan, but it was refreshing to view an historic epic which was based in ethics and contempt for religious fanaticism of all stripes. The epic acting was typically stiff with the exceptions of Liam Neeson, David Thewlis, Ghassan Massoud and Edward Norton (in mask, no less). Orlando Bloom compensated for his rather stilted heroism by being visually stunning in his role. The cinematography was a little dark in the beginning of the film for the small screen. The DVD version has a tremendous history lesson, posted as subscripts to the film as a special feature. As a Medieval buff, I was genuinely impressed.",Kingdom of Heaven
131,rooee,Big Kev auditioned for the wrong part...,6,3 May 2010,"Alas, we can only lament what might have been. Kevin McKidd, who has little more than a cameo in Ridley Scott's borderline bombastic Jerusalem epic, would shape an eminently credible rags-to-hero lead in Bruno Heller's HBO drama Rome the same year. We could have had worse than Orlando Bloom, though – just look at the casting of Alexander the year before.The first third of Kingdom of Heaven is best, when it's exploring the difference between religion and spirituality, courtesy of fine supporting turns from David Thewlis and Edward Norton as Hospitaler and Kind Baldwin respectively. ""The soul belongs to the man,"" Baldwin asserts. William Monaghan's script goes to great lengths to underline the fact that this is a war made by men in the name of God, not the other way around.The second third is where we get the juicy double-crossings and pacts, and where Marton Csokas delightfully hammy Guy de Lusignan has a chance to chew the meticulously crafted scenery. This is also where the relationship between Sibylla (the elegant Eva Green) and her son develops. I'm told the theatrical cut didn't include this subplot, which sounds insane, as it provides a dense emotional hub for the drama, whilst also elevating a central love story above a simple matter of lust.It's really in the third act that the film comes unstuck, descending into a single elongated and slightly boring battle scene, potted with those distracting CGI bird's-eye shots which serve only to pop your bubble of suspended disbelief, as well as two or three long speeches concocted from lines spoken earlier in the movie. And while it's laudable to assert that the seeds of a so-called ""Holy War"" are planted solely by savage, greedy men, in a thunderous film like this, where the bad guys are irretrievable monsters and the good guys are aphorism-firing angels, then three long hours before the dust has finally settled it's frankly a foregone, wishful, and somewhat redundant, conclusion.",Kingdom of Heaven
132,NoArrow,"Exciting, epic and thoughtful",8,7 May 2005,"Ridley Scott's ""Kingdom of Heaven"" will no doubt be compared to ""Troy"", ""Alexander"", ""King Arthur"" and ""Gladiator"", but ""Gladiator"" is the only movie that it is on level with. ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is more concerned with characters and themes than it is with fight scenes (although those are superb) or attractive faces. It is like ""Gladiator"" (also directed by Ridley Scott) in that it is a character study of warriors, examining not only their actions, but what beliefs and idealisms lead to them.The film starts with young Balian (Orlando Bloom), a poor blacksmith in a tiny French hamlet, silently mourning the death of his wife and child. Godfrey (Liam Neeson), a crusading English knight, arrives with his band of soldiers and meets Balian. He claims to be Balian's father, and asks that he come with him.Balian accepts, but only after he vengefully kills a priest and is on the run from Vatican officials. This leads to a fight scene in a snowy forest that is perfectly paced, filmed, and choreographed, stunning us in the audience.Tragedy strikes and eventually Balian travels to Jerusalem, where he meets a slew of new characters, some bad, some conflicted, most good. Among these characters are Tiberius (Jeremy Irons), the gravel-voiced marshal of Jerusalem; Hopsitaler (David Thewlis), Godfrey's friend and wise adviser; Guy de Lusignan (Martin Csokas) and Reynard (Brendan Gleeson), trouble making Templar knights; King Baldwin (Edward Norton), a leper with a weak body but a strong mind and heart; and Sibylla (Eva Green), Baldwin's sister and Guy's wife, a dreamer, a romantic.In Jerusalem there is an uneasy truce between the Muslims and the Christians. Uneasy not because either side hates the other, but because of the small band of Arab-hating Templar Knights and Saladin (Ghassan Massoud), the Muslim Sultan, who has a massive army just waiting to strike if the Muslims of Jerusalem are wronged.Guy and Reynard are the only characters in the movie who want to break this truce. Everyone else  the King, Hospitaler, Tiberius  believe that killing infidels is not the way to heaven. This creates a divide, and with the death of the King impending, anything could happen.I won't spoil what does happen; only that most of the characters are forced to ask themselves some moral and spiritual questions, the outcomes of which will affect Jerusalem (and maybe the world entire) on a grand scale. One of the most important themes raised asks us if a little sin is excusable if it prevents terrible things from happening.The movie doesn't answer all of its questions, but it ends with a massive battle between two armies, neither bad nor good, both reluctant, pulled into the war because the circumstances of the politics, and the brash actions of the extremists around them.The movie is both a technical and artistic achievement. The location sets, cinematography and choreography work together to make the movie visually compelling, so much so that one watched it and disliked the acting and writing, one could still enjoy the movie. But how one can dislike the acting and writing, I don't know. Great performances comes from Bloom, Neeson, Norton (whose face is never seen, and yet he leaves a lasting impression), Irons, Green, Massoud and Thewlis. We get to know each of these characters pretty well as the movie goes along. We see what they believe, what they think is worth fighting and dieing for, and what they think is not, and how they will compromise these idealisms through politics and loyalty.Hospitaler is the most intriguing of these characters. Thewlis steals every scene he's in from Bloom, or Neeson or Irons, and we listen intently as he explains his outlook on religion and the world. It's the best performance in the movie, deserving an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. It teaches and inspires. When Thewlis is marching off to war for a cause the completely opposite from his beliefs and Balian says to him, ""You march to certain death,"" he replies, smiling: ""All death is certain,"" and rides away, waving.The movie should be seen for its questions, answers, and political statements, but also for its romance and sense of adventure, its lusty heroes and thoughtful dialogue. It's an adventure that pleases the eye, the heart, and the mind, which is hard to find these days.8.5/10",Kingdom of Heaven
133,mOVIemAN56,Not quite a masterpiece but still visually stunning and entertaining,7,15 October 2005,"Kingdom of Heaven is film taking place in the age of the Crusades. Balian (Orlando Bloom) is a young blacksmith in England as yet another Crusade is set to begin. Soon a man arrives named Godfrey (Liam Neeson) who offers Balian freedom of his sins if he goes to the Holy Land with him to fight in the crusades. Godfrey is Balian's father and is intent on guiding his son on the right path. After many setbacks and the loss of Godfrey, Balian arrives in Jerusalem. After meeting such people as the faceless King Baldwin (Edward Norton ) and Tiberius (Jeremy Irons), the Marshall of Jerusalem, Balian is instituted as commander of forces in Jerusalem. As war slowly erupts with Muslim forces moving towards the city, Balian must find the strength and courage to save the people of the city and Jerusalem, the Kingdom of Heaven. The film is beautifully filmed from beginning to end. Ridley Scott is a master of visuals. He makes a viewer feel as if they're actually in the battle being fought. The visual shots of the armies and the cities are stunning and believable, unlike the blockbuster catastrophe of Troy. Orlando Bloom has had so many disappointing films since the end of the LOTR trilogy. In Kingdom of Heaven he redeems himself. He is given a smarter character with more depth and personality then previous films. He is a believable army commander and person. His character is able to work out chemistry with other characters of the film. Bloom has done a fantastic job of portraying a desperate man who undergoes a slight transformation form lonely blacksmith to knight. No matter how good of a job Bloom did and the chemistry he had, the work of Eva Green as Sibylla, the sister of King Baldwin and Edward Norton are incredible. The chemistry on screen is something that I've rarely seen before. The love of the two is undaunted even by Baldwin's leprosy. In the king's final scene and unmasking your eyes will swell with tears at how much he actually suffered. The film is more of a drama then a full-fledged war film. Don't get me wrong, the half hour siege of Jerusalem is brilliant and well placed. The film aims more to give reason for the attacks on Jerusalem rather then just show pointless warfare. The film does justice to both religions represented in the film, Islam and Christianity. The films gives reason why the Islams wished to attack the city and why the Christians sought to defend it. No discrimination to either religion is present.Kingdom of Heaven is no masterpiece but it certainly is a wonderful and entertaining film. Its battle scenes are second to none, its drama is powerful, and above all else the characters are believable.Kingdom of Heaven. Starring: Orlando Bloom, Eva Green, Edward Norton, Liam Neeson, Ghassan Massoud, and Jeremy Irons.3 1/2 out of 5 Stars.",Kingdom of Heaven
134,OttoVonB,That's more like it! (review of the Director's Cut),9,9 May 2005,"Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven really is a retrospective of his entire career. It has the attention to detail of 1492 and Blade Runner, the character work and cast that surpasses any he has ever assembled and his typically beautiful visual signature.The film uses Orlando Blom's character as a vessel to explore the dream and politics behind the war for Jerusalem, and how the dream of peace of two men (King Baldwin and Salhaddin) erodes into a bloody war unleashed by a religious fever they can not contain. This allows for calm and intimate moments as well as dazzling scenes of war (and quite innovative use of period weaponry). It also has more unique and delicate touches: the dreamy monster with the delicate heart (Baldwin, magnificently played by Edward Norton), an ""antagonist"" who threatens to steal the entire show with an unearthly charisma (Salhaddin), certain moments of folly (thumbs up to a demented Brendan Gleeson).This has all the makings of a classic, just like Gladiator rejuvenated the swords and sandals epic. It is highly unfortunate that its popularity will forever bear the scar of a woefully misguided theatrical cut, amputated of 45 priceless minutes of screenplay and essential character development. But thankfully, in the 21st century, DVD sets a film's legacy, with the cinema experience nothing but an hors-d'oeuvre (a rule set in stone by the Lord of the Rings trilogy). One of the few technical bum notes is a muddled music score, more low-key than in most Ridley Scott films, that even borrows cues from Hannibal and The 13th Warrior.A film that, despite history writing action scenes (Bloom + a Templar Night + a pretty mean rock = a delightful piece of cinematic nastiness), you remember for quieter character moments has classic written all over it. The religious aspect might seem contrived to some who would wish to see less political correctness, but they ignore the incredible timeliness of Ridley Scott's message. In a time where the global tension between Muslims and Christians/Jews moves ever closer to the breaking point, Kingdom of Heaven is an intelligent and moving slap in the face of human stupidity.History will redeem it, but to anyone who's had the pleasure of admiring the newly released director's cut (a must-have DVD), it is obvious that Kingdom of Heaven might yet prove to be Ridley Scott's finest film.",Kingdom of Heaven
135,Med-Jasta,A masterpiece...,10,3 August 2020,"That word gets used a lot but there's no other way to describe this. Of course I'm talking about the directors cut. The theatrical cut was ok. Started off great and then fell about half way through because they took out the middle of the movie! Over the years this movie has gained some of the recognition it deserves but if the intended version came out first the movie would have been an instant classic. If there was ever a movie that deserved more credit this is it.I saw it in the theaters and was disappointed. Then when I heard there was a directors cut I got it no questions asked. I didn't look up reviews or see how different it was. Because it was clear that there was a good movie there they just didn't include it. I wasn't disappointed and it became one of my favorites.This movie tackles a very sensitive subject with grace and wisdom. Religion isn't the bad guy, extremist are. Religions are well intentioned. Everything good, bad and ugly that happens with each religion in the movie occurs on both sides. And the message: it doesn't matter what God you believe in as long as you are a good person and help those in need. I don't believe in God. I wish there was one, that would be great.As Ridley is able to do he takes important themes with a message and puts them into a kick ass movie. You can walk away from this satisfied from a good movie or questioning religion like I did.Of course the action scenes are great. The first one with Liam Nesson's group is the best. There's so many fights that they don't even show all of them, you just see the aftermath. This movie pulls off the impossible where you're happy that they lose in the end because that's really winning.Great cast of course. Orlando Bloom gives a great subtle performance. Liam Nesson has only a few minutes but you never forget him. Edward Norton is fantastic. And the stand out star: Ghassan Massoud. He was so good. I hope to see him in more things. He had a great presence. And a awesome voice.I think really the point of this movie is to remind people that this religious fight is still going on and it's ridiculous.Ridley puts all his talents to good use and gives us a great movie to watch and think about. This may have been the last truly epic 3 hour movie to come out. Not just epic but the kinda movie where the director was about to make a huge intellectual movie. This movie satisfied me cinematically and intellectually. I hope they make more.",Kingdom of Heaven
136,freakfire-1,Bloom rides the magic Madame Butterfly.,8,1 April 2008,"Don't let the inclusion of Orlando Bloom fool you: he doesn't have a bow and arrow in this film. Instead, he brandishes a sword. But he is still able to fight. In fact he ends up in command, which is slightly different than other films he has been in.The story, while good, was different in a lot of areas on the historical Balian. He did, in fact have a wife before his defense at Jerusalem. And in real life, he fled to Tyre. Instead, Bloom's character went back to France with the ex-Queen of Jerusalem.Despite that historical flaw, it did capture a lot of what went on. It was fairly accurate with Saladin and some of the problems he had on his side. The Knights Templar were seen as the pure aggressors. That, however, is not how history sees it.However, this was for theatrical reasons and the producers of the film know this. So, in extra DVD, there is a ""Hollywood Vs. History"" that explains the differences.As far as the movie action, drama, visuals go; those were pure excellent. It was very enjoyable to watch the film in that way. So, I liked it.Overall, its not better than Gladiator, but it does come close. Enjoy is for yourself. ""A-""",Kingdom of Heaven
137,brenttraft,Beautiful but Shallow,4,8 May 2005,"Kingdom of Heaven has the best production quality of any film this year. The photography, cinematography, and music are gorgeous. This is a big screen spectacular.Unfortuanately, the story is pretty boring and the ""good guy"" have so little personality, it is not a very involving experience. The character with the most charisma is played by Liam Neesom and he does not have that much screen time.If you think you want to see this film, be sure to see it in the theater. This is a film that will lose most of it's attributes if you watch it on video.If you are like me and can appreciate good production quality, it will be worthwhile. If you are like most people and are more interested in a story and it's characters, you will likely be disappointed.",Kingdom of Heaven
138,ExpendableMan,Kingdom of Heaven: The Definitive Edition,9,29 June 2007,"Historical epics are great aren't they? They're the sort of films Hollywood was built to provide us with; big and expensive with casts of thousands and earth trembling battles where all is drowned out by the clash of swords and the screams of the dying. From the scope and scale of Lawrence of Arabia to the power-metal-album-as-a-movie blood and thunder of 300, historical epics are surely what was bubbling away in the brains of the first people to ever pick up cameras and realise they could make the pictures move. Back in 2005 however they've had a bit of a rough ride, what with misfires like Troy and Alexander so it falls to Ridley Scott, director of the classic Gladiator to return the genre to its former glory with Kingdom of Heaven: the story of a blacksmith being made into a knight and going to Jerusalem during the crusades in order to find redemption for his troubled soul. Somewhere along the production line though, studio executives realise that Scott isn't redoing the blood thirsty revenge opera that made Gladiator such a triumph and has actually made a film about religious tolerance that goes on for over three hours and is largely comprised of talking. So, in come the scissors and out go large chunks of footage in the editing process, taking entire sub plots along with it and blurring lots of the character motivation leaving us with a two hour long movie with a difficult to follow plot and a big fight at the end. The critics bring out the knives and audiences stay away. Kingdom of Heaven does not go down well.But then there is a light at the end of the tunnel when the DVD release comes about and takes practically everyone involved by surprise by selling eight hundred billion copies in around two minutes. Fast forward a couple of years and presto! We have a director's cut and a definitive edition, presented in a shiny tin box and more extras than Saving Private Ryan. And after showing us how incredibly seriously we're meant to be taking this movie by playing the soundtrack overture at the beginning before the credits even roll(!), Scott kickstarts the movie proper...And here's where things start getting ridiculously good. Orlando Bloom's Balian for instance is suddenly fleshed out into a fully realised character, rather than a perpetually frowning blacksmith with a talent for learning sword play, engineering skills and leadership qualities very, very quickly. His back-story makes a lot more sense and Bloom finally comes into his own as a leading man; acting like a professional instead of a recently-graduated drama school student. The fact that he's bulked up into a swashbuckling action hero doesn't do any harm either. Alongside him comes Ed Norton as the masked leper king of Jerusalem, turning what was originally a cameo character into a pivotal role on who the entire third act relies. In terms of acting meanwhile, perhaps the best thing to come out of this extended version is the fact that Eva Green's Sibylla's behaviour makes sense now. Whereas before she basically shagged Balian then went crazier than Britney Spears after an especially traumatic pregnancy, the revelation that she has a son and the subsequent events that surround him go some way towards justifying her actions.For those of you looking for an increase in the spectacle of the action scenes however, you're going to be disappointed. The climactic siege of Jerusalem appears unchanged from the theatrical version but given how breathtaking in scope it was first time around this seems like a shallow complaint. On the social side of things however, the tensions between the Knights of Jerusalem, the army of the Saracens and the fanatical Christian Templars are given far more screen time. And whereas before they wound up slicing each other to pieces because the Holy Land seemed like a good place to have a fight, the definitive edition paints a full picture of the differences in ideology and uneasy treaties.As a result, viewed in its full glory, Kingdom of Heaven is a masterpiece. More epic than Gladiator, more violent than Troy and more serious than Alexander. Not quite as much fun as 300 of course but then that is a completely different ball game altogether. The script is well written, the scope vast and every actor involved puts in the performance of their life. Given the somewhat hazardous task of navigating religious hostilities, it also does a noble job; there are evil men and decent men on both sides. No particular ideology is flawless and when the siege comes around, we have a clear picture of each army's point of view and just how many movies nowadays take the time necessary to do that? Excellent film, highly recommended.",Kingdom of Heaven
139,shanfloyd,A masterpiece by Scott.,10,6 May 2005,"It should be said first that viewers of all religious background will get the same pleasure from this latest film by Ridley Scott. Though the film is based on the early crusade between the Muslims and Christians, none of the two religions are offered any kind of disrespect. The story centers around the Christian side of the battle, what both the protagonist and the actual villain are from. Muslims are shown as just the other party at the war, and the film contains two strong and important Muslim characters. From such politically safe point, the movie still raises some thought-provoking issues. But before that, it also must be said that ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is going to be one of the best epic war movies ever made. Its script, visual effects, acting and of course the direction are awe-inspiring. A total feast for the eyes, ears and mind, in all.The story starts with Balian, a poor blacksmith who suddenly meets his father he never knew of before - Godfrey of Ibelin who led the Christian army of Jerusalem before. Godfrey pursues him to go to Jerusalem and aid the King there as a knight. There he gets into a complex relationship with Sybilla, the sister of the King and wife of Guy de Lusignan, who got crowned after the King's death. After Guy broke the truce previously signed, the Muslim Sultan Salah-e-din or Saladin attacked Jerusalem, defeated Guy and now it's time for Balian to protect the city. This much can be said about the story without giving any spoiler. However, it is highly interesting to find a character like Balian. After his wife and child died, he does not believe in God or religion. He always suffered from a lack of strong motive when he came to Jerusalem to join the army. In his mind there were always dilemma about religion and about this war. He addresses his men not from a Christian point of view, but from the fact that they are human beings who have right to defend. Now, the film has an impressively high historical accuracy, speaking from my limited knowledge of history. I know of Guy de Lusignan, King Baldwin IV, Saladin or Godfrey but I have never read about Balian. Is it a fictitious character? If yes, then I think it is a wonderful move to deliver the basic message of the film.Orlando Bloom may seem a poor choice for Balian, but here he tries his best. Though it is not the best of performances, still he never appeared bad. With long hair and beards he looks good. Same can be said about the ravishingly beautiful Eva Green in her second major film role. Her looks, body language and accent are flawless. I can't comment too much about her acting but I certainly long to see more of her in coming years. Now real acting credits should go to firstly Jeremy Irons who's just awesome as Tiberius and secondly to Ghassan Massoud as Saladin. Liam Neeson also puts a short yet memorable performance as Godfrey and you may not 'see' Edward Norton anywhere in the film but he is quite an interesting choice for the King, listen for yourself. Speaking of the director, I'm sure Mr. Scott bags another Academy nomination next year. His trained eye for the violent battle scenes comes out as one of the biggest assets for the film. He set up really impressive sets and locales and his share to the subplots of the movie besides war are just appropriate.Now what questions does the film arouse? In one place, Tiberius says, ""When we fight for God, I realize now that we fight for land and wealth."" Exactly when we remain truly religious or become fanatics craving for power and wealth in the name of God? Does following one religion mean disrespecting the other? The film leaves an open link to the present Palestine/Israel conflict. The vision of the film throws criticism not to any religion, but the concept of all religions. That is perhaps the biggest issue it made.",Kingdom of Heaven
140,MovieCriticMarvelfan,A great film by Ridley Scott!!!,10,9 April 2005,"KOH is not Gladiator 2, first of all the movie is not about a slave dealing with Romans, at the heart of the movie is the battle for Jerusalem and two sides the Christians and the Muslims. KOH in my opinion raises up more issues than what Gladiator did and then some.The acting was great, Neeson as Godfrey of Ibelin , though he has a small role , leaves quite an impact. Bloom is wonderful, Eva Green is hot, Jeremy Irons is at his usual best , David Thewlis also puts up a great performance as Hospitaller, and Edward Norton turns in a memorable performance.The story is that in 1184 during the time of the Crusades , Balian a blacksmith becomes a knight to defend Jerusalem from Muslim invaders.Bloom as the protagonist who doesn't believe in God or religion, ""I am just a blacksmith"", undergoes a spiritual journey that tests both his values as a man (do I stay here and fight for people of Jerusalem) and his ideals about religion. He also has his morality come into question through almost the entire movie, does his give into temptation and join the dissenters of the church (Guy De Lusignan) or does he kill and lie to get what is offered a seat of the throne.The directing is brilliant, I believe this is shot on location if not, the sets, the special effects and budget really show. Ridley Scott as the veteran has a great eye for setting up locales, key battle scenes and incredible emotional characters.Balian's character is also 100% vulnerable he takes his series of hard shots and hangs on to claim victory just when you think the numbers are against the guy he finds a way to outsmart his opponents.Back to story. Balian kills a priest who mocks his late wife who committed suicide. ""she is in hell because she committed suicide"" and so Balian out of rage and the contempt this guy has for him kills him. He is now a fugitive. When he learns Godfrey of Ibelin is his father, , Godfrey wants him to fight in the crusades and go to Jerusalem.Balian still in shock doesn't want to go with his dad. When the authorities come to claim Balian and execute him, there is a big battle which results in some of Godfrey's nights being killed. Balian seeing the sacrifice the knights have done for him, finally does go with his father.Balian gets christened as a knight, but doesn't believe in God, is not an atheist per say, he believes in death but he doesn't believe in the greater good.This is a key issue being brought up throughout the movie, what is religion? Is it just words or actions that we live by. Does God really offer us hope and salvation, and the answer is yes.When his dad dies and through the speeches with Hospitaller (David Thewlis) who talks about him about religion that Balian he starts to have a spiritual awakening of sorts. Exposed to the poor people of Jerusalem , Balian uses his new power as a lord and a knight to build up shelters and provide water for the people as he says which I am paraphrasing he is trying to be a good man and trying to aid the helpless.Hospitaller: ""Religion is not made up by fanatics.. it's about your rite of actions"" He makes the analogy that religion really is about who you are as a person and by what you do , not by what you preach as a so called Christian.Eva Green is Sybilla the future queen of Jerusalem whose brother King Baldiwn (Norton) is sick and near death. Sybilla likes Balian of Ibelin (Bloom) because she feels he is brave and good. She hates her husband Guy who is one of the knights for King of Jerusalem. She mentions she was forced to marry him in a prearranged deal so there's an internal conflict with Guy and Balian. Guy and Balian previously meet early on when Godfrey introduces him to Lord Tiberius (Jeremy Irons) and Hospitaller. Sybilla also undergoes a transformation in the film as well, when the King dies, she sees in Balian leadership that is absent in her husband.Balian visits places in Jerusalem like the place of Christ's crucifixion and gathers within himself spiritual strength and a sense of direction to the turbulence around him.The Muslim characters in the movie consists of Saladin (Ghassan Massoud)and , Muslim Grandee (Nasser Memazia who want Jerusalem for other uses such as for the nation of Islam. I should say the Muslim characters in this film get a large bulk of screen time. Furthermore, their characters are treated with respect and almost admiration. In fact Scott tells us their back story as well and we see display of Muslim religion in the movie such as Muslim praying in mosques and in the city of Jerusalem.This reminds me of the Palestian/Israeli conflict of sorts where you have both sides that believe in God but are battling for the control of one city, despite the fact that they both profess to believing in God. Some questions to ponder are these other people with religious ideals worse than we say they are, or are they merely some religious fanatics misusing the name of God for power? Couple that the moral questions that almost every character goes through and the questioning and denouncement and spiritual awakening of God and my you got yourself a thought provoking film.KOH is a great film. Not only is it full of action and great characters and wonderful acting but it also has a good story and challenges you as an audience to think about the messages in the movie long after you've left the theater!!!",Kingdom of Heaven
141,jpintar,A great movie,10,6 May 2005,"Kingdom of Heaven is one of the best movies I have seen this year. In other movies I have seen this year, my attention span went in and out as the movie went on. In Kingdom of Heaven, I was thinking about the movie even when I had to go to use the restroom during it. The movie takes place while the Christians still had control of Jerusalem during the Crusades. Orlando Bloom is recruited by a man who he has recently learned is his father, played by the always watchable Liam Neeson, to go to Jersualem to fight in the Crusades. Since Bloom's wife and child are dead, he has no more ties to his home, so he agrees. In Jeruasalem, he finds an uneasy peace going on between Christians and Muslims. I don't think I am giving anything away to say this peace is broken, because there wouldn't be much of a movie because of it. What fascinated me the most was that the kings of both sides would prefer to live in peace rather than make war that would result in thousands getting killed. Unfortunately, there are radicals on both sides who believe they must kill the infidels on the other side and on their own side, especially Christians. Although the film takes place in 1184, the film is still timely in the Middle East today. While getting in line for Star Wars, see this movie too. 10/10",Kingdom of Heaven
142,arieliondotcom,Possible Spoilers: KINGDOM OF COMPROMISE,6,9 April 2006,"After all the hype about it when it first came out, I was disappointed when viewing the film on cable to find that it is nothing more than a tract on compromise. All was well when Christians and Moslems lived together in Jerusalem until those naughty conservative Christians (Templars here) got uppity, and then everything went to hell, literally. Blasphemy against God is strewn throughout the film in terms summed up by the quote ""If this is the Kingdom of Heaven, let God do what he wants with it."" Better to burn all of the sacred sites, since any real conviction is seen as anti-humanist. And the real triumph of the film is Humanism. Any faith in GOD (Hebrew, Christian, or Islamic) is seen as antithetical to peace and good order but Humanism is the True Faith and saves the day by being all things to all people and nothing to anyone at all, allowing one to sniff the pussywillows and ride off into the sunset with one's lady love without being bothered by all those bloodied bullies of the (dare we say it?) Christian and Islamic ilk, more fools they.It is a well crafted film, in terms of appearance and acting. But how sad that the writers knew so little of their subject, the faith groups they grope about with for over two hours. They pile all religions in one heap without regard to the vast difference in the tenets of each, and the background of each.Instead we are left with a thinly veiled tract of ""Give peace a chance"" with no regard to the realities of the Age or the convictions of the very One they deny can help and refuse to turn to in their humanistic smugness, the Prince of Peace.",Kingdom of Heaven
143,anhedonia,Orlando never blooms,5,21 May 2005,"""Kingdom of Heaven"" is a better historical epic than last year's ""Troy"" or ""Alexander."" But that's really not saying much, is it?I've liked Ridley Scott's films, from the marvelously shot ""The Duellists"" (1977) and claustrophobic sci-fi horror, ""Alien"" (1979), to ""Thelma and Louise"" (1991) and the visceral ""Black Hawk Down"" (2001). However, I'm less keen about his historical epics. ""Gladiator"" (2000) bored me. I never understood all the praise bestowed on that mediocre, if well made, film. In my opinion, it was tremendously over-rated and joins ""Braveheart"" (1995) and ""A Beautiful Mind"" (2001) as the most undeserving recent Best Picture Oscar-winners.Now comes another historical epic. This might not be the most opportune time to make an epic about the Crusades. After all, the illustrious President George W. Bush saw fit to call the war on terror a crusade, before realizing he'd made a huge blunder.Scott and writer William Monahan are keenly aware of the time in which their film is being made. So they've made an inoffensive, bland, dull film that's full of bluster that amounts to little and says even less.One of the film's big problems is the casting of Englishman Orlando Bloom in the lead role. A film of this epic nature requires an actor with enough gravitas to hold our attention for 2 1/2 hours. Unfortunately, Bloom, handsome as he is, is not that person.Classically trained he may be, but Bloom's been awfully lucky to be cast alongside other terrific actors in his films. And he's never been asked to carry a whole film. The spectacle of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy allowed Bloom to be lost among the cast and Johnny Depp's the reason ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" (2003) worked so well. In a bad film, such as ""Troy,"" Bloom was miserable as Paris.But this time, Bloom's in charge. He's forced to move the film along, to keep our interest. True, he has a talented supporting cast. But Liam Neeson, Jeremy Irons, Brendan Gleeson, David Thewlis and Ghassan Massoud aren't on the screen long enough to let us forget or ignore Bloom's deficiencies as an actor. Bloom can't play tough. The fate of the film depends on him, but he's a terribly one-note actor without much range. Here, he's positively milquetoast. When you consider his performances in all his movies, you'll realize that Bloom rarely, if ever, varies his tone, mannerisms or performances.Some of this isn't his fault. The film could have lost about 25 minutes or so without too much trouble. The film suffers from slow pacing and Scott should have kept things much tighter.Scott and Monahan allow too many people to give speeches and take such pains to be polite, than the entire film falls flat. It's a valiant attempt and a noble one, too. After all, most of the world's problems today hark back to these days when Christian fought Muslim over a piece of land. And even though the current U.S. administration is too dense to realize it, the problems we face today in Iraq are because of the Palestinian issue. But this is about the Crusades, when one religion determined it was better than any other and went about in brutal fashion to prove its point.Scott's film looks good. The battle scenes, although confusing at times (the director cuts back to some regular actors to make sure we know what's happening), are well done. There are some exciting sequences, including the thrilling climactic battle, with fireballs pummeling the fortress. But even an epic film requires a good, strong leading man. Bloom is neither.",Kingdom of Heaven
144,basrutten,A missed opportunity of epic proportions,8,7 May 2005,"A movie about the crusades is something I've been looking forward to for a long time, and given the fact that I enjoyed Gladiator and many other recent epic movies (Troy, LOTR), this movie should be great, right? Well, not really. While its unquestionably a well-made movie with its heart in the right place, it leaves a lot to be desired.On the surface, everything is OK, though. ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is undeniably beautifully shot, its looks very authentic and its all-star cast generally does an good job. I can even live with Orlando Bloom as the main star. Also, the action sequences, although they are not as plentiful and long as one might except, are generally very well done, even if there is a slight sense of deja-vu with the siege of Jerusalem that looks a lot like the battle for Helm's Deep.It's somewhat of a shame, though, that ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is so politically correct. While I can respect the message of religious tolerance the movie preaches and while it's nice that for once the Muslims aren't the stereotypical bad guys, in general everything seemed far too civilized and reasonable for the Dark Ages. I think other movies like ""Flesh and Blood"" and even ""Braveheart"" came a lot closer to what the middle ages were like than this movie. Let's just hope that Paul Verhoeven ever gets around to doing HIS version of the crusades.The main problems that plague ""Kingdom of Heaven"", though, are a very weak plot and very weak characters. Granted, this kind of movie doesn't need a brilliant plot (the plots of ""Gladiator"" and ""Troy"" aren't that brilliant either) but in KoH everything has been simplified a bit too much. The plot is not more than a sequence of unlikely and/or unnecessary events, delivered at a pace that is far too high. Characters come and go, lack any kind depth or development, and usually fail to say anything useful about all the shocking events that constantly occur around them. And to top it all off, there's a very shallow and pointless romance.""Kingdom of Heaven"" delivers in the action sequences and production values, but without even a reasonable plot or characters to back up the action, everything falls flat and ends up feeling hollow and unsatisfying. It's by no means an utter disaster like ""Alexander"", but it falls far short of most other contemporary epic movies.**1/2 out of *****",Kingdom of Heaven
145,dcldan,failed attempt,6,30 January 2006,"Balian is a blacksmith who does not find the sense of life. When he discovers that he is the son of a knight, he decides to go to Jerusalem to fight in the crusade, defending Christ and God. When he arrives there, he discovers that people doesn't fight for religion, fight for money and hate, which will make him to change his attitude in life. Impressive scenarios and clothes, perfect and convincing, unfortunately, this attempt to repeat Gladiator is not so well done indeed. Film results too much slow and bores sometimes. In the same way, I think that Orlando Bloom is not he best actor to represent a brave knight, he seems horrified during all the movie, when he should to be more confident (at least when he is not fighting, he should keep calm). The secondary actors (Irons and Nesson) are better, but their characters are not deep enough to show what these actors are able to do. It's entertaining but nothing more than that. A good idea with good scenarios, but the attempt to make an epic film is not achieved.",Kingdom of Heaven
146,JoshtheGiant,Better Than Gladiator,9,23 October 2005,"Kingdom of Heaven is a very powerful, and thought provoking. Some of the ideas can after you think about them be very disturbing. This is one of the first films about the crusades, they should make many more it was a very interesting time. The story is very good, every bit makes perfect sense, and it is very powerful. The screenplay is great, the dialogue, the characters, the way it's all put together, almost seamless. The acting is amazing, Edward Norton is the best, he is fantastic, one of the great supporting performances, Jeremy Irons, Eva Green, and surprisingly Orlando Bloom are also standouts. Brendan Gleesons performance was the one thing I didn't like about this film, it was weird and generally stupid. The direction is also great, Ridley Scott is one of the greatest directors, I can't believe he has failed to win an Oscar for directing as of yet. The visual effects are amazing, everything looks real and amazing. Even better than Gladiator.",Kingdom of Heaven

I'm writing this because a friend asked me to review it here to see if she wants to see it, but to be honest, I don't remember the plot that well.That's not to say it was a bad movie, the acting is solid and the fight scenes are epic. The lush scenery was a feast for the eyes and the costumes were breathtaking.I do remember it being poignant, sad, glorious and wonderful.

148,general-melchett,"Not Ridley Scott's best success, but boy, I like it!",9,17 October 2006,"Kingdom of Heaven was not Ridley Scott's greatest success. It didn't recapture the heights of Gladiator, and it wasn't a great hit at the box office. However, it was the first historical epic film I saw, and I'm glad it was too. The plot wasn't particularly complex (though there were some things that were hard to swallow in the film), the action sequences were quite common and well-directed, and unlike BBC's new Robin Hood, it recaptures the Medieval era (no leather jackets or sunglasses - just good old armour and rags) well. Though the score is mostly full-on Hollywood ham, and none of the film's aspects are of Oscar calibre (save the settings), this is a film that shows that Ridley Scott is not losing his touch, and is in fact getting better. Orlando Bloom's performance is not great, but his fighting in the action scenes is tip-top-notch. The ending battle sequences were some of the best I have ever seen, and probably will see, and were far more epic and stunning than Gladiator's. On the whole - I shall say this - Kingdom of Heaven is a job worthy of Ridley Scott's name.Though it's not the new Lord of the Rings or Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven is a film that tells you this - the sword and sandal epic is still in fashion. Fantastic epic entertainment! 9/10 P.S. I hear that there is a director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven out now - with four discs and nearly an hour extra length to the film, and 18 hours of bonus features. I wish I had bought it instead of the one-disc edition - if you are a fan of the film, go buy it now!",Kingdom of Heaven

150,TheMovieMark,"Well, at least Bloom *tried* to look manlier.",6,6 May 2005,"After this movie started to drag longer than Joan Rivers' latest botched face lift, I was ready to start up a BOOOOOOOORING chant in the theater. In fact, I was pretty excited after the movie ended because I couldn't wait for us to start making our little jokes. I was ready to say, ""Kingdom of Heaven, huh? More like Kingdom of BOREDOM!"" I'd poke Stephanie with my elbow, and we'd all laugh hysterically. Then I'd take it one step too far and say, ""Hey, nice beard, Orlando Bloom, it's almost as thick as Mr. Shade's mother's!"" Then everybody would get real quiet and the uncomfortable silence would lead us back to our cars. But it wasn't meant to be.Imagine my absolute shock when Stephanie and the Shades showered the movie with praise afterwards. Mrs. Shade ""loved it,"" Mr. Shade said everything was really good ""but not great,"" and Stephanie painfully admitted that she thought Orlando Bloom was really good (she usually despises him and his girly ways). I was baffled. Had we all just seen the same movie? It's not a bad movie, but I did not feel any emotional attachment to the story or its characters. I was expecting a story ABOUT the Crusades, but this kind of takes place in between. You'll most likely walk out not knowing much more than you already did. OK, so it wasn't what I was expecting. But still, I wouldn't have minded if the movie told a story that I actually cared about. Orlando Bloom decides to protect his home against invaders. Whoopee. That's it? It's like watching a History Channel reenactment. A slice of history is presented to you, but you're not given much reason to root for or root against either side. It's the whole ""let's offend as few people as possible"" approach to film-making.As for Bloom? Well, he isn't bad, but he just didn't do much for me. I didn't buy him as a fearless leader and warrior. Stephanie, on the other hand, thought he was really good. Go figure. Yes, the beard made him look manlier than he was in Troy, but he still looks like a boy trying to wear men's clothing.I think one of the main problems is my ideal epics are Braveheart, The Patriot, and Gladiator. And my ideal epic heroes are Mel Gibson and Russell Crowe. So Kingdom of Heaven and Bloom immediately had the bar set pretty high, and they just didn't deliver strongly enough. This isn't even nearly as good as Troy. It's probably most similar to, and maybe a slight step behind, King Arthur. In fact, after rereading my review of King Arthur (which you're welcome to do as well), the similarities in my opinions of the two movies are quite amazing.So perhaps it has a lot to do with your expectations. Stephanie wasn't expecting to like it at all, so it greatly exceeded her expectations. Mr. Shade expected to like it and he did. I was on the fence and remained that way after the movie failed to overwhelm me. Oh well.The 145-minute runtime should be taken into consideration as well. I like a long movie if I'm really interested in the story and the characters, but this just wasn't keeping my interest. It'd grab it briefly, but then the moonlight would bask on Bloom just a little too long and my thoughts would stray. Don't get me wrong, the cinematography is beautiful, but it can only carry the movie so far. So if you're not in the mood for a really long movie, then this really isn't one that's gonna break you out of that funk.And what was up with the historical inaccuracy? I can understand taking some liberties, but there's such a thing as taking it too far. There's one scene where Princess Sibylla goes to fornicate with Bloom, and she starts philosophizing in regard to why she's come to betray her marital vows. I'm with her up to the point where she says, ""I'm not here because I'm bored or wicked..."" but then she completely loses me when she adds, ""...I'm here because I THINK I LOVE YOU, SO WHAT AM I SO AFRAID OF..."" and a bunch of Crusaders break into song and dance in the background. Come on, what is this, A Knight's Tale? And then when Constantine from American Idol showed up and kicked at the camera I was totally ready to walk out of the theater. Granted, that may only be on the special screening I attended and might hit the cutting room floor before you see it.Anyway, in determining what rating to give this movie I took everybody else's opinion into consideration. Stephanie said she'd probably go with a 3.75, while Mr. Shade said a 3.5. So do I go with an even 3? Nope, I'm gonna go with a 2.75 - rental territory. Some of you may enjoy it more on the big screen, but this is one of those movies that is better watched on DVD while you can multitask - read the paper, cut your nails, wash the dishes, fold the laundry, have a tickle fight with your significant other, read the Movie Mark, things of that nature. You can stop what you're doing every now and then to watch the battle scenes, but it's really not going to hurt you to miss out on a few lines of dialogue.Near the end of the movie Orlando Bloom makes a comment about how if this is the Kingdom of Heaven, then He (referring to God, obviously) can keep it. Well, if this is the best Ridley Scott can do as a follow-up to Gladiator then he can keep it. Now if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go pat myself on the back for that little zinger.Rating: 2.75 (out of 5)",Kingdom of Heaven

Ridly Scott, who is currently making American Gangster, which is released later this year, has done people proud, who were not fully interested because of the first attempt, but should now go and buy it.As for the first version, it should simply be forgotten, and let the Definitive Edition take it's place.",Kingdom of Heaven
152,Atavisten,Finally a fair treatment of the history from Hollywood,8,30 May 2005,"'The Killing of an infidel is not murder. Its the path to heaven!' Crusaders conquered Jerusalem 100 years ago, but have troubles keeping the peace with the Muslim because of many troublemakers amongst them kill and pillage caravans and settlements. The Muslim people also want their city back under the leadership of Saladin.Technically this has some flaws, in the editing for instance they should have spent more time getting it right. Scriptwise it is not wholly finished either and it has some minor inaccuracies to make it fit Hollywood's idea of a blockbuster like a small love story.Still its a very good film taking up an important subject in these post 9/11 times. Its not about the action, Scott did that better in 'Gladiator' or even 'The Duellists', and its not so much about the drama, but for the fair treatment of history. That is much more important than 'LOTR' will ever be.Orlando Bloom is not a good actor, but he still managed to keep his head above water. The other cast like Edward Norton as the king, Jeremy Irons as Tiberias and Ghassan Massoud as Saladin were all exceptional. Eva Green was the only pronouncing french like the French do, apart from that she got too much screen time.A bold move by Ridley Scott that with lesser compromises could be a true epic and milestone, but I guess thats impossible when we're talking this big a budget. He certainly lost some fans here; may he gain tenfold more!",Kingdom of Heaven
153,David_Frames,Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now,5,9 May 2005,"A technically accomplished, complete Hollywood Epic from Ridley Scott that by its very ontology manages to be bland and timid when it could be bold and daring. In respect of its Hollywood credentials I use the term 'complete' pejoratively because although this is a European Co-Production with a British director its nevertheless almost totally generic from the recreative style used to establish period right through to the Teutonic climax with a script riddled with the usual 'no nots' and 'my lords' that passes for antiquated dialogue. You've heard it all before too due to the use of Dante's La Vita Nuova, also used in Hannibal and the choristers employed on the soundtrack to up the classical ambiance, a treatment deployed in just about every Hollywood Epic in the last 10 years. Apparently the Crusades set story strives to provide balance in the question of the West and Christanity against Islam and the Muslim world at large, a question which has contemporary relevance for very obvious reasons. So despite being set in 1184 this is actually a film about 2005 and consequently is blighted by the sensitivities of modern times. Never at any stage does Kingdom of Heaven try to take on the reality of the period. Islamic Warriors are a reasonable, noble bunch provoked by the arrogant, perfidious representatives of Christanity. If by balance Scott meant shying away from the barbarity and violence of Islamic extremism then Kingdom is one of the most balanced films yet produced. Heaven is a beautifully photographed picture with its vistas and CGI seamlessly integrated. Pleasant on the eye then but its a pretty hollow box of tricks when so many characters feel undernourished and Orlando Bloom's lead is so lacking in dynamism that he'd have a job convincing you to follow him anywhere, let alone into battle. He's a problem here because a film of this scale and length needs a strong centre and Bloom, virtually devoid of any screen presence, makes most of the first half, which is character rather than action orientated, somewhat thin and slow burning. It gets better at the halfway mark when the action shifts up a gear but this is only superficial compensation for a screenplay thats terrified to offend any religious persuasion and so won't be drawn on detail of the conflict. All in all its just pretty faces and slaughter, available for free for those wiling to brave the streets of Penzance on a Saturday night. A lifeless dud.",Kingdom of Heaven
154,johnny-08,Bad casting in movie full of holes,3,9 September 2007,"I watched ""Kingdom of Heaven"" knowing only that Orlando Bloom is in main role and nothing else. Not even who direct it or who else acts in this one. After movie I saw that Ridley Scott directed this attempt of historical movie. From my view this movie isn't good because of lots of things. From actors to director. Great Ridley Scott directed this movie with lot of mistakes and lots of scenes that I didn't like. It's tragic that in 145 minutes we still have plenty of scenes that are stupid and too much. There is lot of cutting and some scenes of battle are just cut of(like that big scene when Guy is taking his army to face the Muslims). And the whole script is so poorly taken on screen with lots of scenes that aren't logic. Balian isn't even at his wife's funeral, instead he's making swords. Somehow a blacksmith (Pirates...) knows how to fight in a battle with professional soldiers and of course he's the best and greatest, and all of that is Orlando Bloom. Oh, come on. Simply impossible.That is a problem of casting. Orlando Bloom is not for the role of Balian. Scott's ""Gladiator"" is brilliant movie and it is brilliant because of great casting. Russell Crowe is hero, not Bloom. Bloom is always second actor in big, spectacular movies and that suits him just fine. In ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" Johnny Depp is big shot, in ""The Lord of the Rings"" Viggo Mortensen is our main hero, in ""Troy"" Brad Pitt and Eric Bana are strong and big soldiers. And what is Bloom in ""Troy""? Weak man and that is his right role in historical movies like ""Troy"" and what it should be in ""Kingdom of Heaven"". When Bloom is great warrior people are smiling but why people aren't smiling to Russell Crowe, Viggo Mortensen, Brad Pitt, Eric Bana or genius Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. Imagine Orlando Bloom as Achilles, Aragorn, Hector or Maximus. I don't know about you but I just can't do that. I also didn't like Eva Green in her role, but Jeremy Irons, Edward Norton, Liam Neeson and Brendan Gleeson are great. What else can you expect from such established actors? Ridley Scott really disappointed me this time.",Kingdom of Heaven
155,Rathko,"Beautiful, But Empty",5,9 May 2005,"Ridley Scott is able to effortlessly orchestrate an action sequence. So effortlessly, that you get the impression that he could do this stuff blindfolded and you can't help but wonder when he's going to try and stretch himself as a director. As is usually the case with these recent historical epics, the technical crew does an outstanding job. The Arthur Max/Janty Yates combo creates a beautiful vision of the medieval world. Perhaps too beautiful, as rarely do we see even a glimpse of the plague-riddled squalor that was 12th century Europe. Some real opportunities were missed in showing us glimpses of life in Europe, whether in village hovel or knightly castle. The CGI rendering of the towering city of Jerusalem is, however, spectacular, and the climactic siege of the city is the movie's highlight.The actors were universally let down by an appalling script. Veterans like Liam Neeson and Jeremy Irons are able to give such tedious garbage the sound of authority. The memorable characters that David Thewlis and Edward Norton are able to create despite of, and not because of, the script, are testament to their talents. The younger, less experienced actors, Orlando Bloom and Eva Green, require more assistance in the form of compelling characterization and a supportive director. William Monahan, whose first screenplay this is, seems unable to provide such assistance with his screenplay, while Scott himself is, as ever, more concerned with visual spectacle rather than intimate character building.In interviews, Monahan has stated that he doesn't believe in the 'rules' of screen writing and that his scripts are organic and free flowing. His naivety is all too apparent. Even half way into the movie the audience still has no clue as to what these characters want or why they are behaving the way they are. The story, if it can be called such, is merely a series of seemingly random events, which though true-to-life and perhaps suitable for art-house indy films, is no way to construct a truly satisfying narrative.Bloom, despite objections to the contrary, looks the part, and is clearly at great pains to distance himself from the stigma of the prancing elf. While he seems to struggle to summon the depth or range of emotion required, it's difficult to truly judge his performance when the character he is supposed to bring to life is so weakly written. As is becoming so common, the glittering package of expertly crafted design and CGI proves to be a hollow bauble. Overall, though a better movie than both Troy and Alexander, Kingdom of Heaven is still a disappointing experience.",Kingdom of Heaven

The cinematography is gorgeous, the music is good, not extraordinary. Great art and set direction and fabulous costuming. It's pretty long at 3 hours and 9 minutes, but I found that tolerable, although in a theater I might've suffered from a numb rump. I've seen this four times now and it gets better at every viewing. As usual, being from Minnesota, I'll never get used to ""movie snow"" which looks like feathers or instant potato flakes. When will they get that right?

158,arthurclay,It was good but certainly over hyped to the max,7,14 June 2005,I saw it opening weekend and I was expecting more from Ridley Scott. I have enjoyed most of his films and perhaps I was expecting too much from this. A real downer is the lack of a final battle scene they build up to it and do not deliver. But most noticeably missing is the love scene you could pick that out of a lineup for not being there. Why take it out? I know it was supposed to be racy and sexy but it was part of the story so why not just cut the romance out entirely that would leave more time for action but no we have to have the romantic interest that's what Hollywood is all about right? I am not an expert on Jerusalem or the Crusades by any means and I do not claim to be but it appears there is a glaring number of historical inaccuracies depicted in this film and Scott has been accused of this many times during his film making career. One reviewer on this site listed several which were substantial. And the producers of this movie are being sued by an author who by strange coincidence wrote a book depicting this story a full year ago yet received no credit or money. I left the cinema thinking this was just a two hour photo shoot for Orlando Bloom who is a weak lead and substandard A-list actor at best. They certainly could have found a young yet better talented male than him I have no doubt about that. They just didn't look very hard. The rest of the cast was fine but he wasn't. Too bad they could have made a real winner out of this and an Oscar contender.,Kingdom of Heaven

How both sides used 'God' to justify war, murder, cruelty and greed. Taught by his newly discovered father (liam Nielson) Bloom has a set of strong values as a Knight. Protect the weak, tell the truth even if it costs your life. etc. In one of the old 1960's westerns Bloom would have worn a white stetson, whilst the baddies had black stetsons.

(sound familiar?)His final test is the defence of Jerusalem against Saladin's overwhelming army.",Kingdom of Heaven
161,oshram-3,The Crusades as coffee table picture book,5,8 May 2005,"Kingdom is at its heart a Ridley Scott film; plot and acting be damned, I'm going to make a pretty movie. This dedication to cinematic beauty has garnered Scott a devoted following, and I will give him credit that at least he stays true to his course as a director. But some of us who sit in the seats (though judging by box office returns, increasingly few of us) actually like to use our brains when we watch a movie, and sadly, Kingdom doesn't give us much of a chance to do that.The movie centers around Orlando Bloom's character, Balian, the son of a famous knight (Liam Neeson) who journeys to Jerusalem in 1184 to atone for his sins and those of his late wife. Once there, he gets caught up in the intrigue between the good leper king of Jerusalem (Ed Norton, though you would never know it) and the evil templars, led by Guy de Lugnisan (played by one of my faves, Marton Csokas). Of course Balian gets caught in the middle of this conflict. There's also a subplot with Guy's arab wife, Sybilla (Eva Green).Kingdom is as you would expect a gorgeous spectacle, with knights and Saracens and, blessedly, a battle you can actually follow (Scott's attempts to ape Saving Private Ryan in Gladiator were an embarrassing, confused mess. He does far better here). Though the chaos of war is aptly captured, we can follow the proceedings fine, and the final battle is one of the better sequences in the film. We get sumptuous views of the desert, and of the teeming metropolis of Jerusalem, and of blue-lensed France, which looks as dead as the underworld next to the profusely colorful Holy Land. The production design is top notch and stunningly realized.I was also pleased with a lot of the casting. Aside from Csokas, whom I'm always glad to see, Alexander Siddig, best known as Dr. Julian Bashir on DS9, pops up in a moderate sized role, looking older and wiser and, well, perfect in his part. Brendan Gleeson, whose work continues to please, also shows up as a one-note evil templar. And Jeremy Irons, who has been guilty of some of the worst overacting I've ever seen, is as sharp as ever I've seen him here as Tiberius, aid to the leper king.One of the problems that plagues Kingdom is that the core of the film is less interesting than what surrounds it. Bloom is a nice guy and a decent actor, but he's simply outclassed by the likes of Neeson, Gleeson, Irons, etc. Balian is never well-sketched  we never really know what makes him tick  and as such is far less colorful than almost everyone around him (he's even sort of flat compared to Green's Sybilla, who is badly miscalculated herself). I don't particularly blame Bloom  though a more talented if less charismatic actor probably could have done more with the part.What makes Balian so uncompelling is the other serious flaw with the movie, a flaw you find in many films of this ilk. Simply put, Balian is a modern character with modern sensibilities thrust into a period piece. Nearly every other character fits in with the scenery and mode of the times (even if they are sometimes a little simplistic, like the snarling Guy); Balian is an anachronism, acting as a modern hero would act, but as a man reared in that world could not even imagine acting. This might have been okay if everyone had acted that way, but every other character except Sybilla is crafted to carefully fit in the world of 800 years ago. Balian's championing of modern values means he's cast adrift like a piece of flotsam on the tide; and such a character can never hope to be the anchor the picture desperately needs him to be. Kudos to Scott and everyone involved for a very even-handed showing toward Islam (the major villains are Christians, not Saracens, and Salah Al-Din comes off pretty well here), but without Balian grounding us the way he should, we aren't ever sure who to root for. When Salah Al-Din besieges Jerusalem at the end, it's damned hard to root against him (as the picture half-heartedly encourages you to do) because, well, Balian just doesn't rouse one's sympathies.The performances vary. Liam Neeson plays the Qui-Gon/Batman's mentor role just fine; my only complaint is that he's not in the film long enough. Irons, as I said, is excellent, easily the best and most subtle performance in the picture. Csokas and Gleeson, both of them fine actors, and reduced to Saturday morning moustache twirling, a disappointment, and Eva Green never really nails Sybilla. Sometimes her charisma comes across, but other times she seems out of place and uncomfortable. Bloom himself is bogged down in the morass of a weak script, especially as regards him, and struggles through the whole picture to make his presence felt but fails. I don't really blame him  he demonstrated ably in Troy that he can hold his own in large cast period epics  and while a more seasoned actor might have been able to do a little more with Balian, the fault for his blandness can hardly be laid at Bloom's feet.This is definitely a movie you'll want to wait for the DVD on. That way you can enjoy the pretty scenery and the fairly engaging battle and have the ability to skip some of the less enjoyable parts of the picture. Kingdom of Heaven could have been a great film, but in the end is merely serviceable, a picturebook of the crusades with little deeper impact.",Kingdom of Heaven

You know why things are happening. 40+ minutes of important scenes not only deepen the story and the characters, they make the story more seamless and whole. Acting is good. Orlando Bloom is decent enough, but the presence and authority of Liam Neeson, Edward Norton (though his mask does half of the job), Jeremy Irons and Ghassan Massoud (Saladin) could alone carry much of the movie. Thumbs up.Cinematography is, like in any Ridley Scott movie, beautiful. There are still a couple of things that bother me, even with the director's cut. SPOILERS: Balian starts his journey not only for himself, but because of his late wife, fearing her suicide would condemn her to hell. It's hinted how he might get over it and how he comes to view religious bigotry, but I wanted to be force-fed with a conclusion, maybe Balian giving a speech to his late wife or something. We don't get that, and now he's just a man who goes on a journey and just succeeds in everything he does, we don't get to see him struggle that much or dive into the character. Bloom isn't bad, but his character isn't handled as well as I would've hoped. Also, the child king vanished too quick. His illness is brought to light, but they get rid of him too fast. These are the only things that bother me, and in a 3-hour epic, it is more or less forgivable.I'll give this a strong 8, might change it to 9 if I see it again. I'm glad I got the extended cut on blu-ray from a sale somewhere. It's clearly better than the mess it was before. One of the best epics I remember seeing. Not a masterpiece, but it isn't too far from being one.",Kingdom of Heaven
163,bob-rutzel,Entertaining,8,21 October 2005,"Balian, (Bloom) a blacksmith is found by his father, Lord Godfrey (Neeson), and taken in to become a knight who promises to help defend Jerusalem.Basically, this is a war between Christians and Muslims. The Muslims want Jerusalem, which is controlled by the Christians. The movie was difficult to understand for the longest while because it was assumed the audience knows what was going on to begin with. Names and places are thrown about quickly like we know who and where these people and places are. Maybe it was a problem with the audio. It took me quite a while to put it all together. But, let's face it, how many of us know the history of 1180s in the mid-East. HUH? One thing ultimately becomes clear and that is the defense of Jerusalem. Once you know this, you can enjoy the movie without trying to remember names and places. It is the leader of the Muslims, Saladin (Massoud) against Balian. A better script in the beginning could have made things clearer, but I wasn't there to help out. In many ways Massoud steals the show as he is shown to be quite the leader, and he has huge screen presence.The battle scenes and cinematography in general are outstanding. The music at the end reminded me of the Japanese group KODO performing. Why was this at the end when the credits were running? It should have been at every battle scene to give this epic more OOMPH! Who decides these things? Orlando Bloom does an acceptable job. When I heard he would be in this I wondered if he would have a beard. Without the beard, nothing would work. He just wouldn't fit without a beard. Well, he must have read my review of The Last Samurai with Tom Cruise (for whom the beard worked), and he had a beard. I would have given him a bushier beard, but I wasn't consulted. A bushier beard would have given him a stronger looking face. You have seen Orlando Bloom without a beard, haven't you? Yes, he does an acceptable job, but he needed to be more animated at times and wasn't. Also, his elocution and diction were too refined for a blacksmith. He needed to be more terse and demanding at times as leaders are sometimes. But, like I said, he did an acceptable job.Eva Green is very beautiful and does a good job. Every time she appeared I had to ask myself 'who is she?' She had a different look every time I saw her and I am not talking about clothes. I knew a girl who could be in ten pictures and when you looked at the shots, you would swear there were ten different girls. Eva Green has that ability. I guess it's an ability.If you are a history buff, you might want to check out the accuracy of the historical facts of the time. As for me, I don't care too much. And, hey, we are talking the 1180s here. Perhaps if it were closer to our time now, I might be upset. I am in this for the entertainment aspect and the idea that Saladin really didn't have 200,000 men to storm Jerusalem doesn't bother me.I assume Saladin's army traveled with those wooden towers and catapults. I mean we are looking at a desert here. Some of the most amazing fireball shots are seen in this movie as they are slung from the catapults. You would think that meteors were slamming into everything. Very, very impressive.Overall, a good show. I was entertained.",Kingdom of Heaven

165,Barky44,"Interesting and entertaining, but not extremely memorable",7,15 May 2005,"Kingdom of Heaven is a good film for a rainy day. It has action, excitement, and interest. The story is fine, the cinematography is fine, the acting is fine.The problem: it's just ""fine"". The film isn't incredibly memorable, it won't go into the annals of filmdom like Lawrence of Arabia or Lord of the Rings or Gladiator.I think the problem is the film misses its attempt to have an emotional core. It's primary focus is on the politics of the situation between the Christians and Muslims and the kings of both sides. But all films require an emotional core around the central characters to work well, or it's just pages out of a fictional textbook.Therein lies the film's problem: it doesn't have an emotional core. The writers mention the tragic loss of the lead character's wife, and there is a very touching scene on the Mount, but then the matter is subsequently dropped. The writers mention the need of the lead character to redeem himself, and it is barely mentioned again until the very end. This redemption does have a nice payoff at the end, but by the time that happens you've forgotten all about it. There is also a minor plot element regarding a romance between two characters, but that too is almost forgotten until the end (where there isn't the best payoff).Part of the problem is the writing, but part of the problem is Orlando Bloom. He simply lacks the passion to be a lead character. He is fine in the broody, silent, reflective moments, but he does not project any sort of passion when required. He can't portray anger, or grief, or inspiration, or joy very well. It's something he should clearly work on, it's going to keep him back from truly being a great actor.The film does have redeeming moments, such as the siege of Jerusalem and the humor only brothers-in-arms could create, much less appreciate. The cinematography, set design and costumes are beautiful, and the action is believable and exciting yet not gory.Basically the film is fine, but is held back from greatness by the lack of an emotional base. 7 out of 10.Barky",Kingdom of Heaven
166,extravaluejotter,Kingdom of Pointless,1,22 July 2006,"It's not often that a director like Ridley Scott gets things wrong, but when he does, oh boy...The basic message of this film is that some people believe one thing and some people believe something else and if you leave them to it, they'll gladly kill each other for their dogmatism. If you're looking for ""Profound"" look elsewhere. ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is an excuse to showcase the pointless violence and savagery of the Middle Ages in Widescreen with Surround Sound and 1500 extras.The fight scenes are breathtakingly violent and well-staged. Scott and his team learned how to do this in ""Gladiator"", another big dumb so-called ""Historical"" movie. The only plus point for ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is that the sight of men carving away at each other has never looked more real. You may flinch at some points because the horror of the hand-to-hand combat in ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is palpable at times.What makes this movie so bad if it has an acclaimed director at the helm? It is a trudge through cliché, with every turn of the plot signposted. The same criticism could be levelled at ""Gladiator"", but that film was carried forward by Russel Crowe, Joaquim Phoenix and a host of fine supporting actors. Unfortunately instead of a charismatic dynamo like Crowe, in ""Kingdom of Heaven"" we are presented with Orlando Bloom as the hero.Orlando Bloom has been known to act occasionally, but he does not have the depth of experience or talent to be a leading man yet. In this film he sulks, mutters and/or shouts his way through every scene. He is upstaged by every supporting actor, from Kevin McKidd (no mean cardboard cutout script repeater himself in other screen dramas) through Michael Sheen, David Thewliss, Alexander Siddig and of course those seasoned old hams, Brendan Gleeson, Liam Neeson and Jeremy Irons. The film has no centre. Bloom's limited charisma makes his rendition of a saintly knight of old as believable as his uncanny elvish shooting ability in the ""Lord of The Rings"" trilogy. How far can you coast on boyish good looks? Orlando Bloom could probably retire on the money he's already made from his movies, and I hope that either he does or he works much harder on his acting skills. The siege towers had more screen presence than Bloom in this film.With no-one to carry us with them through the story, all that is left is to nitpick the technical inaccuracies, gape at the Hollywood physics of the siege tower domino sequence, goggle at the pointless violence, marvel at the insipid romance between Bloom's character and some smoky-eyed Keira Knightley clone and wonder if we wouldn't be better off learning about religion from more informed sources.The end titles make the point that there is still no peace in the lands surrounding Jerusalem 900-odd years after the Crusades. Perhaps Ridley Scott and the scriptwriter would have served us better if they had shocked us with the sickening butchery and pointlessness of a more recent religion-driven conflict in North Africa, rather than trying to teach us a redundant history lesson.",Kingdom of Heaven
167,skymovies,Braveheart in the sun,7,4 May 2005,"Enjoyable though it is, there is nothing in Kingdom of Heaven that hasn't been done equally well, if not better, in Braveheart and Scott's own Gladiator. Granted, the whole production is handsomely staged and the battle scenes are impressive but on those scores it simply cannot top Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings trilogy. And Scott's film doesn't just whiff of familiarity, it positively reeks of it.Consider the plot: ordinary but principled man loses wife, joins a noble cause, is embroiled in a snowy forest ambush, witnesses a mentor die in a veiled chamber, becomes a peerless warrior and tactician in no time, enjoys a dalliance with a beautiful royal, thus upsetting her war-loving husband and even encounters a leper. Stop me if you've heard any of these before...What the movie needs is a believable hero. What it has is Orlando Bloom, who gives it his best but fails to convince as a great leader of men. His rallying call of ""Come on!"" hardly commands the attention like Mel Gibson's ""Freedom!"" speech or Russell Crowe thunderously demanding ""Are you not entertained?"" It's like watching Tim Henman trying to inspire a packed football stadium.And for someone who so frequently extols the virtues of having a pure conscience and mental fortitude, Balian is remarkably unfettered when it comes to fornicating with a married woman. The script stirs up a sandstorm of cute moralising and theologising that the characters largely ignore, especially when it comes to upholding political correctness (newsflash: Muslims and Christians have never really seen eye-to-eye).As a history lesson, forget it. But in terms of action-adventure, be entertained. And then forget it.",Kingdom of Heaven
168,jaxbubba,Wait for the Video,6,25 May 2005,"This is a good, but not great Ridley Scott film. After the like of Gladiator, why would anyone ever do another film of the same genre, unless you were Cecil B. DeMille.The film, though grand in nature, has great cinematography, but lacks the heart or caring required to give this film the edge it desperately desires. The film follows the life of Balian of Ibelin (played by Orlando Bloom). As the film begins, Balian (a blacksmith by trade) has recently lost his wife to suicide. Believing that he can atone for his sins, and the sins of his wife's suicide; Balian joins the ranks his newly found father, Godfrey (played by Liam Neeson) on his quest to protect the helpless, safeguard the peace, and work toward harmony between religions and cultures, so that a kingdom of heaven can flourish on earth in Jerusalem.While en route to Jerusalem, Godfrey is wounded in a skirmish resulting in his impending death. Balian is sole heir to Godfrey's land and belongings. Once in Jerusalem, Balian pledges his alliance to the reigning, but dying King. Given the opportunity to become the next in line for the throne, Balian declines the offer; only to have the incoming King declare a Holy War against the Islamic hordes. In a badly miscalculated maneuver, the new king leaves Jerusalem only to have the Islamic hordes slaughter his troops in the desert.Balian, heavily out-numbered, with no knights or expertise to speak of, must defend Jerusalem from the murderous faction fastly approaching the city walls.The battle sequences are tremendous, and what you have come to expect from a Ridley Scott production, however, the storyline was weak and left me wanting more.My suggestion: Wait for the Rental Scale of 1 to 10: Six",Kingdom of Heaven
169,Freedom060286,Great Cast Wasted On Badly Written Story,4,25 May 2020,"This movie would have been better if it had simply followed actual history. Despite the wonderful cinematography and great cast, the poorly-written story made it difficult to watch by times.The movie is very anti-Christian. The Templars are shown to be heartless killers. The priest in the first part is portrayed as evil, and the Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem is portrayed as a despicable coward (the historical record describes him as the very opposite, he was actually a very brave and honorable man). In contrast, the Muslims are all portrayed as decent, wise and honorable people.Balian was nothing like the character in the movie. He wasn't a blacksmith, he was older, and he was at odds with Sibylla, not her lover. She actually loved her husband, Guy de Lusignan, who was not killed by Balian and wasn't the villian we see here, although he wasn't a wise military leader as we know from the Battle of Hattin. Guy was given lordship of Cyprus in 1192 by Richard the Lion-hearted. And finally, although Raynald was very aggressive, he wasn't an insane fool as shown in the movie.Rather than using contrived dialogue and the same silly stereotypes we've seen in too many movies, it would have been better if they broke away from the political correctness and made the characters and events more realistic.",Kingdom of Heaven

And he is capable of managing these huge undertakings and still have a clear directorial vision shine through.Intelligent use of sound and camera and beautiful art direction delivers pure eye candy. Never since Andrey Rublyov were the Middle Ages so well depicted. Scott's trademark constantly moving camera is also present again.In the battle scenes (note the arrows from Kurosawa's Ran and how Scott outdoes the Helm's Deep section of the LOTR) there are often two main positions: the first is from above, creating beautiful mosaic-like patterns, hereby referring to battle and movie-making as art (painting); the second is on ground level, showing how ugly war really is. This is congruent with the audience being out or in the movie.I was less impressed by the writing of the new wonder boy William Monahan. It reeks of a bit too much kitsch and tries to hard to copy the writing style of the LOTR, which is a fantasy and not a historic account.The writing is the main reason why Orlando Bloom has a hard time in this role, although it's anyhow almost impossible for him to stand up against the high society of British acting.

I cannot really say I did not enjoy Kingdom of Heaven since it entertained me most of the time (I watched the ~3 hours long directors cut), but it turned out a bit dull at times.Orlando Bloom is a great actor indeed, yet I am not sure whether or not he is suitable to play such a hero as he is supposed to do here, since the flick is an epic after all and thus require a special type of character to take the lead. I read similar comments here about whether or not he is suitable, but I leave that for you to decide. At any rate, I think he is not.To execute such an epic tale which is set in such a special environment is a very difficult task, I would say - but I think the director and the staff did a decent job here, especially when it comes down to the great battles. The amount of violence depicted is pretty well balanced. It is not too much nor an absence of it, and there were moments when I feared unnecessary amount of violence to be depicted, yet there was none at those times and the flick took a different turn than I had thought.This flick is not among the top 10 flicks of 2005, yet was entertaining - and - at least it got me further interested in the Crusades so I decided to do some more reading on it.6/10",Kingdom of Heaven
175,FilmSnobby,Hollywood willed it.,2,11 May 2005,"A fractional improvement over Ridley Scott's previous historical epic, *Gladiator*. Even so, American audiences seem disenchanted with *Kingdom of Heaven* anyway: it pulled an anemic $19,000,000 for its opening weekend. (I think even Stone's wretched *Alexander* had better opening numbers.) This doesn't surprise me. A year ago, writing a review here at IMDb for *King Arthur*, I prophesied that audiences had gotten their fill of incalculably massive computer-generated armies clashing into each other in front of blue-rinsed and butter-basted camera filters. This year, I'll add speculation to the prophesy: in air-conditioned, cologne-reeking executive offices all over Hollywood this week (5/9 - 5/13, 2005), buffed and polished dudes, wearing $3000 suits and sporting $500 haircuts, are crumpling up screen treatments for new historical epics and tossing them in $1200 elephant-skin trash-cans.And who can blame them? Ridley Scott has made a pretty lousy movie, here -- the perfect reward for those who continue to insist that his previous historical epic, *Gladiator*, was a good movie. Hey, you get what you ask for. In point of fact, *Kingdom of Heaven* is actually a slightly better movie than the other one because its subject matter, the Crusades, is inherently more interesting and certainly more relevant for today's times, as opposed to some wheezy plot-line about a hero seeking vengeance for his slaughtered family. But leave it to Hollywood, always genuflecting before an ephemeral ""bottom line"", to ensure that a movie about as explosive a topic as the Crusades will manage to dodge anything that hints of controversy. Kind reviewers will remark that Scott's film attempts to be ""impartial"", but that's a misdiagnosis. The movie clearly makes villains -- for no clear reason -- out of the Knights Templars, while, curiously, making heroes out of the Hospitalers who, even more curiously, are not mentioned once by name in the movie. If Scott was really into impartiality, he would've dared to provide a Muslim parallel to the Templars -- perhaps a splinter-group of a mainstream Muslim sect who lusts to commit genocide as gleefully as their Christian counterparts. In other words, a 12th-century version of al-Qaida. I'm a little shaky on Islamic history of this period, but certainly not EVERY Muslim of the time was such a gentlemanly knight-errant as was Saladin (played memorably here by a fellow named Ghassan Massoud). Certainly there were those in the Muslim camp who advocated extermination of the Christians, just as the Templars in this film advocate ridding Jerusalem of Muslims. Experts in the field are invited to correct me all they want to, but the fact remains that, in the film's universe, actual history is pretty much a plastic item, whose main justification for Scott seems to be the excuse to build absurdly expensive sets. In other words, with so much historical material being changed and/or fabricated, DRAMATIC justice still demands 50/50 impartiality . . . which Scott shamefully pretends doesn't matter. He's mincing on eggshells of political correctness, here. The result? -- a ""humanist"", rather than a religious, philosophy; anachronistic nonsense about freedom of religion (and just plain old freedom); and an overall sense that we're being preached at. ""What shall be torn down?"" our Hospitaler hero Balian hectors the multi-culti citizens of Jerusalem. ""The Wall? the Mosque? the Church? Who lays claim to Jerusalem?"", before going on to suggest that people of ALL creeds and religions belong there. This guy is holding a press conference at the U.N., not rousing the citizens to defend the Holy City against the infidel.Setting aside the gripes about 21st-century blather flowing from the mouths of the movie's 12th-century heroes, let it be said at once that Orlando Bloom, who has been fine in supporting roles in the past, lacks the presence required to carry a film this bloated entirely on his own back. His Balian is strictly a Russell Crowe role. We may be thankful that luminaries such as Liam Neeson, David Thewlis, Brendan Gleeson, and Jeremy Irons are on hand to back the kid up . . . and we may as well be equally ungrateful that their forceful screen-presences are too briefly seen. We miss Neeson in particular, who is the sacrificial lamb here, pretty much as he was in *Gangs of New York* (which also could've used more of him). I did enjoy the King Baldwin character, a leper swathed in holy white robes and whose face is hidden from view by a striking silver mask (though I did NOT enjoy Edward Norton's uppity, Boston-Brahmin-like vocal characterization). ***Brief spoiler follows: But count on literal-minded Ridley Scott to ruin the mystery of the King by showing us the King's face after he dies. Scott doesn't understand that this character feels more genuinely 12-century on the screen than any of the director's tiresome battle scenes or set designs. Leave SOMETHING to our imaginations, Mr. Scott!*** I could go on with a windy surfeit of words about the movie's many other inadequacies, but I'm running out of space. Let's just say the summer blockbuster ""season"", which each consecutive year seems to commence one week earlier in May than the previous year, has started with whimper rather than a bang.

176,jaredpahl,The Thinking Man's Action Epic,8,8 September 2018,"*This is a review of the Theatrical Cut of Kingdom of HeavenKingdom of Heaven belongs to a rare and esteemed lineage of Hollywood film. It is a historical action epic, like its Ridley Scott directed brother, Gladiator, of real substance. Like Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven delivers a generous serving of action (this time with Medieval battles providing most of the excitement), but the moments of Kingdom of Heaven that stuck with me were, more often than not, the smallest bits: Textured character work, thoughtful dialogue, or a subtly touching performance. I don't want to scare off any action fans. Kingdom of Heaven is no ""talky"", but amidst the clashing swords and whirling fireballs are things not always seen in action epics. Things like themes and morals and emotions. In other words, a dash of sophistication.Set in the Crusades and spread across Middle Ages France and the Holy Land of Jerusalem, Kingdom of Heaven focuses on a blacksmith named Balian (Orlando Bloom) who, at the behest of his father, Godfrey (Liam Neeson), joins The Crusades to find redemption from God for his past sins. The journey to Jerusalem reveals a true ensemble of characters from both the Christian and Muslim sides of the conflict. While Kingdom of Heaven has been talked about as a ""controversial"" story about the relationship between Christianity and Islam, there isn't really much controversy to this movie. Both sides are given fair portrayals to the point where neither comes out looking villainous. It might have been easy to disregard the Muslim point of view, and even easier to take a shot at the Christian's motivations in The Holy Land, but Scott and screenwriter William Monohan find something honorable in the Christians' mission to take back the city of Jerusalem.The ensemble cast in Kingdom of Heaven is one of its greatest assets. As the protagonist, Orlando Bloom gives another sturdy heroic performance. His role is bigger here than in his other blockbusters, but like in Pirates of the Caribbean or Lord of the Rings, the strong supporting performances mean Bloom doesn't have to push. He hits a comfortable zone and carries the film well. Liam Neeson, Brendan Gleeson, and Jeremy Irons are all wonderful in small, but rich supporting roles, but I have to give a special mention to the film's best character. The Leper King, King Baldwin, is the greatest thing to come out of Kingdom of Heaven. Hidden behind an ornate metal mask, he is immediately captivating visually, but more so than that, King Baldwin is the film's most tragic figure. Monohan has said in interviews that the entire project stemmed from the idea of The Leper King, and it is easy to see why. The image of a living king concealed by a statuesque funeral mask is simply haunting, and the performance is legendary. I won't spoil who is doing the acting (I was physically shocked when I found out, and you should have that experience as well), but through only voice and body language, he creates a deeply empathetic character. For those more concerned with action, the best compliment I can give Kingdom of Heaven is that its battles are as good or better than the gladiatorial combat in Gladiator. Ridley Scott tones down the disorientation that crept into that film, and doubles down on scale. The best set-pieces are a violent ambush in the snowy French forests and the large-scale siege on Jerusalem that the entire film builds to. Both these sequences are heaven for a Medieval warfare enthusiast like myself; not perfectly realistic, but brutal, bloody, and frequently creative in how they imagine battle tactics. Of course, these are not the only action scenes. There are a number of smaller skirmishes along the way; more than enough to scratch that itch you might have for full blown Medieval swordfights, without elves or orcs or sorcerers (just how I like it).Yet even with the great action scenes, Ridley Scott's 2005 epic is almost more potent as a drama. The story presents ideas and rewards close attention to detail, and the performances are crafted with as much care as the stunts. In the end, there is just a lot to admire about Kingdom of Heaven. You don't have to ignore the drama to enjoy the action and you don't have to ignore the action to enjoy the drama. It is not quite to the level of Gladiator, which had a stronger central story, but it is in the upper echelon of historical epics. Bring on the Director's Cut!85/100",Kingdom of Heaven

178,samseescinema,Count Kingdom of Heaven as strike four for the Epic Genre,5,19 May 2005,"Kingdom of Heaven Reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com Rating: 2 out of 4 Count Kingdom of Heaven as strike four for the Epic Genre. Following in the deeply imprinted footsteps of Troy, King Arthur, and Alexander, Kingdom of Heaven puts to shame a director whose earlier films have been events to look forward to. Wolfgang Peterson (Das Boot), Antoine Fuqua (Training Day), Oliver Stone (Platoon), and now Ridley Scott (Gladiator) have all played victim to this current trend of disappointing historical period pieces that rely heavily on budget but forget to give the screenplay the final polish they need. Epics now have become a sad joke in the film world. Finding people willing to pay eight dollars to see Kingdom of Heaven with me was actually difficult. Because of the last year's disappointments, the Epic now equals boredom. Kingdom of Heaven is no exception.Set in 12th century Jerusalem, Kingdom of Heaven focuses on one man's journey through the controversial wars known as the Crusades. We meet our hero, Balion (Orlando Bloom) in a decrepit village working as a blacksmith in the wake of the death of his wife and child. His father, Godfrey (Liam Neeson) arrives on the scene and asks him to join his army on their way to Jerusalem. At first he declines, but after being disowned by the village priest, and later killing him, Balion takes up his father's offer. Soon he finds himself in the position to become king of the Christians and take command of the battle for Jerusalem, along with his mistress Sibylla (Eva Green).When I studied the Crusades in my high school history class, the most interesting aspect of the text was the controversy behind the fighting. The Crusades wore a veneer of religion and holy honor; but behind this mask lay endless depths of political and financial intention. Millions were brought to their death in the name of the salvation of their holy land, only to find their holy land was a ruse for their leaders to find profit. I'm just touching the surface here, but the Crusades were controversial! Entire nations of men lost their faith to the horrors of the Crusades. But Ridley Scott touches on nearly none of this. He veers his film in the opposite direction, one of simple battle mounting to a final showdown at Jerusalem. The film turns into Muslims vs. Christians, Round 1, 2, 3, and 4. Scott lets Kingdom of Heaven lapse into the dredges we've waded through in Troy and nearly drowned in with Alexander. I want an Epic with heart, not incoherent battle scenes that leave us bored and slightly disgusted at the piles of stringy decapitated bodies.Scott goes to such lengths to avoid historical exposition that if there weren't crosses on the fronts of every soldier's costume, I'm confident audiences could go the entire length of the film without realizing it was set in the Crusades. His last venture into the historical genre was the Best Picture winning Gladiator. The film took the Oscar not because of its abundance of action sequences, but because it succeeded in weaving complex political intrigue into its harrowing story of revenge. Kingdom of Heaven tries none of this. There's a gold mine of potential here, but Scott sadly ignores it.This would be acceptable, however, if Scott managed to make Kingdom of Heaven into a successful film about a war and its hero. Instead, Orlando Bloom and the immensely talented Eva Green are left with hollow characters that are never given the chance to fully bloom. The film rushes through the opening hour to come to a screeching halt at the battle for Jerusalem, where half the film takes place. Not only does this screw with the pacing, making it awkward and clumsy, but it also leaves the two main characters nearly unknown to the audience. We're only allowed to really ""experience"" Orlando Bloom's character in the heat of battle. But by that point, it doesn't matter because we have nothing to relate his violence to. Scottt tries to get us to see that he fights for his redemption, not for his religion, but this theme fails because we're already alienated from his character by the rushed beginning. The same goes for Eva Green's character. Her relationship with Bloom is built in a measly two scenes that leave much to be desired. Their characters rely on these two scenes for the rest of the film, making their interaction lackluster at best. By no fault of the actors, Kingdom of Heaven ruins any chance of the audience's interest in its characters. And in a near criminal fault, Liam Neeson's pivotal character is killed off in the opening 35 minutes, again a consequence of the rushed first half.As in all these hollow Epics, the ill-fated director still has a hand for the visuals. Kingdom of Heaven is no exception to this rule. In one scene, Neeson and Bloom are practicing sword-play in their camp hidden in the forest. Snow drifts slowly down from the evergreen pines, swirling about their swords with each jab and parry. A knight approaches and warns of orders to have Bloom taken prisoner. Seconds later a line of crossbowmen rise and fire golden arrows through the camp, piercing one man in the neck. This sparks a gorgeous combat sequence, where Scott takes a page from Gladiator and uses frame-skip editing to make the violence jumpier and exponentially more visceral. Scenes like these are what make Kingdom of Heaven bearable. It may lack intelligence and any sense of character development, but the film does sport some great visuals and a few exciting battle sequences. Does this make it worth seeing? No, you'll still be left with that disappointed feeling you had at the end of King Arthur, or Alexander, or Troy. But maybe the next epic will cure this.

What is the focal point, and what is well conveyed is an immersion into a unique time and cultural era, with its various complexities, conflicts, and intrigues which very much shaped the history that has led to our current world.As for the production itself, the scenes and camera work are absolutely first rate."" Ridley Scott received many letters of thanks and congratulations from Muslim groups for his even-handed depiction of the religion. "" I can believe that, as I was keenly aware of the delicate nature of portraying this history in such a production, but came away with the feeling that this was a genuinely even-handed effort to deliver this theatrical vision of the time.As for the cast, where to even start?Well, the short version is, A+ crew throughout, don't think this could have been cast any better.But for my personal favorites here, hands down top of the list are Liam Neeson, and Eva Green.Of course, I freely admit I could watch either of these two in just about anything, and not be lacking for joy in the experience.Having said that, the performance of everyone here was absolutely spot on.

180,btm1,Better than just great battle scenes.,7,12 June 2014,"I'm not a fan of action movies that spend heavily on crashes, fires, and other special effects, but skimp on the screenplay. Kingdom of Heaven, however, is an action epic about who rules Jerusalem at the time of the first Crusades, but with a decent and interesting plot. While it contains some historical characters, it is a fictionalized account. One of the things that is historically correct is that King Baldwin (actually Baldwin IV) did have leprosy, was retained as king despite that, led troops in battle and even defeated Saladin in one. Also, when the King was still young, he did have a regent, Raymond III (1140-1187), Prince of Galilee and Tiberias, who the film only calls Tiberius (Jeremy Irons). Also, princess Sibylla (Eva Green), sister of Baldwin IV, did marry Guy of Lusignan and there is some historical claims about her involvement with Baldwin of Ibelin, but not Balian of Ibelin (Orlando Bloom), who actually was a younger brother of, and vassal to, Baldwin of Ibelin. But there isn't anything in the few historical sites I looked at about Balian ever being blacksmith.Liam Neeson, as usual, impresses, although in relatively short part, as Godfrey of Ibelin. (The actual name of the historical father of Balian of Ibelin is not Godfrey but Barisan.)What makes the plot interesting is the moral code of the hero, (played by Orlando Bloom) and his father. It gives a morally sympathetic treatment of Saladin and Islam; its treatment of Christianity favors Christ's teachings about doing good being more important than rituals, and mocks false piety of a medieval Christian priest and bishop.",Kingdom of Heaven
181,eastbergholt2002,Disappointing,6,13 May 2006,"Ridley Scott has made four or five truly great movies, but unfortunately this wasn't one of them. The film is about the Crusades and the recapture of Jerusalem by Saladin and his Muslim army in the 1180s. The film looks great and this is a topical subject given the current tensions between Islam and the West but it's ultimately a little disappointing. Balian (Orlando Bloom)is a grief-stricken French blacksmith, whose wife has died. He is visited by his father (Liam Neeson) and invited to help him protect the Christian occupied territory in the Holy Land. Neeson is a soldier and a close adviser to the King of Jerusalem. Neeson is killed on the journey and Bloom inherits his father's position and troops.The Christians occupy Jerusalem, but the Muslims control most of the Holy Land. There are two different views amongst the Christians on how to deal with this situation. The détente faction led by the King (Edward Norton), Tiberias (Jeremy Irons) and Balian want to co-exist and favor appeasement. The Templars, who behave like cartoon baddies, want to provoke confrontation. They figure that God is on their side so they can't lose. The Templars are evil with an un-Christian passion for killing and mutilation. The Muslims seem reasonable by comparison. Their leader Saladin is depicted as a wise and shrewd general who respects the beliefs of Christians. Bloom has a romantic relationship with the king's sister (Eva Green). She is also married to the Templar's leader, Guy de Lusignan. The king cannot fully control the Templars and you question his decision to pick Balian, a village blacksmith, to lead his armies. The king is also a leper who wears bandages and a striking silver mask. Ridley Scott is usually great at casting his films but Bloom just doesn't have the charisma or the natural authority the part demands. Unlike Gladiator, none of the acting performances, apart from Norton's, is particularly memorable. The battle scenes are exciting and the movie is good to look at. But the story telling seems rushed and the characters are not fully developed. The film probably needed to be an hour longer. Although based on true events, the story didn't seem believable and doesn't really explain what the Crusaders were doing in the Holy Land. Perhaps the director's cut will make more sense.",Kingdom of Heaven
182,Ishallwearpurple,"Orlando baby, you're pretty, but no actor-----",7,2 June 2005,"The main problem with Kingdom Of Heaven is the 'main' character is so bland that we really end up not caring a whit what happens to him. In fact I nodded off at one point, but jerked awake in time to see Bloom do another scene where he is seriously serious, but that scowl is boring after awhile.The scenes of battles between the crusaders and the Arabs are spectacular when they are lined up across a huge span of desert, but after we get in close as they battle and do hand to hand, it is soooooo confusing that you end up not caring.There is a woman involved - already forgotten who she is and who she is supposed to be - and in the love scene between her and Bloom they cut away so fast we barely see a kiss. Say, what? Maybe they didn't like each other or it was so bad it was left on the cutting room floor.I love stories about the crusades but this is a dud. 6/10 for Jeremy Irons, the cinematography and costumes.",Kingdom of Heaven
183,KOOLAIDBRO,This is for the Director's cut,10,9 July 2020,"The theatrical version is OK. I might say a 6 or 7 rating.
The director's cut is one of those things after you watch it you question how people are actually getting paid to edit movies down. I get it. Not everyone is going to sit through 3 hours and 14 minutes and it is going to hurt the bottom line. The longer the less showings also, but when you tear a movie down and make it slightly above average when it was a masterpiece? You need to let it roll.
If you have watched the theatrical version and you liked it than you have to watch the director's cut. It's 45 minutes longer and it should be. You will not even consider watching the theatrical version ever again. I choose to act like it doesn't exist at all. If you haven't ever watched this movie WATCH THE DIRECTOR'S CUT!

184,Filmdokter,A film that only impresses without its boring protagonist,6,12 July 2021,"This is my review for the Director's Cut. I saw the theatrical release back in '05 and was quite disappointed. I heard good things about this directors cut. And although it is an improvement from the original release, it's still not flawless and not one of Scott's best films. The main problem is the protagonist Balian. His Big Issue (backstory) is cliche and not fleshed out well enough. Balian is played by Orlando Bloom (a big star back in those days) who isn't the best of actors, to put it mildly. His acting is wooden and Edward Norton (who is wearing a mask throughout the film and we only see his eyes) impresses more with just his voice and eyes than Bloom. Thankfully the cast is completed with (character) actors like Jeremy Irons, Eva Green, Brendan Gleeson and David Thewlis. When they take centre stage, this film really impresses. The political and physical battle for Jerusalem is far more interesting than Balian's character arc.",Kingdom of Heaven
185,fearfulofspiders,"Good Story, With Terrible Pace...",5,20 September 2008,"Unlike the very engaging story that is Gladiator's, Kingdom of Heaven was more intriguing, and a huge letdown more than anything. Once again, Scott has made us a gritty R-rated history film with lots of blood, which only adds to the dramatic effect here and there, whereas else, it detracts.The acting is pretty good. Liam Neeson, Edward Norton, and Orlando Bloom steal the show -- especially Norton as the leper king of Jerusalem. Brendan Gleeson is stuck in his Troy role, and Jeremy Irons, while adequate, his character's screen time is just too short to comment on.The music is average. It doesn't have any scope, and only one theme manages to capture one's ears. Harry Gregson-Williams' score focuses far too much on subtlety, but when the action arrives it pretty much sounds like previous compositions of his -- one of which, a future release, The Chronicles of Narnia, in which the two sound very similar.The writing is okay, but with all the events leading up to the big battle, there's hardly any action to soothe one who is falling asleep in their chair. There's little skirmishes here and there, but they only last a couple minutes, and then it's back to more debating. The final battle particularly is very bad. The wide angle shots aren't original, and the editing of the armies converging into battle is so poorly edited, how Scott thought this would pass as viable entertainment is beyond me.All in all, I'm not keen on history so I can't tell you if this is accurate or not, but the story as a whole is very good and the ending is very thought-provoking. However, if one is looking for action along the way, then they will be sorely disappointed, as tension is the only lingering substance of excitement we get.I only recommend this to someone who needs to see it to believe it, a Ridley Scott fan, or a fanatic of historical times.",Kingdom of Heaven
186,blackburnj-1,"A Fantastic, Beautiful Film. A Flatulent, Flabby Script.",8,8 May 2005,"Ridley Scott's crusade epic looked good from the moment we got our first glimpses of it. But there were fears over its quality. The biggest fear was that the film's lead, Orlando Bloom, would fail miserably. This was followed by fears that it would be considered racist or anti-Muslim. The film doesn't fail here at all, and is a stunning, beautiful piece of cinema that is unfortunately let down in one area.The film must be praised in its technical excellence. The beautiful cinematography, sets, visual effects etc. dazzle the eye and absorb the audience in their splendour. The music varies from brilliant to a little but over done, but it is strong on the whole. The editing becomes a little confusing at times in an attempt to cover the myriad of characters.And what of the people playing those characters? This has to be the strongest ensemble cast since ""The Lord of the Rings"". I am sure that there could have been people better suited to the part of Balian than Orlando Bloom, but he delivers his strongest performance to date and I left the cinema with him in much higher esteem. Eva Green is unfortunate in having a part that is really non-essential and spends most of her time looking on but she takes on her task well. Jeremy Irons is superb, David Thewlis splendid, Liam Neeson underused but fantastic, Edward Norton is just awesome in the hardest part of all, and Brendan Gleeson and Martin Csokas are just wonderfully vile as the two war-mongering yobs. But the best performance comes from Ghassan Massoud, as Saladin, who is just oozing suavity, charm and brilliance in every shot that he is in.However the films sole problem lies in its script. William Monahan has a wonderful ability to write great dialogue but his structure is appalling. We never really find out what is driving Balian, which just adds to his complete lack of believability (as a Blacksmiths go, his pretty poor, but when it comes to defending Jerusalem, he's your man). Meanwhile all of the other main character arcs are poorly developed (apart from Edward Norton's King Baldwin) and the plot is just wholly insane in places.But taking the script as a starting point, Scott has done superbly with a film that couldn't be any better. His direction remains genial, artistic and touching. It is a tour-de-force in film-making, that is worthy of Oscar recognition when the time comes.",Kingdom of Heaven
187,colonel_green,All hail the Leper King!,7,10 May 2005,"Ridley Scott, who kick-started the return of the swords and sandals epic with 2000's ""Gladiator"", now returns to the genre with ""Kingdom of Heaven"", set on the cusp of the Third Crusade. The story takes historical character names and settings, but plays fast and loose with the details, and ends up coming out pretty well. Orlando Bloom plays Balian of Ibelin, a French blacksmith who is the illegitimate son of Godfrey of Ibelin (Liam Neeson). Bloom is probably the film's weakest actor. He just doesn't bring the same ferocious intensity that Russell Crowe brought to General Maximus Decius Meridius. Bloom is surrounded by a phalanx of gifted, seasoned performers, including Neeson, Jeremy Irons (as Tiberias, the Marshall of Jerusalem, who in real history was Count Raymond III of Tripoli), Ghassan Massoud (as the legendary Muslim warlord Saladin), Brendan Gleeson (as the dastardly Raynald de Chatillon), and ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine""'s Alexander Siddig (as Nasir, an aide to Saladin). Eva Green, in the film's only significant female role, is Queen Sibylla of Jerusalem. The film is fairly well stolen by Edward Norton, who gives voice to King Baldwin IV, the young and wise King of Jerusalem, who is afflicted with the hideous disease of leprosy. Norton gives his whole performance behind an ornate silver mask, but creates the film's best character. The battle scenes are spectacularly staged, although the fact that Scott wants us to empathize with both sides makes it difficult to get in to at times. The ending is rather weak. All in all, I give ""Kingdom of Heaven"" a 7/10.",Kingdom of Heaven
188,axismladen,"It's far away from being a masterpiece but still,directing is simply flawless!Ridley's best 'directed' movie!!!",8,28 September 2009,"I always thought Ridlley Scott is one of the best director's today.First he got known as a master of low budget movies and then he started making a big budget movies.I thought it will,as it does with many directors,ruin his creativity!Luckily,it didn't!He is still the same old Ridley!A man who made Thelma & Louise,Alien,Black Rain,Blade Runner...and so on...He's made plenty of masterpieces over the year's including some of his new stuff such as The Gladiator and Black Hawk Down.I must say The Kingdom Of Heaven is far away from being as good as Gladiator or some of his other work,but still it's a decent movie that's obviously been influenced by some other movies such as Braveheart.When i first saw The Kingdom Of Heaven,i knew it's not the best picture material.However,i was almost certain that Ridley will be nominated for the best director.Unfortunately he wasn't.He should have been and he should have won!This is Ridley's best directed movie and i honestly doubt that he will ever direct any other movie as good as he did this one.That's what really pisses me off!!!So many director's over the year's deserved the best director nomination's but they didn't get it because their movies were not the best picture material's.I think that's just not fair!

190,ereinion,Weak yet insightful,6,28 December 2006,"""Kingdom of Heaven"" is basically a weak movie, but it gives a good insight into the history of the Crusader wars and the Arab resistance, a topic I always found interesting. What keeps it from being a well recommended movie is the trite sword and sandal nature that mirrors the one of ""Gladiator"", although the direction is less focused than in that film and has less top class actors. The only real treat here is Jeremy Irons who plays Tiberias, an unknown name to me and probably a made up character, loosely based on some actual historical person.Orlando Bloom is not the best choice as Balian, but he makes a plausible effort. Liam Neeson plays his father and enhances the little screen time he has with his powerful presence. The unknown Velibor Topic and Eva Green as Sybilla are the most pleasant surprises, while the ridiculously clichéd villains Csokas and Gleeson are trapped inside their poorly written roles. Edward Norton is also featured, but not seen, as the leper king Baldwin. Thus one can only say he ""spoke"" well.This is the first movie where the Crusaders and Arabs are shown from an objective point of view. Is it really objective to make all Arabs the good guys and all Crusaders except Balian, Tiberias and king Baldwin the bad guys? Maybe so, but still Lusignan has been made too much of a stereotypical villain and Balian a stereotypical hero. The final battle scene is maybe the only real treat of this film, although it too could have been better. Yet it powerfully underlines the whole issue and the cause of Saladin and his people. Balian: ""What is Jerusalem worth to you?"" Saladin: ""Nothing. Everything!"" This issue can be traced to this very day.",Kingdom of Heaven
191,Monotreme02,"Good, well-made but ultimately unsatisfying and forgettable",8,27 October 2005,"Ridley Scott's new epic film, ""Kingdom of Heaven"", starring Orlando Bloom and Eva Green, is good, but at the same time disappointing. I'll start with the good things.Ridley Scott has already established himself as an acclaimed visual director. He stood at the helm of such visual masterpieces as Blade Runner, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, and others. His technical genius shines in Kingdom of Heaven as well. Each shot is carefully and cleverly set up and shot. The photography is, in one word, gorgeous. The sound and the editing are perfect. Ridley also doesn't hesitate to use computer-generated imagery, which looks excellent (and far less obvious than in, say, Troy, for example). The costumes are excellent, and the set design/art department clearly knows what it's doing. Visually, the film is as good as it gets.The actual direction is also great, as we could expect from Ridley. Large crowds are very skillfully dealt with on screen, and Ridley directs the action of his characters (and all the extras) with utmost attention to detail and aesthetic value.The acting is also excellent. The movie is blessed with an excellent supporting cast (with such great actors as Liam Neeson, David Thewlis and Jeremy Irons). Also, hats off to Syrian actor Ghassan Massoud, who plays Saracen leader Salah al Din with such class and presence. But it is in the lead acting where the movie starts to stumble. It's not that it's bad, in fact, it's perfectly fine, and there's nothing at all wrong with it (which is surprising, considering that we're talking about Orlando Bloom here). Orlando and Eva just can't carry a movie. I was very reluctant to do this, but I will do it anyways  I will compare Kingdom of Heaven to Ridley Scott's masterpiece from 2000, Gladiator. Russel Crowe and Connie Nielsen had an incredible presence on the screen. They had enough screen power to lead such a grand epic such as Gladiator. Orlando Bloom and Eva Green lack this screen power to lead as large an epic as Kingdom of Heaven.And the movie just gets weaker from here. The script is not particularly good. It's not bad, but it's not excellent either. One of the things that shone in Gladiator is the brilliant script. Russel Crowe's character, Maximus, and the motives for his actions are so well established, that we identify him from the first minute of the movie up until the last. Orlando Bloom's character in this movie, Balian, lacks these motives. It isn't quite clear WHY he goes to the Holy Land; it isn't quite clear how he suddenly became an excellent leader and warrior; it isn't clear at all how his position in the Holy Land is established. He is sort of thrown into this situation without asking too many questions, and since he is the main character, the audience goes through this experience as well. We are thrown into the movie and the plot, as opposed being willingly pulled into it, which is something that well-crafted movies achieve. The dialogs are wooden and not original  it's all stuff we've heard before.The movie is also horribly historically incorrect, although this is a fact that shouldn't bother the average moviegoer, unless he starts quoting this movie when it comes to Middle Ages history.Which brings me to my last point: The overall impact of this movie. After I left the theater, I already started to forget Kingdom of Heaven. It didn't leave any serious mark on me. I came, I saw, and I left with practically nothing. I will probably completely forget the movie in a few months. It will be left forgotten in cinema history, and I have a theory why. Gladiator came just at the right time. The cinema world NEEDED a good old-fashioned, well-made epic. Its precise timing added to the overall impact and effect of Gladiator, and is what made it so memorable: People hadn't seen a movie like it in quite some time. The Lord of the Rings trilogy took this historical epic film-making seen in Gladiator and took it one step further. And all epic movies made since Gladiator/Lord of the Rings were forgotten. They were ""just another epic movie"", and they were all just as boring. Sure, they were well made, but their impact was minuscule. Movies like Troy, King Arthur, Alexander, and so on are bound to be completely forgotten. And it hurts me to say this, but unfortunately, Kingdom of Heaven also falls into this category.If Kingdom of Heaven was to come out in 5 years from now, or if it were exceptionally good, it might not be doomed to be forgotten. But under these circumstances, and to sum it all up, Kingdom of Heaven is a good, well-made but ultimately unsatisfying and forgettable movie. I do recommend seeing it in theaters, though, merely because that due to its technical aspects, it should be experienced in the cinema, and not on the small-screen.",Kingdom of Heaven

Norton in particular is wasted as the King delivering some simple lines but without much drama. Neeson is also hardly used with a short appearance and very little acting required.Bloom is fine in the lead role and carries it quite well, he plays an understated hero in an understated way and makes it believable but his character is not a very interesting one and hanging the whole film on such a simple character was not a great idea.Gleeson brings a bit of life to proceedings with an air of violence but he plays a small part and can't save the film from blandness.The key problems here are the writing which supplies no surprises and no decent dialogue and the directing which offers very little beyond pretty scenery.All in all a waste of a good cast and potentially good historical setting.",Kingdom of Heaven

194,CherryBlossomBoy,Kingdom of excellence,9,20 June 2013,"I'm prone to call this ""the last great Scott's epic"". At the time of this writing Ridley Scott is still alive (unlike his brother), but judging by his latest work he'll never be able to pull off something like ""Kingdom of Heaven"" again, so I'm pretty safe with the former assertion.Very few things are not good with this film. There is excellence in every department. Ridley Scott is master of visual storytelling and juxtaposition, beautiful cinematography and slick use of music and cast.In this film the story leads us from cold blue overtones of France to warm, sunlit vistas of the Middle East. From existentialism of ""the Seventh Seal"" to grandeur of ""Ben Hur"" - it's a hell of a journey. Right the way an average Christian pilgrim, fed up with hardships of medieval Europe, might have seen it back in the 12th century. And this is where this film is the best - at capturing the spirit of times it's depicting.Even the screenplay was good this time around (something ""the Gladiator"" and ""Robin Hood"", for instance, were terribly lacking). Many detractors complained about abundant historical inaccuracies in the story. I might have been one of them, but I did enough of research after watching to conclude that the real historical events surrounding Kingdom of Jerusalem and its fall are so complex they would put ""Game of the Thrones"" to shame. Cramming the whole thing into two hours worth of film and keeping the attention of the audience is a joint achievement of screen writing and directing that eluded even some of the classics of the genre.The cast fits the roles perfectly. Orlando Bloom, whom I jokingly called ""pussy Legolas"" prior to this film, proved to be a very good lead. There's the eye candy Eva Green and a palette of brilliant character actors, Irons, Neeson, Gleeson, Massoud... A special and eerie treat is Edward Norton whose face is never seen but whose presence is very much felt.Of other things worth praising there is music that serves the story well, there is meticulous art design and costumes, and last but not least, signature Scott's cinematography - shot in such a way you could take any frame out of it and hang it on a wall as a beautiful painting.Probably the only peeves I have with ""Kingdom of Heaven"" are an extremely unfair portrayal of the Knights Templar and the fact that depth of characters is somewhat sacrificed to the clarity of the story.It's an extreme rarity for me to go see the same film twice in the theatre. This one I did. I suspect that, had the director's cut been released instead of the producer's, I'd do it a couple of times more.",Kingdom of Heaven
195,vishal_wall,Once upon a time in the Jerusalem,1,29 November 2005,"If you think you can digest a stylish 'Once upon a time in Jerusalem' then kingdom of Heaven is a treat. Orlando Bloom wearing designers, walking on the ramp with American swagger talking with accent and 'am I looking cool' look. If you can sit through that your day is made. There is absolutely nothing in the movie worth mentioning except for Ghassan Massoud as Salah-ud-din (I don't know what's Saladin) and depiction of the Salah-ud-din as a great Muslim leader. The whole character of Balian is fictional or a historical disaster. I don't understand how people make such irresponsible movies on important topics like Jerusalem. I was actually very impressed with the film but when I did some online research on Balian I realized that film was absolutely fictional like 'Gladiator'. Movie has tried so hard to show Balian as not a crusader I don't know for what reasons. He travels from France to Jerusalem to find his place in history? How historically incorrect is that? Riddley Scott forgot to mention about Balian's brother Baldwin, who was the actual lord. Important details are missing like Balian was the adviser of Guy of Lusignan, Balian gave his word to Salah-ud-din that he will leave Jerusalem and then didn't keep it. It is an amateurish movie. I think director couldn't find a personality to match up with Salah-ud-din and so he just changed history. How cool is that? Last scene where Richard the Lion heart meets Balian is so childish that I laughed at it. If you care for history then you would refrain from this disaster. It is pointless to talk about the cinematography or editing of a historically incorrect historical epic. 1 on 10.",Kingdom of Heaven
196,TheNabOwnzz,A mediocre piece of propaganda for cultural relativism,4,22 April 2019,"Ridley Scott has in the past directed masterpieces such as Gladiator, Blade Runner & Alien, but it seems that nearly everyone in the end falls victim to the leftist Hollyweird curse that seems to be going on around there, and he has decided to create a film not as something of artistic merit or entertainment value, but as a highly subjective propaganda piece depicting his corrupted ideals.Admittedly, Kingdom of Heaven is still beautifully photographed, and features superb cinematography ( With the exception of a couple of easy to notice greenscreens, and a lot of badly saturated sequences during the catapult attack in the battle of Hattin ). The production design is also very good, and at least it seems as though visually Scott's quality has not diminished in this film.So, technically Kingdom of Heaven is not a bad film, but in terms of substance, the audience is left wanting. Orlando Bloom's Balian is a Mary Sue, a seemingly perfect moral character with no obvious flaws. Of course, he does kill a priest at the start ( Who apparently was his own brother aswell ) in an absolutely laughable sequence, giving him the obligatory 'absolve my sins' character arc that has become such a cliché. Apart from this sequence, he is a complete Mary Sue, resulting in a completely uninteresting, superficial character. ( The priest didn't matter anyway... since Christian priests are EVIL! )We do not care about Balian's plight, because he is a cartoonish nonsense character as to what Scott considers to be 'a good Christian'. Of course, Orlando Bloom also plays him with absolutely zero emotional intensity. He is a wooden plank, and should stick to smaller supporting roles such as in The Lord of the Rings, because this man cannot lead a movie. His supposedly poignant scenes with King Baldwin are a joke because of him, and his 'romance' ( If you can even call it that ) with Eva Green's character has absolutely no charisma whatsoever.Of course, the only real bad guys in this picture are Templars high in fanaticism or ignorant Christian xenophobic priests. The only 'good Christians' are the ones that are struggling with their religion, putting the 'people' before everything else, even their religion. The Muslims are depicted as victims, and their siege near the end is being justified by Scott by showing us these atrocities the Templars have committed, such as destroying a convoy of unarmed civilians. As everyone with half a brain knows, this is pure fantasy. Historical accuracy is being sacrificed for a ham-fisted social message that is not only naive, but extremely dangerous. ( At the end of the real battle of Hattin, many Christians were sold into slavery by Muslim leader Saladdin, but this little detail is of course left out ) It is obvious that this is all influenced by modern day events where the left villainizes patriots concerned about their own country, and i think ( Because of the title card near the end stating that Jerusalem still has this dispute 1000 years later ) that the film is not just an assault on Christianity, but also on Jews to be more 'open-minded'. The Templars are also complete morons, as there is a scene in which a small Templar force attack an entire Muslim army. Of course, on the contrary, the Muslims are depicted as intelligent & sophisticated. It really becomes an utter joke of cultural relativism ( The principle that all cultures are equal, and compatible with eachother, which history has already deemed to be false at every turn ).Apart from the obvious moral self exaltation, we are also subjected to a final hour which seems like a literal ripoff from The Lord of the Rings, as some shots are nearly indistinguishable from Jackson's masterpiece. However, since we have a main character not worthy of relatability since he is horribly acted and written as a modern day Mary Sue, there is no emotional connection to this sequence at all, leaving it dead and lifeless. Of course, visually and technically there is nothing wrong with it, but Kingdom of Heaven is indeed one of those pictures to which you can apply the term 'Style without substance'. Scott has also admitted himself that the whole point of this movie was to show that 'Not everyone in the West is good, and not every Muslim is bad', showing us his total lack of focus on cinematic quality, while instead focusing more on creating a heavy handed social message. There is even a scene in which Saladdin picks up a crucifix, and puts it on the table as a sign of respect for their religion ( Subtle, Scott.... real subtle... ). Again it's kind of a young boy's fantasy in how Scott sees this world.Kingdom of Heaven is a visually and technically excellent film, but does not have any substance whatsoever. The entire plot is driven by leftist subjective social messages that will not impress nor fool the intelligent viewer, while creating such a naive muddled morality in the character of Balian that it really only becomes a laughing stock piece of propaganda.",Kingdom of Heaven
197,shweta-51657,"A true historical drama, well worth the watch - BUT ONLY the Director's cut!!",8,18 October 2018,"I should start by saying this movie is a rather long one, but not one scene is wasted. Its almost nearly historically accurate. Ridley Scott has tackled a rather controversial biopic, albeit taking a few liberties with the storyline for dramatic purposes. Among the movie, what I found that stands out most is the depiction of battle. After watching movies your whole life you are nearly numb to it but this movie has done it refreshingly well. Some battle scenes of the movie left my mouth hanging open, a feat only achieved by LOTR previously. So many of the cast are names and faces you will recognise, it is a shame they did not have more screen time! Liam Neeson, Jeremy Irons, David Thewlis, Brendon Gleeson and Michael Sheen, all were such a pleasure to watch, I wish they had more screen time.Another thing that stood out, was the acting of some of the lesser characters! Negative characters played so dastardly well, it was a pleasure watching them on the screen.You tend to forget what an amazing visionary Ridley Scott is, but this film has firmly reminded me he is one of the greatest directors of our time. 
A good film, a serious topic, a fantastic director and a stellar cast.",Kingdom of Heaven
198,jaybizman,Kingdom of Heaven: Another Ridley Scott Epic.,9,13 November 2020,"From IMDB: ""Balian of Ibelin travels to Jerusalem during the Crusades of the 12th century, and there he finds himself as the defender of the city and its people.""Almost a masterpiece, in the same vein as Scott's ""Gladiator.""
Orlando Bloom, IMO, was a little too lightweight in this movie, who travelled
to The Holy Land after a terrible personal incident, with his (newly found father), Liam Neeson, as the Baron of Ibellin, with 300 men. Standout was almost-newcomer Eva Green, who with her Gothlike dark looks, Mona Lisa-like smile and mesmerizing eyes, was amazing as Sybilla, Queen of Jerusalem.The Crusader Knights would cry ""God wills it!"", before hacking Muslims to death. My own opinion is that such treatment of an indigenous people would turn them against you for Centuries, and NO God would will such a thing. This is made clear by several participants in the movie.The Muslim Emir, Saladdin, was well played by veteran actor Ghassan Massoud, who IMO, came off the best, both with his attitude and humility. Other standouts were the truly evil Marton Csokas (from the first Xander Cage, XXX, movie) as Guy de Lusignan, and Jeremy Irons as Tiberias. Last two were NOT historical characters.Massive sets, costumes and battles galore.
IF you can get the Directors Cut - which runs about 30 minutes longer than the
theatrical release (I've seen both), please do - as it fleshes out more about Eva Greens 'Sybilla' character and adds another sad participant in her life.

199,fastmike,Sin City,2,9 October 2005,"The digital age seems to have revived the great Hollywood spectacle. With far fewer ""extras"" than the great cinema epics of the past, and with computer generated images, fantastic scenes that would have required ""a cast of thousands"" and dozen acre sets, can be done for a fraction of the cost and effort.This is the case with "" Kingdom of Heaven "" .Unfortunately, what the new 'DeMilles"" don't realize (In this case the fabulous Ridley Scott) is that you need greater than life performers to go along with the vistas.The most impressive performance was that of Ghassas Massoud, as King Saladin the Great, and he did not even get a top billing! Liam Neeson is well on his way to becoming on of the all time greats. I measure this by the decreasing amount of screen time he seems to be getting. (Brando holds the record with his 12 minute multi million dollar 'Superman' Cameo) All in all, aside from the battle spectaculars, this epic will not carry you along as if caught in the flood of adventure as in the epics of old. In fact it is quite dull.However, with a little imagination, it could have been great, had the film told the story from the Salidin side, with the ancient intrigues and power struggles of those ancient Arabian royal courts.Don't rush out to make this one of your ""Arabian Nights"" right away.",Kingdom of Heaven
200,TexasRedge,"So Powerful, So Very Good",8,29 April 2013,"I was a late bloomer to this movie. Probably because it came out right after we were hit with a string of Medieval, Fantasy and Epic Sword Fighting movies like TROY, Lord of the Rings and others, So much so, that by the time this one came out, I just wasn't interested.(I remember seeing previews and thinking -Been There Done That)About 5 years later, I was at a local flea market and a vendor there was selling DVDs cheap(Alocal Videostore had gone out of business and he had bought out their surplus of DVDs)So I seen this one for sale for only $3. ........The Best $3 I ever spent.I loved this movie. This is a Ridley Scott masterpiece! I loved everything about this movie. I loved the cinematography, I loved the sweeping orchestra musical score, I loved the cast in it, I loved the realistic battles scenes. The story was wonderful(a little predictable-but thats okay-nothing wrong with that). A powerful moving story about a widowed blacksmith who reunites with his long lost father and goes on a crusade to Isreal. In Isreal he finds a new life and a new purpose. He becomes a nobleman with dignity and compassion. And then he is forced to defend Juraselam against an aggressive army commanded by the legendary Muslim leader Salidin. Very well written, well plotted and well performed. (((I kicked myself for having not seen this 5 years earlier))) This movies waaaaaaay better than all of those other Epic Medieval & Fantasy movies that came out the year before.If you love Epic movies, you owe to yourself to watch this one as well. Trust me on that. You will not be disappointed.",Kingdom of Heaven
201,kdavies-69347,A Wonderful Portrayal of Brutal Times.,8,18 March 2016,"The Crusades began in the late 11th Century as the Christian Armies of Europe, responding to Pope Ubran II's cries to go to war on behalf of all Christendom, against the Muslim armies in the Holy Land near Jerusalem. These battles lasted over two hundred years, and are considered some of the bloodiest of the Middle Ages.Ridley Scott Delivers a truly epic historical drama about a blacksmith Balian (Orlando Bloom) turned crusader, and how even a man from simple beginnings can change the world. The brutality of the times is duly delivered throughout the film, and well acted throughout with a fairly dynamic cast of supporting actors. Most notably Liam Neeson as the Knight Godfrey, Edward Norton as the masked King Baldwin, and David Thewlis, the unnamed monk who supports Balian throughout his battles. What he really achieves, and to my surprise is a lack of bias towards both the Christian and Muslim sides of this battle. Both sides retained their own ideologies, but never once does Scott make one side seem to be without principle or merit. Despite what people may feel currently, when I look back on this film, I think it fairly portrays the honour and cruelty of religious ideology on both sides.One of the best achievements of this movie is the lack, or at least reduced use of CGI throughout the film. Every Battle looks realistic, and avoids the pitfalls of subsequent movies like 'Lord of the Rings,' and 'Troy' (of which Bloom also stars). Ever face on the battle field is a different one, and it looks exactly like it should. 1500 dressed in armor, and each with their own weapon, fighting it out for their respective King and Religion. The towers that were used in the siege of Jerusalem were really built using technology from that period of time, and it certainly adds a sense of realism to the movie.Of course it's not without a few minor flaws. I'm usually thrown off by the use of the British accent during historical dramas. I understand the necessity of it, as it connect the viewer to the period, but considering the majority of the Knights during the crusades were of mixed decent (French and Germanic mostly), it can seem a bit out of place (especially when using names like Raynald de Chatillion and such). It's a bit like using an American accent to read Shakespeare. It throws the whole thing off. Additionally, there are several differences between the theatrical version, and the director's cut (being 194 minutes) is noted by the Director as being the 'definitive cut,' so it's recommended to avoid the shorter 2 hour version as it misses an entire act.Undoubtedly one of the most detailed and well portrayed epic films of it's time, Kingdom of Heaven is a beautiful rendition of a brutal time.8/10",Kingdom of Heaven
202,fred-houpt,"Blah, predictable fest for the eyes",5,17 August 2012,"You know I've grown quite jaded after so many years of watching old fashion films and now a whole generation of CGI fakery. I am no longer so stimulated by things blowing up or people hashing and smashing each other with great bloody abandon. (However, as an aside, I did recently watch ""Body of Lies"" and it is fantastic on all levels - a must watch) Anyway, the premise of this film is grounded in history so of course the first question I ask is whether the film adheres to what is known or goes off on the seductive Hollywood nonsense? I have read a few books about this period of time = and I will mention a superb one that covers the year 1000 (close enough in my view) ""Millenium"" by Tom Holland. To really understand what life was like back then you have to do this type of reading. What I find just turns me off about these types of films, including the noxious Ridley vehicle ""Robin Hood"" is that they so quickly abandon history in favour of readily digestible formula's to feed to the public. My point is that a good story can be told without making history up and yet the best of Hollywood is not interested. I mean, if it was Herzog making the film you'd be more certain that history would be respected.I found the physical layout of 12'th century Jerusalem so far removed from what it looked like that I just cringed. I've been to Jerusalem several times and I'm telling you that it didn't look like that back then. Not even close. The one thing that the film gets quite right is the heat and dust in the Holy Land at that time. There are other problems that come to mind about a siege of Jerusalem (and here I'd have to go back to reading the real story to be very sure) but it had a huge underground source of fresh water. Outside of Jerusalem there is no fresh water for many, many miles and true enough, if you strayed from water your troops would die. And so the idiotic Christian troops were doomed.I am also put off by actors who are overly beautiful or handsome in the roles of those who were most likely worn out, bedraggled and ill looking at the time. In short I found the film inaccurate, predictably transmitting plot movements by overstimulating the eyes and ears. The dialogue was underwhelming and the actors appearing to go through their motions, relying on skillful inflections that the action demands. A ho-hum affair and one that I wished a more honest director like Herzog to cover.....In short: boring. Books about this time period still triumph over gratuitous images.",Kingdom of Heaven
203,Pingo-2,Review of the extended version.,6,4 March 2007,"I haven't seen the ""real"" version but only the Extended Directors Cut of KINGDOM OF HEAVEN.The film is about a blacksmith-turned-knight who finds himself fighting both Christian knights as well as Saladin's Muslim warriors.If I was a Christian American, I might have found this concept extremely interesting in times like these, but now I am Swedish and not particularly interested in the conflicts between Christians and Muslims, so for me it becomes a bit dull and partly obvious.I love knights and films that try to portray knights within a true heraldic sense, and KINGDOM OF HEAVEN actually does a pretty good job there. The costumes, weaponry and armory are all very true and the heraldic symbols nicely put together.Also the casting and acting is very nice.The bad things - which is also this films largest problems - lies within the story itself and the directing. Sure, it is a visually nice (not stunning) movie, but it is extremely overlong and parts of it are just repeating itself and feels unnecessary and out of place. The first hour and a half, would have, in any other film, been concluded within 10-30 minutes. I am not particularly found of the super-slow pace in the films start, which makes the ending too feel slow since you're pretty tired then and wants it all to end.The end battle is not very well done. Scott wants to show a siege over a few days, but it doesn't work in the movie. It just makes the battle feel like a cut-up action-sequence and completely ruins the battle pace. This is truly not a new GLADIATOR and if you have any needs for cool action, then this flick will be a great disappointment.For anyone who wants to watch a 3-hour drama with knights and dust, then this is your kind of film. Especially if you're interested in a movie that shows Christians and Muslim as equally stupid and equally brave. The film does a very good job to show that neither side is evil or good - but that there are good and evil people among them both. This is a nice break from the regular slur you get from lower budgeted movies, and this is also the reason why I give it a 6 out of 10 instead of a 4 or 5.The action sequences - few but nice - are entertaining. Historically, this is just a piece of bull, but as a tired piece of entertainment, with good actors, it is a fine film.I am not sure on what Scott's intentions were with this movie, and I sure won't try to find out. This is not a film you will watch again. Watching it once is nice, but lets leave it with that. Not a classic, but at least average.",Kingdom of Heaven
204,Mr_PCM,The end of the Epic era,7,8 May 2005,"Ridley Scott's return to the epic genre feels like it should be the second coming. After all, it was Scott himself who breathed life into the 'Sword and Sandals' films with Gladiator. Gladiator was a rousing adventure with a spirit that has not quite been recaptured in a succession of attempts including Troy, King Arthur and Alexander. So can Scott work his magic a second time?Kingdom of Heaven is certainly a valiant attempt and you can see what he is attempting. The set pieces are excellent, in particular the siege sequence far outshines anything comparable in Gladiator, and is reminiscent of the now fabled Helm's Deep siege in Lord of the Rings. But the plot feels convoluted, at least at first, and by the time you make sense of who is fighting for who and for what, the film is nearly two hours in. Furthermore, there is great ambiguity over the morality in the film, who is good and who is not? Who has just claim to Jerusalem? But a question that has perplexed diplomats the world over for centuries isn't likely to be resolved in a 2 1/2 hour film. But a film such as this needs clear heroes for audiences to root for, and accompanying clear villains. The lack of said distinctions detract's from the film's pace and power.The plot idea is a good one, and it has certainly been a while since the crusades were tackled, at least on this scale, and that is no bad thing. But with a run time of 145 minutes, the story needs to keep the audience on edge and unfortunately the film feels rather stretched out. As a result the long running time is really felt.The other main question that was always going to be asked of this film is can Orlando Bloom carry a film on his own? He certainly makes a very good effort, and he obviously has talent, but he is still reliant on a strong cast around him. Liam Neeson provides the perfect early foil, David Thewlis is an excellent mentor who pops up occasionally to impart kindly wisdom, and the ever-dependable Jeremy Irons is, as always, excellent. Bloom has certainly improved on his rather wet showing as Paris in Troy, gaining a much-needed steely edge. But he still seems to lack the ability (or perhaps the confidence) to instill passion into his portrayal, and his tortured grieving is not quite so heartfelt as it could be.Yet for all the films faults, it is still an exciting adventure, as all epics should be, and the battle scenes are superb. One thing Scott certainly knows his how to stage a good dust-up. Okay so there is no Russell Crowe-type hero to cheer on in a quest for vengeance, but in a tale of this sort, perhaps this is wise. The film carefully avoids making judgment, and also takes great care not to paint the Muslims in too aggressive a light. However, perhaps now the genre should be put to rest for at least a few years, as the feel of overkill is definitely tangible. An exciting film, but stretched too long.",Kingdom of Heaven
205,gpadillo,An Epic Missing Its Soul,5,9 May 2005,"Rarely have I wanted to route for a movie so badly, so heartily as Ridley Scott's new ""Kingdom of Heaven"" and been unable to do so. My fault, perhaps, for expecting too much, but there it is and I'm disappointed. I think Scott himself in an interview hit the crux of the problem for me - in stating that this was something more attuned to an in-depth miniseries rather than a 2 hour motion picture. Scott captures the essence of epic-film-making, but in truth, Hollywood no longer tuned to ""the epic"" doesn't really know what to do with this than market it as a ""summer blockbuster"" and even though given the go-ahead for ""Kingdom"" the inherent strictures assigned to making a ""hit Hollywood epic"" seem to be the very things standing in this talented director's way. ""Give us an enormous, epic motion picture on a controversial subject and bring it in around 120 minutes."" It's simply not possible.Much has been played of the timeliness (or timelessness) of the Christian/Islam mess and understandably Scott wanted to show some balance and tolerance to what is oft a one-sided history lesson, yet, given the constraints of time limits, no real feeling or point of focus for either Christian or Muslim comes across with any real conviction. Time really is the enemy of this film.The first portion of the film easily holds the most interest as we are given the backstory of the father/son relationship between Balian and Godfrey of Iberlin. There is enough material here to develop this story alone into a feature length film. Liam Neeson - larger than life - crams as much knowledge and sage, knightly advice as he can into too brief an episode with his son Balian, played by Orlando Bloom. Sadly, the balance of the film crams in the rest of Balian's Crusade Adventure into balance of the film, and not in any particularly revealing or illuminating way. Again, time stands in the way of allowing anything truly memorable to develop here.Everyone acts up a storm, the CG battle scenes are nothing short of spectacular, lighting, costumes all stunning - a soundtrack of ancient melismatic middle eastern music fused with Big Hollywood Soundtrack style provides appropriate aural cushions and yet, the whole thing feels as though it's missing something.I hate not being able to love this movie, but outside of its trappings of battles, costumes, music and special effects there simply is not enough to love.",Kingdom of Heaven
206,filmbuff-36,"A better epic drama than others, but won't stand out much against the current crop",7,26 May 2005,"""What is Jerusalem worth?"" one character asks another at one point in the film. ""Nothing,"" the other one responds, and then with a knowing grin, adds ""Everything."" ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is Ridley Scott's epic story set during the Crusades, where Christian knights and peasants from every corner of Europe converged on Israel in an attempt to control the Holy Land and fend off the Arab tribes that once help power over the region.A young blacksmith named Balian (Orlando Bloom) is approached by Sir Godfrey (Liam Neeson), his father from an illegitimate relationship, who is heading back to Jerusalem and wants his son to accompany him. Fighting in the Crusades is said to be an atonement for ones sins by the Church, and Balian wishes to save the soul of his wife, a suicide.Along the way Godfrey is mortally wounded, and he bestows his title to Balian, his only heir, charging him with the duties of knighthood. Balian completes his father's journey to Israel, meeting up with the other Christian factions that control the city of Jerusalem. Baldwin IV (Edward Norton), the king of Jerusalem, fears for the future of his kingdom. Terminal due to leprosy, the king wishes to maintain peace with Saracen king Saladin (Ghassan Massoud), whose forces outnumber the Crusaders 10 to 1.The Knights of Templar, fanatics in Baldwin's courts who frequently raid Arab caravans, are in danger of upsetting the balance and launching a war. The passing of Baldwin soon puts one such Templar, Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas), becomes the new king due to his marriage to Baldwin's sister Sibylla (Eva Green), and plots to unleash his new acquired forces on Saladin. However, his campaign is a disaster, which leaves Balian in charge of defending Jerusalem.Scott is certainly a director who knows how to mount an epic, probably the best since Cecil B. Demille, and ""Kingdom of Heaven"" certainly has all the right elements in place for a grand historical film. The direction, set design and costuming are all elegant and make for awesome medieval story.But the movie also suffers from some PC tampering as well. Based loosely on a true story, the movie seems fit to change around some of the details to make certain characters more noble than they probably were. We're shown a Holy Land where Muslims, Christians and Jews co-exist peacefully, except for the more extremist elements in the Christian and Muslim camps. Balian in particular is shown to be fairly open-minded for his time, but in real life Balian had little problem killing the Muslims within his own walls. The film's a bit far-fetched but perhaps not completely unrealistic, still it doesn't ring true for the era.Acting is fairly decent across the board. Thanks to his work in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and ""Troy,"" Bloom can play the epic role in his sleep. What he lacks in dramatic range he makes up for with charisma. Jeremy Irons's presence is welcomed as Tiberias, one of the few Christian lords in the film not wrapped up in fanaticism, and Norton's role, while small, provides a tragic look at how decent ideals may have sustained the kingdom.As Sibylla, Green seems to exist for the purpose of a trite and ultimately meaningless romantic entanglement with Balian, as well as to move the plot along in spots. Massoud on the other hand brings a sense of silent power to his role as Saladin, giving the character strength and decency at times but also a devious streak as well.""Kingdom of Heaven"" presents some excellent fodder for the summer audiences. The battle sequences are epic, with trebuchets decimating walls, arrows and swords flying and body counts mounting on both sides as both the Crusaders and Saracens battle for control of Jerusalem. Both desires for power, religious extremism and prejudice flow from both camps, and modern audiences can't help but sigh that the more things change, the more they stay the same.""Kingdom"" has to deal with the fact that over the last five years audiences have been assaulted with historical epics and the idea has worn out its welcome. The movie features fine storytelling and high ideals, but ultimately succumbs to melodrama. We're left with a story about how possible peace between religious groups was subverted by power-hungry zealots on both sides. If the movie wasn't so knowingly winking at the audience while wallowing in crowd-stirring speeches, it might have been a finer film. What exists instead is an above average spectacle which should enliven audiences but leave them with little new to think about.",Kingdom of Heaven
207,Danimal-7,Okay 21st-century perspective on the Crusades,6,21 August 2007,"The Crusades have lost their old glow of moral rightness, but not their unique sense of high adventure. We may put the name ""crusading"" to either a fanatic or a hero, but never to a stick-in-the-mud. For good or ill, a Crusader plays for high stakes.The Kingdom of Heaven concerns one Crusader, Balion of Ibelin, who comes to the Holy Land seeking forgiveness for his sins, and those of his lost wife. Once in Jerusalem, he encounters a delicately balanced political situation. Baldwin of Jerusalem, the pious, leprous Crusader king, and his loyal marshal Tiberias, seek to keep peace with their Muslim neighbors while keeping control of their hard-won holy cities. Another Christian faction, led by the Templars Guy of Lusignan and Reynald of Chatillon, motivated by both religious zeal and simple greed, seek war with the Muslims. Looming over both factions is Saladin, the formidable Muslim sultan of Egypt and Syria. The dying King Baldwin walks the tightrope between Saladin and the Templars for as long as he can, but he cannot keep it up forever, and when he fails the consequences will be tragic.Despite some deep flaws, Kingdom of Heaven is worth watching. First, it approximates the historical facts pretty closely. Balion, Guy, Reynald, Baldwin, Saladin, and Baldwin's sister Sibylla all really existed, and their behavior roughly resembles that of their historical counterparts.Edward Norton's performance as King Baldwin is magnificent. He is denied the most versatile tool of the actor, his face, spending the entire movie with his leprosy-ravaged features concealed behind a steel mask. Yet he still conveys a fine leader who embodies all the best aspects of the Christianity of his era, and very few of the worst. In Baldwin's Christianity appears the simple, patient faith that enabled him, and many less exalted than he, to bear burdens of pain and degradation that most of us in the modern age cannot even imagine, without becoming sour or embittered. The ever-presence of physical weakness, discomfort, and imminent death strengthens his moral standards, where many in the modern era would use them as excuses for doing wrong. Baldwin is really the heart of the movie, and one of Kingdom of Heaven's chief problems is that it takes too long to get him on stage, and loses its moral center when he exits. Balion, the ostensible main character, is nowhere near as interesting.Like most Ridley Scott movies, Kingdom of Heaven has a lot of visual impact. The colors are beautiful and rich, with the magnificent reds and yellows of the Crusader states contrasting vividly with the somber blues and greens of Balion's native France. The battle scenes have a great sense of scope and spectacle. In the post-Saving Private Ryan movie world, one may legitimately question Scott's decision to make the battles spectacular rather than horrific; the emphasis is always on the action, never on the agonizing and tragic consequences. But, question the worthiness of Scott's objectives all you want, the fact remains that he achieved the grandeur he was aiming for. Less defensible is the choppiness of Scott's close combat scenes, which often end up looking like an R-rated network war game on the verge of lagging.The visual display, sweep of history, and compelling story of Baldwin make up for a number of sins. The beginning and end of the story are vacuous, amounting to little more than a thin frame for the battle scenes. The final act centering around the siege of Jerusalem, fails dramatically (though not visually) for two reasons. First, Balion's decision to defend the city to save the lives of the inhabitants is logically absurd. By his age's rules of warfare, a surrendering city's population was to be spared, while populations that resisted were to be slaughtered, and so Balion's defense of the city endangers the people's lives, rather than saving them. Second is Balion's speech to his troops justifying their battle against the Muslims. It is a good speech, eminently reasonable, but also an absurd anachronism. Balion's arguments are clearly aimed at our age, not his own, knocking down doubts about the rightness of denying Muslims access to a city that was once Muslim. We today have such doubts; hardly any 12th-century Christian would have even considered the question of right and justice for the ""infidels."" Even granting that Balion is a rare exception, he would never have voiced his thoughts publicly in this way.The final production also shows signs of timidity. In a movie that spends so much time on intimate, gory details of every minor skirmish, and whose central story is of how Christianity lost Jerusalem to Muslim rule, what reason can there be for not showing the battle of the Horns of Hattin? Saladin is one of the central characters of the movie, yet his outstanding military achievement is hustled off screen, hinted at but never displayed. And yet the entire premise of the movie depends on this single battle. This choice gives rise to the ugly suspicion that the producers were simply afraid to present Western audiences in this age of the ""Global War on Terror"" a picture of Muslims winning a decisive battle against Christians, and the historical facts be damned.The man who directed this movie also directed Gladiator. Gladiator is much superior, featuring a much more interesting hero and villain, and even more effective and brutal scenes of battle. If you only see one of Scott's period pieces, by all means see Gladiator. But, despite all its imperfections, Kingdom of Heaven is a worthy effort.Rating: **½ Recommendation: Historical epic fans should rent it off the new release shelf; others wait for TV.",Kingdom of Heaven

Violent, action packed and a with a great story this film is a great addition to Ridley Scott's already searing record of great films such as Gladiator. I would call this an epic film as it follows in the footsteps of Gladiator and even 300, I think it is a film that makes you think about how religion can really create divisions and even escalate to violence and death.But Ridley Scott portrays both religions and faiths; Islam and Christinity in fairness and does not accuse one or the other of anything. The fight scenes are well thought out and performed, and really keep to the point of realism and stays true to the era and environment of medieval warfare.

Orlando Bloom plays this very mysterious character very well, all we know is that he wants to be forgiven for his sins so he goes to the Kingdom of Heaven. This is good because know we can see the development from the role of a blacksmith. The rest of the casting was likable and held the film up very well. The battle sequences were amazing, they had such an epicness about them, they were huge and impressive. But, i think that the film lacked a little bit of emotion. Even though the characters were likable and not really to criticise, i think you couldn't truly relate to them or the story. But that does not hinder the high quality this film provides and i would truly watch this to see a good story played out with an amazing cinematography and with an Epic nature about it.",Kingdom of Heaven
211,RichardKleiner,"Not the worst epic film ever made, but it's close",6,29 February 2008,"This was a great idea. To see a more impartial view of the Cruzades, leaning on the Muslim side was something quite original. The problem is that, in order to satisfy the executives, it was edited in the most obscene way you can imagine.I assume that the script was originally more stunning and active with the dialog, as so with the original Ridley Scott's original cut (it seems that Scott always makes an extended version of every film he makes). But, when you see the final version, the whole ""would be"" great monologues and epic language are reduced to one-liners and catch phrases.Some of the characters are quite good. King Baldwin is great, though you can't really see much of Edward Norton's performance due to his mask. Jeremy Irons is, of course, a great actor, and so is Liam Neeson. But Orlando Bloom, perhaps the only bad British actor in history, lacks any personality or individualism. Sybila was an almost useless character.The cinematography and music are both amazingly great. As for the landscapes, I can't imagine how they managed to capture such great skies for most shots. The score was an excellent mixture of good ol' medieval choirs and middle eastern voices.You know, one of the tracks in the soundtracks is called ""The Battle of Kerak"", when, actually, there was never an actual battle in that particular scene. The real action and great battle sequences are in the final scenes of the movie.To that matter, even as it was historically accurate, the whole story was completely pointless. The leper King dies, Guy takes over and finally fights his war, Saladin obviously beats him and is later forced to attack Jerusalem (after defeating the actual King of Jerusalem, that is), and later decides to stop the attack after Balian agrees to his terms: anyone, no matter what religion he is, can pass freely to Jerusalem safely without danger.Apparently, the peace established by the leper King before the siege wasn't enough. And, if you are going to offer a proposal like Saladin's, why would you attack the city first and kill off most of it inhabitants? Due to Balian's strange views on life and death (which haven't been properly explained) he refuses to kill Guy when he could and avoid the same danger he would later be a victim of. We later see, that, when King Richard marches against Saladin once again, he's defeated.I'm not an ignorant. I know that's how it goes historically. But if you have such a pointless and anti-climatic story, why would you bother making it a movie.Of course, the extended version can correct some of these flaws, and that's how it works with Ridley Scott. Can the executives just give him a break and let him make his movies like they really are? The man's good. You don't need to edit them down, just to appeal the ignorant and easily mystified with crap audience.I think the worst part of it all was the editing. It's just so much so fast, you can't even process it or feel the impact the words are trying to give you.It could have been better.",Kingdom of Heaven
212,veganflimgeek,So much better than gladiator,9,30 May 2005,"I am not a huge fan of gladiator and am sorry to see this film was not the hit for Rdiley as his last historical epic. KOH is just a much better film. Beyond that I felt it's message was important. The in case you are too unaware to know this the film ends with a reminder than there is still no peace in the holy land. I think it is great to show the roots of these conflicts a thousand years old.Scott did a great job of balancing out the insanity between all parties involved. All sides of the crusades did in reality have there maniacs and there great leaders. How it is the maniacs who seem to still drive the conflict in Palestine today.As far as film goes it was never boring, well acted and only lost one point with me for the fact that Bloom gave 3 braveheart style speeches to many.",Kingdom of Heaven
213,alexandermangoldt,Did Ridley Scott pay for these reviews?,1,19 July 2006,"I wonder whether Ridley Scott paid for the reviews on IMDb.com because, to my understanding, there is no way that the rating of this movie by almost thirty thousand people still amounts to an average of seven out of ten points. Maybe I should have seen it in a cinema instead of watching it on TV, but I don't think I would have rated it much better. Right from the start I knew that this flick was going to bore the living hell out of me. It starts with a father/son cliché and all this waffling on about being a man and standing up for what one believes in is so commonorgarden that I wondered whether Ridley Scott has seen any films besides his own. I mean, If you look at Gladiator and than take a look at this flick, you can only come to one conclusion: the plot is unimportant! It really does not matter where the film is set or what time it is exactly. As long as it is the ancient times and as long as we can be sure to include some battle scenes into the film, this flick could be anything. If you just take one battle scene and present it to an audience that hasn't seen the film and have them guess what kind of film this is, I bet they will hazard guesses such as: Lord of the Rings, Gladiator, El Cid, Ben Hur and so on. Generally, I don't like these movies because there is nothing in it I can relate to: Neither the subliminal chauvinism and ridiculous manhood that is being appraised in these films nor the fascination with battle scenes where the slaughtering of thousands of people is justified by implementing a hero like young and handsome Orlando Bloom who is portrayed as the wise leader who fights for a worthy cause where in fact he is nothing else than a puppet manipulated by the American Government in order to justify wars such as those in Vietnam, Iraq and elsewhere. It is a film that is trying to lure young American men into the army in order to turn them into cannon fodder. It's sick, sick, sick! There, I said it!",Kingdom of Heaven
214,markymark70,Average film....,6,25 March 2009,"I saw this film on DVD the other night and had great expectations for it. I know the reviews were not great but neither were they too damning - so I was hopeful I would see a real gem. Alas - it was not to be. I cannot say it was bad movie but neither can I saw it was a really good one either. The main problems with it were as follows: 1. Story. It was a bit muddled and at times a little hard to follow. Certain things happen during the film to maybe imagine that Balian (played by Orlando Bloom) just may be a little special. He survives a boat sinking, he turns arid land into fertile land, his horse suddenly appears to him when he is almost dead from exhaustion, he deflects swords in battle when he truly should have been killed. And as I watched this I was prepared to go along with the whole 'protected by God' element but in the end - there was nothing about it.2. Dialogue. The words the actors were asked to speak at every turn were preachy, prophetic, always full of meaning and wise. It was a little like reciting Shakespeare instead of true interaction with other people. I suppose the makers were trying to imbue a higher sense of gravitas into the film but it comes off a tad annoying after a while.3. Acting. I have not seen any of the Lord of the Rings films where Bloom first made his name so I cannot comment on his acting ability in those pictures. However - I did see him in Troy, and thought his performance was embarrassingly bad. Still, he has that kind of demeanour about him that you want to see him succeed - so I still had high hopes for him in this film. He was better than Troy but still way off what you require from a leading man. It seemed a deliberate ploy from the writer/director to have Bloom gazing somewhere just off camera but not say anything. His lines were very few and far between and maybe the rumours of Scott not wanting Bloom in the first place have some credence. Norton has an unplayable part but does his best with it. Irons and Neeson come out of it reasonably well also. Bloom though - for all his posturing and good-looks - just needs something else to elevate his career. I'm sure he will go on from this to be better and better but as things stand now - he needs to improve.There are enough good qualities in the film to push its rating to an average level - great cinematography, lush production values (nothing is cheap or skimpy here), good battle scenes.But in the end it could all have been far better and in my humble opinion would have been if the storyline had been more concentrated on Bloom's character only - letting the bigger Christian/Islam battle aside.",Kingdom of Heaven
215,Juni78ukr,Not great though watchable,6,7 May 2005,"As a fan of epic movies I liked Braveheart, Gladiator, Troy and liked even more hated by almost anyone Alexander so I supposed that I would like Kingdom of Heaven. I wanted to like it but unfortunately I couldn't. From very beginning of the movie something went wrong. As it happens very often the biggest problem of the movie is the poor script. It seems at parts unreal and illogical, sometimes even ridiculous, particularly the first part, that show Balian's road to Jerusalem. His miraculous transformation from an ordinary blacksmith into an excellent swordsman and the noblest knight in the entire world, and finally into a military genius is unconvincing. Almost the same with the dialogs. Most of them are not pretty wise or memorable and what is the worst I found they look too modern for XII century. Characters development is on the same level as all above mentioned. Most of the characters are sketchy and primitive, particularly the usual bad guys. Though the final confrontation in the movie is related with Arabians and Saladin they are not shown as villains and that is very good point to me). The true bad characters here are Templars, who are terribly pathetic and silly in the movie. The more complicated aspect of the story is that it pretends to carry lots of morale messages and difficult historical moments. From any point of view an attempt of showing a horrible cruelty of the Crusades deserves lots of credits. Adding moral values and peaceful messages also is pretty good point though at the same time the movie that use really existed characters should be more careful with historical accuracy. Unfortunately such positive elements were implanted into flawed main story. The second biggest problem of Kingdom of Heaven is Orlando Bloom. Well, he wasn't terribly bad there but this movie perfectly showed that he haven't got enough charisma to carry movie at his own. Although most of the other actors are reasonably well at their roles in the movie we can see couple of decent actors with very good performances. First of all it's Ghassan Massoud who is excellent as Saladin (pretty nice to see Arabian actors playing Arabs). For a some strange coincidence this character is more developed than others as well as his part include almost all really memorable phrases and dialogs in the movie. Edvard Norton's performance as leper King Baldwin is also very good while Jeremy Irons show his talents in one of supporting roles.Finally the important part of every epic movie - the battle scenes. Here's the third crucial problem and flaw. They are never exciting and terribly violent, more more closer to Kill Bill movies than any other epic movie. Even the final siege of Jerusalem which supposed to be at least memorable don't make any exception. After a couple of minutes it become dull and at times simply laughable. Just think about that: 200 thousands of soldiers with siege weapons against several thousands or even tens thousands of not trained people. I can accept and imagine lots of things but not such a battle. Sorry but this is not a fairy tale and Jerusalem is not Helm's Deep.So my impressions are mixed as they never been before. Worth seeing but definitely not a great movie with numerous positive and negative moments. My grade 6.4 out of 10",Kingdom of Heaven
216,jtpaladin,Hollywood's Crusade,1,30 October 2005,"According to IMDb, it states that KoH failed in the U.S. and Canada while being successful in countries where Islamic terrorists do their recruiting. Yes, Osama Bin Laden would be proud of Ridley Scott's Christophobic historically inaccurate piece of pro-Islam propaganda. I think there's good reason that Hollywood should not be rewarded for its' continuing efforts to portray Christians and Western activities as evil, barbaric, misguided, greedy, hypocritical, etc.Anyone notice that priests or any Christian leaders portrayed in Hollywood films and other media these days are shown in the worst possible light? Case in point, there was not one single Christian clergyman in KoH that was portrayed as honest, kind, or good. All clergymen in KoH were total degenerates. Of course, historically, we know that this is no more true than trying to paint Muslims as all evil murdering rapists. So why did Ridley Scott create a Christophobic atmosphere in KoH? Because Hollywood is not filled with people who give any value to the Christian faith and would rather expend energy spreading lies and absurdities about Christian clergymen than show them in a fair light.You get a sense that Scott was going to be exceptionally unkind to the Christian efforts to stop the Muslim onslaught that had by that time been going on for about 600 years. The title scroll refers to Jerusalem as having been ""seized"" by the Christians when in fact it was the Muslims who seized Jerusalem and the Christians liberated it. Jerusalem had been under Christian control for hundreds of years until the Muslims swept through the region, taking advantage of a weakened Byzantine Empire (who oddly enough, considering how important they were in the region, are not at all mentioned) who had spent hundreds of years defending Europe against any number of non-European tribes trying to sweep through Europe while pillaging and raping as they went along.Ridley Scott decided from the outset that Christians were to be portrayed as invaders and bad people and Muslims as liberators and good people. It was that simple.This film is another demonstration of Hollywood's obsession with playing fast and loose with the facts. The personal stories between the characters were of course pure fabrications. The film's suggestion that Saladin needed to be convinced to allow the people to leave the city unharmed is not true. Saladin offered to let the people go from the start, it was the defenders that wanted to fight on. Also, Saladin didn't let people leave for free as the film suggests. Everyone had to pay a ransom to get out alive, otherwise be sold into slavery.The portrayal of the Knights Templar was inaccurate. They were not the villains that Scott made them out to be. In the film, Guy de Lusignan is portrayed as a Knights Templar. He's even wearing the surcoat of one. Historically, he was not a Templar Knight. Again, Ridley Scott was playing with facts in order to make the Templars look evil when in fact they were not.I thought the costumes, sets, and special effects were very well done and historical, for the most part. The acting was relatively good and the actors well chosen for their roles.In summary, I don't really know why Scott chose this particular moment in history to play out his Crusade story. There were far more interesting periods of time that Scott could have chosen that would have served some kind of point. This period was neither the start of the Crusades nor the end nor the most interesting period of the Crusades. By the end of the film, you're asking yourself, ""So what?"" Scott missed out on a great opportunity to use his budget and skills to create a Crusade film that would have been much more interesting and factual.What was the point of this film other than to make Christians look like barbaric losers rather than the defenders of Europe from a vicious warring religion who is still to this day trying to overwhelm not only Christians but also the Jewish people with whom they once were allied against Christians? My recommendation is to simply watch this movie for the action and special effects and ignore trying to figure out what is truth and what is fiction. This is a film for guys since I haven't met any non-history oriented women that would even find any aspect of this film interesting.",Kingdom of Heaven
217,Akira-36,Not as good as Gladiator,7,12 May 2005,"Yet another fine movie spoiled by too much hype. The movie is far from controversial and not as well-made as The Gladiator. I get the feeling that the theatrical cut of Kingdom of Heaven may have suffered from rushed editing. There are at least three times when you can hear and see rough inter-cuts between scenes. The central character of this movie, Balian of Ibelin, does not evolve from a murderous blacksmith into a noble knight in a natural/reasonable progression. Perhaps it is due to poor scripting, poor direction or maybe Ridley Scott has actually traded solid character development, as we witnessed in Gladiator, with more time for colossal action sequences.The action sequences in this movie are probably the real star of the movie; they are well executed and exhilarating. However, they do not carry the same emotional weight as the killing sequences in Gladiator or the Battle of Hornburg in LOTR. This is largely due to little time is given for the audience to know and care about the characters in the movie. That leads to another let down: the movie offers us an array of interesting and powerful characters, who unfortunately gets killed too early.Liam Neeson, Edward Norton, David Thewlis and Ghassan Massoud each have strong screen presence. It is a pity that Orlando is much too young in his career to try to emulate and project the same kind of strength and charisma as these veterans.Kingdom of Heaven is undoubtedly one of the most well-made crusade film, however it doesn't hold its own weight for someone of Scott's caliber.",Kingdom of Heaven
218,pookey56,and the walls keep tumbling down,7,18 October 2005,"well, i cant really say whether Orlando could carry this film or not. to me his is still the enigmatic archer elfin prince legolas. one thing is certain, he's used to castle walls crashing down. in Kingdom he appears to be a compilation figure of he and his brothers, who are not mentioned at all. there is some historical accuracy here but not much. but i would venture to say that this is a better film than GLADIATOR, although the acting wasn't in the same league in Kingdom. i think GLADIATOR is Ridley Scott's poorest film, so naturally it won best picture. KINGDOM was scrambling and disjointed with huge gaps in the screenplay and story line. but some of the landscape shots were breath taking. the hand-to-hand battles were well choreographed and both sides were treated with a neutrality which was refreshing. i think of the middle east now...the more things change the more they stay the same. the character of Sibylla (there are variations in the spelling of her name) was actually an important royal whom several power-hungry lords wanted to marry, because no one expected her brother, the leper king Baldwin, who in reality was much younger than Ed Norton, to live for very long (and he didn't). and i enjoyed Eva Green's performance. she was regal and acted like she was. the very talented Jeremy Irons seemed like a throw-away character as Tiberius. they wasted his abilities completely and i didn't see any need for his being in this film. even so, this wasn't such a bad film. i have nothing but respect for Ridley Scott, who has put together a resume of great films, including Thelma and Louise and Black Hawk Down, where Orlando fell out of a helicopter early in the film. but i find myself wishing he would go back to his roots, to a time when he was making ground breaking, fabulous, atmospheric films based on challenging material, such as BLADE RUNNER and ALIEN. generally i find historically inaccurate films annoying, even if some of it is apocryphal, like Troy, and King Arthur. but it didn't much matter to me this time. not all of us are ardent fans of history or this time period, and Balliol, which wasn't even his true name, isn't exactly the most well-known historical figure. but he sure as hell didn't end his career telling Richard the Lion-Hearted that he was just a black smith. come on Mr. Scott. make us another brilliant sci-fi, would you?",Kingdom of Heaven
219,Steven Reynolds,Kingdom of Tedium,4,9 May 2005,"It looks like ""Gladiator"". It sounds like ""Gladiator"". It's directed by the guy who made ""Gladiator"". So why is it so dull? Blame a tedious, unmotivated story that wanders from one contrived scene to the next without any sense of order or purpose. As one friend put it, ""It's like watching the daily rushes from a movie that's still in production."" It's a damn shame because what the writer and director were clearly trying for here is something of a cinematic Trojan horse, not unlike ""Three Kings"": a message-movie disguised as an action-adventure. But ""Kingdom of Heaven"" ends up betraying both its genre and audience expectations. The trick with a Trojan horse movie is to make it ostensibly about something else, but this one fails because its radical intentions just aren't well enough disguised. Full credit to Ridley and crew for having a go, but with the exception of some marvellous CGI set pieces near the end and one or two good lines, the result is so miserably boring that all the effort is wasted and the message along with it. In the urge to push an agenda, they forgot to tell a story. Drama is about conflict, and you can't have that in a movie that simply refuses to pick a side. What does Orlando Bloom's Balian stand for? What does he want? What is he risking his life to achieve? He's nominally a Christian but seems essentially a liberal humanist, all too aware of the stupidity of fighting over a piece of ground that opposing religious traditions both imbue with spurious sanctity. He initially sets off to save his wife's soul from Hell, but then ditches all conviction when the chance to bed a fine wench comes along. In the end, he fights to save ""the people"", no matter what they happen to believe. Cut the soaring music and strip away William Monahan's fatuous phrasing and the knight's pledge pretty much comes down to, ""Can't we all just get along?"" A wonderful sentiment - and one the inhabitants of present-day Jerusalem would do well to heed - but a sword-and-sandals epic about the Crusades is hardly the place for it, not if you want the story to be engaging. If Ridley Scott wants to push liberal humanist ecumenism - and it certainly does need to be pushed - then his $130m budget might have been better spent on putting a copy of Tariq Ali's ""The Clash of Fundamentalisms"" into every American classroom. Now that would create some real drama.",Kingdom of Heaven
220,Baldrick44,"Good, but Bloom isn't quite a Crusader yet",8,11 May 2005,"Kingdom of Heaven is an epic movie, much in the same style as Gladiator. The story revolves around the time of the Crusades, where Jerusalem, now held by King Baldwin, is only kept under Christian control due to the diplomacy of he and Saladin, leader of the Muslim army that surrounds it. Into this setting comes Balian, a young blacksmith whose wife has just died and who himself soon into the movie kills the priest who desecrates her memory.He therefore journeys with his father, Godfery of Iberhim, to the promised land, where it is said that all sins are forgiven. They come to a city where Christians are divided- those who follow Baldwin and his vision of a 'Kingdom of Heaven' and those who follow the Knights Templar, believing that such a kingdom cannot exist with the Muslims in close proximity. This sets about a chain of events that will eventually see Ballian defending the walls of Jerusalem against Saladin's army.As a history student I saw a couple of historical flaws in this film but Scott pays much more attention to history than he ever did in Gladiator. As for the casting, Liam Neeson is fantastic as Godfery and I cannot wait to see him play Batman's mentor. Jeremy Irons is very good as the pragmatic Tiberias and David Thewlis makes a couple of memorable speeches as the Warrior-Priest Hospitaller. Edward Norton is also good as the leper King Baldwin. A special mention must go to Syrian star Ghassan Massoud who plays Saladin brilliantly.The only man who lets down the cast is Bloom himself, who really doesn't rouse the same passion as Russel Crowe did in Gladiator, or, ironically, Viggo Mortensen or Bernard Hill did in LOTR. As such I found myself waiting for the next scene with one of the supporting characters.Kingdom of Heaven is a good movie and while Bloom is a little iffy, the rest of the cast shines to make it worth seeing.",Kingdom of Heaven

Well, I am not going to do that.Firstly, who told you all the historical records were accurate? Can you prove it? This is the same case as the bible which has been continuously revise to suit the purpose of the Church.Secondly, who told you Guy was a templar? In no scene in the movie were you ever told he was one. He might think himself as one, but being a noble, he is probably not.Thirdly, I think Ridley Scott is trying to address the discrimination issues that goes back down the centuries between the Europeans and the Middle-easterns (no, not Christianity and Islam). This probably infuriate many religiously-bonded people, whomever they may be and of what faith.I think he did a great job at showing you how wars are started. Often by those who whispers into the ears of the power-wielders.

222,Targe,An ambitious film by a good director that somehow falls short,7,13 September 2010,"I can't figure it out with this movie. I would normally LOVE anything involving knights, castles, swords, fighting, battles, Liam Neeson. The only thing I can put my finger on is the glaring plot holes and ridiculous story line.First, disregarding the strange murder of a priest who decides to get the main character's goat for some strange reason, we have an opening battle that kills off two of the best main characters in the movie and mortally wounds a third! We have a local guard who thinks it's worth their while to take on seasoned crusaders to capture a murderer? Rather implausible.Then they kill off Liam Neeson, right away. One of the best things going for this movie, they kill him off. Really stupid mistake there.Then the main character get's on a boat, get's into a ridiculous storm you would never see in the Mediterrannean (why would they sail then?) more at home in The Perfect Storm movie, and the guy mysteriously floats to shore in a piece of the ship, with intact horses that are tied up in cages also mysteriously surviving!!! Who wrote this??? So then he runs into some top right hand man of Saladin, but the guy dresses down so his servant looks like him??? And suddenly our blacksmith is deadly with the sword? After a couple lessons in the woods with the crusaders? Where his mysterious sword skills came from is never explained.Then we have him lecturing us on about his knightly honour, blah blah blah, and he screws some other knight's wife at the first opportunity. WTF??? Oh yeah, that is REAL noble of ya mr. knight! Then he refuses to let the total maniac a-hole husband be executed, even though they are pretty sure the guy was involved in a war crime against a Muslim village. Again... WTF. It's pretty much all I say in this movie. WTF WTF WTF.So what happens is you end up HATING this Orlando Bloom main character dude, strutting around with his sanctimonious drivel, shagging other guy's wives, refusing to exact justice on a-holes, and then surrendering the entire city after fighting for days.I still gave this movie a 7, for the awesome scenery, castles, costumes, battle scenes, but the story SUCKS, big time, and it's so full of implausible holes it sinks like the main character should have, in that freak-god-storm.",Kingdom of Heaven
223,KingCoody,"Blood ,Thunder,and a Director's Cut",7,9 May 2005,"On one of the cable news segments a reviewer for Newsweek? called this a P.C. epic since it had everybody more or less in a good 21st century humanist light. Well, epic movies have reflected the times and politics of the directors and audience: They Died With Their Boots On saw WWii and the early defeats in the Pacific rushing toward them,the second Charge of the Light Brigade dwelt on the utter waste of battle conducted by class bound military idiots, while the Rambo - Missing in Action films proclaimed the mantra if only the 'Nam troopers had been fully unleashed. If you want to compare Kingdom of Heaven to a film set during the Crusades, watch if you can Cecil deMille's The Crusades. Can you say ""we've come a long way baby?"" KOH has a good start then slows as the Hero settles into his new role as lord of the manor with a diverse peasantry of Jews, Moslems and both native born and foreign Christians. Then there is a too similar scene with Gladiator a Dying Noble King offering the throne to our Hero with the caveat that blood must be spilled in attaining the prize. But I'm a sucker for a well staged medieval battle scene especially if it captures the mindnumbing slaughter it entailed to actually feel the blood spurt and bone crunch of ones immediate foe,the melee in the breach is perfect. Read Stephen Runciman's histories for a true picture of events,or, for fun,read Harold Lamb's romanticized pulp history version, there are times when you half expect Conan or Kull to stride through.",Kingdom of Heaven
224,RobinCook70,Drifting thru the Kingdom of Heaven,5,13 May 2005,"Considering how so many comments have been made about the story, my comments here are directed mostly at the meandering them of this movie. I would like to watch it again perhaps when it comes out on DVD so that I can get up and and stretch a bit or rewind to catch up on spots where my brain drifted away. I find that when my mind drifts a lot in a movie, the acting or the characters or the script lacks. Continuity lacks. I was captured with great interest until Neeson died, and then I felt I was loping thru a dusty trail of afterthoughts. I felt more realism could have been put forth insofar as the customs and cultures of the various communities/faiths of other characters portrayed, which would have given more detail and interest to the viewer, plus provided more meaningful perspective. One example is the lopping off of Orlando's wife's head after suicide. And, the removal of the veil in front of a horde of men to get a cup of water made my eyes roll. This veiled beauty seemed to have no attraction cohesiveness with Orlando ... another spot my brain drifted as she flirted and I detected no juice.I agree, the movie was rather long, which added to further drifting. This drifting caused me to miss some key parts (I think), but by the time the movie was over I didn't much care. At least with the DVD, I can pause it when I drift. The movie does have good parts and one that I found significant with actual realism and feeling was Orlando's standing and subsequently sitting atop the rock where Jesus was crucified. Looking at the view of what Jesus viewed touched me. Another was the leprosy. I felt this scene with the masked man to have been more rushed than I would have liked, or perhaps it was the timing of script context that was out of sync to exact the in-depth meaning of what was being said for the viewer. Perhaps I drifted somewhere else regarding some ""meaning"" to the separation of Orlando from his family and how he ended up being a blacksmith .. and it was unclear to me if he was a slave, servant or what his status was in the village. Due to this I didn't feel there was really any family bonding to give more foundation to Orlando being accepted so readily after Neeson died. Many scenes were done too hastily in my opinion, lacked detail, and others dragged on way too long. Hence, my vote is in the middle of the fence on this one where I refer to it as a hit and miss brain drifting experience type movie. Perhaps there was too much detail in this movie for my brain to process, which happens to me sometimes. I agree with another comment for this movie to be required study in schools, but for the historic and culture(s)content, not for drama or theater courses.Orlando's character in this movie had no spunk after Neeson left the screen. I couldn't find him believable and felt his acting most times to be forced or plainly apathetic. It probably wasn't his fault, but perhaps the scriptwriter or director, I don't know. I felt many times in the movie that the locations of scenes were more interesting to me than the movie, so that kept me entertained. So, it boils down to my brain drifting quite a bit and I may give this movie a better vote after I've seen it again on DVD ... that is, if I can get past my initial impression at this time. So, my vote is five stars for now.",Kingdom of Heaven

History is fact and though they try to make u think it's different they can't change it. But as far as a MOVIE experience this one ranks as one of my favorite movies for its Cinematography, Costumes, Acting, Action, and overall Realism (not history). I loved it and continue to watch it over and over, the cast is awesome and despite mixed reviews of Bloom I admit I have a little man crush on him so I tend to overlook the bad ones.

True. Bloom's characterization of Balian is rather monochromatic, but it is no more one-dimensional than Crowe's ""gladiator."" That said, the creative team on this Ridley Scott entry has, again to me at least, equalled the high standards of ""The Duellist""? I think that was a Ridley Scott achievement. And on this go, there is the added timeliness, the parallel paradigms of a humanity at odds and civilization at a crossroads. ""In the Valley of Elah"" broaches the contexts of brutality and violence in re the individual capacity to deal with same.

230,maxmik,Orlando pulls it off,10,14 May 2005,Although he comes from the Keannu Reeves school of acting Orlando Bloom manages to carry this film with no problem. He looks good and even though in his one big scene he sounds British (he plays a French blacksmith) that's OK. Eva Green is hot too - is this only her second movie - after Bertolucci's THE DREAMERS. Wow she's going to have a great career. The rest of the cast is uniformly great with Edward Norton as the leper king a standout. Also that Syrian actor as the Numero Uno Muslim. OK the Crusaders are the bad guys and the Muslims are the good guys. There's plenty of history to go around with who's invading who right up to the present day. There is surprising little exploration of religion in this flick. But what it does have in spades is HORSES! Big beautiful gorgeous Arabian horses. Anyone who loves horses has to see this movie.,Kingdom of Heaven
231,amraampk,"nice brilliant , Little flawed but another epic",9,21 December 2009,"Kingdom of heaven revolves around the times when Jerusalem had become a hub for 3 faiths who forever believe it as sacred place their religion's origin. Talking about crusades , they happened in 1096 when pope of Rome urged Christian nations to rise up against Muslim control of Jerusalem as it will be very great service to Christianity and will also ensure the survival of their religion. In those times Europe was in grip of illiteracy, prejudice, lawlessness and injustice. It was a great opportunity for every one who had lived life sinfully and unsatisfactory. The crusades last till 1173 ,till this city was 1st remained in the hand of Muslims then Christians took over then again Muslims regained it. When European Christian armies took control they not only slaughtered Muslim population but they burned and destroyed the synagogues and properties of Jews also. It always happened in that city where one religious group in power persecuted others and it still happening out there. If this film is concerned i think it draws quite much closer to history. The Muslim leader Sallah-ud-din Ayubi is portrayed in a quite honest style. Muslims were not barbaric and evil as west considers. Even if they were , if are today then is not the fault of their religion. Sallah din was kind of person whom quite western historians gave a positive and nice opinion. King Rchards of England and Frederick Barbarosa of France were his most tough rivals in Battle field , even perhaps they also had developed some respect for him. In this film his character is played very good by a middle eastern. The man in this film leading was Orlndo Bloom who some how has desire or reputation of working in epic movies.He has always done well in just one category as mentioned above. The young man is fantastic. Liam neesson played Godfrey who was a leading commander in the crusader army and he was illegitimate father of Bilian(Orlando) who came back for his son t Europe than his son after difficultly forgiving him later joined in. If we look at history even after a long time Christian world lost but it also become very essential for them , from here they understood their shortcomings weaknesses and ignorance, because in those times Muslim world was better in therms of economics, science & technology, organizational structures and social development. Europe changed it very much and adapted all the better and noble ways of life Muslims had in those times while Muslims on the other hand adapted all the evils of western world and given up their contribution in science , economics , industrialization etc, They headed towards illiteracy, prejudice, extremism and sectarianism ,and are still going on. That s why Muslim world is having problems today to exist with the entire world. It was once said about Muslims and Islam by George Bernard Shaw as"" Islam on one side is the best religion while Muslims on the other side are the worst followers"". Some Muslims like me fully endorse it. To G.B.Shaw Islam and Muslims had become 2 different things. Now if the movie is concerned i really enjoyed the acting, dramatization , production and direction. This film is another master piece of Ridelly scott he and his brother Tony are both great directors. I believe this film can some how little bit but remove some misconception and misunderstandings among religions.",Kingdom of Heaven
232,MosHr,"Orlando Bloom (Legolas) plays Aragon decries Christianity; But, the Muslims don't plays orcs",8,16 October 2005,"Despite the movie being about Jerusalem, it only uses the Christian-Muslim feud as a backdrop. So, it's really a run-of-the-mill high-budget epic about a nobody that rises to the pinnacle of glory. Which is a big big relief. I was dreading that this was going to be more about mass Muslim body count kind of thing but it thankfully wasn't.The aesthetics for the battle come right out of Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. Here, Bloom plays what Aragon plays in defending Helms Deep; he has the dark hair, the beard and the breach in the wall defending Jerusalem.However, what is most shocking is the almost renunciation of Christianity. We start off with a religiously trepid hero who fears that his loved wife is in hell because of her suicide, and Jerusalem is where redemption lies. The movie ends with a bold ""you've taught me a lot about religion"" said at a supercilious and cowardly priest symbolizing the presented hollowness of religion. The crusading templars in the name of Christianity are the main villains in the movie; the Muslims are wise and sagacious while the crusaders lead the army to annihilation on a perceived faith that Christ's army could not be defeated.On Bailin's dismay that God does not speak to him, a lengthly speech on deeds that make a man not a the God ensues.

233,pandabat,Disappointing and lacking substance,4,9 May 2005,"Let's start with the good points. The movie looks good and the acting, with the exception of Orlando Bloom, is of a high standard. In fact, it's not that Orlando is incredibly bad, it's just that his performance doesn't carry enough weight to pull the whole thing off effectively. His body should be carrying enough weight though, as I'd read that he'd actually put some on for this role. The one shot where this is apparent actually makes it look like his head has been stuck on top of someone else's body - ridiculous! Now, for the rest. Godfrey's ragtag, international band of men is cliché after cliché. There's the axe-wielding German, the priestly English knight, the token black guy. It's all a bit twee. They do have an excellent fight scene, which alas turns out to be the best in the movie.Eva Green looks good as Sibylla but due to her introduction, it's hard to think of her character as anything other than a bit of a slut. There's little intensity in the relationship between herself and Balian. In fact, her character's practically pointless! Considering what they went through, the Arabs seem to have very docile and understanding. Perhaps this is some attempt at bridge building in the modern era by the director but in the movie, it seems silly. The final shot of Saladin treating the a golden, holy cross with much respect seems unlikely.One of the main battles of the era, where the large part of the crusading forces are destroyed is completely skipped which left me cheated. As the human drama in this movie was unconvincing, it fell to the action to deliver and it failed on this count. Later battle scenes were very reminiscent of those from the Lord of the Rings trilogy but without the compelling drama of same.The story just crawls along and by the end I was glad to leave. The parting shots of the movie were pathetic attempts to weave another layer of emotion on top of what had gone before. Seeing as what had gone before had no real emotion, there were no foundations to build this upon, and like the Christians in Jerusalem, it was a failure!",Kingdom of Heaven
234,czarnobog,Another Topnotch Film by Ridley Scott,10,30 July 2006,"Despite being totally bowled over by Scott's ""BLACK HAWK DOWN"" and suspecting that this would be just as enjoyable, I was put off by the trailers for the theatrical release in the U.S. because I was afraid this film was going to be a jingoistic glamorization of the Christian Crusades.Sure enough, I was wrong. And I'm angry that I let myself be screwed out of what would have been an amazing big screen experience. This film delivers so much more production value than I expected from the trailers, as well as a super story and great characters.The sub-themes of the screenplay are honor and integrity, but its main musings are on the issues still haunting the Middle East today. Writer William Monahan deserves the credit for weaving such an intelligent tapestry of action and ideas. And Ridley Scott is to be commended for recognizing Monahan's great work and executing it brilliantly. It is easy to imagine how this would have gone in the hands of most directors. Who would have meddled with the script for the sake of adding another ""co-writing"" credit to their resume.While many of his peers have gotten dull and lost their edge, Scott has remained one of the very best filmmakers in the world. His directing is as crisp as ever, and his choice of material is outstanding. Unlike other reviewers here, I found the casting flawless and the film itself more satisfying than ""Gladiator.""I, for one, will never again doubt Scott's work based on trailers, reviews, or opinions, public or private. I can't wait to see what he cooks up next. I'll be there front row center next time.Bravo!",Kingdom of Heaven

Along the way, he realises that the city is a relatively peaceful place, but it is an unstable peace.Even though there have been a lot of historical epics coming out recently ('King Arthur', 'Alexander' etc.) and it seemed that studios were more concerned about cashing in on the 'Gladiator' trend as quickly as possible than actually releasing great films, I still decided to watch this film, mainly because Ridley Scott is director. Well, I must say, despite the generally downbeat reviews from critics, I actually really liked it. Although I didn't think all that much of Orlando Bloom's performance (he's a decent actor, but doesn't have the screen presence to carry a film like this), I was impressed by the rest of the cast, such as Liam Neeson, Edward Norton and Eva Green, even though her role was part of a treacly romantic subplot. Ridley Scott's direction is predictably sublime, and I might even say that his work here is on a par with 'Gladiator'.

Orlando Bloom actually manages to do a pretty good job this time around and there are plenty of other good actors such as Jeremy Irons and Liam Neeson. The plot and duologue are both pretty decent and give the movie a nice backdrop. The big difference from most other epics is that this one moves at a relatively fast pace and clocks in at around 135 minutes (thats what I measured). The costumes and sets are pretty impressive and the setting fits well. The CGI used is excellent and Ridley Scott really knows where to do what. The battle scenes are mostly on the positive side of things. The armies really do look epic and the visuals are excellent. The only problem is that when it gets to the 'heat of the battle', we get the usual blood gushing, swords flying, nothing can be understood types of scenes. The cinematography is very Ridley Scott'ish but at times the constant zooming does get on your nerves. The soundtrack by Harry Gregson Williams is also quite impressive though at times it really reminds of Gladiator and Black Hawk Down. Overall a pretty good film",Kingdom of Heaven
242,zevt,Good and bad,4,6 December 2018,"The good:The first hour promises a superbly crafted and written epic historical movie with dense, intelligent dialog and characters. This hour involves the set-up: An idealistic-minded blacksmith in mourning for his wife and child, finds himself en route to Jerusalem along with a newly discovered father. It's only after this hour that things fall apart.His traitorous fanatically Christian brother provides the religious catapult for the rest of the movie that involves Holy Land politics, crusades and battles.The sets and costumes look great (to this historically untrained eye at least). And the couple of battle scenes are epic in scale as only Ridley Scott can create.The bad:For starters, Orlando Bloom is passable, but pretty flat as the protagonist. Eva Green is an intense superb actress, but her character is way too modern and liberated for this movie.As soon as we get to Jerusalem, all of a sudden it becomes a preachy liberal movie with modern idealistic sensibilities, bias, re-interpretation of history and anachronisms galore. There are no really devout Christians, only hypocritical fanatics, Jews are practically nowhere to be seen, and the Arabs are noble, honorable and tolerant people.There are also some insulting plot developments that try to convince us that Balian the liberal is an idealistic leader. The village he moves into is dry for hundreds of years, and as soon as he arrives they dig and find a well. Evidently, Arabs living in this land had no idea how to dig a well until a European came along. Same goes for his basic and obvious advice to seasoned war veterans about soldiers needing water.Regarding the people: Even if you were to argue that there was a period where the religions lived together in Jerusalem, it would hardly be the tolerant utopia this movie would have you believe. There would be outbreaks of attacks and intolerance, second-class citizens and treatments, and so on. We know this from thousands of years of history in many countries.A quick look at the actual historical events in this movie reveals a completely different story than this liberal fantasy movie: Balian initially promised to Saladin never to fight him. Christians had to absolve him of his oath to protect Jerusalem because they decided Christianity is more important than an oath to a non-Christian. Before Saladin took Jerusalem he offered peaceful terms of surrender and they refused. It's only after the siege started that he refused terms. Balian then threatened to kill all Muslims in the city and destroy Muslim holy sites if he didn't offer them quarter. And then they had to pay ransom as part of their surrender, and many of the people were enslaved.So not only does history blatantly contradict the events in this movie, it depicts very different people, leaders and motivations and the liberalism this movie fantasizes about is nowhere to be seen.But even as a non-historical fantasy, this movie simply makes no sense. The real fatal problem of this movie is that this movie has agnostics, liberals, atheists and religious people that only pay lip-service to religion, all fighting religious wars with no apparent motivation. Why would a tolerant leader defend a city in a hopeless war against another tolerant leader, if he explicitly states that all he cares about is the people? If that's the case, give up the city and negotiate a peace! In this movie, we have two completely religiously unmotivated but noble and honorable leaders waging battle over a meaningless city without even trying to negotiate before it starts. And then only after they are done dying by the thousands, they simply surrender with the most honorable terms possible when they could have simply done this to begin with. The actual historical version of this story makes a lot more sense in terms of motivations, whereas this fantasy doesn't even begin to make sense.In summary, the liberal agenda in this movie is so desperate to re-interpret history with its bias, it fails to see that the people and story make no sense as soon as this is done. Therefore it fails both as a history lesson and as a fantasy movie.",Kingdom of Heaven
243,Rick-34,I fell asleep!,5,16 May 2005,"OK, I was feeling a bit jet lagged, but somehow this film could not hold my attention. I blame Orlando Bloom. There are many fine actors in this film: Liam Neeson, Jeremy Irons, and Edward Norton (though hardly recognizable), among others. Unfortunately, the lead actor isn't quite up to snuff. I never felt that I understood his motivations at all. I kept thinking things like ""wow, this blacksmith has an incredible grasp of siege warfare"" or ""imagine that: a French blacksmith fluent in Arabic!"" So, that was part of the problem. My other problem is that this film seemed to fall into the trap of imposing modern sensibilities onto medieval characters. At one point, Bloom's character launches into a speech saying essentially that none of the religions have all the answers. A bishop notes that this is blasphemy, but Bloom's viewpoint seems to carry the day.In a more realistic movie, the bishop would have been listened to. And would not have appeared like such a clown. (And I say this as a non-believer.) Historical movies are rarely done well, as most of them simply transplant modern sensibilities into some remote world. (""Troy"" is a good example of this problem: in the real Iliad, the gods played active major roles.) Better historical fiction uses not only the places, characters, and events of the past, but also reconstructs the mindset of the time. ""The Name of the Rose"" comes to mind as such a movie.",Kingdom of Heaven

In Kingdom of Heaven, Orlando Bloom plays a french blacksmith with an English accent who after a brief and interrupted sword training session, is apparently equipped for knighthood and leading the defense of a city under siege from the forces of Saladin. Now, if you can swallow that, you shouldn't have any real problems with KoH, however, if that statement made you shudder, please avoid imbibing this movie.Script aside, It certainly looks impressive, bringing that epic feel we've come to expect from a Ridley Scott flick. With impressive costumes and sets bringing to life the middle ages, the only thing really ignored were the people IN the costumes, living IN the Middle Ages. Characters are thrown on screen with little more introduction than, I'm sneering I must be Bad! This is a quick and easy way to point out the villains to us.I had similar issues with Gladiator, why can't characters in these period pieces just BE the regular Joe? Gladiator can't JUST be a gladiator, he has to be a deposed Roman general with vengeance on his mind, because a guy that does bloodsport for a living just wouldn't be interesting enough. So here with Bloom's Jack-of-all trades blacksmith, who inexplicably knows desert irrigation, military tactics, and oratory while wooing a queen and looking pretty.

After that he directed a lot of mediocre stuff, before turning to history. Gladiator was nothing else but a remake of ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"". Only just cardboard characters this time. Awful!And now, ""Kingdom of Heaven"". What a horrible piece of Hollywood making jokes at history. I'm from Europe, sorry, we really care about history.The templars were fanatics, but an integrated part of the Christian kingdoms in Palestine.

Hey guys, make SF movies, there you can do whatever you want. But please, Hollywood, leave your hands off the past.

In the main battle they use something like Greek fire, roughly 200 years before it was invented. The catapults were build on medieval European plans. Definitely non Islamic! In the first conflict we see longbows. There were no longbows at that time! And this is just a small list.Not even the basic stuff is accurate!Does the story itself save the film? No it doesn't. 2 dimensional characters, stereotypes, do not make a big movie. The story is plain and predictable.The one thing scott stands for is the camera work. OK, that's well done.

This is made all the more difficult when the director skews the history to serve his purposes. I don't write that disparaging any perceived ""liberal"" bias as one with tremendous respect for Scott, but he misuses the past so egregiously to fit in a incoherent plot full of such coincidences and examples of 'deus ex machina' that one can only throw up one's hands. With nearly 400 reviews, it seems presumptuous to add one more, but some immediate issues: I bought the 2-disk 'director's cut,' complete with overture before the film starts with France literally in darkness. I understand the orthodox view of the ""Dark Ages"", but it was ridiculous. Battle scenes, as is typical of Scott films, are difficult to make out and sacrifice realism (knights rushing in with drawn swords against lances) for stop-jerk action. Balian's meeting of his father is given no explanation, and the entire time between them resolves neither the maddeningly unclear background or the vague notions of rank and the duty required. His journey to Jerusalem where his ship is run aground by a storm leaving him and a horse the sole survivors is a cop-out. As is the fact everyone can understand his specific French dialect no matter who he encounters or on which part of the earth's surface. To see a mere, common blacksmith telling King Baldwin IV of Jerusalem the problem with its fortifications, coming up with the (up to that point of time in history) novel idea of a 'star' system of fortifications. The land he takes from his educated, world-weary father he manages to immediately improve, coming up with more ideas no-one else in the whole of the planet thought up. And throughout we hear of Jerusalem being ""a kingdom of conscience"" without any sense of understanding what made people from throughout Europe come to die through their beliefs.

249,nived84,The Director's Cut - A serious epic from a serious filmmaker,9,28 May 2006,"This is my review of the Director's Cut for Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven, which has now been released on a four disc DVD. The Director's Cut is three hours and fourteen minutes long; almost fifty minutes longer than the original theatrical cut that was released over a year ago. This new version, which Scott has said is his preferred cut of the film is Unrated, and does contain a little more sex (no nudity, in case you're wondering) and blood and gore than the original cut. This version contains a number of new scenes that further explain and flesh out the main characters of Balian (Orlando Bloom) and Sibylla (Eva Green), including Sibylla's son, which was completely cut from the theatrical version.The film is about a blacksmith named Balian, played well by Orlando Bloom is the exact opposite of what he played in Troy. Balian is contacted by his distant father and the Baron of Ibelin, named Godfey (Liam Neeson), a knight whose been fighting in the crusades. He visits Balian in hopes of him joining him back to Jerusalem. Balian decides to join him in hopes of being able to erase his wife's sins, because she killed herself after losing her child during birth. During their journey Godfey is severely wounded during a battle and he knights his son to take his place when is gone. Once he arrives in Jerusalem he meets King Baldwin, played well by a disguised Edward Norton, the King suffers from leprosy and wears a silver mask to hide what his face has become. The King takes to Balian, and asks for his loyalty, which he offers, and then returns to his father's home in Ibelin to make it his own. That is when he falls in love with Sibylla, the wife of Guy de Lusignan (played by Marton Csokas), an evil man who uses his religion and the name of God to justify the massacring of Muslims to quench his own personal bloodlust. Guy's unapproved attacks start a whirlwind of violence between Christians and Muslisms, drawing Saladin, a Muslism King with a vast and powerful army towards the city of Jerusalem to try and reclaim it from the Christians. That's basically the plot of Kingdom of Heaven in a nutshell.The theatrical version plays out more like an action film; quickly hurrying through the personal human drama to get to the big action set pieces. This cut plays out more like a serious human/moral drama, set amidst an epic landscape with some amazing sets and visuals, and the added depth to the characters really does help you get more into the human aspect of the film, rather than just waiting to get to the next big action sequence. You'll get so into the political/religious/moral/ethical dilemma that by the time you get to the final battle you'll almost be disappointed, almost, but not quite, because the ending siege of Jerusalem is quite a spectacle all its own. I was actually quite surprised how much more interesting this version was, given the fact that it was fifty minutes longer and there's really not that much more action in it than what was already released. But the character development is far better and heavily improved in this cut, which allows you to really get wrapped up in the plot.Is Orlando's performance better? Well yeah, it kind of is in a way, but mostly because you seem to understand his character a little better in this version and you can sympathize with him a lot more. And some of Eva Green's best moments in this film were the ones that ended up on the cutting room floor. If this version had been released in the theaters last year she might have been up for an Oscar nomination, but that's just my opinion. The Director's Cut is 194 minutes long and it's not an action/revenge film like Scott's previous period epic; Gladiator. Instead Kingdom of Heaven is a serious dramatic epic with a strong message about religion and war and what it really means to be righteous.There are many parallels between Kingdom of Heaven and Gladiator. Both films have lead characters that have suffered a personal loss in their family, and are both in love with a woman who seems to be very close to the enemy and both female characters have an only child whose life is very much in danger. But what really separates Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven into two separate identities is the fact that in the end Maximus exacts his revenge; killing his enemy, and Balian shows compassion and mercy to his enemy; knowing that doing the right thing may not be the easiest thing to do, but it is the right thing, and that's all that matters. I think this version of Kingdom of Heaven ranks up there with some of Ridley Scott's best work, including Alien, Gladiator and Black Hawk Down. But its not exactly the grand action sequences that make Kingdom of Heaven a memorable film; it's the constant focus on story, human dilemma, moral and ethical decisions that make it a fascinating and ultimately entertaining and satisfying film. This is a gorgeous looking epic with substance and intelligence and this is the film that Ridley Scott intended it to be from the start. Forget about Troy, King Arthur and Alexander. This is a real epic. Thumbs way up.",Kingdom of Heaven
250,aernest,"Surprisingly, I like it",8,3 July 2009,"As a teacher, I have become used to the liberties Hollywood takes with literature and history, so I was prepared to hate this movie. I'm not a huge Orlando Bloom fan either, so that was an issue. I am a fan of Ridley Scott, though, so I gave it a shot. Surprisingly, I liked it. Scott takes liberties with history, too, but not as many as I thought he would. The Christians and Muslims are not stereotyped - there are good and bad on each side. It is the story of one man's finding an uneasy salvation in the midst of the sweep of history. It has become my favorite Crusades movie, and I think Bloom delivers his best performance ever. Extra added goodness comes in the forms of Liam Neeson and the always fun Jeremy Irons .I like that the movie really does not seem to come down on one side or the other of the issue. True to Scott, the movie is beautiful and the score is lovely as well.",Kingdom of Heaven
251,sweetrupturedlight,"Conflicting, but i was won over",8,21 May 2005,"Kingdom of Heaven is a movie, much like King Arthur, that needs to be viewed more than once and preferably the Directors Cut when you see it for the second time, for there is much left unexplained, even after 2.5 hours.There is no doubt that the movie is a visual feast. It is beautiful to watch and i marvelled at the skill and mastery of Ridley Scott. This movie, although tagged and advertised as the next Gladiator is not that, i don't think that there can ever be, but there is something here that i found infinitely intriguing. Something that captivated me, even when in the back of my mind many unfolding scenes seemed to leave me unsatisfied.The movie begins with the funeral of a woman we learn is Balian's (Orlando Bloom) wife. We learn that her suicide after the death of their child is what has driven our soon-to-be hero to the depths of depression as he has committed himself to spend his days repenting for her sin. Enter the father he never knew Godfrey (Liam Neeson) and the story begins. The entry of this character already sets the scene for the Directors Cut. We know too little about Godfrey, his importance to the King, his role within the struggle at the time, his lack of involvement with Balian, and his sudden return to recruit his son - all which is never really answered and explored, leaving a crucial hole in the story. Circumstances arise and after initial refusal, Balian joins his father on the journey to Jerusalem.From here the story escalates as Godfrey dies and Balian is left to take up the mantle his father left behind. I never understood his ready acceptance thereof. This is not really explored. We then enter the realm of the royalty. We are introduced to the other players. Jeremy Irons, a strong performance, but again poor character development. He later disappears altogether. The Princess of Jerusalem, Sybilla, another character poorly developed. I never understood her role, her instant love for Balian, and the choices she later makes, by handing her husband the crown, then repenting for something that we all knew was a mistake from the very beginning. Eva Green struck me as really beautiful as the Princess, but with so little a role in terms of character development, i was left unfulfilled by her purpose in the movie.We follow Balian as fate takes him to his ultimate destiny - fighting for the people. Orlando Bloom surpassed my expectations in the role, shouldering his first real leading role. He always struck me as an actor with very little meat. A pretty face who happened to be cast in movies that made his name even bigger, without really proving what he is capable of. He surprised me here. I thought that he was really good as the withdrawn, somewhat apart, the loner character that Balian comes across as. i was drawn in my his quiet nature and strong dialogue. There was something about him that to me shouted a newfound maturity as an actor. Although a far cry from being at the peak of his game, this is his strongest performance to date. I glimpsed some of the shifty eye-movements that Bloom is famous for (especially in Troy) but they were easily overlooked. I think that at times his character did lack a little emotion - his relationship with Sybilla for example didn't really move him from his quest - but this i think was more the Director and Writers problem, not Orlando's. Overall i was impressed. After having read numerous reviews that he was the weakest link in the movie, i was surprised that i disagreed. No Russell Crowe or Viggo Mortensen rousing the armies to battle, but he gave it a great try.I found the demise of Guy an anti-climax as well. Besides the final humiliating ride on a horse, we never really delve into his demise, and never have the satisfaction of seeing him get what he deserved.I also think that the underlying message involving the Muslim/Christian battle speaks very eloquently to our times, and was dealt with in a tasteful manner that was not overkill to the viewer, keeping it as light as the movies ultimate message would allow.However, overall, i felt this movie didn't flow very well. There seemed to be a shifty feel, not a nice smooth pace maintained to the conclusion. The movie itself will be better viewed with the Directors Cut, perhaps allowing for all the developments that there was no time for.Having said so much about how much i disliked, i still left the cinema intrigued by the story and the characters. I liked the movie, despite all the reservations. The cinematography was brilliant and i was really drawn in by good performances from Bloom and the supporting cast.I think that this is one movie you will have to make up your own mind about. Reviews are all conflicting and range from outright hate to devotion. I think there is something for you here, you just have to find it. Its worth a watch.7/10",Kingdom of Heaven

I did not bother to look, but its probably somebody known considering how much ass kissing this movie got.Movie has two-three decently choreographed fight scenes. That is offset by having Orlando Bloom as main character. Having his character turn down to be king kills rest of what this could have been.",Kingdom of Heaven
253,mhajs,Watch Gladiator instead.,6,1 November 2005,"**1/2 out of **** I could easily rate even lower this movie. Sincerely, Kingdom Of Heaven is not, by any means, the follow-up that Gladiator deserved. That movie was a true masterpiece, and it seems that other epic movies are great also, but none of them matches what's Gladiator. In Ridley Scott's newer epic movie, Orlando Bloom stars as the leading character, the hero Balian, the new baron of Ibelin. What moves this movie is his quest to reach the holy lands, Jerusalem and there find forgiveness for his sins, those of his wife and also (there had to come to that, obviously) to protect the people of that place by fighting their enemies.The movie takes place in the 12th century France. There is raging a war between christians and muslims, historical fact which defines how Kingdom Of Heaven should be. First, to begin this review, I must say that watching it for the second time made me feel a little better, but not completely. The movie is very well made, shot, produced and directed. It may be nominated for a very good couple of academy awards. But the low points of the movie seem to be the very same of those of Ridley Scott's 1992's 1492 : Conquest Of Paradise, starring Gerard Depardieu, where he plays Christopher Columbus, in a quest to discover for the first time the American lands. Scott shows for most of the time, fights between the two opposite sides, forgetting that sometimes he must center some attention in the characters of the movie.Gladiator showed many different scenes. It began with the last of the fights of a war, continued shooting fighting scenes on a coliseum and centered its attention on Maximus, the guy who Russel Crowe plays. We know that Maximus' main objective is to avenge his wife and son, but also there's the story centered on Lucius, Commodus, Proximo, all characters have a goal in the movie. We learn about each of them and the movie becomes much more interesting. That leads to the viewers of the movie to cheer for Maximus and pray that Commodus gets a very deserved death.In Kingdom Of Heaven, the characters disappear like a flash of light. Tiberias (Jeremy Irons) says he'll be headed to a different direction than of Balian's. Sibylla (most pretty girl Eva Green) is kicked in the butt by Balian when she tries to make it up with him when he says that a soul of a man cannot be sold. And it's a little confusing to know what actually happens to Guy (Marton Csokas). Is that his head next to Reynald's (Brendan Glessom) after Saladin (Ghassan Massoud) slashes his throat? Green keeps staring at Balian most of the time through a window room, completely speechless of anything. At least Connie Nielsen in Gladiator has a much better role, as she is one of Commodus victims.I hate movies with those low points, but since I love Ridely Scott, I shall be a little fair with him. I guess that his best qualities, tough, as a director lies in development of other movies like Alien, Blade Runner and Gladiator.",Kingdom of Heaven
254,jimboduck,An Overly Orchestrated Mess -- 3 (Total waste in every respect),3,11 July 2005,"This movie was absolutely terrible. The bottom line is that two hours of a deliberately serious score backing forced close-ups of grim faces is mind-numbingly boring and approaches being torture when you pay 1800 yen for a movie ticket and are strapped into a theater seat with obligations to not walk out on your friends.As KINGDOM OF HEAVEN ticked slowly from second to second, I grew increasingly confused. What's happening in this movie? Orlando Bloom is here, now he's there, now he's on his way elsewhere. Am I supposed to care? I don't know why, but I couldn't' bring myself to being least bit interested in the plot at all. It's as if the movie were intentionally made to be boring. So I sat back in my chair, closed my eyes, and prayed to God that KINGDOM OF HEAVEN would miraculously shift gears and transform into a movie that didn't suck bad.Such divine salvation failed to appear, and I was left forsaken,eyes-closed in my theater seat trying to block out the drone of this movie's script, praying to a heaven I did not know.Imagine with me if you can a heavily orchestrated score, something that with strings and brass says ""Things are very serious now. I need to make a big decision, and everything is so  serious."" Now imagine the face of your favorite middle-aged European, say Liam Neeson, looking off-screen and taking a deep sigh, then another for that extra-drama effect. Then he says something distinctly royal, like ""Let it written let it be done,"" turns around with Jedi robe flowing, and walks out of the room.While this type of scene is effective at times, you can't loop it repeatedly for two, three hours, can you? That's what I thought, but that's exactly what Ridley Scott dishes out in KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. There's too much music, too many minutes wasted on serious faces, and too much chivalry.Even Jeremy Irons leaves this movie about two-thirds way through. He pleads with Orlando Bloom, ""Don't waste any more time, lad. It's a lost cause. If I were you, I'd round up your troops and high foot it out of the kingdom of heaven."" I urge you all to follow Irons' lead, except do it early on before suffering another minute of this God forsaken mess.JYJimboduck-dot-com",Kingdom of Heaven
255,DrMMGilchrist,The Man in the Silver Mask steals film from Bloom's anachronistic Bildungsroman hero,6,10 May 2005,"(Now refers to Director's Cut) In theatrical and director's cut alike, 'Kingdom of Heaven' is a botched opportunity. It has spectacular cinematography, and is highly atmospheric, but would have been better if Scott and Monahan had used more of the real story. It suffers from problems common to historical films and novels: the fictionalised hero's travails are irritating, and the sympathetic characters' anachronistic attitudes break suspension of disbelief. All the heroes express open-minded religious/moral values of a post-Enlightenment, near-Unitarian nature, which would have got them burnt in the 12C; more plausibly mediæval mind-sets belong to the villains. Monahan's interpretation of characters and incidents are based on now-outdated historiography, e.g. the depiction of Patriarch Eraclius, in reality a competent figure. The attempts to make the story an anti-imperialist parable for contemporary Middle-Eastern conflicts fail, too, because they are built on misunderstandings of the 12C situation and modern cultural guilt-tripping. The history is interesting in itself; why strain after 'contemporary relevance'? My chief reason for rating it above DeMille's 'The Crusades' is that at least it leaves my favourite Crusades character off-screen and unscathed! The battles aspire to the standard of Peter Jackson's Tolkien films: Jerusalem is Helm's Deep and Minas Tirith without the unusual wildlife. (I kept expecting Orlando to skate downstairs on his shield while firing arrows...) His charge at Kerak is Faramir's suicide mission crossed with the ride of the Rohirrim. There is a superfluous shipwreck, yet the dramatic - and vital - battle of Hattin, in which the real Balian and Raymond fought, happens off-screen. The importance of the military orders in the Kingdom's defence is diminished. The personal conflict between Raymond and Templar Grand Master Gerard de Ridefort is replaced by depicting all Templars as 'baddies', in the Walter Scott tradition.Orlando Bloom's 'Balian' strains credulity. Only his defence of Jerusalem and negotiation of its surrender connect him with the real Balian d'Ibelin. Balian was in his 40s, an Outremer-born baron of Italian descent: not illegitimate, not French, never a village wright and smith. He married King Amaury I's Byzantine widow Maria, and did not have an affair with Sibylla (Amaury's daughter by his first wife). So far, so 'Braveheart', in gratuitous inaccuracy...Sibylla (played by Eva Green) is equally misrepresented. She was devoted to Guy, refusing to divorce him when pressed to: hardly a casual adulteress. ***SPOILER*** She was not regent for her son, Baldwin of Montferrat - Raymond of Tripoli was. The child was not a leper (leprosy is not hereditary or easy to catch), and she did not kill him: he simply died young. The tacked-on 'happy ending' is absurd. She died in the siege of Acre in 1190. And I'm sure she'd *rather* have died than go to live in a village with a blacksmith. In the feudal 1180s, you didn't 'downshift'.Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas) is portrayed as a scheming villain, dressed as a Templar. 'Scheming' suggests a degree of intelligence few writers associate with Guy: not evil, but over-enthusiastically chivalrous, easily led, and simply unlucky. After Sibylla's death, his claim to the throne crumbled, and by then nobody wanted him apart from Richard Oc-e-Non (a cameo-role from Iain Glen) - because he was one of his Poitevin vassals. (Richard also figures in a script gaffe: Sibylla, teaching her son geography, says he is King of England, having succeeded Henry II: in fact, Henry (her cousin) outlived her son by about 3 years!)Four characters are vaguely recognisable: Baldwin IV (Ed Norton) is the true hero of the film: a gifted, noble and courageous 24-year-old, dying of leprosy. Even finally seeing the ghastly disfigurement behind his serene silver mask does not erase the viewer's perception of his real beauty: his character. The true extent of his disability is played down, however: in his last years, he was blind and crippled, but still went on campaign in a litter, tended by his mother. Also, he is portrayed as essentially peace-loving; in fact, he was a hard-fighting Angevin warrior-king, Henry II's first cousin. And he would not have spurned the sacrament from the Patriarch.Jeremy Irons plays Count Raymond of Tripoli - but the film (to avoid confusion with Tripoli in Libya) changes his title to Tiberias (in reality, held by his wife). He looks very much the wise, wily, battle-scarred Raymond I've loved. However, the film strikes a wrong note in claiming he withdraws in self-imposed exile to Cyprus. He fought at Hattin, and died of pleurisy - and a broken heart - in Tripoli, aged 47, during the siege of Jerusalem.Saladin (Ghassan Massoud) also lives up to expectations: brave, tough, charismatic, and shrewd. It is good to see him played by a Middle-Eastern actor, not - as in previous Crusade films - a Western actor in brown make-up, but his ruthlessness is played down. He would have invaded with or without provocation. Reynaud de Châtillon (Brendan Gleeson) is portrayed as opportunistic and violent as he was, but is dressed as a Templar, which he wasn't. Nor did he kill, or even abduct, Saladin's sister. However, his execution by Saladin is a high point of the film: one of the few scenes taken faithfully from contemporary sources.There are moments when the film takes wing into magnificence: Baldwin's meeting with Saladin in front of their armies, the True Cross flashing in the sun; Saladin praying over his slain soldiers. (I could have done with more in-period music accompanying these images, too.) But Balian's tedious Bildungsroman and anachronistic moralising drag it back to earth. If the real story is to be changed and fictionalised so heavily, why not change the names and set it in a fantasy universe? Why pretend to verisimilitude? I *might just* forgive Ridley Scott if he makes an *accurate* sequel that opens with a ship from Constantinople pulling into the beleaguered port of Tyre, and a dashing, 42-ish blond Italian coming ashore and taking command of the defences...",Kingdom of Heaven
256,artemis_5,A Very Earthly Kingdom,9,17 October 2005,"The term ""kingdom of heaven"" takes on many meanings in the movie ""Kingdom of Heaven"" as it did in reality, referring both to the city of Jerusalem, and the border-less kingdom on earth that belongs to Yahweh or Allah (depending on your religion). Inspite of media reports that suggested that Ridley Scott's film was jumping on the bandwagon of religious films that began with ""The Passion of the Christ,"" the ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is not really a religious film. While the city means a great deal to certain people on both sides of the Christian/Muslim conflict, to most of the characters in the movie its just a piece of land that they happen to reside on. When the opportunity arises to exit it peacefully, the news is greeted with cheers.The story revolves around Balian, a young French blacksmith who finds out at the beginning of the film that he is the illegitimate son of a crusading knight, Lord Godfrey (Liam Neeson). Balian has just lost his child, and his wife in despair has committed suicide, condemning her (in the eyes of the Catholic church) to eternity in hell. After Balian takes revenge on a despicable priest who abuses Balain's wife corpse and steals her cross from around her neck, Balain is forced to flee his village. His father invites him to join him in a crusade to defend the holy land from Muslim attack, promising wealth, and salvation for Balian and his dead wife. So father and son set off for the holy land, but Godfrey dies in route, leaving Balain with his title and his lands; as well as knighting him in what is one of a few morally significant scenes. Before he dies, Godfrey commands his son to defend the king of Jerusalem, and when the king dies, to defend the people. This is an oath which Balian takes to heart, and it becomes his ""golden rule"" throughout the film.Although the audience in lead to believe by the first few minutes of the film, as well as by the religious significance of Jerusalem that Balian is going to undergo some spiritual awakening by the end of the movie, in reality he does not really develop ""a personal relationship"" with God. His social awakening occurs with his knighting by his father, and his moral outlook remains the same throughout the rest of the movie. Godfrey, the Hospitaler, Baldwin IV (""the Leper King"") all seem to share Balian's philosophy, which I would describe as secular humanism. No one seems to have genuine religious beliefs, neither on the side of the Christians nor on the Muslims. Other than shouts of ""God wills it"" and ""may Allah give us victory,"" which serve more as arrogant slogans than genuine expressions of faith, there is little reliance on God. In fact, if not for the political significance of the holy land, I think that the film could have been set in any town in the world, and the ending would not have been any less powerful.Sybilla in turn does not really seem to have a philosophy other than to try to survive in a world in which women are given in marriage to men they do not know when they are fifteen, and true love requires that one sin against his or her religious beliefs. Indeed, of the three major relationships she has in the movie, the one between her brother and her is more moving than either of her sexual ones.The one controversial aspect of this film, which may have made it unpopular with some Christians, is that it points out the harshness of medieval Christianity, which unfortunately included corrupt clergy, holy wars against innocent people, and the declaration that an otherwise good person like Balian's wife could go to hell simply for being desperate enough to kill herself. Not to mention the dilemma that Sybilla faces between abiding by wedding vows she did not consent to take and finding love with Balian.This is one of those films where no one gives a bad performance, and the visuals are just stunning. I liked it a great deal, although the siege of Jerusalem lasted a little too long.",Kingdom of Heaven

I liked the romance that was kind of obviously going to happen between the girl and guy (I don't remember their names) Also, I liked the idea of the two knights who were trying to corrupt the place with war. And when Ge came king. Tat was good because it showed the difference between a good king and an obviously bad one. My favourite characters: The King, by far and the first one with leprosy, Orlando's character, the cool German guy who got an arrow/stake through his throat, the old Baron, and the guy who said ""your enemy will always know good quality....""

258,hengir,Dull,6,10 October 2006,"A film about Jerusalem at the time of the Crusades has the potential to be very interesting, with all kinds of resonances possible. However 'Kingdom of Heaven' isn't one like that. It had no feel for the historical period and had no contemporary echoes. Being a Ridley Scott film it did look gorgeous. Too gorgeous. It was beautifully crafted but absolutely airless. The costumes were lovely, the scenery was lovely, the spurts of blood were lovely. Everything perfect and lifeless. Indeed I found it dull.One of its other main problems was Orlando Bloom as Balian. He seemed to have the same expression and the same tone of voice throughout the film. It might have been deliberate or bad acting but the result was the same. You did not believe in the character for one moment. The declaiming of the speech where he rouses the men for the last stand was laughably lame. Compare that say to Mel Gibson's 'Braveheart' battle speech. No contest. The most interesting character was that played by Liam Neeson but unfortunately he didn't last long.Near the end is the siege of Jerusalem but if you've seen one computer generated battle you've seen them all. I almost expected Gimli and Aragorn to pop up and have a go at the Saracens. It was the biggest set piece and it too was boring. The music score was unsurprising but had lots of nice tunes.

He killed for no noble reasons, and he jumped to bed with Sibylla as fast as Paris did with Helen in Troy. He had refused to take up leadership offered by the King and thus forfeited the opportunity to avoid a war. So Balian still behaved like a common blacksmith and Bloom is desperately in need for some acting-training lessons.OK, the last bit, people fought like mad for days, thousands were killed. Yet the 2 leaders took only 30 seconds to compromise, shook hands and left in peace, as if nothing had happened. Those who had sacrificed would feel so cheated that they'll turn in their graves.

263,asalem182,"Another summer, another epic, another disappointment",6,8 May 2005,"Kingdom Of Heaven is a movie that will keep you entertained while you watch it, but i guess many people ( including me ), were expecting much more than entertainment when they walked in to see it.Ridley Scott reinvented the epic genre in 2000 when he made gladiator. That movie won the Oscar for best movie, as well as being a commercial hit. Since 2000, we have seen a lot of epic movies that tried to repeat the success of Gladiator, with little success. The 3 epic movies released last year ( Troy, King Arthur, and Alexander ), were all considered disappointments either commercially or artistically or both. That's why when i heard that Ridley was going to make an epic about the Crusades, i thought he was going to make a movie that will redefine the genre again, unfortunately, he didn't.Don't get me wrong, I thought Ridley did a great job here. The movie is visually stunning. The first battle scene in the snow, and the final battle scene are bigger and better than anything in Troy. The cinematography is very good too. The movie's main problems in my opinion are the story, the fear of controversy and the performance of Orlando Bloom.The Story by William Monahan failed to make us connect with or relate to any character. All the characters, apart from the character from Orlando Bloom, are given little screen time, and as a result, we didn't get to know these characters well, and there were almost no character development.The film makers didn't want to cause controversy and upset the Muslims or Christians, so they tried to balance the movie. What i mean is, if they have a character in the Christian camp seeking peace between Muslims and Christians, then they must have a character in the Muslim camp seeking peace too, and so on. That led to repeated and unnecessary dialogue. That also led to not having a real villain, therefore the viewer didn't know what camp to root for.I think Orlando Bloom gave a so-so performance of the lead character. What makes it worse it that he's surronded by first rate actors who all gave excellent performances, especially Edward Norton, Ghassan Massoud, and Eva Green. Without the performances of these actors i would have given the movie a 5.The score of the movie was good, i liked that it was varied between oriental, western, and opera. Also the movie had a good message, but as I said the delivery wasn't as good.So overall, i recommend watching Kingdom Of Heaven, it has excellent battle scenes, very good acting and a solid score. You won't be bored while you watch it. Just don't expect it to be as good as gladiator in terms of story, and character development, because if you do, you will certainly be disappointed.",Kingdom of Heaven
264,lornloxor,The Director's Cut is an Epic Masterpice!,10,30 July 2013,"Ridley Scott's epic Kingdom of Heaven explores the roots of our modern religious conflicts in the context of the Crusades during the 12th century. The Crusades are really such a monumental piece of history and there hasn't really been a good epic that's been made about them before this movie. And what a film it is. I actually believe this to be Ridley Scott's finest film yet.The way the Fox executives screwed up the theatrical release of this epic movie is one of the worst failures in modern Hollywood history in my opinion. If the director's cut had been released in the theaters, it probably would've won an Oscar for best picture and a few others. The theatrical version felt extremely rushed with horrible pacing. There was no way you could really empathize with the characters and care about them. Nothing felt right about it, there was no natural flow to it. The dialogue made no sense and you really had to wonder who they were referring to. That is no way to do an epic. The director's cut changed all of that. It's an absolutely amazing masterpiece, I've never seen such a difference between the original and the director's cut. Ridley Scott at the top of his craft, no doubt about it. There's more exposition, more character development and many loose ends are tied up. The story is great and full of political and religious intrigue.The casting in the movie is fantastic. Many have criticized the choice of Orlando Bloom for the lead but I liked it. Bloom's character isn't Maximus. He uses his intellect and cunning to defeat his enemies rather than brute strength. Crowe would also be too old for the role because with him in the movie you'd have to recast Liam Neeson who plays Balian's father. I thought Bloom did a great job with Balian, definitely his best performance in his career. Balian's character arc drives the movie very well. At the start he captures the emptiness of Balian so well and later his noble and modern outlook is nicely juxtaposed with the medieval setting. The rest of the cast is also uniformly fantastic. Edward Norton's portrayal of the leper king Baldwin IV is flawless and captivating. A true achievement considering he is behind a mask the entire movie. Ghassan Massoud portrays the stoic and severe Saladin impressively. Eva Green's princess Sibylla really shines and becomes more sympathetic in the director's cut where she is portrayed as a more complete character with understandable motives for her actions. Bloom and Green also definitely have some chemistry in their romantic scenes. Marton Csokas is fantastic as the arrogant Guy de Lusignan, Balian's nemesis. Brendan Gleeson is great as the vicious Reynald de Chatillon. There's not a bad performance in the entire movie.The cinematography is truly fantastic and mesmerizing. France during the Dark Ages is conveyed beautifully in a blue tone and we can see why people would want to escape that world and join the Crusades and travel to the warmly lit Holy Land. The movie is full of beautifully set up shots and meticulous set designs. The costumes are really impeccable and play an important part in the movie. Ridley Scott really is a master at creating lived in, believable worlds. The battle scenes were grittily realistic and brutal. You really felt that people were getting severely hurt and killed in them. The CGI use was seamless and it looked very impressive. Harry Gregson-Williams' score is epic and so fitting. The score mixes medieval, middle-eastern and modern themes beautifully. I get chills just thinking about the music in this movie. The music really adds a powerful emotional component to many scenes.With the bonus features in the director's cut we get to see how thoroughly the film crew researched for the movie and also witness the struggles they had with the production. There's a long documentary called 'Path to Redemption' about how the movie came to be and numerous featurettes about set design, costumes and so on. The documentary is one of the best behind-the-scenes documentaries out there. There's also a segment called Creative accuracy - The scholars speak where historians discuss the historical accuracy of the film and what liberties they took in the movie. All really interesting stuff and presented well. Some have also complained about the ways the movie took liberties with historical facts. For example, Saladin didn't really let everyone leave freely from Jerusalem, the people actually had to pay a ransom to get their freedom or be thrown into slavery. I don't see this as a problem. Modern society is too far removed from the brutality of the crusades to really allow a realistic portrayal of the events. Filmmakers have to be allowed to have artistic freedom to create likable and unlikeable characters who you can identify with for the sake of drama and tension. If any of us met a true to life person from the Dark Ages, I really doubt we would like any of them very much. When you're making a movie, you have to dramatize. You simply can't have every single character and detail in it just like it's in the history books. This is a romanticized impression of the Crusades and it simply works. Well, there you have it. Do yourself a favor and watch the director's cut because it's a genuine masterpiece. You won't be disappointed.",Kingdom of Heaven
265,Boris-57,"Boy, this stank",2,28 May 2005,"Basically, yesterday after I'd seen it, I was still moderately mild to this film, but in hindsight that was probably due to the welcome air conditioning in the theater, when outside it was a blisteringly hot late spring day (so I actually enjoyed every minute inside). In fact, apart from some visuals and the set design, this movie was not only bad, but completely superfluous, for these reasons: The plot is next to non-existent, something which does not necessarily lead to a bad film, but here, what *is* contained in the plot is (a) mind-numbingly bad dialogue, (b) a historically completely inaccurate storyline, (c) uninteresting characters, (d) uninteresting, inconsistent and sometimes completely obscure plot 'developments'. An still...Still, those four points would not necessarily make it the disaster it is. The disaster is here: is completely fails to even *hint* at what the atmosphere at the time of the crusades must have been like. I mean, the whole of it is steeped in western romanticism and something which tries to sell itself as idealism, but which is, in fact, just squeamish political correctness. This PC is necessary, because the romanticizing makes it look more contemporary than it is. And, true, some current political problems do have its roots in the same idea of 'posessing the ultimate truth' that inhabits monotheistic religions. But why not stick to history. For, in fact, there are lots of deeper analogies as well as differences between the machinations at the time of the crusades and what goes on nowadays. In fact, religion as religion, ironically, plays only a minor part in it. It's religion as a means of mobilising the masses as an army ready to kill and die for a power-hungry elite.In all, there's too much individualism going on in the film, and you never get even a glimpse of the whole picture. Yes, it is true that in the dark middle ages the Muslim culture, though cruel as practically all ancient cultures, was more refined than the European one (due to circumstances). And yes, what went to fight in the Holy Land were often a bunch of outlaws and adventurers, sinners, and religious fanatics (a bit like the earlier gulfs of emigration to the Americas and Australia, come to think of it :-). But in all fairness, it was a pretty brutal time then. And all these high ideals and stuff, that just drowned in the murk of complex political en demographical plots that this movie not only fails to explore, but which it pretends even never existed.O yes - and they DO spell e-ve-ry-thing out for you. Good grief Hollywood, we can think! PS If you want a cool epic battle movie with some completely absurd individualism and pretty idiotic behavior, but which actually manages to entertain, see Musa (The Warrior) by Sung-su Kim (Korea, 2001). At least is goes, without holding back, for full-fledged romanticism and does not try to rewrite history as a politically correct story of noble white and black men.",Kingdom of Heaven

267,ctg0724,better than gladiator,10,20 July 2007,"I just watched Gladiator for the first time in a long time a few minutes ago. It really is a terrific movie. We can all thank Ridley Scott for bringing back the historical genre. But if I had to compare the two films (and I'm sure just about everyone feels the need to compare them), I must say I felt a much stronger pull from Kingdom of Heaven. There were two things Gladiator had that Kingdom of Heaven did not. The first is the villainous character like Commodous. The second was the commanding presence of the hero, Maximus (Orlando still did good as Balian of Ibelin). It was also very operatic. But other than those things, it doesn't have anything superior to KoH. Both had this in common. They meant to stress the importance of the places the people were fighting for. This is where I think Kingdom of Heaven was done better. In Gladiator, they went on and on about what Rome was, but they never really showed what was so amazing about it. IN KoH, I really get a magical sense of what Jerusalem was supposed to be. However, after everything I just said, the two films shouldn't be compared for what's better. I almost consider KoH a sequel to Gladiator. And I can also say there would not be a KoH without Gladiator. I hope to see more of these cinematic masterpieces from Ridley.",Kingdom of Heaven

269,iamsam103,Directors Cut is a MUST see!,9,30 December 2006,"I won't make an essay for this film as I tend to do sometimes, so I'll keep this short.I saw the Theatrical release at the cinema and really liked the film. It was epic, gritty and emotional and clearly defined Scott as the king of ""sword and sandal epics"". However, it was missing something. The film seemed incomplete and didn't answer half as many questions as people would have liked. I for one was impressed with Bloom's acting, it seemed he was only good as an elf and although he's adequate in Pirates of the Caribbean, he's never excelled in my opinion until now.From the moment I saw the film, there was the news of Scott releasing a Director's cut DVD...so I waited...and waited. And finally, it arrived and I bought it. The film has plenty of additional scenes which makes the film all the more grand. Character's have more of a back-story and there's an added sub-story of Sibylla's child becoming King. Bloom's acting really excels even more in this version, as you can truly sense the depression, anger and frustration his character is going to.This director's cut is a MUST see for any Scott fan or Crusades buff. It's just as brilliant as the first but 10x better!!! If you have to see this film, this is the version you want to see...it's just a shame Fox made Scott shorten the film otherwise I'm sure the response to this film's theatrical release would have been extremely different!",Kingdom of Heaven

Glorous set designs and and overall just convincingly grand look. A story that lets both the Muslims and the Europeans be human. Very nice and relatively (note relatively!) nuanced and thoughtful.There are probably lots of historical inaccuracies here but i refuse to let that spoil my fun. The only thing that really hold this film back was 1.Orlanda Bloom. Not a good actor and not with enough presence to carry a long film on his shoulder, especially when the character he plays is rahter boring as well. 2. The fairytale way Balian reached his position and the sheer stupidety of him somehow turning from a smith to a great fighter. There is just no way for someone to match people that were trained with swords from young age.But i was willing to look by such things. Well-placed musings on religion and a critical outlook on the crusade in general combined with a rather exciting adventure. Thats good right.",Kingdom of Heaven
271,cox526,More from Ridley Please,8,11 May 2005,"More please at last a film director who can make a medieval epic great- Troy and Alexander pale into insignificance by comparison. I agree with Dick Steels comments as they sum it up a treat. I did find it a bit long winded in places as the story unfolds but at least it tells a story unlike the pitiful Alexander - Why didn't they let Ridley make that? It has so much of Lord of the Rings battle scene and the love story of Gladiator entwined within it. A lot has been said of casting Orlando Bloom in the role of the hero- he isn't a Brad Pitt or Russel Crowe so admittedly he doesn't come across as powerful as an Achilles or a Maximus, but then I can see why he was so cast because as Ballion the Blacksmith he was thrown into a war he wasn't keen on and made a reluctant hero of that war- just by default he was the son of Godfrey a noble baron who was greatly admired in Jerusalem. It is a testament to Ridley Scott that he touches on the religious aspect of the film with great care highlighting that man can live in peace if he so wishes but then he can be fanatical and love war as was so much the case of the crusades - As Jeremy Irons says I used to think that I was fighting for Religion now I realise it was for wealth and power. A brilliantly told tale even if it may not be historically accurate and the battle scenes epic and memorable. I can't wait to see when Hollywood will let Ridly loose with many millions to make a true epic- that will be even more worth watching as this was.",Kingdom of Heaven
272,ignatz928,Not much more successful than the real Crusades,4,15 June 2005,"Ridley Scott's new historical action epic makes me feel a lot better about his previous movie in this genre, Gladiator. Gladiator's revenge plot was as simplistic as Death Wish but also as straightforward, and the movie didn't have to make any excuses for it. Scott's choice of subject for Kingdom of Heaven- the Crusades- may have been bolder in its relevance to contemporary events, but, as if in compensation, everything else about the movie is cautious and calculated. Technically speaking, it's actually set in the period just before the Third Crusade, showing Saladin's defeat of the Crusader kingdoms and re-conquest of Jerusalem. Orlando Bloom plays Balian, a French blacksmith who is the bastard son of a knight, played by Liam Neeson, with holdings in the Middle East. Balian, consumed with grief after his wife's suicide, decides to accept when his father stops by with an offer to accompany him back to the Holy Land. Soon after they arrive, Balian's father dies, but not before making him a knight and heir to his land. Balian is soon caught up in a power struggle between the king, a leper who has kept the peace between different faiths, and the Templar Knights, who want to make war on the Muslims. The actual position of the Muslims in all of this is a little uncertain, since they don't seem to have any plans of their own, instead preferring to just wait around and wait for the Christians to provoke war. The movie's basic problem is that, except for the villains, none of the characters actually want to take part in the Crusades. This is basically a gambit by Scott and his writers to avoid as much controversy as possible and to keep a wide audience's sympathy with the heroes, but it also drains the life from the story. Instead of initiating the action, the protagonist simply reacts to the situation created by the villains. He doesn't even have any real conflict with the fanatical Templars, since they are killed along with the bulk of the Christians' forces in an early battle with Saladin, leaving Balian to defend the city by himself. Instead of grand passions and solemn vows, this epic centers on dutiful commitment. It doesn't help matters to cast Orlando Bloom as the main character. He was fine in his pretty limited role in Lord of the Rings, but despite his fan base of several million teenage girls, he doesn't feel like a star here- Bloom lacks the sort of force and charisma that might have pulled the film together. Of course, in large part the problem lies with his character, who is so conflicted and uncertain that he never actually does anything. It would take a very good actor to bring this character to life, and Bloom is not that actor. To be fair to the movie, Scott's visuals are as stunning as ever, and the sets and costumes convincingly recreate the historical period, even if the screenplay fails to do the same. The battle scenes display the same faults and virtues as in Gladiator; while very impressively filmed, they are also shot in so close and edited so frantically that it's often difficult if not impossible to tell what's going on. Scott may be trying to convey the chaos of battle, but I'd wish he could do that without resorting to similar chaos in his film-making.",Kingdom of Heaven
273,gink10,David Thewlis Filmography Project,3,27 September 2019,"#34 Kingdom of Heaven (Director's Cut Version)Hospitaler = The Angelical CharacterPros: This is possibly the best epic adventure directed by Ridley Scott for several reasons: it's not as crowded, it's not as commercial at all or pretentious for a Hollywood movie and finally because it's somehow very underrated. Ok, now let's talk a little about the character of David, if you see the theatrical version of the film maybe you have a concept in which you can come to think that he is a mortal person like all other characters, a simple man who helps injured and sick people during the crusades and who also supports Balian (Orlando Bloom) in some way, but if you see the director's version all these changes completely in terms of Hospitaler's perspective and insinuates that maybe he is an angel or a mystic being (?). Good cast especially David, Eva Green and Jeremy Irons for me are the most clinging to the majesty of this film.Cons: I think everyone will agree with me that Orlando Bloom is not exactly the best actor to be the main character of this film, who would have told him it could be an excellent choice, the rest of the cast helps his character to shine from time to time (but Orlando is inexpressive and cold, I'm sorry). If you don't like the stories about the Crusades or this era as well as the things they explain throughout the film in general, maybe you don't have any interest in seeing it.",Kingdom of Heaven
274,siit,It's awesome potential was not even closely reached.,6,8 May 2005,"I waited with unabated anticipation when I heard Ridley Scott was the genius behind the camera. As the marketing machine liked to ram down our throats 'from the maker of Gladiator', my mouth was watering at the prospect of awesome battle scenes and the attention to detail.Well it started brilliantly, Liam Neeson certainly portrays the heroic knight as if the role was tailored for him. The first fight scene was excellent with realism, gusto and fantastic camera work.From there...It simply deteriorated. The concept Ridley tried to instill of the Knight's code of honour was weakly done, the battle scenes just seemed to be rushed and to be honest were rather boring.The Roman battle scene in Gladiator far eclipsed anything in Kingdom of Heaven. I was left wondering whether battle tactics had degenerated in the 1000 years or so, or whether Ridley had run out of money, or had simply lost interest in the project.Orlando Bloom at times seemed to struggle with the disjointed writing of his character, but overall he was somewhat believable.David Thewlis and especially Liam Neeson shined and seemed to personify what Knights should be. Unfortunately without giving away spoilers I am unable to express my feelings towards Ridley Scott here. The Queen's character was OK, but on the whole she was extremely annoying and it seemed Ridley wanted to introduce her to totally slow down the continuity and frustrate the audience.You get introduced to 'bad guys' and then your left confused and further frustrated without a lot of resolution to many things. If you are expecting a standard showdown of good and bad guy, you will be sorely disappointed.I truly believe that this movie has to be seriously boosted in Ridley's famous 'Director's Cut'... it has too, because the screen version is extremely disappointing, too disjointed, and hurried. This is one movie I will definitely not be wasting money again on a ticket to re-see.",Kingdom of Heaven
275,StoryCharts,Unwavering good is the only way to save our souls,5,19 July 2013,"Kingdom of Heaven is about one man's dedication to be the perfect knight in order to protect the innocent civilians of Jerusalem. He seeks redemption for having murdered his own half-brother and sticks to his principles and refuses to ""do a little evil for a greater good"". In the end he gives up the city of Jerusalem to save its inhabitants.The primary plot of the movie is and external quest: battles to save Jerusalem. The turning points of the main plot are driven by internal and relationship struggles: the knight trying to do the moral thing and giving up fortune and love in the process.Unfortunately, probably because I watched the extended version of the movie, the main plot doesn't get going until half way through the movie. The back story up to the knight's arrival in Jerusalem (which doesn't include a lot of key turning points) wastes more than an hour of screen time before the main story gets rolling. And the first significant turning point is the knight having an affair with the princess, making his later choices of staying squeaky clean as a moral knight seem hollow and arbitrary. The knight, aside from the justified murder at the beginning of the film, doesn't go through much of an arc: he is good near the beginning and stays good to the end. The redemption arc of the princess is a little more interesting but less relevant since she's not our protagonist. So we end up watching a squeaky clean ""good"" guy go through heroic actions against clearly ""bad"" guys and watch the very expense set piece battles. Unfortunately internal and relationship driving forces feel hollow. I might have been distracted enough by the action to not really care, but at 3 hours long (the extended version) its hard to not notice the slack internal and relationship arcs.Some ways that might have made it better: cut the entire first act prior to his arrival in Jerusalem, yes including his dad Liam Neeson so the main story gets going right away. Make the protagonist go through more of an arc: place some of his not so good choices into the middle of the story so we don't watch a ""good"" guy go through 2.5 hours being a goody two shoes. Make his redemption less about his mourning of his perfect wife since he goes around sleeping with a married princess. Or: just admit that this is a simple Action film so pack all the action into 90 minutes so we have no time to worry about the internal and relationship arcs.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca",Kingdom of Heaven

278,meako1973,Bloom-ing terrible acting!,5,4 May 2005,"The casting of Orlando Bloom in a lead role was a dangerous gambit for Ridley Scott to take. Did he see in Orlando some untapped potential, like Scorcese did with DiCaprio? Would we finally see a performance from Orlando which equated to more than just reading lines, and staring into the distance? Well, the answer to that is no, and this film suffers because of it.Kingdom of Heaven is set during the first Crusades. Bloom plays a blacksmith, Balian, who discovers that his father is a Baron and a crusader in the Holy Lands. Leaving his home with his father he travels to Jerusalem to try to find forgiveness from God, but ends up taking his father's place, becoming a close companion to the King, and making an enemy of the next in line to the throne. Pretty soon war between the crusaders and the Muslims arises.This could have been a really good film! Really, it could! Unfortunately despite a decent story, in which neither side is shown as evil, some gripping and brutal action, and a scattering of strong supporting cast, the whole feel of the film is flat. The main reason for this is that extremely uncharismatic Bloom who, in a role where he is built to be a leader of men, looks totally out of place. You end up wondering why the people turn to such a bland personality to lead them into battle! It makes no sense. Bloom does his usual 'one facial expression' performance throughout the film, and it makes it impossible to engage with him, or emote in any way. If we can't emote with the lead character in such a powerful film, then the whole feel is lost. Other performances on offer serve to the detriment of the tale, such as the role of the second in line to the throne, Guy, which is played in the style of Bill Bailey! Over the past 10 years Ridley Scott has made a lot of average films, which people have praised as 'the next best thing since sliced Hovis'. With the majority of them, such as Gladiator or Matchstick Men, they were pretty dull films lifted up by the charisma of the stars. With Kingdom of Heaven what would have been good is dragged down by terrible performances. If Russell Crowe were in the lead role, it would have made a huge difference! Even Liam Neeson could have raised it up if he were the focus of the whole film! I would have believed more if Jeremy Irons' character were the one to lead the peopleI'd follow him into battle (if only on the hope he finds a piano and sings ""PlayAway""  but that's off on a tangent!) No, we are left with Bloom, and a role that is far above his station.Overall the film was average. It didn't really drag, and some of the battles (or the lack of in places) are really intense. Just a shame that the cast can't live up to the tale.",Kingdom of Heaven
279,srdikano,Flagrant Atrocity,1,7 May 2005,"Riddley Scott should be whipped to death for this abomination. Kingdom of Heaven is bad, bad, bad. From almost every possible angle.For starters: there is no plot. Well, ""some hype Hollywood actor goes to Jerusalem to fight for some king for some pseudo-profound reason"". Period. That's your plot. Settle for it. The rest is nothing but the rantings of an untalented director who fails miserably in giving his euphoric vision any sort of understandable shape.The warmongering, fanatic Christians seem overly eager to meet a certain death against the Sarracens ... for no apparent reason.The princess falls in love with our hero in 5"", by clock, breaking each and every cliché speed record out there.The bad guy gets punished, the good guy wins the battles, the hot girl goes through some deep, emotional turn-moils to discover her true self giving one ""memorable"" performance and everybody lives happily ever after but the viewers of this outrage.Clearly, the writer of this abhorrent big-screen soap opera should not have had that last Malibú lobotomy. Not again, at least. This script belongs in the pooper and nowhere else, and you'll know what i mean when you have to put up with the obnoxious, far-fetched dialogs in this ""movie"".As well, you'd think with nowadays technology, you could at least rely on some nice, brutal, gory battles. Well, no. This movie is the proof of it. After Lord of the Rings, i must admit us viewers have quite a picky palate for these things, but still, the battles in Kingdom of Heaven fall short of mediocre. Repeated tricks, repeated styles, repeated directing and repeated yawns. Plenty of yawns.The first few minutes of the siege of Jerusalem are pretty entertaining, but then the cadence becomes monotonous, the scenes prolong way too much and the action turns boring by ... imagine ... repetition! This ""movie"" will seem to last forever. And it will.As for the actors, there's not much to say. No one here will win an Oscar (much less a serious award). Specially Orlando Bloom, who is a never ending geyser of nightmares to those who appreciate good acting. His main character delivers ... nothing. Wait! Did i say ""nothing""? I meant NOTHING! Nothing whatsoever. Much a la Keanu Reeves, Bloom seems completely devoid of any emotion. The lack of strength in his acting leaves his character battling for the title of protagonist. Bloom shall be a tough contestant in this year's Razzie Awards.What a frustrating ""movie"". It even made me think Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" was a good movie in comparison. Just imagine! Nonetheless, and truth be told, this movie has a one very, very positive aspect (that wins it 2 of the 3 points i gave it): Muslims are presented with dignity, like real, average, normal religious people. Furthermore, roles are reversed: it is the catholics who play as mindless fanatics and the Muslims who play the coherent and truly enlightened ones. Saladin is by far the most sophisticated character in the movie! This, coming from an American production is simply priceless and absolutely worthy of my utmost respect. Still, the movie remains a flamboyant fluke and will definitely go down in flames as the B-movie it is ... but it'll do so with a very respectable shred of decorum.My advice: save yourself from the embarrassment and save your money; you're better off spending it on cheap drugs and cheap prostitutes than in this abortion of cinematography.",Kingdom of Heaven
280,Reviewer746,a movie you won't forget,10,19 February 2015,"I'm convinced that someone involved in the production of this film is being shunned by Hollywood. That's the only reason I can think of that this movie would get so many bad reviews online. Not negative reviews necessarily, just bad reviews. Do not allow said reviews to dissuade you from watching this film. Be especially cautious of reviews complaining about the CGI or comparing this film to Lord of the Rings - these people clearly have not seen the film.As for my own review: Kingdom of Heaven is one of the finest installments in the action/adventure genre that I've ever seen. The Moving Picture Company's CGI is artfully done. The sweeping action sequences are not only believable but downright awe inspiring. The plot progresses at a steady, appropriate pace. Orlando Bloom, playing the role of nonchalant humanist knight, gives an unremarkable if not somewhat lacking performance but this is more than made up for by the strong performances of the other actors including and especially David Thewlis (Hospitaler), Edward Norton (King Baldwin IV), and Ghassan Massoud (Saladin).On first seeing this film, my expectations for historical accuracy were extremely low. I was surprised by how closely this film is based on real historical events and would encourage viewers to look into the history for themselves. Just the fact that there was an actual Balian of Ibelin who defended Jerusalem from Saladin came as a big surprise to me. That said, there is a pretty good amount of artistic liberty taken in the plot. For some reason this bothers a lot of people. I guess I'm just not one of those people. If you want to see a strictly historically accurate account of the events of the second crusade, I would suggest watching a documentary or, better yet, reading the vast amount of literature that exists. Frankly, I don't see the point of writing a negative review of a film on the basis of historical inaccuracy other than to showboat your own historical knowledge (or ability to browse Wikipedia).The film is an obvious political allegory of the present day situation in Middle Eastern and Western politics. In Jerusalem, you have the warmongering, religious zealots in red and the moderate, indecisive pacifists in blue. In the Muslim camp you have a similar dynamic between zealotry and moderation. In neither case is the allegory historically accurate, but that doesn't prevent it from being appropriate and thought provoking.To summarize, Kingdom of Heaven is an extremely beautiful and entertaining movie. I have seen the film maybe half a dozen times and it is still just as entertaining as the first time. I would recommend this film to anyone without hesitation.",Kingdom of Heaven

And somehow many of the shots of battle and landscape scenes was close to something you've seen in ""Lord of the Rings"", which makes the feel of the movie better in my mind. Some of the battles may even have been taken from ""Lotr"" and some are better, but some are just the same. What really surprised me is what Ridley Scott pulled out of Orlando Bloom, he actually got him to act pretty well, considering the previous films I've seen with Mr. Bloom. He gives a pretty solid performance. And so does many of the other actors, but no doubt Orlando is the main character in this film, everybody else comes and goes, almost. It's a solid combination of action drama and epic material. And I like it.Story: The story evolves around the household of Ibelin, a well positioned family in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, near the end of the second crusade. The story takes it's characters from actually persons, with Balian of Ibelin, Sibylla, King Baldwin IV, Saladin(leader of the Arabs), Raynald of Chatillon and Guy of Lusignan, characters who all have lived and had an essential role in the crusades. Bloom is Balian, the most fictionalized of the ""real"" characters. He's a blacksmith who's lost his son, and after that his wife committed suicide, therefor when Balians father asked Balian to join the crusades, Balian accepted to claim his wife's soul from hell. Balian becomes baron of Ibelin and by what little training he had by his father becomes a great knight and a close ally of the king. Soon he becomes a part of the fight for the crown, in which Raynald and Guy are the bad guys, and while this, Saladin stands ready to reclaim Jerusalem. All this is pretty much true from the history books. And the story is definitely exciting, caught me, but as the story gets more complex we instead focus on the battles. But it all gets through, and the story actually goes where we like it to go, a few loose ends in the end, but nothing we actually need!The cast is an all star cast, or anyway like we see in many Ridley Scott films, a good number of stars, famous and solid actors. And they perform as one would expect! (my favorite was actually Mr. Edward Norton, he came very strongly through, but still not as Edward Norton). Orlando Bloom was a positive surprise for me, and Brenda Gleeson was absolutely devilish!**The Spoilers**As said many battles scenes where similar to those of ""LOTR"", same shooting style, same angles, very similar settings and scenarios. Not a bad thing, but for instance when Balian is protecting the people outside the city gates of Kerak, the way they ride towards the Arabs army, was shot exactly like Faramir's Siege of Osgilitah, it's the same impossible mission and same speed and angles. Of one can argue that is the way it was done in the time, and Peter Jackson has used those things in his battles, but too many things are too close. But the shots was at points actually better than in ""LOTR"", so some good things came of it. A funny thing actually came to my mind, Jerusalem's lay-out is close to Minas Tirith's, and Tolkien being religious and loving history, most have known the plan of the divine city and known the quest to make a new one of those, by Romans as well as colonists, there is good argument for the similarities of Jersusalem and Minas Torith. After seeing the film, i was intrigued by the story, and found Wikipedia.com, and searched for Balian, King Baldwin and company. And i loved that it was all based on characters and battles of history. Although was disappointed to find that Balian and Sibylla was the characters to have had the largest make-over. Balian was of the rich ambitious family, had three brothers, born in the middle-east, although brave, not as large front runner in the stopping the crusades, although he in fact did negotiate the surrender of Jerusalem. And that he actually helped the mad Richard Lionheart on the third crusade. Raynald i was glad to see was very true to history, and love that the scene of his beheading was taken from an Arabian historic source. Great Fun. For me it's a thrill when the make a pretty accurate movie of a story, and this is a good insight to how the second crusade actually ended. **Spoilers have ended** I'll give it an eighter for the cast, the battle, the settings, the good historic base, and for the joy of seeing an epic like this again. Although I will reserve the right to change it to a seven, if i see it again, but can't imagine that!Enjoy the movie!",Kingdom of Heaven
283,sebbezw,"this is supposed to be epic, right?",5,20 January 2006,"This movie suffers from a serious speed problem. To damn high tempo in the beginning, to slow in the end. Let me then guess that Ridley Scott wanted this to be a movie were things happens all the time, but then he could do the (almost) compulsory thing that makes such great movies as Lord of the Rings and Braveheart* earn the title ""epic"", procrastinate everything to the maximum. That's exactly what he does in the end, but in the beginning, everything happens so fast that it make it seem like a b-movie. Of course, it isn't. But still, I cant possible like more than I already do. Which give a confirming that I don't like it. This movie also contains a thing which could make you doubt when it comes to Orlando Bloom, but after all, he didn't write the script. At the end, when the ""grandiose"" battle takes place, it reveals some rip-offs from Lord of the Rings, which makes you laugh. I would never see the this movie again. Well, not voluntary of course.* Don't get me wrong on that. No doubt Braveheart is epic, but I still don't like it",Kingdom of Heaven

285,owlglass,Ridlay Scott has done it again,10,8 May 2005,"Yes, there is a certain predictability about Ridley Scott's movies, and particularly his 'epic' ones. But it's a good kind of predictability, if you know what I mean. Ridley Scott's 'war' epics 1492: Conquest of Paradise, Black Hawk Down, Gladiator, and now Kingdom of Heaven (and even, one might argue, The Duellists and Alien)are all about the lives, decisions and actions of individuals within the context of war, conquest, religion and 'empire'. This background is significant, because it gives all of them a strong 'political' dimension and highlights the ethical conflicts and paradoxes arising from this juxtaposition of 'individual' and large-scale social events. In Kingdom of Heaven, Scott makes these issues more explicit than ever before; therefore this may be his most 'political' movie ever. The problem with such movies is that polemics and ideological proselytizing tends to so overwhelm the 'show don't tell' rule that should govern good story-telling; as evidenced by the work of, for example, Oliver Stone. Not so with Scott. Kingdom of Heaven is a rousing, yet thoughtful, tale, with a story-thread straight out of Hero With A Thousand Faces, set against the background of the ever-controversial Crusades. His messages are clear enough: people believe different things and they will act as if the contents of those beliefs were 'true', thus often bringing them into conflict with others who believe differently; all human affairs are conducted by fallible individuals; true nobility, such as that idealized in the figure of the 'knight', is found in compassion and service (""...without fear in the face of your enemies. Safeguard the helpless, even if it leads to your death; that is your oath."")The message will be derided by the sophisticates and cynics of the world, but Scott can afford to ignore them. Besides, it is more profound than anything they can come up with; for ultimately it is one of tolerance and acceptance of the basic parameters of that thing known as 'human nature'. It is difficult to even see him label anybody as truly 'evil', though he makes it clear that the world would definitely better without some kinds of people.As far as 'epics' are concerned, I find it hard to conceive of anything announced for 2005 that could beat hit as 'epic of the year'.

286,conmech,"The Greatest ""War"" Movie By Far...",10,9 January 2008,"I never imagined there would be a movie with better war scenes than ""LotR  Return of the King"", but there it is. Kingdon of Heaven is a prefect movie in every aspect. It came out at a wrong time, when I was choked under the mountain of war movies, but it truly showed its superiority over the others. I always knew Riddley Scott was a good director, but with this movie he proved everyone what he's capable of. I really believe he'll be a legend director in the future like Steven Spielberg.What I love about Riddley Scott is, all the way from ""Blade Runner"", he makes big scenes, and works a lot doing them. He thinks a lot wider than just the screen, which many directors can't do. I love how he builds whole cities, like in Gladiator, Blade Runner, Alien, or this movie. You get fascinated by how much work he has put in a single scene.The war scenes are incredible. I've seen A lot of war scenes, and I couldn't help but say ""wow!"" every 2 minutes. The biggest superiority of the war scenes were they were shot at very wide angles so you have to make the stunts actually battle with each other, unlike the movies like ""300"" where u see 2-3 people per scene. He must have gone crazy trying to coordinate all those horsemen and fighters.And last of all, I love how he reached the idea of war, crusades, and religion. As a Muslim I deeply respect him, and know it very well that wars are not caused by evil nations, but by evil people in the nations. This fact still counts today. I heard this movie outraged a part of the Christians (probably the same part who enjoy making insulting cartoons of Hz. Mohammad), so suck it up haters, Ridley Scott is the man!",Kingdom of Heaven
287,LordBlacklist,Director's cut is the only cut,10,17 June 2006,"When I first saw this film in may of 2005 I had read all the stories about extensive cutting, and outright deletion of scenes. I was hesitant to even see this film in the theater because why bother? It is not the true version. My curiosity eventually got the better of me and I went to the early show. I have to admit it was one of the more frustrating filmgoing experiences I have ever had. Nothing seemed to be payed off...events were haphazardly rushed through, depth of character was obviously missing. The most painful thing about Kingdom of Heaven (the theatrical cut) was that is was so obvious that it was a great film that had been butchered into a ""studio approved version."" What more would I expect from Fox, the most creatively stifling, money grubbing studio of the new millennium. The theatrical version was a film cut into something it was not meant to be (much like Ridley Scott's Legend). Is this film an epic? Yes. Does it have battles? Of course. Is that all that the film is about? Absolutely not.For over a year I had been waiting for the director's cut to come to theaters (it came to ONE screen in Fairfax for 2 weeks...nice job, Fox)or DVD. When I finally got the DVD and I was absolutely unprepared for the beauty and grandeur of a film the film that deserved to be seen in theaters as it was intended. There is simply no excuse for what Fox did, even if they did not do it directly (Ridley's reasoning: ""If you don't cut it they will cut it for you"") The Director's cut of film is an absolute masterpiece, one of the greatest films of our time and easily would have been the best picture of last year had the director's cut been the version that was ultimately released. Every character, plot, sub-plot, action sequence, and scene of dialogue takes on so much more meaning in this new cut that it feels like an entirely different film. Every aspect of Kingdom of Heaven is of the absolute highest quality. Ther performances, the writing, the music (Gregson-William's score was the best score of 2005, but just like the film, it got no recognition). Ridley Scott is perhaps the greatest working director alive today, more so than Spielberg, or Cameron because he is one of the few true artists of the cinematic form. A Ridley Scott film is like a great work of art that can be observed many times with new meanings being taken from them with each viewing. With Kingdom of Heaven: The Director's Cut, it is a bittersweet triumph that one of his greatest masterpieces has finally seen the light of day, but it should have been the version that was released to theaters in the first place. See the Director's Cut, it is one of the greatest films you will ever see in an age that produces few that are even memorable",Kingdom of Heaven
288,shafatqadri,Balanced Approach!!!! Just Short of being a masterpiece,7,19 March 2008,"Jerusalem is a holy city for three major religions: Chirstianity, Islaam and Judism. For some two centuries, Christians and Muslims fought to lay exclusive claim to this holy land during the period known as the Crusades. Others looked at the bigger world picture and decided to defend the city for all. ""Kingdom Of Heaven"" is a look at a part of the battle for Jerusalem that is set about halfway through that historical conflict.I liked the movie instantaneously partly because Ridley Scott (Gladiator/Black Hawk Down/Hannibal) being my one of the fav directors and partly because the movie showed a balanced approach when dealing with Muslim-Chirstian conflict, though there was a controversy regarding the movie in the western world regarding this. During a period when tensions are high (for obvious reasons) between Muslims and Christians, I'm surprised Ridley Scott ever got the backing to produce a film like this.The film begins in France, where Balian (Orlando Bloom) has just buried his wife, a suicide who the local priests have conveniently condemned to an eternity in hell. One day, an old knight Godfrey (Liam Neeson) pays him a visit, explaining to him that he's his father and asks him to accompany him back to Palestine, promising wealth and religious glory. Balian is not exactly enthusiastic, but after a local priest explains to him that should he find glory as a crusader he can take his wife's place in hell, he decides to take up Godfrey's offer.After a perilous journey, Balian discovers that Jerusalem is a city thriving under an uneasy peace. The Christian state promotes tolerance among the religious factions, Muslims and Jews. Ruling over the peace is the prodigious King Baldwin (Edward Norton), vital but slowly dying of leprosy. Enforcing his will is the deeply pragmatic Tiberias (Jeremy Irons), a politician interested in maintaining the peace in Jerusalem, even if it means hanging unruly Christian knights who routinely harass the Muslim caravans. Standing against the court's wishes are the Knights Templar, led by the arrogant Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas) and the murderous religious fanatic, Reynald (Brendan Gleeson), hungry to expand their feudal holdings and itching for a war against the Muslims.The Kingdom is now threatened by the powerful, ambitious and brilliant ruler of Egypt, Salahuddin al-Ayubi or often spelled as Saladin, played by Syrian actor Ghassan Masood. Now what I find most striking about the film is that it portrays the Muslims, especially Salahuddin, as more of the good guy. It should also be pointed out that there's a rather politically correct feel to the story with neither Christians or Muslims being portrayed as out and out villains with only the Knight templars being portrayed as evil. Jerusalem was always a much more tolerant city of all faiths when in Muslim control, at least before the events that take place in this film. If you are even slightly a history buff, it'll make you want to go read up on the Crusades and Salahuddin.Near the conclusion of KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, Balian concedes Jerusalem to Salahuddin after days of relentless attack and Salahuddin gave a safe passage to all Chirstians who wanted to leave. ""What is Jerusalem worth?"" Balian asks his Muslim vanquisher. ""Nothing,"" Salahuddin replies first. Walking away and then turning back to Balian and pointing towards himself he says: ""Everything."" Such an ambiguous response cuts to the heart of the futility of war Ridley Scott has crafted so expertly, with the safe, liberal hindsight of bygone centuries regrettably returning to a modern Holy Land still under siege.Kingdom of Heaven doesn't quite have the power of Gladiator but I still think that Ridley's done a bang up job on this movie. In short this is a film that is sometimes beautiful and stunning but often irritating , confused and plodding . It is well directed and acted (except Orlando Bloom as Balian) but you often get the impression that it tries too hard and this works against it.",Kingdom of Heaven

And I wasn't disappointed. Amazing cinematography and art direction. Stunning and symbolic visuals in the story line itself and the battle scenes. And speaking as a Lord of the Rings fan, the main battle sequence at Jerusalem is the equal of the siege of Minas Tirith in Return of the King. This is more of an ensemble piece than Gladiator was, so anyone who has issues with Orlando Bloom, he just about disappears for about thirty minutes in the middle of the movie, however, Bloom totally comes into his own as an actor by the end of the film. Bloom also does a wonderful job at the beginning of the movie communicating without actually speaking. Speaking as a Christian, I found it a beautiful film with beautiful performances from EVERY member of its cast. It is more than worth seeing.",Kingdom of Heaven
290,say_andy,"Unless sword-fighting epics are your thing, don't see this movie.",4,18 May 2005,"Sadly, my initial instincts about the movie proved to be true. It seems as though director Ridley Scott really wanted to do a Crusades movie, and set out do so. He had some big ideas of battle scenes, some ideas of bravery, and an agenda about the validity of religious warfare (and religion in general). What he didn't have, sadly, is a story.Which pretty much made everything else in the film a pointless exercise. The characters are empty and lifeless, the plot is near non-existent, and the drama is entirely dependent on how easily you get wrapped up in sword fights. I did not care for a single character on the screen, so whether or not they lived or died, succeeded or failed, loved or lost all meant nothing to me. What little story there is in the movie is loosely pieced together in a rushed attempt to get us from one overwrought battle sequence to another. For much of the movie, I felt like there was some preparatory reading I supposed to do before that movie that would have filled me in on the missing pieces.What little plot there is revolves around coincidences so unbelievably convenient that it becomes hard to take the rest of the film seriously, even though it painfully wishes to be taken seriously. The star of the film, Orlando Bloom plays a grieving blacksmith at the beginning of the movie that barely knows how to hold a sword or speak out loud. By the end, even though it appears as though merely a year has passed, he becomes the greatest military mind the Holy Land has ever seen, and the a leader with the combined oratory skills and charisma of Patton and Jesus Christ. Which isn't even the most unbelievable part of the film. That would be when the boat taking Bloom to Jerusalem capsizes and washes up on shore, and everyone aboard except he and one horse dies. He seems to escape unharmed. Maybe, he's Unbreakable. But, I will give Bloom this: he wears facial hair in the movie, which I guess proves that he is indeed a male of the species. I bet it's fake.Since the only purpose for the existence of this movie seems to be to show Crusades-type fighting, I will admit that many of the battle scenes were technically impressive. In particular, the depiction of the siege of Jerusalem was fairly well done, with the exception of the CGI'd Muslim army, which was a bit overdone, making it appear to be an army of roughly 5 million. This seems to be a particular fetish of recent movies, portraying impossibly large armies on film in an attempt to blow the viewer's minds. Anyway, given credit to some of the visual strength of the film, I give it 4 out of 10 stars. Unless sword-fighting epics are your thing, don't see this movie. You probably won't hate it if you see it, but you aren't missing anything if you skip it.",Kingdom of Heaven

As I learned afterwards the movie was designed to last around 3 hours but the studio assumed the public wont have the patience for it and made Ridley Scott shorten it, taking out 40 mins worth of bits and pieces out to make it more accessible. That made the whole film feel incomplete, incoherent, frustrating. The full movie released as the directors cut has a completely different flow and depth - it is beautiful, poetic and a joy to immerse in, it would deserve 9 stars. It is known to be the most different version of a movie ever released in a directors cut, so do yourself the favor of watching that one.",Kingdom of Heaven
292,headtrauma420,"Terrible! A total waste of film, time and money.",3,12 July 2005,"I honestly cannot believe that this movie got such good reviews! Is the movie going public losing brain power? First of all, I had a feeling that this movie was going to be bad. The only reason I went to see it was because a friend of mine (who repeatedly goes to terrible movies)dragged me to it. I decided that since I hadn't seen a Hollywood movie in a while, so I thought, well, if nothing else maybe I'll get a good laugh at it. Ten minutes into the movie, I was squirming in my seat and heckling the movie. Here are the simple facts as to why this movie sucks: - Orlando Bloom is not capable of carrying an entire movie, he's NOT a good actor. - Eva Green had too small a part. If anyone could have carried this movie it was her. - The cinematography and editing were terrible. I saw too many lens flares, blown out frames, color mis-matches and bad cutting for me to ignore. I am a filmmaker, but still, I believe that it is a filmmakers duty to make the best picture you're capable of making. - The script was definitely the worst thing about it because, if you have a bad script, there is nothing you can do to save it. It was full of holes and poorly constructed almost to the point of being confusing (if it weren't already so boring). - Finally, there was absolutely nothing original about the things that could have been original: I.E. costumes, battle scenes, character traits... the list goes on.Overall, I would say that this movie is a complete and udder waste of time, money, and the film it's printed on.

293,zeemaza,"Huge production, bad movie.",5,19 May 2005,"First of all I would like to say that I am Muslim. Having said that I must stress on the fact that we take our religion more seriously than most people care to understand;therefore, why have the men pray with a distance of a few feet between them? then when they are praying next to each other why are they praying while the call for the prayer is still going on? Really, try to understand that this really spoils things for us.Now: Orlando Bloom is a boy lacking charisma. Get a man for God's sake. And explain this to me: if he was going to Jerusalem to seek God's forgiveness for both his wife and himself, then how can one of the first things he does, when he gets there, is to sleep with the princess who happens to be someone's wife. And shouldn't that relationship have been a little, teeny weeny, bit more secretive? I mean how can she stand there in front of his and her entourages and say her farewell and kiss his ... whatever, I really don't know what she kissed, after they had their role in the hay. She's a king's sister and a knight's wife. Is there some kind of double standard there or is it just me because I happen to be Muslim? In our religion this happens to be a huge sin.... oh well.And I believe that if Salahuddin is one of the parties in this epic struggle then his foe should be a King. I believe that what went on between Richard the Lionheart, King of England and Salahuddin would have made a much richer story.The film goes on for so long with no real event. You wait and wait and wait for a Ridley Scott battle, which I cherish (I believe he is the master of film and the best Director ever, even after this film), then... oh no... no battle. Once is OK but by the second time I'm starting to yawn.Oh, and when the battles finally do arrive... will someone tell me who wrote that speech? really.... boring!!!Another thing: when there were words of wisdom to be said, they lacked depth... and wisdom!!! Someone was trying too hard and ended up sounding lame.Last of all, Salahuddin would never pick black as his color of dress. It is Shi'ite and he was Sunni... but I don't think it would really matter. But it would be like if I portrayed the Catholic Pope wearing the traditional Greek Orthodox Pope's garments. Oh well... why am I getting so picky I shall never know. And if asked what Jerusalem meant to him, Salahuddin would never say ""nothing,"" and then go on to amusingly say ""and everything.""I do give the film this: wonderful landscape shots, costumes and graphics. I still like Scott though. But next time if you want a hero, please get a real man.",Kingdom of Heaven
294,Sabriane,Just short of pure cinematic heaven,7,17 May 2005,"As someone else already remarked, Kingdom of Heaven is full of weaknesses but is held together by its strengths. The biggest weakness, I'm sorry to say, has to do with - surprise surprise - Orlando Bloom in the leading role of Balian. I've nothing against the guy and I really enjoyed his supporting performances in LoTR movies, but he just doesn't have the ""it"" factor to pull of a Russell Crowe star-making turn, at least not in this type of film. Despite the beard, the grime and the extra pounds he supposedly packed for his role, he's still too wispy, too polished and pretty to convince as either blacksmith or a medieval knight, especially with rugged masculine warhorses like Liam Neeson around him. But mostly I think it has to do with the sheer lack of presence and gravitas. Bloom doesn't fare too badly when, for the first two-third or so, he's surrounded with strong, seasoned actors who can make so much out of so little. But when the climatic siege of Jerusalem comes and most of the compelling characters have either died or left, it's up to Bloom to carry the film on his slender shoulders and he fails miserably. Balian's big rallying speech has all the intensity of a mouse squeak and when he and Saladin ""trade the stares"" over the battlefield the exchange is so one-sided it's laughable. Ed Norton's king - an ailing leper who can barely walk - is about ten times as imposing.Bloom's effort apart, I just didn't find Balian a terribly compelling character and there was one particular moment when I felt like seriously slapping the guy. Knowing that his days are numbered, King Baldwin offers Balian a chance to marry his sister and keep the peace in Jerusalem, which Balian refuses because, an honourable knight that he is, he can't be the cause of death of the villainous Guy de Lusignan. I guess cavorting around with his wife doesn't trouble Balian's conscience too much. I can see where his refusal comes from, but it really irks me that he doesn't even seem to consider the implications of his decision outside of himself. Yeah, thousands of people will die, but at least -I- will go to bed with clear conscience and since I'm the hero of the film that's what matters the most. Gimme a break.Much has been made of the film forcing 21-century viewpoints on medieval characters and sanitising one of the darkest and most brutal times in human history. The way I see it, it would be a nearly-impossible feat to present these events, people and their sensibilities ""as they were"" while still keeping them palatable to a modern viewer, so I'm not too fussed about omitting facts and mucking around with characters' world views. But IMO where the film really goes overboard is with the depiction of Christianity; it's got not one but *two* cartoonish boo-hiss priests who all but wear ""we're two-faced hypocrites"" sign on them. And while the intention to treat both sides sympathetically is theoretically laudable, it does sap the film of real tension and drama.The strengths? The stunning, elegant cinematography, the costumes, the weaponry, Ridley Scott's direction which is masterful and detailed as always. The sight of huge armies facing off each other might not be anything new after LoTR, Troy, Alexander etc., but it's still an eye-grabbing spectacle, as is the siege of Jerusalem. I did have a few Minas Tirith/Helm's Deep flashbacks on the way, but it's also got its own tricks and twists on medieval warfare.The supporting cast is a dream and should be credited for sustaining my interest throughout the film. It's chock full of memorable characters even if they appear on screen for a few minutes or so. Liam Neeson may be playing yet another mentor role, but I'd watch him at it twenty times over and never be bored. Eva Green doesn't have much to do, but her Sybilla has a compelling, haunting presence beyond a mere requisite love interest. Jeremy Irons as Tiberias does his thing with that wonderful voice of his; Ghassan Massoud is both fearsome and dignified as Saladin. I could easily believe that here was a warrior who'd reduce his enemies to jelly just by giving them a look. Edward Norton though out acts everyone else from behind a silver mask and his King Baldwin is the film's most striking and affecting character despite him being on screen for maybe 10 minutes in total. This gentle-voiced leper has genuine majesty and sadness about him; his confrontations with Saladin and Reynald and the scene with his sister were the film's dramatic high points for me. If an extended cut is ever to be released, I hope to see more of him... heck I'd watch a whole movie about him.",Kingdom of Heaven
295,godamndevil1977,What is Jerusalem worth?,8,15 November 2005,"At first I was apprehensive about wasting 138 minutes on Kingdom Of Heaven. Looking at Orlando Bloom on the cover - I wasn't 100% he could fill that medi-warrior esq role, the likes of Russell Crowe & Mel Gibson pulled off very well.But to the point, it is a superb film, as wacky as it sounds it is almost like Gladiator meets Braveheart.Orlando as young as he is, does a convincing job, unlike Maximus in Gladiator he isn't just a pure killing machine. Ridley Scott plays on Orlando's youth and lesser macho physique, and the result is his character only scrapes thru his battles and fights instead of slaying them in a blink of an eye.The photography, locations & other characters all tie up well..some neat ideas in the backdrops, there's also an excellent shipwreck scene which supports the opinion that Ridley Scott is one of the most creative mainstream directors out there.Balian's (Bloom) journey seems pretty encompassing and complete, yet the point of the story (Europe vs The Middle East) doesn't really hit the film til the last quarter, this is the edge-of-your-seat stuff that really blows you away..My only gripes are; some of Balian's speeches are a bit lousy, and Nathalie Cox and Liam Neeson's roles could have been expanded on..Otherwise if you have not already seen this - do so!",Kingdom of Heaven

The problem with KoH is not exactly the lack of story, but the fact that they tried to put TOO much story in a movie that's just too short. Making the time-line in the film incoherent and improbable. After Troy, Alexander and KoH...Hollywood is trying HARD to make epic movies. But they must learn from the Star wars Saga and LOTR trilogy...that you can't squeeze an epic story/saga into a 2 or even 3 hour movie.They keep trying to squeeze their epic stories into a relatively short time, that a new Hollywood myth is born. The short siege. From Lotr to Troy.Short sieges has become commonplace. The siege of troy that lasted for years was shrunk into what felt like a few weeks at most. And the siege for Jerusalem also felt surprisingly short. It felt just days instead of months and years.Please don't misunderstand me, I am not complaining that the movie should be authentic and realistic. I am just saying that a movie is about telling a story...and with the current run of epic movies. The story is taking a backseat to the sights,action and CGI. And I think that's shameful. Why not make the movie simpler, but tell the whole story.In the end I must say that the way Peter Jackson has setup the LOTR trilogy is a truly incredible piece of art.",Kingdom of Heaven
297,DerSongsurfer,Better than expected!,7,29 December 2006,"When by coincidence I came to see this movie I had low expectations, this being an American production about a historical and very difficult content I thought this to be a real piece of trash (And I mean it in the most negative way!) But the more of the plot revealed the less prejudices I found to be fulfilled. Being historically rather accurate on the one hand showing all the cruelty of the Templers and the destruction they produced and on the other hand presenting an interesting story with a huge part of action, this film can be regarded as intelligently made and quite worthwhile.Moreover, Orlando Bloom, amongst many other great actors as Eva Green, gave an unexpected wonderful performance.",Kingdom of Heaven
298,yakikorosu,Impressive visuals but poor script and uneven acting,6,18 May 2005,"I can't help but think that Ridley Scott got in a wee bit over his head when he got it in his mind to creature a picture that satisfies as both a Gladiator-esquire tale of gritty ancient combat, a Lord of the Rings-style war epic AND an intellectual commentary on religion and fanaticism.But let's start with the good points. The visuals are at times sumptuous. Seeing two huge armies come face to face, particularly the Crusader army with their gigantic golden cross, sent a little thrill through me. The mandatory 'big battle' at the end is relatively impressive too, although it would have been far more so if Peter Jackson hadn't already done it much better in The Two Towers.Some of the acting (Liam Neeson, Jeremy Irons, Edward Norton and Ghassan Massoud in particular) is spot-on, and captures well the feel that this movie should have held on to--a battle, albeit for contrived reasons, between valorous, if brutal, men. Norton (as the Christian king) and Massoud (as Saladin) come off as the real stars of the show--two starkly different but equally fascinating characters trying to balance honor and expediency in the face of all out war. Unfortunately, both get little screen time.Instead, we get the angel-faced Orlando Bloom as Balian, a pretentiously moralistic blacksmith-turned-knight who is convinced that his ideals trump reality. Yet oddly enough, he cannot seem to decide what those ideals are--his character shows little if any consistency, much less development, and his actions seem random and arbitrary, like he simply takes parts in a series of separate ""skits"" (Balian at court, Balian in battle, Balian the thinker, Balian the farmer). Bloom has no screen presence of any kind, and consequently Balian is overshadowed by pretty much the entire supporting cast; a mouse among powerful men. Just as Balian is impossible to like, his ""enemies,"" fanatical Christians bent on killing Muslims, seem cartoony and contrived. They don't even have the cheesy insanity that Scott captured so well with Commodus in Gladiator--at least HE was easy to dislike! Equally tacked on is a romantic subplot involving Bloom.The movie's worst problem, however, is a shoddy and threadbare script. This is hardly a compact film, at almost two and a half hours, yet it still feels hurried, rolling at a frenzied pace through a confusing succession of scenes very few of which seem relevant to the direction the story ends up going, which leaves you asking ""What was the point of THAT?"" A cheesy script can be forgiven though. Gladiator worked without a particularly strong script (although it was still better than this one) because it stayed true to the basis: a tough, likable character whose violent revenge you can root for because the bad guys deserve it. Bloom, about as macho as my grandmother, is simply too prissy and moralistic to take seriously as the war hero Scott wants us to believe he is. In the end, the film is boring not because nothing happens--far from it, things are happening all the time--but because the filmmakers simply give you no reason to CARE about what happens.",Kingdom of Heaven
299,LightningB,Thanks goodness for the director's cut.,8,20 July 2020,"I saw this back when it came out in theaters and I remember walking out feeling ""Meh"". Wasn't terrible but it was certainly nothing special. And moved on with no intention of seeing it again and certainly never owning it on DVD or Blu-ray.When I heard the directors cut was coming and that it was much better I actually went ahead and bought it without seeing it. And after seeing it I was like ""Holy crap that was way better!"" And I mean way better. Chalk another one up to the studio for screwing up the theatrical release. It was marketed so terrible. Poor Ridley Scott seems to get screwed over by studios much more than any other director.I think the theatrical release was maybe a 4. A 5 at best. Right now I'm giving the directors cut an 8 but I debated giving it a 9. All the characters are way better (more interesting) and there's much more to the story that adds to the overall experience and is just a superior version. Not even close.",Kingdom of Heaven
300,johndavidson-1,Director's Cut - a true epic - every bit equal to Gladiator,10,6 January 2007,"Having seen the theatrical edition at the cinema I was disappointed; the characters lacked depth and things seemed to happen too often via 'move logic' where the plot swamped the story. I should have had more faith in Ridley Scott and the Director's Cut clearly demonstrates that the characterisation and motivation was in there, it was just cut out for length. At 45 minutes of extra footage, this version does not contain an ounce of fat; every scene adds to the story, making sense of events in a character driven rather dumbed down and explained sort of way. Orlando Bloom was something of a weak link in the theatrical release. Without the additional character moments he lacked the on screen charisma to sell the idea of a simple blacksmith(who was in fact a former soldier and engineer) becoming a major player in Jerusalem in 1187. The additional script gives him the boost he needs and takes some of that weight off his shoulders. By the end of the movie you are on his side and can understand why he makes the choices he makes. The main winner on the story stakes is Sybilla- Princess of Jerusalem (Eva Green) as she gets significant additional screen time and a real story that helps explain both the politics and the personal tragedy that motivates her decisions in the final act.The pace of the story remains excellent, the set pieces are exciting and the battles bloody and vicious. This is a Ridley Scott film after all. This re-cut has elevated the movie from a mediocre action adventure into a full blown historical epic.",Kingdom of Heaven
301,BodyDoubleFilms,Astonishingly Bad,1,17 May 2005,"I thought Gladiator was bad. Never did I dream R Scott could go further. This has to be a contender for the greatest movie anti-climax ever created. R Scott confirms he either has a complete lack of understanding of history, or he just doesn't care whether his epics make any kind of logical sense. He manages to take fascinating periods of history and turn them into simplistic fairy tales. The story of Robin Hood has more historical accuracy than this.What happened to ""show don't tell""? Characters are constantly telling each other supposedly deep and meaningful things, without any kind of demonstration.Any meaning there might be in the script is destroyed by Orlando Bloom's performance, which is as flat as a pancake. I just couldn't care less about his character. I couldn't care less about any of the characters. Even with some decent actors doing their best with wafer thin material.And having sat through two hours of irrelevant talking, and a few spectacular moments during the battle for Jerusalem, the ending is astoundingly absurd. Beyond even laughter.To think of the millions upon millions wasted on this idiotic tripe.None of it makes sense. None of it has any meaning. None of it has any sense of reality.Yes, it looks pretty enough. But it's like sitting through a 2 1/2 hour TV ad.Don't even bother going for the battle scenes, which form only a minor part of this festival of low-grade dialogue.",Kingdom of Heaven
302,hiproductions,"Convoluted story, poor cinematography: Good performances",4,3 June 2005,"To sound as flipfloppy as possible: I didn't love this movie but I didn't hate it either. The story was a bit convoluted. Why in the crap was Liam Neesan wandering in Europe? to find his son? why all of a sudden? And what did the Orlando Bloom character want? What did the princess/queen lady with the bad mascara job want? I couldn't make heads or tails of the plot. All I could figure out from this movie was what I brought with me to the theater: a basic knowledge of history. From that I surmised that they wanted to establish a ""New World Order/U.N. Peacekeeping mission"" for Jerusalem where everyone just 'gets along' etc. aside from the evil Christian vs. the 'sensitive' Muslim undertones, the story was not very compelling. As for the cinematography, God help us all. I can't believe this is the same guy that shot ""Gladiator"" I thought maybe everybody was dark half the time and focus was infinitely deep the other half of the time because of the format, then I discovered it was shot in super 35...no excuses there. I was constantly distracted from the convoluted story by poor cinematography. I just couldn't see the actors. Some of the opening shots looked like something from an early Sergio Leone western...which isn't a compliment. The one bright spot here are the performances by Bloom and Neesan. Both are excellent actors, Ridley Scott is an excellent director this should inevitably lead to quality performances. It was these performances that kept me in the theater and will probably cause me to rent the DVD to see if on a second viewing, I can pick up pieces I may have lost in the initial viewing.",Kingdom of Heaven

And Scott didn't disappoint me.The cinematography is breathtaking, and the combat scenes are gorgeous. The director, however, doesn't embellish violence. He rather focuses more on how painful and futile it is.I think this film criticizes the Iraq war. Like the line in the movie, the white people pretend that they are saviors, but what they really do is to rob the land and the properties from the Muslims for their own greed.That's why I felt so delightful when Sybilla's husband, which I think represent Bush, is captured and humiliated at the meaningless battle.What I love so much about this film is the main theme, peace and coexistence. That's what makes Ridelery Scott a great artist.Some conservative Christians and Americans might be affronted by this film. But you know what? The truth always hurts.",Kingdom of Heaven
304,janqb,Wonderfully Talented Cast -- Go See This Film on the Big Screen,8,8 May 2005,"I'm going to try and stay out of discussions about the religion aspects of the movie even though the movie is centered around religion.My thoughts on Bloom's role as Balian of Ibelin: I think Scott anticipated Bloom's acting inexperience at the outset of the film and decided to cast Liam Neeson and Jeremy Irons in prominent roles up to the middle of the story. This took some pressure off of Bloom's performance and the audience was focused on Godfrey and Tiberias, who carry the plot along. That was a smart move. Once Tiberius departs the spotlight truly focuses on Bloom, who by now has gotten more coaching from the director. Though Bloom's character is not entirely convincing at the start of the film, he is at the end. It was in the scene where Jerusalem comes under attack by Saladin's forces and Balian declares to the men that if they should fail, their wives and children will die that Bloom gives a convincing performance. When the fortress wall crumbles Balian manifests an inspiring conviction urging everyone to fight for what is right. It was at that moment that I realized Scott had casted the perfect actor for the part of Balian of Ibelin.In other reviews, Balian has been compared to Russell Crowe (Maximus) in Gladiator. I think the reviewers are remiss in making this comparison. Maximus inspires the masses with acts of bravery and daring, but Balian is entrusted with protecting the lives of the people of Jerusalem. Crowe's Maximus is a fighter but Bloom's Balian is a protector. Balian embodies all the ideals of knighthood--integrity, charity, truthfulness, courage but with the added responsibility of safeguarding the people. I don't think Maximus could ever have inspired ordinary people to pick up weapons and sacrifice their lives for a cause but Balian did. And Bloom embodies Balian perfectly. Though the acting was occasionally awkward--yes, the rallying cry of ""come on!"" was pretty lame--Bloom still delivers a fine performance as a catalyst fueling a cause much bigger than himself.And to the reviewer who complained about the hypocritical theologizing and lack of morality on Balian's part--there is a difference between rigidly following religious edicts and behaving with simple human compassion. Having sex with another man's wife is different from marrying her, taking over his future kingdom, and seeing him executed, which Balian refused to do. I don't think Scott intended Balian to be some kind of traditionalist who adheres to strict religious guidelines. The way that Balian fought and won the safety of the people of Jerusalem was completely chaotic. Balian is a revolutionary and not someone who follows the rules, he believes in doing what is right but on his own terms. Hence the appeal of this character.However, the award goes to Edward Norton for his portrayal of King Baldwin who is afflicted with leprosy. I never knew Norton could play such a convincing leprotic king! Overall, Ridley's Scott's film has a wondefully talented cast and in spite of the similarities to the Lord of the Rings movies (Ridley's just milking a money-making trend), I enjoyed myself immensely. Definitely see this film at the theater, don't wait for the DVD.",Kingdom of Heaven

On the bad side - he's the only interesting character who doesn't die. Everybody else on the side of the Christians I, and my gf, loathed and duly took the mick out of throughout the movie.By the end I was willing the Muslims on.There was a great movie struggling to get out, but where Gladiator soared and was greater than its flaws - this film falls painfully short.",Kingdom of Heaven

Orlando Bloom thankfully looks more like a man in this movie, and his acting has improved. I was disappointed in Liam Neeson's performance as Orlando's father, I felt he was rather one dimensional and seemed to be making a cameo appearance. Jeremy Irons was very good, as was the supporting cast. Unfortunately, the movie lacked plot, meandering from place to place until it found direction about 1 hour and 40 minutes into the film.

Naturally, any Europeans who actually believe in Christ are portrayed as bloodthirsty, stupid morons, and no priest is shown who is not venal craven, and cowardly. As a Protestant, I normally don't worry overmuch about insulting portrayals of Catholic clergy, but a modest respect for common sense suggests that they may have been at least a few Godly men in their ranks.The Muslims of course, are possessed of great subtlety and charm. The ""good"" knights of course, are pretty much Hollywood liberals, dealing with their usual inchoate longings.SPOILER: Not to deny that The Muslim leader Saladin was truly remarkable talented, man, but the end of the siege of Jerusalem shows Saladin giving free passage to all the defenders, certainly a magnanimous gesture.What Ridley Scott and the scriptwriters fail to divulge, is the historical fact that only those who could pay a ransom were set free. The ransom was ten sovereigns for a man, five for a woman, and one for a child. Those who could not pay, about 14,000 in all, were sold into slavery. (Source: ""Chronicles of the Crusades"", edited by Elizabeth Hallam.) Historical facts can be SO embarrassing! I had very high hopes for this film, as I think a decent film about the Crusades is long overdue. Actually, I recommend that people should see this film. There are superb action scenes. Viewers should be warned that this film is three hours long, much of it devoted to setting the precise Hollywood liberal nuance, through ENDLESS talking scenes. I personally wasn't THAT bored, but do warn prospective viewers. But in the end unfortunately, this film is the usual Hollywood bashing of Christians who ACTUALLY believe.And, ALL FILM MAKERS LISTEN UP!

Im an atheist but know that it was the muslims that pushed the violence into Europe forcing the crusades.

309,ninja_superstar-1,Good message behind an average movie,6,6 May 2005,"_Kingdom of Heaven_ confronts religious extremism as the bane of all evil. Using the Crusades as a backdrop, Christianity and Islam square off nearly 1000 years ago just as the major religions of the world do today. Battles over Jerusalem and concerns about what the city means to the world have been at the center of much human suffering for centuries. The tone of the film is greatly enhanced because its main character isn't particularly religious, and the film dissuades the viewer from taking sides, creating no demonized enemy, but rather a mesh of human beings being humans. Thus, this film is a true epic about our actual lives and histories and not about those men of virtue and bravery and evil and cowardice who exist only as abstracted myth.Unfortunately, Orlando Bloom is cast in this film. He simply does not have the charisma to carry a movie as its star. He has only one or two expressions throughout the entire film, and he is completely surrounded by great actors who make him look silly. This drags the movie down for me, because he has a lot of screen time. I love the ideas behind the film, but I don't like it when I'm watching a film and just know that I'm watching an actor act. That's not acting. I believed the other actors were actually who they were cast as. I have yet to see a convincing performance by Bloom and cannot understand why he is so popular. At least someone like Keanu Reeves has charm despite his inability to act consistently.The romance is completely copied and pasted. Boring.In the end, the film is average to me. Maybe it's the subject matter. The film isn't really about the Crusades. It's about greed and land and maybe a little religion as an excuse to go to war. This is an old tale, but I will admit that the timeliness of the film is at least interesting.",Kingdom of Heaven
310,terrors89,"Too long, but really good, if you like history",7,7 May 2005,"I enjoyed this movie because of the attention to detail that the writer William Monahan and Director Ridley Scott brought to this movie. However, this attention to detail at times slowed the movie down to a painful crawl and it seemed like a 3 hour long movie even though its only 2 hours long. However, since it's an epic it is a worthy effort by Mr. Scott and his cast did a workman like job in delivering the story.This movie deals with the fall of Jerusalem to the Muslim army of Saladin around 1188 A.D. The movie starts in France where a blacksmith named Balian, played by Orlando Bloom (Pirates of the Caribbean) was morning the death of his wife who committed suicide. Because she committed suicide the local priest reminds Balian that she won't go to heaven. Baron Godfrey, played by Liam Neeson (Phantom Menace,) meets Balian and tells him that is his dad and offers to take him to Jerusalem to be groomed to be his replacement. Balian declines the offer, but when he kills the priest of his village for remarks about his dead wife, Balian joins Godfrey. However, Balian is hunted down by the villagers and he along with Godfrey and some of his men are forced to fight to defend Balian. During the fight Godfrey is mortally wounded and dies before getting Balain to Jerusalem. Before he dies Godfrey Knights Balian and he is now the owner of the Godfrey's land east of Jerusalem. Jumping to the climatic scene, Balian is left to defend Jerusalem after the Army led by Guy is wiped out by the Muslim army in the desert. The acting was OK, nobody stood out yet nobody did a bad job. The one character I enjoyed the most was Tiberius, played by Jeremy Irons (Being Julia.) His character was by far the toughest of the good guys and he was smart, albeit a little bit of a coward in the end. I am not quite sure if I can ever accept Orlando Bloom as an action hero. He was perfect for the Lord of the Rings movie as well as Pirates, yet in those he had a strong ensemble cast. I just don't know if he is the kind of actor that can carry an action movie.I liked what Ridley Scott did with the movie. However, it was too long at times. The opening act where we get Balian to Jerusalem was way to long. I liked that he showed how dangerous the travel was across the Mediterranean but adding everything together in the first act, just too long. His battle scenes were not original or creative, but not every movie has to bring something new to the genre. So what if the scenes were copies of Lord of the Rings, until that movie we hadn't seen anything on such a grand scale, let's enjoy it a little while. Writer William Moynahan did a great job of adding detail to the script, some of it being based on factual information, I am amazed that this is his first writing effort on the big screen.The one thing that made me really upset was the music. Epic movies need their own original music, but to borrow music from other movies takes away from the movie. On my own I heard music from the movie The 13th Warrior, by Jerry Goldsmith, and I heard somebody say that he heard music from the Gladiator in this. If you are going to spend money to make an epic, spend money on making the music right too.While you might need to bring a pillow to watch the movie, I still say it is worth watching in a movie theatre. The attention to detail that was brought to the movie, complimented by the acting makes for an enjoyable movie.",Kingdom of Heaven
311,dave_wlogan,"Visually brilliant, decent script but a bad star",7,17 July 2008,"I enjoyed this movie. I felt that each character had depth and some performances deserve special mention. Edward Norton is fantastic as King Baldwin. His performance completely outclassed Orlando Bloom and Eva Green was brilliant as his sister Sibylla. Jeremy Irons, Liam Nesson and Ghassan Massoud were great in their roles as Tiberias, Godfrey de Ibelin and Saladin. Marton Csokas also did a more than decent job when portraying the arrogant Guy de Lusignan and Brendan Gleeson did the same with the masochistic Reynald de Chatillon. Orlando Bloom is the only actor who lets the side down despite acting better than usual. The battle sequences are, as we expect after Gladiator, truly epic. The fight sequences are better than Braveheart and better yet violence is only shown when necessary. THere's a great scene where Reynald de Chatillon stands amongst the carnage he has created. This scene shows the destruction he can create and has no remorse for his actions. The dialogue continues from the previous scene:Guy de Lusignan Give me a war!Reynald de Chatillon That is what I do (cuts to aftermath of carnage) I am what I am. Someone has to be.This small segment is one of my favourite bits of the movie. It gives us an insight into Reynald's character by suggesting that he has to justify the killing to the audience. In a way he seems remorseful for being who is rather than for the actual killing.Religion is another important aspect of this film. The film suggests that religion originally fueled the Christian crusade but now it is just an excuse for the violence. Every time the Templars charge into a skirmish they cry ""God wills it!"" to justify their actions. Later a Saracen says the same thing when fighting with Saladin during the defeat of Guy de Lusignan. This suggests the religions are similar and that the Saracens will head down the same path as the Christians. KJing Baldwin and Saladin are both shown to have great understanding for each others beliefs, as well as great respect. King Baldwin always preaches sense over scripture, as does Saladin to a fanatical follower. Saladin put it best when he said : ""How many battles did God for us before I came, that is before God determined I should come?"" The religious aspect of this film is shown throughout the film as a recurring theme. Islam is only about twice shown in a negative light while the Christians are constantly shown as corrupt and violent men. Saladin acknowledges the similarity in the religions when he places a fallen crucifix back on the altar in a Jeurusilam church.A good effort by Scott, and the majority of the cast then.

313,love_for_nails,Great movie!,10,26 December 2012,"It was a very good movie. If you want to learn history, if you want to know exactly, bit by bit, what happened in that period you must read. Even if you have work, school and kids. People are very lazy nowadays and blame their lack of culture and knowledge about history and other stuff on work, school and the day-to-day responsibilities. Well I'm sorry to disappoint but the hurting truth is that you must read in order to learn more about everything. Movies entertain, that is their meant to be. If you rely on movies in order to get educated then you are not only stupid but even a fool.Still, like it is shown in the DVD commentaries the aspects altered in this movie where only made in order to have a good plot line. But that doesn't make it ""historycal inaccurate"", it's just what defines it and what defines in general a movie.It was great. The performances were wonderful. Orlando is a very good actor, he is one of my favorite actors, because of the simplicity, and at the same the level, the complicated way he delivers his characters. It cannot be described properly in words, he is just perfect for me, and I think he deserves more credit for his work, but in a basket full of snakes like Hollywood is, if you don't fight harder and don't bite nastier, you get trashed and called wooden.He deserves more, not this type of foolish fight. Anyway, the other actors were great as well. Liam Neeson was again a star in my eyes. He lightened the movie more with his, short is true, but lovable presence. Another character which I loved was the king. The real king, if I can call it like that. He was the soul of the hole situation, but his fate made me real sad.I consider it better than ""Gladiator"" because of it's more serious subject. The only good thing from that movie was Joaquin Phoenix who gave a wonderful performance and deserved the Oscar more than Russell Crowe, whom I personally don't consider him an Oscar-worthy actor.Anyway, worth watching.10/10",Kingdom of Heaven
314,tghoneyc,No one knows how to make epics like Ridley Scott,9,8 May 2005,"This was, in my opinion, quite a good film, and one that spoke more strongly than any I can recall of the strong belief in chivalry and loyalty. Unlike ""Gladiator,"" the events depicted in this film are not fabricated, but are based largely on an actual chapter in the Crusades. As fine a movie as ""Gladiator"" is, that fact always bothered me that it insisted on creating a false history of Rome.Excellent character work helps elevate this film even more. Orlando Bloom is Balian, a widower and blacksmith in France, and the illegitimate son of a Crusader, Godfrey of Ibelin (Liam Neeson, who turns in another fantastic performance). Godfrey returns to France to propose that his son join him in Jerusalem, currently under the control of the Christian King Baldwin (Edward Norton), who won't live to see thirty, thanks to his leprosy.Balian refuses his father's offer, and then murders the priest who insults his newly buried wife. After committing that deed, he joins with his father to forgive his sins in Jerusalem. After his father sustains a mortal wound from local law who seek to arrest Balian, they make the trek to Medina, where Godfrey dies, and Balian meets Guy De Lusignan (a truly villainous turn by the underrated Marton Csokas) a vicious Templar who is also heir to the throne of Jerusalem, by his marriage to Baldwin's sister, Sibylla (Eva Green).In Jerusalem Balian meets Tiberias (Jeremy Irons), the jaded magistrate to the king, whose job is to keep the peace, which includes punishing Templars who venture to disrupt the uneasy peace between the Christians in Jerusalem, and the brilliant military strategist and leader of the Saracens, Saladin (Syrian actor Ghassan Massoud). Chief among the Templars is the bloodthirsty Reynald De Chatillon (perfectly cast Brendan Gleeson).One of the biggest criticisms people have made about the film is the casting of Orlando Bloom in the role of Balian. While perhaps there was a better choice, I can't think, given his age, any other actor who could be cast in the role who hasn't already made a mockery of them self in another epic war movie (I'm thinking Colin Farrell). I thought while he was somewhat overshadowed by some of the other actors, Bloom managed to hold his own as the heroic knight who is forced to choose between what his conscience tells him to do, and the temptation that could corrupt him. There is one scene that is much reminiscent to a scene in ""Gladiator,"" where King Baldwin proposes he marry Sibylla, at the cost of Guy De Lusignan's execution. In retrospect, it reminds me of when Marcus Aurellius asks Maximus to be emperor.Liam Neeson makes quite an impression as Balian's father. Neeson is reaching a defining point in his career. He is one of the finest actors alive, and it shows. Jeremy Irons is also among those actors, but whereas Godfrey still has an idealistic view of Jerusalem, Tiberias is constantly asking himself why he came here.Of my limited knowledge of the Crusades, I knew that if anyone (non-French) could be cast as Reynald, it would be Brendan Gleeson. Whereas Gleeson's red hair is a characteristic that would work to his advantage in the role, the hair that he has in the movie is even redder.David Thewlis tops off the find supporting cast as the Hospitaler, a holy man who travels with the Crusaders primarily as a pacifist, but who can hold his own in battle. When Christians cry out to Crusaders ""To kill an infidel is not murder, it is the pathway to Heaven,"" the Hospitaler explains to Balian the dangers of ""religion."" Massoud is very noble as Saladin, and I hope to see him in more films produced for a western audience. He is a man who doesn't believe so much in the ideals of his people as in the duty he has to drive out all who would protect the Templars. The one inaccuracy that is made (at least in reviews) is that Saladin was a Kurd, and not a Muslim.The film is an antiwar movie, shot on an amazing scale, with beautiful cinematography, and seamless digital effects, but the message the audience takes away can be different, because the problem is one that we hear about in the news every day.",Kingdom of Heaven
315,jediduck95,disappointing,5,10 July 2005,"I had big expectations for this film. I liked 'Gladiator' and most of Ridley Scott's movies, but I couldn't have been more disappointed. The stories of the crusades are so interesting. There were interesting characters and horrific events that took place. This period of history was so interesting because all of these battles that took place were religious battles (or greed). Ridley Scott rarely uses religion as a main motivator for the purpose of the story and instead uses greed and humanity as a main motivator to most of the situations.I was confused the entire time that i was watching the movie. I was not sure what was happening and where and the motivation behind most of the actions of the story.Orlando Bloom was the wrong choice for the film, and i don't care how much meat he puts on himself. It's hard for me to believe that he be a leading hero that is able to lead an army or defend a city (especially when he started out as a blacksmith in the story and now he is a great swordsman that is able to lead a large group of people into battle?).Edward Norton (as the king) was the only redeeming character in the film (granted that he hides behind the mask). The rest of the characters seem like leftovers from 'Troy'.Some of the battle scenes are entertaining to watch but when i don't care for the characters or if i can't follow what is going on, then these scenes lose its momentum. I thought this movie would be better than 'Troy' but i was wrong. With all of Troy's flaws at least it was entertaining with a few interesting characters.This movie does not really appeal to anybody. There is not enough action to become entertaining and the drama is confusing to understand. There were mostly guys in the theater and after the movie ended them seemed upset about sitting through this 2 hour snorefest.The lesson here is that don't make a movie about the crusades if you're going to try to fit every aspect of it into one 2 hour film. It just becomes a huge mess.",Kingdom of Heaven
316,mynystry,A step backwards for R. Scott,5,12 July 2006,"Well... I heard before from a good source that this was not a very good movie... so I didn't hurry to see it, but finally curiosity took its toll today, only to prove what I heard before.It is a bit of a shame, that a director of such category as Ridley Scott make such a step backwards, needless to say that he had a huge budget to make this film.The film has many problems I think, it start from the casting; Orlando Bloom to be the hero of the movie... Wrong!! He played well his role in Troy as Paris, because in the Iliad he is defeated in the battle field and saved by Aphrodite, and Helen was ashamed of his cowardice... But he does a terrible job in Kingdom of Heaven, he is just not convincing as a great leader that can inspire courage to his fellow men.The story also doesn't have a logic or a clear development. Suddenly the wife of some guy suicide, and then he is going to Jerusalem, and suddenly he is a great warrior, and he sinks in the ocean, and then he is a noble, and then he sleeps with the princess, he is offered to be king but he doesn't accept, and some minutes later he becomes like a king by his mighty leadership, his huge knowledge of military strategic, etc... just too much!! the dialog is poor, and although the effects are some of the best of this film, sometimes they are just too exaggerated.It's a shame that they wasted a good chance to make a good film. I keep Gladiator in my collection, Kingdom of heaven has been just put into the garbage can :(",Kingdom of Heaven
317,nomercy,Latest release is sooo much better.,9,25 September 2006,"Anyone commenting on this movie based on the ""theatrical"" release, should re-review it based on the ""director'sc"" cut. What a difference when pathetic pinheads do not interfere with the editing. From the first time I saw the ""theatrical"" release, it felt incomplete, with such obvious voids and gaps that could not be explained. I just bought the extended version and it is a completely different movie. The whole story flows and is now rational. Previously incoherent or truncated scenes are now complete and make sense. If you liked it in its original form, you will love it in its complete form. As with many such movies, precision in terms of history or scholarliness is not so important as the message conveyed. This should be a must-see for all fanatics-in-waiting to realize that the hate they carry with them is manufactured by others for their selfish purposes. The other key message is that each of us is ultimately responsible for our actions and we will be judged by those actions and not by the excuses we make for them.",Kingdom of Heaven
318,cinna665,I think I've seen this movie before...,4,8 June 2005,"OK, I have now seen this movie. I also think I've seen this before... This is a big movie again. Big fights, lots of dead people, swords, blood, good people and bad people, and normal people there in between. The storyline in short is about a young boy who suddenly discovers his father is a Knight and is drawn on a crusade to save Jerusalem from the Muslims. Overall this movie made me again wonder how crazy people really are. It was not brilliant, but not totally bad either. I could give it 7/10. What was good: The idea of the story was more ""equal"" than in this kind of movies usually. There were not only bad Muslims and good Christians, but both sides has good and bad people, both sides had their own heroes and villains just like the normal life has. The movie did suit also to a non-religious person like me. It was not overly religious, but more dealing with the actual goodness and badness of people. The acting was brilliant in many places. Liam Neeson and Jeremy Irons were amazing, men of their own league. Also many other actors did a very good job. What was not so good: The storyline was predictable. After every single event you knew what is coming up next. Even though the story was about a crusade and everyone knows what has happened there, making a movie out of it could have more little twists. Now everything was so ""plain"" and a bit lame. There is the good king, bad guy who ruins it all, and the very good guy who tries to make it better. And a girl. Lots of fighting and so what. The shooting of the action scenes was a bit of a mess at times. There were scenes which just did not look good because it was just a mess. Well, war is, but when editing a movie it could be cut some other way. At least on big screen I had hard times to follow everything at parts. Orlando Bloom is cute, but not yet really a great actor. He has these very similar manners and expressions in all his movies, very serious and trying to be effective, but at the same time being a bit boring. And no looks can help that. He has potential though, so who knows what will become of him.And after Minas Tirith it is difficult to rate big fighting scenes objectively...",Kingdom of Heaven
319,EvilLost,"Entertaining, with a great message.",8,11 May 2005,"I went to see this movie because it was a 1) medieval and 2) war movie. However, I came away EXTREMELY surprised at the message it contained, along with the historical footnotes.For the first time in my movie going life, I see muslims that aren't portrayed to be evil!!! Coming from a loosely Muslim family (agnostic myself) this was a rather interesting point, and I especially liked that they showed BOTH SIDES to be caring about the others.Added on, the fact that there were people who believed the opposition should be wiped out because they weren't the same (again, on BOTH sides they had people like this) was a very good touch.The bishop during the final war scenes....just PERFECT. Perhaps because I am rather strongly anti-religious, but his lines, to me, were the absolute perfect image of what I see *MOST* religion as.At one point we see the Saracen king pick up that cross and set it on the table as well, it was a nice touch.Overall, the war scenes were entertaining, but the way both sides were displayed, especially the tolerant and intolerant people of BOTH sides won me over.",Kingdom of Heaven
320,Silent_Cal,A Story in Search of a Protagonist,7,27 February 2012,"Ridley Scott's movies should be taught in film schools, not because they are great movies -- none of them are -- but because they provide such a useful study in contrasts. You can see so easily what went wrong, and the many ways they fell short of greatness. ""Kingdom of Heaven"" was released in cinemas as a bloated historical action movie about bickering Crusaders, and while Scott's later edits turned it into a longer, more considerable epic, it's one that still bears his trademark faults.First the casting, good and bad. Scott recruited an excellent supporting cast, starting with Liam Neeson and Eva Green, and including Brendan Gleeson, Jeremy Irons, Alexander Siddig, and Ghassan Massoud. All of them bring their best efforts to the film; you can read their life stories in their faces. Neeson plays a knight hoping to atone for a youthful indiscretion; Green is the princess of Jerusalem, sister to a dying king and mother of the boy who will inherit the throne. Gleeson, with bright red hair, clearly relishes his role as a bloodthirsty Crusader lord, while Irons plays a weary nobleman trying to keep the peace. Siddig and Massoud represent the film's Muslims, with Massoud an especially strong presence as Saladin. All of these actors have depth and gravitas, and anchor the story in its historical setting. But above them all there's Orlando Bloom, a movie star known more for his perfect cheekbones than for his acting skills. He's almost impassive in his role as Balian of Ibelin, a blacksmith who becomes a knight, then rallies the defense of Jerusalem against Saladin's army. There doesn't seem to be much going on behind his eyes. Any other actor might have filled the spaces the script leaves for him, but Bloom is little more than a facade.Which brings us to the script. The writer, William Monahan, takes pains to lay out the historical backdrop for us. Christians and Muslims both claim Jerusalem, but some want to maintain the unstable peace while others want to upset it and start a war. Political and religious forces on all sides vie for domination. Meanwhile, other characters struggle to reconcile their actions with their beliefs, and find salvation where they can. From start to finish the movie confronts us with the hypocrisy of holy war, and of religious leaders who promise to absolve their followers' sins if they kill in God's name. But the movie makes the mistake of centering this conflict on Balian, a heavily fictionalized version of a real person, whose very emptiness renders him as a sort of blank slate for everyone else to act upon. The script feels unfinished, as if it was rushed into production before Monahan could produce a final draft. Maybe a different actor could have brought Balian to life in a more meaningful way, and communicated his internal conflicts to us with a expression or a gesture; but the script doesn't provide much for Bloom to work with, and instead we get a lot of sullen silences and brooding looks.The sets and costumes are beautiful, so long as the camera stays still long enough for you to see them. This is not the sort of dingy, muddy medieval movie we've gotten used to seeing in the past couple decades; instead, the clothes are colorful and richly textured, and the sunlit streets and palaces of Jerusalem just as vibrant. John Mathieson's cinematography shows us a Middle Ages much closer to the vivid and lively illuminated manuscripts than anything Hollywood has done before or since; it feels tactile and real in a way that most historical films don't. But Ridley Scott's direction is strangely impatient and jittery, with frequent recourse to slow-motion and other gimmicks. His style and pacing is at odds with the script's more contemplative needs. The story is meant to span three years, from 1184 to the Siege of Jerusalem in 1187, but Scott doesn't allow it any room to breathe. He's a music video director, worried that too much stillness will bore his audience.But those criticisms could easily be applied to any other Ridley Scott movie. A miscast protagonist, an unpolished screenplay, a visual style in conflict with itself. The result is a frustrating and clumsy film that never quite makes the points it so clearly wants to make. That's why it's so fascinating to watch: if only Monahan had put in a few more late nights honing his script; if only the casting director had searched a little harder for a leading man; if only Scott had calmed down his usual visual clamor, this could have been a truly great movie. There's an alternate universe where ""Kingdom of Heaven"" was directed by David Lean and starred Peter O'Toole, but in this universe we will have to tolerate the flawed version we have.",Kingdom of Heaven
321,ridleyrules,First half may be too complicated for American audiences,9,5 May 2005,"Five years after Gladiator, director Ridley Scott brings us a somewhat different type of story. It is set in the Middle Ages, in the times of the crusades. Orlando Bloom is a blacksmith who leaves France for the Middle East to find redemption.The story deals with the clash between religions, but does so in a very sensitive, intelligent and balanced way. There were quite a number of young people of Muslim decent in the theater where I watched it. The Muslim boy who sat next to me responded to some of the Arabic spoken. Nobody walked away during the screening.In essence, this is an anti-war movie. Action is surprisingly absent during most of the movie. In one case, only the aftermath of what must have been a terrible slaughter is shown, not the battle itself.During the first half of the movie, I found it hard to feel for any character or side. There are a lot of parties and people and it doesn't become clear immediately where all of this is leading us to. It may be tough to bite through for American mainstream audiences, who are used to seeing a clear fight between good and evil.During the second half, there is still no obvious black and white, but the story becomes more focused and easier to follow. I think the end really pays off well.Ridley Scott is once again a master of sucking you into to another time and place. I believed in this world. While you get to see only little brushes, he paints an environment that feels totally realistic.The soundtrack is always an important character in Ridley's work. He uses several composers and some non-original cues here. E.g. ""Vide con meum"" by Patrick Cassidy (used in ""Hannibal"") worked quite effectively. While adequate, I missed the total vision that someone like Hans Zimmer can bring to a movie like this. Hans must have been occupied by other projects, because together they can produce soundtracks that equal (""Gladiator"") or exceed (""Hannibal"") the quality of the film.Orlando Bloom plays a much more down to earth character than in the Lord of the Rings-trilogy, but shines and I felt for him. Check out Eva Green whose many different looks make up for the fact that she is the only female character in this tale of men. She has a Daryl Hannah type of beauty and it remains unpredictable what her character is going to do next. Also look out for kiwi actor Marton Csokas (also of LOTR fame) who brings a great presence to a rather small, but crucial role.I shall probably see this movie in the theater one or two more times, to capture the entire story and suck up a bit more of that medieval atmosphere.",Kingdom of Heaven

A film that points out the futility and stupidity of failing to live up to all of the rules and values of your religion teachings. The moment that exceptions are made, chaos and madness may be done in the name of God. This message is not always rendered subtly by Ridley Scott, but that is perhaps what is needed to gain the attention of many of us. We are all the same. We are both good and bad--and extremism is bad for all. While watching the film I was given the impression that some things were missing from the film. I have since learned that the DVD when released will contain some 80 additional minutes of film. The will probably fill in the holes nicely, and may make my rated 8 a 10.",Kingdom of Heaven

This one did.The casting was terrific, from Orlando Bloom's performance as a blacksmith turned warrior to Edward Norton's unseen face as King Baldwin to Jeremy Irons dark portrayal of Tiberius.What you also have in this movie is a very balanced, possibly politically correct, treatment of the whole issue of the Crusades and the war of Christians vs. Muslims.What I liked most, however, was the portrayal of Bloom's character. Balian was the quintessential citizen soldier who did his duty (boy, did he!) and wanted nothing in return.If you can stomach the violence (properly R-rated), this is a terrifically entertaining movie.",Kingdom of Heaven
325,sleestaker,Yet Another Attempt to Deconstruct Western Civilization,4,9 May 2005,"The more I think about Kingdom of Heaven, the more I dislike it. There's plenty of short-term annoyance here, but the deeper, subtle message is truly offensive.First of all is the leading man. Edward Norton plays a king who wears a mask for the entire film, and even he has more varied expression than Orlando Bloom. I swear, Bloom has ONE facial expression, whether he's in heavy combat or wooing the Queen of Jerusalem or wandering through the desert...his face NEVER changes. Keanu Reeves has more range than this guy! Bloom plays Balian, a nominal Christian who spouts secular humanist dogma and is more opposed to Christians than Muslims. He starts as a blacksmith, but after less than five minutes with his estranged noble father (Liam Neeson in little more than a cameo), he is able to defeat multiple trained soldiers. Why are the soldiers after him? Well, he murdered a priest, but that's OK, because he was an evil priest...one of many in this film. There's also the young scribe who screams, ""Killing an infidel is not murder, it's the path to heaven!"" and the priest in Jerusalem who doesn't give a damn about the people (their impending death is ""God's Will"") and is ready to immediately convert to Islam when faced with his own death.In fact most Christians in this movie are shown as evil, money-grubbing warmongers who have no concern for others. There is not one, NOT ONE Muslim portrayed as anything but noble. The only Christians who ARE shown in a positive light are Bloom, Jeremy Irons, and others who espouse the notion that one ""follow the heart"" rather than the teachings of the Saviour. This movie is meant to appeal to the deconstructionists out there who see white western Christians as the root of all evil in the world.As for the much-ballyhooed siege warfare scene, it's not all that interesting. The battle scenes in Lord of the Rings were far more visceral and exciting, and that was a FANTASY MOVIE! And how many more times do we have to see hand-to-hand combat in slow motion while a somber track with a wailing female vocal drowns out the sounds of battle. It's already a cliché.The poor Queen of Jerusalem, Sibylla, has almost no role other than to seduce Balian, but there is no chemistry there and Bloom still maintains his thousand yard stare. Once they have their night, all she does is sit in her chamber, brooding and staring out at the city. There are at least six cuts to her sitting there, saying nothing, looking out her window. It's impossible to care for her or to hope that she and Bloom wind up together.The only character worth remembering in the whole mess is Saladin, played with great aplomb by Ghassan Massoud. It's a shame that an equally engaging actor wasn't chosen for Balian, but since Ridley Scott's apparent motive was to lionize the Muslims and demonize the Christians, he obviously chose correctly.I was hoping for a fair treatment of the Crusades. What I got was the liberal complement to older movies that treated all Muslims as evil and all Christians as saints. There were good and bad guys on both sides, but Scott is trying to right the scale by going severely left rather than present an historically accurate film. In doing so, he fails. All he did was blow millions on a big budget piece of political correctness. The director of Blade Runner and Alien should be ashamed.",Kingdom of Heaven
326,autobenelux,valiant effort but a failure,5,12 October 2006,This movie is too complicated to reason. The initial scenes were like an excerpt from Macbeth too dark and the characters while exhibiting the medieval characterisation looked too theatrical and unreal.The Story line is complex initially and hard to comprehend but does unravel as the plot continues.The sets and the majesty of the scenes are splendid but nevertheless it moves into the realms of almost fantasy without explanation of the background of various scene changes. Bloom is to weak to carry the lead and the gore that pervades this production is totally over the top.Realism is of course worthy but do we have to have such obvious barbarism even though we all know it was how it was it some how ingratiating to re run these alleged clashes in glorious wide screen colour.History is a wonderful subject but somehow the popularising of the gory bits is stretching entertainment too far.In summary I consider that Scott has undertaken a colossal peace of work but he is misguided in his interpretation of how to entertain.Modern film makers have to be more subtle in their direction and less intent on treating us as if massacre is to be portrayed so life like and bloody.More effort in telling a story would be more valid.,Kingdom of Heaven

Kingdom of Heaven is the real quintessential epic film. firstly, I recommend this movie to viewers who are not just in it for the action. The figure of Saladin - one of the greatest and wisest men of his time - still gives us much to learn from, especially our generals nowadays are far away from his greatness. After reading many of the reviews of this film before me, it occurs to me that most of the people who did not like the film seem to be stuck on the fact that they thought it portrayed Christians in a bad light and Muslims in a perfect one. I knew Kingdom of Heaven would be a good movie right when I saw that the majority of negative reviews came from hardcore Christians. Bad reviews tend to mean that Muslims were portrayed properly. But,don't forget,it also has a message of ""Why are we fighting over the city that makes all our religions what they are? Why can't we just stop and make peace?"" ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is a masterpiece of film that ranks with films like ""Gladiator,"" ""Alexander,"" and ""Braveheart"" as one of the greatest historical epics of our time and the scenes of Jerusalim is breathtaking.... and also, Fantastic blu-ray with extended version that blows away the movie theater release, 3 hours long and worth seeing again and again.

330,geophyrd,Tremendous movie...everything that Alexander and Troy should have been,10,2 August 2006,"Before I review this movie, I have a couple of caveats worth caveatting First caveat: I'm into history. I've been in the SCA for more than 20 years, have fought in armor and love studying medieval period history. I am one of those guys who gets annoyed when the heraldry's wrong, let alone the history. I like it accurate. Some films get it right (Flesh and Blood, Braveheart) and others pretend (Alexander, Troy) and others don't even bother trying (Robin Hood, Price of Thieves, Army of Darkness). I have uses for all of them, but the first one holds a special place in my heart.Second caveat: KoH came out at the same time (approx) as Troy and Alexander, both highly inferior flicks. I think its why the flick got buried. It shouldn't have been. If it came out a year earlier or a year later, this would have been a blockbuster.The review: KoH was excellent. The story line was intriguing and rang very true. The characters are (I think) mostly fictional but there were no doubt men and women just like the characters. The battles were spellbinding and for once, they used CGI the way it should have been used: to enhance the reality not the surreality.The story is simple. A blacksmith whose wife just dies meets his father, a noble who raped his mother years before. The man apologizes, offers to take the blacksmith with him to Jerusalem to join the crusades. Along the way, stuff happens. When he gets there, more stuff happens and when it is all over, stuff stops happening. What lies between the beginning and the end is a fascinating, enjoyable story.The actors (Orlando Bloom, Jeremy Irons, Liam Neeson briefly and everyone else) do an excellent job. I don't know who played the king but even in his leper clothes, he was excellent.I highly recommend this movie. I watched it a little grudgingly but got into it quickly.Oh, and the heraldry was (I'm pretty sure) right for a change. King Richard's standard on his chest was the one he adopted during the crusades, the 2 Lions Rampant and Countered, not the Lion Rampant and Roaring that always gets used but was only used by him when at home.

The viewers are treated as brain amputees who are supposed to swallow down this nonsense and ""politically correct"" crusade bashing. Historical facts are either ""adapted"" or omitted so the viewer gets the idea that the Muslim Arabs were nothing but chivalrous gentlemen and the only evildoers were Christian priests and crusaders. The fact that Christian-Jewish Jerusalem was conquered by the Arabs (Caliph Omar Ben Hatav in 638) and placed under Muslim rule is, of course, omitted as is the small detail that in 1010 Caliph Hakim ordered the destruction of churches and synagogues. Instead we see a lot of catholic priests being outright villains (at the beginning), hatred mongers (at Messina) or total sleaze-bags (at Jerusalem). Sure, why not do that kind of vilification: it is quite unlikely that a Christian monk will protest, right?? At the same time, we are treated ad nausea with portrayals of Muslim leaders who are - as opposed to the infidel invaders - men of honor and moral integrity. Who cares about the fact that Saladin would normally have the captured crusaders beheaded and after the siege of Jerusalem he actually demanded ransom from all the Christians in order to let them go - so those who were not able to pay it were sold as slaves? It is much more pleasing to see an alternative history here, as imagined by Monahan & Scott...I wonder what's coming next: a movie about the battle of Vienna, depicting the Christian armies as cutthroat savages slaughtering the noble Turks who only came to spread multiculturalism and peace?

332,andynaik,"A very good movie, but some drawbacks",7,9 May 2005,"Overall, I will say this is a very good movie.The director assures that audience don't get bored in the first few minutes wherein the father of Balian comes to take him to Jerusalem. The first few minutes are absolutely enthralling and the movie moves at an amazing speed.However, after Balain reaches Jerusalem, the movie tends to stall a little bit and gradually one tends to lose interest. I haven't the least bit idea about the history of Jerusalem, so people like me are more interested in the purpose of Balian.More minutes are wasted in characters and unnecessary dialogs until finally Saladin arrives on the scene.Fans of LOTR will certainly look forward to the battle scenes here although in LOTR trilogy, the battles were huge and the number of warriors was amazing. Yet, this movie pulls off stunning battle scenes although only few moments of the battle is really shown in this movie. The battles end abruptly at the end of each day and clearly one does not get an idea of what each side has gained or lost.Finally, Balian surrenders to Saladin simply aware of the fact that his forces will not last against that of Saladin and that his ultimate aim is to achieve peace and harmony in Jerusalem.Although, this movie lags in some respects, this is a visual treat. The cinematography is excellent.So, better spend a few bucks on it...",Kingdom of Heaven

It shows wisdom and kindness of two great leaders of the different sides of a very bloody crusade.The movie would've been perfect if it wasn't for the main character, Balian. It's not that Orlando Blood is a terrible actor (well, not a great one either), but it's the decision the character makes that leaves a lot to be desired. Especially in the directors cut: Balian is presented with the opportunity to save the kingdom of Jerusalem from the clutches of an evil ruler and in doing so, marry the love of his life.But no, Balian has to be goody two-shoes, and choses piety and a weird sense of morality over the faith of the realm.

Oh well, so much for my review then...! Kingdom of Heaven is enjoyable in its way, and it's full of visual wonders. That is of course a Ridley Scott trademark, but another regular Scott trademark is what I would call pomposity, though others might be more charitable and call it an operatic sense of drama, or something. Too often I found myself grumbling at the movie, asking the music to shut up or the supporting players not to look quite so awestruck at Orlando's achievements. I actually have no problem with his performance; true, he's not exactly Maximus, but then Maximus was a military commander throughout Gladiator. Here Balian is a blacksmith who rather quickly learns close-quarters fighting, then irrigation techniques, then finally the art of defending a city from a siege. It's the script I don't believe in, not the performance. In fact the performances are generally great, although the best of them (Jeremy Irons and Ghassan Massoud are underused). And was it me, or was Edward Norton deliberately trying to sound like Marlon Brando? The more bloodthirsty of the crusaders were a little irritating (I didn't recognize Marton Csokas as the same man who played the diametrically different Celeborn!) but then again history is full of leaders bent on pursuing courses of action that are directly contrary to their own best interests. There was a point in all the shouting of ""God wills it!"" (from both sides) that I decided Kingdom of Heaven, or something like it, would have made a great satire on power and the abuse of religion. Instead it's simply a comment on them, and a plea for tolerance. I have to admit I wanted to cheer when Balian threatened to destroy every single holy site in Jerusalem so people would stop fighting over it.",Kingdom of Heaven
336,geo-546-616925,"Quite Good, but...",7,17 September 2013,"It is actually inevitable not to compare 'Kingdom of Heaven' with 'Gladiator', Scott's most successful historical film. And that's why I'm going to write this review by contrasting those two movies, despite not being a great fan of 'Gladiator'.Technically and aesthetically 'Kingdom of Heaven' is rather inferior, even though I really liked the cinematography. The battles are not that impressive and the story is not very interesting. It also lacked a powerful protagonist; Russel Crowe's performance was phenomenal, while Orlando Bloom acted just fine.On the other hand, I have to praise the rest of the cast: Edward Norton (even behind his mask!), Ghassan Massoud, Eva Green, David Thewlis, Jeremy Irons and Brendan Gleeson added a lot to this movie. Also, and that's important, I found the film's message to be much deeper than 'Gladiator'.All in all, 'Kingdom of Heaven' is an enjoyable film. However, you won't be poorer if you don't watch it.",Kingdom of Heaven
337,iKickstand,"Another well made Scott film, but we've seen it all before",4,11 March 2006,"Well i'll start by saying this film isn't exactly badly made, although most of the problem is it just doesn't offer much new material that we haven't seen before from this genre. I cant really complain about the acting, in a film where even Orlando Bloom gave a good performance. It would have been better however if Liam Neeson had starred a bit longer, but he was yet again only reduced to the first half hour or so of the film.For a film of this nature, I thought the soundtrack was a bit bland to be honest. I guess the film's main highlights were the big and small battle scenes, and although remaining realistic and interesting, I couldn't help feeling the final battle had spent to much time trying to be identical to the one at the end of The Two Towers.Kingdom of Heaven is a well acted and choreographed movie, that suffers from very clichéd pre-battle dialogue and a predictable plot. I guess it may be entertaining to those who have yet to see the likes of Spartacus, gladiator or the lotr films. But for anyone who has, this feels like just another carbon copy which has little new to offer. I would like to say it is still an entertaining way to spend an evening, but with a plot that is dragged out to 2 hours+ just to make it feel more epic, I fail to see the point of more movies like this when we already have similar, better alternatives.Of course it was directed by the legend that is Ridley Scott though who has earned the right to make a few mistakes like this.",Kingdom of Heaven
338,tmills777,"What was missing here? Oh, yeah, the reason for the Crusades.",6,16 May 2005,"It is clear from this film that Ridley Scott has little use for, or understanding of, Christianity. This is why he populates his crusaders with agnosticism, at best, and outright atheism at worst. You can view this film a hundred times and never come away with a compelling reason for why men in Europe would risk their lives to go on a dangerous mission to free Christianity's most sacred sites from the infidel Saracen. The real-life Balian was a very devoutly religious man, unlike the confused former blacksmith we see in the film. The real Balian went to a town on the day of the Feast of Peter and Paul, to awake the archbishop to have a discussion about the lives of the two saints.Raynald De Chatillon was indeed a very bad man, who was the pretext for Saladin's assault on Jerusalem, but Saladin was planning to divest the city anyway, and slaughter the entire populace,btw.. Being a very devout Muslim, he could not continue to allow Christian infidels to hold the city. Balian delivered the city to him because he had few men-at-arms to defend the city. Saladin did not allow the populace to just leave, but did allow them to redeem themselves. Balian defended the city, not for the sake of the people living in Jerusalem, but because of the presence of the holy sites sacred to Christians. The most sacred site in Jerusalem was the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the place where Christ was crucified (viz. The Passion of the Christ). Saladin was not an honorable man, as the film depicts. He had defeated the Crusader army and then had the captured knights brought to him to be beheaded in front of him. He had the right under Koranic Law, to make the church on Golgotha a mosque. He did not do so, but did drive out the religious orders of the other churches in Jerusalem. He allowed a small coterie of priests to continue their duties at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. When he entered the city he enslaved most of the inhabitants who could not buy their freedom. Balian would also have known where the CHS was located and would not have had to ask. The reason for the crusades in the first place was because the Muslims, who controlled Jerusalem a century before, restricted access to the city and Bethlehem by Christian pilgrims. Most people are also unaware that during this period, the Muslims went on their own ""crusades"" attacking Christian churches and congregations throughout their territories in the middle east. The Crusades were a greatly belated attempt to protect Christians in the Levant and elsewhere in the region. Over 1300 Christian churches were destroyed thusly. Some things never change, it seems. Technically this was a superb film. It could have been a great film, if Ridley Scott hadn't put a modern spin to the real reason for the Crusades.",Kingdom of Heaven

Orlando Bloom stars as 12th-century French blacksmith Balian, who loses his family and is invited to the Holy Land by the Crusader father (Liam Neeson) previously unknown to him. The uneasy peace in Jerusalem between the Christians, under King Baldwin IV (Edward Norton), and the neighbouring Muslim forces of Saladin (a wonderful Ghassan Massoud) is threatened by fanatics, prompting Balian to defend the city against overwhelming odds. A story about western forces in the Middle East has obvious contemporary resonance, but Scott steps skilfully through the minefield, stressing the desirability of co-existence and tolerance and the dangers of fundamentalism.

The trouble is of course that there are not many suitable British actors left that would suit this role. What I would really love to see is Ridley Scott do a remake of the King Arthur legend, maybe using Marion Zimmer Bradleys 'Mists of Avalon' upon which to base the story. Apart from the rotten dialogue it had more of a ring of truth to it than Thomas Mallory's Morte d'Arthur. Ridley Scott could make this into something truly magical.

348,GrunterGrimm,"A big, bloated, forgettable Hollywood bore",6,29 October 2005,"Orlando Bloom wears one expression throughout, to match his wooden ""performance"". It requires Scott's direction and a generic Hollywood plot to puff Bloom's blacksmith character up to the dimensions of a combination of Jesus Christ (saviour of mankind - or at least the multi-ethnic, multi-religious population of Jerusalem in a nod to modern ""diversity""), Superman (superior, indestructible fighter) and Napolean (master tactician). The basics of the Crusades are covered here or are mentioned in passing: the back-and-forth occupation of Jerusalem by Turks and Christians; the infighting amongst those same Christians; the famous Crusader castles such as Kerak; Crusader armies decimated by the heat while wearing heavy armour; those cool, round shields of the Turks and their light, mobile horses and light armour; the diseases of the time such as leprosy; Saladin and his Seljuk Turks; and the fighting Christian monastic orders of St. John's, and the Hospitalers.The monotonous Bloom, Liam Neeson playing himself, a barely-registering Jeremy Irons, Edward Norton mumbling behind a leper's mask, and David Thewliss without enough of a part to fully develop his Hospitaler character, portentiously proclaim their lines of pompous spectacle dialog. A great battle scene at the end redeems the movie otherwise I would have given it a rating of 5. Ridley Scott only seems to make either a really great movie or a really rotten one, and has developed a bad habit of picking uncharismatic, pretty-boy actors like Bloom and Josh Hartnett for his leads.",Kingdom of Heaven
349,mrforgetful,"Not terrible, but mediocre in almost every way",6,30 July 2005,"Kingdom of Heaven is not an altogether horrible film, actually there is quite a lot to praise. The costumes and sets are all very well done, the music is nice, and the acting is serviceable. Well, thats about it. Everything else is mediocre compared to greater historical epics like Gladiator and Braveheart. The movie starts out in Europe where Orlando Bloom's character, Balian, has just lost his family and is understandably moody about it. Then Liam Neeson shows up and tells him that he is his father and that he should join him in his merry quest to Jerusalem. Well some stuff happens and Balian comes along. After some more stuff happens, including a confusing boat scene where Balian's ship sinks but he's washed up on shore miles away for some reason, he finally makes it to Jerusalem. (pardon my fast forwarding to more important matters) It is at Jerusalem that Balian somehow becomes an expert tactician and a cunning warrior. Having seen only a 5 minute lesson on swordplay from Liam Neeson earlier in the film, this is one of the bigger things that makes this movie unbelievable. So throughout the movie we meet some interesting characters. Unfortunately, all but one are under-developed and not seen enough on screen. The one exception is King Baldwin, voiced by Edward Norton. I found it a nice twist that amongst all the greedy nobles and battle-hardened warriors, the strongest character in the movie is a leper king who must wear a mask constantly. So naturally, the best character dies prematurely. Other interesting characters, including Hospitaler (Prisoner of Azkaban's David Thewlis) and Tiberias (Jeremy Irons)are easily likable but aren't seen enough to make them memorable. So by the end of the movie, there's only been one real battle and it was kind of a bummer because it was pretty dumb. Pretty much all of the characters have died except Orlando Bloom, and meanwhile a massive Islamic army who's been marching along throughout the whole movie is nearing the city. By now, it really doesn't matter who wins or not because it's hard to care. There's no one to really root for. All the cool characters are gone and we're left with Balian and a bunch of citizens including a whiny priest. But the battle starts, and you just watch it seemingly cut and pasted from return of the king (i'll allow some room for historical accuracy. its very possible that the battle could have looked like that, but still...). To sum up, Kingdom of Heaven is too long, underdeveloped, and lacks a certain vibe of energy that makes Gladiator so exceptional. Not to mention Russell Crowe. I was really disappointed because Ridley Scott was the director and his Gladiator is one of my favorite movies ever. So all in all, watch if you're craving a new swords and sandals epic, but if you're happy with what you've got on your DVD rack, stick with that.",Kingdom of Heaven

Having Orlando Bloom as the main actor does not guarantee anything, although some people will still suffer the halo-effect of this person from LOTR. From the movie itself, I would not give any credits. No matter how I look at it, it is still a standard movie or even less because it fails to fulfill the expectation from the audience.From the technical point a view, I can surely say that LOTR has much better screen shot, effect, and the most important for this kind of movie - the battle scene. The worst thing goes to the story itself which could have been done better. I do not know what the director was thinking of when he made the scenario. It absolutely is rubbish! There is no stunning opening, climax, or even well ending - where the audience will still feel they're really on the movie.I thought Ridley Scott (the director) would make Kingdom of Heaven even more stunning than the Gladiator. Furthermore, I think he fails to deliver the message in this movie because there is no affection to the audience.Anyway, Kingdom of Heaven has a storyboard about crusades war between Christians and Muslims in Jerusalem. Franse smid Balian, or will become Balian of Ibelin (Orlando Bloom), is a blacksmith somewhere in France. Apparently he is the son of Balian of Ibelin (Liam Neeson) who is serving the King. With an objective to find forgiveness, Balian starts his journey to Jerusalem where he will find his new path including his meeting with Sibylla (Eva Green). Facing new problems arise in Jerusalem, Balian has the main challenge where he has to defend Jerusalem and its people from the leader of Muslims army, Saladin (Ghassan Massoud).Another pity is the relationship between Balian and Sibylla which is barely exposed.

352,jmcleod_5,A brilliant film-maker in all respects,10,13 May 2005,"Ridley Scott proves once again that he is one of the truly great film-makers of modern times. He hardly ever puts a foot wrong. Even his mediocre films are a cut above the rest. So to speak. I don't care what anyone says I liked Hannibal and I even liked G.I. Jane. Who wouldn't after seeing Demi Moore buffed up like that.Now I'm not a big fan of Orlando Bloom. He was a journeyman in Lord of the Rings. He was so-so in Pirates of the Carrebean. The less said about Troy the better. Maybe it's because he is surrounded by superior and more seasoned performers. He looks puny and insignificant beside Viggo, Johnny, Eric and Brad. In this film however he steps up to the plate and handles himself well against veterans like Neeson and Irons. He seems to have beefed up. He doesn't look so wimpy anymore. He also knows very well by now how to handle the sword. As he should.The way religious matters were handled in this film were very well done. There was good and bad on both sides. I'm not religious per se but the flux of Muslim bashing in a lot of recent films (particularly since September 11) is becoming tedious and totally unnecessary. We shouldn't let a few rotten apples spoil the barrel. One last thing. Why is the very good actor Liam Neeson getting cast as the sage wise father-figure, who dies a brutal death after only a few minutes of screen time, in nearly every film he is in. (Gangs of New York, Kingdom of Heaven, Batman Begins, even The Phantom Menace.) Where's the roles like he had in Rob Roy and Schindler's list? Don't get me wrong. His small roles in these films are great but I miss the Neeson of old.After all that I must say that Ridley Scott, the man who gave us Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, Thelma and Louise, Hannibal, Matchstick Men and Black Rain has done it again.

The last one that had an impact on me was ""The Long Ships"" in 1963, starring Richard Widmark as the Viking Rolfe and Sidney Poitier as Saladin. This is a visually stunning film, but from my perspective, it was somewhat flawed. Cast: Refers not only to actors, but also the roles they play and the way that they play them. Orlando Bloom was wonderful as the strong and silent Legolas who had no responsibility to lead the Fellowship of the Ring, but he doesn't work as Balian. Balian is too good with a sword and much too good as a siege master. The character portrayed, which was little like the character he was based on: was without education, likely could not read and definitely could not deal with the overwhelming Saracen army. The actual Balian was of noble birth and was prepared for the siege. As point of note, Saladin did not let the people just walk off. A bounty was paid on nearly every person who walked out of Jerusalem. Balian himself paid a lot of that bounty. This is the problem when you take a person and drastically change him for the sake of a story line. The rest of the cast was well done but much of the movie rises and falls on the believability of Bloom in the major role. Story - It is too much of an attempt to speak to the circumstances of today. Production Values - Visually spectacular, well edited, but suffers from Ridley Scott's attempt to make Balian over in his own image. Scott, who calls himself an agnostic, stated that Balian in the move became agnostic. In life, Balian was a very pious man who even once refused earlier to fight on Sunday. Music - A fair presentation. very reminiscent of some of Jerry Goldsmith's work in ""The 13th Warrior."" Creativity - Has gone a place where others have not gone in a long time. Used special effects to create a remarkable visual palate that drew the viewer into the 12th Century. World View - Suffers too much from putting a 21st century spin on a 12th Century story.

355,markymarky,Average Film.....,6,14 November 2005,"I saw this film on DVD the other night and had great expectations for it. I know the reviews were not great but neither were they too damning - so I was hopeful I would see a real gem. Alas - it was not to be. I cannot say it was bad movie but neither can I saw it was a really good either. The main problems with it were as follows:1. Story. It was a bit muddled and at times a little hard to follow. Certain things happen during the film to maybe imagine that Balian (played by Orlando Bloom) just may be a little special. He survives a boat sinking, he turns arid land into fertile land, his horse suddenly appears to him when he is almost dead from exhaustion, he deflects swords in battle when he truly should have been killed. And as I watched this I was prepared to go along with the whole 'protected by God' element but in the end - there was nothing about it. 2. Dialogue. The words the actors were asked to speak at every turn were preachy, prophetic, always full of meaning and wise. It was a little like reciting Shakespeare instead of true interaction with other people. I suppose the makers were trying to imbue a higher sense of gravitas into the film but it comes off a tad annoying after a while.3. Acting. I have not seen any of the Lord of the Rings films where Bloom first made his name so I cannot comment on his acting ability in those pictures. However - I did see him in Troy, and thought his performance was embarrassingly bad. Still, he has that kind of demeanour about him that you want to see him succeed - so I still had high hopes for him in this film. He was better than Troy but still way off what you require from a leading man. It seemed a deliberate ploy from the writer/director to have Bloom gazing somewhere just off camera but not say anything. His lines were very few and far between and maybe the rumours of Scott not wanting Bloom in the first place have some credence. Norton has an unplayable part but does his best with it. Irons and Neeson come out of it reasonably well also. Bloom though - for all his posturing and good-looks - just needs something else to elevate his career. I'm sure he will go on from this to be better and better but as things stand now - he needs to improve.There are enough good qualities in the film to push its rating to an average level - great cinematography, lush production values (nothing is cheap or skimpy here), good battle scenes. But in the end it could all have been far better and in my humble opinion would have been if the storyline had been more concentrated on Bloom's character only - letting the bigger Christian/Islam battle aside.6/10.",Kingdom of Heaven
356,lynton,CGI has helped battle scenes so much,8,11 May 2005,"Master director Ridley Scott (Gladiator) sure loves his battle epics. Like Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven pushes a plot with the epic battle scenes. But unlike Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven's plot seems slightly weak  maybe because it doesn't have an actor the ilk of Russ Crowe to propel that plot along. Sorry to say it, but Orlando Bloom just doesn't cut it here. He tries, sure, and looks like he's trying the whole film. Trying hard.It's good he's well-supported (Liam Neeson, Jeremy Irons, Ghassan Massoud) because otherwise, this would be a much lesser film.Kingdom of Heaven is indeed wonderfully cast, and the battle scenes are almost unique  Scott captures the confusion and sheer brutality of battle brilliantly, with grainy film and swirling camera techniques. As all those arrows rain down, you wonder how the hell they ever made effective battle scenes without CGI.One overhead shot of the two armies fighting head-to-head on the broken walls of Jerusalem says more than any anti-war message could. It's also gory at times; although Scott doesn't dwell on blood, but on the stupidity of war.KOH is also very PC, probably too much so. Scott does present the two sides as people, which is refreshing. Neither the Muslims nor those inside Jerusalem are painted as bad or good, no one is to blame...but there are war-like people on both sides.But he may have taken PC too far - there are moments which seem odd, such as Saladin stopping to place the gold crucifix back on the altar...is that credible?However, in the end, there's little doubt Scott is one of the best film-makers today, whether he's fighting the alien, con men, Romans or war itself.",Kingdom of Heaven

It also makes the point that we Christians are indeed what I can only describe as bast***s declaring war throughout history in the name of god to gain land which doesn't belong to us so we can exploit the profits of that land for the sake of our own fat greedy self-indulgent populous. Am I taking about Iraq or the crusades here????

Men created religion to control us and lie to men, I'm glad to say organised religion is somewhat laughed upon now in my country now days, not because I disagree with the moral messages it conveys but because I can't trust our so called leaders both spiritual and political.But anyway to some up, to anyone who says in the usual crash o.t.t manner ""This film sucks"" I say you are wrong, this film is more than Gladiator or any other resent epic primarily because of its relevance not only now and but throughout history and I dare say sadly it's message will still be of relevance for many generations to come.",Kingdom of Heaven

360,Nerdboy1423,Director's Cut Review,10,28 May 2006,"I believe that it was a grievous error on the part of Fox to release the trimmed down piece of crap Scott vignette that was the theatrical Kingdom of Heaven. It just wasn't a film, it was a bunch of battle scenes with some interesting but surface level philosophizing. The director's cut, adds depth, gravity and wisdom to the film as a whole, completing all the character arcs and creating a whole, more real temporal world. Balian is no longer a bizarre and cold character who turns into a leader, and Sybilla is no longer a sex-starved Queen of Jerusalem. Every character has layer upon layer of intention to drive their action now, and Sybilla's character I now believe is probably one of the more interesting characters in the story, given her arc with Balian, Guy, and her son who was not previously in the film at all. The thing that really upsets me though is that this is, unlike the LOTR directors cut, not filled with fluff for genre fans. This is an actual film, the film that should have been released but wasn't. Don't Studio executives know by now to trust Ridley Scott? Haven't they already botched and blundered most of his projects and haven't the director's cuts been viewed as masterpieces? The huge amount of film that was cut from the theatrical version that is present here was completely necessary to make a real experience for the audience. I'm am so deeply sad for Scott and so enraged at Fox, Warners, Universal, for never having faith in this talented genius artist. Please, if you can, watch the director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven, it was the film we were meant to see.",Kingdom of Heaven
361,ferretpossum,Let Down By Orlando,7,27 April 2005,"This film had the potential to be better than Gladiator - for a start it's a great deal more accurate and it also boasts a smarter script full of contemporary analogies that link it to present-day Middle East conflict.The special effects are just as spectacular as in Gladiator, and other recent battle epics like King Arthur, and there's a great cast including Jeremy Irons, David Thewlis, Liam Neeson and I really like Eva Green too.Unfortunately none of these people are the star. Orlando Bloom is. This man is rapidly turning into the English Keanu Reeves - his acting style is best described as ""Noble and Anguished"". Sometimes he stretches himself and is ""Anguished and Noble"" instead. He blows the film's big lines and epic moments and reduce this movie to Gladiator-Lite. The other casting problem is Martin Csokas as Guy de Lusignan who is no more than Dick Dastardly in Crusader's garb.That said, I enjoyed the film, even if I was disappointed that it wasn't better. The battle sequences are excellent and the film contains a surprisingly tolerant message, given the subject.",Kingdom of Heaven
362,sancticus,Kingdom of spectacular scenery,6,20 October 2005,"Death has visited Balian and he has lost all of his family and most of his faith in god. It is at this time that his father a knight comes to seek him out and offer him a place by his side in the crusade for Jerusalem. Destiny has it that he will follow, and his father instill the virtues of true knighthood unto his son. This is much needed as the corruptness of the holy church and it's templars is quite evident (like today) when he arrives in the holy city. We follow him through his struggles as the governing powers of Jerusalem changes, and the following inevitable war. The scenery of this movie is really spectacular and a real feast for the eyes. The battles are well made and Riddley Scott has done a his homework. The problem is Orlando Bloom. Sporting his first leading role he is not convincing at all. His one facial expression and picture perfect face does not lend itself to the story. It's like watching Beckham trying to be macho. This mistake was made in Troy (Brad Pitt) and Alexander (Colin Farrel) as well and disrupts the entire movie. Look at the classics: Ben Hur, El Cid (Charlton Heston), Spartacus (Kirk Douglas), Braveheart (Mel Gibson), Gladiator (Russel Crow) and then try to picture Mr.Beckham as the lead in those movies and you'll get my point. Don't cast a boy to do a mans work. Still it's a fair portrayal of the crusades from both the sides, and one that really focuses on the lack of virtue and the faults that has been committed in the name of god. Something that it seems we can never learn.",Kingdom of Heaven
363,Transom32,Best Siege Flick there is!!!,10,15 January 2006,"The siege scen es are the definitive mid-evil fortress siege moments. The best depiction and use of trebuchets in movie history, simply stunning how these simple machine of war were so terrifyingly powerful.I have only a few sticklers and these are spoilers so go no further if you don't' like spoilers. There are a number of lapses in continuity or perhaps just bad editing, but these are just quibbles.During the siege, there are several shots of hundreds of defenders in the area behind the main wall armed with long pikes as used in 'Braveheart' against the calvary charge. They are in a defensive line position and it looks very formidable.In the final release of the film these are shown in context of waiting in case the main gate is bashed in, however I believe they were shot and meant to be used for the scene when the weak wall is destroyed by the trebuchets, however when this scene comes we get a version where after the wall crumbles we get this rag tag scramble of a handful of defenders running up the wall of rubble to meet the enemy. The leader had studied his fortress in depth and would have been prepared for this weak point giving.That point is the only disappointment in the whole battle as it devolves into an Mtv slow-moe scene of swinging swords in dense smoke or dust and then a morph to the after battle scene. The leader was so well prepared for every other part of the siege I think the shots of the line of pikes was supposed to be for the wall breach and he would have had his men hold back and forced the enemy to come into the courtyard to attack this lethal line while archers rained death down from the two high walkways on both sides. This would have been a meat grinder that would have easily chewed up half of the enemy army. My guess is that they ran out of budget and could not film those scenes or they just did not work so were left on the cutting room floor.The other editing quibble has to do with the scene after the first day of the siege when the hero is in a storage room with large containers and using torches. They have a conversation, except there is no clue as to what this room is or why they are in it. I suspect it was either a supply of water or oil they had laid up in preparation. If it was oil, I doubt they would enter using the huge torches they had, so I think it was water, and they must have been talking strategy, that the enemy could only stay outside the city for so long, because his water supply is limited, and they have enough to last longer than the enemy.Anyway, just quibbles, loved the film, one of the directors best.

It's beautifully filmed, it's a true eye candy.But it's so politically correct (read: so historically untrue) that one can't help wondering: why not to choose a fantasy setting instead? Then there would be no need to stay 'correct' - total freedom of imagination. Anyway, aside from brief appearance of King Richard the Lionheart there are no historical 'superstars' involved. Why the Earth then? I see no reason for this.And why the Second Crusade which was relatively unimportant anyway? Why the love story which couldn't even take place? Why a happy ending when the real Sybilla died in the siege of Acre accompanying her husband Guy? Let's face the truth: the real Balian was twice as old and married to Sybilla's mother and they had four children. It was his only marriage and he never lived in Europe. He had two brothers neither of whom he killed.Also crusaders are portrayed as zealous and fearless madmen. They were none of that. Cruel, vicious and greedy they were but also practical.When I watched the movie I saw much wasted potential. As a fairytale in a fantasy setting it could have been perfect. But now the only really interesting motif is the man's inability to find God in war. But this part of the storyline is very fragmentary and lacks any clear conclusion. ""Thin Red Line"" tells the same tale much more vividly.7/10 for the visuals.",Kingdom of Heaven
366,mdenvee,A quality film w/ an obvious political agenda...TOO BAD,4,2 April 2013,"If you enjoyed Troy and Alexander, you will enjoy this movie as well. Plenty of action, convincing special effects, suspense and good music and excellent cinematography and scenery. The actors are on the whole good as well (some better than others) but nothing that would either ruin the film or make it exceptional (I did like the Muslim King the most though). I was disappointed in three regards. One, Liam Neeson was dead in the first quarter of the movie (sooner actually). Further, I really like his cohort of fighters which were all unfathomably killed in the forest. Two, the movie had tons of irritatingly implausible story lines, such as Bloom not accepting the Kingship and the princess for stupid reasons, and thereby permitting the rule under the vicious King and the loss of a girl he loves, and the ruination of the city- utterly implausible and unrealistic. Three, the entire film is an ANTI-Christian effort, beginning with the village priest decapitating Bloom's dead wife for religious reasons, to the non-stop cowardly, nauseating and hypocritical characterizations of the Jerusalem priest who single-handedly makes the Church look like the real villain of the movie (""convert to Islam, repent later""). There is a passive attempt to also include a more belligerent Muslim general, but on the whole the Muslims are portrayed as honorable and good, or at worst neutral in their campaign to take over the city. The new King and the templars are the antagonists throughout the movie, starting with the deliberate cruel murder of the sister of the Muslim King, and the futile unprovoked attack on the Muslims in the desert. The overall portrayal of the Templars and Christians is disgustingly political (Bloom: ""the Christians butchered every Muslim behind these walls"". Muslim King: ""I am not those men""). While the film attempts to attach all the vicious cruelty to the new King, his general, and the single priest, the impact is obviously against Christians and pro-Muslim. It is a clear effort by the director and producers to make a historical film which spoke to the virtues of Islam and the cruelty of Christians, and very possibly a message regarding the post-9/11 war in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as a message against the US support of Israel in the middle East. To be honest, I did not observe these messages on my first viewing of the film (like most us who don't notice a lot of things at first). But on a 2nd and 3rd watching, it is obvious and a shame. Otherwise, the film could have been very good, an 8 score, but minus 4 for the absurd politics interwoven.",Kingdom of Heaven

This could almost be an epic.. but unfortunately, Hollywood insists on spoiling otherwise excellent artistic production with the most crude incompetence on historical data.Medieval history, as all recorded history is incomplete. We know some things.. we are not quite sure of others.. and there are many things we actually do not know. 800 years old history is obscure enough for unknown details to be romanticized. But there are also things we do know and this film has no respect for those. Filling the gaps with creativity is OK.. disregarding historical facts and then sell the film for a quality product is not OK. In this respect, this film is a fraud.Filming on historical issues and using real historical characters bears a responsibility that Hollywood, even Ridley Scott, is unworthy of. Any similarity of the argument of this film with historical truth is not mere coincidence.. it's sheer fraud.The argument could be free of historical names and characters. That would be a good option for a director uncommited to historical detail. Then, any story could be told.. as fiction, of course. But to use historical characters in a film that crudely ignores historical confirmed facts is a particularly mean sort of incompetence: the sort that results from low intellectual standards. Art is, or should be, associated with high intellectual standards. Ridley Scott, and Hollywood in general, proved once again that they are not artists. They are very good artisans.

His wife's suicide makes him want to seek salvation at Jerusalem. So while he is still not a true believer, for what can be called a vested interest,he heads to Jerusalem. This becomes an underlying theme in the movie where Ridley wants to show that most men did not really know what they were fighting for and ultimately it seems as each man was fighting for either survival of for more power.Orlando simply does not have the physical stature and persona of a Russel Crowe or Mel Gibson but does manage to go about his job without much fuss. Sadly other characters are not well etched except for Saladin. The battle scenes, the forte of Ridley are engaging, though not spectacular. So i left the movie with one dominant thought that for once it is balanced view of historical events even though the accuracy was a casualty ( Balian according to more authentic sources was actually spared by Saladin in the battle) though cinematic excellence wise it will fade in our memories faster than you down your first beer after movie.",Kingdom of Heaven

374,soniagoenaga25,Very well made but clearly very partial towards the Muslims,4,5 June 2005,"I have recently seen 'Kingdom of heaven', film which I did not enjoy for one simply reason. It is very well made and the performances are extraordinary, but it has a very big mistake, the way in which it portrays both sides of the crusades. While the Christians are shown as beasts ready for blood, specially the Templars, who want power and hate the Muslims, without mercy, the Muslims are portrayed as the victims of the crusade. While the Christians never forgive the lives of the Muslims, the Muslims have mercy on their enemies and let them live. This is not accurate at all, neither the Christians were the beast this film try to show us, nor the Muslim were the good soldiers as in the film. I am not talking about a clash of civilizations, not at all, but it totally partial to say that the Muslims were the good ones and the Christians, with any exceptions, were the bad ones. It is not true because the Muslims committed many crimes on behalf of their religion. What I think is that Ridley Scott has made a political correct film in order not to hurt the Muslim community in Europe and in the rest of the world, and this is not good but it changes completely the story. Moreover, while in Jerusalem, there were no Jews in the film, something that is wrong because there were a lot of Jews living there at that time, so I do not understand the director's point of view. It could have been a very good film but due to the political correctness it has turned out to be a disappointing movie.

376,MrRazorz,"Overlong, pretentious and boring",2,9 May 2005,"As I write this review, I've just finished mailing an invoice to Ridley Scott. That man just cost me $15 and 145 minutes of my life, and I want them back. This overlong, pretentious and grindingly boring ""historical epic"" came dangerously close to being the second movie that I've ever walked out of. To give you an indication of just how bad it is, the first movie I ever walked out of was the godawful martial arts fiasco The Perfect Weapon back in 1991.We begin in France in the late twelfth century, one hundred years after Jerusalem fell to the Christians. An old crusading knight (Liam Neeson) comes back from the Holy Land to find his illegitimate blacksmith son Balian (Orlando Bloom) and talk him into coming to Jerusalem. Having lost his wife to suicide, Balian agrees to make the journey in the belief that asking God's forgiveness in the holy city will spare her soul from Hell. Although the fact that he's also wanted for killing the village priest probably plays a part in his decision.My advice: Enjoy the ""priest-killing"" scene. It's the only remotely interesting moment in the entire film.Travelling back to the Holy Land with dear old dad, Balian learns a bit about swordplay and knighthood along the way. He's also privy to pearls of wisdom from a succession of people including his father, a couple of priests and even the leprous king of Jerusalem. Clichéd and forgettable profundities such as ""By the decisions you make every day you will be a good man or not"" and ""A king may move a man, but the soul belongs to the man"" dominate the first half of the film. I half-expected a wrinkled green midget to shuffle up to Balian and tell him ""Beware fear, anger and aggression - the Dark Side are they."" In fact this might have been appropriate, since everyone from the king down seems to treat Balian like some kind of Chosen One, expected to single-handedly save the Kingdom of Heaven when he's spent his entire life making horseshoes.Eventually, Balian becomes a knight and inherits his father's title and land when the old boy karks it from a battle wound. He is given command of an army (despite the fact that he's only been in one battle - which he lost) and promises to protect the peace between Christian and Muslim. In fact the movie goes on at great length about brotherhood between the two faiths, even when they're hacking each other's limbs off. Hearing Muslims praying on a beach, Balian reaches the startling and meaningful conclusion: ""Their prayers sound like ours!"" Does the movie make a good point about religion here? Yes. Do we need it rammed down our throats with a stick? No thank you.Of course, all this is contrary to the war-mongering efforts of sneering bad guy Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas) of the Knights Templar (plot point: anyone wearing a white tunic with a red cross on it is bloodthirsty and evil) who considers Balian a ""Muslim-lover"" and an ""enemy of Christendom"". Having thus proved himself to be the politically correct good guy, Balian wastes no time in screwing Lusignan's wife while her husband's out slaughtering innocent Muslims.Surprisingly, even the sex scene is dull.Things get slightly less tedious when leprosy finally bumps off the king, Lusignan takes the throne and immediately starts the war against the Muslims he's been gagging for. Balian advises him to fortify Jerusalem rather than ride out for a scrap in the desert, but - foolishly ignoring the tactical advice of the blacksmith with the 0/1 record - Lusignan goes off anyway and leaves him to defend the city alone. Balian immediately knights every man within shouting distance and makes a few flowery pre-battle speeches which are badly-written and (thanks to Bloom) even more badly-delivered. The scene is thus set for the film's climactic siege, which manages to be unbearably tedious even though it borrows heavily from Helm's Deep and the Siege of Gondor. Maybe some oliphaunts would have livened things up.Honestly, I can't say enough bad things about this movie. It travels at the speed of an arthritic tortoise, tries to be deep but comes out preachy and self-righteous, paints Christians as inept bigots and Muslims as pious defenders of their faith (can't there be a few of both on either side?) and somehow manages to bore you to tears even with enormous battle scenes and a kazillion dollars worth of special effects. Oh, and Orlando Bloom as a leading man - I think that speaks for itself.Speaking about the movie on The Late Show recently, Bloom attempted to enlighten the world as to the remarkable parallels between the medieval Crusades and the modern War on Terror.

377,Beanamir82,Finally... a historic war film that keeps its end of the bargain!,10,29 October 2005,"I didn't have very high expectations for this movie, having been disappointed with Troy, and exasperated with King Arthur, and disgusted with Alexander. What a pleasant surprise! What first struck me, as other users have mentioned, was the incredibly two-sided views they gave of the Christians and the Muslims. People were not bad guys because they prescribed to one religion or another: they were evil because they misused their power, and were foolish. Even living in the Western culture that I do, I loved being able to deeply dislike several Christian characters in the film, and I felt only respect for the Muslim leaders--especially for Saladin, of course.Then, what continued throughout the film, and most impressed me, was the performance given by Edward Norton, my very favorite screen chameleon. I watched the entire movie with no clue who played the masked king of Jerusalem, and realized about ten minutes before he died, that whoever the actor was--he was wonderful. His entire face covered by a silver mask (except for a three-second flash which was clearly NOT the actor's real face), that character managed to evoke more of my emotions in his half an hour of screen time than Orlando Bloom did throughout the entire film. As I watched the credits at the end, and discovered Edward Norton in them... as the king... I realized just how much that particular performance had affected me. Even Richard Harris, as the comparable character in Gladiator, Marcus Aurelius, can't hold a candle to the way in which the King of Jerusalem was acted. (The fact that Edward Norton has never played such a character adds to the magic.) Of course Jeremy Irons and Liam Neeson played fantastic characters, but nothing spectacular, compared to some of the work they've done.I considered giving the movie only a nine out of ten, because of the Sibylla character. Eva Green was entrancing, but I just intensely disliked her character in the context of the film. But ultimately, I had to give the movie a ten out of ten just to raise up the paltry 6.9 average rating it has right now, because it drew tears to my eyes, and made me think. Everything was excellent, especially the casting, and the film is good enough to hold up as an model for other historic war films.

This I think is plain as advertised. What isn't plain is the dialog, the acting, the attention to the details of life as a soldier in those days and the cinematography. What more could you want? The story line was not as tight as it could be but then maybe that was a good thing. Life is not as tight as it could be. It is full of contradictions and change. The story line is how a man became greater and greater. It isn't about the Crusades nor is it a love story. Yet it contains those things. I think it can be very daring to not have a plain black and white story line ala John Wayne (no knocks but a good example nonetheless). The dialog and the acting were the keys to the movie. You can peer into the hearts of the characters and their actions did not contradict the characters. Yet their actions were not predictable. Their actions made sense with the characters. The movie itself is beautiful with many great vistas of different parts of the Meditteranean world featured in different seasons. Also the weapons of antiquity were very interesting. The movie was also fair to all people and religions. Some Muslims who were there shared that view as they were talking during their exit. The film showed the good ways and bad ways that people use religion. There were a couple of early scenes depicting some physically improbabilities but nothing too big to hold a grudge.For those who want black and white answers and yes or no questions, I would say that you will be disappointed.

I was not really expecting the movie to turn out to be a war based one, the detail of the war psychology and tactics seemed impressive. I would recommend watching this movie to have an understanding of how we perceive medieval war tactics themselves.I am not really sure as to how well the movie was acted out. Personally I felt that the performance was not that great and the part was over- played by Orlando Bloom and his character was too ideal and dry. Certain characters were dying out too abruptly though I would expect that would be a by product of having to squeeze a huge and consequential storyline into 160 minutes.Would have liked to see Michael Sheen playing a bigger part.Apart from the siege, Balian's engineering skills and ingenuity in improving his land was one of the better parts of the movie. Sad that that part could not have been elaborated, I felt that portion deserved a movie/documentary of its own.Overall the message was pretty strong and the strife between peace, politics and religion were well put, though I could easily see this storyline being extended to a series and the characters better played out. I would also add a few weaknesses and kinks in Balian's personality to make him seem more relatable.",Kingdom of Heaven
381,traveln1-1,Gladiator without training....meets Alexander disaster,6,9 May 2005,"The movie is well executed but the story as always in Hollywood these days left out so much to make Orlando's character unbelievable that you wonder if Ridley is smoking too many cigars laced with hash oil or if he edited out huge scenes to put in more fighting scenes that gets old after a few minutes. Needless to say the story moves at a Ferrari pace, attempts to cover way too much ground so fast that you never get a sense of feeling for anyone character development except a minor bit of Orlandos.Spoilers....Huge pieces are missing in the film.. like Orlando's father shows up out of the blue trains him for 2 fights and suddenly a blacksmith we know nothing about becomes Conan/Gladiator...then ends up taking a ship to Jerusalem that for some stupid reason goes under and guess what. he lands in perfect shape on the beach as the sole survivor .. but it gets better.. a horse survives also. Imagine that and it all happens in like 1 minute. Then he arrives in Jerusalem and not only becomes the golden boy of the King for just being his father's son but later becomes the protector of Jerusalem that defends it against the massive Muslim army.. with no training whatsoever.. maybe its me but hey.. did all blacksmiths have training in making catapults, advanced mathematics for land surveying war tactics and other advanced war tactics that make you think... did Ridley leave out an enormous amount of details on the editing floor or what but this kid is an instant superhero/Alexander? Regardless if he did add these missing huge chucks of common logic storytelling, the movie becomes a sort of Jerusalem becomes the Alamo only to end losing in the finale but he does show how the muslims were one of the most civilized societies during the Ottoman Empire ... at least that part was decent showing some gratitude to the current Israel/Palestine situation but the movie lacks so many pieces one can only imagine Ridley once again started shooting with no script like in Gladiator and this one fell apart ..everywhere... i hope I'm not the only one that felt this was a pathetic storytelling effort hard to swallow from such a great director.However, at least you will enjoy Eva Green yet unfortunately we also lose the r rated love making scene on the editing floor and Orlando does actually a pretty decent job but honestly.. why didn't Ridley get someone like Clooney, Clive Owen or a more mature star actor rather than this cherubish little boy that barely has the voice and body hair to even look like a man... once again another miscasting like Colin in Alexander.. Chris Rock has it correct. Hollywood.. just wait for a Star not some new up and coming young actor.. I wonder how many people will put this film down just like Alexander but at least its not Orlando's fault but Ridley's for not putting more effort in the storytelling.Hopefully this will lower peoples expectations but if you can swallow these huge missing chunks of character n story development perhaps you will enjoy the super long battle scened movie.. i give it a 6 but with missing pieces back in perhaps an 8.. in the meantime I will be waiting for the extended director/writer's version one day soon. :)",Kingdom of Heaven
382,Adriano_Galliani,Directors Cut is a MUST!,10,11 August 2016,"For two weeks now I've been completely obsessed by this movie. I'm not even a fan of these epic, historical titles, but just as Gladiator, this movie is anything but.Sure, it could be easily mistaken for one as it offers stunning visuals, historical facts and names, but straying from real events wasn't just in the way to make movie great - its more about facing the mistakes and learning a lesson.While it could be seen as anti-Christian and in some ways even pro-Islamic, that cant be further from the truth - for most part, Crusades were a farce, only few of them were there for a right reasons after all, and this movie points that clearly. Yes, it does portrait Great Saladin as this calm and tolerant leader, but it features some lot less too, and we see that he promised to conquer Jerusalem again, he even receives a threats to do so or else..So don't be confused - its one thing to criticize Crusades and other entire Christianity, which in no case is happening here.What else this movie offers? This incredible dreamscape of Kingdom of Heaven, a place to find yourself, your believes, your destiny! It showcases all these great mysteries of life and ideas of solving problems. From romance to courage, from honor to principles, it just works in deep, deep layers and it works days later after you watched movie.Soundtrack is just as brilliant, and listening to it afterwards just making you to go back to the movie.Casting wise, there's no mistake here, and Liam Neeson, Edvard Norton and Eva Green are on spot here. Heck, I even found respect for Bloom - hes doing just fine and one cant deny hes handsome and attractive.This is experience that you either will understand or you wont, its as simple as that. It works great as movie, but for me it goes a lot further than that - into this great possibility for eventual happier ending for Kingdom of Heaven. Its all about it - a place for everyone who are willing to accept everything and free will to decide it.",Kingdom of Heaven
383,Clossius,"not bad, but too many weaknesses to be good",5,15 May 2005,"KOH is not a bad movie, and it is entertaining, but just because it is better than Troy, Alexander, etc., it isn't yet good. (Gladiator was better, indeed; so were other historical movies with battle scenes, such as Braveheart.) The images are impressive, the special effects well done, and never mind the historical inaccuracies, such as that the Queen Isabella was in reality strongly on the side of Lusignan and Reynald Dew Chatillon and plotted against her brother as much as she could.The main problem lies in the Bloom character, mostly fictitious, who absolutely unbelievably develops from a French village blacksmith into a master strategist, military engineer, leader of troops, etc. This is not believable at all, and even if it were, no attempt is made to bring it off. The more ""senior"" Bloom becomes, the less believable he is.The religion issue is also a problem - not the display of the Arabs, about which so many commentators have fretted. They are shown as the pretty much better guys, more sinned against than sinning, which at that time and in that place, they of course were. No, the problem is that, for some politically correct reason (fear of some Christian organizations?), Christianity is played down, both in the ""good"" (genuinely motivating) as well as, but less so (see the Patriarch), in the ""bad"" sense. A Crusade picture without genuine Christianity is like, well, the Iliad without the Gods, but we had that, alas, also.The good actors in small sidekick roles (Neeson, Irons) don't help much; I think that the powerful role of Balduin IV would have been even more powerful without the removal of his mask. As for the battle scenes, again, they are indeed good, but in spite of all technological progress, not much better than, say, the 1968 ""The Last Roman"".So, in sum, not a movie to praise too loudly, but one could do worse on a rainy afternoon.",Kingdom of Heaven

Granted, Kingdom of Heaven is set in the holy land instead of eleventh century Spain,but this is basically a lovingly done update of Mann's EL CID; right down to a new age take on Chuck Heston's ""purest knight of all"" {a quote from both films}, who wanted the Moors{Islamists} and Christians to just get along. After ""Gladiator"" basically borrowed the plot of ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" right down to a Gladiatorial face off between Commodus and The Republican General,what's next? Is Scott going to re-shoot Winchester 73{Mann's classic western}. Don't get me wrong. I loved Kingdom of heaven {outside of unbelievable secular humanism spouted by medieval characters}.

Legolas was awesome, but it's time for something new.Moments of minimal dialog were interesting, but shoddy acting wasn't solid enough to bridge sizable moments of silence.

389,Rocking DH,Dances With Wolves goes East with a fresh face.,8,31 May 2005,"Orlando Bloom is out of the starting gate in his first starring/lead role as Balian, yet again a blacksmith (who convincingly hot shoes a horse)but this time in 12th century France. As the film opens, we learn that Balian is grieving the loss of both his wife and child, that his wife has committed suicide, and that the ""village no longer wants you here"". Strange counsel from one's parish priest, but perhaps folks in the middle ages were more superstitious about one so young having so much tragedy thrust upon him. Enter Godfrey of Ibelin, portrayed by Liam Neeson, who introduces himself as Balian's father. We watch Balian take this in as if swirling it in his mouth, tasting the idea, and feel that he is going to spit it out for the vinegar it seems to be to him. Not a line is said. But this whole concept is eminently portrayed by Bloom as if transmitted telepathically. I have not seen such acting since Spencer Tracey and Steve McQueen. Unfortunately, there isn't much time for father/son to interact, but there is enough. We see Balian decide to seize the opportunity for growth and responsibility that his father has offered. As the weight of responsibility and nobility is added to Balian's shoulders, he grows taller and straighter, steadier somehow. Balian makes his way to Messina, the port of departure for the Crusaders. The story follows that of a picaresque novel, in that the hero travels from adventure to adventure, situation to situation. Balian is shipwrecked and finds himself in the Holy Land. He rescues a black Friesian horse who escapes. He finds an oasis, and logically, his horse. This sets up an encounter with his first Muslim, Nasir. Nasir watches with respect as the young Balian's nobility grows as he reaches out to understand the strange culture that he is experiencing. A friendship and mutual appreciation is established that continues throughout the film. As Balian reaches Jerusalem and meets the Powers that Be--the Leper King and his sister--and the wannabes (her husband, Guy)--he becomes a chameleon, adapting sensible clothing for the blowing sand (neck and head scarves), melding into understanding the culture and people. Would that more folks would adopt this philosophy of life today versus taking umbrage for any reason and declaring war (the Templars and radical Muslims in the film). This is where the analogy to ""Dances With Wolves"" is tangible to me. A stranger in a foreign land, seeks to live as the natives, learn their culture and language, and in so doing, becomes a mix of cultures--a new being, neither of 12th century France nor of Jerusalem--but of mankind, understanding humanity. Balian resists the easy route to power and its temptations and decides to do what his dying father asked him to do--""Protect the people"". I found the soundtrack/Ibelin theme haunting and repeated listening reveals a richly interwoven tapestry of 12th century Christian sounds/choirs and period instruments alongside Eastern voices and instruments. Granted, scoring epic battle scenes is difficult, but the interposing of the choir vs. Eastern sounds seems appropriate. And the further the story goes, the more interposed/inseparable the two themes become...just as Balian's character is doing.In an interview with Orlando Bloom, a writer commented that Bloom's character, ""hardly speaks or merits any empathy in the first half of the film"". I would disagree. I recently saw a short on Steve McQueen on Fox Channel and it revealed that McQueen often had lines stricken because he could SHOW the information without having to explicate it with words. I submit that Bloom eloquently conveys Balian's feelings upon meeting his father, Godfrey of Ibelin, without a word--yes--he SHOWS it. There is not a doubt what Balian thinks/feels at that point. And Bloom does this repeatedly throughout ""Kingdom"". Often he looks out at the desert, the nothingness of its sands, the wasteland, the waste--then he may turn his head down, or glance quickly towards the camera, or look away in resignation. But the need for conversation or a character's line is not necessary. This 28-year-old can act, folks! Interestingly, at the end of the same article, Bloom mentions McQueen's techniques. Hmmm. Stay tuned to this actor. What a treat! Another treat was the perfect casting of Ghassan Massoud as Saladin. He showed the Muslim point of view--dealing with the fanatical clerics as Balian was dealing with the fanatical Templars--yet respecting the fallen cross and replacing it after Jerusalem had been reconquered by the Muslims. Both Balian and Saladin regret the loss of life, deal with the dead, and in the end, reach terms for their peoples. Also a standout is the priest/knight medic/Hospitalier portrayed by David Thewlis, who counsels and guides Balian and watches him develop. Balian has grown from a blacksmith to a noble ambassador. He mingles with the common peasants on his father's lands and strides the corridors of power with kings and bishops. Quite a range. Thank you, Orlando Bloom, for caring and doing a darn good job. Your professionalism, talent, and ability show throughout this film--and you are not mere ""eye candy"". Rather, I would say, ""food for thought"". Keep up the good work, please. And thank you, Ridley Scott, for giving Orlando Bloom his first starring/lead role in a very major motion picture with themes/content critical to humanity today.",Kingdom of Heaven
390,ZeryabFilms,Geographical and historical ignorance,2,10 May 2006,"The film is OK, but it displays Palestine (Israel) as a desert, and this is totally ridicules. I lived in this place for 33 years, and the location of the last battle ""Battle of Hattin"" happened near Nazareth my home town, and not far from the see of Galilee. First of all Jerusalem is not in a desert, the mountain were Jesus was crucified is called in Arabic the mountain of Olives. but in the film it have no trees at all. In the film the Crusades lost the battle ""Battle of Hattin"" because they traveled between Jerusalem and Damascus to meet Saladin, and lost the battle because the lack of water in the desert. well there is no desert in this area, and it is full of springs and small rivers. they lost because Saladin had a better army and a better leadership. In the film the Europeans are shown as superior to the Arabs, in History it is well know that the Arabs were superior (culturally and more civilized) and they don't need a European blacksmith's help to dig water, because they had better technologies and the water flows all around. Nazareth, Jerusalem or any part of center to north Palestine is not a desert, and it is agriculture green land. in Short showing a desert in this film is a Joke, because it is more than 100 Km away (about 70 miles) from any event that happened in the film And the big joke in my eye, beside the Geographical and historical ignorance of the film and the filmmakers, is the blacksmith that turned to a great leader, and a general in a very short time.Just look for images in the internet to see your self",Kingdom of Heaven
391,adamtanaka,a bland disappointment,4,21 June 2005,"Scott's long-awaited crusades epic arrives a major disappointment, a flat, sermonising and often inexorably dull adventure, it follows in the footsteps of similar disasters Troy and Alexander, possibly proving that historical epics, as a genre, may be well and truly dead.Of course, it being Scott, the whole thing looks very pretty, and the film's one exceptional asset is Edward Norton's leper king- but he's the only vaguely exceptional thing, and he dies half way through anyway. The script, in the end, is the main enemy here: bland, historically inaccurate and mercilessly sheared, with every scene ending suddenly as soon as it starts, it's filled with vapid dialogue and clunky set-pieces. Of all its flaws, though, there is one well and truly disastrous one- the characters, every single one, are paper-thin, and their story is stretched to say the least.Bloom's character, which we learn next to nothing about, is as dull as heroes get, Neeson's brief appearance as his estranged father (why they're estranged we're never told) rings hollow, Gleeson and Csokas' laughable Templar knight villains are just stupid- every single character is as shallow as a puddle, and consequently the film has no emotional pull whatsoever.And that, in the end, is the film's undoing; sure, the battles look nice (even though they're all ripped off from other, better films like Lord of the Rings), some of the sequences technically brilliant, and most of the performances adequate, but when we don't give a toss about anything that's going on, we quickly lose all interest.And, no, the gloating parallels it attempts to draw with today's heated situation in the Middle East don't work.

392,unklechunkle,It could have been SO much better,8,20 June 2012,"Fundamentally, the Crusades was a religious conflict between Christians and Muslims over the holy city of Jerusalem, so you would expect a film like Kingdom of Heaven to explore this deep rooted conflict in all its complexity. However, the film didn't quite deliver on what it seemed to set out to do. This film could have been a multi-layered historical epic dealing with love, war, religion and death but really only centres on the efforts of one man, whom I didn't really care a great deal for. The film does have its strengths, however, one of which is Edward Norton, barely recognisable as the disfigured King of Jerusalem. There are also good supporting performances from Liam Neeson, David Thewlis and an interesting role for Michael Sheen. Visually, the film is brilliant. Scott employs the style he used with Gladiator, including rich imagery in the form of falling snow. Take a look at at many of the scenes in the film and you can see they are not only rich in colour and vibrancy, but also detail.I think fans of films like Troy would enjoy this. Whilst it may not be rich in depth, it is an enjoyable enough action/adventure/historical drama",Kingdom of Heaven
393,ptb4life,One of the most underrated movies ever,10,12 July 2006,"First, a little background on how I watched this movie... I never saw the theatrical version of the film because I knew a director's cut existed, and that hopefully one day I'd get to see that. So the DVD finally came out and one night while I was having a few fun drinks, we decided to put in Kingdom of Heaven Director's Cut. We finished watching the first disk that night and to be honest...I was a bit too out of it to remember or understand it well. So a few weeks pass, and one Sunday night we decided to just finish up the movie and watch Disk 2. In all honesty, it was kind of like I never saw the first half, but that didn't stop me from becoming thoroughly wrapped up in the movie and enjoying it immensely. After finishing, I watched disk 2 a second time (with the director,writer, and Orlando doing commentary). And now this morning I watched the first disk so finally I could have the complete experience.So, onto actual movie eh? I really really liked it. It's the story of a man named Balian (Orlando Bloom). He is currently in jail for being ""possessed by the devil. His wife is dead (killed herself after her son was stillborn). Balian gets out of jail, and his long lost father Godfrey (Liam Neeson) makes contact with him. Balian takes over for Godfrey and is a knight sworn to protect the King and Jerusalem (Edward Norton plays the king). The King's sister (The gorgeous Eva Green) is in a loveless marriage to Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas...same dude who played Celeborn in LOTR!!!!!). He is a complete a-hole and only cares about being the next king. And when he is king he will end the peace between the Christians and the Muslims. Basically, this is the story of a Blacksmith (Balian) who becomes a great knight of Jerusalem, and the events that took place before the Muslims won the city back during the Crusades. That's enough of the summary for you....onto my thoughts.I really think I loved this movie. Orlando Bloom absolutely kicked ass in it! Everyone did as a matter of fact. It's a story of finding yourself, a story of religion, a history lesson, a love story, a story of amazing battles. Now I never saw the theatrical version, but while listening to the commentary, they spoke of the scenes that were new to this version. It baffles me that some of these scenes were cut out as they truly add to the story. The whole subplot involving Sibylla (Eva Green) is so very important in how and why the events unfolded the way they did...yet they weren't in the original! The movie really does an amazing job with making everyone seem human. I cared about these characters. Some of the decisions Sibylla had to make were really tough ones, and you felt for her. Even the Muslims in the film, who you would expect to be the ""bad"" guys...they aren't. Everyone is shown in rather fair manner...except for maybe the extreme Christians (Guy)...they are the real bad guys in this movie. The battles in the movie are quite simply some of the best ever seen (including LOTR). Whether it's a one on one battle...or a battle between a giant army, it's all amazingly well done. But a good battle means NOTHING if you don't care about those involved. That's why LOTR succeeded where a movie like Troy failed. Well, Kingdom succeeds in a big way! The music in the movie is also quite good. The film opens with a musical interlude that is quite pretty, and then at the start of disk 2 we get another nice piece of music. It's kind of set up like a play that way, unexpected, but welcomed! Throughout the movie the music is also well done....but it never quite reaches the awesomeness of LOTR, Gladiator or Star Wars. If I have any complaints about the movie it's that it is over 3 hours long, and while most scenes need to be there, some could have been shaved off a bit (such as him creating a water system). But that's not really such a big deal. Also, this is a movie that you really have to pay attention to fully understand how and why everything is happening (or maybe it's just cause I was drunk the first time I watched:) ) Some people have complained about the movie's ending. (SPOILER ALERT FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW HISTORY!!!!). How can you complain about the movie keeping the history true? A kind of truce was reached between the Muslims and Christians...sorry, one side didn't totally destroy the other side. It happens. Both sides had their own victories...deal with it. Overall, I found the movie to be educational, emotional, and exciting. I'm curious to watch the regular version...but I'm afraid it will spoil the wonderful time I had with the REAL version. So my advice to anyone who loved Gladiator or LOTR...Buy, rent, borrow this movie. It is a great film. A film that is better each time you watch it! Definitely one of the best films in a long while.9.5/10!",Kingdom of Heaven

I guess they made it work with ""The Gladiator"" but in that fictional account; there was a lot more time allowed for the character to develop. Here, Bloom's character would have needed a decade or more to realistically to go from the son of a Knight to a leader capable of pulling together the troops he commanded defending the city.

Gladiator was one of my favorite movies of all time, so it was natural for me to expect a lot from the legendary movie maker. Kingdom of Heaven takes place during the 12th Centurys first crusade. It's really about the legendary fight over Jerusalem, even though Balian's(Orlando Bloom) story has it's place as well. Orlando does a fine job I think. He by no means have the charisma of Russel Crowe, but he still does a fine job. I definitely don't think he is such a pansy as he was in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Black Hawk Down or Pirates of the Carribiaen.The action is intense. We get to see beautiful sword fights, huge catapults and lots of brutality as well as huge fights, between the Christian armies and the Muslim armies. Ghassan Massoud's(Saladin) performance truly stands out. So does King Baldwin's(Edward Norton).

The emotional bells however, don't toll quite so loudly as in the likes of Gladiator, but then this is a film with a bias towards external conflicts and concentrates on a larger headier, subject. I'm not sure quite why some reviewers in UK papers we're complaining about a lack of battle scenes. Maybe all the superficial, instant gratification rubbish they spew into society to sell rather than inform has taken it's toll, and dulled their minds. Or maybe they think their readers couldn't hack it, so alter their reviews. Either way they're missing the point. There's plenty of action, and plenty of story for those who care beyond their social schedule, TV programmes, and next fad. Completely fascinating, and socially relevant topic that perhaps in some way is a weight more than Orlando Bloom can carry, and for that some will scathe, but whilst his very subtle performance did not set the epic film world alight, it certainly didn't douse its flames either.

398,moonbootica,A rather good film,9,5 August 2006,"I really enjoyed this movie and was surprised it got slated by the critics, perhaps they did not like the message or seeing Saladin being merciful, who knows. It had excellent action sequences and the photography was amazing, loved the costumes and scenery as well. I mean there was a Battle of Hattin (1187) where Saladin captured the cream of European nobility which included King Guy of Jerusalem, as well as the True Cross, after the Bishop of Acre was killed in the fighting. Prisoners included Guy, his brother Amalric II, Raynald, William V of Montferrat, Gerard de Ridefort, Humphrey IV of Toron, Hugh of Jabala, Plivain of Botron, Hugh of Gibelet, and many others, this was a major setback for the Crusader movement and of course following that was the Siege of Jerusalem (1187) which saw the near total collapse of the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, and was the catalyst for the Third Crusade. So it was almost historically accurate (perhaps another reason the critics got all huffy). It was a great historical epic and I thought Orlando Bloom was not too bad as the leading character and Liam Neeson was very good despite his short time on the screen. So watch this movie, it will get you thinking of the past and the present and perhaps you will be more the wiser for it. Ridely Scott is in a different league to the directors of Alexander and Troy, which were both trying to be Gladiator but failed miserably.

399,imdb-10420,Fictitious licence combined with epic film-making,7,15 January 2007,"Most of those points are for the costumes and extras. And the CGI. I don't know about Bloom, he seems a bit skinny. Elfish, even (arrows fly in my direction).Although well researched, a lot of the individual character plot lines and factual basis of this movie are rubbish. Then again, as a whole, it does give you a fairly accurate portrayal of the period of the Crusades, the benevolence of Saladin (let's get this straight though - he engaged in just as much gore as anyone else at the time), the internal conflicts within the Christian brigades and the entire pointlessness of everyone trying to kill each other.For what? ""Nothing""; yet, ""Everything"", according to Saladin. Political gain through religious conquest. At what cost? Scott tried to pussy-foot around contemporary issues with this movie, but he needn't. It's a blood-and-guts epic very much in the vein of Gladiator and stands on those two feet alone (umm... those would be blood on the one foot, and guts on the other. Literally).Obviously he felt that he needed to tread lightly around the issue of the Crusades lest he offend someone. However I thought it interesting that he highlighted the ""killing a heretic is not a sin but will bring you closer to God"" thing, which makes me think about the various crusades of the current world and their various morals.But then again that's what he's trying to do, and entirely besides the purpose of this piece - and to be avoided in order to appreciate the cinematographic merits of this movie. It's a romantic re-invention of historical fact, worth enjoying for the grandeur as long as you appreciate the fact that it is just that - fiction, even if the names haven't been changed to protect the innocent.",Kingdom of Heaven

If you have nothing to do one evening and simply want to be entertained, this movie can fill the bill.It is hard to envision Balian (wimpy little Orlando Bloom), an illegitimate blacksmith, as the great warrior to rally the Christians in the Levant. The Templars, respected and feared by both sides, but truly not loved by either, should protest the impression left of their valiant monk warriors who, when captured, willingly accepted death rather betrayal and conversion to Islam. They may have sometimes been poorly led, but there was a reason why the Christians always sought the valiant warriors to ride in their vanguard and the Moslems, whenever possible, gladly avoided direct conflict with them. The Queen, Sybylla (Eva Green), could probably find a better adulterous lover than a scrawny blacksmith. So much for reality. But, in the politically correct world of Hollywood, the Christians were venal and grasping while the Moslems were brave and reasonable. Hollywood seems to have forgotten the Levant was Christian and/or Jewish for over 1500 years before the unprovoked Moslem attacks that led to the conquest in the 7th century.Oh well, a fun movie is still a fun movie. Don' waste time thinking about facts and real history, just enjoy the majestic scenery, the lovers, the well intentioned, leper King and the great battle scenes. Go be entertained and use this as an excuse to then go home and improve your mind by reading some real history about an era of great faith, great loves, valiant warriors (on both sides) and the bloody battles that left so many men (& women) of great faith (on both sides) dead or crippled for life.",Kingdom of Heaven
401,dejawolf,this movie is fackin awesome!,10,25 August 2008,"i've been holding back on watching this one for a while now. but now that i've watched it.. it might be one of those few movies i'll gladly watch again. lets get one thing out of the way first though, its not anally retentively historically correct, but the general feeling of the crusades is kept intact, and it certainly inspired me to read some more about balian of iberin. and what more can you ask of a historical movie. really..?it suffers a bit from what most historic epic movies suffers from, a somewhat compressed storyline, you can feel it stutters sometimes, and moves a bit fast in some sections, but ultimately it doesn't draw down the movie as a whole, as most of the characters are fleshed out just enough that you get a feel of their personality, even for the characters who only get a few seconds of screen time. another thing that i really like about this movie is that the battles are not muddled and confusing like in Alexander, where all you see is a lot of smoke, and some guy riding on a horse with a spear. they are much more brutal and visceral, and wonderfully choreographed. also, there's some classic medieval weaponry featured, and for those who've played medieval: total war 2, you'll certainly recognize it.oh and the characters are all immediately recognizable, as they each have a very unique and rich personality, and even if you only get to know them for a short while, you feel they have a weight of history with them, and feel a bit sad when they die.so anyways, if you liked LOTR, brave-heart and troy, i'd recommend you watch this one.",Kingdom of Heaven
402,scaves,Ridley Scott is losing his touch,4,16 May 2005,"I can't understand why Mr. Ebert would claim in his influential review that _Kingdom of Heaven_ surpasses _Gladiator_ in excellence, on the basis that this newer film has more substance and the character more motivation. In my humble estimation, there are few movies that can come close to the excellence of _Gladiator_ and its charismatic protagonist played by the charismatic Russell Crowe, not to mention the stunning private drama that that older film portrayed. All the actors in _Gladiator_ were superbly chosen for their parts: the indifferent parenting of the faulty Caesar Augustus; the weakness, cowardice, and incestuous self-centeredness of Commodus; and finally the dignity and integrity of Maximus that, when wounded, led to a fabulous story of revenge and honor. And what DIALOGUE! Where was any of this in _Kingdom of Heaven_? To be sure, Saladin was played by a marvelous actor, and there were some battle scenes to die for, but this film deeply disappointed me. First, where was the dialogue? It was much pithier in _Gladiator_. Where was the charisma of the protagonist? Orlando Bloom may be a fine actor some day, but he sure isn't Russell Crowe, and he played second fiddle to the mysterious and compelling King of Jerusalem, the leper in his silver mask. Liam Neeson upstaged him as well, which is why, I guess, he had to be killed off in the first quarter of the film. Where was the compelling love interest? It was much more interesting in _Gladiator_, and the woman stronger, more interesting, more complex, more devious, and far more threatened than this freckled princess who promised ""unpredictability"" but didn't deliver any. Where was the plot? It was crystal in _Gladiator_ and we didn't need subtitles to tell us where we were or what was happening. To be sure, KoH dealt with ""history,"" and Gladiator was fiction, but that rarely matters in the making of a good movie.Orlando Bloom seems destined to be in films that have big, ancient battle scenes, and the siege of Jerusalem reminded me, laughably, of the White City in _Lord of the Rings_ with the juggernauts coming and the catapults. There was Bloom, Legolas yet again, on the ramparts.Finally, what I disliked about the film, and what others have liked (granted, this is a matter of taste and ideology), was the preachiness of it. You found nothing of that sort in _Gladiator_, which was a whopping good story with a fabulous main character. People have gone on and on here about the moral integrity of this film that takes no sides in this fiction about the crusades but rather, delivers a perfectly contemporary and essentially cowardly ""historical"" recreation of a time that was religiously bigoted on both sides. Yes, there were opponents to the crusades; yes, there were many peoples trying to get along in Jerusalem. Yes, things were complex. But the film read like a contemporary social commentary on modern Israel. Who was it remarked that the flowery centerpieces and the cups of tea looked like little conference rooms? Essentially, however, Bloom as Balian failed to convince on all levels, and I was embarrassed by the sentimentality of the whole thing. As for the leper, and this is not much of a spoiler since readers tend to look mainly at the first two pages of this board, why couldn't his sister have honored his dying wish? That was a cheap film shot.",Kingdom of Heaven
403,film-11,An enjoyable film loosely related to history,7,7 May 2005,"Well, hasn't Orlando Bloom cornered the market in adventurous blacksmiths!!! Kingdom of Heaven is a really enjoyable film as long as you don't allow yourself to linger long on the historical or the credible. You are asked to suspend credulity as soon as Godfrey de Ibelin arrives on the scene and frequently afterwards - how does a village blacksmith become so soon both a master swordsman and a master of war as he is shown in the siege of Jerusalem? The film clearly is posting many messages for the present - both Christian and Muslim camps have hotheads who are ideologically hostile to the other, and unfortunately for the present George Bush is more like Guy de Lusignsan than like Baldwin IV.The film is very balanced between Christian and Muslim - which no doubt explains why both camps are unhappy with it. What the film really tells us, I think, is that in the search for God and meaning within the world in which we live, the answers that the established religions offer are all unsatisfactory. Balian is an honest, and perhaps too pure, hero who in the end cannot respect the reality of either Christianity or Islam.The film is broadly sympathetic to the historical reality of the period in which it is set, but the nonsensical democratic touches during the scenes in the defence of Jerusalem are wildly anachronistic.However, viewed as a stirring action movie (in the same way that one has to view Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"", for the same reasons) this really is a very enjoyable film. And the cinematography and special effects are outstanding.",Kingdom of Heaven
404,Akihse,Mildly entertaining mass murder,4,5 May 2005,"Balian of Ibelin (Orlando Bloom) tells us that we are responsible for our own souls no matter what the world forces upon us. Five seconds later he, ""the perfect knight"", throws burning oil on Saracens. Somehow the message doesn't ring true to me. Another problem with this movie is that director Ridley Scott wants us to think and feel that war is pointless. The reasons for going to war do not justify the horror they bring as both sides blur into a big mess of blood and metal. He goes about this by showing us battle after battle that makes you go ""Come on guys! Not again! This is pointless."" Although a commendable effort, unfortunately I found myself thinking the same about the movie. That being said, this could have been much worse. The battle scenes are visually impressive and the depiction of Muslims is surprisingly tolerant. Christian warmongers are the bad guys here. Kind of reminds you of today.",Kingdom of Heaven
405,annabrownie,An enjoyable film,8,9 July 2008,"Although this film does not quite compete with Gladiator in the epic stakes, Ridley Scott handles the subject of the Crusades with the same brilliance he brought to Ancient Rome.Orlando Bloom just about carries off being the lead in a major film. Certainly his performance here as Balian of Ibelin is a great improvement on his Paris in Troy. His development from country blacksmith to noble's son (albeit illegitimate) to defender of Jerusalem is well portrayed.However, the stand out performances in this film do not come from the lead. Liam Neeson is excellent as Balian's battle-weary father Godfrey, the ever-wonderful Jeremy Irons is superb as Tiberias, chief minister of the King of Jerusalem, and Edward Norton brings pathos and dignity to the role of the King, Baldwin IV, forced to wear a mask due to his leprosy. Equally excellent is David Thewlis as a Knight Hospitaller, favourably portrayed in comparison to the Templar order in the movie.The leaders of the Muslim army are portrayed with sensitivity and care. Saladin, in particular, comes across as noble, dignified and honourable, much more so in fact than some of the Christians he faces. This has basis in fact; some evidence suggests that Richard the Lionheart (who did not, sadly for Ridley Scott, require directions to Jerusalem from Balian, but rather travelled via Sicily) found his opponents more worthy of respect than some of his allies during his own crusade.The ""baddies"" of the film are not the Muslims who threaten the city of Jerusalem, but rather some of the ""Christians"", who desire war with the Muslims for their own purposes, and use the excuse of religion, and the support of fanatical religious men, to achieve their ends. Marton Czokas as Guy de Lusignan, husband of the King's sister Sibylla, and Brendan Gleeson as the hotheaded Reynald de Chatillion play these parts excellently, coming across as self-seeking, arrogant and dishonourable. To start their war they attack a Muslim caravan mostly composed of women, including Saladin's sister. When they ride out of Jerusalem into the desert to meet the Saracens in battle (many of their men falling by the wayside due to dehydration) they are conclusively defeated.It is left to Balian to organise the defence of Jerusalem. Ignoring the advice of the Bishop to ""convert to Islam and repent later"", he makes most of the men of the city knights, using the same words Godfrey uses to knight him earlier in the film. The battle and siege scenes are superbly shot. The parley between Balian and Saladin underlines how honourable these two men are in comparison to Guy and Reynald.While the romance between Balian and Eva Green's Sibylla is a little-needed and entirely invented subplot, the plot and characterisation as a whole are excellent.As with Ridley Scott films in general, the cinematography and sense of time and place are wonderful. Although this film, as I said earlier, does not quite measure up to Gladiator, it is still an excellent example of the epic genre and altogether an enjoyable film.",Kingdom of Heaven
406,rockdude-68045,Good in more ways than just action,9,10 December 2020,"This movie was surprisingly great! Orlando Bloom did a great job and the storyline itself is really interesting. There's a lot more to this movie than simple heroic adventures because it dives deeper. It's refreshing in what it covers ( Religion, Crusades, Politics, Traditions, Relationships, Change, and a strong individual who upholds his core values). The movie offers some subtle life lessons if you pay enough attention and within its details reveals a lot about the characters and their motivations. It honestly could be re-adapted into a series at a slower more detailed way that could still hit all the climatic elements and ultimately the conclusion. Instead you get it all in a movie but there's a lot of range involved in it. As a bonus it's got some great war scenes the absolutely delivers on the action!I really liked this movie and after watching it over the years I've grown to love it. I highly recommend watching it.",Kingdom of Heaven
407,fvikingo,Long and boring,5,10 September 2007,"I'm just writing because I disagree with every review I've read. This movie is really really long and it gets boring as hell. I actually fell asleep after the first two hours and had to watch it the next day. I love this kind of stories, and I don't like when I see a good argument implemented badly. Also, Orlando Bloom doesn't seem to catch up well with being the main character... lacks charisma maybe. Also, the movie didn't make me feel anything, and as for the story, the information it gave was vague and I could get it more precisely and better by reading 15 minutes. So it's long, boring, doesn't transmit feelings nor knowledge. I don't plan on watching this movie ever again, and it was a bad experience when I did watch it. The 5 stars are only because is history, and that's always fun to watch... but just once and with popcorn, chocolate and maybe someone at your side, so you can chat while the movie goofs around.",Kingdom of Heaven
408,Bojo375,Cheesy nonsense with some neat crowd scenes,6,25 March 2021,"I reviewed the director's cut in hopes it would change my lukewarm opinion from having seen the shortened version on release. It's certainly longer, and less choppy I guess, but at its heart it's still a silly boy-fantasy about magical, unearned specialness. Often unbelievable and even insultingly paternalistic (the locals seriously need Orlando Bloom to show them how to find water in the desert?) the film tries and tries to prove how even-handed and thoughtful it is by stating in one speech after another how even-handed and thoughtful its good-guy characters are, meanwhile handicapping the bad guys with simplistic motivations and the stupidest decision-making process on earth.Bloom is a weak lead and simply can't carry the film. Many of the other actors though are quite good. And of course it looks pretty great. Lots of extras (real and digital) make for some nifty battle scenes, so if that's your jam and you're not too demanding in your screenplay needs, you might want to check it out.",Kingdom of Heaven
409,bprokosz,Review is for Director's Cut only,10,9 September 2011,"The theatrical cut of this film runs 45 minutes shorter, has a different color pallet, is missing a few subplots, certain characters just go away and you never know what happened to them, the ""bad guy"" is one of those, he's just out of the movie all of a sudden...in short, it felt chopped and unfinished...The Director's Cut is THE best work Ridley Scott has ever done...yes Blade Runner is considered his masterpiece but I disagree.The music, color, set design, dialog, action, momentum, EVERYTHING is perfected. With the extra 45 minutes we get a completely told journey that actually stays with you after the film is over..due in part, to the outstanding score.Orlando Bloom is actually able to carry the film, plus the secondary characters are ALL wonderful actors who do an amazing job as well.Add to this the incredible 4 disc DVD set with an insane amount of special features like roundtable reads, interviews, behind the scenes, etc, including talk with Scott about how he really hates that the studio made him cut down the movie.It also has a musical intro like when a theater is filing in, an intermission, and the discs are perfectly cut so the scene fades slowly between Act 1 and 2...If you like anything epic or just like any of the actors don't bother renting, just buy the 4 disc DVD...the Bluray looks and sounds great but sadly there are no special features.",Kingdom of Heaven
410,kristian-bakdal,good yet disappointing.,8,2 May 2005,"First of all let me just say that this is a good movie. That said it was also a disappointment to me. That sounds like a contradiction. So lets start with the movie and get to the disappointment later.First of all it's set in a period with knights and squires, and it's been a while since we've had any descent movies about those guys. Then there are the epic battles, you can't really make any movie anymore with out a big epic battle at least not if it involves a army of any descent size. Another thing that was great to see was the the Arabs were not portrayed as the only fanatics, in many ways I found myself sympathetic with them then with the Christian people in the movie. The actors were good especially Eva Green and Ghassan Massoud (the rest were good two, I just found myself liking them more then the rest).Of course the cinematography was great as I expected from a man like Scott. And this is what leads me to my disappointment.Ridley Scott has always (as far a I remember) made different kinds of movies. So even though the movie was completely different in content the his previous movies, the way it was filmed and the score was very close to another movie he made not so long a go (Gladiator). This was disappointing to me as I had expected him to surprise me yet another time. That said Kingdom of Heaven is in many ways a better movie then Gladiator and had it been made made by anyone else but Ridley Scott I would unconditionally say that it's a great movie.",Kingdom of Heaven
411,ak_stinger,Historical epic hits the right notes,8,12 May 2005,"""Kingdom of Heaven"" is a movie that admirably balances the difficult portrayal of the Muslim/Christian conflict that was the Crusades. There were complex characters who wanted to do good for everyone on both sides - Saladin and his commander; Balian, Godfrey, Tiberias, King Baldwin, etc. These people were devout in their faiths. The bad guys, Reynald and Guy, showed the dangers of using faith as an excuse for ambition.Orlando Bloom performed well in his first leading role, having grown up a lot since his ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" days - I'm eager to see him starring in a more modern film! This is definitely his first ""man"" role and he does great work with the material Liam Neeson was excellent as always and Ghassan Massoud as Saladin had a lot of depth.My complaint is that the movie tried to tell two stories instead of one - Balian's journey from bereaved peasant to lord and protector of the people AND the historical war. Both were balanced pretty well - in the hands of a less capable director and less talented actors it would have been a mess - but if it had focused primarily on Balian's journey the film would have been more powerful.All in all, I would recommend this movie to people who can handle violence (it is a war movie and the camera doesn't pan away when blood is spilled) and a world that isn't black and white (the viewer is able to see both sides of the conflict, especially the final siege - we're not meant to see a ""good guy"" side and a ""bad guy"" side). It's a very good study of an area of history that needs to be re-explored in light of the current state of affairs in the world.",Kingdom of Heaven
412,soldaten116,Kingdom of Boredom,7,24 November 2005,"First off let me say the trailer for this movie had me so jerked up for a movie about the crusades I probably set my expectations too high. That said KoH is a worthy effort and I admire Ridley Scott for tackling this era of humanity. There are few offerings in this genre. Don't count the Rings trilogy or any other fantasy movie. This was a movies based in a real historical context.So I gave it a seven for the visual experience. This was amazing. The costumes and cinematography were wonderful. This move made it on eye candy alone.The acting and story line, well that's the hit here. Orlando Bloom just doesn't have the screen presence needed to pull off his character. He's supported wonderfully by a great cast but I just don't buy his portrayal of the blacksmith turned Baron. It's not all his fault, the writers didn't provide him with a convincing storyline either. Speak of which, the story just didn't move very fast or smoothly. I wound up just not caring about half the characters, especially the Queen.The last portion of this movie I found disappointing was it's portrayal of Christianity. For me, I thought it was wholly unfair. Every religious figure in this movie is a coward and everyone either loses their faith or uses it to gain power. They were burning Nobles and peasants alike at the stake for heresy at this time. Everyone gets away with blasphemy and heresy all throughout this movie. I just found it unrealistic and more of a modern view on religion that back in 1183. In Medieval times, religion was everything. Christian or Muslim, you just didn't speak out against it, at least not in public in front of everyone. It ruled their lives and caused unspeakable brutal acts to be committed true enough, but I felt its portrayal here was a bit slanted.The amateur historian in me enjoyed the experience. Its one man's version of the crusades and you could make any number of other ""personal"" visions of this era in time if you wish. This is definitely not a date night movie or something to impress your religious in-laws with. Watch it with guarded judgment and you'll enjoy it for what it is.",Kingdom of Heaven
413,BenvanKayz,Pretty Good,7,2 December 2005,"'Kingdom of Heaven' was pretty much exactly what I thought it would be, a long entertaining epic movie with good scenery and special effects. But i wasn't expecting it to be so hard to follow.The beginning of the film was promising and almost similar to gladiator in a way. But after the first few scenes i found myself getting lost in the plot. I had no idea what was going on. You would probably have to be an ancient historian, or at least have a lot of previous knowledge of the crusades and Jerusalem to know exactly what was happening, but it was still entertaining.The film continued like this until about the last half hour where it became pretty clear what was happening. The battle scenes were well done and highly entertaining. I couldn't help but notice the extreme similarities to 'Lord of the Rings: The Retern of the King' though.Orlando Bloom is surprisingly good in the hero role, and all of the cast fit very well into their roles. The score by Harry Gregson-Williams is excellent too.Overall, this film is pretty entertaining and full of beautiful scenery and some great battle sequences, although a little hard to follow. 7/10.",Kingdom of Heaven
414,stevec-35,Gritty realistic view of the Crusades,8,5 May 2005,"Coincidentally, I saw this movie just after viewing El Cid on DVD. Both are great movies but El Cid presents a more sanitised view of the middle ages. Kingdom of Heaven presents the period with the gritty realism that is much more common today. The colour is rather drab and the lighting in many of the interior scenes is rather dim which may have been the way it really was but can be slightly frustrating at times.The story follows Balian (Orlando Groom) who begins the film as a village blacksmith in France and winds up as a landed knight in the Kingdom of Jerusalem who plays a major part in defending it from the Saracens under Saladin.I'm a stickler for historical accuracy and as far as I can see, this film gets it almost exactly right. All the historical characters from the last years of the Kingdom of Jerusalem are there. The tragic leper king, Baldwin IV, the evil Reynaud De Chatillon who more than anyone else was responsible for the fall of the kingdom and the beautiful Sybilla, the eventual queen.I couldn't fault the acting. All the characters, both Christian and Moslem, are very convincing. The battle scenes are very well done and, on the whole, I liked this movie better than Ridley Scott's last epic, Gladiator.Kingdom of Heaven has been criticised for being biased toward the Moslem view of the crusades but, like it or not, this is the way it happened (see Steven Runciman's ""History of the Crusades""). The moral of the movie is as relevant today as it was then. All it takes to destroy a peaceful relationship between two nations in the middle east is the presence of bigoted people on either side.Highly recommended for lovers of historical epics and anyone who likes a good story that is free of car chases and explosions.",Kingdom of Heaven
415,steffiebaby140,Blurred polarities,7,7 May 2005,"I found Kingdom of Heaven to be a delightful ride down the moral pathway. Unlike most ""war"" type movies that are out there the good vs evil people isn't all that clear. You can really see where both sides are coming from and sympathize with their plights. Ridley Scott has done a fantastic job of drawing you into the character's lives and making you care what happens to them. I found myself completely flummoxed as to who I should root for. There was quite a bit of blood and a little gore, but it is a movie about the Crusades, so what can you honestly expect. Orlando Bloom does a fabulous job of bringing the character of Bailian to life. There were, however, a few very sappy moments, that made me want to gag up my popcorn. But overall I thought it was a wonderful film that explores the motivations of really good people, and the lengths that one will go to in the name of religion. Plus, I'm a huge Edward Norton fan, and he does a spectacular job playing King Baldwin!! So I am giving it a well-deserved 7, which I usually do not give. I tend to be very critical about movies, and don't enjoy too many.",Kingdom of Heaven
416,mezi304,Exquisite,10,7 June 2005,"Expecting a movie about history was worrying in case it was misinterpreted, then to add religion to the mix was terrifying (especially in a time like this). But Ridley Scott done a exceptional job and this is from a person who did not like Gladiator. His direction was excellent, each scene, shot , pause had a truth to it i cannot explain. The second the movie started i was warped into the 12th century. I felt the injustice of the era when the priest stole Balian's dead wife's cross. A simple crime summed up the entire confusion of religion; people who follow religion for a greater purpose and people who follow it to a certain point until it does not suit them. This was done towards the end when the Bishop suggests to convert to Islam and repent later to avoid any pain the Muzlims could inflict on them. The movie uses more small moments to communicate greater truths. For example when King Baldwin and Saladin meet at Karnak they treat each other with great respect and Saladin informs him that he would send his physicians to help the king. A few words and already the audience understands how wonderful both these kings were. At the end when Saladin picks up the fallen crosses and places it on the table was a moving scene. It's nice to see a movie that shows boths sides of the story. There are many favourite scenes of mine and it will take days to list them all down. However the scene which gives me hope about the world's future is the one between Balian and Nasir at the end. their friendship and respect for each other was to be envied. The best acting was done by Edward Norton, Jeremy Irons, David Thewlis, Liam Neesona and Ghassan Massoud. Each of them were very deep in the little time they had on screen and real as real can be. But Edward Norton I must give extra credit because he worked his magic through a mask and he was the one who brought tears to my eyes. I really do hope he gets nominated for an Oscar. Anyway i advise everybody to go to this movie no matter what religion or culture you are but i do advise that to be too critical will ruin not only the experience but the message of the movie (which is different for everyone).",Kingdom of Heaven
417,phillawrence-32142,Directors cut a must,9,26 May 2020,"The extra hour of the directors cut provides so much more depth to the epic movie. so much more makes sense. The studio should be ashamed of themselves for such a butchering.The battle scenes are a spectacle as are the images of old cities such as Jerusalem, it is like being transported back, in time which is exactly what you want for this kind of film. Whilst I think Orlando Bloom was miscast in this role. he does an OK job, but the rest of the cast are superb.One slight nitpick would be that I think the director was a bit generous to some of the Muslims and Christians, in terms of honourable conduct and Jerusalem being a peaceful city being home to all faiths, but perhaps that is more accurate than I realise.Nevertheless, a must watch for history fans.",Kingdom of Heaven
418,Bigfootballfan,The Definitive Crusades movie,8,17 November 2006,"Kingdom of Heaven is an absolutely spectacular action/adventure movie. The battle scenes rival that of Peter Jacksons LOTR trilogy. Both sides Christian and Muslim are well-drawn in an objective manner. The cinematography is lovely with some footage rivaling that of Lawrence of Arabia. Orlando Bloom is perfectly suited to the spiritually conflicted hero with complex views of life and death. Ghassan Moussad is uniformly perfect as Saladin, the Muslim King. It lacks a little depth in its characters and some of the dialog is somewhat redundant and plastic. But its always fascinating and terrific with an engaging story and engaging characters. It's political message is simple without extremists on both sides Christianity and Islam can get along pretty well. Definitely worth a buy! (Go get it Now!)Note: I also have seen and purchased the Directors Cut. Its much better plugging in all the wholes, better character development, and just all around great. Instead of just an action/adventure film its a religious experience and that earns it the title of masterpiece. A perfect 10/10 for the Directors Cut. Bravo, Ridley Scott, Bravo",Kingdom of Heaven
419,Duk,"excellent, fair to islam, sweeping, narrative could have used tightening...",8,7 May 2005,"I really enjoyed this movie. The way the movie started in Europe and how dark it was there... and the journey to Jerusalem... just wonderful stuff up to that point.Liam Neeson, as usual, is just SO GOOD, you wish he had more screen time.Orlando Bloom, actually surprisingly, was able to carry the movie as a lead. I was surprised he had the heft to do it, but I agree with the critic who said that the beard helped. He was a man, not a boy.Battle scenes... incredible. I was really surprised that they could wow me, since we've been numbed by the quality of battle scenes in so many previous movies, but they did a great job.Portrayal of the Muslims. EXTREMELY fair. In being ""even-handed"" to Christians and Muslims there, if anything, they emphasized the Christian fanatics (in the form of the Templars in particular, to simplify things) as being the ""badguys"" more than anyone else... (which is historically accurate to some degree, in my understanding). I was surprised and pleased that they tried to be accurate, and didn't try to emphasize some ""BAD MUSLIMS"" to make it ""even"".Movie is very secular in it's moralizing.And it portrays Christianity particularly religious men, VERY badly (the Priest who steals the cross from Bloom's wife's corpse... the Bishop in Jerusalem who's ready to convert to Islam at the first sign of defeat... and who also wants to abandon the civilians... the knights templar...) I thought this got a tad gratuitous. There were really NO GOOD Christian FIGURES IN THE MOVIE. The only good purported Christians were basically acting Agnostic (Bloom, Neeson, etc.) The actual religious Christians were made out to be hypocrites.Meanwhile Saladhudin was a man of honor.. but also somewhat moderate.Movie could definitely have a little more narrative focus and maybe have a little more of an emotional circle for Orlando Bloom character. The emotional arc is ALREADY complete fairly early in the movie (Bloom becomes a man of conscience)... and it's kind of boring since the character doesn't really move after that.But the movie tackled a HUGE topic and tackled it fairly well. I just wish there was a better script to handle the compelling personal journey for Orlando Bloom (from widower, murderer seeking redemption, lost bastard son) that was PROMISED at the beginning.It seems that as soon as he brings water to his father's old land, he's just about done his journey, and it turns into a simple historical battle movie. (but a darn good one)",Kingdom of Heaven
420,The Mogul,"A Beautiful, Saddening, Existential Challenge: Religious Zealotry Through History's Lens **Review of the Director's Cut**",8,2 February 2006,"**NB: This is a review of the director's cut. If you find Kingdom of Heaven's plot difficult to follow, or if you find its characterisation shallow (some common criticisms of the film, although I can't say how true they are), you may not be watching the same movie. Forty-five minutes makes a big difference in these terms.**This film is a rich and beautiful tapestry. It depicts a timely story without the clichéd heroics or naïve politics that have characterised other recent Hollywood histories. It similarly steers away from the sword and sorcery aesthetic, which held sway in King Arthur for example. Every set, every costume, feels authentic; the production design is simply fabulous.The Cinematography, too, is exquisite; the desert becomes a place both mysterious and treacherous; its colouring is magical. The heat is somehow made visible, but even so cool respite can be found in palace chambers, or between the amphorae of Jerusalem's larder.Kingdom of Heaven sports a large cast, but its actors and Monahan's script combine to bring surprising depth to a host of roles. One doesn't often feel that one knows so many characters in the wake of so little screen time.Edward Norton and Ghassan Massoud, opposed but philosophically aligned kings, are a fine example of this. Both convey a gravitas that hovers over the film even in their absence. Massoud burns up the screen; Norton's portrayal of the leprous King Baldwin is just as masterful: he manages extraordinary pathos, without ever removing his silver mask!Liam Neeson's noble father looking for redemption and a legacy; David Thewlis's practically compassionate by-the-wind-sailor; Jeremy Iron's pragmatic humanist; Alexander Siddig's student of justice; Marton Csokas's vile, hubristic warmonger; and Brendan Gleeson's blood-mad oaf  all are fine portrayals.But perhaps most entrancing is Eva Green's Princess Sybilla. She wafts through the film like sublime incense: a single fragile feminine scent always close to being overwhelmed by her emphatically male and martial world. Her beauty and royalty afford her power that she is nonetheless too timid to use. In her presence we feel the touch of her courageous brother's shadow, and her guilt at his suffering in her stead; we also feel her fatalism and her passion for Balian, her contradictory enchantment and weariness with the East. All of this comprises her beguiling character: a fine performance indeed.The only principal actor to have escaped my praise thus far is Orlando Bloom in the lead role of Balian. This evasion has been deliberate: Bloom is perhaps Kingdom of Heaven's only serious weakness. His performance is not bad, he meets with some success, but he doesn't seem to grow over the course of the film, even though the script demands it. He is most disappointing in his orations to the defenders of Jerusalem; he just doesn't have the charisma to fill his hauberk. (One can't help but make negative comparisons with more inspired battlefield talkers, such as Crowe, Branagh and Gibson.) Whilst Bloom's performance makes this film less than a masterpiece, it is, nonetheless, a very good one.Requiring further comment is Kingdom's accomplished screenplay, which deftly avoids didacticism and over-simplification, whilst still offering an accessible parable for today. The disjuncture between doctrine and religion's core values; the clash between zealots and humanists within the same faith: these are the real conflicts which sustain today's intractable religious wars, and they persist on both sides of the affray. Kingdom of Heaven skilfully crystallizes these problems and puts them in historical perspective.Some have criticized this film on IMDb for its supposed historical inaccuracies, but such critics need to consider whether Kingdom of Heaven was ever intended to be a true story or, rather, just a truthful story. Just because a film is set in the past doesn't mean it can't be a fiction. Whinging about departures from actual history with respect to Baldwin, Sybilla, and Guy de Lusignan, is ludicrous. Did Gladiator's protagonists follow their historical trajectories? No. But that does not make the film unreal! A film can be a fiction and still be true to history. The key criterion, unless a film claims to be a true story, is not did such events happen, but might they have happened.Another popular criticism of Kingdom of Heaven is that Bloom's character (supposedly) learns swordplay and statesmanship overnight. However, such detractors haven't thought for a moment about the length of the trip from Britain before motorised transport. Just what do you think Balian would have done along the way with an eminently wise father and his retinue of veteran crusaders for company? This is saying nothing of the considerable time which elapses in Jerusalem.Kingdom of Heaven is not an episode of 24; its timescale is one of many months. A diet of unsubtle action flicks seems to have neutered some viewers' capacity to imagine temporal shifts!With specific regard to weaponcraft, Balian is shown to be accomplished with the sword when he first joins Godfrey. European knights never had anything like a monopoly on swordplay; is it all that surprising that a weaponsmith knows how to use a weapon? Such knowledge is in fact essential to the occupation!Any lover of history and beauty should not miss this film; any humanist will be saddened by its story; everyone should find some excitement on its exotic streets, or if not, in the midst of its brilliantly executed battle scenes.",Kingdom of Heaven
421,kg61410,Lacks in everything the Gladiator might have shined on,3,9 May 2005,"I found The Kingdom of heaven to be an utterly disappointing movie. The plot being heavily copied from the excellent novels by Jan Guillou (the middle one in the crusade trilogy mainly) I had high hopes.We follow the implausible story of Balian, a blacksmith from France turned Baron, hero and lover. How all this comes to happen is not quite explained, I suppose it happens at times when the camera is looking elsewhere. It surely doesn't happen when Balian in being filmed, such leaps does he take as a person. While character development is something most films lack in, an unfounded, undeserved development is no better, quite the contrary.Have you ever seen so called epic films where the hero is bashing away and the camera films in silence? At at times it shows us the heroes crying in solitude? When we never hear the sounds of battle? Just see the hero with his sword, giving and taking hits? And what is this usually backed up with? Chanting -style music, possible with pan fiddles and the like. Expect to see some of this when you waste your admission on the kingdom of heaven.Have you ever known these trusty sidekicks in films, who take the hero for a god? Have you ever seen them jump at the last bottle of water in the middle of a desert, instead of giving it to the hero? Have you ever seen the sidekick utter anything that doesn't concern the hero as his last dying words? Well don't expect to be too surprised here either, we see some sidekicks being brutally killed already in the beginning defending someone they don't know. Being a sidekick must be tough.How do you carry a plot? How do you explain the things that are going on to the viewer in a clever, yet not too obvious way? Well, you certainly should rule out having the hero have dialogs with his sidekick, who naturally is totally in the blue about what is going on. Oh sire, why do we not fortify this wall?? My trusty, though foolish sidekick, why it is so that they would break in here, so we could smash them here. Oh, thanks.As for casting, well it's just plain OK. I don't like Bloom too much here, he's got that aura of a fool a bit, he's just not the serious person he tries to play. Sibylla is just another female lead with not much to say or do. The king is played well by Norton, though the mask makes his life that much easier. I particularly liked the Syrain Actor casted for the role of Saladin - now if only they would have found something alike to play Balian.Please check my vote history to see how I liked other films if you wish. I just rate this along there with Godzilla, King Arthur and the like. Crap.",Kingdom of Heaven
422,Kavikulaguru,Very Good movie - worth a watch,9,8 May 2005,"Ridley Scott has made movies like Gladiator and Black Hawk Down. Admittedly, both these were superior films than Kingdom of Heaven - but it would be unfair to compare this movie to Scott's previous ones - movies like Gladiator are like Ben-Hur - the perfection of these classics simply cannot be repeated. However, when one views KoH without the baggage of the past - it is an imminently watchable movie. The battle scenes are brilliantly shot - and the characters are all too human - with enough grey shades to hold your attention. Apparently the Christian right is not too happy with the presentation of facts here - but they must realize - movies are meant more to entertain than to introspect. As an entertainment movie, this one absolutely rocks - nowhere in the movie is it stated that the depictions are historically accurate. As it is, the crusades can hardly be described as a high point of Christian history.",Kingdom of Heaven

And i have to admit after watching it i was really disappointed , and i regret wasting my time on it . first of all the screenplay is very weak , and Doesn't fit well with the movie and the time of it's events . But the worst thing in the movie is the Horrible Acting , especially by Orlando bloom who couldn't succeed in his part at all . Ridley Scott was good .. But not as good as i hoped , of course after seeing gladiator , black hawk down , blade runner , Thelma and Louise ...etc , you expect something huge but there wasn't anything special in this movie .

424,Scotty7777,Excellent acting and intense drama makes this a great outing,10,9 May 2005,"Orlando Bloom and Liam Neeson are both outstanding in their roles but I have to say the person who stole the show in terms of screen presence, touches of humour and good acting was Alexander Siddig. Siddig (best known as Dr. Bashir on Star Trek: DS9) plays an elegant and principled aide to the Muslim leader Saladin, but his part is actually the most prominent among the Arab characters in the film. Massoud is also excellent but Siddig is the one who shows that both sides had people who were intelligent and principled. On the Christian side of the conflict, it is Balian (Bloom) who gives the Crusaders dignity and intelligence, although Ed Norton as the king of Jerusalem is also an exemplar for how things should be done in order to extend the peace.My entire family enjoyed this film and we will be back to see it again! Don't miss this!",Kingdom of Heaven
425,andyk888,Masterpiece.. Just make sure you choose the DIRECTORS CUT,10,11 September 2014,"Firstly I think its important I mention that there are two Kingdom of Heaven's and that they are entirely different films. I first watched the theatrical version and whilst I loved the film, it was obvious that it was missing a fair bit of weight. The theatrical version is like a trailer for the directors cut, it shows most of the key bullet points yet it doesn't fill the holes nor does it do a good job at conveying the overarching morality of the characters and the plot.Kingdom of Heaven (DIRECTORS CUT) is without a doubt one of the most beautifully made and crafted films from the complex crusade era. It intertwines the wintry scenery of England with the barren aridness of Jerusalem and yet all the while you are not being influenced by the scenery but rather the morality of the characters who travel through Europe in search of their own purpose for life.Orlando Bloom nails his role as a broken hearted son who is given a 'second chance' by his high statued father. The director does very well at illustrating Orlando Blooms sin whilst making it clear to the viewer that this is a man who inherently would choose to make the world a better place. There are incredible cameo's from a host of lesser known actors (David Thewlis and Jeremy Ions) and Eva Green is absolutely captivating and layered in her Queen of Jerusalem role.The film is full of strong acting performances backed up by a very thoughtful script. There are some conversations between characters that will make you want to review the entire film again just to revisit the sheer poetry in the dialogue. I feel like the film does a very good job at sending the viewer back to an earlier time, and the costume/sets are outstanding.10/10. Do not miss this epic. Just make sure it's the DIRECTORS CUT",Kingdom of Heaven
426,jlw96,Ugh! Major letdown! Wait for DVD release....,4,9 May 2005,"My friends and I saw this stinker on opening night fully expecting such greatness as was found in Gladiator and Black Hawk Down (or at least I thought those movies were great). Instead, we ended up moaning over the fact we contributed our money to support another slapped together totally uninspired snooze-fest.First of all, I do claim to be a fan of Mr. Bloom. Secondly, I think he should stick with playing the sidekick and leave the leading man roles to those capable of carrying a movie. I think that would have helped KOH in my opinion. Somebody like Christian Bale (who really knows how to beef up!) or Sean Bean (maybe a little old but they could have gotten somebody else to play his father other than Liam). Orlando is simply too puny to realistically portray a blacksmith. Yeah, he did it in POTC, but that movie was a fantasy and not reality.Since I don't know how true the historical aspects of the movie really were portrayed, I won't criticize those elements, but I think if Ridley wanted to do a movie about the crusades, surely he could have chosen a better storyline? I mean, wasn't there something about a children's crusade? Now that might have been interesting...Other than Mr. Bloom, I think the rest of the cast worked for the movie. If only the plot, editing, dialogue, etc. etc. had not sucked maybe this movie wouldn't have been so bad. I mean, we are supposed to believe that Balian all of sudden knows how to kick ass and plan strategic warfare? Must have been all that knowledge acquired from Lord of the Rings. I thought those siege towers and cavalry charge looked awfully familiar....",Kingdom of Heaven
427,RoaringFourties,Not accurate but entertaining,7,2 December 2005,"Let me start with three important points:1. The Muslims are not monsters. That is good because there were not then. And are not today.2. The templars are the Über-evil bad guys. That is bad because they were not.3. There is such a thing as history, but not in this movie.If you know the history of the crusades, this movie will disappoint you. Keep in mind that this is a Hollywood production and you cannot expect too much.There were some issues that began to really irritate me as I was watching this flick.It began with killing the priest and then going to Jerusalem to repent. In the process they kill off characters you would like to have seen in the rest of the film. Balian sleeps with his enemies wife, knows he will start a war but becomes religious or something and will not avert the whole tragedy by agreeing to have the bad guy killed. And the king won't avert the tragedy by killing the bad guy on his own. Great. In the desert, the templars drop from thirst and a day later others go the same distance and don't. What gives? And why did they not show the battle but only a bunch of bodies laying around after wards? Aside from some irritating details, this movie has some pretty good combat. The acting is great, although some dialogs are too long. The editing is OK, except for a couple of scenes where things were obviously cut that should not have been, such as the burial scene where Saladin prays where editing resulted in a Muslim burial that would not be acceptable to Muslims.Aside from being a bit long winded in some scenes, this is an enjoyable movie. I give it 7 out of ten. Certainly worth renting.",Kingdom of Heaven
428,wolfeE-leet,You will waste your time,3,11 February 2014,"This is my first review ever on IMDb. Each time I watch a movie or television show I come to IMDb and read both positive & negative reviews for it. I highly recommend doing so because it allows you to in many cases fully understand or enjoy the media even further, as I've learned many things and insights that I would have not have known otherwise.Kingdom of Heaven in a nutshell is a large trash heap dressed up rather nicely. I rate it 3 out of 10 mainly because the costumes, lighting, sets and scenery look very nice and immerse you into the sun-caked realm of Jerusalem.From the beginning you are lead to believe the main character will perhaps rise to greatness but he neither rises nor falls. He simply exists. Many nice words are said or small anecdotes on good living, but beyond that there is literally no point or conclusion of the story.Ghassan Massoud as Salah ad'Din is breathtaking and he shows real charisma compared to Bloom who sounds like a teen boy.In conclusion, Kingdom of Heaven is a three hour snooze-fest that will not impact you in any way except wanting to purchase some of the very nice costumes the actors wore for your next Halloween party.",Kingdom of Heaven
429,Isaiah53-1,Historically and Theologically Inaccurate,2,18 May 2005,"This movie epitomizes the 'secular humanist' slant of history that is often portrayed in Hollywood today. Imagine if you will, those of you that know anything about history, that a young peasant living is a small village in Europe would be elevated to lord and defender of Jerusalem. Further compounding the problem is that the only 'hero' in this movie (Bloom) is agnostic at best. The Muslim invaders are portrayed as kind and honorable while the Christian defenders are depicted has vile, hateful, war-mongers. Typical Hollywood. I also took issue with the blatant attack upon the Catholic Church, it's clergy are either cruel or inept; ready to abandon their faith at the first sign of trouble. While Bloom's character is the only one with any sense of intelligence and an ability to ""do the right thing""come on give me a break. I am sick and tired of Hollywood's overt attack upon Christianity in general and this movie adds fuel to the fire. If you have no care about historical accuracy or if you have no faith in anything; go and see this movie. If not, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. 2/10",Kingdom of Heaven
430,Steven_Hibs,Good better than Expected,7,10 August 2005,"Ridley Scott is well known for epic movies, Gladiator and Alien. Kingdom of Heaven is now on that list. The action takes place in the 12th Century 1186 to be exact. At the time of the Crusades. Orlando Bloom plays a blacksmith, Balian, whom has just lost his wife and child and the Godfrey of Ibelin has come to tell him that he is his father and asks him to travel with him to Jerusalem. Balian does not want to leave especially at time of such grieve. But he travels with them to the Holy land where he believes he can erase his sins.Balian becomes a great knight and becomes the Godfrey of Ibelin as he seeks his way to the holy land. Upon arrival he encounters Tiberias, his adviser. Balian falls in love with Guy De Lusignan wife, Princess Sibylla, grows into a leader, and ultimately uses all his courage and skill to defend the city against staggering odds.This is a good movie, action scenes do not come as often as you wish. Especially about midway through the film about 200,000 people per army get ready to fight, and eventually agree terms to which would disappoint the viewer, and when the action scenes come round they are great.Ridley Scott creates epics and the scale of the movie is just that. Orlando Bloom holds the lead role well and the other actors put in good shifts. This does not disappoint.",Kingdom of Heaven
431,simonf,"The movie is a disaster artistically, and just a notch above disaster",3,15 May 2005,"Major spoilers follow.Most of the characters act badly, including Bloom, and horrible direction makes things even worse. The movie resembles a comic book in that everything is done in the same tone and color, and the viewer is dragged from one scene to another which show what he is supposed to feel, only it's impossible to feel anything except for utter bewilderment.That said, Saladin is very impressive, a wise, cunning, but humane figure. Some supporting characters are alive, but the main love line (completely fictional) is done horribly, horribly wrong. I felt no sympathy for the heroes, nor understood their motivations.Now for the historical part.BLACKSMITHS ARE NOT ABLE TO FIGHT MOUNTED KNIGHTS, USE SWORDS OR PLAN FORTIFICATIONS!!! A knight was trained in his art since early teen years! Balian was a few decades older at that period, and he was never a blacksmith or out of touch with his father. Balian, as well as Raymund of Tripolis (called Tiberias in the movie), *did* take part in the battle of Hittin, and not cowardly sat it out. Balian never planned the defense of Jerusalem, and his contribution to the relatively peaceful surrender was much cooler and more dramatic than shown in the movie - he came in to fetch his wife, promised Saladin that he won't help the defense, but then, asked by desperate citizens, went back and asked Saladin to free him from his vow, who nobly agreed to. Needless, to say, Balian never went back to France or had a relationship with Sybilla. Baldwin IV, the leper king, died a few years earlier than shown in the movie, was mute and blind by the end of his life, and he would not be able to wear a metal mask in the Palestinian heat. Finally, Richard the Lionheart did not pass through France on the way to Palestine, he went by sea through Sicily (land travel was much more expensive). According to military experts, the armor, clothing, weapons and siege procedures are highly inaccurate. Eg, you don't have just thin flimsy gates in a castle, because then they would be broken down immediately. You build narrow defensible passages inside towers.",Kingdom of Heaven
432,exarch3d,Dire!,3,18 May 2005,"I only went to see this because I'd been having discussions with people about how it would portray the Muslim side. Turns out it portrays the sides pretty evenly, but that the film is a long, dull, disjointed, cliché-filled mess. Bloom is OK as Bailan, but you never really get on his side. The fact he becomes a master swordsman after a 2 minute lesson is impressive though!The plot has every cliché in the book (short of making him an ex-navy seal), yet you still never really care about anyone or get drawn in. The SFX are good, and I hoped that the battles might save it, but its hard to believe they are from the same guy who did the great Gladiator... they have no flow or rhythm and are just a jumbled mess.

I would have liked to see more personality of Orlando bloom's character Balian, but that is not Blooms fault it's the director's fault. Bloom is pretty good,actually. But it's not all bad, the action scenes are very good and the film is worth seeing for just that. And it's beautifully filmed.

If 'Vikings' was run for the first time in Australia on 'The History Channel', then so should have been 'Kingdom of Heaven'. There's enough blood and violence and explicit sex scenes to keep even the most jaded history student on the edge of his seat. And this movie is truer to real history, according to Wikipedia. Well now, that's ninety percent of the requirement and I've hardly started. There I was, in the backblocks of France, minding my own business, slaving over a hot blacksmith's forge, when along comes this knight: Liam Neeson, who says he's my father. (Thank Christ it wasn't Sean Connery. At least we can understand what this one is saying.) Anyway I go over to Jerusalem and see this nice little raver (Eva Green) with the bluest of eyes and the prettiest of English accents. But she's a Muslim, more's the pity, and they're ten-a-penny around these parts, even today. So what's changed: Well they've all got perfect teeth in the twelfth century at the crusades.

436,charliecrack,The Crusades,8,26 January 2013,"This film by Ridley Scott seeks to make sense of an incredibly complex period in medieval history. Rather than a black and white version of Muslim Christian relations,he seeks to show the complexity of the politics of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.Both parties are guilty of barbarism and surprizing sophistication in their dealings with one another.As Jerusalem is wrested between Muslims and Christians there is an astonishing empathy between them. Both know the importance of the Holy City to each other and both respect that.Saladin is portrayed brilliantly by the Sudanese born actor.I read the eminently readable ""Jerusalem"" by Hugh Montefiore who interestingly enough comes from a Sephardic Jewish family and this I felt filled in any gaps I may have had in the history of this period especially concerning the strange and romantic figure of Baldwin IV The Leper King of Jerusalem.The portrayal of the Knights Templar as the shock troops of the Crusaders eschewing the quasi mystical reputation that they were to achieve later on in their development was a nice touch.For those who can grasp the fanaticism of medieval religions and the vital importance of Jerusalem as the centre of the medieval world this film is a real treat.It is curious that the power of the story of the Crusades still haunts both Christian Europe and the Islamic Middle East, indeed Osama Bin Laden often considered American and British incursions into the Middle East to be Crusading.Ridley Scott never fails to satisfy in my opinion and though this film wasn't a box office success in America, it was in Europe and the Arab Middle East which is interesting.",Kingdom of Heaven
437,TheRedViper,An Under-Appreciated Masterpiece of the 21st Century.,10,5 December 2015,"I think it's necessary to begin this review by saying that I've never seen the 144 minute Theatrical Version of this film, but I have seen the 190 minute Director's Cut of this film three times. As with Scott's 1982 sci-fi classic Blade Runner, reception of the original release of the film was very mixed. The Theatrical Cut of Kingdom of Heaven was an all-too short action-adventure movie with some romance thrown in. The Director's Cut is an epic of religion and war in the 12th century, exploring deep themes such as religious conflict, man's role in God's world, and the difficulty of deciding between what is easy and what is right. Unfortunately (but understandably), the studios didn't much like the sound of that last bit, and so they demanded Scott severely edit his own masterpiece for mainstream audiences. Scott has since disowned the Theatrical Cut and calls the Director's Cut the ""definitive version"". And it is. Kingdom of Heaven is a historical epic over three-hours long with dozens and dozens of characters, and it's a masterpiece.I could list all of the things that are great in this movie, like the beautiful, vibrant and heart-rending cinematography that paints France in deep, chilly blues and Jerusalem in warm, lush shades of orange, red and yellow. I could talk about the score, which is beautiful, tragic, stirring, epic and reflective in equal measure depending on what is needed in the scene. I could mention how excellent the cast is, with every role occupied by the only actor that could have done it justice. Particular stand-outs include Edward Norton as the melancholic and reflective leper king and Jeremy Irons as the weary but honourable marshal. And finally I could talk about how skillfully William Monahan balances the epic with the quiet, the intensity with the calmness, and most intelligently depicts neither the Christians nor the Muslims as right or wrong. They both have their redeeming qualities as well as their historically accurate drawbacks. Saladin and his army may be the antagonists of this film, but they are not the villains. A lesser screenwriter and a lesser director would have made them one-dimensional villains, but Scott and Monahan depict them fairly and respectfully.But what I love the most about this film is how it makes me feel. It's an adventure, but not a light, shallow one. It's an adventure of self-discovery, of honour and loyalty, of sadness and regret, and finally of some form of redemption and validation. This film covers the breadth of human feeling in its three hour runtime like no other film I can think of in the 21st century. This isn't just Ridley Scott's masterpiece, this is also one of the best films ever made, in my opinion.So if you are going to watch this movie, do not watch the rushed and shallow Theatrical Cut, watch the epic and magnificent Director's Cut.",Kingdom of Heaven

Historic personages (including the main character) are either poorly represented (again, like the main character) or represented true to their actual counter-parts (such as Saladin, famed and respected amongst the Crusaders for his chivalry and fairness).The movie makes no pretensions concerning the notion of ""good"" or ""evil"" religions or motives, which unfortunately either mire movies in ridiculously PC ""just like us!"" nonsense, or portray Muslims as bloodthirsty lunatics.In the film, they are neither. Christian men fight with and without honour, Muslim men fight with and without honour.All that politicking aside, it is the extended director's cut which is most worth watching.

It was an epic (and fictionalized) account of historical facts... but still great. On the level of Gladiator. But it seemed chopped in some parts. It was still great though. And Kingdom of Heaven became one of my favorite movies ever.But a few months ago, I heard that Director's Cut, around three hour long, was a masterpiece. And sure it was!!! It was too difficult for me to find it but I finally saw it this weekend and my reaction was even better that when I saw the Theatrical Cut my first time: gorier, clearer, more character development, more tragical... and an amazing final duel that you surely will never forget. This film, if released this way, could have not been a box office success... but could have earned Ridley Scott and William Moynahan a couple of Academy Awards more.This is definitely Ridley Scott's latest masterpiece, even toping Blade Runner and Alien!!! 10/10",Kingdom of Heaven

Wrong film at the wrong time.I'm really not into the tinted film with slow motion thing. Films should be clearly lighted and the characters in clear view even in bad weather. If I want to see arty stylistic lighting with characters I can always go to the art gallery.The Crusaders were backward, just coming out of the Dark Ages and poverty in Europe, seeking plunder. The Arabs on the other hand were civilized and modern for their time. The Crusaders in the 1st and 2nd Crusade attacked and genocided Muslim Arabs, Arab Christians and Jews, and not as the film portrays do social welfare work on their conquered Arab lands. The Crusader look too good as savages for that time, and the Arabs well as Arabs from Hollywood.Saladin was Kurdish and a good deal of his army consisted of Turks, so the portrayal of his army is inaccurate. In addition I doubt Saladin could muster an army of 200,000. His army was 45,000 max, facing a crusader force of about 30,000.Mr. Scott propagating war, and for what? For who?

I found that the entire experience left me cold. I find myself not caring about Orlando Bloom. He just didn't project any charisma at all. It's like he telephoned-in most of his performance from the Keanu Reeves School of Dead-Eyes Acting. At almost no point during the entire film do I find myself getting interested in whether his character lives or dies. The one exception being nearly 2 hours in when there's a face-to-face meeting with Saladin (Ghassan Massoud). For a tantalizing few moments, there's some chemistry! Thank God for small mercies! With Sybilla (Eva Green), the nominal love interest, nothing, nada, rien, zippididoodah, SFA! On an emotional level, there just isn't anything to cling to. To paraphrase a line from Amadeus, people aren't interested in stories about Gods that look like they're going to sh*t marble. Thus the problem with Kingdom of Heaven. If I had to isolate the shortcomings to one area, I'd say it's the script. There's just too much glanced over. You don't even get the Coles Notes (Cliff's Notes for those south of the 49th) version of what's going on and why I should give a d*mn about the significance of what's about to happen. And a couple of technical gripes: A:) The tight-shutter shooting during the battle scenes that gave Savin private Ryan it's distinctive look. There it worked because it was imaginative and conveyed the staccato nature of perception in high-stress situations. Here, overall it almost never works. The one exception that really worked was a shot that started off in real-time, camera pans over to Oralando Bloom for his reaction which is in slow-motion, and then proceeds back into real time. Quite effective in that instance only. The rest of it? been there, done that. B:) Attention DOP John Mathieson. Panoramics are lovely. But let's not make a movie of them no matter many extras the director's managed to array. Anyway, enough rant. This film just isn't up to normal Ridley Scott snuff. Rent Gladiator or Kenneth Branagh's Henry V if your looking for scale and human interest in one package. Kingdom of Heaven just ain't it.",Kingdom of Heaven

A CGI cast of thousands.Saw this at a preview. At nearly 2 1/2 hours it is a long ordeal followed by a run for the exits.The plot: Feudal lord reconnects with long lost/abandoned son before he dies. Son takes up where his father left off defending Jerusalem. Virtuous son knocks boots with wife of future king, staves off attacks by Muslims and saves the day. And remains true to himself.

444,newtonooi,Good but could have been better,6,9 May 2005,"The name Kingdom of Heaven (KOH) refers to the city of Jerusalem, and what many of the movie's characters want it to be, a city where people of all faiths can live in peace and harmony. The irony is that nearly all of the main characters commit various acts of sin, some atrocious and some just regrettable. Here in lies the inspiration of the story; flawed men (and women) who strive for an ideal and in doing so do things they would normally never have done. This conflict is hinted at in various points of the story; such as when Tiberias tells Balian of how he came to Jerusalem for honor and glory, and ended up fighting for land and wealth. But, this conflict is only hinted at, when it should have been the dominant theme of the story, and because of this, KOH is just a good action movie along the lines of say Indiana Jones or Clash of the Titans, when it could have been an awesome drama epic in line with Lawrence of Arabia, Bridge over the River Kwai, etc..This is probably the biggest letdown of the movie: the storyline, the setting, and the religious/political environment were ripe for creating an intensely interwoven drama. Instead, the movie became more about the journey of one man, Ibelin, from tragedy to glory and then a new life with a ex-queen. And to make matters worse, Orlando Bloom did not have the dialog or screen presence to carry this of.The second letdown was the music. The music was okay, but for a movie like this, it should have been great. It was often times repetitive and nothing stuck in my head after the movie finished and the lights came back on. I appreciate the fact that a lot of the music was Christian / Arab folk or liturgical music, but for the battle scenes, you need a great orchestral score. John Williams should have been the composer for this movie.The third letdown was the dialog. For a movie loaded with experienced actors like Jeremy Irons, Brendan Gleeson, David Thewlis, and others with decades of acting experience, there was way too few words. Remember that these were knights and nobles, and back in the Crusades' time, knights and nobles were fairly well educated and could do better than utter 1-sentence lines. This lack of dialog was especially noticeable for Balian, the central character. On top of this, the dialog was in modern English with just a lot of references to God in it. Kenneth Branagh does a better job (on a smaller budget) in recreating Old English in his movies than KOH. This is truly disappointing considering the effort spent on recreating the costumes, weapons, castles, roads, and everything else in this movie.The last big letdown was the Saracens speaking English to each other. What is this!!? They should have been speaking Arabic (with English subtitles) in every scene except when conversing with the Crusaders. If Mel Gibson can fund an entire movie where everyone is speaking Aramaic, Latin or Hebrew, then Ridley Scott and 20th Century Fox can surely make a movie where all the Saracens speak Arabic.Four letdowns equate to four stars docked of 10 for me, resulting in a six out of 10 stars rating from me.",Kingdom of Heaven

447,ric_pineda,"Will of the free. Scott-Free, that is.",7,18 May 2005,"Director Ridley Scott has the power in today's film-making to do whatever he wants. Spielberg, Cameron and Lucas join him in this prestigious selection. No wonder. He is the man behind the great ALIEN and BLADE RUNNER, and enjoyable features such as GLADIATOR and HANNIBAL.Filmography aside, he gives us KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, an epic story of the Crusades when Catholics and Muslims started the fight over the land of Jerusalem. A two-sided tale of man and conflict, a theme he previously explored in the much superior THE DUELLISTS, his feature debut.Some has been said about the neutral standpoint of KOH regarding both parties at war in this film. I wonder what an interesting gimmick could've been done with the Muslims leading the story, just for a change. But that is just me.Scott's craft in films is impeccable and this is no exception. Expect great costume design, set decorations, sound, cinematography and visual effects. Everything is in place. I do have to agree with another comment made in these same pages, though: the editing. It didn't put the story in motion as it was supposed to, there was no rhythm in this movie. A zig-zag of high notes and low ones.The cast was acceptable. Bloom was OK, nothing great. He has an impressive resume for a young body of work. Good to see Irons back after a while and Neeson is usually welcomed. Ghassan Massoud wore Saladin like a glove. Favorite character to watch: the silver-masked king! The Crusades can be easily recognized (much more now) as a major influence in Lucas and Tolkien when they were imagining STAR WARS and THE LORD OF THE RINGS, respectively. For moviegoers, history suffers from fiction in this case. Ironic and a bit unfair, but that's the way it is. And, of course, add the aforementioned movies with BRAVEHEART, GLADIATOR, TROY and Alexander. The genre is wearing itself tired and repetitive.KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is not a bad movie. I found it entertaining and fairly done. Not in the level of what you expect from a much-talented movie-maker, but still a piece that carries his remarkable trademark.",Kingdom of Heaven
448,daniel-desilva,A graceful Hollywood blockbuster filled with compassion and inspiration,8,8 May 2005,"A powerful, new film seizes cinemas worldwide as Kingdom of Heaven is released to the awaiting public. Directed by the master of the modern epic, Ridley Scott has proudly created a film about war and peace within the troubled twelfth century. Flanked by a host of talented actors such as Orlando Bloom and Liam Neeson, this film struggles to avoid comparisons with Troy and Alexander. Both classics were released recently sharing similar violent battle scenes bringing our fascinating history to life. This graceful Hollywood blockbuster takes us on a journey of relative peace between the second and third Crusades, when the Christian knights of Europe took up arms against the Moors of North Africa for the Holy Lands. It focuses on the story of Balian Of Ibelin (Orlando Bloom), a young peasant who rises to knighthood and then finds himself drawn to the people of Jerusalem's cause. The story opens, with Balian, a French blacksmith, mourning the death of his wife and young son. It is then that Godfrey of Ibelin (Liam Neeson), a highly regarded baron to the king of Jerusalem, and a man deeply committed to his mission of bringing long-term peace to the Holy Land, comes in search of his illegitimate son Balian, in the hope of giving him some comfort during his time of grief. Godfrey is hopeful that Balian will join him in his quest, but Balian, consumed with grief, cannot think of helping others find peace. All this is soon about to change however with his father's untimely death. Will Balian be able to lead an army against the evading forces and claim victory for a worthwhile crusade that will win a special place in heaven? I was astonished by the acting talent of Orlando Bloom, a man that will always be forever known as Legolas in the Lord of the Rings and cherish a place in the history books of Hollywood. Below is a fearless quotation by Bloom as he addressed his armies as they defended Jerusalem. I recognised a tremendous amount of passion in a truly gifted actor. ""Be without fear in the face of your enemies. Safeguard the helpless, even if it leads to your death; that is your oath. Rise a knight, rise a knight!"" Other actors that should be credited as knights in shining armour were Liam Neeson and Jeremy Irons as they created promising performances. Finally, I can predict that this film will cast a competitive shadow of many future films this year boasting a stunning backdrop and magical set pieces, which are enhanced, but not dominated, by computer-generated effects.",Kingdom of Heaven
449,kevacho,Scott rules...,7,9 May 2005,"Ridley Scott is the master. He is my favorite director, bar none. Arguably, Scott has helmed the greatest horror movie of all time, Alien, as well as the greatest science fiction movie of all time, Blade Runner (whose special effects, sans C.G.I., rival those of such visual fodder as the Star Wars prequels and the last two Matrix's). Here's the thing about Ridley Scott he has had an incredible career spanning over three decades, with such films as Legend, Gladiator, White Squall, G.I. Jane, Thelma and Louise, Black Hawk Down, and The Duelists (just to name a few), Scott has shown himself to be an artist of the highest caliber. The fact that Hollywood has thus far shunned and denied these attributes and achievements, even going so far as to ""snub"" Scott an Oscar for best director when both his movie- Gladiator- and his actor- Russell Crowe- won, is and forever will be irreprehensible and unprofessional in the extreme. There is something in every single Ridley Scott film something beautiful, something magical, something astonishing, something stunning. His films are feasts, visual pictures that move across the screen like the brush strokes of a brilliant painting, or like the choreographed fight of a Shaolin monk.With all that said, ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is not my favorite Ridley Scott film. Is it worth seeing? Yes. Is it worth the price of admission? Hell yes! Is it Scott's best movie to date? No.As it concerns ""Kingdom of Heaven"" I wanted more: more passion, more intimacy, more story, more character depth. I enjoyed the premise, and I think rediscovering the lunacy of the Crusades is a wonderful thing. I liked how the script took a strong, close look at religion and the turmoil and dread that always seems to follow, or rather, precede, it. I really liked the films strong anti-war sentiment, and of how ludicrous it is for men to fight and die over a piece of land; the same piece of land that, to this day, zealot men are still fighting and dieing over.However, there was a lot about the film that felt familiar, and not in the best of ways. The first few scenes with the snow floating through the air were a directly facsimile of Gladiator's first few scenes. The enormous, epic battle scenes reminded me of every single enormous, epic battle scene I have ever seen, from Brave Heart to Return of the King to Alexander. I don't really know what happens with those battle scenes either but somewhere along the way, as thousands upon thousands of men topple off battlements and die screaming beneath burning oil, I lose some of my interest. It's almost as if they themselves, meaning the battle scenes, lose aspects of their intimacy and humanity, like a musician who prefers playing smaller clubs than huge amphitheatres. The epic battle scenes are the amphitheatres- enormous, impressive, but somehow distant, the fight scenes between a few men are the smaller clubs- easier to follow, and more detailed and close. There is a fight scene at the beginning of ""Kingdom of Heaven"" between 7 to 15 men that is much more thought out, much more emotional and impacting, and much more fun than any of the other epic scenes. I think the eye and the mind can only take in so much at one time, and I also think that is why Gladiator worked so well; the fight scenes were, for the most part, man on man, which lent to it an air of closeness and confidence that those epic battle scenes could never hope to achieve. You felt like you were with Maximus in the arena, fighting against tyranny, fighting for the honor of his wife and child.""Kingdom of Heaven"" is a good movie and worth paying to see. Yes the script could have been written better (albeit there are some wonderful lines), the battles scenes are over the top, and some of it appears as if Ridley Scott is emulating Ridley Scott, but it is also beautiful and horrible and breathtaking. Orlando Bloom becomes a man in this film not the waspish, soft-spoken elf, or the insipidly weak Troy royalty, but a man, capable of leading kingdoms and conquering armies. My only thought is that ""Kingdom of Heaven"" needed more substance and more depth. I liked it. In fact, I'll probably see it a second time, but, as stated before, it did have and air of familiarity that was not necessarily good.",Kingdom of Heaven

The armies looked extremely well and very well coordinated. The other good part was the fact that this movie does not take sides in the war. We all know the story and for some it may seem that the crusaders did in fact have God on their side or not, anyway as I said the movie is trying to be objective and its nice to see a different perspective. What I didn't like so much was the fact that, at one point, the movie lost its ""documentary"" nickname, if I may say so, and started to make a one hero movie.

It's one of those stories in which the events are placed in a time in history, but everything else about it is made up. No need to go into any more detail than so many others have about the politically incorrect people, places, circumstances and events--it all serves Ridley's idea of the way the world should work, not the way it really is, ever has been or ever will be. People who like this movie, and even many who don't, also rave about the ""beautiful cinematography."" Well, most of that cinematography is digitally rendered, and much of the movie is shot against a green screen (like 300). How much more beautiful would it have been if filmed on location? Jerusalem--the real place--and the surrounding area is some of the most varied and beautiful terrain you'll ever see, but the movie rewrites the geography so that you have Jerusalem set next to an impossibly flat and featureless plain that runs for 100s of miles in all directions--stupid.

I thought ..o.k it's free and said yes.I have never been bored so badly that I wished that I has stayed at home.The characters were good, all that you had to do was look at the cast of actors. I must admit that I did have my reservations about Orlando Bloom, but he did a good job of it. My hat's off to you. But in saying that you never felt that they were actually interacting with each other. They didn't seem to have any affect on each other. it's strange but they managed to pull it off.The direction was good, it wasn't brilliant, it was just good. But the best direction was the battle scenes.The script was minimalist.The Muslims were portrayed well, as they should be. They were the superpower of that time. I'm not versed in the fall of Jerusalem but it seems historically accurate; but I am open to correction.What was the most disappointing thing was the length of the film. It was far too long. The setup of Balian (Orlando Bloom) is done twice and it just waists time and you loose interest. The father/son relationship between Godfrey (Liam Neeson)/Balian (Orlando Bloom) is none existent and the fact that they have just met and Godfrey raped his mother isn't explored at all. Balian kills a priest and of we go to Jerusalem. I'm just impressed that he knew where Italy was (was till you see it, you understand). The relationship of Balian and Sibylla is build over a cup of water and has only one scene to advanced it. Nothing that is discussed in that scene if followed through, but they still end up in bed.Relationships are setup and then forgotten. People seem to react to nothing, King Baldwin (Edward Norton), who is a leper and is dying, - I didn't know it was him till now - doesn't kill Guy de Lusigan (Marton Csokas)on the word of Balian (Orlando Bloome) even though they all know that when Guy becomes King, because he's married to the Kings sister Sibylla (Eva Green), the fist thing that he is going to do is attack the Muslim and destroy Christian Jerusalem. The templers are the only ones that have any kind of motivation, crude and simple as it my be.There was one unintentional comic moment. Balian (Orlando Bloom) is talking with Sibylla (Eva Green) about why she married Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas) who is the bad guy, so Balian asks ""..was Guy forced upon her"", The thing is that Guy is pronounced Gee and in Ireland Gee is slang for....well....a woman's genitals.

More importantly, the actings are pretty good, so is the directing.I particularly like the message the movie intends to send out (or I think it intends to send). Religious bigot and zesty are often disastrous, and taken advantage to lead to some disasters. Probably in a pretty religious society of U.S. today, it is not a popular message.

Although not all of us agree on some issues regarding the historical accuracy, I think the movie did its best in portray the emotional and religious importance of ""Jersualem"". We have to consider that this movie isn't about Saladin or the crusades. It is about Jerusalem and how it is the center of holy places for the 3 religions. At that time, Jerusalem was really a ""kingdom of heaven"".I am not a very knowledgeable person when it comes to history so I won't comment about the accuracy of historical facts. However, this movie added new things to my information. For example, I never knew that King Baldwin suffered from leprosy.Since I was a kid, Saladin has always been one of my favorite heroes and I was glad by the character that portrayed him in this movie.All the rest of the cast including Edward Norton and Orlando Bloom, did a good job in presenting their roles. The only criticism that i might have for this movie is ""sometimes"" the excessive use of violence, blood and epic warfare. Most of the times, it served its purpose but there were moments that they were disturbing.This movie should have been done a long time ago. So thank you again Ridley Scott 8/10",Kingdom of Heaven

Orlando's character, Balian, goes from a blacksmith serf to a nobleman with no signs of confusion or consternation. Orlando does well with the pain of a lost wife and child, but he can't seem to bring off the serf side. Too noble already. Little things, like knowing how to stand when being dressed in chain mail and armor, or riding a horse with no time spent learning at all... Either they cut too much out of the first half, when Balian learns to be a nobleman, or Orlando didn't try hard enough to be a serf. I enjoyed how this was filmed, but that was about it. It was very pretty. the I think the backstory of Balian was unnecessary to the film, and the whole politics was not set up well - i was confused on the roles of King of Jerusalem. Perhaps that's my ignorance of the details of the crusades, but I am no expert in Roman politics, but was able to figure out Gladiator.

461,yiannos_p,"Now, THIS, is how it's done!!",8,5 May 2005,"Scott made Gladiator, a film whose commercial and critical success started the historic epic trend. As a result of that we saw movies like Troy and Alexander which just came to prove that the genre is not important. What made Gladiator so good was not the milieu, but Scott's skillful direction.So now, 5 years after his last historic epic, Scott come back to the genre he resurrected to show everyone how it's done: Kingdon of Heaven has an excellent story which is told using beautiful cinematography and and, refreshingly, understated acting. Bloom is unrecognisable and Scott passes the theme of the film without tiring the audience, and with practically no cheesy lines!The story is balanced by some of the best battle scenes ever filmed which make excellent use of CG and appear always impressive and never fake. I am a great fan of the 'Lord of the Ring' films and loved the battles there. Kingdom of Heaven contains equally as impressive scenes, easily the best I've seen in a non fantasy film. Scott's film does not try to imitate Jackson. The most impressive scenes IMO are not in direct man to man combat but rather when some sort of weapon is used against the opponents army.So, if you ever likes an epic movie or a movie with great battle scenes and an appropriate theme, go watch Kingdom of Heaven, one the best of that sort.

We enter the cinema to be entertained. On epic scale. Damn the history! Deliver us a good story, just without the dumbness and obvious anachronisms.KoH does deliver such things...occasionally. It's very well made from technical point of view, though, i'm probably the only one who wasn't blown away by the visuals. Beautiful for sure, but nothing new. Lawrence of Arabia it isn't.Acting...Acting is OK, for the most part, except for the ""bad"" guys. Ouch!Bloom is OK. He's...adequate, and he doesn't overact, like Pitt or Farrell. That's already not a small virtue. He moves well and he's quite convincing fighting with the sword. OK, not particularly memorable performance, i admit. :) Also part of the problem lies in the script. Yeh, the same question that haunts many after seeing this movie is, how come the poor and illiterate blacksmith suddenly becomes the experienced warrior,tactician, estate manager and noble knight almost in one day? That's definitely not Orlando's fault.Eva Green - i really wish someone would explain me what she's doing in this movie? Liam Neeson is a great actor, but here he simply does what's required and that's not a big stretch for him. Still it's nice to see him once again on the big screen.And it was good to see Jeremy Irons even if it's quite hard to feel anything for someone who ""bravely"" leaves Jerusalem in the most difficult moment, before the siege, with his so much needed knights, because he suddenly has "" His Jerusalem"" dead with the late king. Huh?David Thewlis character jumps in and out of the movie so that ultimately you stop caring. Salladin also isn't given much time and lines, appears and disappears. Cudos to the actor playing him (sorry, forgot how to spell his name) for making the best of the little he's given to work with. Only the mutual efforts of him and Edward Norton save the confrontation scene before Keirak. You see, Salladin gathered his army before the fortress simply to meet king Baldwin personally, exchange 2 phrases and go away comforted by king's promise to punish the guilty Keirak owner. Duh?Which brings me finally to the 2 standouts for me in the movie - King Baldwin the 4th and the siege itself.I have no idea why Edward Norton performance goes almost uncredited. Maybe because he's only voicing the character and we see on the big screen a stand-in? Can someone, please, enlighten me on the subject? Because, if he does both - he deserves cudos for the best scene in the movie, imho. Though, at first, i couldn't fathom a normal explanation to why poor leper king looks like a damsel in distress in his clothes (ok, i can understand why he speaks like one, for sure) and wears a SILVER mask (isn't it a bit too hot and therefore simply uncomfortably painful for a leper?) and i wasn't quite moved by his tale of how he defeated Salladin at the age of 16, but then...When he enters Keirak and faces Raynold (sp?)...Movie suddenly comes to life. That's called a cinematic language, folks - show the character, don't TELL us about him. Now i believed in his victory at 16 and understood a whole lot more the deepness of his pain! And all this takes place for, like, less than 2 minutes? Unfortunately, the movie turns to sleep almost immediately after that until the siege comes. Ultimately, i have to admit, the poor king was the only one i felt sorry for. Maybe it's simply historically the most compelling figure of the movie, i don't know.Yeh, the siege...It's spectacular. Really. Worth the price of the ticket alone. You actually can see the tactics by which such things were won, though the tough question of how Bailian knows them only thickens without formidable answer, but who cares now? ;)So...what's the real problem of the movie? IMHO, it's the 21th century morality brought upon us in the 12th century. It's as ridiculous to hear the pacifistic ramblings from 12th century blacksmith or knight as to see the splendid flower arrangements on the 12th century dining table or reception room. What is it? Corporate meeting in Microsoft? Yes, there were reasonable people who made peace treaties with their enemies - simply because they knew they can't win or survive otherwise. And if you talked too much about ""why can't we just all live happily together"" you'd be dead long before this movie end. Those were the times. They were a bit different from ours and a bit like ours. But somewhere mr.Scott stepped into the wrong direction explaining this.The other problem, FOR ME PERSONALLY, is, simply put, the lack of heart, the emotional core, the"" why should we care about these characters at all"" reason. Some explain this by nearly an hour left on the cutting floor. Yes, that might explain some things. But if you need more than 3 hours to explain the hero's motivations and other movie ideas, sir, i'm afraid to report you - you're in big trouble. The episode in Keirak shows that you need less than 2 minutes to explain it and almost no dialog. And most important - you CAN do it. It's a pity that during more than 2 hours the director and screenwriter were too busy creating ""a serious"" Oscar-contender instead of cinematic magic.Overall - just an OK movie, imho. Way better than Troy or Alexander (but come on, i hated those!), but for me it's simply not enough. Again, just my humble opinion. :)",Kingdom of Heaven
463,alighthall2000,"Big scenes, big battles, wow another epic ...so what?",3,22 October 2005,"Visually stunning. Sound effects and score, great. Too bad that is not what makes a movie great. Story, plot, dialog and acting are what makes a film. This one did not have it. This one did not captivate. This one did not get me emotionally involved in characters. This one did not provide much story telling. Orlando Bloom? Please. Not a strong performance. Never once did I ever get a feel for his character. What about historical background? None. I am supposed to believe that a blacksmith goes from obscurity to a knight in a matter of weeks? And is in charge of the defenses of Jerusalem? That he is some kind of great heroic warrior for ""the people"" when his only battle is a skirmish with cavalry? That he is a leader of men? How? Show us his development into this mythical figure. What are his roots? Who was his father really? Ahh what can you expect? Ridley Scott wants to sell tickets at the best price and make a movie at the cheapest price period. That is the bottom line in Hollywood. And that is why this was created. To make money, not tell a story in the best possible way. No gem here. Just another big budget surefire money maker for an increasingly infantile audience.",Kingdom of Heaven
464,emspace,the idiots come out of the woodwork...,10,19 May 2005,"...just as I knew they would after this movie's release. I checked out the forum section and here we have it: American anti-Americans, American Muslim-haters, non-American anti-Americans, American religious nutjobs, all fiercely at war. Thank God they have their monitors to stare into, good thing they aren't actually facing each other like the Crusaders and Saracens did or there'd be blood on the floor for sure.Were any of these people actually AT the movie, or did they make up their minds long before it was released? I have my suspicions. Here's what I saw: Ridley Scott making a well-crafted (as always) movie that contains a subtle yet powerful statement. The statement in this movie is - are you ready? Because I'm not going to be subtle - HUMANITY IS SICK OF BEING TOLD WHAT THE WILL OF GOD IS BY KILLERS LOOKING TO RATIONALIZE THEIR KILLING! It is a plea to end terrorism, nothing less. Did you not hear over and over: protect the innocent, guard those unable to defend themselves? Did you not see Muslims behaving honorably, saying they do not put innocents to death? Did you not hear the priest on the pilgrim road chanting ""to kill an infidel is not murder, it is the path to heaven"", just as the Jihadists do now? It is not a movie about how bad ALL the Christians were, or how good ALL the Muslims were, it is a message to all of us, West and East, to wake up and reject religious fanaticism in any form and move forward - as a SPECIES - or be doomed to an eternity of hate and bloodshed.There were atheists chiming in on the forum too, but most of what I saw was the sort of sophomoric knee-jerk anti-authoritarianism you'd expect from people who've never actually thought about their so-called belief system. Just more contempt and hatred. There is nothing wrong with religion per se, but there is a LOT wrong with a LOT of people. And there is nothing wrong with Ridley Scott, who clearly identifies most closely with the character of Baldwin IV, the sort of leader the world could use many of, and as soon as possible.",Kingdom of Heaven
465,avatar007,"Forget Spielberg, RIDLEY is the new sh*t!!!!!",9,6 May 2005,"***(POSSIBLE) SPOILERS AHEAD ****It has been 5 years of almost gruelling waiting time for all Ridley fans in the anticipation of his next major (soon to be hit) KINGDOM OF HEAVEN.I went to see the movie here in Australia on opening night, hoping the follow-up to GLADIATOR (minus Ridley's 2003's ""MM""). Well, was I blown away by it all (I'm being sarcastic).Over the course of the movie I went on to ask myself a series of WTF (What the f---!!) questionsWhile the story and action is very good, there are severe loopholes in the plot. The first sequence of the movie, tells us of the return of GODFREY OF IBELIN. Even though K.O.H is a vastly different movie, it's hard not to draw comparisons to Ridley's eternal masterpiece, GLADIATOR.The movie starts of in a rugged area in France in the year of the lord - 1884 A.D. What looks to be a promising fight turns out to be nothing more than LORD GODFREY exchanging a few words with those that want to arrest BALIAN.Add to it, a guy with pigtails and the worst teutonic accent I have heard - for the purposes of this review I shall call him ""ULF"". All I could hear from this guy were the words 'UND', 'JA' & 'NEIN' (typical teutonic fare!!)As the movie progressed, I was more & more impressed with the battle scenes - none other director than the great man himself SIR RIDLEY can achieve the realism of war as seen through the eyes of the crusaders & Muslims alike.The powerful performances came from New Zealander Marton Csokas, who plays Guy De Lusignan, the successor to Baldwin, in one of his grittiest roles ever. So much for the actor who played low-life scum YORGI in xXx.The second most powerful performance came from the only American in the movie, a brilliant actor, the universally acclaimed Edward Norton. It was highly unjust of Ridley not to even show Edward's face in the movie. Edward pulls it off as leper king BALDWIN the 4th.Following the best performances of the lot, the 3rd place goes to the veteran of screen & stage (SIR) Jeremy Irons. He offers a lot of wise council to Baldwin, but ultimately his character has to decide whether to stay loyal to Balian, or jump ship. Instead Irons offers to jump ship, just as his character begins developing. 'No way to win an audience' I thought to myself.Liam Neeson, pulls off a very convincing GODFREY DE IBELIN, as well as Ghassan Massoud who plays the ever-scary SALADIN.The most accurate part of Ridley Scott's story-telling comes from his attention to the correct detail, even going as far as pronouncing the Muslim king's name as ""SALAAH-HUDIN"" instead of ""SALAAH DIN'Although, the funniest performance comes by the way of Brendan Gleeson as Reynald De Chatillon, leader of the Templar knights. Brendan is by far the biggest opportunist in Hollywood out of recent times, having starred in recent previous blockbusters such as GANGS OF NEW YORK & TROY.The best scene in K.O.H. is when Reynald starts kissing King Baldwin's hand like some desperate lover boy trying to win his ex back. The best bit of the movie was watching BALDWIN slay Reynald on the spot!! (That was mighty convincing for sure!!!)As the movie continued my questions grew immense. On my way home after watching KOH, I prepared the list of WTF questions:WTF happened to Guy De Lusignan? WTF happened to Hospitaller (David Thewlis) and how did he end up looking so deadly relaxed? (Pun intended!) WTF is up with Sybilla and that haircut? WTF is up with the surrender of Jerusalem? (This was tame pap!!! C'mon Orlando, you should have gone down with a fight at least....!! Wuss!)And last but not least, Orlando Bloom; while some may say the lad is too young to carry the weight of a big (soon-to-be) blockbuster-in-waiting. I, for one, did not think Orlando could pull it off successfully. Maybe it's his acting ability, and his age - he seems better off being a pirate or being in an immature movie.And Eva Green as Sybilla was he worst performer in the movie (Ridley what were you thinking when you cast this chick?!!!)For this review's sake I end by giving the movie a rating of 8 out of 10 (all cos of RIDLEY).KOH is sure to be nominated at next year's Oscars - If Ridley does not win it will be the crime of the millennium as its about time someone acknowledged the efforts of this gargantuan director.Well done RIDLEY (and everyone else!). A great effort. While it's very easy for us in the audience to be the judge and give a rating, one must appreciate the effort that Ridley takes while trying to near-perfect his craft of making (believable!) movies.See y'all at the Oscars '06.....but please, do not take the title of my review seriously for RIDLEY & SPIELBERG are equally great (although different!)Review Rating: 8/10",Kingdom of Heaven

Enough said. I purchased the Blu-Ray Directors Cut which is 50 minutes longer. Many of the questions you might have had are answered in the action of this 50 minutes. From the beginning until the ending the added parts make this a much better story. I will not tell you about the story as I guess you have seen the movie and will say the 194 minutes is a long time and in theaters would not make most people pleased, but at home it makes the movie a great watch.

467,rankfilm,"I was a worthy attempt that just fell short of the finish line, not the film that was expected.",8,14 May 2005,"The latest release from Ridley Scott centres around a young, recently bereaved, blacksmith named Balian, played by Orlando Bloom. Set in the Dark Ages at the time of the Crusades, the film begins with Balian mourning for his wife, who has just committed suicide. The full scale war that is raging in far off Jerusalem is of little concern to Balian and the pain he is experiencing, he has lost the love of his life and is beginning to lose his faith. His life seems to be over until he meets The Barron of Ibelin, legendary knight Godfrey. Godfrey, a veteran of the Crusades has returned home to France in search of his lost son and reveals himself as Balian's father. Desperate to rid himself and his wife of their sins, Balian embarks on a journey to the crusades with his new found father and mentor. During the journey Godfrey teaches Balian the true meaning of being a Knight. He makes Balian swear an oath to always protect his people. Balian embarks on a quest to the Holy Land where an unsteady peace prevails due to the efforts of the progressive Christian king, Baldwin IV, who dreams of a time when Muslims and Christians alike can live in peace in the sacred city. Unfortunately for him and the rest of Jerusalem, Baldwin is struggling against his own failing health and power greedy knights making war seem imminent. Balian with his new found purpose may have to face overwhelming odds for the good of his people and to keep to his father's wishes.Kingdom of Heaven was said to be the film to end the epic saga that has saturated the cinema in the past few years. Since the genres revival in 2000 with Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven is said to restore faith after the relevant flops of Alexander and Arthur. Inevitably this film is automatically compared to Scott's first epic release Gladiator. It is this comparison, how ever worthy, that drags the reputation of the film down. There are a number of noticeable similarities between the two that mean that it is automatically put in direct comparison but hopefully in time it will grow into a film which stands on its own numerous merits. Like Gladiator the story is that of an average person showing great courage and determination to carve out a reputation for himself. There is also the inclusion of the righteous leader being replaced by the tyrant, and the brave central character being the last hope to restore equilibrium. The concept of the 'one who has no desire to rule, must be the one to rule' is included in both films and the both central characters must confront grief and loss of faith, a faith which is eventually regained in the final scenes. There is also a striking resemblance of leading ladies in the two, which could be a reflection of Scott's ideal women, the unattainable dark princess. Although there is a number of noticeable similarities I stand by my theory of nothing is ever truly original and that Kingdom of Heaven will in time stand alone on its own merits. It has an incredible cast with such names as Jeremy Irons, Liam Neeson, Brendan Gleeson and Edward Norton, which are used to full effect. The basis of the story is that of honour and companionship, it is responsibility that inspires Balian, whereas Maximus seeks revenge. I feel that it is easier to relate to Gladiator, as I think that it reflects human nature more effectively. Balian is completely unselfish and stands up to the tyrant for the good of the people. Maximus is a selfish hero and stands up to the tyrant for revenge, I feel that this is a far more just motivation and would do the same had I been in his position. Kingdom of Heaven reflects the brotherhood of man, it shows that honour is on both sides and that in the end we are all the same biology regardless of religion. It is an emphasis that evil resides in the individual not in the nation, a fact that perhaps hits a bit close to home regarding the current war on terror. Kingdom of Heaven rivals its predecessor in every way but one, the lead. Orlando Bloom is in no way Russell Crowe, the role of Balian demands a manly yet sensitive lead which Bloom does not provide. Bloom is far too 'pretty' for the role and at times regress' back into Paris, his pathetic character in Troy. This is by no means the making of Bloom and perhaps the role would have been better suited to a more rugged actor such as Russell Crowe or Collin Farrell. I was a worthy attempt that just fell short of the finish line, not the film that was expected.3.5/5",Kingdom of Heaven

The dialogs are monologues, especially in the beginning where 'Smithy' Balian becomes the Baron of Idelin and is instructed by several insiders on how he will have to do his job. He just... listens. Those scenes were bluntly silly. Also completely ridiculous is the fact that when he arrives in Idelin for the first time and decides: let's dig up some water. He is being carried on the hands of hundreds of people for having this genius idea! Why nobody before him? Did nobody ever thought of trying to find water in the desert? So slap-me-silly stupid... .

OK, so it's not as good as ""Gladiator"", ""Blade Runner"" or ""Alien"", but it's not as bad as everybody says. Shure Orando Bloom feels a little too lost and silent for a role as big as this. But it's really all the roles put together that makes it worthwhile. Scotts moral vision of fanatics on both religions is fair. And he is balancing the scales as a fair man.

James Cameron said ""You will cut this film over my dead body."" With $130 million ""Kingdom of Heaven"", they should've killed the director and cut the film. Plainly put, it's long and boring, and it's extremely hard to follow the dialogue. There's no introductory explanation to the situation conveyed through dialogue. It's like watching a silent film with none of the frames where they put in dialogue. What made the battles ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"" so great was that they built up the suspense leading to the battle, showed the stakes and the opposing sides and then in a stroke of mastery pulled them off with the audience still grasping what is going on. When the big battle in Kingdom of Heaven comes around, it's as if Orlando Bloom's character (I never got his name) looks out he sees an army, it's as if he's saying, ""uh-oh, an army, this could be bad."" The battles are impossible to follow, everything moves too fast, and in the end, it's hard to understand what's going on. The script was terrible, the battles were boring, and the overall directing was clearly abysmal.

474,edward_ferguson,The CGI Effects Ruined It For Me,5,28 November 2005,"OK, obviously the CGI programmers on this film work out of warm Hollywood and have never even seen snow let alone have any idea how it moves! The snow moves sideways, flows upwards in some shots, and seems to have the properties of downy goose feathers, dusting up from the ground in light swirls at every movement. Up until that point, I had been having a great time, the costumes were fantastic. The director also went insane with CGI arrows during the last battle scene. There were about 2000 arrows constantly in the air for every archer on the ground. So many arrows that they were whizzing between the faces of actors as they talked casually, buzzing around their heads like mosquitos. I couldn't help it at one point and let a huge guffaw in the theatre. And to my surprise, other followed with laughter. All the people who say this is ""Visually Stunning!"", are right... but it's not realistic. Not even close. I doubt a true crusade battle would be a tenth as ""visually stunning"". If I want that, I'll watch ""the Matrix"", thanks. This movie would have been great, but they ruined it for me by cheesing out and trying to do the whole Hollywood overblown effects thing.

Some attempt (for a typical Hollywood Product) at period authenticity. In the end, if you understand, the message of the film is correct.The Bad: Makes the Crusades into a soap opera. They were much more complex than that. Most of the Crusaders who were nobles were in it for riches and lands to conquer. They were far tougher and better warriors than is shown in the film. The poor were in it for salvation. The whole area had changed hands every 500 years previously, so anyone claiming to be the 'rightful owner' was in jeopardy. The Muslims were just the latest tide that had come in. Now the Crusaders wanted some of the action. Kingdom of Heaven is an action movie at the beginning and the end, with the large middle section a lot of talking in dark rooms.

First, since we're now in the 21st Century, let's present both sides of an issue and let people decide. This movie fails. The Crusades are presented as solely due to a desire for 'fame, fortune, and power' on the part of the Crusaders.

Knighthood wasn't an overnight process- it was taught from childhood. Swordsmanship, wearing of armor, horsemanship and other areas took years to learn.OK, let me understand this. The ship sinks and Balian somehow, while unconscious, manages to hold onto a sword.Even more unlikely, the ship sinks and there just happens to be a section large enough to hold a horse, which somehow manages to reach land upright.The Muslim forces somehow manage to build multiple ballistas in what appears to be the space of HOURS?! - While the Knights Templar certainly DID exist, they weren't near the force (in terms of numbers) portrayed in the movie.When Balian returned to France, why wasn't he arrested for the MURDER of the priest?

480,rileymullins,Kingdom of Heaven is a Ridley Scott Masterpiece,10,31 August 2006,"Kingdom of Heaven (KOH) is an amazing film. I saw it in the theater but the reason it's so great is because of the 4-Disc Director's Cut, which is a must own for any KOH fan.Story: A well written script, KOH is about a blacksmith whose wife has committed suicide and he seeks out to redeem her in the city of Jerusalem, but ends up defending the people in the great battle against the Muslims.Cast: The cast for this film was outstanding. One would at first question Orlando Bloom as the leading role of Balian (let's face it, he's no Russell Crowe), but this is by far his best main character performance. Liam Neeson is great as usual, as Balian's long lost father. Jeremy Irons is a great pick because he looks like he's from the crusades and his voice is undeniable. Obviously he's a great actor as well. Eva Green does very well for basically being the only woman in the film and she also fits the the time period well. Martin Csoskas give a great show as the bloodthirsty wanna-be king. Brendan Gleeson.. Do I even need to say anything? The man is incredible. He's so great at being the jerk. Ghassan Massoud and Alexander Siddig do great as playing Muslims in the film. Edward Norton is completely astounding in his uncredited performance as the leper King Baldwin. He is one of my favorite characters in the film.Music: The music score for this movie is definitely in the top 10. Harry Gregson-Williams delivers a powerful score in this one. Gregson-Williams was a great pick though straying from Ridley Scott's usual Hans Zimmer.Other: The sets, the costumes, the editing, the cinematography are all superior. They are all very authentic and beautiful and add to the films realness.Ridley Scott is brilliant. You can definitely see a resemblance of Gladiator in KOH, which is a great thing because who doesn't like Gladiator. His ability to create worlds is unlike any other director in history. The 4-Disc Director's Cut allows you to see more of what Ridley Scott's methods are like.4-Disc Director's Cut: It has everything you want to see. It puts approximately 45 minutes back into the film and what a great 45 minutes it is. It goes much more in depth especially with Eva Green's Character Sibylla. It includes all the essentials that you would want in a 4-Disc set.Overall this is a great film and has become one of my very favorites since the past year or so.

It had many flaws here and there and the biggest of them all was placing Orlando Bloom in the lead. Don't get me wrong, I think he did an excellent job in LOTR, but he just does not have enough charisma and/or acting skills to pull this one off.

He does have some problems, but give the bloke a chance, it is his first big lead role. I think he just needs to learn to let some of his own character and confidence to come through. If he does that he'll become a very good actor.The rest of the cast is a star studded array of talent, that all bring their own flair to their roles.I would recommend this film, but if you're not going to see it without the tinted glasses, I wouldn't bother.",Kingdom of Heaven

I see many of the characteristics in this character, in Orlando. To me he seems to be someone that is loyal, a true friend, and would not turn his back on a friend or a stranger if that person needed help.The visual effects are spectacular. The sites that were chosen, were perfect for the background scenes. I can't even imagine how hard it would be to film in the desert. Ridley Scott is known for his fight scenes, and he does not disappoint. I sat in the center of the theater and found myself ""ducking"" and ""dodging"" arrows and fireballs. And the one thing that was even better than the visual settings, were the costumes. The gowns were beautiful and lords were handsome. I feel that when the costumes are just right, then the movie will work.This film was well worth the wait. The storyline carries such truth about what's happening in today's world.

But I really loved this movie. The cinematography was awesome, the atmosphere - simply amazing. I have read quite a bit about the crusades and can appreciate the fact - that for some - its just a bit too complicated and one cannot quite fathom why the passion and emotions play out as they are.

Kingdom of Heaven tells stories about Europeans' crusades and how Christianity was spread with sword. These stories have been told already in so many movies. But Kingdom of Heaven tells this a bit from a different view. It's not like Europeans total evil, people of the Holy Land victims or Muslims butchered Europeans... In the end the battle was not between religions. It was for the people. Fresh and good idea from an American film although it sounds hypocrite. These history spectacles are based on a few true historical event and happenings but of course they are twisted to fit in the story. The fact that Bloom's character was not really a blacksmith is not the problem. It just that a blacksmith rising to leader of a defense battle of Jerusalem and a true knight master doesn't feel credible. There are also specified 'the goods' and 'the bads' in this. Bads are too evil and goods too noble. Kingdom of Heaven is a good and most importantly entertaining spectacle film. Best of the three ones released recently.",Kingdom of Heaven

Well lets keep that for the end.There is no denying that 'Kingdom of Heaven' failed in theaters. But why did it fail? Why are so many critics negative?Lets start with the cast. The cast is great. Even Orlando Bloom. But most people think different about his acting. Why? 1. Bloom is being overrated at everything. Some people will dislike him for that. And even start to hate him, so they want to bring him down. Even if this is his best performance till now. 2. Maybe some people are jealous at success. Or the feeling that their girlfriend thinks Orlando is the ""Better man"" in bed than their partner. 3. I can keep going on like this about Orlando, but I know most still dislike him. My own opinion about him in Kingdom of Heaven: Good enough to lead...Another problem are the holes in the plot. Why are they there? Simple, this is not the movie with all scenes that were filmed. The extended KoH 4disc DVD edition will be 220 minutes long. So if you hated the gaps. Wait for this edition to come. Thats all I can say about that.History, is the subject I love! I read about it all the time. I don't have to tell that KoH is inaccurate to history. And many people still hate history when it is altered in an easy story to understand. And still they say: How boring! All they talk about is God an Alah. Well sorry guys but our history is mainly shaped by belief and religion.The music score, is just great! Worth an Oscar if you ask me. I think 60% likes the music and 40% dislikes hit. This also gives a point why people dislike KoH.The effects. Also worth an Oscar. The action is great. I don't have anything to ad to this.Well I could keep going on and waste my time to convince certain people to think different about this movie. But what is the point? After all you said it yourself already the movie sucked right? I just told you why you think it sucks.In the end KoH contains an important lesson and comes out as an movie with a better story than Gladiator. Just wait for the 4 disc DVD edition.

493,abeal49,somebody has a political agenda,5,9 May 2005,"Curious film; everybody in it actually existed, except Godfrey of Ibelin (but maybe he was supposed to be Godfrey of Bouillon, who was a real person). Historically, Balian ""the Younger"" of Ibelin married Maria, widow of Almaric I, this would make him stepfather to Baldwin IV The Leper and Sybilla of Jerusalem. History says Sybilla, wife of Guy of Lusignan, died during the siege of Acre in 1190, but the movie says she rode off into the sunset with Balian (In the movie, he's her lover, not her stepfather, remember? Not that those two relationships are mutually exclusive, Woody Allen did it) after he tells Richard I of England, whose character is a composite of Tony Blair and George Bush, that no thanks, he's not going on another Crusade, he's going to live as a hippie in France. Historically, he escaped to Tripoli with his family after Hattin, and in 1192 helped negotiate the peace treaty between Richard I and Saladin.What I don't understand is, if the historically accurate version of the story was that interesting, why did the writers mess it up? They thought they couldn't sell a story with a hero who negotiates peace treaties between Christians and Muslims?a post script: I read the comment from Dick Steele, about the audience laughing when Richard I shows up.

495,raoulfenderson,"Sprawling, Confusing, Politically Correct Eye Candy",4,10 October 2005,"I suppose in a pop-historical romantic epic such as this one, it's too much to expect depth in your characters -- they mostly have to be ""writ large"" -- but it just won't do to explain this savage religious warfare as essentially caused solely by the whims and stupidity of a few evil leaders. But in a romantic epic you have to have the really bad guys to go with the good guy.And here's our good guy, Orlando Bloom, who, from his humble beginnings as a village blacksmith, fortuitously acquires the mantle of nobility PLUS incredible fighting prowess PLUS a brilliant command of military tactics, and STILL can't seem to get through a scene fully awake. He's an idealistic young man in a world of cynical land-grabbing hypocrites, with a vision of a ""kingdom of conscience"" that prohibits him from ordering the death of a rival but not, after all, from sleeping with the rival's wife.Most of this film lulled me into a state of bemused semi-wakefulness -- I didn't understand most of the dialog, couldn't really figure out who was fighting who or why, but there were nice pastoral landscape scenes, manly knights, and a beautiful damsel -- only to blast me out of my lethargy with the loud, over-cooked, over-extended battle scenes. I wondered about the physics of the medieval siege as I witnessed flaming boulders hurled at the velocity of cruise missiles into the walled city by the Saracen's catapults. Damn, dog, why bother inventing gunpowder, when you've got this stuff? And you know, the Muslims, in addition to the best weaponry, had all the best doctors and philosophers, AND the best all-around guy ever in Saladin, who gave the barbaric Christians a lesson in Christian forgiveness by not slaughtering them all at the end, even though the Christians had slaughtered all the Muslim inhabitants of Jersalem when they had taken over the city. Hmmm, didn't Saladin have factions within HIS army yapping for blood? Of course he did, but maybe it's not the right time in OUR history to let plot get in the way of the story.",Kingdom of Heaven

(mild Spoilers),5,10 May 2005,"KINGDOM OF HEAVEN (spoilers) is no Gladiator by far, Orlando Bloom could barely cast a shadow on Russell Crowe, but he does a fine job none the less. His enemies under the same flag or apposed to it are less daunting than most and we feel its only a matter of time before he will prevail. I'm starting to get sick of these over the top battle scenes that my mind can barely register all the action per frame (too much information thank-you). Lots of improbabilities here also, I cant believe after such a effective catapult bombardment, that Bloom could even muster a decent defense with his own catapults. He carefully ranged his weapons to hit the enemy when they reached the marker, that would work too, if he had WWII artillery! Seems these guys can load and fire a catapult in 5 seconds, in real life the only way the markers could of been effective, is if the enemy camped there! I hoped the Arabs had captured these catapults and siege towers, cause where in bloody desert are they gonna find the timber to build them? In reality the Arabs really starved out the Christians to give up the holy land, (and shed far less blood than depicted), but that wouldn't be fun now would it Ridley? The domino effect of siege towers was equally breathtaking as it was hilarious, and had a probability factor of one and 10 million! I still cant figure out how the Arabs were fought to a standstill. Orlando takes the moral high road at every corner, till I cant believe after all that blood had been shed, he couldn't have gotten the same terms if he would of asked the Arabs before the battle (too much of a spoiler to tell)! So too many died in vain (like most wars), so he doesn't stand out as any great resourceful like soldier in my book.

Fight scenes were awesome bit of blood here and the odd beheading. But end result was good acting from all parts even Orlando did well. C.G.I was fantastic especially in the final fight scene. The end result was it left you thinking about the film you learn a bit of English history and how messed up we were back then.

For example it completely fails to explain why Balian's brother hates him so much? Balian's wife's death and what seems to be a very hostile and long ongoing conflict with his brother could be enough content for an entire movie if done right, and here it serves merely as a very dramatic but ultimately fairly irrelevant introduction into a completely different kind of story where Balian's redemption arc from killing his own brother, turns into a vague and unfocused reflection on atheism, the ""true and pure"" values of knighthood, honour and loyalty to an ideological high ground that doesnt exist as the movie complacently concludes with ""No one has claim.......everyone has claim""Overall still the better version of a very flawed movie with great potential.",Kingdom of Heaven

500,Lotharios,Gladiator 2: Electric Bugaloo,6,7 April 2005,"I saw this at a screening last night and found it to be a mediocre rehash of Gladiator. In fact there is even a scene in which the hero (Orlando Bloom) is brought before the King and is asked to command the armies when he's dead. Bloom refuses, and the corrupt Kight becomes king instead. Sound familiar? There are several good battle scenes, but half of them are in slow motion with the heavy operatic music, then speed up to look choppy. Wait, all of them are like that, just like Gladiator. There are too many Braveheart speeches and there is a major problem with the story. There is a supposedly major conflict set up between Bloom and the Commodus character, but it is never resolved. The Queen, the main love interest, blames herself for the war, and trails off into madness, wasting our time. There are some good things, such as the king and all of the character actors. They should have found an actor with more presence than Bloom, because when Liam Neeson, David Thewlis, Jeremy Irons, Brendan Gleeson, even Joko Ahola are on screen, unless your a female, your eyes are on them. The King, with his cool silver mask and Brando voice, was a great idea. Too bad It also reminds me of Gladiator. It's two hours and twenty minutes long, but it felt like almost three.

I do not know if the problem is that it should be another actor who played Balian de Ibelín and Sibila, or is that simply these two characters should not be in this movie.

503,csteiner-1,"Hollywood epic, but not a true epic.",5,9 May 2005,"First of all, I give it a five only for battle scenes at the end. The rest of the movie was slow, riddled with holes and was historically inaccurate. Here are some of the things that bugged me most about this movie.1. Main character - Balian (Bloom's character) starts out as a humble blacksmith (hmm.. where have I seen this before?), then he becomes the illegitimate son of a nobleman called Godfrey, who dies within the first 20 minutes of the movie from gangrene or something. He spends about 4 seconds trying to teach Balian how to use his sword better, then there is a battle where he gets hit by an arrow. A short while later he passes the sword over to his son (he knights him just before dying). Throughout the movie Balian's character has one fight with an individual Arab swordsman that wants to take his horse, where he easily wins. He lets a second guy go with the horse. This guy says, you will be honored or something in the eyes of your enemy, when you meet him in battle. Later there is a battle where he and his knights try to fight against a great number of Muslims. Guess what, just when Balian is about to be killed by the Muslims, the same guy that he let go steps up and repeats his quote from earlier (he is actually a leader of some sort). Like we didn't see that coming. He let's Balian go. Then, there is a part where Balian get's attacked by three templar knights which he easily dispatches. Boy, I want to know where this instant sword wielding class is at so that I can go. Suddenly, towards the end of the film we see him in the final battle as completely leaving his humble upbringings as a blacksmith to become a superior war tactician, not to mention a master swordsman (oh yeah, I forgot that 12th century blacksmiths are highly trained swordsman with war tactic skills.) Then, It was almost like they had to justify the stupidity by throwing in a question from the bishop, where he says, ""just because you call someone a knight doesn't mean they are a better fighter"". Then I think someone says that it does, but I can't quite remember. See history below. The end was just stupid, the way that King Richard I rides up asking for Balian in his old village, like as if he would know.2. Princess/queen Sybella- The romance between her and Balian was unnecessary Hollywood crap at it's finest, right down to the end of the movie. Why on the planet Earth did she need to cut her hair? I could guess that it was out of fear. She wanted the Muslims to believe she was a man/boy, so that she would not be raped. See history below.3. Did not see the purpose for Jeremy Iron's character in the movie. He spouts off a few lines and then leaves.4. Question - did they pull some of the props from Return of King, or what?5. Movie seemed too rushed together during key sequences, but at the same time seemed too long.6. History was amiss. Based on what I have read from several sources, there are many historical discrepancies. Here are some, - Balian was not actually an illegitimate son, and his father's namewas not Godfrey. - Balian was married to someone else during his timein Jeruselum, and did not have an affair with the princess. - The princess remained married to Guy (later released from the Muslims). She died from an epidemic a few years later, as did her children, while with Guy. - There was an 8 year old that succeeded Baldwin IV (masked dude) and he was poisoned a year later, at which time Guy and Sybella took over. There are a ton of discrepancies, but this is a few. I know that most were done for movie story, but why use historical characters if you are going to change their history completely?C.",Kingdom of Heaven

Moslem prays towards Qiblat where the Kaabah in Mecca is, so they pray in 'Jamaah' or together eg. a marching band, straight lines no leaving any space, in your movie, there are many scenes where Moslems pray but not in Jemaah but individual and while the bilal is calling the Moslems for prayer, there should not be any Moslems praying except for 'sunnat prayers' meaning individual prayers before the main prayer time, so there should not be a 'Jemaah'.

As far as I can tell, except for Liam Neeson and Ghassan Massoud, it's a bunch of stiffs and slow-mo gore.Not only is it entirely historically INaccurate, it is equally culturally so: no Middle Eastern princess I know of rode around in sexy gold jewelry talking to strangers and revealing her face. And excuse me: how is it that people who have lived in the desert successfully for centuries need a dirty European blacksmith to teach them how to build a well and irrigate their land? That was a concoction to make a hero out of Bloom's otherwise wooden character.In terms of even a nod to accuracy: Most of the Muslims' horses weren't Arabians or Barbs, the type they would have had in those eras. (Arabian bloodlines are documented to 3,000 years ago, folks.) Ridley should have reviewed ""Lawrence of Arabia"" before he made this movie, which had Real Bedouins and Their Arabs! Plus Ridley committed my worst movie sin: Fake Horsey Noises. Sorry, folks, horses only nicker, scream, or neigh under these circumstances: when they're hungry or lonely, when they're dying in great pain, or when they are having sex. It just doesn't happen when they turn left fast because the actor/stuntman doesn't know how to handle the reins.The final blow: here's Bloom running through the movie being true to knighthood (honor, protect the weak, etc.) telling a PRINCESS to just ""stop being a princess."" Royalty in the Middle Ages had responsibilities, too, you know: it was the royals' castles that provided protection from attack for the locals. ""Just stop"" and you leave them to the next warlord's mercy. Or could that be just another sexist view that the woman's ""place"" is with her man -- not with the power? Naw.

There is also little background of the Muslim/Christian conflict which makes the end a little confusing, I know it isn't supposed to be a history lesson but come on, starting with the audience reading what is happening to the main character is just lazy film making and is what starts the lack of character and story development.

515,markline-2,Intellectual Historical Fiction 10/10 for Directors cut 8/10 original,10,7 May 2005,"I saw this film, and the last thing i say it is is exciting....but i am not sure it is supposed to be.... The point, to me , of this film is to show you the utter chaotic nature of the time, and the pointlessness of war on such terms, and only shows fighting as being just when it is meant to protect the helpless, defend your lands and homes, etc. etc.I really liked all the subtext of the film, talking about how religion if not faith and not god, and ignorance towards the beliefs of other races leads to the conflicts and not to understanding and peace.As for the movie itself, i think that a three hour version will be great, because the movie itself has a lot that is missing and cut out...SPOILERS 1. Liam Neeson's character is not in it long enough 2. So many things feel rushed over (the ship wreck at sea?whaaa??) (the love? scene?) (the development of so many characters) 3.The beginning of the movie, when most of Goddfrey's group, a very dynamic one, is killed, reminded me of the same frustration i had watching COld MOuntain, when his friends are all killed off at the beginning , you think, wow, those characters looked interesting and dynamic, i wonder what they are-----oh, too late their dead. 4.people pop in and out of places and you have no idea how they got thereI think Ridley's major flaw is that he rushes things to much, and forgets that the characters motivations might get left behind and so is the drama, (like Gladiator, when he goes from his house after finding his family dead to a gladiator fighting in a ring a 1000 miles away in about five minutes.Same thing here, the relationships of characters are not brought to fruition by him and the script, with myself wanting to see so much more of the liam neeson dynamic...Despite these criticisms, I liked the movie because of the ... 1.epic scope. 2.cinematography 3.performances from the whole cast, minus eva green and a pass for ORlando...I Thought he was great in the beginning and then was hit or miss on some important lines at the end of the film....HE WAS very good as the character he was in this film, BUT, some lines are FILM LINES, and need to be said in a way to carry a film, like when the priest asks him if just by making a man a knight makes him a better fighter,,,, the music builds up, he turns around, and undramatically says a tired ""yes"", .......coulda been better, but then his confrontation with saladin was great,,,,,,so he just needs to realize the importance of all lines....So overall, 8 out of 10.....i think when ridley releases his longer version, with slower scenes and not such hacked editing, and when people calm down and realize this is a piece of historical fiction, and that it shows the stupidity of crusades as some kind of noble endeavor, regardless of historical tweaks, they will realize he made a good film about tolerance and understanding, and that people have to tell the difference between the church/religion, and true faith and righteousness......added on directors cut review... read my posts ...all sins forgiven...this directors cut of this film which looking back on my own review it is eerie that i knew it HAD to exist and was needed...DIRECTORS CUT NOW IS one of my favorite films of all time and now i understand it wasn't ridley's fault...studios suck....great expanded death and completely epic now, not so much only about action.... A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FILM...thewlis and neeson shine, sheen is devious, characters and meaning put back in...awesome.....A+......",Kingdom of Heaven
516,wiggipop,"great movie, thanks to excellent cast",7,7 May 2005,"I came into this film very cautiously, having seen Troy and feared for an exact repeat of that film. And the fact that this had Orlando Bloom in it who was also in Troy, and might I add, was extremely annoying and frustrating in Troy, he lowered the rating of Troy down to 2 stars. But in fact i enjoyed this film immensely. I thought Orlando Bloom carried the film excellently, with great support from Liam Neeson and Jeremy Irons. Eva Green rounded off the main cast quite well, giving quite a real performance as the 'love interest'. One thing that annoyed me however was the amazing similarities in the battle sequences to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, although I'm sure there is a perfectly good reason for that. After all, LOTR was fictional. Great film overall, much thanks to Orlando Bloom, and his character.",Kingdom of Heaven
517,future_citizen,Overrated,3,1 April 2013,"Poorly scripted. Over dramatic. I find myself dissecting it's flaws throughout the whole film. The more flaws which build up, the more I find myself critiquing the film as a ""terrible movie"" in my head. The acting isn't particularly good. I never felt engaged in the essence of it all. Some of the props looked cheap and unbelievable such as one briefly shown shield I saw which looked like it was carved out of foam and painted. The characters dialogue feel scripted and unnatural. The ""good"" characters are always conveyed as flawless and impeccably witty. The ""bad"" characters are always overly cold and heartless. This movie felt cheap. Far from being ""epic"" as many other IMDb reviewers have claimed. It's an insult to call this film ""epic"" in comparison to true epic medieval films like the LOTR trilogy. This film is a C grade disappointment.",Kingdom of Heaven

I loved how the movie equally portrayed the Islamic and Christian religions respectfully and I love the point in the movie that god is in your heart and your head and not some fanatical illusion a bunch of wack jobs use in order to gain money and power.The movie was okay, with Lord of the Rings and braveheart battle like scenes combined. The casting was great how the director had real life arab actors not just white actors pretending to be arabs. Also Orlando Bloom does a decent job acting and his supporting cast of eva green and the rest of the actors do a pretty good job.This movie is not nearly as powerful as gladiator or braveheart.

519,sappersil,"Overall, very good movie. Great epic.",9,8 April 2005,"Hubby and I just got back from a screening in LA tonight. We both liked the movie quite a bit. The audience was spellbound during the movie - not a sound, very little movement, and, what do you know, no coughing. I think a couple cell phones did go off. Hrmph. Everyone applauded at the end, so I am guessing most people liked the movie.Hubby is a history buff. He thought Kingdom was better than Gladiator, especially as an epic. It is conducted on a much grander scale than Gladiator, which was more about 2 men and a woman. Kingdom is about a nation, a time, lots of people. He did not think it was too long and definitely wants to see it again. (We both thought of Gladiator because that's what all the ads say - from the Director of Gladiator.)I also liked this movie a lot. So we will likely see it again when it is released. There is a lot going on in this movie.**** SPOILERS FOLLOW **** SO STOP HERE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW ****Highlights for me included Balian and his father's scenes (which, for me, really showed Liam Neeson off well, especially his death scene), the scene when Balian awakens on the beach and fights his first Seracin (sp?), his time spent by himself in Jerusalem, his 1st meeting and battle with Saladin, his refusal to do a small evil for great good and that whole series of scenes, the final, amazing battle sequence, and the ending (though that was a bit dreamy - I mean what are they gonna do now without a kingdom?) I liked both the movie ending and the ending of the battle. I even like when Balian meets King Richard: ""I am a blacksmith"" And I am the King of England."" ""I am a blacksmith.""Other favorite lines ""This is not a good horse."" (Not sure if I am remembering this correctly), ""Perhaps if I'd had a different teacher"" between Saladin and his buddy about how the battle is going. Lots of cool, cheesy, must-see-again stuff like that.Needless to say, I thought the movie showed off Bloom and Neeson very well, though Neeson's role was fairly short. I think Jeremy Irons was underutilized, though that was consistent with his character I think. Loved David Thewlis also. Hubby did think that Russell Crowe is a more intense commander than Bloom. I thought Bloom created a character more in tune with his own personality (less yelling and screaming) and who had a commanding presence of his own.To me Gladiator might be a bit better than Kingdom but also different. Kingdom is definitely on a much grander scale, with huge battle scenes, which I loved. I especially love that Bloom's character Balian fights without mercy and that there are things like cutting where the horses' legs would be, using various items to injure/put down the enemy and just plain doing whatever it takes to get the enemy down. This is definitely a 'dirtier"" bloodier movie than Gladiator, which was much more symbolic violence than ""let's see the man's head hacked off"". So for battle sequences, Kingdom wins hands down. However, Lucilla and Maximus were a better developed pair than Balian and Sybilla, so that part, for me, made Gladiator edge out Kingdom. Sybilla is more moody than a real person until the end and my impression was there was too much to do for Balian to have time for love.There is some stylization here - such as the blood splatters and some battle movements - but overall very well used.Unlike hubby, I did think the movie was a bit long but then I have trouble sitting longer than about an hour and a half, so I was fidgeting a bit, which caused me to notice that no one else was fidgeting. I also fidgeted at the Lord of the Rings, etc. Basically anything long :-) This was an all adult crowd, so who knows what kiddies would have thought. Anyways, a very enjoyable evening. Very glad we went.",Kingdom of Heaven
520,leilamehti,Highly Recommended as Educational,8,27 May 2005,"This film should dissuade the American audience of a myth of French ""pacifism."" The French knights (google Knights Templar), historic initiators of Crusades on the Holy Land, were anything but ""pacifist."" Not only were the French bloody with Arabs but also with each other. French and the Arabs have a very violent history continuing into 20th century, when the French colonists killed over 1 million Algerian Arabs. But France finally came to give up their costly fight because of what else????? - ARAB INSURGENY! Those who ignore history are condemned to repeat it. But maybe by 21st century - the French have finally learned their history lesson and tried to advise the Land of the Freedom Toasts - but the Toasts didn't' get it.

521,sicboi81,Impressive Battles...and Isn't That Why We're Watching?,8,13 May 2005,"""Kingdom of Heaven"" is an overall strong film with a rather weak philosophical premise. By this, I mean that the battle scenes are well shot and there is no overly cooked love story. Ridley Scott doesn't waste our time depicting unnecessary travel time or emoting, which I appreciated immensely. However, other than that, the rest of the movie is devoted to illustrating the illogic of religion. The evil Crusaders say ""God wills it"" before they slaughter an Arabic caravan and one accuses Balian(Orlando Bloom)of blasphemy when he (Balian) advises Guy that it would be folly to face Salahudin's forces in the desert. This kind of thing unneccesarily pervades the entire movie when I think that even the least astute viewer will have gotten the point after the first time something like this occurs. Jeremy Irons shines through as Tiberius, best described as a humanist, who advises Balian of the dangers of being taken in by dogma. However, one doesn't need an entire film to convince most people that religion is illogical and has been employed by evil men to achieve evil ends throughout the course of history. What was appreciated was the evenhanded way in which Christians and Arabs were counterpoised. The narrative didn't take sides, although the Christians were shown to exploit ""God's will"" more than the Arabs seemed to. Otherwise, Balian has very little character development throughout the film. He behaves as he does (ie bravely and unselfishly) after a brief meeting with his estranged father, Godfrey (Liam Neeson) who knights him before he passes away. Apparently the conviction Balian is able to cull from this event sustains him throughout the film although the transformation from brooding blacksmith to noble knight and defender of Jerusalem seems immediate and takes no thought or internal struggle on the part of Balian. We are also never shown how Balian learned military tactics and how to lead soldiers since, before this, he was just a blacksmith in a small French town. The soundtrack, much like the soundtracks to all of the period war dramas I've seen lately, isn't great. All of these soundtracks, whether the movie is set in Rome, Jerusalem, Greece, Great Britain, etc. feature a woman singing in what sounds like Arabic creating a hollow simulacra of the time and place the movie is meant to represent. Otherwise, the battle scenes were impressive and the film is not bogged down by florid sentiments which makes it quite enjoyable despite some initial flaws.",Kingdom of Heaven
522,andromeda007,Kingdom of confusion,6,9 May 2005,"Looking at this movie objectively, it has most of the things needed to make a great epic. Fair amount of historical accuracy, great male leads, beautiful scenery, multitude of military and historical consultants that do know their job. So why does the movie leave you feeling bored and sleepy throughout most of it's showing picking up towards the end where we enjoy a nice, lovely bloodbath? The convoluted and complicated dialog that is given in small chunks left me wondering when will the battle scenes will begin to break the monotony.The priesthood of the time is shown to be completely corrupt and immoral whilst the Saracens are lambs for the slaughter by big bad Templars. Among other inconsistencies is the changes in Orlando Bloom's character without any explanations but things we are later told happened over time. How much time passes is actually unknown and we are left to guess the rest of the pieces to the obscure puzzle that is presented in the story as the narrative. The female lead is simply awful, the actress tried to play Cleopatra of the Middle Ages instead of the truly tragic victim of circumstance she was supposed to be.Although the battles and the massive siege at the end are top notch the end of the movie is a welcome relief to a long confused story that despite the wonderful efforts of Orlando Bloom,Liam Neeson and Jeremy Irons left me and my friends with a sense of being taken for a ride, duped by the big names of the movie stars and the director.

523,ladyzag2,Gorgeous movie--and I'm not just talking about Oralndo Bloom,8,10 May 2005,"Some professional critic noted that Ridley Scott should be considered the master of the historical epic, what with his outstanding work in 'Gladiatior'followed by 'Kingdom of Heaven.' Having seen 'Kingdom of Heaven' I would have to agree. It is a beautifully shot movie with a richness of realistic color and detail that is unmatched. The battles are battles and the gore level is to be expected.The same critic, however, discredited Orlando Bloom's performance as too boyish. I disagree. Unlike 'Troy' where he came across as a boy playing at being an adult, presumably on purpose, here he shows depth/range and is utterly convincing. He may have doomed himself to only star in historical epics for the rest of his career but so be it.P.S. Since submitting my review, I've gone through some of the others. There are quite a few that nit-pick on the historical facts. Look, it's a movie, not a doctoral thesis on the Second Crusade. If you are the type of person who can't stand it when movies based on history (which is written by the winners anyway so it is in and of itself biased/slanted) get certain facts wrong, then don't go see this movie. If, however, you can just appreciate a well-thought out and balanced script in a film that has memorable performances, is beautifully shot by a director who knows a thing or two about shooting battle scenes then this movie should top your list of ones to see.",Kingdom of Heaven

I have seen the movie Gladiator and I loved it, just throwing it out there. People have said that they think this IS BETTER THAN GLADIATOR. This I had to see. So I pop in the movie thinking how good its going to be and i just kept waiting for it to jump into action. Waiting. Waiting. and waiting. There was maybe a 5 minute action scene and then another an hour later. This had to be the slowest movie I've ever seen, when there was an action scene it lasted maybe about a minute. I was watching the directors cut so it ran about another 45 minutes longer, but still it was awful. I won't spoil the movie for you but please, anyone who hasn't watched this movie before, or if you're thinking about watching it thinking its going to be as good as gladiator, or EVEN BETTER, do not, I REPEAT DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE, unless you like movies that will make you fall asleep.",Kingdom of Heaven

Was looking forward to see Liam Neeson as Baleans father and he didn't fail me (except that he dies after 30 mins). I have never been impressed with Blooms acting, hes just an average actor. Casting him as the lead, was not the best choice. He looks too boyish and vague. Certainly not looking and acting like the kind of man who would lead the defence of Jerusalem. More emphasis should have been made on his journey to Jerusalem and less on the intrigues etc. when he is there.

There are some clear facts like 1) Any viewer of this movie should have some knowledge about crusaders. Not that the movie is wrong but you need to know to understand the movie more. 2) From the same reason (see 1), I expect the director to add some comments on why is this city was important. And who owned it in the time period, till that war we seen in the movie happened. I believe that should clear people's minds. The movie is based on ""fighting for Christianity"" theme. Besides this I do not believe the all crusaders and the crusades were based on this. That is known fact that the other part of the world was more civilized where the crusaders were attacking. What I mean about civilized was ""science"", ""economy"" and etc. Most of the crusaders after the 1st and the 2nd one were more interested in ""goods"" that they can bring back than holly war. Of course movie is not about that people, but after all that was a fact in that period. In over all, movie is quite nice and exciting to watch. If the costumes are realistic, it is amazing how a war can change people. If they were that similar that period, so NOT COMMUNICATING might have been changed everything.

I did not see the original theatrical so I was so disappointed after going through 3 hours of film. This film has nothing on Gladiator. Orlando Blooms performance was watchable and he wisely chose to remove any personality of himself from the character. I enjoyed him in POTC but here he is a puppet under Ridley's control. In fact, I would go onto say that I was sublimally thinking of Ridley as Balian while I was watching. It might have something to do with the following:*After watching the introduction by Ridley Scott I noticed his beard trimmings almost matched that exactly of Orlando's in the film (or goatee if you prefer) *Orlando being under Ridley's total control had lost his soul and was replaced by Ridley's essence while filming. *Orlando's accent in the film of Anglo-American reminded me of Ridley's Anglo-American accent (Ridley you traitor to England!!! The worst is 'Tony' Hopkins to Wales). Actually Ridley, sir, If you are reading this I think you are a superb director and artist and love Blade Runner Bring out that DVD Special soon please. Alien, Gladiator were great as well thanks! Anyway Mr Bloom, please go cry to your best friend Mr Timberlake and talk about mutual self love because there is no love in this review for you.Moving on, I enjoyed the film visually, it was gorgeous, the fight scenes fantastic  although the 'speed up the frames' bit in battles is getting oldwas first in Saving Private Ryan. The acting from everyone was superb except Orlando, and I enjoyed everything about the picture. The problem is in my logical reasoning. What is the point of making this film apart from Gladiator 2 money making hype? What is the point of the film after watching it all the way through? I learnt nothing about the characters they all just went through their motions. This film had no feeling like Gladiator did, that film had a big red gory heart and it was fantastic, and I really wanted to see revenge!! plus that drunken sailor was in it, makes it almost Cult like The crowUnfortunately I might not watch this film again unless I come home at 3am drunk and paralysed with a kebab and throw up on the remote and it turns this crap on and I don't want to touch it so I am forced to endure it again. This film will probably inspire me to faithfully to use my Ebay buying account and purchase myself a Japanese Sword which I can commit suicide with if I have to watch Orlando's impression of 'Keanu Reeves acting like a wooden doll 'acting again. If you have learnt anything class, it should be to:a) Avoid this film b) Watch this film with your Jewish and Muslim friends and tell them afterwards to shake hands and share Jerusalem. c) Never trust a man with a mighty ginger beard, only a normal one. (I am LOTR dwarf reject!) d) If someone offers you everything on a plate (You can be King Balian and have sex with my beautiful sister with my blessing and lead my armies) you DON'T s**t your pants and refuse mate. e) Orlando Bloom should stay where he belongs in Japanese commercials with Bill Murray mocking him. (Lost in translation reference) f) Ridley Scott should never try to follow up any of his movies as they will inevitably and proverbially SUCK. g) Thelma and Louise is GAY!

There is a sense of realism to this film, not a conscious sense of what modern technology can produce for the screen. I went to a late showing, and my only gripe is that it could have used an extra 30 minutes or so. Apparently the director was required to cut as much or more to satisfy the powers that be. When that extended DVD comes out, I'll be in line to buy it. Orlando Bloom can be proud of his portrayal of Balian. He plays the virtuous knight without coming across as too pious or too cynical, a fine line to walk. He is our center in the story, not seeking to win a war, but hoping desperately for a resolution. Loved him, wouldn't want any other actor in the role!Edward Norton is positively fascinating as Baldwin, the leper-king. The supporting cast was great, particularly Saladin, and Jeremy Irons as Tiberius. The zealots were a little over the top, with Marton Csokas practically gnashing his teeth (the villain!) but I even loved to hate him, just as I loved to hate Joaquin Phoenix as the pasty, evil emperor in 'Gladiator.'

537,vaynor,Something of a Bloomer,4,7 October 2005,"Why on earth did a fine director such as Ridley Scott choose Orlando bloom ? He seems to have just one facial expression with just a few minor movements to enhance his acting or rather lack thereof. The cinematography is wonderful. The storyline somewhat distant from great literature to say the least though with some fine dramatic scenes. The actors that surround Orlando bloom perform their roles well with particular fine performances from Jeremy Irons (I am not a fan usually) and Eva Green (how could any man not be a fan). But ultimately the movie must convince or fail on Orlando Blooms performance and his performance begs the question. Whatever happened to leading actors that could carry such an epic lead Charlton Heston, Kirk Douglas, Richard Burton Peter o'Toole to name a few ? Bloom has neither the presence, the physique or the voice. Even his beard is a feeble player in the part. Frankly he would be better suited to the acting the role of a lead singer in a film about a boy band !

538,Edith Keeler,Ridley Scott makes his point,8,7 May 2005,"First off, if you have ever been to Jerusalem, seen pictures of Jerusalem, or know anything about the geography around Jerusalem, close your eyes. I personally think that if Ridley Scott intended to make a movie about the most well known city on earth, he should have at least tried to find a location with somewhat similar geography. It also would have helped to paint his sets' stones the right color -- you know, that honey colored stone that Jerusalem is so very famous for. Instead the city is built on a high round hill. This is supposedly the site of the crucifixion -- wrong. This lone hill is sitting in the middle of a huge flat plain on which Scott can effectively stage Saladin's attack with a few scenic hills in the distance for him to hide behind, followed by another even larger wide open plain. Very wrong. And, oh yes, the Holy Land is all desert. Not rocky, scrubby desert either, but rolling blowing sand dune Lawrence of Arabia style desert. Sorry, I've been there; it just never was like that.Those of you with weak stomachs, go rent Gladiator or Jaws. I personally would have gotten the point just as well if he had cut out 30 to 45 minutes worth of in-your-face gore and splattering guts. I personally wish they would have pulled back a bit during the battle scenes so I could tell what was going on. Getting in so tight is a way to rub the audience's face in the gore of battle and yet not to have to do much tactical or strategic battle layout.That having been said, I do think Ridley Scott had something important to say. And I think he did make his point rather well. That being that actions speak louder than words, that much cowardice and evil go under the banner of religion, and that good and godly men are those who do the right thing. The world can not hear this enough.The acting was very good. Orlando Bloom, is, of course, all over the screen. Liam Neeson is brilliant in his too-short part as Godfrey. David Thewlis also brightens up the screen too briefly as the Hospitaler. Brendon Gleeson is deliciously menacingly insane as the #2 villain Reynold. Unfortunately Eva Green (Sibylla) spends most of the time standing around being seductive. This is not the actress's fault, of course, but the result of decades of Hollywood tradition that dictates that every movie must have a love interest and all heroes must get the girl at the end. In all, she was very shallowly written and had little to do besides stand around reacting.I think this is a very worthwhile movie if you can get past the gore and the inaccuracies.",Kingdom of Heaven
539,mircea_dragan,Worst movie Ridley Scott ever made - but is it his fault?,7,16 May 2005,"So, Alexander was a mistake as far as the epic movies go so what is an epic movies fan to do this year? Well, no worries, KOH is coming out. Gorgeous trailers, intriguing story, not recently explored setting.. best of all directed by Ridley Scott, this guy never did a movie I didn't like. So what can go wrong? Well, maybe Orlando Bloom ? Nah, he can pull it off...to the movies!Well, movie seen, I have to say : excellent camera work, colors, scenery , good (but not great) acting, great score ,battles,FX, ...so what went wrong?The story , that's what's wrong. Having an idiotic story to work with , no matter how good the director, actors or effects , it is almost impossible to pull a great movie. Exceptions exist, but the above is pretty much the rule. There are so many logical inconsistencies, so many moments requiring complete suspense of disbelief, that despite my bias it finally began to drag me and feel like 'Robin Hood: Men in Tights' or other 'funny' movie. And the tragedy is, I didn't come to watch *that* kind of movie. I came to see a gritty , realistic trip into a fascinating age, a fanatical and *maybe* dark one, but also an age that defined many of the values and ideas we Europeans still use.What do I get? Well, here's some 'great' moments (spoilers galore):Balian, the blacksmith of a mountain village looses his wife to suicide and his unborn child with her. Same time, his father , of which B. (presumably) had no idea who he was, returns from crusade and makes himself known to his son. What does Balian in answer to all these? Keeps working the forge and talking banalities with his co-villagers. Business as usual today. OK, so maybe this is how he deals with the pain...move on.-Balian, a 30 something blacksmiths , no previous military training, decides to join his luck with his father, a noble (after some events...)and begins taking sword lessons from him. 2 minutes into the sword lessons the two and their group - roughly 10 people - are attacked by a large group of professional soldiers. Balian wreaks havoc with them...2 minutes into the lesson ? OK, so he was a blacksmith and has strong arms , still no big deal.The ship carrying Balian to Jerusalem is caught in a storm and overturned. Everybody dies. Balian escapes . So what, he's the hero, right? But he also saves his father's sword, important later on. Still, swimming with a 10 pound sword in your arms? A nice black horse also survives ..a HORSE? Shipwrecked in the middle of the sea , everybody dies and a HORSE is saved by a section of the ship floating ashore? No, please..At the Jerusalem's gate: (the single one gate I suppose, otherwise the story makes even less sense): 'You have Godfrey's sword, surely you knew him?''Yes''A tall man?''Yes''Green eyes?'(Pause)'Blue''Then you must be his son. Welcome my lord''No, I just killed him and took his sword.Did noticed he had blue eyes though.' (this line mine, not from the movie...)Just arrived into Jerusalem, the local princess rushes into Balian and begins ogling him. It happens every day there, I hear.Coming into his inheritance, a god-forgotten keep in the middle of the dessert, Balian realizes the place needs water. All the other stupids there, especially the Arabs, didn't realize it for all those years. Well Balian does, and he decides to dig a well, in a random place of his choosing. The rough and brutal knights from Europe, which enslaved the locals, they joyfully join in. The Arab kids, they are all smiles. Kumbayah, my lord, kumbayah.6 feet down, they strike water. Three days later, the place is overgrown with cabbage and stuff. About now my head starts hurting.Balian is now facing his first battle. All his father's old comrades are listening to what he has to say. He takes the logical decision (well, for a youngster with no military experience): we're going to charge headlong into the massed Arabs, just the 20 of us. What do the old soldiers say? Sure, let's die for it.A lot of people die at random and needlessly (no way the Muslim cavalry was about to massacre the Muslim villagers, as the movie implies), Balian escapes. Again.Finally Jerusalem is surrounded , and defenseless ,as best part of the army has been lost to the stupidity of its old , Arab war veterans, professional generals. Who assumes the command of the defense? Balian, the 30 yr old, three months into Holy Land, no previous military experience, not known by anyone in the city, nobody. Does anybody question his qualifications? No. Does anybody in the crowd listening to his less-then-inspired speech says ""But who *are* you?"" in the awkward silence? No! Suddenly he appears to have gotten skills in siege warfare. How? We don't know. And who is he opposed to ? Salah-ed-Din, the best general the Muslims are able to field in the period. And Balian WINS! But why do they fight ? Well, to protect the city, the Jews, Muslims and Christians in it , Balian's saying. But why do they need to be protected? As Salah-ed-Din is saying , he didn't wanted - or needed - to massacre them anyway.Wait, then why did he began by firing a huge barrage of fireballs into the city instead of sending a messenger to say so?...Did no one, from the director to the actors reading their scripts say 'This doesn't make any sense !It needs to be changed so and so!""? Why not? It would have made such a better movie.",Kingdom of Heaven

His father passes on his life's legacy and dreams to Balian, who builds up his father's house, units Muslims and Christians, and becomes the man his father wanted him to be, ultimately saving thousands of people, becoming a hero, and finding the peace he was looking for...great performances from every single actor, and providing enough epic storytelling to talk about for weeks will make this your favorite epic ever made...just don't watch the theatrical cut which took out 45 minutes, a solid ending, and left gigantic gaps in the story.",Kingdom of Heaven
542,djurannikola,"An enjoyable drama of medieval chivalry, sacrifice and asceticism",7,30 September 2014,"Different from historical truth as it was, I thought it a likable movie. Its romantic element somewhat bugs me: Balian first yields to his ""love""(I took it he kinda loved her, anyway) and passion to Sibylla, yet afterward refuses to reign alongside her because he sees it as dishonest to reach the crown and the woman he loves at the cost of the death of Guy - who is his fiercest enemy, a more vile one than Saladin, in fact. While I generally praised Balian for his exposed maturity, sacrifice and, restraint, I felt his sudden ""saintly"" image affected his relationship with other characters in a progressively dulling way: not only was I not sure what exactly he felt for Sibylla but what he felt for Guy and Saladin. I'd say there was a quaint connection between Balian and the late leper king whom he befriended (and whom I consider to be the most elegant, truly regal figure of the movie). While Baldwin IV still held Jerusalem, all other characters, including Balian, appeared appealing, vivid, and dynamic. His death indirectly made Balian's further behavior and actions desperately bland, as if Balian did his best to rely on himself after losing Baldwin's support, but with not much of a success. And, chivalrous as he previously proved to be, I still failed to understand why did the crowd of Jerusalem unanimously accept him as their new ruler.The villains are conceived well enough, especially Guy, my only objection regarding his dubious aftermath when Balian bests him in a sword fight. I think his last appearance should have been the donkey-humiliation by the Saracens. Raynald of Chatillon did not come across as a charismatic villain. Gleeson is evidently as inspired as he could be, but perhaps it's the wrong choice of actor. The characters Gleeson portrays are usually all bumbling, boisterous, thuggish and unrefined. I imagined Raynald as a typically sly and cunning, ""l'eminence grise"" henchman who relies less on brute killings and more on intellectually designing and inspiring them. I also attributed the necessity of portraying Raynald as more sophisticated to the fact that he was the father of the Hungarian Queen Agnes (and, through her, an ancestor of a whole lot of European monarchs and nobles). Then again, I just may not be regarding medieval ""non-romantically"" enough.The epilogue of the siege is fine. I actually thought Saladin made me like the assaulting Saracen party better than the defensive Jerusalem party. For one, Muslims are not portrayed as genocidal monsters (could it be the effect of the aura of an unusually benevolent Arab leader, Saladin, the opposite of an otherwise standard vile Arab leader?).That said, Saladin's image, in a way, outshone Balian's for me. Balian simply fades away into obscurity with Sibylla (did she eventually become his wife, or what?), and then, all anew, follows King Richard into a new Jerusalem tour. I just never get it straight whether he is to be regarded in a warrior/ hero or a semi-saintly context. I definitely found him to be a worthy, exciting protagonist, but most of my confusion over the general theme of the movie was the result of his ambiguous character and prospects. In the long run, perhaps he was simply meant to combine both elements. However, I yet need to re-watch this movie once or a few other times more to judge how effective that fusion was.",Kingdom of Heaven
543,myportal28,An underrated adventure-movie that feels very real and exciting,9,23 December 2009,"""Holiness is in right action and courage on behalf of those who cannot defend themselves"" -Hospitaler 1185 AD- From the director of 'Gladiator' and '1492: Conquest of Paradise' comes this adventurous epic which grabbed me right away with its purity and honest crudity. Those two go together very well in this story about leadership,courage, love and wisdom of the heart.This movie greatly depicts how a hurt blacksmith grows into a true man who knows to heal his wounds and who learns what matters most in life. Orlando Blooms natural innocence and intelligence make him into a suprprising and convincing character. He surprises by undergoing his trails without judgement or emotion and finding the righteous path in a glorious way. Convincing because he acts with a confidence and self-assurance that show that he is a developed soul who is able to read between the lines and act on it in a conscious and creative way that, again, surprises friend as well as foe.I love watching these kind of heroic epics not in the least because of the great images they provide. 'Kingdom of Heaven' is no exception and shows wonderful landscapes and enchanting scenery that creates feelings of freedom and splendor. Except for 'Gladiator', 'Braveheart' and a few others, movies like these are often underrated and that is truly a shame. The story, the camera-work, the environment and the dialogues are all very sophisticated and inspiring and make me honour this splendid movie with a 9 rating. Enjoy!",Kingdom of Heaven
544,tenacious00,"""People will not say, 'Here it is,' or 'There it is,' because the Kingdom of God is within you."" Luke 17:20-21",7,10 January 2014,"Watched directors cut version recently and could not hold myself from writing review. Good film which could potentially become everlasting masterpiece ended up as just ""worth watching""In brief. Contras:Portrayal of Christian Church and clergy as greedy, corrupt and deceitful. Did all priests order to behead suicides or quickly jump into Islam when enemy was in hindsight? True, Torquemada, Kramer Henricus and Pope Gregory IX had their names related to Christ. So were St. Augustine, St. Peter, Savonarola, Blaise Pascal and many others.On the contrary Islam is given too fair and may be even biased go. Muslims are re-claiming Jerusalem as if they were returning to their backyard.The backyard built by Judaic, Roman gods and Christ followers? Hmmmmmmm.. Historical facts are far fetched and twisted, sometimes I suppose for commercial purposes. There are no historical traces of sexual affair between Balian and Sibylla. The bed scenes are absolute pollutants. What for?This is not ""Blade Runner""! Increase female patronage to cinemas to pay off original budget?Balian and Patriarch Heraclius worked with each other to rescue Jerusalem from invaders.They never disputed , never mind Balian's blasphemy speeches. Patriarch was the one who proposed rescue of people offset surrender of city. So Balian can be portrayed as solely secular leader? He never was!Pros:Energizing works of cast: Liam N, Orlando B., Jeremy I., Eva G., David T, Ghassan M. etc etc Special thank for Ridley Scott and William Monahan for scenario and director work. Wow!!!! Balian who never was blacksmith still inspires in this story. Godfrey De Ibelin teachings. King Baldwin preaching. Scenes of defense, negotiations and surrender of Jerusalem, both on Christian and Islamic sides. Queen of Jerusalem has cut her hairs and is treating wounds of injured defenders. She is the one walking on foot from Jerusalem and here goes horse from blacksmith. Etc etc etc the number of astonishing and inspirational scenes is countless. Well thought and played, these pieces of art are shining!Messages. Yes,and so many of them! There are few to mention.Power corrupts everything. Even in Holy Jerusalem there are fights for throne and ascendancy. True to historical facts, barons attacked peaceful Muslims and plotted against each other. Well of course except Balian, whose conciseness can be cleared. ( Not exactly true due to other events in his actual life further on). Well how can anyone involved escape power fight without blemishes?The sub plot of Balian looking to redeem his sins, heal his sorrows and connect to Jesus. True, so many of us may not find path to Lord via church rites. Does it mean that Lord refused to know us or does not exist at all? Mother Tereza diaries describe her in a stage of ""spiritual dryness"" and even denial of God's existence! Yet Jesus called her to slums of Calcutta to help poor and desolate. Popes and Presidents paid homage to her. ""I put no stock in religion. By the word religion I have seen the lunacy of fanatics of every denomination be called the will of god. I have seen too much religion in the eyes of too many murderers. Holiness is in right action, and courage on behalf of those who cannot defend themselves, and goodness"" (Hospitaler) Balian has thrown grenade into bush and Lord has not spoken to him from it. Guess who sent Hospitaler to talk to Balian? Even with the strongest blessings you can not win Hattin battle in desert without water. So are knowledge, common sense and science God's sent? This is where film is radiating. Religious institutions ( without detriment to Holy Farthers like Paul the Apostle, St. Joseph, John the Baptist etc etc) may not hold monopoly on Kingdom of Heaven. Well, Lord does.Finale of this spectacle left me in question about Balian's and Sibylla's faith or denial. Is it for ""pros"" or for ""contras""? Black and white only? How many colors rainbows have? Well, Balian is just another of us, sheep, stuck in our quirks, frustrations and complains. But we must not succumb to them and seek relentlessly faith and His Almighty in our lives. Just wait for that call for right action to come. And here goes courage and bravery for the former lame and weak. May be like reluctant Moses leading Jews from Egypt you may be told to lead columns of Christians from Jerusalem back to Europe Sorry to everybody who molded this film.

546,skard42,"Could have been great, but wasn't",4,8 May 2005,"I saw this movie yesterday, and I was disappointed. It could have been a really good movie, but it fell quite short. There were flashes of brilliance, and the overall message and plot line were good, but the details bogged the movie down.The fault lies in the directing and the editing. Many scenes, especially early in the movie were either trimmed too much, so that they jumped around in a very confusing way, or else they dragged on too long, adding unnecessary details, although mostly the former. The jumps in scenes came at bad places, too, with no transition at all. Worse still was some of the horrible lines in the dialog. They stretched plausibility and insulted the intelligence of the audience. Furthermore, I am really not a fan of the camera weaving around the until you feel queasy, get a head-ache, and have no idea what is happening. The rest of the battle scenes are actually quite good, but when they start moving the camera wildly, it detracted too much from them. Finally, the character development left quite a bit to be desired. Balian killed a priest just for making crude comments about his dead wife, but won't allow himself to be a part of the death of a man he knows deserves it, even though that death will benefit Balian and everyone he cares about greatly? This is one of many parts of the movie that stretch credulity too far. I don't need complete verisimilitude in my movies, but it would be nice to not make the stretches too obvious. The flaws aren't completely fatal, but they are disappointing, considering that with a few better decisions, this could have been a truly good movie. The main geopolitical, ideological, religious, and social points are relatively good, and well expressed, although somewhat anachronistic for the time. Some bending of history is to be expected, it is Hollywood, after all. But, the premise of how the self-interest of the major players can impact the lives of ""little people"" is accurate.

547,rojobermejo,Excellent Production,8,15 May 2005,"After having demonstrated his great abilities with his Oscar-winning hit movie, ""Gladiator"", Scott now knows how to handle mass scenes in big productions. Even in this epic that does not seem to have a definite structure, with a story line that does not grab the viewer, Scott still captivates via an excellent production. He appears to be more concerned with the photography, cameras up on cranes, and aerial shots for an accurate view of the great battles with pertinent editing. He is very careful with the acting, the music score is excellent, the costumes entirely credible, as are the settings with backgrounds of the prodigious Arab architecture, settings scrupulously chosen or created, that transport us to the Middle East in 1184.",Kingdom of Heaven
548,Wyldesteele,I went to see this at my own risk but still feel cheated,4,4 May 2005,"1st thing that comes to mind is: Why is Orlando ""No charisma"" Bloom in these movies? I love historical settings and I'll be DAMNED if I see his face ever again in these type of movies that have the potential to be good. And of course his 'character', though a blacksmith, is the perfect fighter after only a couple of two-minute lessons of swordsmanship. Not to mention morally impeccable. Second thing: This film is full of clichés. The more films you have seen in your life, the more likely you are to be irritated. Like the quick close-up of the princess watching over the walls and whispering to himself: 'Saladin'. How many times have you seen that?! Why do they still have that whispering-close-up? Yes, we know who is behind the walls, Saladin yes, and what he's about to do, attack. Yes, thank you for underlining it once more. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly: The characters are shallow (with a few expectations). You don't care what happens to them. They don't feel like real, human beings. On the pro-side, a couple of the fight scenes are good and to me, because I'm fascinated by history, there were some short moments that caught my eye and were appealing. And of course, the muslims speak mostly English to each other. How it adds to the realism, whoppee. But summa summarum, almost everything in this movie leaves sth to be desired. Jeremy Irons is OK as he usually is but Liam Neeson (though a good actor) is, well, just Liam Neeson.

Some are major and some are small, but they all contribute to making this movie a disappointment.It's too bad that Orlando Bloom's best acting job comes from a movie such as this.

If you go see this movie expecting a Gladiator, you will be extremely disappointed because this movie flat out sucks and was nothing like it. The preview made it look very promising, but in all honesty, you guessed it, it sucked. Picture this: you're sitting in a movie theater watching this movie... you get quiet in the beginning and prepare yourself for what you think will be a good movie so you pay close attention... a few swords swing in the beginning and you're kinda like ""cool""... then you expect something to happen after that and for the story to get better... so you wait, and wait, and wait... few things happen that could have been cool but weren't... then the movie ends.

553,peppe80,"Don't compare to Gladiator, it's not a hero-movie!",8,7 May 2005,"Before seeing this movie I thought everybody would compare the KOH to Gldiator or to Alexander. I try to contrast them but in vain. They are 3 very different movies.The Gladiator is a typical hero-movie, it made a star from Russel Crowe and I think it was one of the first costume story of the 21st century packing wonderful special effects. I fell a victim to these fabulous story's charms! The Alexander is based on the spiritual and sexual personality. But the film fell prey to Oliver Stone's big hurry. This movie's story  as well as the KOH's  had lots of unexploited potentialities. Farrel played quite well, he might have played Balian's role better than Bloom did. The KOH might have a message to people of present. The peace and the peacefully living side by side is much more valuable than the different religions. (Just look the situation in Near East.) Bloom wasn't a hero like Crowe, but he should have played more genuine in Balians role. Something more about the KOH: Firstly I have to lay down: I really don't like Orlando Bloom. (Only reason made me watch the movie: the director Ridley Scott) I've seen two films with Blooms participation  Pirate of the C. and Troy  but I don't remember his charismatic sharing at all. Bloom was a wrong alternative for the leading role. Apart from this the supporting actors carried out they entrusted function quite nicely. So I was very disappointed when Neeson and Irons had to left the scene. As other users have mentioned both of them could invigorate the whole production. (I've seen this movie dubbed, so I couldn't hear Edward Nortons Godfather-like voice. I couldn't even recognized him behind the mask, only after the movie I discovered in a booklet that Edward played the leper King of Jerusalem.) The sound design and the battles composing to the score was excellent. At the first little scrum I knew: that's why I like Scotts actions! Summarizing this movie: apart from the too religious and sometimes strange dialogues, from Blooms weak performance the image of this film is considerably good. So I gave an 8.",Kingdom of Heaven
554,sublunari,"A beautiful movie, but short on just about everything else",8,27 October 2005,"Practically every shot in Kingdom of Heaven is beautiful. From the beginning, where we see snowflakes before seeing the landscape, to the middle, where we see a small mouse crawl inside and out a firelit pair of shoes, to the end, where Saladin picks up a fallen cross beside a red drape billowing in the wind, we feel we are viewing a work of art. Furthermore, this world being shown to us is one we really cannot see anywhere else--the pictures and books do not make the world seem real, while many other films that try to portray this historic era (or any era for that matter) frequently do so incorrectly. Not so with Kingdom of Heaven. To me, this seems like the definitive portrayal of Crusading Europe, at least as good as Bergman's masterpiece, The Seventh Seal, but on an epic scale. It's a world we really can't see anywhere else, and that is the greatest achievement this film makes, and that's why I believe it is well worth watching. The sound design is also very impressive. Balls of fire sound like choruses of men (a hint of Gladiator's opening scene), and the swarms of arrows do actually whistle. There's also a Wilhem scream thrown in for good measure.However, let's face it, Balian is a boring character. All of his dialogue could probably fit on a single page--a double-spaced page! When he first meets the King of Jerusalem, Baldwin IV, he says only two words: ""I will."" Baldwin is practically making a soliloquy in that scene. The idea goes that Balian is a perfect knight incapable of doing something that is wrong, and although I suppose this is a noble idea in real life, it does not translate well to a work of drama. For example, wouldn't this movie have been more fun if Balian had screwed over absolutely everyone he met? Or if he had started out as the good guy, but slowly degenerated into an evil maniac? I just don't really care about him. I'm not interested in what he has to say. I have much more fun when I hear any of the characters around him speaking, in fact, this movie would definitely have been far better had it centered on Sybilla, Baldwin, Tiberias, Saladin, or the Hospitalier--it falls into the trap of the main character being hollow and empty, practically robotic, while the people around him are very much human, if a little too Shakespearean. I feel like this also happened in Gladiator, but to a more limited extent. Maximus was definitely very human, just kind of quiet and brooding. Balian is a quiet robot.Briefly: far too many of the scenes are straight out of Gladiator. It's almost like KOH is just a reorganized version of Gladiator. Sybilla even looks like Lucilla, and their characters are both largely depressed and angry through both films. Christ (pun intended), their names look the same.As for the acting, the players are good, but seem to struggle at times to work with the lines that are given to them. Many of the spoken words just sound cool, but are completely meaningless. ""Because between two people, there is only a candle."" ""A Queen does not walk, yet you are walking."" ""Jerusalem is worth nothing, and everything."" These people lived in a world of unimaginable strain, torment, and misery--you think they could find more interesting, meaningful things to say to each other, since, as we all know, misery loves company. The Muslims are incredibly cool sounding, and looking--when we first see Saladin, he does this weird thing where he turns his horse around both ways as he comes at the camera, and it definitely contributes to his mythical status. All the characters are fun to watch, but it's annoying to see so many of them reduced to plot devices: assistants who explain to the audience what is happening through telling the leader what he in all likelihood already knows (i.e., German guy to Balian, Tiberias to Baldwin, Arabian nobleman to Saladin). It happens all the time in KOH, and all the time in Gladiator. Finally, the writing does not sound human. It sounds Shakespearean, but Monahan (the writer) is not Shakespeare, so naturally it doesn't work. Also, French people have British accents. I think the solution would have been for them all to speak French and Arabic, as they would have spoken, but this would have involved subtitling the movie, thereby (theoretically) cutting the American audience in half, unless the movie is about Jesus, since our society is becoming increasingly illiterate and fanatical.Anyway, sweeping generalizations aside, I'm a history fanatic, so I can forgive this movie for its faults, and although I doubt I'll ever buy it, I watched it twice when I rented it, and I'll probably rent it again sometime. There are better historical movies out there, but this one is much more well-made than a good deal of the genre.",Kingdom of Heaven
555,nazgul748,Enemies of Orlando beware!!!!,9,7 May 2005,"I went to see this film prepared to be disappointed. I like Bloom as an actor but I was skeptical regarding his ability to pull off the leading role in an epic film. Fortunantly my fears were unfounded. Bloom did an excellent job. The supporting actors that stood out most in my mind were Alexander Siddig and Marton Csokas. Liam Neeson and Jeremy Irons had limited roles but their performances were, as always, of the highest quality. I have read many negative comments about Bloom's ability to play the lead in a major film. Bloom's detractors fail to realize that Orlando is an actor of the old school type. Reference the old black and white films that required actors to act with their bodies and expressions in addition to being able to spout well written lines. So enemies of Orlando beware, you may have a surprise in store if you go see this film. My most pleasant surprise was Scott's portrayal of the Muslim people. He showed them to an honorable and noble people fighting for their beliefs just as the Christians fought for theirs. A remarkable film all the way around. Worth seeing twice.",Kingdom of Heaven
556,stuart_heinrich,Pumped out of the assembly line,4,16 August 2006,"Don't be fooled by the high rating on this film, it's no cinematic masterpiece. Although it is clearly a top-budget film, with good props and scenes, it tries way too hard to be a profound and moving epic. Instead, it appears to have been constructed within the recent Hollywood Middle-Ages-Assembly-Line. It is very similar in presentation and unwatchability to the recent King Arthur movie.They have a very simple formula for introducing new characters and for character development. They simply devote a 5 minute scene to having the character give Bloom another lecture on how following your heart makes you a good person, and then proceed to devote themselves to him for no apparent reason. Literally, this is how Liam Nieson, Edward Norton, and David Thewlis' characters are presented! Bloom plays the same role he always does: a handsome young blacksmith who is good with horses and is desired by the girl. What a surprise. He doesn't talk much, and like all the other characters, has no clear sense of purpose. This is evident in the dialog, which is filled with corny remarks like ""how can you be in hell, when you are in my heart?""",Kingdom of Heaven
557,TheNFV,Kingdom of Boredom,4,7 May 2005,"What is Jerusalem worth? Not much in this epic. With men such as Liam Neeson, Orlando Bloom, and Jeremy Irons playing the lead roles, one would belief this to be possibly one of the better of the recent epic piles of big-budget scrapheaps, such as the lackluster King Arthur or downright-awful Alexander. This assumption, however, is wrong. Kingdom of Heaven is two hours and about 25 minutes in length. It is only those last twenty five minutes that are actually devoted to the battle for Jerusalem; The rest is random clips strung together with the hope of converting a few years into two hours, which rarely ever works. The editing of this story is the main problem in addition to the lack of flow to the tale. Jumping from some European country then heading west to where the men speak Italian then heading further on to where they speak something, the story's structure is like a ten year old recalling his or her history lesson for the entire school semester in a minute. Orlando Bloom, whose father is played by one of the better actors in this movie, meets up with dear old dad to go on a crusade only to have dear old dad get mortally wounded. Jump forward around who knows how many months to the group at Messina with Neelson clinging to life. From here, Bloom is knighted and heads to Israel to take over his dead daddy's business, protecting the king. The trip from Messina to Israel is summed up in one bad, stormy night in which his tiny ship is destroyed and capsized. Bloom wakes up perfectly fine on the beaches of Israel. Upon walking through the mountains of his drowned comrades, he discovers the only other survivor, a black steed. The steed, trapped in one large, almost untouched section of the ship which the rest of litters the beach like the fallen comrades, runs off shortly after being freed only to be captured later on after Bloom's short (one scene) romp through the desert to an oasis. Then the first duel of the movie ensues and Bloom's character moves on to Jersualem. Finally, after months and months of... wait, it's only been a little more than twenty minutes? Ignoring the movie magic of cutting out the mundaneness of the journey, the story would be fine. Unfortunately, Scott decided to spend another twenty minutes on Bloom, who is now a Barron, and his newly inherited lands as they dig for water. This attempt at building up Bloom's character as a man of the people is actually played out in almost every scene the man is in. Had Scott spent more time on Bloom's character's struggle with the fact he's in Jersualem for forgiveness for his wife and his sins and not on Bloom hooking up with the King's sister and having some random kid interrupt him every few scenes, then the movie would have been a bit less dull and dry like the desert in which it is placed.The battles are all very small, ranging from a duel to a small band of men versus another small band, up until the final battle for Jersualem. Ridley Scott, for some reason, decided to tempt the viewers with both the army of Christians and the army of Muslims under Saladin - played one of the other better than Bloom actors, Ghassan Massoud - meeting in full fledged battle gear outside of Kerak only to agree to part ways in order to keep the struggling peace. Eventually, the king dies from leprosy and the new king Guy De Lusignan, played by Marton Csokas, takes over. Guy wants war and so he sends out the Templars to start war because God wills it. Well, apparently Scott willed it that the actual battle between army of Christians and the Army of Muslims would not be seen as he only has the aftermath shown through the eyes of Bloom's character. To call this movie an epic about the second Crusade and not show the most important part of the crusade and instead spend time on digging up water is just like putting a toy car in a monster truck rally; the outcome isn't pretty.To be far to Scott as he did bring us Gladiator, Scott does include several scenes reminiscent of his last epic as well as gives an interesting final battle that rivals any LOTR battle in any of the three, but to have just this battle in the movie and for it to be two hours and 25 minutes is inexcusable. The movie was actually an hour and a half, but with all the needless kids running and random people running around instead of focusing on just the main characters the movie became longer. Ridley Scott, although providing us with the best epic thus far in the recent years, fails to deliver another Gladiator. Jeremy Irons tells Bloom's character that there is no need for real knights in Jersualem just like there is no need to see this movie unless you're in need of sleep.",Kingdom of Heaven

559,prystalcage,Well Done! Go Change the World,8,31 May 2005,"This movie wasn't made to be compared with the Gladiator. This is what my friends expected going in.I would compare it to a modern attempt at a Battle of Algiers approach. Both sides are seen having a faction of extremist, both sides show mercy. It is poetic in its insistence that every individual is responsible for their own actions.The king states, paraphrased: ""A King can move a man, but the soul is still the man's. When you stand before God you can't say people made me do this or virtue wasn't convenient at the time."" Further a priest states, also paraphrased: I don't place stock in religion. What God wants is right action. He wants this-pointing to the head-and this-pointing to the heart. Protect the defenseless. This film really aims at showing the commonalities of religion; that is humanity. All want to do God's will, sometime for the wrong reasons, but they all wish to do what they think is best--The only failing here is a ""bad"" character who states, that he is what he is. It is as if he knows that he's bad--Some believe that Bailey's character was painted as innocent. However, I would disagree. He is seen not only killing a priest, but having sex with a married woman something of a sin and a crime in 1184. We as modern viewers may overlook this simply as passion, but passion not directed at the Lord--in those times--was wrongful.The large battle scenes included some cool special effects, but similar to Alexander they tend to lose focus--NB this movie is far better than Alexander...far better. The editing of the rest of the story is fairly strong but unlike Lord of the Rings or Star Wars we lose track of the characters in war scenes, that were given attention elsewhere. Unfortunately, this editing choice could only be justified if we stayed with the protagonists at all times and yet we don't.I really enjoyed the story, the performances of the actor's and the messages that I took away from the movie. If you are looking for gore you get it in this movie--though you often don't see the last chop of a head, or other body part. But if you are looking for an action film you best move on comparable with the Gladiator, you best move on.",Kingdom of Heaven
560,fragbait,"Not bad, but not good either.",5,12 May 2005,"So, out comes a new film, directed by Ridley Scott. An IMDb score of 7.0? I went into the movie last Saturday. And here comes my review of:---KINGDOM OF HEAVENS (2005) directed by Ridley Scott---Should you go watch it for history reasons?I don't know if the movie is historically correct, but I doubt it. That's not too much of a sacrilege, though, because 90% of all movies that claim to be based on historical facts have their flaws.So, what's then to like about it?With good illumination and excellent Arabian actors, the film creates a quite different image of the crusades than what one might expect. It doesn't depict the Crusaders as the good guys (though there are some honorables amongst them), but as mean, greedy for power, and so eager to begin a bloodshed that it's disgusting. The Saracens however are depicted as mostly honorable, fair, and just. They act the way they do because they have to, and they do it with dignity.Sounds good, no? What are the cons, and why does this film get no more than a '5'?To be honest, the biggest con of this film is the cast and depiction of its main actor. Orlando Bloom is not a great representative of his profession, and I think he knows this as well as Mr. Scott. The casting was done by Debra Zane, I think, and this time she placed popularity over class. Mr. Bloom is never convincing in his role, neither as blacksmith nor as knight apprentice, nor as defender of Jerusalem. This is due to his cute and youngish appearance (don't get me wrong - the make-up artists did all what they could to make him look rugged and battered), and his failure to express different emotional conditions. But he doesn't screw it up alone. I don't know what the script writer thought, but this character is the 'whitest' of all heroes I've ever seen. He kills a corrupted priest for reasons everybody can understand. He rides with the crusaders, and within 10 minutes of the film, he is maybe the most skilled knight out there. He inherits the small shire of his father, and the first thing he does is he has a well dug out - as if nobody before ever had such a brilliant idea. After that the land perks up. He is just human enough to sleep with a beautiful woman who is already engaged, just to regret it later. He defends the unguarded Jerusalem twice, once before the crusader army arrives, and one more time in the end. He refuses to take part in an intrigue, which could have led to the better, just because it is morally wrong. Let's leave it at that - he is just so white, it looks like he has been washed with some oxy-action washing powder. Apart from its hero, the film is - well - quite okay. It may be a bit gory at times, but then again - that's how the crusades had been.So, should I watch it?If you like historical movies, but don't want them to go too deep underneath the surface, go watch this film. If you like Orlando Bloom, and adore the one expression his face can render, go watch this film. If you want to see Saracens for once depicted as good, go watch this film.If none of the above facts holds true for you, don't go into this movie. It's exaggeratedly heroic, quite gory and at times probably not historically correct. Overmore, the acting of its main protagonist isn't really worth seeing.Decide for yourself, but I will give this film 5 out of 10 points.",Kingdom of Heaven

I loved it, it is a tremendous study of the events, philosophies, and honor of the people who fought this episode of the unrelenting struggle we face today.The portrayal of moderate Saladin, plagued with his Hashashin adviser, mirrors the moderate Leper King beset with his Templar fanatics.There were those in the middle.There were good men who died protecting people, not stones.For if the Kingdom of Heaven is one of conscience, ideals, and choice, then this film truly embraces that understanding.

562,Dynerax,Beautiful Disaster,2,23 September 2005,"Fans of Ridley Scott know what to expect; great visuals with loads of factual and continuity errors. He's been lucky before with strong story and performances from Crowe in Gladiator and this film has all the elements of a fantastic epic but barely reaches the level of direct to DVD release.While sets and costumes are exceptional and the battle scenes epic in scope, I found myself not caring at all. The story is predictable beyond the normal clichés, with the usual and blatant tugs at the heart strings - but even these fail to deliver, not even close. Even girlfriends who watch this aren't moved by Orlando's presence. It's all just uninspired and simply a boring mess.Liam Neesen's performance is the same role we've seen him in countless times; the battle-hardened sage. Luckily, we don't see much of him. Bloom's performance should be interesting but lacks direction, a common flaw in Scott's films.Jeremy Irons is the only slightly character but is so brief that it's hardly noticed.The score in uninspired and lacks cohesion.

563,tonegrina,Ridley Scott could do sooo much better,5,15 May 2005,"I was terribly disappointed with this film. I already knew Orlando Bloom would not be able to carry a film like this, but the reviews hadn't been that bad. There were a few good things: The cinematography, the costumes, and special effects of the battle-scenes were very well done, and the soundtrack was fantastic - like in most of Scott's films. However, this is not enough to make KOH worth seeing. The screenplay was pitiful, with the person who was supposed to be the main character uttering mainly one-liners until right before the final battle for Jerusalem. The ""love-story"" was not very convincing, even though I liked Eva Green as Sibylla. Bloom needs at least ten more years of working as an actor to take on leads like this - and maybe he will never be able too. There can only be one reason for choosing him, and that's his pretty face. Other actors did a decent job, but nobody really stood out. I also found some elements of the story very strange - like that Balians father had evidently never bothered to dig a well on his dry property, but that his son did so successfully within days of his arrival. Furthermore there were no scenes of conversation between the main characters that made you sympathetic towards them (except for maybe the leopard-king), so in the end I didn't really care whether they lived or died. To be a Ridley Scott-movie, this was highly disappointing.",Kingdom of Heaven

While this move is constantly compared to Gladiator, there is no basses for that comparison. This movie starts off extremely slow. There is little semblance of a solid linked plot-line, and the movie tries to shove way to much extra information into your head throughout. The little anecdotes would have been nice if they were followed up on, but throughout the flic, we are told of little bits and pieces of information that are then just passed on. On top of that, the film tried so hard to stay ""in the middle"" of the crusades debate that it completely misses the realities of how gruesome and needless the entire event was. Where as Gladiator showed an (historical accurate) honest portrayal of all sides of the situation, Kingdom just skips the facts that this was a battle between two nearly identical religions, born from one starting point, in an all out race to see who could convert the most ""non-believers"" that didn't want anything to do with ether religion. Instead, it puts an emphasis on a lost-cause storyline broken by action scenes of epic proportions.",Kingdom of Heaven
565,Discfreak,anachronisms,6,10 May 2005,"They were a small and perhaps easily missed, but the inconsistencies inthis movie kept me from enjoying it. The scene which was the worst for me in this regard was when Balian first meets the king of Jerusalem. He enters in silence, the King is seated and speaks first and informally. Balian never makes any acts of obeisance and even after sitting with the king over the chessboard he stands abruptly without so much as a by your leave. I realize this is an informal meeting behind closed doors and this is an unusual king but this behavior was very odd to me. Also the very beginning of the movie was quite jarring to me. We are introduced to an interesting group of characters in the party who come to France with Liam Neeson. In the clash with the Bishop's guards the German and the Moor are both killed and Liam is mortally wounded. I get that this movie is obsessively focused on Balian, but I found myself wondering about the stories of these other men. I was more interested in Liam and his supporting cast than Balian and his adventures. I think the lack of supporting cast made Balian harder to identify with for me. Jeremy Irons was great as Tiberius, but he didn't add anything to the Hero story. As far as Balian's men at arms go we never even learn any of their names and they have no moments of their own. I realize the movie is already 2hrs 25 mins, but I sorely missed the element of at least ONE fellow with a story. Overall not bad, but not worthy of the hype it's getting.",Kingdom of Heaven
566,sassbox222,PC but still entertaining,6,13 August 2005,"I should've hated Kingdom of Heaven more than I did. There's a lot to dislike about this film, but I found it entertaining nonetheless. I'm not really sure why.First the bad. Orlando Bloom is a cutie and a decent actor, but he just does not have the chops yet to play the leading role in an action movie. He doesn't ruin the role of Balian, but so many other actors could've done a better job with that part. On the other hand, Ed Norton gives a great performance and Massoud makes an impressive debut into American cinema.The movie has been very controversial for how it depicts Muslims and Christians. I thought KOH tried way too hard to be politically correct and in the end is just offensive to Christians. The only clerics in the film are shown as scumbags. First there's the priest who desecrates Balian's wife's corpse and taunts him. Then we see a zombie-like monk at Messina saying it is OK to kill infidels. Finally there is the cowardly bishop of Jerusalem who would rather surrender and give up his faith than keep fighting. Never are we shown a churchman who is decent, noble, or moral. Imagine if the movie had turned the tables and shown Muslim clerics in such a negative light.The two main villains of the film are Christians, although they are not terribly devout. They are typical, one-dimensional, movie bad guys. They have no counterparts on the Muslim side. One of Saladin's assistants is a weak attempt at showing a Muslim bad guy, but he pales in comparison to the brutality of Guy and the other bad crusader (forgot the name).The only heroes of the movie are either anachronistically secular (Balian and his father) or Muslim, i.e., Saladin. In reality, medieval Christians did view Saladin as a noble warrior - this depiction of him is not a problem. What is problematic is that KOH makes no effort to depict a similarly noble Christian. In the end, the movie is very one-sided and comes off as more Hollywood Christian bashing. Frankly, that stuff is getting old.Yet despite all of the PC and the average performances, I still enjoyed KOH. Maybe I'm just a sucker for lush historic costumes and sets. Maybe I'm just a sucker for Orlando Bloom. The plot of the movie is silly at times and has many holes in it. But somehow it all comes together and works in a stupid way. It's entertaining - you care about the characters and are at least interested enough to see what happens to them. There are worse ways to spend 2.5 hours on Saturday afternoon than watching KOH. I probably wouldn't watch it again but I'm not bitter that I spent eight bucks on it either. That's more than I can say for many other movies out there.",Kingdom of Heaven
567,stemd03,"Good movie, but you need not be an Aetheist",10,8 May 2005,"Although I highly enjoyed this movie, you need to have faith in some form of God to enjoy it. Aetheists will not like the message because the message of the movie because the theme is, trust in God. As for the actual movie, I thought that a lot of it was surprising, in a good way. Not a lot of meaningless action, fighting for the sake of making a fighting movie, and clichés although almost present seem to have been avoided. Characters were actually intelligent and not the typical one vilified side versus one ultimate good. In fact in the movie you see that both sides have heroes and both sides have villains. The female lead's story is not developed well but this seems like something that will be added in the director's cut. The only real complaints about the movie is the climactic speech given by Bloom, which was probably the movie company telling Scott that ""Braveheart sells"". Also, there was one line which was directly out of Lord of the Rings, which I just thought was in poor taste not to catch it, but that's just me. Also, my buddy who is a medieval history specialist said everything was pretty accurate and would use the movie to teach things about medieval times in his classroom.

Battles weren't given much attention in this movie as it focused more on the events and that's what makes it unique.Watching this movie was to me like a journey back to the present. It tells a story that happened about 1000 years ago and yet has huge resemblance with what's happening today. With the ongoing war in Iraq and the Middle Eastern conflict the subject of the crusades may be very controversial, therefore the movie tried and succeeded in showing a balanced point of view without changing the history (and here I mean the main historical events).Ridley Scott once again proved how good he is. I also have to mention here the sound track which is great (thanks to Harry Gregson-Williams).Kingdom of Heaven is a great movie with a greater message that came just about the right time.",Kingdom of Heaven
569,wulfhere,PC Kingdom of Evil Christians,7,10 May 2005,"I would have enjoyed Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven more had I watched it without the sound; it's a feast for the eyes. But there are problems.First of all, there's Orlando Bloom. He's pretty but terribly boring. Liam Neeson would have made a much better main character. When Neeson waxes grandiloquent, you feel inspired; when Bloom does it, you go buy more popcorn. And when it comes to battle, Bloom simply lacks the physicality to pull it off. What is he, five four? Then there is the ubiquitous and heavy-handed humanism. The clergymen are sadistic cretins, cynical degenerates, or subscribe to a moral code all their own--yet remarkably similar to Dr. Phil's. Meanwhile, the rest of the inhabitants of the Kingdom of Heaven--Christians, Jews, and Muslims--would surely get along swimmingly were it not for those darned Templars who are always trying to stir up strife, presumably because they just love to fight enormous Muslim armies. As I understand it, the 12th Century was a time of superstition and universal bigotry, yet the attitudes of many of the characters would make Voltaire seem like a chauvinist. It's not that you can't have decent, compassionate characters in a medieval drama, but I would prefer to see their decency and compassion than hear them talk about it in anachronistic ways.There are good battle scenes and bad in this film. I actually enjoyed some of the more unrealistic moments just because they were done so well. But one thing that bothered me was the way in which several characters went to face death with a composure bordering on disinterest. I have to get drunk to go to the dentist, so, while beings may well exist who are possessed of unflappable phlegmaticism in the face of grave peril, I remain agnostic. Equally unfathomable is how Bloom's character becomes an apparent expert at all aspects of military science after one thirty-second lesson in swordplay. It would have been refreshing and interesting to see Balian turn to others for help and expertise at some point instead of doing everything himself.Finally, there is a rambling quality to the narrative that I found a bit taxing. There are scenes that seem hardly necessary, and lots and lots of pontificating. (It's always nice when the viewer doesn't have to figure out the moral complexities for himself.) It's better than the soap operatic tableaux of Gladiator, but hardly edge-of-your-seat stuff.

One thing I liked about it was it actually used Muslim people to play the Muslims! I also liked how it made you feel like you were really in the 12th century. The battle scenes were awesome, especially the one when Balian led his 100 or so knights on horseback against like 5,000 horses. The only part I didn't like was the part when they were discussing whether or not to go to war, and Guy's side wanted to go to war, and Tiberius' side didn't. It looked like a scene out of South Park. When they were saying stuff like 'Blasphomy' and stuff. It was probably just me, but I thought that scene was unintentionally funny. The rest of the movie was very good, and the siege of Jerusalem was awesome, especially when they knocked down the siege towers.

Mind you, K.O.H, compared to some of the ones mentioned previously is rather acceptable, but that's not saying much considering their atrocious quality. Any film by Ridley Scott carries with it certain hype and expectation, and rightly so if you look at all the brilliant films he's responsible for. However, he fails on almost all counts with this one. Historically it is way, way off. The main flaw being in the central character, Balian who in the film is portrayed as a kind, heroic and brave crusade. This couldn't be further from the truth seeing as history books, depict him as a tyrant and heavy drinker who butchered Muslims in Arabia. Scott's choice of actor for the role of Balian is also a bit mystifying. Surely he could have found someone a bit more manly, who has actually gone through puberty, instead of pretty-boy Bloom, who has probably never shaved before in his life. The only redeeming feature of the film is the fact that Liam Neeson is in it although this is short lived as he's killed off within the first 20 minutes. I don't want to sound like a cynic but no epic will ever be able to match Gladiator, Spartacus and Ben-Hur, so directors out there: STOP TRYING!!!!",Kingdom of Heaven

Ridley Scott really knows how to build a world on screen. He's my favorite director. The movie starts with our hero Balian and his place in the crusades. The Crusades has a really vast history to ever be put on a 2 and1/2 hour movie, but Ridley Scott tries it well. After encountering soldiers in a forest fight, desert storms and oceanic hurricanes, the Act II carries outs itself into motion. The best characters you will find in the movie are Balian (Orlando Bloom in his best role since LOTR), Godfrey (Liam Neeson in a small but memorable role), Tiberias (Jeremy Irons, great actor) Sibylla (Eva Green wonderful actress) Saladin (Ghassan Massoud doing a great conflicting character), and the other supporting cast like King Baldwin (played by Edward Norton). The screenplay carries depth, along with the Art Direction, Visual Effects, Sound, Cinematography, Editing and Direction. It unfolds pretty well in the last half hour of the film. but the only thing that let me down in the film was the fast pace which made the film look really relentless in the editing room. Even though the film doesn't look like its in the league of Gladiator, its still an adventurous and moving authentic tale.

576,Unknown_Glyph,"""A"" movie potential but ""TV"" movie result.",7,24 October 2005,"A knight (Liam Neelson) returns to France to seek out his bastard whom he never met. He finds his son (Orlando Bloom), a blacksmith, who just lost his wife who killed herself because her baby was lost. The knight tells the blacksmith he owes him a debt and his way of paying him back is taking him to Jerusalem. The blacksmith declines the offer and remains in his small town of France, whereby the local priest goes on a rant about his the blacksmith's dead wife is in hell and has no chance to go to heaven. Blacksmith then goes into a rage and kills the priest, then heads off to catch up to his dad. He catches up with his dad and is quickly taught (2 minutes) how to fight. Then ends up fighting for his life and doing a great job of it. They travel on to Jerusalem and his father, before dying of wounds, hands over his lordship to his son. Now the new Lord continues on to Jerusalem, takes a ship across the sea and it sinks leaving only him and a horse alive. On his trip across the desert to reach the nearest city he encounters two locals who wish to take his horse, he kills one and allows the other to move on. He reaches Jerusalem and the king of Jerusalem takes an immediate affection to Bloom and gives him land. The story continues with internal problems with another lord not liking the peace in Jerusalem and wants to have a war, starts one which kills all knights except Bloom who wouldn't fight in it. Bloom is now the last ""knight"" left to hold off the army attacking Jerusalem. Bloom who knows nothing of war, creates some defences which are pretty corny. Apparently the army can only attack one side of the city but we have no idea why. Anyway the battle continues with Bloom surrendering giving up Jerusalem and guaranteeing free passage for everyone who fought to save Jerusalem. He returns to the french city that wanted him for the murder of the priest (they apparently forgot) and starts up his blacksmith practice again.Basically I think this movie was made for the simple fact of staging a battle during the crusades. You are not really introduced to any characters, the first characters that Bloom travels with are all killed halfway through the middle and there's about 30 seconds of film where you meet his new ""friends"". The movie just lacks in all areas, the story is convoluted and unbelievable, there is no character development so you can't even cheer for anyone and the bad guy isn't even bad. Just a total waste of money and talent which should have been avoided. Fits more as a bad ""made for TV movie"" then something to see in the theatres.",Kingdom of Heaven

The story is one of the best, it drags at times but keeps a great pace.This is my opinion, but it didn't have as much blood as I thought there would be. Sure a few be headings, but in all, not much.

579,ricmalic,See it for the visuals; Balian is too 21st century for a knight,7,1 April 2006,"I saw (and actually bought) this film because the visuals looked intriguing. I wasn't disappointed: the depiction of 12th century Europe and the Holy Land was stunning, as was the entire sequence relating to the siege of Jerusalem. These are among the best I've seen (for another view of Europe see The War Lord with Charlton Heston).Most of the characters in the film portray either real historic individuals or at least plausible fictional ones. The acting was good, with Liam Neeson's Godfrey and Ghassan Massoud's Saladin outstanding. Orlando Bloom was also good, though the character he played was not characteristic of a 12th century knight.I also enjoyed some of the other touches in the film: the mix of religion and avarice which really did characterize the time; and Baldwin's ""live and let live"" philosophy which was so important to the Kingdom of Jerusalem's survival--surrounded as it was by a resurgent Islam. Another very nice touch (and real by the way) was Bailian's knighting of all males capable of defending Jerusalem. In those days a knight could indeed make a knight.What weakened the film for me was the character of Balian. Its implausible to me that this historical member of the Jerusalem nobility would be portrayed as a blacksmith (and then returning to be one!) working on irrigation projects at his Ibelin fiefdom. This portrayal of a 21st century ""man of the people"" leader projected back to the 12th century may resonate with filmgoers, but did not seem accurate to an era when nobles did not come from the forge and were rather brought up and trained for military activity. Godfrey may have been a wonderful teacher, but I doubt he could have taught Balian THAT quickly. I found myself agreeing with the character who told Balian that he would not take military advice from a blacksmith--even though his actions did result in disaster for the kingdom. And where did an ex blacksmith achieve such strategic insight? Orlando Bloom's character is clearly a 21st century person wrapped in 12th century costume.Go see it for the visuals.",Kingdom of Heaven
580,hripka-2,Crusaders just didn't talk this way.,4,15 May 2005,"Plus: Very well done technically, amazing CG battle scenes, excellent shots of the fortress Kerak and of Jerusalem. Saladin, played by actor Ghassan Massoud was excellent, the best actor of the entire movie; Jeremy Irons was also very good, Liam Neeson next, and Orlando Bloom is very far down the list.Minus: A very secular movie, and VERY P.C. movie. I find it very hard to believe that people spoke/believed this way in 1184, when this movie takes place. (I know, I know, I was not there.) These are Crusaders, trying to defend Jerusalem from being won a SECOND time by the advancing Muslim armies. But the script/dialog is very anti-Christian in how the Christian side explains their motives. When you have Crusaders not knowing the difference between the Christian religion and the Muslim religion, then why in the world are they even there?? They are fighting for Jerusalem, which, quoting Saladin, is both 'nothing' and 'everything', yet they seem like it is just another fortress. This happens throughout the movie, and you start seeing a very strong anti-Christian bias by the filmmakers. The only people with any faith in their faith are the Muslims, so I suppose Muslim filmgoers will like it. All the Christians come off as very weak characters. King Baldwin, played by Edward Norton, is a possible exception. He is a noble character, but his disease is so horrific he is more to be pitied. The Christian priests are the worst, acting like scum: robbing from the dead, showing no compassion, and are fearful, surrendering hypocrites. The other Christian characters seem ranging from neutral to extremely cynical (more from the year 2005 than 1184), hard-bitten, secular and worldly. Only Balian shows any semblance of faith, and even he is shown to be very doubtful. His rallying speech to the defenders of Jerusalem was unlike anything a Crusader was likely to have said. Completely unbelievable!! This movie is no Gladiator. Gladiator, and even Troy, are both much more entertaining 'historical' films, with characters that you would root for.

581,Pac Man,"""Gladiator"" once more - and then, maybe not...",7,7 May 2005,"Just returned from the movie theater with a very mixed range of emotions and feelings about this movie.First - the good parts... Very entertaining action flick with nice fight-sequences and special effects, just like one would expect from action-expert Ridley Scott. Pretty decent actors and actresses, especially in the leading roles. Very nice visual effects - which we have become accustomed to from the last decade's epic action movies. And this just proofs that you can get very good VFX from other companies that WETA or ILM... No bad thoughts about them, but it is nice to see another (newcoming?) VFX house take an approach at such things.And it is also refreshing to see Jeremy Irons not playing a bad guy for once...Then - the not so good parts... If you have seen Ridley Scott's Gladiator, you've almost seen this movie too. A man takes on a crusade from his ""hometown"" to a scenery unfamiliar to him. He gets some close friends who helps him in the end...The cinematography in the fight sequences is pretty much the same in these two movies: Very fast, up-close and hand-held camera movements. So is also the use of blood-spattering - much off-camera slicing-and-dicing, but ""sprayed out"" enough for the viewer to get a little ""grossed-out"" feeling. Anyone remember a fight-sequence taking place in a small stone-grove in ""Conan the Barbarian"" from 1982? I thing this was the first movie to use this technique.To recap the last few lines: Pretty entertaining movie that has its moments. 7 out of 10 for the lack of originality compared to Gladiator.",Kingdom of Heaven

That's entertainment! I hope that the soundtrack will contain the eastern music that undulates throughout (although recently it seems the soundtracks one buys bear no resemblance to what one hears in a film) and adds such a particular flavor.Alas, however, approximately 30% of the dialog was inaudible over the background and music - dialog that was critical to understanding the story.

586,hayman42,Gladiator and Troy look a whole lot better now,2,4 May 2005,"A film about the crusades makes perfect sense right now, but this movie is just wastes the opportunity. There are loads of underdeveloped interesting ideas in this script, but instead time is spent on an incredibly out-of-his-league Orlando Bloom. The man is not a lead actor. Supporting actor, fine, but he cannot carry a movie. His character is in-explicitly gifted at fighting and strategy (he was a blacksmith - he shouldn't even have been able to read!) and has waaaaaay too much help. His character isn't nearly active enough. He's a dull protagonist.Add to that cartoonish villains, a dull love interest, over-edited and poorly shot fight scenes, an even worse shot love scene, and the early departure of the film's only two good performances to make this one yawn-inducing flick.

587,shaw_gb757,And peace be with you,10,2 August 2006,"About the philosophy of the story: Ridley Scott created an idealistic knight who runs an idealistic battle, where both Christians and Muslims are equal in all the senses. Saladin and King Baldwin, later Balian, respected each other in battle. Courage and nobility were more important than anything else. None of them were religious fanatics. It is true that Saladin sent his physicians to take care of the Christian King! Nowadays there is this lack of respect between the warlords, which make the whole humanity suffers of ignobility. Another idealistic picture is the City of Jerusalem. All the various groups in the City: Jews, Christians, Muslims, soldiers and citizens (the queen became a nurse, all the people who could carry arms became knights, free people) were sticking together against the common enemy. ""What is Jerusalem worth? Nothing. Everything!"" I mean this is it: all the people should understand that they are all humans; there must be no boundary, neither delimitations nor discriminations between them. Aftere seeing this movie I can imagine Ridley Scott directing another tragedy which was: The Fall of Constantinople! It sounds idealistic, but I wish that someday you can hear these lines again: (Saladin): Salam-al-akum. (Balian of Ibelin): And peace be with you.",Kingdom of Heaven

Can't blame him though, the script had no place for a 'hero'. The supporting caste has done a wonderful job.Some spectacular cinematography and the siege scene is truly breathtaking. But apart from that the film failed to move me, unlike Gladiator. The story manages you from not taking sides, there is no real villain, that's a first I think. One really doesn't understand the dilemma of the hero, he could have saved Jerusalem by marrying the woman he loved, he had anyway gone to bed with her, even while she was married. But when it comes to marrying her, after executing her useless husband, he feels guilty? Now that was the part that really seemed strange. Why would he do that?

589,e-tzimisces,One of my favourite movies,10,23 December 2006,"I was very excited to see this movie when it first came out, and even more excited when I found out it was about one of the most glossed over Crusades! NOBODY has made a movie about this Crusade because there is more dramatic appeal in the next Crusade, where Salah ad Din and Richard, Coeur de Lion battle it out. This Crusade is probably one of the most important as it lays the groundwork for the following Crusades. Despite the film's flaws and tight compression (rent the full 3 or 4 hour uncut version that was just released) Ridley Scott did a good job.The real story is very multi-faceted as the Crusades were not simply between Christian and Muslim, but also about Christian vs. Christian as Western Christianity (Rome/Avignon) and Eastern Orthodoxy (Constantinople) were fighting for supremacy amongst themselves and their competing dogmas. It's curious to note all Crusaders were from Western Europe and nearly none from the Byzantine Empire. Western Crusaders wreaked absolute havoc on Constantinople.Ridley portrays with astounding accuracy how Western Europe transplanted itself into the Levant and founded another feudal society in eastern clothes (Sybilla, Queen of Acre). Likewise, King Baldwin was a very astute military commander and humanist, who may have been great and better remembered had he lived longer.I wish Ridley had played up Salah ad Din's character more as he is equally as intriguing. Born to a poor Kurdish family near Bosrah (Iraq), he was notoriously ignored and by Arab Muslims until he proved himself an able commander, only to be reviled again later in his life before he died. Similarly, Ridley makes Sybilla out to be a suffering servant to her duty as Queen in marrying Guy de Luisignan. In truth, Sybilla begged her family to marry him whilst they all thought him low, crass and vulgar and refused the marriage several times until she kicked up enough of a fuss.If you have any interest in Byzantine, Middle Age or Near Eastern history I would encourage you to see the film and ignore the flaws for overall entertainment.

The final battle where Saladin lays siege to Jerusalem and eventually wins its surrender goes on for something like 20-30 minutes! I mean everybody enjoys a good battle but enough is enough!

Instead, Kingdom Of Heaven comes across as poor man's Alexander! We've seen many grand, epic battle scenes before in the LOTR trilogy, Troy etc. so what's so awe inspiring about seeing more of the same? If the spectacle isn't so thrilling anymore, maybe the acting can make up for it? Wrong! You just can't take Orlando Bloom seriously as an invincible warrior when he looks like he should be standing at a blackboard writing lines in detention! He's limited acting ability might get him through supporting roles but he simply doesn't possess the charisma or physical presence to carry an epic picture based on such an unbelievable character ascendancy. Since when does a horseshoe banging blacksmith wind up as a master battle tactician issuing orders to seasoned, battle hardened knights all within a matter of months?? Gladiator's plot may not be wholly plausible but with powerhouse Russ on board, any cracks the film might have had are instantly smoothed over. Even Alexander had Farrell - who is a far superior actor to Bloom. It raises the question how both Alexander and Kingdom Of Heaven might have turned out had Ridley snatched Farrell for Kingdom Of Heaven before he signed for Alexander? Despite having to put up with Farrell's off set partying and womanising, he would certainly have a better movie on his hands by employing a lead actor capable of making us believe his character can achieve the impossible.Kingdom Of Heaven is simply a cold, preachy, uninvolving picture which doesn't allow it's audience to enter the epic, emotional experience it's aiming for. This is especially disappointing when you consider the prowess of the supporting cast. The pick of which would be Ed Norton who despite adopting his best Marlon Brando (a-la-Godfather) rasping tone, still walked away with the performance of the film.It's disheartening to report this movie as a rare misfire from an otherwise exemplary director.

Christians and Muslims are portrayed differently. We see the hypocrisy of Christianity as portrayed by the Templars and it's golden rule followers as represented by the King, Tiberius and of course Baliol and his father Geoffrey. We do not see Muslims as central characters but the ones we do are wise and temperate. It would be an insult to otherwise: Salhadin is one of the great figures of history and Islam and should be treated as such. He is the one character from the film that everybody will have prior knowledge of. The usual criticisms are the performance of Orlando Bloom and the bizarre hippy Brendon Gleeson.

I understand the constraints of time when deciding on scenes to add or delete, but a lot of the set-ups to the final scenes were glossed over too quickly. When Bailian came to the Holy Land, how much time had elapsed before the ultimate siege of Jerusalem? It seemed like a week, yet his new-found property was irrigated and the hope was, I think, to denote the passage of time. Yet no scenes showed us why the other principles came to know and trust Balian.

I will say that one of the main problems comes down to the studio. And they are failing to understand what the movie was about. This is more of a thinking persons movie. Which the studios don't really like. This is only because they think that we average people don't wont to watch a movie which forces us to think.Anyway getting past that, I believe that KoH is great for many reasons: It's not bad side vs good side, both sides have the bad forces and both sides have the good forces. This is a time where Jerusalem has been living in peace for about 100 years.it's story telling on a grand scale, and it's works.The effects are top rate, and there are parts of the movie where you are totally unware of the effects in use.All I can say is that if you wont to watch what Ridley really wanted to release then watch the directors cut. Parts of the movie are more fleashed out so you can understand and feel for the characters a lot more.All in all this is a great movie, a million times better than what was released.

Also the protagonists display rather significant lapses of judgment and act in ways that undercut their potential stature. There's something not completely believable about some of the story's turning point character motivations: Balian kills a priest then feels the need for redemption!; Balian turns down being king and being married to the woman he loves (and look what bad things happen!); the Queen makes a villainous husband her King!.That being said I really liked Orlando Bloom in the lead role in which he does do heroic things ( he does seem a little small in physical stature, but I could overlook this ).

It has a plot that you can follow, it has a great music score and soundtrack, spectacular cinematography, costume design, special effects, and decent acting. Boring? Drama and dialog are, or should be, the essence of film-making. It is there that we learn about the characters, what they think, what they feel. This is done very well on both the Christian and Muslim sides of this drama. Cinema these days has become pure action, explosions, and special effects in general, which by the way this movie has plenty of. Nothing aside from that is acceptable to many viewers these days, which has made the art of cinema extremely shallow in terms of what viewers look to find in what they consider a 'good/great'movie. I beg to differ. This movie brings the ancient times of the Crusades to the forefront in vivid splendor, and again, all the elements I mentioned previously make that happen. I thank Ridley Scott for taking on the risk of wanting to make a film like this for these epic films help you appreciate cinema again, even if they are not to everyone's liking for no film will ever meet everyone's expectations.

Ridley Scott did a wonderful job of directing this masterpiece. Strong violence is an understatement; however, this was an accurate depiction of life in the Crusades in the Middle Eastern parts of Europe in 1187.Ghassan Massoud was very effective portraying the roll as King Saladin. Orlando Bloom did an excellent job as the leader of Knights and the protector of the City of Jerusalem. Both Massoud and Bloom displayed the effectiveness of leadership and a quality of humility.I was especially surprised how Scott brought this story to an end. An ending only on screen; yet one will walk away from this story and what the characters represented will forever be in your hearts and minds.",Kingdom of Heaven
604,two40,A beautifully realised world let down by a poor lead,6,18 November 2010,"With Kingdom of Heaven, Ridley Scott set out to make an epic movie. A grand tale with a simple message which he shows us etched into a beam on top of Balian the blacksmith's shop. It reads, ""What man is a man who does not make the world better?"" He goes on to show us this man, this perfect knight-to-be risen from a lowly blacksmith. The bastard son of a noble knight, the father of a stillborn son and a widow from a suicide.The loss of his wife and child shape Balian (Orlando Bloom). He has lost his all and is well on his way to losing faith in his God. He has little reason to stay in the little French town where he shapes iron. His only tie is his wish to be buried not 100 yards from where he was born. When his estranged father appears looking to make amends, Balian follows him back to Jerusalem with the promise of a new life and divine absolution.His father charges Balian a knight with his dying words before they reach Jerusalem. Strong words they are as well, full of righteousness and emotion. They speak to the theme of the film, being a good man and helping those in need, making the world a better place for all and being true to oneself. Balian seems to have big shoes to fill but we can sense the greatness in him and impatiently look forward to the grand adventure ahead.In the following act the film must disappointingly move away from the more interesting pilgrim's journey and enter the stale world of religious politics and the struggles for power between nobles who wage war to advance their personal cause. The film grows in scale but loosing the personal tale of Balian to a clichéd hero's rise did not make it more interesting. It loses its grounding in the reality Scott setup early on and very quickly becomes just another film designed for instant feel good gratification for the masses. A template tale you've all seen many times.You can just feel the climax of a large scale war building up even before the third act begins. The big speeches to rally the troops and the sacrifices everyone has to make for the greater good. The power plays by the evil nobles looking to capitalise on death and weakness. Yeah, you've seen this many times before and as much practice as Scott has, it fell really short this time. Part of the problem is in the direction of the film but I felt that most of it can be placed squarely on the shoulders of the lead.What the role of Balian required was a man. A strong charismatic leader who with mere presence inspires and whose booming voice can rally beaten men to rise and be counted as warriors. Instead, we have to watch a man boy with puppy eyes who easily elicits pity and has one expression to offer the camera, one of profound constipation. On the back of his Pirates of the Caribbean success, Bloom might have been a financially sound choice but in the long run his involvement delegates the film to the back of the shelf.To be fair, the dialogue is partly to blame. Speeches that are written to stand the hairs on the back of your neck instead make your butt clench in uncontrollable embarrassment. At the crucial moment, amid alien scenes of war when we most need to believe, a weak delivery pushes you further away from the world they're attempting to create. You suddenly feel deflated after you've invested 3 hours into this film and the pay off is a meek one. To walk away with that feeling is to walk away with the opinion that the film was very poor.But it's not. Despite some of its short comings it is a wonderful experience. Scott truly creates a violent yet breathtakingly beautiful middle age that's dark and alive with the tedium of daily life from peasant to king. The cinematography will take your breath away at times and should be familiar to those that have seen Gladiator or the recent Robin Hood in which the pair of Scott and cinematographer John Mathieson weave their illusions. Should that partnership have extended to Rusell Crowe, as it did in Gladiator and the less successful Robin Hood, Kingdom of Heaven would have at the least had a chance at lasting greatness with a more convincing leading man.The support cast are a bit hit and miss but it has to be said that Edward Norton puts in a stellar performance as the leprosy ridden King Baldwin. Covered from head to toe in white with a silver mask for a face, he is easily more regal than any man on screen. A beautiful and strong man in his early years, King Baldwin has been slowly forced into seclusion but maintains a strong persona for his people who expect nothing less. The pain he has carried since the disease started to consume his flesh, and his world, are fully realised by Edward Norton in the way he carries himself, in his muffled calculated speech and in his piercing eyes – the only part of him you can make out behind the somber silver mask that hides his disfigured face.With many redeeming qualities, Kingdom of Heaven is worth seeing if only once in a lifetime for the confident direction by Ridley Scott, and once more for the strikingly picturesque cinematography by John Mathieson.",Kingdom of Heaven

606,arranx,A misunderstood epic masterpiece from an outstanding director.,10,26 June 2010,"Kingdom Of Heaven is an amazing film indeed and like a lot of great things it was not fully understood at it's release so let me say this I AM REVIEWING THE DIRECTORS CUT NOT THE THEATRICAL. The directors cut is a marvel in epic film, raw characterisation is built at the start of the film when Balian, a blacksmith, tries to recover from the loss of his child and wife. Many factors are revealed in this opening act in France we learn of Balians life, his home, his family and we find out why he is such a good fighter as he states he went to war before. The film then progresses as Blians crusading father returns to see if his son will forgive him and go to the holy land. The film brings up questions of morals and religion as Balian enters the middle east and becomes an important baron with strong friends and dangerously unstable enemies.Now this is the ONLY film I have seen in my life that truly deserves 10 out of 10. The set pieces of late 1100s France, Italy and the middle East are breathtaking, as with any Ridley Scott film you feel as though you are with the characters every step of the way. Although the leads acting is not the best it is the be Bloom has done and it is above mediocre to a certain degree, but the gems of this film are Eva Green, Edward Norton, Marton Csokas and Ghassan Massoud. Green plays Sibylla a character forced to marry a bloodthirsty man whom he was forced upon, it is revealed that she has a son and it is in these vastly important scenes (which were sinfully cut from the theatrical) that Green shines. Norton plays the lepar king Baldwin who wants peace in the middle east for all religions, his performance is haunting yet gripping. Marton Csokas plays a viscous templar knight who cares more about land and power than god and is a character you love to hate. Saladin is played by Ghassan Massoud and he is executed perfectly as a civil yet ruthless character. The real strength in this film is the writing, directing, costume design and music. The writing, as expected from Monahan, is first class and makes a film about war have a heart with living characters. Scotts direction is flawless as usual and every scene looks fantastic. The costumes are astounding they all look incredibly realistic and look as though you could wage war in them. Harry Gregson Williams score is probably the best score I have ever heard it combines music from Europe and the middle east and captures the emotions of the film perfectly I could write an entire review on the music alone that is how good it is.Without an Oscar or bafta nomination for Kingdom Of Heaven it is not only one of the best films in recent history but one of the least understood. Kingdom of Heaven is a thrilling historical epic that has a beating heart of live characters don not miss it.",Kingdom of Heaven
607,parmanios,excellent film in many unseen ways,9,15 September 2005,"this film is one of the best medieval warfare films every made..it compares with benhur and other classics...for one reason it was not biased..it showcased Christians and Muslims for what they truly were and what they truly are...both are not fanatical religions well to my knowledge anyway...but the crusades was at times driven by the fundamentalist ideals of both sides..as the film showed both sides had its moderates and its extremists.at the beginning of the film it shows us King Baldwin which is a very moderate and peaceful king, and under him where many extremists and fundamentalists like Godfrey and so on...it is always the bad apples that make the whole batch rot with it.. the crusades should not have happened and but it did,, and i guess we did not learn from them this film is amazing in scenes of warfare, and the acting was better than i expected, because most war films rely heavily on special effects or jaw dropping battle scenes which this film had to sustain the film..the acting in this film was Oscar worthy indeed.this is a great film, and its one of those films that needs to be watched more then once to get the full grasp of it truly.the tension between religion and ideals escalates to digress that most Hollywood directors are afraid to show in film. but ridly scott succeeded big time with film and showed us the crusades for what they were truly were.",Kingdom of Heaven
608,karnage-1,Kingdom of Hooey,4,7 May 2005,"I'm a huge Ridley Scott fan, and I loved ""Gladiator,"" but ""Kingdom"" is a beautifully-produced bore. Historically, it's a mess; dramatically, it's a miss. Orlando Bloom does not have the charisma to hold our attention; most of the other actors (with the exceptions of the guy who played Saladin, and Liam Neeson) gnaw the scenery. The sets, locations, costumes and visual effects are superb - but the story is remarkably dull and many of the characters are one-dimensional. The tale of a humble blacksmith who rises to become Defender of Jerusalem has all the potential of a good Horatio Alger yarn - but not when the lead actor can't command the stage. Too bad.",Kingdom of Heaven
609,yekrats,Kingdom of Errant History,5,5 May 2005,"This movie from a technical standpoint was okay, but the history was terrible. The story, even though it supposedly takes place in the twelfth century...it is a compilation of history over five hundred years.The portrayal of the Templar Knights is slanderous and horribly insulting to people who have actually ever read a history book. I will not go into detail, but suffice it to say that the Knights Templar are shown to be slightly more evil than Satan.They also show the Hospitalers as being a great force in the Holy Land...a fact that is simply untrue. They were a very minor force during the era the film claims to represent.The movie also portrays the followers of Saladin as being Syrian, when in fact they were Seljuk Turks...after all the sacking of Constantinople (Istanbul) was Saladin's greatest victory...not Jerusalem.Ghassan Massoud was brilliant as Saladin...I would not be surprised to see an Oscar nomination for his work. The intense battle scenes were shot well and were made with the signature Ridley Scott look with his genius use of light and dark.The whole relationship between the Hospitalers, Templars and the Jerusalem Knights was the greatest piece of fantasy-fiction to hit the big screen in many years.Orlando Bloom was miscast as the hero of the movie, he would have been better off being cast as Guy de Lusignan and Marton Csokas as Balian. Crusaders were supposed to be tough, gritty and devout...not cute. Bloom came off as cute...even though make up tried to butch him up with that fake scar on his left cheek.Also how did a French Crusader get a name like Tiberias? Did Ridley Scott and William Monahan get some Ancient Rome mixed up with the Crusades or did they have some left over Gladiator script?",Kingdom of Heaven
610,bdiorio,beyond disappointing,1,10 October 2005,"As good a director as Ridley Scott is, it was obvious he was taking snippets of scenes from some of the greatest movies(including Gladiator)and was trying to cookie cut a blockbuster..Orlando Bloom was LOST..he started out as a blacksmith and became a farmer,engineer and warrior in a hop skip and a jump..having two armies meet head to head and change their mind about confronting each other was laughable..the next battle scene went from start to finish with no middle..when the ""final"" battle scene did start it was too late..the movie was a yawner..oh yeah,after the final battle Orlando tells the leader of the other army ""we will destroy Jerusalem if we have to stay here""..the other leader then states ""if you leave i will safe escort woman, children and your soldiers""..guess what Orlando say?..""OK,we are out of here"".",Kingdom of Heaven
611,pegasus1457,this is a step down for Ridley Scott,1,7 May 2005,"This film is so bad I walked out after an hour. The only real question is why I stayed so long. I guess it was because I hoped that some value would emerge from the gore and violence.This film is nominally about the Crusades. There are some good atmosphere scenes in the beginning of medieval France, but then the blood and gore starts. There is no redeeming plot. It is much worse than Gladiator, which at least had a plot.This screenplay would be an insult to an intelligent 11-year old.One of the reasons I chose to see the film was that I had heard that it insulted bot Christians and Muslims. I don't understand why. The only people who should be insulted are those who paid to see it.",Kingdom of Heaven
612,jb_gladiator,Kingdom of Heaven: a surprise for me: A perfect movie!!!,10,14 May 2005,"Before I went to the cinema to see Kingdom of Heaven I didn't had much hope that this movie would be a good movie, after I had seen all those very bad movies like Troy, King Arthur and Alexander. I also was afraid that Orlando Bloom would ruin the movie, because I think that he act very bad in his previous movies. And finally I also read a lot of negative reviews. But even with all these negative things I went with my family to the cinema to see it.And I enjoyed the movie a lot! It was a big surprise for me that it was so good, I expected it to be a little bit better than Troy and all those other bad movies, but I'd never expected this movie to be one of the best movies I've ever seen.Orlando Bloom acts better than ever! He has grown up and he acts much better and realistic, he really can carry this movie. Also the other actors are brilliant, like that leper king and Saladin, but it is really Orlando who carries this movie. In the beginning he says almost nothing, but he's very good there with his facial expressions. And also later when he talks a lot more, his speeches are very good and he uses the right arguments. He really says how I think about Christianity That bishop of Jerusalem was also casted good, just like the bad guys. Also the Muslim actors were casted very well and they were very respectful.The action and special effects were done very well, the siege of Jerusalem was even better and more spectacular and special to see than the siege of Minas Tirith in the Return of the King, but also the other fights were very well done and they showed well how awful war is. The battles really had a function and weren't just there to enjoy the public(like in King Arthur), but they made it more easy to understand the story. This is not a movie that's all about the action, the action has a supporting role here.This movie was historical very accurate, the costumes and armors and siege weapons were wonderful and also the story was historical very accurate (ofcourse some little mistakes and changes, but these changes influenced the movie positive, and it's a movie, a movie can't be 100% historical correct!). Also very nice to recognize Richard lionheart at the end! The soundtrack was very good. It supported the movie very good. At the right times it became heavier and faster and there were a lot of nice oriental melodies in it. The music fitted very well in this movie and supported your emotions.The most important about a movie is the story, and the story of this movie is very very very good. It shows very good how people thought about things like religion during the crusades and that there were also idiotic extremist Christian people at that time. A wonderful scene is also Ibelin, this is really ""the Kingdom of Heaven"", people living peacefully side by side and helping each other to improve things. The movie even hits you sometimes emotionally, because you learn to know the characters very well. The leper king Baldwin is together with Saladin the realistic good calm person who wants peace and sees that there are some idiots who are much too extremist Christians. But the most important of the story was the message of this movie, the last lines of text you saw at the end of the movie, very well done! I won't tell what the message is, you have to see it yourself. The ending of the movie is also very good.I recommend this movie to almost everyone, except extremist Christian people and conservative Christian USA people who say all the time ""God wants it"", because this movie has a lot of good argumented critic against those people. Now I also understand all those those negative reviews, because the writers of these reviews are probably these conservative Christian people who can't accept the truth. I myself, to give you more information about who I am, am not Christian at all, I'm also not Muslim, I don't have a religion, the only thing I believe in is that you always must do what you can and that you must always do what's right and always listen to your own hart and think very well instead of only listening to other people and that you must always be very calm and not extreme.This movie, just like Scott, deserve a lot of Oscars! I would give it an Oscar for best movie, best producer, best leading actor, best supporting actor, costumes, special effects, soundtrack and cinematography. But I sadly enough don't think that it will get these Oscars in conservative Christian Hollywood.This movie is in my list of best movies together with ""The Last Samurai"" and ""Gladiator"". I can't find any negative point about this movie at all. 10 out of 10.""If this is the Kingdom of Heaven, then let God do with it what he wants!""",Kingdom of Heaven
613,senioru,is this a comedy?,1,10 March 2019,"I believe this is a parody.

614,sc_nightcrawler,It's close to heaven.,7,6 May 2005,"Even though the background is Crusade, but this film is not about Crusade. It's only a background. Actually, it's about a man whose on journey in search of his Kingdom of Heaven, and he hopes to find it in Jerussalem. The main character is Balian (Orlando Bloom), a blacksmith who decides to go to Jerussalem, serves King Baldwin of England (Edward Norton) who occupies in Jerussalem, hoping for a mercy from God for himself and his late wife. As I said earlier, this film mainly tells bout Balian's search. Unfortunately, it doesn't give enough time to explore within Balian himself. It wants to show Balian's search, but everything comes so sudden. It comes just like that, as you snap your fingers. Also the relationships between Balian and everyone around him. The interactions is too little, too sudden, and too fast; so the impression is not too impressive. Other disappointment is the bad editing. With so many great actors involved in it, you'll hope for a great acting performances in it. And it's true. Liam Neeson, David Thewlis (Hospitaler), Edward Norton, Jeremy Irons (Tiberias), though they only appear a few minutes, did great. Other unpopular supporting cast such as Ghassan Massoud (Saladin) also did great. But can't say the same thing to Orlando Bloom. I was disappoint with his flat performances in Pirates of The Caribbean and Troy. In this movie, he's improved a lot, but it's still not enough to fully erase his flat expression and voice. Overall, it's a good movie if you want to entertain yourself. But it could have been better. Better characters' development, better interactions between the characters, better editing, better in everything. It's not heaven, but it's close to.",Kingdom of Heaven
615,kjfoehr,A very important film spoiled by too much blood and a poor title.,9,6 February 2006,"This could have been a truly great film and a box-office hit too, but it had three major flaws: First, the title was unappealing. ""Kingdom of Heaven"" does not have mass audience appeal. Only evangelical Christians would have had their curiosity piqued, and then the ""R"" rating would have turned them away. More on this later Second, it didn't have a clear target audience: the historically based story, which would normally appeal to adults more than teenagers, was compromised by all the blood spurting violence which turns off adults. But the extreme violence was not enough to prevent the hip-hop generation from being bored by the history and religion. Voila! You have a film that doesn't really appeal to any specific target audience.Third, the sound quality was poor at times and it inhibited the audience understanding of the story. Many of the actors had accents that are difficult to understand even when there is perfect enunciation and good sound quality; but in this case the enunciation was sometimes poor and the sound was not loud enough to compensate for it. This coupled with the unusual words, names, and titles used (e.g, Saracens or Balian of Ibelin) made understanding the dialog and following the story sometimes impossible. Thus, many typical action adventure moviegoers were undoubtedly clueless as to what it was really all about.The film is considered a flop at the box office, and I think this could easily have been avoided by giving the film a decent name! Who knows what ""Kingdom of Heaven"" means, and who cares? Obviously it refers to something religious, but mainstream action moviegoers aren't motivated to see a film about religion! Yes, ""The Passion of the Christ"" was a huge hit, but its success was due largely to all the controversy.""Kingdom of Heaven"" could have generated some controversy, thus increasing its publicity, but the producers apparently chose to avoid rather than cultivate that. A simple title change could have made a big difference. A title like ""Crusade"" would have been much more appealing and potentially controversial too due to its provocative association with current events. (Heck, they could have named it the First Crusade and then set the stage for seven more sequels  one for each of the Eight Crusades!) In my opinion, the film's relevance to the current ""clash of civilizations"" is what makes the movie interesting; and if its relevance to current events had been conveyed to people by means of a better title, then more people would have gone to see it.Even with its flaws, ""Kingdom of Heaven"" should have had a much wider audience because it depicts a sad but important chapter in our history. It showed how Christians in the Middle Ages were just as fanatical and cruel as we think radical Islamists are today! Those who think Christianity is ""better"" than other religions should learn about the history portrayed in this movie. The film could have been great and huge at the box-office too, but the producers / studio dropped the ball or were afraid to ruffle feathers, and they paid the price for their poor judgment and timidity.",Kingdom of Heaven
616,sebg02894,Ridley's done it again.,8,14 May 2005,"It doesn't quite have the power of Gladiator but I still think that Ridley's done a bang up job on this movie. As usual he picks you up quite quickly and dumps you down unceremoniously amongst the very different conditions of the 12th century, with all the dust, smells and subliminal fear of that period. There are good and bad guys on both sides, as I've come to expect from Ridley's projects, and once again, the relationships are set up to be the most important focus of the movie. It was a nice surprise to come across some of the less well known actors of whom I've been a fan for awhile: Marton Csokas as the slimy bad guy, Guy De Lusignan, husband to Sibilla, and Alexander Siddig as Nasir, the the aide to Salahuddin al-Ayubi. Not to mention David Thewlis as Hospitaller and Jon Finch as Jerusalem. The performances are superb, again on course with it being a Ridley Scott movie. My main worry had been Orlando Bloom. Could he hack it? I was not immediately convinced at the start, but by the time his character, Balian has to step up to the plate to take on the responsibility, yes, by George, Orlando was right there. He's going to do well so long as he makes the right decisions. The story does play a little fast and loose with the facts as known but then so did Gladiator. It's definitely worth a look.",Kingdom of Heaven
617,salty-17,The Reel Kingdom,6,18 May 2005,"I saw this film on Tuesday, 5/17, and was greatly disappointed. It is visually impressive but seriously flawed in character development and portrayals. Most of the characters were not deep enough to hold my interest. The major exception is Liam Neeson as the protagonist's father, but he is removed from the board early in the film. Orlando Bloom was probably not the best choice for the male lead, with his wooden acting and cardboard-thin charisma. There was also very little chemistry between the male and female leads.This film covers a wide scope and tries to deal with a number of issues. But I think it fails to capture the complexity of the political and personal intrigues that made the Crusades so controversial in their own times as well as in contemporary times. Running at only 145 minutes, this is no ""Lawrence of Arabia"" in length nor in impact.Director Ridley Scott backed away from the religious conflicts behind the series of invasions that we call the Crusades, to focus on individual motivations. But the wandering plot line and lackluster acting seriously weakens the impact of this film's internal dialogue.The first thirty minutes are tremendous. The entire middle is mediocre. And the last thirty minutes are laughable. Oh, Ridley... How disappointing. Don't be afraid to offend and be controversial in the search for cinematic and emotional truth. This film lacks fire, darkness, and anguish; and fails to personalize the tremendous suffering and tragedies that embody the hundreds of years of warfare in this part of the world.Orlando Bloom's Balian survives his journey through the Holy Land through unexplained battle prowess, sheer luck, and the gift of a repentant father. At the close, Bloom's character finds a separate peace without ever seeming to fight for it. This is not realistic, not entertaining, and definitely not believable.Grand epics are grand tragedies. Without weakness, strength means nothing. Both should be found in equal measures in a great hero, for greatness grows out of overcoming that which holds us back. And by this definition, the ""Kingdom of Heaven"" has no heroes.What a far cry from my original hopes...",Kingdom of Heaven

This movie is great from the artistic view, the great job of selecting the places, and the adequate balance of color/motion/feelings, enhance this movie.Ridley Scott bring much features of gladiator most of them excellent (the war scenes and the feeling of ocean of men fighting in one shot). The sound effects are greater, I really appreciate the siege sequence, the frightening sound of the rock falling in the walls. The history is not good, the redemption from an Old Man (Liam Nelson) which his life was in a philosophical and ethical way, the blacksmith which is in fact a Nobleman and fall in love with a queen which resign only for love, the crazy guy which only wants more power and lands, the general which dress his slave with his clothes.

True, all of the religion context kind of got on my nerves, but that was the time and Scott did an excellent job of incorporating it in the film. Bloom, one of my least favorite actors, was actually very good and proved himself to be better actor then I had expected. The action was amazing and had the viewer biting their nails during each of the fight sequences. All of the actors brought a certain something to their role which made me realize that the casting of this movie was perfect. The scenery was stunning and there were tons and tons of extras.

Ridley Scott portrayed this fact wonderfully in this film. The film also had the best line about God which I've heard for a long time. It was along the lines of ""If God doesn't understand, then there was no point having belief in him in the first place"" I have heard Orlando Bloom critized for not being an action hero, but I believe that was never the point of his character. Unlike Russell Crowe in Gladiator who was a fighter, this man is a thinker. Bloom portrays the journey from young angry man to understanding intelligent knight extremely well. He was ably supported by a wonderful cast, of whom I have to point out the wonderful Edward Norton who's face is never even seen! The cinematography is both beautiful and gruesome. Some amazing overhead shots of battlescenes and some beautiful scenery.I have heard this film compared to Alexander and agree that it completely blows it out of the water.

Orlando really takes the part and makes it his own it has his hero but i don't want the recognition touch on it and i think thats a really cool the way he does that.

622,graniitti,Very good sequel to El Cid,10,15 May 2005,"Kingdom of Heaven is a very good movie. I have now seen it twice. The first time I saw it I was afraid to expect anything but yet I had great hopes. I was not disappointed, but often felt how something was lacking. After the second viewing I am pretty sure an extended DVD version might fill the gaps. Especially slowly developing scenes that establish the emotional motivation and development of the main character, Balian of Ibelin, seen to be cut to minimum. But I hope the missing scenes are in the DVD. It is too early to say weather Orlando Bloom was good or great, but certainly he was not miscast. And we certainly need more screen time with Jouko Ahola.Ridley Scott has said that ever since he saw the masterful epic ""El Cid"" when he was a teenager, he has desired to make a film about knights. I presume he has been a great fan of the epics since his Gladiator is a remake of another 60's epic ""Fall of Roman Empire"" and in Gladiator he has made a better movie. He knew he could deliver a better version by adding what the original was lacking: a charismatic leading man and emotional tension.Yet with El Cid he must have had a whole different deal. There is no way one can make a better El Cid. It is the perfect epic: it had a perfect cast, a masterful score, compelling setting, sweeping shots and a script that is better than the legend. El Cid of the movie is the perfect knight who has no second thoughts about truth, right and wrong. It is the princes, kings, his wife, friends and enemies around Cid who show weakness, repents and grow, or fall. And with Charlton Heston you believe this larger than life knight is real, flesh and blood. I believe Ridley Scott chose to have a different kind of knight. A knight who is not larger than life and who chooses to live a humble life in obscurity rather than ride in to legend like his idol, El Cid. Here we have another interesting connection: When El Cid conquered the moorish city of Valencia in 1095 which inspired the pope Urban to call for crusade to free Jerusalem which happened 1097. Legendary El Cid was the ideal for a crusading knights like Balian. Balian finds that a true knight follows his conscience and not any ideal. Legendary epic film El Cid is the ideal of the crusading directors like Ridley Scott and he has managed an insightful remake of it's themes.KOH uses characters and biblical phrases to create a network of symbolism: ""I am what I am."" With blood in his hands Reynold de Chatillion recites the God of The Old Testament as he delivers punishment to the sinners. This man has no conscience  his existence is a mockery of the Almighty. ""I am Jerusalem!"" says the Leper king as he demands humility from Reynold de Chatillon. The character is carrying the sins of the whole crusading army to save them. The scenes with him all have certain sacrificial grandeur. Edward Norton uses his voice very well. The phrase is later repeated by Guy de Lusignan before making everyone suffer for his sins. First you think Csokas is miscast, but perhaps the character is intended to appear as a complete mockery of any honour and sacrifice.The muslims in the movie are nicely portrayed. Perhaps too nicely since in the end there is a lack of fear in the audience. Why are they fighting in Jerusalem if the muslims are such just and merciful people as Saladin and his deputy are portrayed? Certainly they could all go freely if they just asked. I believe scenes were cut that establish what a menacing threat to crusaders lives some muslims posed. Unfortunately these scenes are necessary to explaine the final battle. There are two meaningful debates between the muslims, Saladin and his deputies. First one claims that only Allah decides the outcomes of battles and Saladin has no right to make a truce. Saladin easily turns the argument around. The exchange of words is a classic debate. The other deputy argues that he followed Saladin's own example which Saladin can not argue against. Saladin shows that God's presumed will is not something you can base your decisions on or defend them later. Ghassan Massoud gives an excellent performance as Saladin. This man is a king, a man of calculation and discipline. Even as he privately shows empathy, he can not afford idealism and give mercy unless it is politically wise. A good man tied to the realities of world full of fools.",Kingdom of Heaven
623,nk-13,men at war again (ho hum),5,8 May 2005,"This movie looks great, has some enjoyable performances and seems very fair to all and sundry. Pity about the script. There is some measure of intelligence and poetry afoot in the film, but I was bored; Balian goes to Jerusalem, Balian fights for Jerusalem, Balian negotiates safe passage for the people of Jerusalem. But a lot of others die first. Super.The problem is Orlando Bloom. He is a non-entity. The film needs someone charismatic in the main role. I find it odd that a very modern looking man like Orlando, should be cast almost purely in costume/period films.Everyone else is a blast to watch - the main Templar Generals are nuts, the Muslim General and his lieutenant crackle with charisma, Jeremy Irons does his thing with that incomparable voice, David Thewlis is a shining light as the Hospitaler and Eva Green is quite soulful in a nothing role. Edward Norton does a very Brando-like turn and acts the pants off everyone from behind a mask.My favorite bit of the film is the Christian Bishop advising everybody under siege to ""Convert to Islam and repent afterwards"". Go and see it if you have an endless appetite for well executed battle scenes. If you want dramatic conflict and blood pumping speeches, rent out Gladiator, watch Russell Crowe and Joaqim Phoenix and learn how its done.",Kingdom of Heaven
624,la_walker,Terrible,3,11 May 2005,"This film is so over-rated its unreal! Here are just some of the bad points from the top of my head: 1. Orlando Bloom cannot act in this role. He has no presence on screen, his facial expressions never change and there is no grit in his voice.2. The plot/story is one of the worst ever made in film history. Yes, the camera technique and fancy graphics are actually quite good, but if you see past these the story never really flows or has any structure. It is unrealistic and cheap. It is funny how a untrained black smith suddenly becomes a knight to rule etc...3. To much copying off Lord of the Rings 2 and Gladiator.4. Some of the worst one-liners ever.5.

625,perrin99,Too much of a good thing,5,9 May 2005,"I watched Kingdom of Heaven last Sunday. It felt like watching several other movies at the same time. I felt cheated and frustrated, and that such an esteemed director like Ridley Scott would have followed the footsteps of Oliver Stone - admittedly less esteemed - in failing to create, on film, a satisfying historical experience.Scott of course made Gladiator, which I love and whether deservedly or not, swept the Oscars. The battle between the Romans and the Germanic tribe which lit up the first 15 minutes of Gladiator set the tone for the rest of the movie. It was no less the companion piece - situated about eighteen centuries back - to Saving Private Ryan's Omaha Beach struggle.Scott came up with about 5 minutes of that sort of superb, furious, bloody action in KOH, near the beginning of the film. The rest of the show plodded along, dragging the viewer with it as did Alexander and Troy.The failure is not Scott's alone. The medieval-fantasy war scene - of charging and crashing men and horses, of endless bombardment of arrows and catapults, of blood and words of courage - has perhaps been bled dry of directorial creativity.For me, the ""wow"" factor first came in Mel Gibson's Braveheart, and it was so new then that some critics said the movie was too violent. Not too violent for the Oscars, though. I had seen the Battle of Stirling so many times - the initial demoralisation of the Scots as they heard and then saw the vastly larger English army approach. ""Three hundred heavy horse"". The appearance of William Wallace - under six foot tall and without the ability to shoot balls of lightning from his arse, but with blue paint on his face - and his ability to rally his countrymen into battle. ""Would you be willing to trade all of that, for one chance, just one chance, to come back here, and tell your enemies, that you may take our lives, but you will never take our freedom?"" The words, but it wasn't just the words or the bravado. It was the situation. Mel Gibson got the mood and atmosphere right. What came after was fabulous - the whistle of the English arrows and the thunderous charge of the English heavy horse - but it would never have been effective without the previous setting.Russell Crowe growls well, in a soft, manly sort of way, but his speech to his Roman horsemen before the battle with the Germans in Gladiator never reached the same intensity. ""What you do in life echoes in eternity"" - nah. It smacked of arrogance. Viggo Mortensen, at the Black Gate into Mordor, faced the same odds as Wallace in Return of the King. He tried hard but he didn't even come close, both in voice and in credibility. William Wallace made me a Scot at Stirling, if only for a minute.It has come to a point when, in KOH, Ridley Scott decides that all Orlando Bloom had to say to rally his men is, ""Let them come, let them come!"". I was reminded of posturing WWE wrestlers (or some NBA players).And the tactics. In Braveheart, we see the ingenuity of generals - the Scots lure the English into a cavalry charge, break them at the last moment, and their own cavalry sweep into the English infantry from the left flank. Maximus was similarly a great tactician, leading a cavalry charge into the outmatched Germans, already committed in front, from the rear. The use of cavalry as a dramatic component in war scenes climaxes in ROTK - Theoden's arrival at Pelennor Fields outside Minas Tirith and his ability to hearken his weary Rohirrim into a great push into the side of Sauron's army has got to be the best battle sequence in the trilogy. ""Spears shall be shaken, shields shall be splintered"". (Actually the Extended Edition ruined the atmosphere by inserting Gandalf's encounter with the Witch King).And since then, what? The best fights in Troy were the single melees - which tells you that there is something badly wrong about the direction of the larger battles. This is a movie about a war between Greeks and Trojans. Of Alexander, the truly laughable scene was Alexander's individual charge on a horse towards a war elephant. Didn't Oliver Stone realise that the Rohirrim bested them in ROTK? In KOH? Jerusalem was no more than a rehash of Helm's Deep. Would someone not send a dwarf to fight at the side of Orlando Bloom already? I would have loved to see the Muslims slaughter the tired Crusaders. But no, Scott didn't give us the pleasure.It was great once. But no more. Either bring forth a director who is able to inject dynamism into battles in a new way. Or else, don't tread the same path again, let it be.",Kingdom of Heaven
626,sherazshabir,Controvesy alert?,8,12 May 2005,"Uh-oh, controvesy alert. Ridley Scott has made a new epic. Okay, nothing new there, but - deep breath - it deals with Christians vs Muslims and may paint both in a bad light! Attention Daily Mail readers! Frankly, I can't understand what all the fuss has been about, as to me the film is just your typical Hollywood epic.Orlando Bloom plays Balian, a humble blacksmith, who decides to follow his father Godfrey (Liam Neeson) to the Holy Land to try and build a better life after the death of his wife. However, following his father's demise, he gets caught up in a war between the Christians, defending Jerusalem, and the Muslims who want to take it over. He also manages to forge a relationship with Sibylla (Eva Green) and tries to prevent Guy de Lucian (Marton Csokas) from starting a war with the Muslims, led by Saladin (Ghassan Massoud), which the Christians will inevitably lose.Regarding the big issue of whether the film is anti-Christian, or anti-Muslim, I feel that both sides are compromised, which is how it should be. I don't think that Saladin is particularly monstrous and if anybody bases their opinions on what is in a Hollywood blockbuster, they need their head examined.The battle scenes are quite stunning, particularly the climatic siege of the Christian's castle. For once, the use of CGI is an advantage, as it enables Scott to create the type of epic visions that he excels in. However, some parts of the film are very flawed, particularly the characters, who seem particularly underwritten. Also, the conclusion feels rushed and low-key after the huge build up to the epic battle.The performances are a mixed bag, which they usually are when a film concentrates on effects so much. Orlando - oh dear. He seems to be turning Keanu-esquire with every performance and does not have enough personality, or toughness, to convey a knight who led a Christian army. Green, as the queen-turned-commoner Sibylla, is gorgeous, but her role is underdeveloped, as is Jeremy Irons (Tiberias), who appears to leave the stage halfway through. However, the worst performance is given by an unrecognisable Edward Norton, as the leper King Baldwin, who is one of the strangest creatures I have ever seen on film. On the plus side, Neeson is as good as ever in an extended cameo and David Thewlis (Hospitaler) is up to his usual high standards.Kingdom Of Heaven strives to be something more than your average popcorn movie, yet ultimately fails. However, for it's battle scenes alone, it is worth seeing.",Kingdom of Heaven
627,douglarsen50,Made up is not better than the real thing,6,8 May 2005,"What Ridley Scott and company made up for this one (a brief list):Balian of Ibelin is a bastard son of ""Godfrey"" of Ibelin, living in France until Daddy comes to fetch him ""home"" to the kingdom of Jerusalem. (Fact: Balian was the younger son of Balian the Old, and was a native of the kingdom of Jerusalem.)Gui De Lusignan was a warmonger. (Fact: Lusignan was an inept military putz, who had to be counseled in every move he ever made, and always did what the last man who talked to him advised.) Balian had a fling with the queen, Sibylla. (Fact: Balian inherited Nablus through marriage to the widow of king Amalric, Maria Comnena, a princess of the ruling house of the Byzantine empire.)Reynald De Chatillon was a Templar. (Fact: Reynald was a new-comer from Europe, who spent 17 years in a Saracen dungeon, then married the heiress of Moab. He was certainly ""in bed"" with the Templars though.)Balian stayed at Jerusalem while the army of the kingdom went out and died at Hattin. (Fact: Balian and Raymond of Tripoli - ""Tiberias"" in the movie - both fought at Hattin and broke out and escaped the field.)Queen Sibylla renounced her queen-ship and went off with Balian. (Fact: Sibylla united with king Gui after his release from captivity c. 2 years after Hattin, and died of disease in the crusader siege of Acre.)Balian was defending Jerusalem because of the helpless people inside of it. (Fact: Jerusalem was the central fortress of all the Holy Land; to lose it meant the loss of Christian control of the sacred and holy places.)Saladin attacked Jerusalem with 200K men from Damascus. (Fact: 200K men never formed an army in that part of the world at any time in history. Saladin's army was generously given 40K, and was not all present at Jerusalem anyway.)Saladin allowed all the people in Jerusalem to go free. (Fact: Ransoms were set, which Balian could not raise: Saladin himself forgave many ransoms, and even paid for some out of his own pocket. The idea that he would let the people go unpaid for is absurd: he had troops to pay, after all. Many people were taken into slavery. Many were pillaged on the road to the coast by Bedouin freebooters that Saladin had no control over. Most of the exiles died outside of Tyre anyway, because the new governor, Conrad of Monferrat - newly arrived in the Holy Land - would not allow them inside.)Muslims, Jews and Christians were living in peaceful coexistence before Gui, Reynald and company (Templars) ruined it all with their warmongering. (Fact: The entire area held by the Christians was in perpetual threat of being attacked, and the Christian ""peace"" was only a four-year truce: during which Saladin consolidated his grip on the lands surrounding the Christians by eliminating his last Muslim foes.)Saladin's sister was killed by Reynald De Chatillon. (Pure fiction to make sympathy for Saladin stronger with the movie audience.)Trivial question: how in the world did Balian get to return to France, where he had killed a priest, and take up residency in the very same village in his former profession as a common blacksmith? Are people that short of memory or what? The ending stinks. But I will watch the movie again just for the cool fights alone, especially the skirmish at the beginning.",Kingdom of Heaven
628,Hitsuzen,"Moving in places, but it's been done before, and it's been done better.",5,22 May 2005,"The mere mention of the name ""Ridley Scott"" immediately ignites a spark of interest in most moviegoers. He's best know for his epics, after all, and the general mood during the lead up to the release of Kingdom of Heaven reached palpable anticipation.""He made Gladiator... what could possibly go wrong?"" A few things, actually. But before we come to those, let's examine the good points.The narrative itself is very well done. The equal and fair treatment of the story between the sides of Saladin and Balian/Godfrey/Baldwin isn't a struggle between evil and good (respectively), but a war that was inevitable, due to the strong religious beliefs of both sides. The scenery is breathtaking, too, so when the plot slips for a moment, your eyes needn't miss out on anything, they'll still have something pretty to look at.The main point of criticism comes with Orlando Bloom's lacklustre portrayal of simple blacksmith, Balian. Personally, I don't think Bloom was ready to take on the role of a leading man. His facial features in each scene were stone cold, and his voice a monotone.And then there's the battle scene. I say scene, because there is only one, and it seems to last forever. Comparisons to the Lord of the Rings' Minas Tirith and Helm's Deep are fully justified... one just wonders whether directors are running out of creative ideas for battle sequences. After Peter Jackson's work, nothing seems to fully impress.All in all, Kingdom of Heaven isn't atrociously bad. Go and see it for the spectacle of the settings, the haunting music, and Ed Norton's (surprisingly uncredited) performance as Baldwin, the Lepper King, if nothing else.",Kingdom of Heaven
629,Rustyegan,Watch it more than once,9,9 October 2005,"This is an excellent movie (with a few flaws, which, I believe, will be repaired with release of Director's cut). It is important not to draw final conclusions about this film after first watching, it is necessary to watch it more then once. After first watching, I thought it is a boring movie, because I could not understand who is who, and what is happening. More times I watched the film, more I liked it. Study of historical context behind this story helped me understand relations in the movie better. The fact that I had to read about it means that this movie is shortened, from longer, complex story, which has historical background. Excellent cinematography and sound, strong supporting actors (all of them, I regret that a lot of them die so soon (Liam Neeson, Odo), or do not have more time in the movie (Hospitaler). I do not want to comment weak sides of the film (mainly that it seems that it has been shortened from longer version), because I wait to see Director's cut.A lot of people compare this movie to Gladiator. I think and recommend not to compare them so much, because they are different. Gladiator is more action oriented, with simpler story and fewer characters. KOH is much more complex story, motivation which drives main character (trying to find lost faith and meaning of life) is not so easy to understand as in Gladiator (revenge). They both are excellent movies, but they have substantial differences.",Kingdom of Heaven
630,solymr,R. Scott does it again...,9,5 May 2005,"... and shows how epic's should be made. The acting, the costumes, the story, the setting, the battles all excellent.In my review I will not debate over the historic accuracies because I Hollywood is not true to history in any way, shape or form.As I'm a great fan of the genre, I must admit that I was mostly disappointed with epic movies made since Gladiator (except LOTR and King Arthur), and was praying that R. Scott would do AGAIN what he did 5 years ago in The Gladiator. And he DOES. During the entire movie I had a felling he was showing O. Stone, W. Petersen and others how it is supposed to be done. The story is quite simple and old-fashioned: A Kinght(Neeson) comes home from the crusades and wants to meet his illegitimate son(O. Bloom), who is suffering the death of wife and child, and give him his love and land. The son agree's and goes to Jerusalem, starts proving himself, falls in love, becomes favorite among the people, then an enemy, and war.But of course, during the story, R. Scott shows much more, the greatness of religion and it's many flaws and misinterpretations. The director does not take sides and shows the ""enemy"" in a favorable light. He tries he's best not to discriminate any religion, but actually shows Katholicism in slightly worse light than the Muslim.The acting is superb. O. Bloom delivers a mind-blowing performance and succeeds there where C. Farrell failed,he is becoming a great actor and definitely he has matured since LOTR and PoTC. Eva Green, L. Neeson, J. Irons, D. Thewlis, are great as usual. And I was SHOCKED with E. Norton's role as the leper king. He was so GREAT I could not tell it was him at all, and he most definitely deserves an Oscar for his role.The Sets and costumes are spectacular, realistic and beautiful at the same time. The battles will leave you speechless, and mesmerized.There are only two problems in the movie: 1. I sensed that various scenes were shortened because of the length and you feel that something is missing, which I hope will be rectified in the DVD edition.2. The soundtrack is great, but you have a feeling that it is the same one from the Gladiator and Black Hawk Down and I was disappointed with it.All in all a great film...",Kingdom of Heaven

632,some_libertine,"Some parts heaven, some parts hell",6,16 May 2005,"IN one word this film is patchy. This film is held up by two things: its supporting cast, and its cinematography. Orlando Bloom is by no means a bad actor, but when you place him next to Liam Neeson, Jeremy irons, David Thewlis, Edward Norton and even those playing even smaller roles such as Kevin McKidd and Alexander Siddig, he just does not acquit himself well enough. Bloom does have moments of genuine acting talent, but not enough, his ability is not yet refined enough to carry a whole film. Stand out supports have to be David Thewlis as Hospitaller who serves to remind us of a more righteous kinda of Christianity, and Edward Norton who is just stellar as the leper King. His performance conveys so much emotion just through his voice, and we mourn his character even though we see so little of him. A real shame we had to see so little of Hospitaller as well, Thewlis was amazing as always. The cinematography is visually stunning, to me it seemed mostly about colour and scope, making the desert seem alive. Scott really did well to see both the enormity of the Crusade but balance it with some humanly detail.Other historians might balk at one who actually cares very little for historical inaccuracies. There are so many different interpretations of history, and I think some historians really can forget how easy it is to sit on the fence in a book, but in a film you have to choose the most suitable story for the screen, and if that means that whoops King Baldwin took a few steps instead of being carried and that evil King Guy lived a few years less than he should have done I can ignore it.

633,spammerhole,Not quite Gladiator,5,27 June 2005,"I had been looking forward to the historical Ridley Scott would choose to make after the spectacular 'Gladiator'. Perhaps comparing this latest offering with its Oscar winning predecessor leaves this movie with too much to live up to....This movie is bland and populated by one dimensional characters and cookie-cutter dialogue. The plot is rather unimaginative and the occasionally superb direction just can't hold this rickety house of cards together.Orlando Bloom makes me sorely miss Russel Crowe who carried Gladiator on his broad shoulders. His attempts to make an awe-inspiring, applause worthy pre-battle speech is hopeless, you wish they's gotten Vin Diesel to do it.(""I am Maximus and I shall have my vengeance"" still makes me want to cheer and whistle).The good guys (there are lots in this movie) seem to be picked right out of the UN assembly, mouthing long diatribes on peace, justice and religious tolerance (hello! we're on a Crusade remember?. The bad guys just plain act badly. Notwithstanding the tiresome machinations of the plot, Ridley gets to show off his epic making skills in more than a few bloody battle scenes.Visually though, the film is stunning. It manages to convey the poverty and desperation of medieval Europe well. Locations and periods are faithfully and believably recreated. The final battle feels good to watch, but seems too much like the siege of Isengard from Lord of the Rings. Discreetly hidden beheadings and gore spattering and gushing at random intervals almost convince us of the brutality of the battles showcased in this movie.Many of the inexplicably weird events in the movie ultimately end up supplying dialogue-fodder for the unfulfilling end of the movie. The movie is vapidly disappointing after the sheer grandeur of Gladiator. Leaving out a withered Bloom and more accurately portraying the bloody hatred and brutality of the Crusades would have been an acceptable patch job for this otherwise torrid tale.",Kingdom of Heaven

There is also a love story, as the young knight falls in love with a Hot princess (Eva Green). Great battle scenes.

And no, not because it starred Orlando Bloom. The beginning of the movie initially had me wondering, I mean, what was the significance of a man claiming his bastard son to continue his lineage? Then the action started and I was completely entranced.The action scenes are a wonder to behold - the German, fighting wildly with an arrow through his throat, and even Orlando gains a tough-man look. He was well-cast to play the role, I felt, because he has a 'noble' visage and in the eyes of the world is type-cast as the handsome hero, which I'm sure the producers played on. Liam Neeson also did a fabulous job as the gruff father who harbors a rough affection for the son he had never acknowledged. And I almost jumped up and down in happiness when Guy de Lusignan got his comeuppance ~ what was another good thing about the movie is that the blame was not placed upon the Saracens only, but included the corrupt Templars and Christians that inhabited Jerusalem. For me, the main 'nit' was Sibylla. I don't think her character was developed enough to warrant Balian falling in love with her, their relationship didn't have enough time to develop fully. Yeah. Other than that, a great watch - if you haven't seen it yet, go and watch it!. My mother, who has referred to Orlando as 'the dwarf' since LOTR, actually admitted he wasn't one after this movie.

Well I got to tell you if you think that you assumption is wrong. Kingdom of Heaven is a great movie and still has beautiful visuals from beginning to end. It takes place as you might already know during the third crusade of the holy city. The actors are great and the neutrality towards Islam is very accurate. Oh, and did I mention the movie is quite historically accurate? Unlike Scott's famous movie Gladiator, which was only based upon a true story, Kingdom of Heaver has pretty much the correct picture of how the crusades were. It has excellent combat scenes, though some combat appeared a bit blurry at times. the meaning of the movie is very good, as you will see when you watch. So yes I do recommend this movies to anybody.

The acting was good, the sets and plot believable, and politically charged enough to invoke interest from those who would not typically view such a film. With neither the Muslims nor Christians portrayed in extremely favorable lights, it instead put the emphasis on tolerance and unity. This is shown through Balians consistent desire for an utopian Jerusalem. The crusades is not looked on as the brightest period for the Christian believers, and having such a film only cements the fact that we all must learn to be more tolerant of others. This, more so than the romantic over view of the crusades, is the center of this film. The film has truly saved the genre. I believe this is an award winning film.",Kingdom of Heaven

Nah, I'll stick around. Oh, wait, never mind, I killed a guy. I'll go with you.""

But he saved the people. That's what's important.The second hour entailed a montage of clips, barely tied together and mainly terribly artificial feeling. Many times I felt so removed from the piece that I wondered whether they just had the cameras rolling until they found a shot that looked cool.Then, whoa, all of a sudden, big finish. We find out that causes are not important, religion is not important, all that is important is saving lives, no matter how many murders it takes to save those lives. All religions are equally stupid, not really, though, because Islam is a little less stupid, and what is best in life is living an ordinary life, never taking part in a cause larger than yourself.Taa-daa.Hooray for the ultimate tragedy: a man who commanded armies, who could inspire men to battle, who had power and used it to influence for good, condemns himself to a life of ease.I give it an emphatic thumbs-down, with the second thumb in the neutral position.",Kingdom of Heaven

I put it up there with the likes of Alexander, The Alamo, and Troy. Yes Troy, do not forget that that movie sucked big salty balls too. Not only was the movie way too long, but the acting was horrible too. I doubt that Orlando Bloom could act his way out of a nut sack. I am also pretty sure that he is gay too which sort of collides with the whole Christian Values thing that this movie attempts to make.

This is how much Ridley Scott has made an impression to the world of cinema. However, this film poorly showed us Scott's true ability in making a gainful and flourishing film. I believe he and the screenwriters employed more time and effort towards the special effects than he did on an actual storyline for Balien of Ibelin. The film centers around the Crusades of the 12th century. I will commend the costume designers for their realistic and compelling view at what the knights and Christians and Moslems would have worn. I also commend the battle scenes and the cogency of the castles, but as we know, that can't hold up for a great film.",Kingdom of Heaven

Mr. Ridley Scott pull's off another eye popping movie, with fantastic battle scenes I find myself rewinding them a lot and watching them over. There is true choreography going' down in the Battle Scenes. This movie is Beautiful to look at for it's scenery, the acting, the film look's like a classic piece of film work with great character's all around. The King of Jerusalem is ill and wears a Silver Mask. Liam Neeson display's another side of the coin type character than I've seen him before. He play's older and wise. A lot of the smaller part's are brought to great life by a few unknown's (AT LEAST TO ME) The Syrian ? Actor I think, who portrayed Sallahadin. That Guy was great! I felt a little at odd's with Orlando Bloom in the Bleedin' Lead. He was great in LOTR's I II &III. He was fine in Ned Kelly. He was a bit weak at times in KOH. But overall,...what a treat! Better than Ridley's own Gladiator. A Great Epic. I would have voted it Best Picture out of all the other's even Crash, which I thought was excellent. But back to KOH,...in the final battle Salahadin attack's Jerusalem with huge catapult's slinging Firey Ball's at the stone Walls of Jerusalem. Very well done all throughout. Mr. Ridley scores again, with this right up there with Alien, Bladerunner, and now Kingdom Of Heaven. I can't wait to get the uncut DVD. That Should Really Rock! Rock On!",Kingdom of Heaven

647,wargamerscott,A Politically Correct Whitewash!,3,13 October 2005,"I don't go to see too many movies in the theater because they are just not worth the $10. As a result, I am much more inclined to patiently await the release of the film on DVD and rent it at my convenience. It is for this reason that I have just gotten around to seeing Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven. Normally, I am a big fan of Mr. Scott, especially of his Gladiator movie, but I must say that his crusading epic has thoroughly missed the mark by proving to be little more that anti-Christian political correctness run amok.The movie's religious phobia becomes apparent quite early. Within the first five minutes, we are immediately confronted with a Catholic priest that steals a crucifix from a dead woman in the process of being buried (we later learn that this is the body of the wife of Orlando Bloom's protagonist, Balian)! This initial shocking scene proves to be the rule, and not the exception, for KoH's non-stop sermonizing against the evils of organized religion. From there, we are deluged with continuous imagery of Catholic noblemen and Crusaders, most notably the Templars and the Hospitallers, indulging in the worst aspects of human conduct, including avarice, war mongering, and senseless brutality. But what about simple 'stupidity', the favorite aspersion cast upon religious folk by the politically correct crowd? Well, not to leave any stone unturned, Mr. Scott provides us with the Bishop of Jerusalem, a man that neatly portrays every dim-witted Christian stereotype ever invented by anti-religious bigots. Not only is he stupid, but he is also a yellow coward. In one particularly interesting scene, the bishop declares that he would willingly abandon his faith, convert to Islam, and abandon his flock just to save his own skin! And this is just a superficial sampling of the anti-Christian tone set by the film!Needless to say, the real heroes of the film, from Bloom's Balian, to Jeremy Iron's Godfrey, are all characters who declare that organized religion is for fools, that the real kingdom of heaven is found in the non-denominational hearts of mankind. It is here that another flaw of the film becomes apparent---the ceaseless humanist sermonizing of the characters. Every line uttered by Bloom, Irons, et alia, is simply dripping with overwrought emotion, as if the dialogue was handed down by God to William Monahan, the scriptwriter. Of course, to anyone with a discerning ear, you quickly realize that all this pontificating amounts to zilch, it is nothing more than political correctness proffered as wisdom. At times it is so silly that it is almost laughable! Only in Hollywood could such dribble be taken seriously.The film's protagonist, Balian, is also a curious character to uphold as a virtuous hero. Shortly into the film, we watch as Balian, in a fit of anger, murder's the village priest by running him through with a sword. Not content with that act of violence, he then throws the dieing priest into his furnace where he watches him burn alive! Balian then flees the authorities and ultimately finds his way to the Holy Land where, shortly after being knighted by his dying father and charged with upholding a virtuous code of conduct, promptly has an affair with the wife of a rival knight! If this is Mr. Scott's idea of a hero, I shudder to think what his idea of a villain is---oh wait, a Christianthat's right.Surely, in an earnest effort to be fair, Mr. Scott portrays Islam with a similarly cynical brush, right? Sillyof course not. In fact, Muslims, as principally portrayed by Ghassan Massoud as Saladin (the only actor to give an excellent performance), the great battler of crusading Europe, are shown as everything that Christians are not.wise, tolerant, and merciful. Mr. Scott seems to have forgotten that the Crusades were a defensive reaction to the slashing, burning, and enslaving of Christians by Islamic armies---but such a admittance would run counter to KoH's endless demonizing of Christian Europe. Therefore, the film's indictment of religion is strictly one-sided. Of course, I do sort of understand this decision as, if Mr. Scott portrayed Islamic clerics with all the hurtful stereotyping he lavished upon Christian clerics, no doubt a fatwa with his name on it would be promulgated throughout the Islamic world. He couldn't have that, could he? Better to play it safe and bash his Western-Christian heritage in the spirit of religious tolerance.Unlike King Arthur, which I truly believe was made to deliberately besmirch the Roman Catholic Church, I do believe that Mr. Scott's intentions were pure. I watched him on many television shows promoting KoH as a film that urges religious tolerance in a post-9/11 world. I do believe that was his intention---and that is what is so sad about this film. Mr. Scott & Co. truly believes that this is a fair and balanced look at religion and the Crusades. In short, it is another example, in a long line of recent examples, of how Hollywood is out of touch with ""red state"" America. Who, but a Hollywood director, could consider a film that attacks the West and Christianity, while whitewashing Islamic aggression, as a balanced attempt at religious dialogue? Who, but Hollywood insiders, would even contemplate making such a film, releasing it in a nation that suffered over 3000 dead due to Islamic extremism, and expect to have a blockbuster on their hands???Kingdom of Heaven could have filled an important void in our shared cinematic library. The Crusades truly were a significant episode in world history, one that continues to influence the modern world. If Ridley Scott was less interested in ramming a politically correct message down the throats of his audience, and more interested in a serious history flick, in the line of Gettysburg or The Longest Day, Kingdom of Heaven could have been a classic. Alas, as it stands, it might as well have been an Al Jezera production.",Kingdom of Heaven

There was unnecessary gore that really had no place in some scenes. the storyline was fairly choppy. if you like gore and battle see the movie but other than that there are no amazing features. nothing really seemed to be won or lost in the end so the whole battle to me was a waste of lives which was bothersome.

Perhaps there was the implicit assumption that Balian's wife was having an affair with the priest and was overcome with guilt and hence committed suicide. But alas, there is nothing to indicate this.Next, Balian seeks forgiveness in Jerusalem. No mention of Jesus here. Just follow the heart and it will be OK.Well, on this path to forgiveness, somehow Balian becomes an expert swordsman (when his father had to teach him how to even hold a sword two scenes earlier) - huh? Seeking forgiveness, Balian kills a stranger (expert mounted swordsman) in the desert over a horse. Later gives the horse away. Hmmm.Seeking forgiveness, Balian commits adultery with another man's wife. Great way to get forgiven there.Seeking forgiveness, Balian chooses not to sacrifice few lives to save many, but later participates in the death of thousands, in a battle he could have prevented??

Scott brings one array of plausibilities to the screen for our enjoyment and consideration. So much politic, so much jockeying and volleying for power. So what else is new? The film is rich and dramatically realistic. It depicts fanaticism only too clearly. It reveals a gruesome time and the horrific choices which were possibly, and probably, made by those who lived it. Perhaps the shades-of-gray humanity of what might otherwise be ""black and white"" characters is the appeal. We will never know really what the times and the City were like...but we most certainly may be drawn in to one possibility through this kaleidescope of historically-based vignettes that bring the times to life and ties the characters together. Why not? It would be wonderful if those who watch it could learn from the rather overt lessons Mr. Scott lays out before us. It is good entertainment, rich artistry, but, if we allow it, a constructive lesson in what to do and not to do in the current history-in-the-making. My favorite scenes are those that depict the extension of mercy to the embattled characters of a volatile time.

He had the innocence and the physicality required but lacked in charisma and depth, which made the few weak spots in the script more obvious.

657,Archon919,Mediocre,5,8 May 2005,"The Kingdom of Heaven is the story of blacksmith who joins the Crusades in a quest for salvation. In the Holy Lands, he will find himself battling Saracens, evil crusaders and temptation. It is not a memorable plot, but then again, this is not a memorable film. Indeed, there are very few things one would remember after leaving the theatre: the siege of Jerusalem, Orlando Bloom and the repetitive moral overtones were the only things I could recollect.Granted, the scene of the siege is impressive. Perhaps not as grandiose as that on The Return of the King, but still decent. On the other hand, Orlando Bloom's performance can only be described as disappointing. In scene after scene, he fails to deliver any credible emotion, and that is most evident in his pre-battle speech, a badly- written and boringly-delivered monologue.What is more disappointing than Bloom's performance though is the naive moral message that underlies the whole film. People, we are led to believe, are either good or evil. Good people act well consistently, whereas evil people refrain from nothing horrible. While it is good to see the film that rejects the fallacy of religious fanaticism, this film tries to force upon us an equally simplistic (and equally dangerous) moral dogmatism.To sum up, the film appears to rely on a single battle scene and Orlando Bloom's physical attractiveness to hammer in a simplistic moral message. For this reason, it may be best suited to audiences below the age of 16. People with more refined viewing tastes may want to pass.",Kingdom of Heaven

At the risk of sounding repetitive i must say that SIR RIDLEY SCOTT is a genius and no man in the business of entertainment has ever inspired me so much since i have followed him. His brilliance and greatness OUTSHINES and OUTCLASSES everybody.'KINGDOM OF HEAVEN' a movie which is quite evidently made with a lot of passion and hard work. It is a thought provoking film on many different levels, but still it is unappreciated and has been called 'a flawed piece of art yet breathtakingly directed'. This is understandable after comparing the THEATRICAL version that was seen in the cinema and THE DIRECTOR'S CUT. While the former was rushed in the narrative and was about 2Hrs 20 mins (approx.) in running time, the latter adds 45 mins (approx.) to the film taking its running time over 3 Hrs. This version has better character development and has an all new subplot which is PIVOTAL in the context of the whole story. The DIRECTOR'S CUT simply blows you away with its new and powerful storyline. It is also said to be Ridley Scott's favourite version and should have been released in the first place to be viewed in the cinema.Like 'BLADE RUNNER', 'KINGDOM OF HEAVEN' is a victim of studio's financial interests meddling with Scott's Genius work and lack of interest by the general public towards a film which is probably too intelligent and in some ways philosophical in nature.All in all KINGDOM OF HEAVEN DIRECTOR'S CUT is close to flawless and one of my top favourites alongside other Ridley Scott movies.

The story seemed incomplete and lacking continuity. But when I watched the film a few more times on HBO I realized that I had missed a lot of what was being shown.and when I purchased the directors cut I realized that the movie viewing public was cheated by the forced editing for time done to KOH.The film is timely and very much agrees with my own thoughts about religion. The casting, especially Ghassan Massoud and Alexander Siddig, is terrific. In Massouds face you can see the weariness and pain that Saladin possibly felt in his life. I thought he was terrific and would have liked to have known more about Saladin in the film. It made me do research on the man and his time.I felt there was a surprising slant to the clergy of Jerusalem at the time and it too made me think of my own feelings on religion.To all that have not seen the Directors Cut....do yourself a big favor and see it. It crystallizes the loose ends that I found in the theatrical version and makes sense out of the missing pieces of the puzzle.I hope that Ridley Scott can make a sequel to this film. I would be interested to see if he can make an equally compelling and timely movie as he has with KOH. If more people can see this film with an open mind and heart the world might truly become a place of tolerance and acceptance so that we might all live in peace.The directors, writers, and actors comments during the film on the expanded edition prove another valuable source of information and insight that further enhance the enjoyment of this film.",Kingdom of Heaven

661,avatarianism,Disappointment,6,18 June 2006,"If this movie has one significant bad quality, it is the lack of a good lead. You have to give some credit to Bloom knowing this is his first major role in a popular film, but he is still too small of a talent to fit the mold of a primary character. After all, it would have been nice if his expression changed once in awhile. How is it a mere blacksmith can go from being engaged in a bloody fight with the bishop's men at arms, to being involved in a brutal shipwreck (in which only he survives), and finally, to being beseached by the KING OF JERUSALEM to succeed him and always possess the exact same expression upon his face? I especially loved the shipwreck part. He regains consciousness among a field of debris and corpses, and his face seems to say, ""Oh, bummer. I'll be on my way now."" He then immediately proceeds to saunter twenty feet from where he wakes to conveniently find a horse entrapped under a net or something of the sort. Swell.The fact that Bloom is constantly surrounded by well-defined characters only makes him look worse by contrast. To be quite honest, the characters in this movie are quite good - with exception to Bloom, whose 1-dimensional characteristics make him utterly boring. (Eva Green's character wasn't so great either.This last point is more of a nag than anything else:The whole attempt-to-inspire-speech that modern directors feel compelled to include in movies is too much. It's corny and cheesy. I think mainly of Bloom's little charade of dubbing everyone in the city a knight.

For me, this may in the Director's version this may be the best thing Ridley Scott has done.In some ways, this is like an old school Hollywood epic in that there is so much more story to it. I'm still not certain what I think of Orlando Bloom in the role. In some ways, I think he's perfect and in others, maybe not the best choice. But either way, given all the other characters, in particular Ghassan Massoud as Saladin, it doesn't really matter.

My guess is I will upgrade my grade from 7 to 9 (at the most). The reason it can only be a 9 is because of Orlando Bloom, sorry but he's to young/weak for this part, you do not get the same feeling about him as let's say Crowe in Gladiator, which I think is a fair comparison.If you haven't seen it yet.

The characters are allowed more breathing room, more history and more complexity.The history behind the film, aside from some tinkering with the characters Balian and Sibylla, is quite accurate. The crusaders literally destroyed themselves at the Battle of Hattin. Greed and hubris did them in. Marton Csokas as Guy de Luisignon fully embraces the attitude which eventually destroyed the crusader kingdom of Jerusalem. In the face of all reason, all attempts at building a peaceful kingdom, he looses the imp of destruction. Looking back, it appears an act of madness. But one does not need look so far to see acts of madness...The film was beautifully shot. Ridley Scott is a very painterly director.The actors were all wonderful. Liam Neeson can do no wrong (watch Kinsey). Eva Green had barely a moment in the theatrical release - she shows great depth and passion in the director's cut. Some have said that Edward Norton was a better actor behind a mast than Orlando Bloom was without, but this is not true. Norton does a good job with the lines he is given - and you have to admit, they are quite preachy lines for a young man - but they are speeches and his character is the most unformed in the film.And I strongly defend Orlando Bloom in this role. He does not chew the scenery, but he portrays a lost soul who finds a mission with a wonderful sensitivity and believability. It was obvious that he had a visceral understanding of Balian. A man who loses everything can make a choice - be better or be worse.Also loved David Thewlis as the quirky angel and Alexander Siddig as the thoughtful counselor.I showed this video to my older brother, who is not a movie goer.

667,fireandwater,Why Kingdom of Heaven is so much better than people want to believe.,10,15 February 2007,"First of all, Sir Ridley Scott is an amazing director with outstanding vision for what he wants and needs in a film. Wolfgang Peterson's laughable adaptation of the Iliad into Troy has nothing on even the worst of Ridley Scott-directed movies. First and foremost, people don't want to like Kingdom of Heaven because it deals with the rather touchy subject of Christians versus Muslims. No devout Christian would appreciate the portrayal of the Muslim culture and their leader Saladin in this film, despite its (at the time) near-accuracy. On the other hand, it is doubtful that a Muslim would enjoy this film for reasons beyond normal reckoning. A Jew or Atheist would probably not care very much about a film set in the Crusades. But, all that said, we must understand not only the stunningly choreographed battle sequences and visual effects, but we must admire the skill, dedication, and love which the writer invested in this project. True, this is a story to entertain above all else, but one would be surprised at the amount of historical truth infused with the fiction. Sadly, when watching a movie, one often forgets the crew behind it. every weapon, every banner, every set piece, was specially manufactured by large crew teams specifically for this project. That kind of intense love for a project has not been seen since Lord of the Rings. Speaking of which, how about the actors Martin Csokas and Orlando Bloom, both in LOTR, who star as Guy de Lusignan and Balian of Ibelin, respectively? One can only admire their passion for their work. Martin as Guy could not, absolutely could not have been cast more perfectly: he pulls off the ""guy we love to hate"" role in a similar way that Jason Isaacs does as Mr. Malfoy in the Harry Potter movies. As for Mr. Bloom, this film was his first starring role, and though he may not fit the Brad Pitt physique common to most action stars, his talent (sadly, often overlooked) more than makes up the balance, and we are able to accept this relatively young rising star as the reluctant hero-knight figure that resides in the imagination of every child and every actor worth their screen time. However, just because these two are the stars does not mean there are not other actors worthy of note(s): for example, Brendan Gleeson, who makes a magnificent Reynald de Chatillon, the evil villain who constantly provokes Saladin into attacking the Christians. David Thewlis, as the Hospitaler, the man who teaches Balian more about religion than the French village priests ever could have; and last mentioned but not least, Edward Norton makes a stunning and poignant appearance as King Baldwin IV, the Leper King. Between the Director, Writer, Actors, and Crew, they have created a film that not only is entertaining, but touches the heart and makes one consider history as something of interest, not merely a pile of rocks and mummies in the desert. It also, whether it means to or not, makes us ask spiritual questions of ourselves, and sometimes even question our actions, for as the Hospitaler said to Balian: I put no stock in religion. By the word religion I have seen the lunacies of fanatics of every denomination be called the ""Will of God."" Holiness is in right action, and courage on behalf of those who cannot defend themselves. What God desires is here (points to head) and here (points to heart) and by what you decide to do everyday, you will be a good man, or not (please note that this is not an exact quote, but as close a representation as can be gathered from memory, as i do not have the script or the TV screen in front of me right now.) In final conclusion, I give this film a 10/10 for reasons listed above, and I hope that, in time, others will see and appreciate this film not only for what it is (entertainment) but also for what it represents (Spiritual and personal growth through trial and suffering).",Kingdom of Heaven
668,nazim_79,Decent but misses 'ridley-scott' style,6,20 January 2007,"I saw this movie in India. Kingdom of Heaven starts with a bang(the 'action-packed' scene at the start) but fails to retain the 'commercial elements' throughout. The technical aspects of KOH were good but what was really shocking was the shabby screenplay. Please Mr. scott, re-edit this film with all the shots that you withheld and re-release it. One can easily make out that some of the shots must have been deliberately not included in the film. For example, i expected more battle scenes...when the guy's army faces off with saladin's army...at that precise moment i expected a classic battle scene at least for 30 secs in ridley scott style, but i was disappointed when it was cut short just to show the aftermath. ...and the major minus point of the movie was the main character balian...somebody else would have done it better, even a new face. When a movie shows cultural and religious diversity, it becomes important to do a little research on the religious and social aspects of the community portrayed in the film. The scene where they show muslims praying on the beach is a point in case. Oh please...they don't pray separately and that too on top of rocks!!. It was really amusing. Though all the CG-generated scenes were a treat to watch, the scene where they show jerusalem from a distance was superb. But this movie lacks coherence and character-development is non-existent.If only the director had done a critical analysis of the movie at least in the editing stage...this movie would have been like 'the Gladiator' in its presentation. History must be presented in a proper way, otherwise it is not worthwhile; anyone can go read it in the library.",Kingdom of Heaven
669,aami900210,Orlando Bloom as an English speaking Frenchman?,1,19 November 2007,"We had to see this film in school during a course in history (critizism towards sources with historical content) and, must I say, it was really hard to view this film from a historical POV when all you got to see was Orlando Bloom in the role of the perfect, pure and good Balian.The whole film just felt like a homage to Orlando Bloom and since he plays the role without any emotions at all I can't understand why. There are also way too many actions scenes which takes away any seriousness that the film could have actually had.Even though Orlando tries to steel as much of the limelight as possible, I must say that the thing that bothers me the most is that everybody talks English. That a Frenchman in the 12th century would be able to communicate without problems with both Arabs and other Europeans takes away all of the historical credibility, the same applies for the flying exploding hey balls.However, I must give credit to the writers for portraying Islam in such a fair way and making almost any other character but Balian complex and interesting. If the filmmakers had focused more on the relations between the Muslims/Arabs and the Christians/Europeans (not only in an armed way) this movie could have been something worth watching.",Kingdom of Heaven
670,guilamu,A really good war-movie and more !,9,6 May 2005,"What can we say about this film ? First very very good acting, Bloom is more believable than i thought he could be. (It's not R. Crow but why do the hero should always be 2 meters and 100 kg of muscles ?). Actions scenes are just nice, the end everyone knows is really original for this kind of movie.Special note for Jeremy Irons, always excellent and i must admit that i felt in love with the eye candy Eva Green :) At this point i should gave a 7/10 for this movie.The other thing i wanted you to pay attention to is the overall message of the movie : On one hand we can see that Clergymen are corrupted, bad and useless, ALL Religions are good only if you take your responsibility to make ""good things"" says Scott. On the other hand he tell us that life value is far more important than any religious conviction.Thanks Scott for this message in an America corroded by religious concerns in the higher level of the state...Definitively worth a 9/10 for this entertaining movie associated to a contemporary message everyone should meditate on.",Kingdom of Heaven
671,ayla5169,the best,10,22 February 2008,"Kingdom of Heaven is the best movie of all times, it's a pity that the Director's Cut wasn't released at movie theaters from the very beginning as it makes much more sense than the short version and therefore it's a greater movie.Ridley Scott showed us once more he is the Master. He knows how to create real worlds, so real that you can almost feel them. His movies are full of realism. The sky's the limit and with Kingdom of Heaven he reached the sky. No matter what people thinks. He nailed it! Everything is Oscar-deserving. Beginning with the cast. Sir R. Scott chose the perfect actors, their performance is impeccable, all of them. I totally disagree with those who say that Orlando Bloom could not ""fit in the character's shoes"", and I believe he demonstrates his enormous talent, playing such a ""heavy"" roll. Ghassan Massoud surprised me with his brilliant performance, as well as Alexander Siddig, a very talented actor, too. Jeremy Irons, Liam Neeson, Brendan Gleeson, Eva Green, Marton Csokas, Edward Norton. Well, what can I say? Ashtonishing.The wardrobe is also really impressive, specially Sibylla's wardrobe. And the music? The music is thrilling, touching, exciting, a real work of art.Kingdom of Heaven really deserved some Oscars. The first of course for Sir Ridley Scott. Not only I don't get tired of watching it, I can't stop watching it. Every time I play it I catch some new details from it as well as human values from the characters. It's a joy to enjoy. I never had a ""real"" favorite movie. Now Kingdom of Heaven is my movie.I deeply recommend people to see it. Of course the DIRECTOR'S CUT version.",Kingdom of Heaven
672,Sean_J_Edwards,Another good film from Ridley Scott,10,8 May 2005,"I have just seen kingdom of heaven and have to admit, it isn't as good as gladiator but is still miles better than Troy or King Arthur. My reasons for saying so are that this film has more weight to it, it is beautifully shot (as we have come to expect of Ridley Scott) and the plot manages to try and cover more angles than simply having an epic battle.I guess it was a bit harsh to expect Ridley Scott to produce a gladiator beater, but then again I believe people are looking down on this because they wanted more vengeful soldiers we can sympathise with like Maximus. This film is trying to hold itself as something different and I respect that.Orlando Bloom follows through nicely, I had my doubts over him being cast, but he managed to keep it down to earth and keep the audiences attention. He nicely conveys the character of a troubled man who has started questioning God. Needless to say Liam Neeson,Jeremy Irons,Ghassan Massoud and David Thewlis have nice key roles and give good performances. That can be said for a lot of the cast, we feel sympathetic for both sides, we get angry over both sides and realise how silly the crusades were. The knights Templar are seen as foolishly overconfident, this leads to tragedy, although I hated them I felt sympathetic to their tragic outcome.It may not be historically accurate but it sure does give you a good insight into the times, he has recreated a world you can admire for its aesthetic beauty. (The shots of siege towers and armies bearing flags are breathtaking).The film starts slow, has various doses of swordplay here and there and a final 30-40min siege which was very well done, never boring or overdone.Overall I am glad Ridley Scott went back to the epic in order to show those copycats how its done, it is overall a bleak film like gladiator, but not as violent and brutal . I highly recommend this film. If you forget gladiator for the duration then you'd find that this film has its own qualities.",Kingdom of Heaven
673,wildcopper,Don't miss the director cut long version on DVD,10,26 April 2008,"Most has been said in the previous reviews, so I will not say much more than personally, I have never gotten into Gladiator. I actually found it to be a quite bad movie. I like Blade Runner and Alien a lot though, and generally I'm quite a fan of Ridley Scott movies.What I wanted to add here is the following: You have NOT seen this movie if you haven't see the long director cut version. It adds so much that the comparison with the first theatrical release is impossible. The long version basically turns the movie from an average, entertaining summer knight movie into a masterpiece.To all those who have seen this movie only in its first ""short"" release, do yourself a favor, buy the extended DVD.

675,mtavares_92,Kingdom of Heaven: A Ridley Scott's Masterpiece,10,5 September 2008,"When I first saw this movie I was immediately surprised with its cast. So many great actors ! And one thing I do not understand is why many people discard Orlando Bloom as a guy that "" did not fit for the part "". Well I say that best actor for the movie doesn't exist. Orlando Bloom did an amazing acting on that movie. What would be best ? Vin Diesel ? heh no. Second of all, the soundtrack is..... simply beautiful. I have never heard such beautiful OST in my entire life. A mix of arabian sounds with chorus and other instruments fit perfectly with the film and are incredibly romantic and touching. This movie has flaws, yes. This movie has fictionalized some of the characters and actions, but what is Hollywood then ? People don't pay to see some boring history movie with exact facts and time, people pay to see a touching, romantic, action-oriented film with good actors and a great casting and visual effects. Sure, whatever. Balian did not had a love affair with Sibylla. Sure whatever, there are no historic records that Baldin IV had ever worn a mask. So what ? It's part of the Directors to "" fold "" the movie in order to make it "" better "" if you see what I mean. Of course they can't exaggerate or else it will become simply too absurd. But to simply distort some facts in order to make a perfect drama masterpiece is 100 % acceptable in my view. This movie should be 9/10. LovelyAnd by the way.. for the IMDb users that say that the Knights Templar don't exist anymore, did you happen to know that the Knights Templar have opened a prosecution case against the Holy Catholic Church for what happened 7 centuries ago ?? That's right, they still exist. I don't understand how can someone give 1/10 to this movie.. I just don't. Visual effects, soundtrack, casting, the oriented action. Even if you don't like the theme you got to give credit for those topics !!",Kingdom of Heaven
676,Monica_O,My favorite movie of the year!!,10,20 October 2005,"Well I have to say this movie totally surprised me, I went to watch it just 'cause it was an Orlando Bloom movie and I found a deep story, moving characters and a storyline that really inspired me. Not only the casting was really well made, to have Liam Neeson as Godfrey of Ibelin adds a deep to his character that is amazing specially if you think that he's just in the beginning of the movie.Jeremy Irons as Tiberias became a favorite of mine since he's not only a great character but a really human one, David Thewlis as the Hospitaler said some of my favorite lines in this movie and created a statement of the way things should be done in this Kingdom of Heaven. Orlando Bloom really surprised me since he managed to grow every second of the movie and portrayed himself as a real unwilling hero, I was also happy and taken aback by the casting of Edward Norton as King Baldwin IV since he managed to project strength and pain only with his voice and I really got to love his character. This story is not only astounding in the casting that also had Ghassan Massoud as Saladin and Alexander Siddig as Nasir that are totally new for me and where really inspired in their performances but it also shows a part of history that I never knew and that in this times is really important, peace, an armistice and respect between 2 great kingdoms, 2 great men and 2 religions. I think this movie is a must see, not only as a learning experience but as a entertainment since the action is a big ingredient of this story.I totally recommend and praise this story, Ridley Scott managed to create another beautiful, gorgeous and striking world in this movie with the help of remarkable writer William Monahan. Be well and take care.",Kingdom of Heaven
677,kenp_evans,"Exciting, well-told story!",10,9 April 2012,"It's all really all about the priorities. I believe that the real purpose of a movie should be to entertain, rather than to always be completely factual. I stand by this belief even with historically-based stories. That's just my priority. Kingdom of Heaven (2005) is a riveting action/adventure story, loosely based on the siege of Jerusalem after the second crusade. Is it 100% factual? No (some would say, not even close). Did I care? Not a bit. In fact, I was so enthralled by this movie that I felt compelled to research the true history of Balian, Saladin, and the siege of Jerusalem. And once I found out more about the story, I had to watch this movie again to compare. I love Kingdom of Heaven because the story is so riveting, and the characters so interesting that had to learn the true history. How many movies, especially historical movies, can claim this? Is this movie an accurate portrayal of history? No. Was it an exciting dramatization, an interesting, well-told story, and a completely entertaining movie? Absolutely.

The story is a joy to behold and is Orlando Blooms best film by a county mile.,Kingdom of Heaven
681,foxy_roxy,"Good movie - complex, but so were the times",9,2 August 2006,"I did not see this movie in the theaters and opted to watch when it came on cable. Big epics aren't usually my thing. I'm glad I opted to do it that way as I found myself replaying scenes to fully understand the nuances and implications - it's a complex movie.Aside from Orlando Bloom's character storyline, the central set of the movie is Jerusalem during the time of the crusades. A city of importance to people of many faiths - Christian, Jews, and Muslims - it is ruled by a wise king, Baldwin IV. He keeps control in the city by governing it as a city of faith and worship for all - all faiths intermingled. He keeps a firm hand on his regents (? his lords? his mgmt team for lack of a better phrase?) and disciplines them when they break his rules, which are intended to keep the peace. In doing so, he maintains the peace within the inhabitants of the city, as well as the respect of his/their enemies. He is respected by all and supported by the knights of the Christian crusades. He is wise and just. He is also a leper and is dying.The peace he has maintained throughout his reign comes into more and more chaos, as different factions jostle for power when he is gone - with some deliberately sponsoring or seeking opportunities to provoke war and attacks. This forms the main content of the movie.I have to tell you, this movie was really good. I mean, really good. The acting was good, but the depictions of the chaos and tenuousness of the times were well portrayed. The characters were a little hard to distinguish at times as they all tended to wear armour and crosses and all thought they were the good guys. One of the things that made this movie so good is that it recognized the blur - you have truly good characters doing things that they are not proud of or can be considered a sin, and major religions striving to act in their beliefs, when they are in conflict with each other.And the movie is BIG in its storyline. At one point in the movie a character made a reference to people starting in the crusades because of religion and then being discouraged realizing it was all about money. There are a lot of themes - but this only adds to the realism.Anyway, the movie got me interested in finding out more about the times and the real, non-fiction characters (ie Baldwin) that were fictionalized into the movie. I have to give a high rating to this movie for a captivating story and for making me interested in finding out more. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.",Kingdom of Heaven
682,bertieliu52,They are two different films,9,4 January 2014,"Watched the 190mins version. Truly great epic. God knows why they put the shorter version in theatre. The two versions are different films. Orlando Bloom plays Balian, a blacksmith who later was summoned to Jerusalem with his father. It was weird in the shorter version that why such a character could play a big role in the 12th century Jerusalem, just because that he was a lord's bastard son? Far from that. He's a talented engineering who's capable of building weapons, and as well a believer of true faith. Sadly, you're not gonna see this part in cinema. For those who claim that Bloom is not quite an actor, pls watch the long version. However, in either version, Edward Norton shines as the same.

Sure, at three hours and 10 minutes, this version is nearly 50 mins longer than what ended up in multiplexes, but that missing time completes what is easily one of the best historical epics of Hollywood history.It's really a shame that most people have assessed & rated the film by its weaker version.Its rating should be at least 8.5 or around that.Orlando's performance was one of his best.I think he is decent enough, as well as Liam Neeson, Edward Norton,Jeremy Irons,Alexander Siddig,Eva Green and Ghassan Massoud.They all acted wonderfully.Cinematography by John Mathieson was beautiful.I know, there are some bad points in the movie like all other movie have.May be the dialogues are weak in some points.'Gladiator' was a great movie.But in my opinion,'Kingdom of Heaven' is better than 'Gladiator' because of its subject matter.Ridley Scott once again proved how good he is.

684,kira-29,Double the Pleasure for Fans of Orlando Bloom & Alexander Siddig,7,10 May 2005,"After 18 months of waiting, I got to see KOH with a group of fans at a private screening on Friday morning. The critics just aren't getting it. But we LOVED it. It's not LOTR caliber, but it is pretty darn good. Alexander Siddig blew me away. His part is larger than I expected and integral to the film. He does a lot with Orlando Bloom which meant double the pleasure for me, and their relationship is one of the most well-developed in the film. Siddig and Ghassan Massoud have an interesting relationship as well, one that I hope we see more of in the DVD version. The mixture of humor, compassion, strength and dignity that Siddig brought to the role of Nasir (or Imad, depending on who you ask) has me teetering on the edge of going all fangirly on him.I think a lot of what the critics are calling ""boring"" or ""dispassionate"" is a result of Orlando's acting style - a lot of it is through his eyes and is very subtle. Those of us that are, ahem, attuned to every facial twitch, read him like a book. The voice could have been better modulated, but considering he's supposed to be in a state of ""nihilistic disillusionment"" when the film begins, a monotone is a valid way to play the character. The heavy cuts they made to bring it from 3 hours 40 minutes to 2 hours 30 minutes is to blame for a lot of what the critics find wrong with the film as a whole and Orlando's work in particular.Anyway, I liked it. I've seen it twice so far and will probably see it at least one more time in the theater.",Kingdom of Heaven
685,argent_tejsla,Watch this movie for Edward Norton.,6,8 May 2005,"I count myself as among those who wring their hands and thinking of how much more better a movie this would have been had they not cast Orlando Bloom. If they had wanted to appeal to the same demographic but find an actor with more gravitas, then they would have been better off with Heath Ledger. If they wanted to see Everyman heroics well then they could have done better with a less teeny-bopper actor.(SPOILER) I watched this movie already expecting to be disappointed and that's not such a bad thing. I would then (usually) be pleasantly surprised that Bloom's performance would be better than I expected. But what did surprise me was the careful, understated turn of Edward Norton playing Baldwin IV. Although he spends most of the movie covered by a mask and finally concealed by a grotesque facial prosthetic, I found Norton's performance indelible, largely because he speaks with quiet intensity, radiating authority even as his courtiers spit teeth and chew scenery.Though some may argue that Norton would stand out precisely because he wears a mask, he makes a feat of NOT become a prop and sinking into the luscious art direction. His penultimate scenes - where he faces Saladin to arrange a truce - bring a healthy dose of authentic humanism that was badly needed in this movie: It's clear that Saladin will never make the mistake of underestimating his faltering opponent, but he can't help but feel pity and be horrified by him - and wonderfully Norton makes this reaction plausible.Some time later, when Baldwin IV chastises an errant knight - beating him with a switch and proclaiming, ""I am Jerusalem!"" - it was all the more powerful because he had been provoked beyond all endurance (not to mention, vaguely reminiscent of those images of warrior angels trodding devils underfoot). When King Baldwin finally stumbles and exits on a stretcher, he brings with him my best memories of this film.",Kingdom of Heaven

The images were not prettied, but dirty and filled with the horrors that are war. The messages of the importance of spirituality, duty and honor over the organized rules of religion are as relevant now as they were then.The performances were a bit uneven. Orlando Bloom is carried along nicely and does a satisfactory job as Balian, but his acting has been better. Liam Neeson, Jeremy Irons, Edward Norton... these men gave outstanding performances. Particularly Edward Norton. He had me watching in awe. His character, the King, is forced by leprosy to cover his face with a silver mask, his entire body wrapped in cloth. All Norton has to work with are his eyes, his voice and the body movements of a frail and dying young man. Performances like his are sadly few and far between and pushed this film to a whole new level.Once again it is the supporting cast that has made the difference between a good movie and a great movie.",Kingdom of Heaven
687,hemnao,"Great as fiction, only half the history",7,9 March 2006,"I really enjoyed this movie -- once I realized I was watching yet another political statement from the film industry. Suspend any trust in historical accuracy and take it for what it is -- a great, fictitious story and spectacle based very loosely on historical events and characters -- and you'll enjoy it too.Of course, the Christians are generally the bad guys and the Muslims generally the good guys. Monahan and Scott work hard to confess the sins of Christian atrocities during the Christian Crusades. Historically, this is politically correct propaganda at its most laughable; as a movie, a work of fiction, it's dazzling. Great story, superb cinematography, decent acting, etc. All in all, it's a fully entertaining yarn.The story only includes the Christian Crusades, which began four and a half centuries after Muslims first conquered Jerusalem -- the first Muslim Crusade against Jerusalem in 638 AD by the Muslim Caliph Omar, when all Christians in Jerusalem were slaughtered. Any historian knows that the Christian Crusades in 1099 were partly a response to Christian pilgrims being murdered on the way to Jerusalem, and partly a response to retake Jerusalem from the Muslims.This wouldn't be so troublesome but for the fact that the film (at least on DVD) goes out of its way to claim historical accuracy. A few ""documentaries"" with historians are included on the DVD -- all telling how brutal and wrong and greedy the Christian crusaders were, which is indeed true. But that is only half the story. Not a word about the first Muslim Crusade of Jerusalem in 638. Imagine a movie about ""America"" that begins in 1865.I'll give Scott and Monahan the benefit of the doubt that the story is accurate from 1099 onwards -- but, again, that is only half the story. In this film, Christians are the bad guys and Muslims are the wiser, peace-loving victims. No historical background or context to the Christian crusades is offered -- not in the movie, nor in the so-called ""documentatries"" on the DVD.If you liked Braveheart and Gladiator, and have no interest in historical accuracy, then you'll like this film for what it is -- ""historical fiction"" or a fictitious tale based loosely on historical events. Saving Private Ryan was such a film.If, however, you prefer seeing history come alive on the big screen, like Band of Brothers, which was very true to the actual people, events and places in its story, then this film may trouble you, in spite of its great storyline and entertainment value. It's probably not for you.Take it for what it is -- a work of fiction based on selected historical events.

689,SirDennis_C,K o H director's cut even better,10,27 May 2006,"The directors cut released earlier this week on DVD has significant plot changes as well as deepening the characters a bit more. Honestly I could have sat through a 5th hour. Anyway don't wanna say too much but It is better... they introduce Balian as a siege engineer which explains why he was so capable at defending Jerusalem. It's little bits of info like this that solve some of the problems with the first release cut. Also Sibila's line save the people from what I have done now makes sense because Guy was not automatically king when her brother died. He became king only after something Sibila did. Also kingship was never offered to Balian only control of the armies... like I said significant plot changes. But the film's message of peace is as strong as ever. This will be seen as a great film when people look back... too bad the market is so fickle. Kudos for the extras including a clearer discussion of the rationale for the making the movie (important and timely political film here) as well as a discussion of the reaction to the original release. Great movie on so many levels one everyone, Christian, Muslim, Jew (or other) should watch. Favourite lines: Bishop: Convert to Islam repent later. Balian: You've taught me a lot about religion. Balian behaved more as a Christian should than most of the religious types he was surrounded by. So disappointed it got panned... people really need to see this new cut.",Kingdom of Heaven

I'm a Muslim and have been concerned for years from the very poor image we have been portrayed in the Hollywood's cinema, and i swear that this film is the only and best one that said whom we really are. believe me, if you put Bush's war on Iraq and the war between Arabs and Israelis VS the film,you will find that their is no diff. the film is reminding them of what was called before, ethics of war. now, dramatically... how did it go? so poor, which made me feel so astonished, The main weakness was in Blooms character, we do not believe in him as viewers at any time of the film, their are no flashbacks on hi previous life that he has asked forgiveness for, we don't feel his sorrow and mourning for his wife and child whom he lost before the movie's events, simply we do not feel the man. having Arab actors to act Arab roles is a genius casting that i applaud them for it, but why when they had conversations with each other it was in English!! why?!! i really cant understand, specially that it was our opportunity at last to hear someone talking TRUE Arabic on screen for once:) it is a political movie, or maybe not you judge it, but it is a rightful and full of justice movie to Arabs and Muslims like i have never seen before, but with a very poor scenario. enjoy!!!",Kingdom of Heaven

Otherwise, I thought it was a great film. The action sequences were very realistic, and, more importantly, it didn't just glorify the Christianized view of the Crusades, which we so often get from Robin Hood tales of Good King Richard the LionHeart. Instead, it portrayed how people's greed and intolerance affected everything. I find it incredibly amusing that in the U.S. the film isn't doing so well (perhaps something to do with the fact that Bush spouts off the word 'Crusade' when talking about the War on Terror? Negative connotation = unacceptable), while overseas it's doing splendidly. I'm glad that the film was able to portray events so accurately, instead of just catering to what most people want their history to be like.",Kingdom of Heaven

I'm sure there's many more, especially for people that actually know history.**** SPOILERS ****Senseless killing of a priest by Balian Afterwards decision to go to jerusalem to find forgiveness Stupid fight against own people where his father gets lethally wounded Transfer to middle east by ship takes 60 seconds. High waves, ship turns. Next scene, Balian totally fine next to a shipwreck on the coast Senseless fight in dessert over the horse Balians father dies, Balian is now Baron of Ibelin. He's now shown for great length as a leader close to the people. Cooooorny. Guy de Lusignan's wife suddenly showing up in Ibelin for no apparent reason Said wife is totally dull and she's supposed to be the female lead role. IMO she didn't bring anything at all to the movie. Balian going to bed with no hesitation (after he lost wife and kid not too long ago) with Guy's wife. About 30 Christians want to fight against a huge army of the muslims in the first clash. ridiculous. of course they get smashed. Balian is offered to get Guy's wife. Guy will be killed since they know he'll start a war if he becomes king. Now suddenly Balian plays the noble knight and doesn't accept. And this after killing a priest and already sleeping with Guy's wife. What a schmock. Guy leading the army into the desert without enough water. The soldiers fall of their horses before even reaching the Muslim army. I mean, how stupid can one be?? And Balian, former blacksmith now knowledgeable leader(...), even warned Guy about this. This battle isn't even shown. Instead a ugly cut to the aftermath.Now the final battle is coming up. From here on it's halfway acceptable. Although i haven't got a clue where Balian got all his wisdom about battles from. Probably they cut that part out. Throughout the movie i felt disconnected. Disconnected from the plot and the people.

693,nuxvomica-1,"Outstanding historical representation, an almost perfect movie.",9,10 June 2005,"I have finally forgiven Ridley Scott for Gladiator! He corrected what were (IMHO) several errors in making Gladiator, and while I felt I had to watch the movie around Orlando Bloom (ie watch everything else but), I enjoyed it enormously in spite of this.It was made with a lot more regard to historical accuracy (constraints of the medium, and accuracy of history itself notwithstanding), and he managed to squeeze in many of the highlights of the Crusades (I nearly wet myself when I saw they were portraying the battle at the Horns of Hattin!).The protagonist did not dominate the film (as he did in Gladiator), but was nicely underplayed (Blooms best contribution to the movie), but the events did. While I found the character portrayals didn't always gel with my own opinions of them (The Templars especially, but it's all just conjecture and opinion), no one was actually portrayed grossly inaccurately, even when that might offend modern day (mostly Christian) sensibilities. I especially enjoyed King Baldwin, a fantastic character, beautifully portrayed and balancing the tragedy of his condition and the nobility of his character, without becoming overly sentimental. I didn't think we needed to see his face post-mortem, (the imagination always being more horrific than the reality), but it didn't really spoil anything.Supporting cast was absolutely outstanding, with special note to David Thewlis (the Hospitaller), an actor I've barely noticed before. Neesom, Irons and many others gave their usual sterling performances, contributing enormously to my overall enjoyment.Technically, the effects and camera-work were far superior to those of Gladiator (sorry to keep comparing, but I really was disappointed in that movie). The panoramic shots of the army were as good as I've ever seen and while you could possibly guess how some of the close ups of the army had been done (lots of large pennants and flags in the front rank), you really has to look hard and it didn't detract from the effect. I especially admired a sequence in the forest battle scene, where the Hospitaller rides down an archer, having cunningly concealed himself by riding slung down one side of his horse. The whole sequence was about 4-5 shots in no more than a few seconds, but so perfectly communicated what each man was doing and thinking (rather than the unintelligible frenzy of action one normally finds in close up fight scenes these days).While especially exciting for me as someone with an interest in the Crusades, I think this film is an outstanding historical epic in it's own right, standing head and shoulders above the recent shower of ""historical"" movies. While impossible to give any period of history a just treatment in the movie format, I think that Scott has done as fine a job as can be done, and only minor gripes about the casting of Balian and some of the dialogue would stop me giving this a 10.Seeing films like this makes me wonder what kind of a film could be made, if freed from the commercial imperative of catering to the widest possible audience (just a fantasy I know, but.......). I'll be going to see this again very soon.PS: Anyone else wonder why on earth Balian was given the line ""losing my religion"", when the entire Western world was going to instantly hear the REM track in their heads?!?!",Kingdom of Heaven

Orlando Bloom fits well into the part of Balian, the hero, but my favorite was Jeremy Irons as the brooding Tiberius.

The action was just really slow. I gave it the benefit of the doubt for the first 20 minutes. Then I said 'well I'll give it a little longer, it might get better'. THEN I was like 'PLEASE let this get better'. Then the sex scene. Was that really necessary? Nothing came of it (so I've been told), so what was the point?

The film is improbable, Orlando Bloom is no Russel Crowe and to be honest the plot lacks the connection with the lead actor. Bloom lacks the charisma and physique to be a believable hero of the Crusades - looking more skinny young boy than fighting hero. This is not the only improbable part of the story, when arriving at his home in the desert - a lack of water is destroying it - he makes them start digging and finds water, no one had thought about doing this, ridiculous.

I do not want to give anything away so my comment will be somewhat brief. Now, I do not care what other people may think, I thought it was very well done. After I saw the movie for the 1st time I decided to do a little research, and the results were amazing! I believe that Scott has done his research as fully as possible for this movie. I loved the fact that Scott treated both sides fairly showing that there are always good and bad on both sides. Scott follows a historically unbiased view of the period during the Crusades, which I believe that the movie takes place sometime between the 2nd and 3rd Crusade. The actors were all brilliant! Bloom was especially amazing. Liam Neeson is a spectacular actor and has shown his brilliant skills once more in this film. I was surprised at Ed Norton's skills as well, he was also wonderful. Eva Green's role was especially good as well. I want to congratulate all of those who worked on this film for it was truly a treasure to see.

I know a lot of us were underwhelmed and were expecting more from Ridley Scott (especially after his track record on epics), and were sadly disappointed with Kingdom of Heaven.I was as well, until I picked up the four disc director's cut which is vastly superior to the theatrical pile of garbage we had to see. Things make more sense, and there is a greater depth given to Balian and Sybilla's character. I won't go into the spoilers, but its much more satisfying to watch.If you are an epic lover, and a DVD collecting maniac, why haven't you gotten the director's cut yet?

702,Greenwarrior4,Summary!,8,29 May 2005,"Kingdom of Heaven: Gladiator, but about the Crusades. I thought that this movie was very impressive. It did have some minor flaws, such as the speed of the movie. At some parts, it didn't seem to flow. The parts that were cut out was very noticeable. I would rather have a satisfying, long movie than a mediocre short one. This is the case with Kingdom of Heaven. The plot could have been meatier, yet the details were cut out. As for the acting, it was well done. Other than Balian, I like King Baldwin. He loves Jerusalem and his people; he is a very good king with a tragic fate. Orlando Bloom did a good job playing Balian- the character need not be too rough, but magnetic. It was an essential characteristic that Orlando needed to have in order for his knight role to be convincing. And he succeeds. I know that Kingdom of Heaven will pave the way for his future career. Balian is also sensitive. He cares for his people, for the good will of the people. He is selfless and giving. I think Orlando brought out that part in him with great emotion. I thought he did a great job in the beginning of the movie being silent and in a depression after his wife's suicide. He lost his entire family, so it only makes sense to have Balian numb and quiet. And besides, he has plenty of time to open up later on in the movie. The supporting cast also did a good job. It complimented the movie in many ways. I would have liked it if each character had more time to develop, but because of the deleted scenes, they do not have time to fully develop. Take the romance between Balian and Sybilla, for example. The two of them exchanged only a few words before the love scene. I was hoping for a believable, likable love story- here it is only assumptions of feelings of affection towards each other. It was an exceptional movie, but it definitely could have been better if the plot wasn't cut short and the characters were explored deeply, as in Gladiator. And for those people who are complaining that this is a bad movie because of historical inaccuracy, COME ON!! This is a movie, for heaven's sake! I know for a fact that William Monahan spent 19 whole months writing the script on accurate research. So don't go saying that it's not accurate. If there are some inaccurate aspects, it's again a movie... a Hollywood film. Hollywood always tends to twist things around to make it more appealing to the general audience.

It was choppy, too fast at times, too slow at others, and I felt like Monahan was constantly ""popping the clutch""--talk about getting plot whiplash! What ever happened to good character development? That's the writer's job, not the actors, believe it or not. I have to hand it to the actors, they did well. I think they all deserved a better script. Just because the premise of the story is good doesn't mean that's all you need for a good screenplay. There's so much missing.

706,mulletted,An Epic Disappointment,6,15 May 2005,"It is sad to see director Ridley Scott, who has filmed such classics as ""Blade Runner"" and ""Alien"", be content with creating sub par faux-historical films, such as ""Gladiator"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"". I know that many people liked ""Gladiator"" and it is a better film than ""Kingdom of Heaven"", but both films aren't very good. Scott's use of extremely quick cuts, while supposedly attempting to show the speed and insanity of battle, only serve to confuse and disorient the audience. It worked for ""Braveheart"", but does every film about war now have to have quick-cuts? Besides that minor quibble, the real problem with ""Kingdom of Heaven"" lies with the paper-thin plot. As I sat through the film, I felt as if Scott tried to compress his film into a certain amount of time, thereby sacrificing the story. Orlando Bloom (of whom I am not a fan) doesn't give any depth to Balian, who is already shallowly fleshed out by the script. His ""romance"" with the King of Jerusalem's sister isn't developed and seems thrown in simply to give female viewers a complimentary shot of Orlando Bloom in the buff. Saladain, a very interesting (REAL) character is given little screen time, which highlights a big problem of mine with the film, the complete emphasis on the Christian characters of the film. For a film that preaches tolerance and understanding other religions, it doesn't even take the time to allow us to really get to know any of the Muslim characters, who interest me far more than any of the other characters. The highlight of the film is Jeremy Irons, who is simply wonderful as the Marshal of Jerusalem. He deserved more screen time, which could have been provided had Scott cut down on the mandatory close-up shots of Bloom and his boyish good looks, which litter the film. I don't suggest anyone see this film in the theaters because it is a huge disappointment, even though it had so much potential not only to teach, but to entertain.

Why would Ridley Scott make another ""Gladiator"" movie and one as long and boring as this one! The battle scenes were better in Braveheart, Lord of the Rings, Gladiator, etc. In fact, there's a scene that mirrors Lord of the Rings to a T. It's almost like Helms Deep. Orlando Bloom is again defending a wall of a huge fortress, there are bow and arrows flying, sword fighting, it almost looked like the same set! For Orlando Bloom, he just can't carry this movie. He's boring. And the movie is about a half hour too long. And if Bloom's character just accepts being King there wouldn't have been a war, innocent people wouldn't have died, and everyone would have been saved. But for some reason he can't be King cause it wouldn't be right. Great sound design but the musical score is trying to hard to be an epic.

708,rekkaus,Two and a half hours of boredom,3,30 April 2005,"Ridley Scott's latest 'epic' is an exercise in utter boredom. There's nothing here we haven't seen many times before; there's no heart nor soul and 'lackluster' is a word that keeps popping to my mind. If you've seen LOTR - Return of the King, there's nothing here to impress you when it comes to massive battle sequences either.Orlando Bloom, while apparently a handsome heart-throb, is genuinely lacking when it comes to charisma and screen presence. He's utterly incapable of carrying a movie of these proportions, facing all hardships with that same bland look of non-expression. Where's the grief, the sadness, the surprise, the despair, the love? Not in Balian of Ibelin, that's for sure. Give Bloom 10 years of acting school, a whole lot of grim life experience and a series of dramatic, demanding roles, and he might grow up into a serious thespian, finally capable of taking on roles such as this.Exposition is the name of the game here; nothing much happens unless it has a bearing on the story later on. You can also expect a great number of very unlikely but dramatically oh-so-necessary coincidences, some of which are simply ridiculous when considered on their own.Oh yes, and then there's the dialogue. Stilted, stunted, take your pick. Characters act like they know their words are being recorded for posterity, investing every word with serious, earth-shattering importance. Apparently there's also a fair bit of telepathy going round, as characters rarely see any need for more than a couple of short sentences to each other.What most irks me is the way Scott and the writers fail to provide any serious criticism of the Crusades and the amount of suffering caused by the Pope's mad grab for Jerusalem. The only actual baddies in the movie are very obviously rotten to the core, and the movie seems to place the blame for the bloodshed squarely on their shoulders - almost like the Crusades would've been a pleasant romp in the countryside if it weren't for these two bad apples.Organized religion is responsible for more death and suffering than anything else in our history. Kingdom of Heaven was perfectly positioned for pointing this out once and for all, but Scott & co. wasted the opportunity. Instead, the movie seems to emphasize the message of ""negotiation is always preferable to war"" which, while admirable and true, feels a bit badly timed preceded by some serious bloodshed and carnage.All in all, a huge disappointment and a massive waste of time, resources and effort.",Kingdom of Heaven

710,Blackthorn9,Amazing.,10,7 May 2005,"This film is amazing. That is the first major point. Despite the main star, it is an incredible work. The other comments about it being ''Braveheart in the Sun'' are way off- for a start, Braveheart looked nowhere near as accurate as this, nor did Braveheart manage as many complex emotional scenes. Braveheart substituted large sections of plot and historical accuracy for mass battle-scenes with shaky camera effects. This film is out to show the futility of the Holy War and to speak about religious and cultural tolerance, and how the belligerent few will always force a war between two otherwise peacefully co-existing nations. And demonstrate it it did. But the other thing you have to admire about this film is the degree of authenticity. Yes, any expert could pick at the weave a bit, but ultimately, it looked stunning, and real. The battle-scenes were bloodily realistic, not glorifying or decrying war, but like Gladiator showing it for what it is, no more, no less.

711,gh0ti-2,Great film - but slightly rushed beginning,9,7 May 2005,"First I'd just like to outline how much I enjoyed this film. The cast were by and large excellent, say what you will about the monotonous tone of Orlando Bloom. The special effects are superb, on a par with any other epic produced in recent years and Scott handles the direction of the battle scenes well.Yet, I was fairly frustrated by the opening half an hour of the film, where the script appears to be in a desperate rush to get Balian to Jerusalem to avoid a 4 hour plus epic. His father is barely introduced before Bloom's character decides to murder a priest and follow him to the holy land seeking redemption, and is then delivered a mortal wound in the next scene. This hurried start makes it difficult to feel involved by the story later on, particularly with the death of Hospitaler, which had little emotional impact.But all that said, the second half of the film makes up for it, with a fast-moving story with impressive scope, that remarkably steers clear of controversy despite the sensitivity of the issues it deals with.",Kingdom of Heaven
712,rhubby,More Accurate than most people give Scott credit for,9,8 May 2005,"(Maybe spoilers below, if you follow some links and do some research) There have been several criticism's of this film in newspapers (Jeff Simon , buffalo news) NPR, and other places, including IMDb where the premise of the movie is called into question.First, allow me to point out that Ridley Scott does an excellent job of capturing a book/event/history, and putting it on the screen for the average user to understand. ""Black Hawk Down"", captured the raid in somolia to a T, even if some things had to be done to fit the 18 hour action into a 2 hour movie.""Kingdom of Heaven"" is no different from that standpoint. The character Balin is introduced as a way of giving a modern viewer some kind of touchstone to the middle ages. After that 'unreality' of Scott creating a character for the viewer to empathise with, everything else (outside of Balin) is fairly historical, Although i don't think we would want all of Saladin's 10 year campaign on the screen in real time. Scott brilliantly picks out the salient events and arranges them on the screen.In a nutshell, Saladin was closer to the 'Christian Chivalric' ideal than most Christians of the time (or now, for that matter), Raynauld, Guy were both fanatic jerks, just like in the movie.Saladin knew how the Christian army would fight, and planned accordingly, and he eventually took Jerusalem, without the kind of massacre that accompanied the Christian taking of Jerusalem.""But what about the political correctness?""Is it 'politically correct' to want to stay alive? The leadership of Jerusalem, up until Guy was crowned king, understood that they were Christian leaders of a mostly Moslem population. Had they tried to tow the 'hard line' the locals would have staged a revolt and wiped out the king and everyone else (common events in the middle ages). So, Balwin IV (who was a leper) continually fought against anyone trying to provoke a war. After his death, Guy (one of the newcomers spoiling for a fight) undid all of that work as quickly as he could, went out and got a severe ass whooping. Raynauld's death was portrayed as most accounts have it (whether they are myth or not, I have not determined, but Scott is consistent with the standard tale)All in all, I personally liked the movie. It was exciting, had excellent special effects, a looming sadness (you pretty much know how it will end). (hence my rating).As for criticism, if you don't like the movie, fine. If you don't like the device of placing a more 'modern' character into the story, fine (but then i ought to find you reading the Canterbury Tales in its original form, for 'authenticity')But don't slam it because you think the concept of the leaders of Jerusalem wanting peace is absurd. That is one of the places where Scott hits the arrow right in the target.",Kingdom of Heaven
713,bjornjohren,Historical epic thing,7,8 May 2005,"I liked this movie because it contained more than the usual underdog versus big dog(?)-sequence. There are several levels to this movie so that everyone get their own favorite part. If you don't like history, be it European, Christian or whatever you should probably just put the old Lord of the Rings DVD into the (you guessed it) DVD-player and watch that (trilogy) again. However if you like a movie that actually brings forth some of the truth (of that period)then this is it. Don't you just love crusades. Okay, that was the comment for the movie itself but I would also like to comment on the acting. I don't really know why, but I'm a big fan of Jeremy Irons' acting though he doesn't play that large a role in this movie. One person who does play a large role and thankfully does it well is Lego... sorry... Orlando Bloom. It's his best performance yet, well it's better than in the trilogy at least, but being casted as a blacksmith who turns into a hero person several times (two times so far + one in the making) may not be the best thing. But what do I know, I'm no cynical reviewer who gets paid to watch movie. I actually have to wait until the movie is released and then I have to pay to get a ticket thus I choose movies that I believe i'd like.",Kingdom of Heaven
714,SDMovieMaven,"A bit rushed, but as subtle and moving as it is exciting...",7,8 May 2005,"Pros: Engaging characters and story, stunning cinematography, artful dialogue, believable action. As with Gladiator, Scott's compassionate rendering of historical war heroes obsessed with honor softens the brutality of reality, but it certainly makes for good drama. Scott has pulled it off once again for an enjoyable 2+ hours. As the scenes flew by, I found myself increasingly enthralled by the unfolding relationships in the film. And of course it was especially refreshing to see ancient Islamic cultures depicted as slightly more sophisticated than their European contemporaries. Although the film wasn't more than I expected, I was surprisingly moved.Cons: Much of the acting is a tad subtle for mainstream American audiences. As is the humor. I found myself laughing aloud several times in an otherwise silent theater. Also, the film felt a bit ""squished"" to me, as if significant setup scenes had been cut. I'll look forward to the director's version for a more even rhythm.",Kingdom of Heaven

Overall this movie was excellent. I would definitely see it again, and do plan on purchasing when it comes out on DVD. The additional actors, Liam Neeson, Eva Green, Jeremy Irons, and David Thewlis, etc., are fabulous.The scenery is great, and looks like the city of Jerusalem has always been there. I loved the costuming as well as the reality of the weapons and war machinery--very authentic-looking. It may be a little graphic for smaller kids, but tweens and up would enjoy it, and maybe learn something about the Crusades of 1180's and perhaps gain some insight to the conflicts of today.

They way every shot looks so well planned, and every location so real and beautiful. Ridley really knows how to make a movie epic. I really enjoyed this movie. I felt the story was fantastic. The special effects were up to par with todays visuals, and the acting..top notch. With the exception of Orlando Bloom. I also agree that he is one of the most overrated actors today. No matter what era he is in, or what role, he acts pretty much the same. I do applause his effort to appear more adult and serious in this film, but he still has a long way to go. I also feel that some of the battles in this movie have got to be the most accurate depictions of what it must have been like. He really captures the chaos and brutality of it. Rumour has it that an hour was cut... you can tell. The pacing is very off.

The combat scenes were vexedly chaotic, and the sound editing was poor. The soundtrack was sub-par  far from stellar. The supporting staff was far too far in the background  only Salahedîn and his general shone as Bloom's character did, with far less screen exposure  if anything, they should have received more.Overall, although certain scenes rung true, I found the overall story-telling a tad cluttered, messy and forced. The events felt downright contrived on too many occasions. This film is not, in essence the story of the Kingdom of Heaven, but of one Knight. The film should have been called ""the Crusader"" (for Orlando Blooms' character), even though this would have been an unpopular term.I would say rushed to screen, perhaps 2 weeks ahead of its time, to avoid the Star Wars glut is my best guess.Final judgment: 6/10 (Orlando pulled it up from 5/10).",Kingdom of Heaven
718,Man-Tyler,Visually brilliant but in my opinion lacking real drama,6,11 May 2005,"Undoubtedly Ridley Scott is one of the greatest directors of our days and provides the audience with fascinating and captivating imagery. Without any doubt I rank the production design, the costumes and the battle scenes of his latest movie Kingdom of Heaven among the best I've ever seen including The Lord of the Rings-Trilogy, Braveheart and Mr Scott's own Gladiator. Unfortunately, his tale from the medieval crusades does not reach the dramatical content and density of both the movies I compare this one to and the ""historical events"" I've researched for almost three years now. I really wanted to enjoy this picture and was eager to see things and situations that only existed in my imagination (or a millennium ago) and to be honest this movie fulfilled these expectations sometimes! But it did not move me the way I expect a major Hollywood production should if it is about immense historical events with quite large relevance to our present societies and religions. My reasons for this opinion may be a spoiler to those who know little about the years 1180-1200 A.D. in the Middle East, therefore: Beware! I do realize that a good motion picture follows its own rules and must not restrict its script to orderly historical events for the story's sake. Still, I think this mission has not been accomplished by the writers. In deed they changed quite a lot detail which added up to a misinterpretation of the historical events. Christians and Muslims who fought each other then (and before Saladin both fought themselves, too!) are all portrayed very idealistic and liberal (obviously except for the ""evil Knights Templar!"". Most historians, though, underline the fact that both sides were consumed by their political and financial interests and some kind of religious fundamentalism. Still they arranged to live in each other vicinity. There are even reports from then that Muslims and Christians played together on the battlefields in the evenings on to beat up the other the next morning! This schizophrenic situation bears in my opinion more potential for drama than has been explored by the screen writers. This writing 'failure' (I admit that there are some nice scenes)leads to my heaviest criticism. At the end of the film, after the battle of Hattin where Guy crushes his Christian Army, the Muslims siege Jerusalem. Prior to the battle Saladin demanded that Jerusalem was given too him in peace and nobody would die. After the defeat at Hattin Balian had four days to improve the defense of the city (in reality almost 10 weeks passed)and Saladin who was introduced as a wise and calm and reasonable person did not even repeat his offer to let the Christians leave in peace. But then after fierce fighting and many deaths Balian decided that he must save the citizens' lives which his father has already taught him early in the film (back in Italy.)So, why did he fight at all and wasted some simple people's lives??? I know he wanted to defend the city in order to reach forgiveness of all sins but even though I'm pious myself, I didn't buy it! This lack of credibility sums up my reservation towards this monumental motion picture about faith, chivalry, tolerance and guilt.",Kingdom of Heaven
719,Ridley_Scott,One of the best movies of our time!,7,5 September 2006,"Kingdom of Heaven (The Director's Cut) is an exceptional film and one that will probably be more respected and understood in the future, than in our current times. The plot, the acting, cinematography, musical score, and special effects are all top-notch and what you'd expect from director Ridley Scott. The movie truly is an epic in every sense of the word and the message of peace and tolerance given by the movie is desperately needed in the world today.I noticed that a lot of the bad reviews for the movie (theatrical version) were motivated by politics and not much else. The times we live in are quite sad and over-politicized. It's annoying that some people can't enjoy the movie for what it is and instead must turn it into a political issue.This film deserves a 10/10.

It was missing something, maybe a lead character played by someone better than Orlando Bloom? Anyway, I just finished an outstanding book called ""Warriors of God, Richard the Lionheart and Saladin in the Third Crusade"" by James Reston. Too bad another attempt with this material couldn't be made about the Crusades. I wish Hollywood could make some more great historical movies. Why is it so hard.

Whilst not Christian myself, the film irritated the crap out of me as it was another typical 'bag out on the majority' and a typical poke at Medieval Europe (Remember, we can thank Europe for almost -everything- we have today!) and the Christian religion.The religious and political propaganda in this film is quite blatant, the lefties in Hollywood need to learn we're not going to all become communist sycophantic Hebrew's just because they keep feeding us this tripe.It's really disappointing to see this stuff hitting the silver screen, many, MANY directors and actors will be rolling in their graves over such a misuse of a great movie made into a propaganda soap box.

722,synaesthesia999,Director's Cut infinitely improves theatrical version,8,8 December 2006,"I originally saw Kingdom of Heaven in the theater and thankfully it was only a buck, because that's all it was worth. There were some decent battle scenes, but Orlando Bloom's Balian was terrible, there wasn't enough Liam Neeson or Jeremy Irons, and some of the situations involving the characters didn't make any sense. Well, a bunch of the problems are fixed in the director's cut, which is an excellent film. Balian still isn't quite believable as a warrior, but a lot of Bloom's acting isn't really all that bad here and I'll give him credit for playing off Neeson, Irons and Eva Green so well. Plus, the Director's Cut actually adds a whole new character to the story and his importance is so great that it's inexplicable how he was cut out of the theatrical version entirely. His presence makes Green's Sibylla a much more interesting and dramatic character, in turn making her romance with Balian more believable. Now, the editing's tighter and the pacing better, and with more story, it only enhances the already-good battle scenes into ones that the audience can care greatly about, because of their epic consequences.Despite all this, there are many epics out there that surpass it (primarily due to a better leading actor), but you can do far worse than seeing the Director's Cut of Kingdom of Heaven.",Kingdom of Heaven

I watched almost all of the parts during which I was awake. Orlando Bloom may look really nice, but can't act his way out of a paper bag (as the main interest, that is). Having all these endless battle scenes does not make you really give a damn about the characters or be involved in the story. Lord of the Rings had numerous and fantastic battle scenes, but you loved the characters. Kingdom lacked all these elements.

724,alicat427-1,Big bang.....little sizzle here and there,9,19 June 2005,"I'm very young and none of my friends wanted to see this movie with me. It was either this or House of Wax so I gladly took my history buff dad to see this. The first five minutes of this film I realized something, this was going to be a beautiful film, but not exactly the most mind twisting and thought provoking. The conflicting religions are shown well and both with equal intensity. The sets are beautiful and the soundtrack is to die for. It has a beautiful mixture of angelic choirs and middle eastern numbers. The fighting is great, very morbid at times but always good. I can't really say if this movie stays faithful to the actual events in the Crusades but it looks damn good. Now to the not so strongest point of the film.....Bloom. God love him but the boy really just can't act with the modesty, anguish, and lust needed for this film. He has one loud and passionate way of playing the whole thing...and at times it looks beautiful(such as the inauguration of the regular old Joe's turned knights) but it gets very old very quickly. Second, Eva Green, I read in the newspaper before seeing it that this was finally the role to show the world that she was truly incredible. Although she was good she wasn't that good. But she was good, she had an intensity and look that carried her very well throughout the film. Her costumes and hairstyles were some of the best. Liam Neeson sets the standards for this film as the father of Bailin. Jeremy Irons also was wonderful, and a man that usually does not get reviews but has been in every movie I've seen in the five years......Brendan Gleeson. He plays pure evil well. As does Marton Csokas. Edward Norton plays the king,he was also memorable.There are many more but I've gone on and on so finally:::::::::This movie is defiantly worth seeing but don't be ready for any intellectual conversations afterward about the state of the world then and now....etc. KOH is stunning and ready for Oscars",Kingdom of Heaven

Given Hollywood's leftist mind set I should have known that this would be a bash-Christianity, praise Islam film. Because that's what it is. Christians are portrayed as intolerant fanatics. The only Europeans who are ""good guys"" are those who disdain Christianity. Meanwhile the Muslims are shown as intellectual and wise people. I'm disgusted with myself for actually staying until the end. Plus the battle sequences were unimpressive and the computer generated scenes easy to spot.

726,kitcatcher,History Lesson,7,29 June 2005,"I greatly enjoyed Kingdom Of Heaven.However, as I watched, the 2 most exciting characters on screen were not Balian and his father, but rather Saladin and the Leper-King of Jerusalem (was he even named in the movie?).After I got home, I looked up some of the history surrounding these events. I had never heard of the Leper-King of Jerusalem. I wondered if there was any truth at all behind this movie.What I found was fascinating. Baldwin IV is an amazing character from history. His leprosy was discovered when he was still a youth. No one thought he would live very long or accomplish much, but his nobility and courage amazed them all.After appointing Guy of Lusignan as regent of the kingdom, Baldwin was offended by Guy's poor performance and deposed him in favor of his 5 year old nephew, Sybilla's son from a prior marriage, Baldwin V! Of course another regent was appointed as well. But it was about then that everything came crashing down.Through it all, Baldwin's mother, Agnes of Courtenay was always advising him (and exerting as much control as possible over him). Sybilla was apparently very dedicated to Guy and never left him as the movie portrayed; She stayed with him and moved away with him when he fell into disfavor.-------------------------------------------------------------- Okay, I know movies are always going to diverge from history and I don't expect to get my history from a movie. The problem here is that when something gets changed, it shows that decisions were made about where and when to stray from the real story. In KOH, I can't for the life of me figure out why some of the real historical events were rejected in favor of adding this blacksmith-seduced-by-a-princess story - the real events are MORE INTERESTING!Like I said, I greatly enjoyed the movie, but now that I've learned some of the ""truth"" of the real historical events, I know I'm not going to be able to watch it the same way again. I'll keep wishing Sybilla was portrayed as being more devoted, that the story was that of Baldwin vs. Saladin, that the 5 year old king had gotten some screen time! :)",Kingdom of Heaven
727,zak1991_12,An Epic that defined perfection itself... a movie that will last for an age.,10,13 August 2005,"The historical events that have been cautiously adapted by William and the legendary director Scott fairly fits with the middle aged-books that described the struggle between the Arabs, Muslims and Christians. The movie itself portrayed the struggle of two armies and the love between two people with completely different backgrounds. I enjoyed the fact that the Muslim leader Salahadin played beautifully by Ghassan Massoud is not a brutal and unforgiving leader, instead he reveals the intelligent and leadership that his people possesses. The cast is magnificently perfect for the film. i was disappointed that Liam Neeson, being an amazingly talented actor, had a short but very affecting role in the movie. Sibylla was beautifully played, showing unhesitatingly her angelic yet mysterious features. Orlando Bloom played his role almost too well... and that's showing that from being Paris in Troy to portraying the strong embodiment of Balian in KOH. in the beginning he rightly disguised his face with the expressionless visage of a man with an internal pain... and then through his journey he developed into a more confident and willing character that fitted well with the title of a knight.

731,klopotoskidj,Epic battles for the sake of epic battles... and I love it!,8,13 October 2005,"I found Kingdom of Heaven to be a particularly engaging picture. Although it's not my favorite epic battle movie of all time, I think the battles in this movie are far more interesting than in others that I have seen.But it's not just the battle scenes that are compelling. I thought the movie was well cast, even though I'm not a huge Orlando Bloom fan. He does his part justice by not over-doing it... being just the right mix of sure of himself while overwhelmed at the same time. I wish they had more for Liam Neison to do, but not everyone can survive the whole picture. Thankfully, the cast does not include any huge stars that would spoil the harmony created by a strong group of veterans mixed with young actors and plenty of unknowns.The script ebbs and flows with well-thought dialog and few clichés. Many will be bothered by the movies tendency to do away with ""backstory"" or ""character development,"" but I find it particularly comforting here. Instead of wasting time going through the family history of every character upon meeting them, the film assumes the audience knows who the character is, and focuses on the plot rather than the facts.As for the epic battles, they were plenty. This is of of the few movies I've watched where both sides hold an inherent respect for the other. Although the Muslim king is the enemy of Orlando Bloom, you still find a reason to like his character. This is also one of few movies I've seen where a battle can last for days at a time. As with all battle movies, the fighting can get tedious.I'm not sure whether the film is historically accurate or not... and I don't really care.

732,Rufius_Aelius_Vatrenus,"Dull, draggy, yet taps beautifully into the human spirit",7,25 March 2006,"I just got off watching ""Kingdom of Heaven"". Not a bad show, but annoying at some point. Although I'll say it's a rather good movie, I find it a disappointment coming from a director as great as Ridley Scott. Even a great director like Scott makes mistakes, and ""KoH"" is where he made his most obvious. His first mistake was filling the up the movie almost entirely with drama and much less on war. The dramatics carry on much much longer than the fight sequences. Being a Ridley Scott fan (he's my fav director), I've seen a number of his movies and I've come to realize that he scores in his battle sequences. The war-intro in ""Gladiator"" was amazing, he hacked it up in ""Black Hawk Down"", and made something interesting with the battles in ""1412"". His dramas, though are good, do not measure up to his battles. Unfortunately, he failed to put to good use his incredible skill in direction of battle scenes for this movie. His second mistake was casting Orlando Bloom as the main character. Although the lad did do a fine job and certainly showed that his abilities reach further than his looks suggest, and I'd nod to his acting, he was not really up to shouldering the weight of a movie of this scale. Third mistake was almost the same as what Oliver Stone made with ""Alexander"". Scott sort of 'told' the battles rather than showed it. He just shot the armies marching out and the next thing you see are cadavers spread across the battlefield. Scott presented the armies powerfully, did a good job showing off the grandioseness of the army, making me as an audience look forward to one hell of a good time when the armies meet. He shot beautifully the march out and the advance, but after that? The armies in the movie are, according to my estimates n calculations, at least 4 times of the ones of ""TROY"", yet the battles in ""TROY"" are at least 4 times the ones of ""KoH"". The gathering and the marching of the armies took longer than the battles themselves! The final siege of Jerusalem was smart, that's it. The only hand-to-hand combat was at the end, which lasted 1 minute in the Spartans-at-Thermopylae style. So there really wasn't much action going on. I also noted the details. At one point, during the siege, Balian was trying to get to another point of the battlements. He had his sword with him in his scabbard. But for reasons unknown, he decided he needed another sword and so, drew one from a nearby soldier's scabbard and ran off, hence leaving that poor guy unarmed and helpless in the heat of battle on the front line of the battlement. And after that Balian tossed aside that sword and drew his own. That point might have been overlooked by Scott, cos to me, it made Balian look like a selfish and a sort of 'scramble-minded' guy. Another was the bishop's words, ""Who are you? Do you think you can change the World? Does making a man a knight make him a better fighter?"" And Balian replies, ""Yes."" And the following shots of the men's faces make it all seem true. I say no. Making a man a knight raises his esteem, his morale, his courage, but it does nothing to boost his ability to fight. Sure, raising those war veterans and trained soldiers to knighthood may have made them better fighters. They've already got the skill they need, all they need now is a boost of heart. But what of the rest? The servant boy, the farmer, the farrier? No matter how brave or how confident, a man who does not know how to wield a sword the proper way will meet his end in moments, in knighthood or servant-hood. The movie was pretty slow, draggy, would've been dry if not for the many fine actors and the moments where Scott's great directing pulled through. The magazine FiRST tag-lined it ""Bigger than Gladiator. Better than TROY. Busts Alexander into pieces."" The construction of Jerusalem & the surrounding forts and castles do not match the construction of the Colosseum & the Roman city and provinces. The fight sequences and battle scenes between the 2 religions could not hold a candle to the scope and detail of those between the 2 nations. And although the dramatization of the French crusader with the people around him is a lil' better than that of the Greek conqueror with those around him, I don't think 'bust into pieces' is the right term for it. Still, I applaud Scott for the camera work, the element effects, and the unbiased view he gave the movie where he takes no sides, where both enemies fight for a just cause, how he displays the humanity of each character instead of sainting them. ""KoH"" has the down-to-earthness and the realism of the characters' humanity which ""TROY"", unfortunately, seems to lack somewhat. For lovers of human drama, this is a great movie for you. For lovers of period war, I doubt you'll be too amused. However, I recommend all period epic lovers to catch it. But I certainly say that Scott's earlier blockbuster hit ""Gladiator"" overshadows ""KoH"", and certainly sets the bar for period epics. Out of 10 stars, I'd give ""Kingdom of Heaven"" an 7, for fine storytelling but not for detail.",Kingdom of Heaven

Viewed as a failure by many critics and fans, Ridley Scott went with a different approach in this movie. It feels unfamiliar, which I suppose accounts for people's dislike. However, Ridley Scott is a master and creates a work of art with the camera. Orlando Bloom became a man in the movie, ably playing the struggling young knight. And with a supporting cast such as the one surrounding him, you can't go wrong. Harry Gregson-Williams beautiful score adds a sweet layer to William Monahan's profound script.

If Director Ridley Scott Wasn't enough inspiration to rate this movie high then the brilliance portrayed by the actors is. Orlando Bloom's Balian was a humble man that wanted nothing more then forgiveness for his sins. His father played by the excellent Liam Neeson was equally inspiring as he made sure Balian remembered his oath. Edward Norton as the King was another brilliant casting move as he displayed his character so well without ever showing his face. And with Jeremy Irons as the old cavalier that took his people from those lands. Even Eva Green did a stunning job.

Is it for the actors, the story, the period, the costumes or because of who the Director is? Is it because of Orlando? If it is only for Orlando, then that is a shame because a) If you don't like him, it may put you off the whole film b) it might only be him that you watch on screen and not what is going on around him c) his performance is not as epic as the rest of the film. There was no getting around it for me. I really wanted to like him as the lead and it's not that he was completely unbelievable. However, if he intended to come across as a one-dimensional character with no emotion, well, he succeeded. There were a lot of things going on around him, and it won't spoil it for you to say that these things included, among other things, war, death and love. Despite all these things going on around him, he seemed to take them all in his stride, as if he was expecting them. A little emotion at the key moments would have helped a lot, as it is the small dramatic 'character' moments in film that make it truly unforgettable. Take 'Gladiator' which I guess can be used as a good comparison not least because of the director. We can all agree the fight sequences were great, but what made the movie was us believing all the time what motivated Maximus and his desire was never in doubt. The glue that held the whole thing together were the quieter moments, and this is what made the action more meaningful. In 'Kingdom' Orlando's character was a closed book. We never really 'get' what makes him tick or get any idea of his motivation. He just seems to go with the flow and never gets too emotionally involved.Hence, neither do we. Watch the scene between Edward Norton's character and his sister in the film to get an idea of what I'm trying to say about 'quieter moments'. Instead, we rely on the superb Liam Neeson, Jeremy Irons, Brendan Gleeson, David Thewlis and Edward Norton to carry the emoting side of things. These guys have been around and know what they are doing with this material. I'm afraid Orlando's character lacked the gravitas, charisma and 'hardness' that would make me believe he could do what he did. But Ridley Scott proves again that he can make a film look gorgeous. From the opening shots in the snow to the battles, costumes, sets, locations, extras, the film oozed authenticity for me. I felt that, in 'Gladiator',one could see, occasionally, where reality ended and Computer Generated Imagery began.Here, the technology was spot on and I couldn't see a single join. If the idea of this sort of film is for you, as it is for me, then you will not be disappointed by it. It provides what it promises and packs a more emotional punch than many of the recent 'epics', which have largely been a let down, considering the star power and money invested in most of them.In summary then, it looks fantastic and also feels authentic but would have been better with a slighter older 'weathered' lead to provide the missing element.",Kingdom of Heaven

739,ajweiner-1,Some things never change.,10,3 December 2005,"This movie is the most underrated of '05. The subject matter is so relevant and a brilliant looking glass into the past. The underlying theme and complexity of uncovering the elusive ability of any race, religion or state to control the city of Jerusalem up until this very day, is probably the key to peace on Earth. The way that Ridley Scott tackles the complexity of the subject is awesome and inspiring.The special features disc on the DVD is as good and as important as the movie itself.When I first saw the trailers in the theatres, I remember being terribly disappointed on how it looked like and felt like a rehashed Gladiator (on my top 10 of all time). But now after finally experiencing this movie, the production featurettes and the special history A&E reels, it reassures me that not only is Ridley Scott one of the top 3 living directors (with Spielberg & Scorsese), but the wisdom that he possesses that allowed him to prove to ""Hollywood"" with Gladiator that the genre would be accepted and successful, would also allow him to fulfill a spiritual and childhood dream... again it is truly inspirational!",Kingdom of Heaven

I went in a group of six to see this movie, expecting it to be another Ridley Scott masterpiece (Gladiator is in my top 3 of favorite movies), and myself and one other were the only ones that managed to actually stay awake during the whole thing. The story lacked character development, and even the epic battle scenes, though beautifully shot, were very boring. Nothing in this movie was original. I expected this movie to be right up my alley, because I love historical war movies, but the movie as a whole was about as entertaining as a tranquilizer.

741,raiderking69,A completely underrated film and better than the overrated Gladiator!,10,5 January 2006,"--A lot of negative comments have been made about Orlando Bloom's characterization of Balian, all with no insight. The main character is forced to go through several emotional developments in the first few minutes of the film while maintaining an individual of personal integrity. Not many actors can do this, a fine example of how no to do this is Brad Pitt's acting skills in Troy when placed opposite the phenomenal Peter O' Toole, he came up short. Bloom carried it off with integrity and realistically. Liam Neeson as is usual does a fine job as Godfrey and the unrecognizable Michael Csokas as Guy dus Lusignon was creatively arrogant as well as short-sighted. I was completely unable to recognize either voice or mannerisms with the Leper King Baldwin the IV, who is hidden behind a mask, I was happy with the performance and thrilled to see it was Oscar-Nominated star Edward Norton. My favorite Character performance was given by David Thewlis playing Hospitaler of the Order of St. John. As always Thewlis knows when to play understated and when not to go over the top. If their was a weakness in this film it was I didn't get enough of Jeremy Irons as the Knight-Marshall Tiberius.

Not being his greatest fan myself I wasn't preparing myself to see something great. I was not wrong. This film is boring, too long and confusing. Orlando Bloom- who is supposed to be the main character- utters few words throughout the whole film. The battles are short (except for the one at the end) the actors are poor, the filming is terrible and the locations are very dull and dark. It is very long (over 2 hours) and I had lost the will to live after the first five minutes of watching it. Even my friend said how it was dull and predictable. It only improves in the last twenty minutes where there is a battle and stars to become clear what is going on.

It has to be said I didn't agree before hand with the choice for the main lead. I have always thought Orlando bloom to be quite green at acting, and I wasn't even sure he would actually make it into a good actor one day.Now to the point. People here have said that the film is weak. That is not Braveheart (Thank God for that!!! with all the respect for Mr. Gibson, whose smile makes my day every time I see it!), or that it's not Gladiator (thank God as well! The Gladiator was an incredible film no doubt about it, but if I wanted to see Gladiator, I would play Gladiator... I don't know if I make myself clear...). People put it down, sometimes, precisely to Mr. Bloom's acting.Oh well... I have to say I found Orlando Bloom not only wonderful, but very much on the level of his outstanding cast! he blew me, just like the rest of the film. The picture is magic, the story gripping (OK, just a knight's story, but, one knew that and hoped for that at the time of paying for it), and to the end I was left not knowing what would happen, which is always a plus.The only but I can give you, to my taste, is the special effects in the battles, and the amount of gore, that seems to be so much of the like of modern directors. But still, Mr. Scot left it down to the minimums, and they didn't bother me in the slightest.In the whole a great film that I will enjoy again and again.Please forgive my poor English, and I hope, if you do watch it, you like it too.",Kingdom of Heaven

However, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the picture's history component played a leading role and fairly accurately - yet the story overlaid on it was very moving. The ""sex scenes"" were almost non-existent and were not offensive. Also, the violence, while unavoidable and certainly historically authentic, was not gratuitous. Indeed, the goriest moments seemed to be passed over very quickly. ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is probably too philosophical, intelligent, and (yes) historical to be a gate-receipts blockbuster, but it is well worth anyone's time to see it - and not just once.",Kingdom of Heaven

When the Director's Cut came out it was 45 minutes longer, so you fear the worst, MORE of the same. In this case, the story line is filled out and the motivations and characters are fleshed out. Eva Green went from, ""why is she in this movie"" with virtually no screen time and less dialog to a major character who moves the plot, as you would hope given her billing. The opening scenes in France are greatly expanded and meaningful. The action scenes are better, but not substantially. The Director's cut should have been the official version of the movie, the theatrical cut is a poor excuse.",Kingdom of Heaven
746,dextercornell,Un unfair portrait of the Crusades,5,12 May 2005,"Kingdom of Heaven is a movie good realized from a technical view even if it has weakness both on the side of casting (Orlando Bloon is a one face actor and has a too pretty look to characterize a knight of the crusades ages)and plot (the way Liam Neeson reveals to be his father is too superficial and the way a horse survive to the sinking of the ship is simply ridiculous). Moreover we don't find in it the great epic air of other movies: i.e. watching the battles of Lord Of the Rings you feel very involved in the drama... you almost feel pain to your stomach; instead in this movie you see the fighting scenes with historical eyes, similar if it has to be a scientific question. Then we came to the historical matter. The way Ridley Scott treat both parts, Christians ad Muslims, is out of doubt unfair. All we see is that the Saladin was a wise man (and it is historically true) and that all the Christians are evil with rare exceptions. In particular we see that the strong evil parties of the Christianity mission are the Templar knights: this is historically proved to be false. In many studies is reported that Templar Knights were considered by the Muslims the most brave, respected and wise fighters among their enemies... sure we are talking about war!!!. Many times were Templars themselves that bargained peace treatment with Muslims chiefs in place of the King of Jerusalem.I think this movie reflect the atmosphere that rules in the occidental civilization in the last decades.

749,dutchman639,"Good, but with several inaccuracies.",7,22 August 2006,"I thought the movie in general was very good. For once it did not depict bad Muslims with perhaps a few fanatic Christians thrown in, but instead it depicted most Christians as blindly religious while the Muslims were fanatic but fair. Also they depicted the timeperiod really well, the only mistake I noticed was a doctor in the beginning describing bone marrow and blood circulation. (Something at the time they knew nothing about.)The one thing that did constantly bug me was that the movie was set up too easily make Orlando Bloom look like the innocent, loyal poor man. The extent to which Guy de Lusignan was portrayed as arrogant and stupid made it obvious that Balian would get Eva Green. (Also her saying that she did not choose her husband made it all too stereotypical.) Also, on the way to Jerusalem Balian (Bloom) barely knows how to hold a sword and can only work as a blacksmith, yet when he arrives in Jerusalem he somehow is the only person who can figure out that an army needs water. (As far as I know from history, the templars were never that naive and there was never just one person arguing against this. (And certainly not a random blacksmith from France.) Also,Bloom also seems to be the only one magically figure after 5 minutes out that there is water under his new found land, despite his slaves' families having lived there for ages. These rants I just put forth really are only details to some, so it might just seem that I'm complaining. I just found that they too easily opened the path for Bloom to do the obvious and save the day.APART from that I really did think it was a good movie, with the various battle scenes and the settings all keeping in line with the timeperiod.",Kingdom of Heaven

I think he needs more seasoning. Actually, a lot more. Regardless as to what some of the critics say, I think this is a very good movie. Not perfect, but very good. Some of the critics I think wanted to see another Gladiator when they saw that the movie would be directed by Ridley Scott. Some of the comments I think was just nitpicking.

752,citizen-49817,Kingdom of world building,9,3 November 2019,"I feel this movie, while not flawless, is misunderstood on many levels, and I'll try to explain why.First of all, watch (and review) the Director's cut, as the butchered Theatrical version is practically a different movie.KoH is a layered movie set in a time of confrontation of two worlds, each with it's respective ""perfect knight"" to lead it which culminates in their confrontation at the end. It follows historically accurate major events of 1180s, but the movie is not and does not try to be historically accurate, as that is not its purpose. Rather than being a history lesson, the movie uses the setting to tackle a great deal of eternal human concepts: loyalty, love, chivalry, honor, charity, cruelty, religion, reason - to name a few. Therefore, historical accuracy is in many regards secondary, in favor of telling a story and exploring these topics. This works very well for the major part of the movie, but it's not without its flaws. One must critically consider where this artistic liberty is warranted, and where it's not.Let's start with the negative side: there is merit to certain criticism of this movie regarding it's heavy-handedness, enough to deduct a review star. The Templars are serving the purpose of being the main villains, the epitome of cruelty; the worst Christianity has to offer. The movie goes so far as to make the two main bad characters, Guy and Reynald, Templars. While the movie takes many artistic liberties, Guy and Reynald could have used some better backgrounds rather than making them Templars, which they could not have been as the Templars were a monastic order, and thus could not own land or inherit. While being fierce fighters, the Templars probably understood the situation in the Holy Land better than the western newcomers, and would have probably been less likely to attack civilians and break the truce than the new western arrivals. The killing of Saladin's sister by Reynald, another artistic liberty (Saladin sister was never killed by Franks), feels undeserved and heavy-handed, it's purpose being to bring Reynald beyond redemption and to give a just cause to Saladin. These characters, Guy, Reynald and even Saladin could have benefitted from a more nuanced motivation in this regard. This is the worst bit of the story in this movie in my view.On the note of the movie portraying all Christians as bad and cruel, nothing could be farther from the truth. While the movie makes a point to show the misguided fanaticism of the time, it ultimately shows the good side of Christianity as well. This is personified in many characters: the bishop in the Frank village, Godfrey, the Hospitaller, the King. These characters are able to separate the blind dogmatic religion from the true values of Christianity, ones of a sound mind, and a kind heart. On the other hand, the blindness of Islamic conquest is shown as well, personified in the Caliph that rebukes Saladin on his decision to retreat from Kerak, rather than to press the attack because god will give them victory.The fact that Saladin was portrayed much more honorably that he historically was should be considered in the context that both Balian and the Leper King were also lifted to the status of ""perfect knights"" in turn. This serves the narrative purpose of pitting Balian and Saladin against each other while themselves are struggling with the inner conflict of meeting the expectations of their people on one hand and acting honorably on the other. This is cleverly shown in the scene when Balian asks ""What is Jerusalem worth?"", and Saladin says ""nothing"" - as to him personally Jerusalem probably does not mean much, and ""everything"" - as conquering it will justify his position as the ruler of the Muslim world and fulfil his people's expectations from him. The fact that these men were enemies did not prevent them from acting honorably towards the other side whenever they could.The movie absolutely shines when it comes to the cast, the atmosphere and the beautiful musical score. Scott's world building and design is flawless and deeply immerses the viewer. It is probably matched only in Jackson's LoTR trilogy. No scene feels superfluous in the Director's cut. Even with the mentioned historical quirks, the flaws in this movie are not nearly enough to justify considering it anything but an excellent film. Personally, for the reasons described, I'll go with 9/10.Do yourself a favor and give KoH (DC) a watch.",Kingdom of Heaven

I saw the Spanish language version which was disappointing because the dubbed voices were so much the same, but even that didn't stop the thrills. It is one of the most beautiful movies I've seen, rather in the mode of Lawrence of Arabia, and the horses were amazing, but one note...they were all Arabian, and I believe that heavy chargers (like Percherons) were really used, especially by the Crusaders, since Crusader armor, with the man inside it, were too heavy to be supported by the fragile legs of Arabians. I couldn't help wondering how many horses were injured, .....as well as stunt men taking headers off their saddles and crashing to the ground in a welter of shields and spears and other bodies. I thought some of the battle scenes were a tad longer than necessary and perhaps a bit much blood spraying the screen, which was effective, I have to admit, in bringing the action right into my living room! Also, I noticed one funny blooper...one character appears fighting in a battle which follows one in which he was killed! Also, I thought the big blue eyes of the Queen perhaps a little unlikely. However, who knows. The Norman Crusaders were all over the place for a long time, after all! And a tactful note at the end: Saladin, instead of standing on the cross, or kicking it aside in partisan scorn, instead picks it up and carefully places it back on the table.

This movie transported me to a place in history I know little of, but yet it's an area and a struggle that continues to be a problem in today's world. Kingdom of Heaven was bloody, but I didn't feel it too extreme, the violence worked to bring out the hero qualities of the main actors. For me, the film had an epic quality too it, and I thought Liam Neeson's performance in the first 20 minutes set the stage for the rest of the film.

Also the kinda touchy religious issues aren't too in your face to be distracting.The visuals are brilliant and you would hardly expect any different from Scott. The battle scenes from Kingdom Of Heaven are some of the best ever seen on the screen and are a great spectacle.The dialogue was adequate, but then dialogue in epics never is that pleasant to listen to in my experience.Bloom's character is kinda hard to be interested in while watching this film and while he has his moments, the supporting cast for the most part steals the show.I am glad I watched the Director's Cut rather than the Theatrical Version as the prospect of even less character depth in Kingdom Of Heaven would be a tad hard to deal with.There is no doubt in my mind that Kingdom Of Heaven is a good film. Ridley Scott has produced a picture to gladly sit alongside Gladiator.

758,juhopalmroos,As expected from Ridley Scott,8,5 February 2007,"When compared to other (semi-)historical epics, such as King Arthur or Alexander, released in the 21st century, Kingdom of Heaven was a fresh breeze of wind among muddy and rainy gusts.Most of the cast bring their respective characters to life very well - Liam Neeson is outstanding as Godfrey, Marton Csokas is the perfect choice for the film's antagonist (if there is one). Brendan Gleeson I didn't like that much - well, I have never liked him in any role :), but my ""not liking him"" doesn't influence too much on my opinion on the whole movie. As a Finn, it was a mixed feeling of national pride and slight surprise for me to see Jouko Ahola as the German crusader Odo. I'd heard that he had a small role in the movie, but I didn't expect him to have any lines. Too bad he was killed early in the movie :). To me, the most striking performance was by Edward Norton as king Baldwin IV. It's too much for words (my words, at least), one must see his performance him-/herself.As for the leading actor, Orlando Bloom, there were both good and bad things in his performance. It must've been difficult for the actor to shake the mantle of LOTR's Legolas from his shoulders - many people will remember him as ""the pretty boy from LOTR"", unfortunately. As his performance in this movie proves, he's got real talent. He's neither a ""one facial expression wonder"" nor overacting and theatrical. However, no matter how good or bad his acting, I personally don't think he was the best possible choice for Balian. Someone older and more harsh-looking would've suited better. But despite Bloom's cosmetic unadaptability, a good choice of cast and a good performance.The special effects weren't taken over the edge, points for that. The story wasn't engulfed by special effects.

I watched the theatrical cut a few years and gave up half way through as it was so boring, after reading positive reviews for the directors cut I thought I'd try again so I'd say if you didn't enjoy the original cut it's not worth spending more time and trying the directors cut as it's no better Troy, Gladiator and even Alexander directors cut are much more superior films you should spend you time watching!",Kingdom of Heaven
764,peterblades,Mr. Scott please... don't make movies like this again,2,7 January 2007,"This has to be one of Scott's worst movies. Although it's beautifully shot, it introduced Eva Green to the mainstream and it has Jeremy Irons in his cool/scarred/rough mode, everything else is just so wrong. Orlando ""Pretty wooden plank"" Bloom? WTF? A blacksmith? In medieval ages? With white teeth, skinny posture and face of a (then) pretty girl? Totally unconvincing. The same goes to the plot. Balian having a chance to remove a successor to the throne who will be a cause of a massive war and ethnic cleansing, chooses to be a noble knight with clean conscience. Basically the movie tells us that the cost of nobility and being a perfect knight is genocide, something i don't think RS intended. Bloom doesn't act in this movie he is a stage prop that says every line in the same tone we know from LOTR, Pirates and other movies who suffer his presence. The other thing: the movie is historically inaccurate. Massively. Balian threatened to wipe out Muslim population of Jerusalem and to destroy Islam's holy shrines of the Dome of the Rock and the Aqsa Mosque if the Christians weren't allowed to safely exit the city. Saladin ordered a ransom to be paid at one Frank per head when exiting the city, a lot of people couldn't afford it and were taken into slavery. Other things: Balian was 47 during the battle of Jerusalem; he wasn't a blacksmith but a legitimate Frankish lord educated in art of war since he was young; Saladin wasn't a good uncle as depicted in a movie but a tough warlord who didn't hesitate to kill POW's to incite fear amongst his enemies...The movie is basically a fairy tale based on some random facts and it wouldn't be bad if it stayed that way. But RS wanted to make it a historical movie instead of a medieval adventure; and if You try to tread on that territory Mr. Scott - well, historical movies are researched, objective and insightful and these are the things that movie is lacking.",Kingdom of Heaven

It is very difficult to follow and has practically no story line at all. Kingdom of Heaven and Alexander are pretty much the same movie - travel here and there killing people. What is the point? I still have not figured out the purpose of either of these movies - not entertaining, lacks a plot, the acting is ho-hum. Where is the historical significance? These types of movies are only speculation. The only good part of the movie was the end, when I got up and left! To sum it up - a total waste of time and money.

766,diane204,Point well-made,10,7 May 2005,"Usually I go to see a movie to be entertained. That's the only request I have for my $9. I prefer to sit down and spend 2 hours in a world that I know doesn't exist. I'm a 30-something mom with 2 kids and a life that I live pretty separate from the rest of the world. Not to say that I don't care what is happening in places like Sudan or Indonesia, but they are so far removed from my day-to-day duties that I don't dwell on them for longer than the evening news allows. Had you asked yesterday if a movie, a simple piece of entertainment, would change my view on anything that was actually important in life, I would probably have laughed at you. Today, I would not. Kingdom of Heaven speaks very subtly to the audience, but very desperately and very quietly to the heart and soul. I prefer not to list events and quotes from the movie, because I think you need to see the piece as a whole to really understand the importance of those actions and words. It is relevant, it is nagging, and neither of these is a bad thing. It is timely...the setting is long,long ago, it is also just yesterday.

767,help-7,Shallow script,4,1 May 2005,"Very unfortunate, but why such a big business so well shot with such a shallow script ? Why choose this crusade when the first would have been better. The script seems to have been written by an absolute beginner who knows not very much of scriptwriting. The central character is empty... Orlando Bloom is not playing convincingly Balian but mostly the script is not making any sense. I don't want to tell more and reveal the plot. Now, the battle scene are really well made and Eva Green is so cute. Really, why such a bad script which looks like a completely ungenuine quickly brushed up story with bits and pieces picked up here and there. The supporting characters are good and I advise to see the movie as some may like it but this work is a flat betrayal of the subject of the crusade, it doesn't have a viewpoint really. It's an illustration of some part of history more or less fancied. It is not boring, it's frustrating. Now Ridley Scott does a wonderful job but two big casting mistakes : William Monahan, the scribe and Orlando Bloom, the star. The crusaded should have received a much better treatment.",Kingdom of Heaven
768,Poodebah,It's a good movie. Keyword: MOVIE.,8,5 September 2007,"===MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD! BEWARE!=I've had it with these uptight people bashing this movie for not being 'historically accurate.' What a historical 'movie' of the crusades? Watch ""Crescent and the Cross"" or one of those. THEY AREN'T MAKING THIS FOR HISTORY CHANNEL! What's HILARIOUS, is some of these people try to bash THIS movie for historical inaccuracy, while proclaiming how much they LOVE Gladiator. THAT'S what I call laughable! If they made this movie with an unmasked, violent leper (Baldwin The Leper) and a balding, somewhat over-what hero (Balian of Ibelin), then NOBODY WOULD WATCH IT! It's meant to be a MOVIE, not a LESSON ABOUT THE CRUSADES.I've also had it with these people who bash the movie for being 'anti-Christian,' many of these people going on to say that the Christians were ""Already in Jerusalem forever and ever, since the world was turning! it was the MUSLIMS that took over Jerusalem!"" or ""Those barbaric Muslims with their fancy 'doctors' and 'plumbing' and 'BATHING' were just randomly out in the streets slitting the throats of Christians in the city! That's why Urban called for a crusade!"" In the words of Lex Luthor from the new Superman movie, ""WRONG!"" Christians sacked Jerusalem and MERCILESSLY KILLED TENS OF THOUSANDS. An act that STILL causes outrage amongst much of the Muslim community. Oh, but hey, if we ignore that, we can make the Christians seem like the heroic saviors, and the Muslims the bad guys! The real story is Byzantium wanted help against the Muslims, so they asked the Pope for support. The Pope disguised the Crusade as a ""Holy War"" and played on the fanaticism of Europeans. Rather effective, all things considered! Saladin had opportunities to kill Christians in cold blood. I think I only recall one account where he did so, and it was in response to RICHARD THE LIONHEART MERCILESSLY KILLING A LARGE BAND OF MUSLIMS. There's a REASON Saladin is counted as one of the ""pagans"" allowed into paradise in the Christian faith! I can agree that it was a bit odd that Balian, a blacksmith, suddenly became a masterful swordsman and tactician. However, what people don't seem to grasp in movies anymore, is subtle shifts in time. In one scene, we see a barren landscape that Balian rules. A few scenes later, there're crops growing. Obviously, there's been a LAPSE OF TIME. Perhaps he learned more in that time? OH NO. A MOVIE THAT MAKES US USE OUR SKILLS OF DEDUCTION?! HOW TERRIBLE! There are a few historical inaccuracies that annoyed me, but I'm not so high-and-mighty that I'm going to force myself not to enjoy the movie, just because it isn't like reading a text book about the time period it's based in.In closing; sit back, relax, loosen up, and enjoy the movie for what it is; a good movie that gets across a few historical ironies (Christian in 1000 AD-ish period: ""To kill an INFIDEL is not murder!"" Modern Muslim (as viewed by overly-zealous/patriotic Americans): ""To kill an INFIDEL is not murder!"") and controversial views.",Kingdom of Heaven
769,Stoogemobile_69,"Director's cut masterpiece, original version horrible",6,9 April 2008,"The original theatrical version of this film was terribly ruined by Ridley Scott himself. He had very little faith in the final cut being well received by American audiences and decided, along with the production team and financiers, to shorten the film by 45 minutes. Those 45 minutes of footage were brilliantly revived in the DVD Director's cut.This is possibly the worst mistake of Scott's career. I think Gladitor, Black Hawk Down and American Gangster are brilliant films, so I like Scott. I really do. I felt really let down the first time I saw the film. Orlando Bloom did not 'bloom' at all in his representation of Balian, the blacksmith turned saviour of Jerusalem. The plot did not go deep enough into the lives of Sibylla and Guy of Lusignan - the short lived king and queen of Jerusalem.The plot moves far too quickly and events seem to unfold without much pause for thought on why they are happening. Sibylla goes mad, gets depressed, cuts off her hair and goes into hiding all of a sudden. A subplot involving Sibylla's child in the Director's cut shows why this happens. You can see the self-hatred she feels when she realises the consequences of her manipulation. It elbourates on the situation of Balian's father in the French village and the animosity between himself and the Lord, which ties together beautifully with the attempted capture of Balian while he is traveling east with his father. You learn that the man who Balian kills at the start is his half-brother, jealous of Balian's inheritance.Those 45 minutes completely change the dynamics of the film. I cannot stress enough how much better the Director's cut is. I have never seen Alien, which many regard to be Scott's best film, so I cannot compare this to his other films. But I will say this: The Director's cut version of this film should have been the original. Damn to hell all preview audience opinion polls. I think the director's cut of this film is better than any other film of its genre. And that includes Gladiator.",Kingdom of Heaven
770,xrysostom,Historical Epics Should Mirror History,1,18 May 2005,"Ridley Scott seems more involved with producing a pro-Islamic postmodern apologetic than in delivering what purports itself to be a balanced, historical examination of the time of the Crusades.Not only does Scott save his actors the hassle of developing their characters, he gives the majority of them cartoonish versions of their historical counterparts with which to work.The majority of the Christians are self-absorbed, self-serving, self-righteous frauds out to rape, pillage, and build up their personal fortunes while the Muslims are put-upon and only resort to extreme measures because of the brutality of their foes. The movie ignores historic accounts of Muslim debasement of Christians and Jews. It doesn't jibe with Islam's own military excursions which wiped out thousands of Christians, destroyed churches founded by the apostle Paul and other first-generation believers, emasculated men, enslaved women, and shed more blood than did all of the Crusades together.Scott's stereotypes of Christians should offend anyone who truly believes in Jesus Christ while his portrayal of the Muslims ought to charm all who believe that the Qur'an is the world's only perfect piece of literature and the source of the planet's only true religion. I don't know where writer William Monahan learned his history, philosophy, or religion, but if his upcoming ""Tripoli"" is as historically inaccurate, the United States Marine Corps should stand ready to defend its song while Islamic apologists should prepare once again to stack the superlatives for one seemingly bent upon Extreme Muslim Makeover.Overall, I find his mathematician-turned-FBI-adviser TV series Numb3rs more believable (and more inspiring) than this piece of revisionistic junk.",Kingdom of Heaven
771,kukalakaz,I await the DVD!,7,10 May 2005,"Well... I have now seen the movie... which means it's time for my review: *fingers take a deep breath* Prepare for spoilers: I eagerly await the DVD. I thought the movie was good. Not great. But definitely good. I wish we had actually seen more of the siege played out... I don't believe that's going to happen on the DVD. But I do wish that.The editing was horrible. The cuts were choppy and abrupt in a number of places (i.e. the end of the siege, the exodus from Jerusalem) and I think it left some of the uninitiated feeling very confused.I also found a few plot points unbelievable. The shipwreck being chief among them. He AND the horse happen to survive? Riiiiiight. And that's all? Whatever. And I think the everyone in Jerusalem cheering Balian because he surrendered the city was a little off. I also wish that we had seen the bartering... Saladin didn't let everyone go for nothing, those lives were paid for with gold. Maybe not all, but many. And some were still sold into slavery.And I still find the Sibylla/Balian relationship unconvincing. They could have kept to the historical accuracy of Sibylla and Guy de Lusigan's happy marriage, but created political friction between Sibylla and Balian and it still would have worked for drama. And I think Sibylla would have been a much more interesting character. As I understand it... a lot of her dimensions end up in the DVD.So... now that I've whined about what I didn't like... what did I like? Alexander SIDDIG! Brilliant. His best role yet. He had intensity when he needed to and humor when he needed. It was perfection. I especially loved it when they were at Kerak. That was hilarious. I'm disappointed that they've changed the character's name to Nasir though. It means that even though Sid was important, he didn't even really have much of a backstory to build a character on. Even his name was changeable right up until the end! To still be able to do that much with it is really saying something about Sid as an actor.Still I liked that Sid's character was an homage to Imad ad-Din... even if he was a crappy writer.I also like David Thewlis' character quite a lot in the movie. I thought the Hospitaller provided the right amount of balance between the virtuous and the not-so-virtuous Christians. I like him a lot more than Remus Lupin.Ghassan Massoud was amazing as Saladin. I was really blown away. I now really want to know what Sid thought about this man and what he learned and how he worked with him because it was too men just doing it all through eye-contact, and they both have that quiet intensity and it just came off so natural, like they were meant to read each other's minds. Just amazing.Edward Norton was awesome. I see where people get that his performance was Brandoesque. It really was. He did a really good job with the role. I thought Jeremy Irons was just as good as well.And... Orlando Bloom was good too. Yeah... a little shaky at points (that speech at the end! yech!)... but overall I think he did pretty well. I thought he played the part exactly as it was meant to be played. Whether that's what people want to see is another question. But I thought he was good. I think it's his best role yet.The script... believe it or not, even with my gripes, I thought it was a good script overall. It had problems... definitely.But I think the movie said a lot of what needed to be said. Maybe it didn't take it far enough, I don't know. But it said exactly what I've been trying to say... Christians need to stop acting like a bunch of self-righteous pricks, and Muslims need to stop pointing at the past and make peace with it and the world. The time has come for that. I think that is what the movie says, and I think it says it beautifully in the last scenes with Saladin, especially the truce scene between Saladin and Balian.So... overall... thumbs up! Yay Sid!

After seeing it in cinema I was also disappointed, but the DVD more than made up for it, and I must say, this movie is one of the most sorely underestimated/misjudged movies; it is a Ridley Scott masterpiece. Director's cut is about 60 minutes extra, which gives the movie a lot more balance, depth, and credibility, which honest enough it badly needed.There are of course still things that can annoy a fan of the more 'serious' cinema, some cliché characterizations, some poor acting, some not very credible/over the top action scenes and courses of action.

It led the audience through the holy war in Jerusalem quite well and was quite historically accurate (being a Hollywood film). The best part I loved about this movie were the sides. Usually you have a good side versus a bad side which is shown quite annoying because anybody knows that there is good and bad on every side. Going off that remark, It was nice to have a sort of inner story of a man inside the outer story of the crusades so that I could actually feel like I was living in the movie itself. Take Orlando's character, granted he didn't play a real person, yet his life led us into moments that were very real and very powerful. It was just nice for a change in the film industry to have bittersweet moments that play with the mind, and ask the audience, ""Is Jerusalem really worth it"". That was in fact my favorite part of the film, that they actually gave it up, because in the end, Jerusalem was worth both ""nothing"" and ""everything"".

The story wastes no time in placing the audience at the centre of the action with sweeping camera work and large action sequences. A reasonable cast do their best creating tension and chemistry but this seems to fail with Bloom's character and Greens, the sexual tension relies heavily on Scott's visual talents and not the actors. The film being released at a time where audiences have been saturated with either historical or fantasy epics you would like to feel that Kingdom of Heaven may offer something new but unfortunately it does not. On the positive side Scott's offering is entertaining with dialogue not overbearing; and a score that varies in styles and absorbing enough to keep the world you're placed into comforting.

If we weren't in love with him before we are now, he's still beautiful to behold.

778,diggysfgiants,Kingdom of Heaven directed by Ridley Scott told the story of a French blacksmith named Balian who went to defend Jerusalem.,2,28 February 2013,"The main theme that rules the people of this time is their overwhelming commitment to religion. The people believe in above all else that God is shining on them and blessing their sides in battle. The Christians and Muslims pray to the same God, yet believe that God wants them to slaughter thousands of people of the other religion. So much blood is shed to justify there conquers. The religious interpret their holy texts to say what they want. By fighting for God, people of the time were able to rise in nobility for defending their religions.The entire crusades seems horrible and childish in retrospect, yet thousands of years later, this is still a problem. People of different religions are still killing each other in the Middle East in the name of God. This just shows how powerful religion can be over some people. Balian at one point has the very novel, 21st century idea that Jerusalem should have room to tolerate both religions. I think that this film plays on the religious conflicts that have never gone away and are in some ways just as heated today as they were in the 1100s. I do not think that the actual Balian would be as liberal and tolerant of different ideas and religions as was implied.The film had fantastic scenery and did a great job recreating the city of Jerusalem. The film showed beautiful architecture, and a diverse collection of people from around the world gathering in the city. Middle Easterners and Europeans mixed in this city, mostly to kill each other, but it was still interesting to see an interpretation of a global city at the time.The love story was not very believable to me. I do not think that over the matter of a month or so, Balian would be completely over his wife whom he came to Jerusalem to defend, and become romantically involved with Sybilla. By the way, Sybilla was married to the knight Guy. In the Christian religion I'm certain that this is a sin and they committed adultery and will go to hell for it. If we are to believe that these people are good Christians than they should try to keep their clothes on and their morals in check.This movie looked fantastic but was in my opinion not a very good movie in terms of content or acting. The lead actor Orlando Bloom who played Balian did not do a very good job convincing me that he was actually ever grieving over his wife. At most he seemed a bit upset. This movie reinforced why I think religion is pointless and destructive in nature. No one can truly interpret these holy texts that were written hundreds of years after these events were have to taken place. I do not believe that the Bible is a literal account, but more like a fable that is supposed to teach a larger lesson about being a good person, not a contract to go out and kill people that believe in other things. And the worst part of this film is that it was slow and very boring.",Kingdom of Heaven

782,perryg84,The extended DVD edition is far superior.,9,7 June 2006,"One thing is very certain, Ridley Scott knows how to make these kinds of films. This film really got the short end of the stick because it was released after the debacles of troy and Alexander and a slew of other historical action epics. Audiences didn't to waste their time to give a chance to another one.I personally feel in terms of subject matter this film is better than gladiator. Its thoughts and comments about religion as a whole are eye opening in relation to present day conflicts happening all over the world, particularly in terms of the middle east. Scott used this films time and setting to cleverly to express some of his views on some real key issues.Beyond the theme and setting, this is a very good film to look at. One of Scotts strengths as a filmmaker for sure. Of course it is entertaining, there are many action sequences and an awesome battle at the end. Keep an eye out to where Ed Norton is in this film.I have seen both versions of this film. The theatrical cut and the extended DVD edition. When I had first watched this movie I felt some parts were rather rushed and a lot of development (character or plot) seemed to be left out.With the directors cut Ridley Scott has added about an hour of footage to flesh out the film a lot more. Some relationships and characters which were non-existent in the theatrical version are seen in this one. I will not divulge any spoilers so one can see for themselves.If you have already have seen the this film in the theater I recommend taking the time to watch the directors cut, you'll feel a better sense of wholeness in this picture and a superior experience than the original version. If you missed the original cut of this film I recommend skipping the first version and definitely checking out the extended edition. I'll like to make it clear that the added footage is not just added in for the sake of it, the film benefits from it extraordinarily.If your looking for a big epic film to watch..check it these one it will not disappoint!",Kingdom of Heaven
783,crevette32,Excellent movie,9,3 May 2005,"Don't believe the commercials. This is not your typical sword and sandals type epic. This isn't just blood and guts and action and sweaty men rolling around armor.The movie opens in France where group of crusaders pass a burial at a village crossroads.Balian (Orlando Bloom) has lost everything. The burial was his young wife, who committed suicide after the death of their child. He's in such deep mourning that it seems as though he's barely aware of the world around him.Into this comes Godfrey of Ibelin (Liam Neeson). He's been searching for Balian--his illegitimate son--to ask for forgiveness and to offer to take him to the Holy Land.Balian at first numbly refuses but then commits a horrific crime and rides off after his father. His goal: In the Holy Land he can find redemption not only for his sins, but those of his wife. By his deeds, he can save her from Hell.Ambushed by men wanting to take Balian back to justice, Godfrey is mortally wounded but makes Balian a knight before he dies, passes his estate and title on. He also charges his son to ""be a good knight"", something Balian takes to heart.Travel with a Knight-Hospitaler (David Thewlis) and several plot advancements later he arrives in Jerusalem where he is charged by King Baldwin IV (Edward Norton) and Tiberus (Jeremy Irons) the Marshall to protect the road to Jerusalem for everyone.Guy DE Lusignan (Marton Csokas) and Reynald DE Chatillon (Brendan Gleeson) want war with the Muslims. God, after all is on their side. How can they lose? Their extremist counterparts on the Muslim side of the divide believe the same thing, because Allah is on their side. Baldwin and Saladin (Ghassan Massoud) have held a peace together by sheer strength of will, but Baldwin is dying of leprosy--his disfigurement is so profound he wears a silver mask at all times. And Guy is married to Balwin's sister, Sibylla (Eva Green). This means that Guy will be the next king. And that spells trouble.Into this Balian comes into his own as a knight who has embraced everything that a knight should be and become a man of great personal integrity. He is literally offered the kingdom, but turns it down because the moral price is too high. At what price peace? Is it enough to condone murder? Guy becomes King of Jerusalem, angers Saladin, and touches off a war that leads to the tragic Battle of Hattin and the siege of Jerusalem. Guy, in his stalwart belief that God's favor would make them the victors, left the city defenseless except for one knight--Balian.Balian must defend the city, not for the rocks and stones and holy places, but for the people who live there.This is is a deep, thoughtful movie full of sterling performances--and yes, I include Orlando Bloom in that statement.It's a complicated performance, this one. When Balian comes to Jerusalem, he goes straight to the hill where Christ was crucified and sits. And waits. The movie goes to complete silence while he waits. But nothing happens. He then tells the Hospitaller that God has stopped talking to him. God no longer hears him. He has lost his faith. The Hospitaller tells him that God is not about voices or praying, but how one acts and conducts himself. At the end of the day, you'll be a good man... or you won't.Balian evolves through the movie. For the first half of the movie events flow over and around Balian like a stream. Events move him, he doesn't move events. In a way, I didn't see him as the main character but more as a bystander to everything, and we were watching it happen through his eyes. He starts out so immersed in his own grief he can barely speak, but by the time he is called upon to defend the innocent people at Kerak he has become a force to be reckoned with.And so has Orlando Bloom. Some people might call the performance weak, but I'd call it nuanced and understated. And excellent. In fight scenes, he commands the screen. His intensity is amazing. Liam Neeson was amazing, as usual. He dies early in the movie, but I'd grown so attached to him that I wept. Jeremy Irons as Tiberious exudes the weariness that comes from fighting a losing battle for so long. Edward Norton does an amazing job with just his voice. You can never see his face except for the barest glimpse of his eyes but his voice evokes such sadness, weariness and hope.The weak link in the cast for me was Eva Green. Sibylla starts off as strong-willed woman, seduces Balian and offers him a kingdom. But then during the last half she easily turns over the crown to Guy, spends the siege hacking off her hair and ends up looking like one of those extremely frightening big-eyed, depressed waif paintings from an episode of ""Night Gallery"".Ridley Scott has done an amazing job with this movie. Visually rich and stunning, the costumes, armor and weapons are spot on for the time period. The attention to detail is outstanding. The battle scenes... well, there really aren't enough ways to say ""incredible"", are there? But the most important part of the movie isn't the fighting or the violence or the romance or any of that. The most important part and most recurring theme is redemption. Godfrey's redemption by finding his lost son and saving him. Balian's redemption not only of himself, but his dead wife. Sibylla's redemption in the end. And redemption isn't from words or prayers or chanting, but by actions.",Kingdom of Heaven
784,litogel,my opinion about Kingdom of Heaven,9,24 May 2005,"Had the movie been more accurate in historic content, I would have rated it a 10 but then again there is no such thing as a 10 so at my 9 it is the best movie I have ever seen so much so that I watched it three times in a span of a week and the third time was as god as the first, the second being the best. The story line is acceptable. Seeing the leper king, Baldwin IV the first time was a shock. Can this be true, can there be such a King of Jerusalem? Upon researching the historical accounts, I was aghast that it was indeed true, he existed, was king from age 16 to when he died at 24 and he did defeat Salahadin or Saladin earlier. This is certainly a tour De force never seen before in any movie and should be one of the many badges of merit for Mr. Ridley Scott. The casting is about the best as it can be. Mr Bloom has redeemed himself from his very anemic Paris in Troy. Just looking at Eva Green elates and what an entrance scene galloping into Balian's home. The action is superb and not exaggerated. The message about what Jerusalem means in world history and politics is excellently presented. The siege is very good and may be comapared to that siege in the Ingrid Bergman ""Joan of Arc"" of the early 1950s. My thanks to those who made this wonderful movie.",Kingdom of Heaven
785,deathblooms7012,Must watch extended version,9,30 November 2012,"My first watch though this movie, I didn't think to much of it, maybe a 6/10. The producers cut out a lot of important material.(Poor Ridley Scott) Much of the movie did not make sense. I didn't understand what was going on or why the battle's important. Orlando Bloom did very well as we can all expect.After watching the movie for a second time, although this time extended director's cut, I must say this movie blew me away. The producers cut out 50 minutes worth of great material. If you're going to watch this movie, watch the extended version. The movie makes much more sense, connection to characters bring a real feeling. When we first see Balian de Ibelins father (Liam Nelson) I (we) had mixed feelings. Great acting between Orlando bloom and Liam Nelson build the beginning, giving us ties to our main character. We find importance in this new found leader. Moving through the story understanding his part and just actions. Story is well told, Sabylia does perfect. Great eye candy as well as acting to the story. Sex scene, though not really one, is added to in this version. Nothing to explicit. Watching our hero Balian de Ibelin (Orlando Bloom) rising from the black smith to the hero of Jurisila was quite the journey that I very much enjoyed. Each scene is well thought out and adds to this movie. Every character, however small, is well played and gives us a real feel for the time. Please watch this extended version, breath taking in my opinion. Theatrical cut 6/10 extended 10/10. Therefor i give an 8. -Rise a knight-",Kingdom of Heaven

However, it still delivers an extraordinary story while trying to incorporate some historical significance in the process. The knockout performance in the movie goes to Ghassan Massoud who played the part of Saladin. His commanding performance as the merciless yet reasonable king deserves accolades and is a definite must see. Overall this movie incorporates well-seasoned actors with a great directing style, at the same time this particular genre is becoming a bit overdone. I definitely recommend watching the movie and perhaps adding it to your DVD collection.",Kingdom of Heaven

789,starrytrekchic,The only movie I've ever walked out on in a theater,1,28 June 2006,"Believe me, I've stopped watching movies part way through before...but never in a theater. There's always the hope that the movie will eventually be worth my money. However, this particular movie was the exception.I walked out at the two hour mark. I don't do a lot with my life, but I knew I could find a better way to spend that last half hour than staring stupidly at the movie screen as my brains slowly dribbled out of my ears. I think I ate ice cream instead. Time well spent. To this day I have no idea how the movie ended, and I have not a shred of curiosity about the subject. I'm only writing this in the hopes of saving a few people a few dollars.So what is wrong with this movie? It never inspires anything but apathy. I did not care what happened to the characters, the plot, any of it. I had a vague desire to see everyone die, just because they were that uninteresting. The majority of the main characters were miscast and completely unbelievable in their roles. The plot was tedious and stupid. I could go on, but the mere memory of the movie makes my brain turn into mush.Understand that I'm coming at this film from a history perspective....I love history, I love Middle Eastern history especially, I even have degrees in these fields, but even my interest in the subject could not overcome the horrendously insipid nature of this film. It's not the subject matter, but simply the movie's failure to captivate the audience and its complete lack of brains that makes this movie unwatchable.",Kingdom of Heaven
790,brawlagent,an egregious disappointment,4,17 May 2005,"A point of bewilderment: how is the first page of comments on this film filled by nothing but praise? Whereas, admittedly, the scenery is pretty, the scene itself is a monstrosity, whose ability to find get produced leaves me somewhat chapfallen. All of the characters were horridly underdeveloped, notably the handsomely cheekboned Balian, who appears from nowhere as the bastard son with a noble father, who out of goodness decides to name his son as the inheritor of a sizeable estate and a small regiment. But who is Balian? The first half-hour of the movie is an excruciating attempt at character development, and we are given a portrait of Balian, a soft-spoken bastard with no place in society. His wife committed suicide, he kills a priest. But apart from these anecdotal facts we receive no insight into the hero's mind or heart, and over the course of the movie he seems nothing but a dogmatic actor of his father's doctrine--help the poor. Does he have a particular reason to help the helpless? Do we have any indication to what might fuel the fiery flame within his heart to make him stand to the death for a city to which he has no real connections? None. The dialogue is as well deplorable, but perhaps the greatest, most egregious failure of the movie lies in its plot.The plot is nothing but a copy of various epic-level movies that have appeared, but most noticeably it was a copy of one of the subplots of the Lord of the Rings: the story of Aragorn. Consider the similarities: outcast king inherits a kingdom, a siege conducted on a well-protected fortress, a shortage of soldiers and a call to arm every man in order to protect the masses, even a relocation in the end. Except in the Lord of the Rings this was all much more deftly developed, and one could actually care about the character.The turning point of the movie--Balian's rejection of the throne--is nothing short of ridiculous. Is it not clear to every audience member what the consequences of Guy's ascension are? Is it not clear to Balian himself? And yet he is, inexplicably, concerned here with the state of his own soul, despite the inscription at his original smith, despite the oath forced upon him by his father, despite his own words to the leper-king, etc. Why does he reject the throne? In order to provide the plot a way to enthrone Guy and start the catastrophic action.The pacing is pathetic, the plot clumsily picked from its predecessors, its characters cardboard or wholly unconvincing. At least the scenery, every once in a while, is pretty.",Kingdom of Heaven

Several people left the theater during the movie. Unlike my wife I was able to stay till the end. In the end it suggested that the Kingdom of Heaven is somewhere near Jerusalem.

It is, perhaps, not necessarily what you expect going in, but that turns out to be wonderful in ""Kingdom of Heaven.""This unexpected quality of the story gives 'Kingdom of Heaven' the makings of a timeless classic in the realm of movie-making because it demands an engaged audience, provokes thought and offers something new with each viewing.",Kingdom of Heaven

This movie was just VERY uneventful and the best actor casted (Liam Neeson) is dead within the first 30 minutes. I have do admit, Ghassan Massoud gave a notable performance as well, but Orlando Bloom should never be in a lead role (I even heard Ridley Scott tried everything to NOT have him as the lead, but that's just a rumor right now).Overall, this was a huge disappointment and I think Ridley Scott can do much better.

795,mllebondgirl007,All in all it should be seen,6,9 June 2005,"Being a huge Ridley Scott fan I just had to see this film. I did run across a comment he made and here's the quote""Bloom's character in Kingdom of Heaven is an agnostic, just like me. I am not fighting another holy war here, I am trying to get across the fact that not everyone in the West is a good guy, and not all Muslims are bad. The tragedy is that we still have a lack of understanding between us, and it is 900 years since the crusades. We have never truly resolved our differences.""That part I definitely got by watching the film and I respect him for having done that. The movie showed a different perspective and it can almost be seen as a political statement and for that I recommend seeing it. But a good movie needs to me more than a political statement, a good documentary could have gotten the point across. However his next quote...""Audiences are less intrigued, honestly, by battle. They're more intrigued by human relations. If you're making a film about the trappings of the period, and you're forgetting that human relationships are the most engaging part of the storytelling process, then you're in trouble.""Hello!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ridley hit the nail on the head, The entire movie was a long drawn out battle scene, this is exactly what went wrong in the film. What human relationship? There was not one truly memorable relationship, at least not fully developed.He must be referring to the father and son relationship between Orlando Bloom and Liam Neeson which failed miserably to impress us. I cannot blame the actors, I must blame the script for this one. I'm slightly disappointed by this film, I fell in love with Ridley Scott many years ago because of the legacy of strong female characters he exhibited in his movies (Daryl Hanna's character in Blade Runner, Alien, Thelma and Louise, and more recently G.I Jane, matchstick men) I think him being in touch with his feminine side has always been his biggest asset, Maybe he needs a muse. Don't' get me wrong, it's a beautiful film, Extremely titillating for the eyes but you walk out without having climaxed. Hoping his next film will make me forget. Denise",Kingdom of Heaven
796,BrianBergh,No big pitched battle!!!! boring :-),8,8 May 2005,"OK, great visuals on the movie, but when Mr. Ridley already have changed the history so much, then why did he not give me a BIG pitched battle like the big battle in Braveheart?

797,Cang,Kingdom of Heaven: In pursuit of perfection,9,27 October 2005,"In essence, a knight participating in a crusade was in the process of penitence, in a noble quest for reaching God and perfect enlightenment. In other words, he was in pursuit of perfection. However, even the best intentions can produce questionable results due to a number of reasons. In this aspect at least, ""Kingdom of Heaven"" seems to follow a similar pattern.And since historical accuracy seems to be an essential requirement in this kind of movies, it can be said from the very start: ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is , more or less, historically accurate. Sure, there are a few occasions in which poetic license has taken an extra step, but generally speaking there aren't many, neither they are crucial. Technically, the movie is outstanding. Costumes, sets, props, make-up are all of very high standards and convey the proper message. Photography is also very good, however, some scenes do look somehow empty and some desert takes look a bit stagy. The music, although not as imposing as in other similar movies (e.g. ""Gladiator""), serves the film and gives a proper rhythm. The reasons for which this film, although good, will not be a classic, must be sought in other areas.Continuing the unavoidable comparison with ""Gladiator"", Sir Ridley's previous work of the same style, what ""Kingdom of Heaven"" lacks terribly is depth in the relations between characters, as much as depth in the characters themselves. In some occasions it almost reaches the desired point, but unfortunately it's only a scratch on the surface. Orlando Bloom is giving a decent performance, quite laconic and to the point, which is an important step forward considering his previous roles. The rest of the cast also have good moments, but they seem lost and without cohesion. The editing has done much harm to the film, since it is plainly obvious that there are, in essence, scenes missing. Had this film been closer to the duration threshold of 3 hours, things might have been better.In conclusion, ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is not a bad film and can guarantee 2+ hours of good entertainment. But from Sir Ridley Scott we expect much more than merely that, and one can't help feeling slightly disappointed watching this film. It feels as a golden opportunity for a real classic, which was unfortunately lost",Kingdom of Heaven
798,pmika-1,"Visually Spectacular, uninspiring protagonist (Bloom), disjunct narrative, thought provoking",6,8 May 2005,"The question of whether the aesthetic value of a work can be marred by it's moral message is important to keep in mind when reading my critique. I think it's quite obvious that works of art that overall (I'm not talking about individual characters or even the narrator's particular world view as portrayed by the movie, but the overall slant the movie has towards a particular world view) espouse a world view contrary to what we think is right or true, will lessen the overall appeal of the work. One example of this would be Leni Riefenstahl's, Triumph of the Will, which despite its cinematic beauty, is for many a morally repugnant film, given it's clearly unrealistic pro-Hitler slant that greatly hid the truth of the Nazi regime. Now getting back to Kingdom of Heaven, I am by no means saying Kingdom of Heaven is on the same level of moral repugnance as triumph of the will, but like Fahrenheit 911, for example, it cunningly uses a series of particular historical events to create a fictional history that backs up a particular world view, namely, in the case of Kingdom Of Heaven, enlightenment humanism.Enlightment Humanism is defined by the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy as ""Enlightenment humanism which is closest to the sense that commonly attach's today to the terms 'secular' or 'scientific' humanism"" as well as ""For these thinkers, human dignity was not a function of man's allegedly divine origin, but of the ordering and rational possibilities of earthly existence. The end of persons is neither the immediate adoration of God nor the heavenly city of the blessed, but rather the realization of those projects appropriate to this world, suggested by both reason and imagination."" This description of humanism fits exactly the view that Ridley Scott advocates in his film. I will now cite some examples to back up my claim that Scott's film through careful selection of historical events, shows humanism in a good light and in turn also vilifies, indirectly organized religion by showing it in a completely bad light. In the very beginning of the movie the protagonist Bloom/Balian's wife commits suicide, and the priest dealing her with remains, steals the cross from the dead woman's neck. Now at this time in the movie, Bloom's long lost father, a crusader knight, happens to arrive looking for his son to take him back to the Holy Land with him. The priest aware of this, attempts to goad Bloom into leaving the town, saying he is not wanted there, and that his wife is in hell, and that he might redeem her in Jerusalem. The point is Blooms spots his dead wife's cross on the priest's neck and then in a fit of rage murders him. So aside from portraying the first religious figure in the movie as a despicable grave robber, Ridley Scott also gives us a hero who from the beginning has murdered a priest for completely unjustified reasons. Finally Scott portray's the bishop in Jerusalem as going along with the war mongering of certain knights, and in the end as coward who would give up his faith instantly when he felt his life was in peril, stating ""convert now, repent later"", referring to the point at which Saladin's Army was about to take Jerusalem. I'm not stating that the medieval catholic church didn't have some despicable priests who advocated some horrible things, but a few bad apples does not make the whole barrel bad and for Scott to portray the church in such a negative light I think is an injustice and historically inaccurate. Scott's movie takes place some time after the first crusade so there is no direct explanation offered for why the crusade was called. Instead, through his portrayal of organized religion as in bed with knights lustful for war and booty he implicitly leads the audience to believe that the crusades as nothing more then a war driven by desire for power and territory. If you read history though you'll realize though that for years prior to the first crusade Muslim Turkish invaders were conquering more and more land inhabited by Christian's descended from those people of the Roman Empire. So lands of Egypt, Palestine, etc all used to be populated by Christian's prior to Turkish invasion and were not allowed as much freedom of religion as one would think, often being forced to pay special taxes, and not being allowed to propagate their faith. That said I do I find some aspects of his movie very much in keeping with the reality of the situation on the ground. While the church had large scale influence it didn't have direct control over those it commanded, so of course this left open the possibility of knight's with ulterior motives of power and booty to fight infidels in the name of religion and often cause more harm then good. To Ridley Scott then in this movie, organized religion is a sham, an empty shell, that knight's used to motivate others to commit terrible acts in the name of acquiring more power. Ridley Scott offers up the alternative of humanism as the answer as shown through the protagonist Bloom. This viewpoint only holds though if one agrees that organized religion is an empty sham which I don't. I think that yes, there were and are many power I suppose who only look religious, but in reality are not, but at the same time I think there were plenty of crusaders who were motivated by purely religious reasons to fight. While not historically accurate, at least in so far that you had modern humanist viewpoints placed within a 12th century medieval world, the film does bring out issues that have relevancy in our modern world. While I disagree with Scott's false biased portrayal of religion, some of the values espoused by this film such as tolerance are admirable.",Kingdom of Heaven

The way the film was shot made it gripping and realistic, the action scenes have been filmed in a way that makes the audience feel incorporated into the actual film. The film shows an ability for the audience 2 empathise with both sides of the conflict, it is a very complex story of heartache, war and relationships. over all i think this film has got to be one of the best released this year and should be watched by people who like historical movies esp when they are filmed in a slight docudrama style.",Kingdom of Heaven
800,gdwork,It didn't bloom,6,12 May 2005,"This film mostly focused on why Bloom's character does things, not what he actually does. An unexpectedly admirable goal, but not one which his performance was strong enough to carry.There was something uninspired about his performance, like he had a casual disinterest in the role or was wondering whether he left the gas on in his trailer. I think he has it in him to perform far better. Perhaps he is sick of playing Blacksmiths turned do-gooder.Anyway, I feel the focus on his motivations is not what people go in there expecting and once they find out that's what they are getting they are sure to be disappointed.As great as the battle scenes and cinematography are, they are not good enough to warrant watching Balian 'develop' for over an hour. If you want battle scenes save you money and watch Return of the King again.That being said, the interest is provided by great minor characters: David Thewlis, Ghassan Massoud as Saladin, and Norton's King Baldwin provided some depth to the story and its messages.

Who really wants to watch a documentary about the Crusades?I loved this movie and thought the cast and acting were fantastic. The settings and battle scenes were great. The faces of the actors had such interest that they competed with the exotic locale. No nation is all good or all bad. We as individuals make decisions on our role in this world and what we want to add or take from it. Many times we use religion as an excuse for our actions.

It was Orlando Bloom's character that didn't appeal to me, I don't know, I saw him as too young, too ""weak"" - next to Neeson, Irons, Csokas... And I saw Eva Green and I said, of course, the femme fatale who falls in love with the hero etc. But I felt I wanted more, that it could be more (besides the historical inaccuracy, but we know movies are movies and not documentaries). Then I found on DVD the director's cut. I came, I saw and the movie conquered me. Much much better than the theatrical release! Deeper, touching - the story regarding Sybilla's character -. One can understand much better and feel how good and evil can be as manipulable and close that you cannot see (or don't want to see) the difference.And really really amazing the job of Edward Norton (I first watched the movie dubbed in Spanish and didn't know who he was, but then his original voice and his eyes.. it hit me) and Ghassan Massoud (who I think couldn't speak English at all at the time of the movie).Great job on Ridley to cast Muslim actors for Muslim characters.although is full of common places that are so typical in historical movies (from Ben Hur to this one) you can see how enthusiast the actors, director, costume designer, the soundtrack composer, artistic director, photographer etc must have been making this movie.

807,nlayli,Okay movie but had potential to be better,6,14 May 2005,"I just saw Kingdom of Heaven last night and overall it was okay. The battle/war scenes were spectacular and so were the special effects. As for the development of the relationship between Balian and his father it was seriously lacking. For someone who just found out who their father was, Balian was too quick to decide to go off to Jerusalem with him, and he should have shown some shock, anger, or something at least. Also, Godfrey knights Balian and entrusts him with the responsibility of leading his army and protecting Jerusalem. The entire process happens way too quickly and what makes it worse is Orlando (Balian)says very little and all he does is stare. The dialogue between the two characters was emotionless and choppy. The ""romance"" between Sibylla and Balian was useless, it was poorly developed and very short. I personally felt it didn't add depth to the story and it was unbelievable, because of this when I watched it, it looked as if they had an instant physical attraction which lead to them having sex. The scenes between the two characters were too short and there wasn't any meaningful dialogue that would show the natural progression of their relationship. So in my opinion the producer shouldn't even have bothered putting a romance into the story-I think I would have liked it more. Overall, I liked the portrayal of the Muslims, they actually seemed more compassionate and reasonable than Guy de Lusignan and his army. They did a fair job in showing the rationalisation for violence in the name of God.Orlando's character needed much more dialogue and more emotion in his voice and facial expressions, there were times in the film were I was desperate to hear Balian react to what another character had said to him but instead he either said nothing or said one word. Other characters in the film were amazing, and like I said before the action scenes were great, but I left the movie wanting more maybe it was because I saw such major flaws in the development of the relationships or because Balian always said very little and showed little excitement. Since Orlando was the main character it was his responsibility to carry the movie, and he did a great job with the physical portrayal but the emotional aspect of Balian was kind of lacking. Part of the problem may have been the editing which made some scenes look really choppy, but if Orlando showed more emotion and had more to say I think this movie would have been really good.",Kingdom of Heaven

Everyone has tried to compare it to other epics such as Braveheart and Gladiator, but Kingdom of Heaven is not the story of how one man changed the world, but rather how one man dealt with the world changing around him. Jerusalem, when our story begins, is at the tenuous end of peace. The things that emerged from the movie were the gradual disintegration of goodwill and tolerance in the face of fanaticism and violence. The main character, Balian, isn't our ""hero"" but rather our window into that time, into that turbulent world. The battles scenes did what battle scenes are meant to do in war movies, and that is to show the horror, uselessness and futility of violence. There is a naked brutality in the war where people do not fight for survival, but simply greed disguised as ideology. The back story, since it was fictionalized, I felt could have been little less forced and awkward. Balian was a mild, humble man, and having him commit the crime he does in the beginning isn't set up well enough to make it believable. Also, the attack in the forest is poorly framed and reasoned. I have no issues with the way it was shot, but the way the script rationalized that part was odd. And the shipwreck... surreal. To Orlando's credit, from the first moment I set eyes on him he ceased to be Orlando Bloom and became Balian, though roughly sketched in terms of characterization. Do not misunderstand, I do love his character, but his motivations and his convictions seem a bit muddled at times, and that is not the fault of the actor, but rather the script writer.The most powerful performances for me were Saladin, Baldwin and Tiberius. Saladin as the compassionate but wronged king drew that fine line between being an idealist, and being a pragmatist. He showed mercy until he could no longer show it without hurting his own people. His character was beautifully written and also sympathetically portrayed by Ghassan Massoud. Baldwin... the scene where he beats Reynald and then collapses was perhaps the strongest scene in the movie for me. It visually presented the ideological handicap of these two great kings. They were noble and compassionate but lacked the brute strength to squash their opposition, the fundamentalists who slowly began eroding their power from within (similar to how Baldwin's leprosy eroded his face and body). Edward Norton emoted so precisely with only gestures and voice, awe-inspiring. There are rumors that he only lent his voice, but whatever the case, his performance was stunning and so evocative. He expressed that pain that all idealistic leaders express of knowing that they cannot maintain the peace that they have created. Tiberius, a subtle and cynical character was very well portrayed by Jeremy Irons. The absolute defeat that crosses his face when the Templar knights drown out his anti-war argument with protests of blasphemy is crushing. It makes you wonder what tolerance and peace can do in the face of such beliefs, such blind hatred and fundamentalism.Balian's character definitely shines better in places where he has to react to someone else's ideology. His faith in 'right action' becomes more apparent in those scenes then anywhere else. As the movie is written, it is very hard to showcase Balian beside other 'heros' because he is not fighting his own battle. As he himself says in the movie, they only fight in a battle in which the wounds have been inflicted a hundred years prior. It is extremely hard to get people to identify with that type of character, but I think Orlando did an admirable job. Sybilla was well played, but I have a feeling a lot of her character development, as well as the development of Balian and Sybilla's romance fell to the cutting room floor. The few moments they had however were very powerful. Sybilla's need for true companionship, as opposed to being a possession or a title, is so apparent when she says, ""I am not here because I am bored, or wicked."" Their romance has an inevitable yet incomplete quality to it, as if they both were reluctant and lost in their own worlds to really allow each other inside. Eva Green is beautiful and delivers the few emotional scenes she has very well. The best are when she speaks to her brother, and then sees the state of her husband and her city.Okay, so music was good, unobtrusive, and predictably exotic. My only qualm is it reminded me a LOT of Black Hawk Down. Not a problem since I loved that soundtrack, but still it kept me mentally connecting the scene to Somalia and the 1990s... not good. The visuals were stunning. Stunning. Each frame is like poetry, and I mourn to think of all that they shot that they left out of the movie. Editing was a bit choppy and you could kind of tell when bits were removed because of the lack of a good transition. Scripting, as I mentioned earlier has some strong moments and some weak ones. The beginning especially could use a lot of trimming. But the cinematography was brilliant, from the Moorish courtyards to the 'French' forests to the deserts. The atmosphere created in some of the scenes is so Middle Eastern and that is such a rare treasure in Hollywood (or Western) cinema. But in conclusion, definitely worth watching, perhaps even multiple times, for the visuals, for the acting and for the ultimate message. Tolerance.",Kingdom of Heaven

First movie looks great, you will have great time watching landscape and enjoying music. There is also good actors like Liam Neelson and Edward Norton as king.(quite surprising) Orlando Bloom sucks.

While I enjoyed Kingdom of Heaven very much, it is not on the same level as Gladiator or ""LOTR The Return of the King."" The scenery and battle scenes were excellent, and the equal portrayal of both sides were second to none. Jeremy Irons as Tiberias, and Liam Neeson as Godfrey were exceptional, playing non-traditional crusaders. Orlando Bloom fit the role of Balian very well, he actually seemed at home in armor carrying a sword (unlike Colin Farrell in Alexander). Where this film fell short of Gladiator is with character development, I simply did not care about Balian enough, or any of the characters for that matter. The battle scenes were epic in nature, without the highlighted 1 on 1 fights in the middle of battles like in Troy. Kingdom of Heaven is worth the price of admission, it blows other historical war movies like Alexander and King Arthur, but still falls short of Gladiator and Return of the King. 7 out of 10.",Kingdom of Heaven

I love that movie and critics and most people hated it! I do wish though if they continue with historic epics to choose various times and people. I'm glad to hear of this Cortez movie. Also I hope the next phase of movie themes is to convert Anne rice's vampire chronicles. They are time period sagas with rich history!!!!! I like the way Alexander showed some glimpses into cultures most movies don't, like India and Eurasia. That was lovely. India has a splendid rich culture. I'm so tired of the whole Romanesque movies.

812,yesjohnny,Lackluster Performance: Political Correctness at its finest,4,9 May 2005,"I don't want to offend, but it is my opinion that this movie was simply one more Hollywood epic gone wrong. Being one who studies medieval history I thought this could be a delight, and by no means was this movie devoid of redeeming qualities. Unfortunately, I thought this was just one more ecumenical push from Hollywood that made the movie a flop (not to mention the script was a trifle weak, and very little was explained). How can Hollywood continue to package these historical movies without any true understanding of the times and the beliefs of the people involved. Are we to believe that frankly no one believed in what they were fighting for during the crusades? Do people simply pretend to be religious? Those in Hollywood seem to fancy weaving fanciful stories with little historical consistency. Does it bother them that some of us are Christian, Muslim, or Jewish? Unfortunately, often times religious beliefs have clashed throughout history, but they all have their own inherent beauty. We should celebrate diversity, rather than delete it like some file on a computer. This is cultural relativism, and political correctness at its best. I guess it's too bad that we can't all be so ignorant, or arrogant for that matter.Orlando Bloom--He did as well as he could for the lines he had been given.",Kingdom of Heaven
813,amarvich06,"Beautifully made, yet the story has no compulsion...",8,8 May 2005,"I got out of school to see this movie on Friday (lol), and I must admit, it was much better than I expected it to be. This one should really break the ice for the recently-stereotypical ""bad"" tent pole film genre. And here's why: Ridley Scott pumps out another fantastically directed movie, everywhere from cinematography, action, blood, romance, and especially acting. Yes, the cinematography was wonderful, the action was real, but the acting... WWWWWWWWWOOOOOOOWWWWWWW. I hate Orlando Bloom. I hate him with a passion. But this movie did wonders for his image. Honestly, he does very, very good, but you'll have to see the movie to believe me. Liam Neeson, Brendan Gleeson, David Thewlis, Edward Norton - all fantastic.Also, the musical score was pretty good. However, I think that if they stuck with Hans Zimmer as was originally planned, it would have been better.I mentioned earlier that the story could've used some work. The story seemed very rushed, as though it should take place over the course of a decade or longer, not a few months. Also, the ending left now impact on me. It had very little of an emotional pull on me.That having been said, I found this movie to be neck-and-neck with Troy, which I honestly didn't think was bad at all. However, with Troy, the first time I saw it, I really didn't like it. Now I love it, and I expect the same from Kingdom of Heaven.Bottom line: Go see it; it's worth seeing at least once.",Kingdom of Heaven
814,Mr_Christian,Orlando Bland fails to save Scott's distorted vision,4,13 June 2007,"Kingdom of Heaven will almost certainly be used in future school classrooms and University lecture theatres as a practical learning tool; not by medievalists however, but by cultural and social historians. Why? Because this film screams its post-9/11 credentials from the opening shots and sustains them right through to the closing credits.Put bluntly, this film is historically misleading and unashamedly anachronistic. It pompously and misguidedly projects modern notions of multicultural harmony and religious tolerance onto a period where these concepts simply did not exist. Ridley Scott has succumbed to revisionism of the worst kind; Saladin and the Muslims are culturally sophisticated, admirably pious, eminently tolerant and seemingly only violent in response to unchecked Christian aggression. On the other hand, the crusaders are portrayed as knuckle-dragging pantomime bad guys, driven by colonial land-hunger, a barbaric desire for glory in battle and the more mundane and capitalist craving for wealth (Orlando Bloom and Jeremy Irons' characters being the notable exceptions).Rather than acknowledging the devotional fervour within Christendom that actually inspired the crusading movement, Scott discards this intrinsic aspect of crusade history as a thinly-veiled excuse for Western proto-imperialism. Indeed, the only members of the cloth featured in the film are weaklings in the thrall of brutal aristocrats, cowards willing to risk eternal damnation by apostatizing themselves in exchange for their own lives, or fanatics so Hell-bent on Holy War that they would acquiesce to a conflict wildly at odds with contemporary Augustinian notions of just war.Yet despite all these glaring (and frankly stomach-churning) faults, it could still have succeeded as a modern day epic, a la Spartacus - even with Bloom's ludicrous and near-instant transformation from lowly village blacksmith to Shakespearean warrior king. However, the film fails even as a spectacle  there is no historical context given to the audience so they invest nothing in the characters on screen. Far too much time is spent examining the fortune cookie morality of Bloom's character and the contrived meeting of minds he has with Alexander Siddig's equally reconstructed Muslim counterpart. An example of the incoherence that afflicts this film is the very plot device that transports Bloom to the Holy Land - the sole purpose of Balian's marathon journey from France to Jerusalem is to save his wife's soul from Hell. Yet this redemptive theme is never adequately resolved, since his woefully depicted inner torment is set aside in favour of inserting him improbably to the centre of the internecine quarrels troubling the crusader state.To be fair, the lavish recreation of medieval Jerusalem is impressive and some of the battle sequences are worthy of merit. But even a beguiling Edward Norton cannot salvage this ultimately unsatisfying effort at rewriting history to suit Scott's world view.",Kingdom of Heaven
815,danrobjack,The Director's Cut is a far superior film,9,7 December 2019,"I just wanted to let people know if you are going to watch this film then I would recommend you watch the Director's Cut. I would give the Theatrical Release (2 hours 24 minutes) a 7/10, but the Director's Cut (3 hours 14 minutes) gets a 9/10. The Director's Cut has an additional 50 minutes of footage which give the story much needed depth with a lot more context making Kingdom of Heaven a more cohesive and epic movie that I was completely engaged with, it's the film that should have been released in theaters. The Theatrical Release (while still beautifully filmed with great fight/battle sequences) just comes off very dull with not enough depth or context to the story or characters. The choice is entirely up to you, but I was just honestly shocked how much better the Director's Cut was.",Kingdom of Heaven
816,pothos6566,A Complicated Masterpiece,9,11 May 2005,"Sir Ridley Scott has made a movie that does not fit easily in today's Hollywood where the dollar is king. This is a complicated masterpiece full of Scott's signature imagery of magnificent landscapes and breathtaking battle scenes. Orlando Bloom does wonders with a role that is more complex than Russell Crowe's in Galdiator and Liam Neeson, Jeramy Irons and Ghassan Massoud bring immense power to their parts. Alexander Siddig once again proves that he is quietly emerging into one of the most gifted actors of recent years, with a role that displays both elegance and intellect. It is of note that considering his lower profile he grabs your attention throughout the action. Ed Norton does likewise in a role that commands your respect, in a part that must have been physically and mentally demanding. In an age where tolerance is considered a redundant concept, this is a courageous attempt to at least grab your attention and make you think beyond your comfort zone. I wish the longer version had been released on screen as the major problem stems from the obvious editing down from the original vision. However despite this minor fault, this film is a success. A movie that asks you to engage your brain is never a failure.",Kingdom of Heaven

818,FiddyGiddy,"humanity, tolerance vs. religious fanaticism, and finally, the motif of the ideal knight who won't sacrifice his morality.",9,9 October 2005,"I believe this is one of the best films I saw in the past year, even though it didn't do as well here in the U.S. compared to Europe. In my opinion if you like Braveheart, Kingdom of Heaven at its core has the same heart and soul. However, ff you typically do not like epic films, then you will get bored with Kingdom of Heaven.This film deals entirely with humanity, tolerance vs. religious fanaticism, and finally, the motif of the ideal knight who won't sacrifice his morality.The film seeks a higher purpose besides glorifying one side over the other. The movie is not about who's right and who's wrong, and who's evil and who's good. It was never meant for its audience to go in and start rooting for the crusaders to get ""them bad Muslim evildoers."" Instead it asks you, as the name implies, ""What is a Kingdom of Heaven?"" The cinematography was beautiful and the script artfully crafted. Granted Hollywood as always, takes a few liberties with the special effects and the historical characters; they do it in such a way as to add to the overall story. I believe the speeches made my Liam Neesan and David Thewlis are incredibly inspiring. The film does a wonderful job in trying to illustrate how Balian seeks to become the perfect knight of medieval literature. As he wins the affection of the people and the respect of his peers he is faced with a choice of whether he will sacrifice his morality for all of the things he has always wanted. However, like Sir Gawain in Le Morte D'Arthur , he sacrifices everything except his morals, and by definition becomes the ideal knight.Another fascinating aspect of the film is the fact that it is based on a historical event, as well as the characterization all of the predominant characters. If you are interested in learning more about their history, the supplemental feature disk includes a couple of A&E episodes if you're not interested in doing the research yourself.My only criticisms of this film is that the battle scenes drag, Queen Sibylla can be quite irritating, and that there is not enough humor that a film like this needs to divert attention from the pressing emotions and moral dilemmas it elicits.If you are interested in a simplistic plot where everything is black and white, or if you care more about special effects rather than contemplating an issue that has been around for hundreds of years and is still very much an issue in today's society, then you should pass on this film. However, if you are a lover of the humanities, movies like Braveheart, or British actors, then I highly recommend this film.",Kingdom of Heaven
819,mozartfan7,Good for some laughs and morbid satisfaction,1,7 May 2005,"As Gladiator is a favorite movie of mine, this film seemed moderately promising. Within the first moments however, I realized this film is about only two things, maximizing screen time for Orlando Bloom in his failed attempt at rugged handsomeness, and random intersperses of absurdly violent battle scenes, most akin to Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bills. If you are squeamish, do not see this movie. One of the most important aspects of any epic film is the dialogue, the kind that becomes instantly engraved in your memory. In Braveheart, it was ""Freedom"", in Gladiator, ""What we do in life echoes in eternity"". In Kingdom of Heaven...I really couldn't tell you. Every time someone opened their mouth, it was unbelievably painful. At times, I just had to laugh because someone out there thought that this could possibly be acceptable in a supposedly epic film. In fact, I found myself laughing quite often, when ridiculous plot impossibilities and predictabilities, and the ironic casting choice of a lead that looked quite precariously like a character from Troy, popped up on the screen. I have to say, even the pseudo-dramatic camera techniques came off as feigned attempts at creating drama where there was none. But hey, if you're only concerned with violent blood spatter, or watching Orlando peel his helmet off during every battle scene to expose his greasy wet wig, then I suppose you'd enjoy this 2 1/2 hour catastrophe.",Kingdom of Heaven
820,rhysticlightning,Ridley Scott's excellence is unstoppable; bring on the director's cut!,10,9 May 2005,"Ridley Scott is back with another great epic film, one you will love and never forget. The acting, action, and plot are enough to forgive the failures you may find in last year's epics (troy was the one good one)First off, Bloom. I know a lot of people are skeptical of him. Even I was a little worried after his lack of acting in Troy. Surprisingly, he's actually pretty convincing. He does a good job of showing a man lost, and later a new man, stronger and wiser after all that has been thrown at him. Even the love scenes he acts well in. Nowhere near as awesome as Russell Crowe in Gladiator, but still good enough to make you accept him as the character.The rest of the cast is impossibly excellent. Eva Green is stunningly beautiful, but also plays her part well. Jeremy Irons oh-so-honorable Tiberius is superb; his great acting is gruff and raging yet lost in a world he sees going mad. He pleads, he roars, and he's compelling, though I ended up wanting him on the screen more. Liam Neeson, though very briefly, is a standout as a man trying to make his son a man. Martin Csokas's Guy is sneering and vile and David Thewlis, as always, is never on the screen enough but makes his part so worthwhile when he's there; his compassion and knowledge is what guides Bloom and us.What will probably stand out most is the two actors you would not expect. The first is Ghassan Massoud as Saladin, a terrific performance that is never over-the-top but always in control. The stern face of the Syrian actor is always constant and always lets you know he's in control. The other is the voice of Edward Norton as Baldwin IV, leper king of Jerusalem. His voice shows us the loss of a man who can do almost nothing to stop the decay of all he has built, yet still a powerful man. Brendan Gleeson as the crazed Reynald is excellent but I didn't understand how he becomes so restrained later in the film.Next, the writing. William Monohan's script was bashed in the NY Times this summer by experts saying the film isn't right for the times. On the contrary, this is a very good script and not one that will cause controversy. Both sides are respectable and you can understand both of their causes. Saladin is a strong character not because we are justifying Muslim acts, but because that is who he was. On the flip side of the coin, we feel for Bloom and the defenders not because their white and Western, but because that's where the hero of the story is.The dialog is pretty good throughout the film, and the parallels between today are done without bashing our brains with an anvil to get the point across. Monohan has obviously been researching, and while he takes a few liberties, he still has a historically respectable script.Next, the action. Dear God, it is awesome. You could see only the last assault on Jerusalem and walk away entertained beyond belief. A brilliant combination of CGI and real towers, armies, and trebuchets turn the siege into an awe-inspiring event, rivaling Pelennor Fields and Helms Deep in LOTR. Towers fall, fireballs explode, and men charge into battle between the broken stones and you are blown away. Ridley Scott has proved himself once again to be the master of combat, if Gladiator and Black Hawk Down hadn't shown you that already. The other fights are also great.Gregson-Williams's music is great, a superb action score with choral music to sweep you back to the middle ages and brass and percussion not blasting but always moving to get you into the action. It's not a score you would've expected, but you will love it. It will draw comparisons to Gladiator's score (a more commanding brass army of sound), but they are both among the best for very different reasons.Lastly, Ridley Scott. The man's talent with actors, huge scope, and action is the best. He gets brilliant work out of a large cast. He brings the huge period of the Crusades into a large film yet never forgets the people within the story. His action scenes are memorable and will stand as some of the best ever. Thank you Ridley, for proving that the epic is still not lost, that grand huge flanking is still possible in today's expensive and critical world. And thank you for giving us a Crusades film that will not make the world worse but could show us a better way.This film may only get camera, CGI, score, and set design/costume Oscar noms, but it deserves pic, director, editing, and script as well, plus Massoud, Irons, and Neeson for their great supporting roles.You may find the film incomplete (I didn't), but if you aren't satisfied, just wait for the 3 h, 40min director's cut on DVD. I'm already doing that, waiting for what could be the best epic ever.",Kingdom of Heaven
821,Kimberlass,"Great Shots, Okay Acting, Awful Editing",5,8 May 2005,"With the current surge of epic battle movies, you have to have a lot to measure up in today's movie world. You need a good story, careful planning, character development, and an excellent execution of all of these things combined to be considered at all. Or you can do what Kingdom of Heaven did and just get a well known actor, try to shoot some big battle scenes and hope it sets well with the public.Don't get me wrong, I love the recent surge. I have loved most of them, from ""The Last Samurai"" to ""Troy"", and I am always up for strong battle scenes and an original soundtrack. I even love gore, being a special effects makeup junkie. But combine that with choppy editing (Which really distracted me from the story), poor characterization and nothing special in the story line that really set it apart, it just doesn't have much to offer.I must point out, though, that Orlando Bloom gained my respect at long last. It was in this movie that he finally proved to me that he was worth his position in the acting world. He shows a vast improvement in his skills in this movie and I was very pleased to see that he is in fact learning.All in all it was hard to sit through and wasn't as good as many other battle movies to date.

822,illicitchicken,Horrible Movie,2,18 May 2005,"There is little point in attempting to derive metaphysical truth from this movie- the most that can be said of it is that it had a fairly decent portrayal of Muslims, and that many christians are intolerant. The plot was ill conceived and poorly executed, that at times it was as though important plot points were edited out at the expense of common sense and good drama, but might, on suspects, be put back in for a DVD extended version. On the other hand, the battle scenes were much too long and even ridiculous, seemingly a favorite shot of the director was blood spraying out necks and glistening in the sunlight of the desert. Sure, battles at that time were gory and awful, yet so much of what happened was confusing-as much of the plot arch in the movie rested on a plot point that was so weak as to not even to make sense to begin with. Other than that there were some other minor irritations (spoliers ahead) such as: Why would an illegitimate blacksmith in the dark ages be literate? What was the point of the queen's character? What was her motivation? It was never clear. It seemed like all she did was seduce characters and then cut her hair. Why was she so powerless to stop/change events when she and her brother were the hereditary rulers, and seemed to have a fairly good idea of what would happen? Did he really go back to being a blacksmith? And if so, why was his wife riding off into the sunset in an ermine and velvet cloak? clearly horses and expensive furs would be well beyond the means of a humble peasant. Also, given the obsession with gross violence, I wonder why the director would shy away from showing a full sex scene.It seems like the director could have done more to develop the plot, and I am surprised that he didn'considering how much money this movie must have cost and the talent of the actors involved. It did have the potential to be a very interesting movie, however, it wasn't.

823,ncreadytogo,"Kingdom of Heaven ""Rocks""",10,7 May 2005,"I loved this movie. Ridley Scott has given us a masterpiece of a story evoking the struggles of a good man in a turbulent time, his struggles after his wife's death, his horrendous crime, and his search for forgiveness in the Kingdom of Heaven -- Jeruselum.Orlando Bloom embodies the role of Balian. His inner turmoil and loss are reflected in his eyes and body language. How he accepts his father's legacy and rises to become the defender of Jeruselum are awesomely portrayed by Bloom, who has grown from his boyish roles of elf and pirate, into a man of conviction and courage as Balian.Perhaps the best part of the movie shows that men of conscience and religious fanatics can be found on both sides and the futility of war. Ridley Scott drives home the horror of men killing one another in the name of their god, century after century. In my opinion, this is one of the best movies of the year and should be seen and discussed by everyone. The acting is excellent, the music is rousing and appropriate, and the battle scenes are awesome.

They are actually very similar; solid plot, great visuals, sometimes over-motivating music, great cast, and they share the same weakness: Orlando Bloom. In Troy, his character was better matched with his appearance, in Kingdom, he has a leading role. Why? I don't understand, if you have a dozen of brilliant actors (Liam Neeson, David Thewlis, Jeremy Irons, Edward Norton as King Baldwin), why would you pick Orlando for the leading role. A movie is best defined by the main character, and how that character is portrayed. The fact is, if you disregard Orlando's character, you will see some brilliant acting from the majority of other characters. With a different actor in the leading role, I would give this movie a 9/10 instead of 7. The movie is definitely worth seeing though.",Kingdom of Heaven

The greatness of this movie is in its composite effect and not identified by individual acting efforts. I have no doubt that this truly captured the image and depth of the medieval period in the 12th century. It was as though I were looking through the portal of a time machine. I was mesmerized by being returned in time to the era of our ancestors. A thousand years is a split second on the geologic scale and so much has changed in that short time in human civilization.

Watch its, it was worth my 8 dollars, and you will not be disappointed. Oh yea, Orlando Bloom i have always thought of him as a fag, but in this movie he proved to me that he can act like a man, and he uses the sword like a bad ass. I would also think he would get a nomination for his part. God, so many things i can talk about, but its late, cinematography was excellent, the visual effects were stunning, better that Return of the King which i thought no movie could possibly beat, the costumes were awesome, and of coarse the feeling you get from the film when you watch it, cant really explain it, made you feel as if somehow they had a camera back then and filmed these guys fight, heh, great movie, to those of you that haven't seen it, go watch it and to those who have seen it, watch it again :p",Kingdom of Heaven

The story is a little unclear in the beginning, slowing our identification with the main characters. However, I am quite willing to forgive imperfection when I witness a piece of art like this that forces true introspection into our lives and especially our current world.

Orlando Bloom is believable in his role, great performance by Liam Neesom but I would have liked to have seen a bigger part for Jeremy Irons. Some people may be disappointed when comparing this film to other great films by Ridley Scott, and most recently compared to Gladiator. Even so, Kingdom of Heaven may not rank among the classics, it is still a very enjoyable film with great action. Unless you only leave your home once a year for that *one* film, I would recommend anyone to go and see it.",Kingdom of Heaven
829,theoneandonly2234,Countless Battle Scenes Draw Away From the History,6,8 April 2013,"The movie The Kingdome of Heaven tells the story of Balion, who is a French blacksmith that goes on the Crusades. The movie shows scene after scene of epic battling with blood, horses and swords. He becomes a knight and fights in the Crusades to redeem himself. The movie also shows a romance on the side between Balion and a forbidden queen that Balion finds himself with. The countless battle scenes become a bit repetitive and they draw the viewer away from learning about the Crusades. If you wanted to learn about the Crusades, this movie doesn't exactly explain them very well. But, if you like action-packed movies that don't have a very developed plot, this movie is perfect. This movie is called Kingdom of Heaven and was made in 2005. The director of Kingdom of Heaven is Ridley Scott. Scott also directed Alien, Prometheus and Black Hawk Down. The writer of this movie is William Monahan. He's written other movies like The Departed, Body of Lies and Edge of Darkness. The rating of the movie is R which is understandable for all the blood and violence. The movie stars Orlando Bloom, Eva Green and Liam Neeson (I love Neeson). The main plot of the movie is the story of a blacksmith who goes on to be a knight and defends Jerusalem in the Crusades. The black smith's name is Balion. His wife has committed suicide and he is going to fight in the Crusades to redeem himself with god. He leaves his town to join the Crusades and winds up with duels and fights everywhere. Balion is a strong character who is played by Orlando Bloom. He is said to be the son of Godfrey. Godfrey is a knight in the Crusades with a respectable reputation in the Holy Land. Though Balion is not actually Godfrey's son, he tells everyone he is which earns him respect on his fight to Jerusalem. Godfrey is the one who takes Balion on the journey to Jerusalem. The two train and Balion learns lots. Something that interested me in the movie was how much the battle scenes drew away from the Crusades themselves. Sure, there lots of battles but shouldn't there have been more explanation? Not only did the blood and gore over empower the facts and learning of the Crusades, but the vastly computer-generated armies did too. Seeing CGI implemented into this movie made it seem more like an action movie than a historic- drama. That disappointed me because I was hoping to get a better explanation of the Crusades seeing as the textbook didn't do it for me. If I wanted to watch bloody battles with not much care for a plot, I would go and play Call of Duty on my Xbox. Of course, maybe I'm not old enough to see the plot and developed characters in this movie. If that's the case, then it needed to be more obvious so a wider range of viewers could enjoy it.I've never written a movie review before and only a couple of normal reviews at that, so I don't think I have the best view for movies. I love watching them and they give lots of good information and entertain me. This movie however, did not give me lots of good information. It did entertain me, but not the way I wanted it to. I recommend this movie to anyone who would the like a good action movie. If battles and wars are your thing, knock yourself out. However, seeing as I am a student and want to LEARN, this movie didn't do the job and didn't do the history of the Crusades justice. I hope that some people might be able to get something out this movie about the Crusades and learn something. Maybe I just didn't pay attention enough. Like I said, I'm no critic. I think this movie would appeal to all ages because any age might like a middle-age's war movies. I would be more than happy to watch this movie one night on Netlfix, but not as a visual to learn about the Crusades at school.",Kingdom of Heaven
830,illegallyblondechick306,Great Scott,10,16 May 2005,"This is a fantastic movie. As a 17 year old female i may be accused of only seeing this because of Orlando Bloom. But the story attracted me long before the actor. However Orlando does manage to hold his own as a leading man. He is charming, mature and seems to have a wisdom beyond his years. The rest of the cast do a fantastic job especially Eva Green and Liam Neeson. The story had me grabbed within minutes and it really felt as though I was going on a crusade with the characters. It is a gripping movie that I would recommend to anyone. It has a great cast, plot and has been made with the care I would expect from Ridley Scott. Looks like he has another hit to add to his list.",Kingdom of Heaven
831,maseplus,what a disappointment!!! and what an amazing miscast... Gladiator1/2,3,9 May 2005,"This movie is one big disappointment. I love Gladiator and adore Ridley Scott's work for being a genius but this movie was nothing but an uninspired, weak and often too slow-paced copy of Gladiator. Orlando Bloom - a blacksmith (again) - OK. so far so good. He's been fine in Pirates of the Caribbean, and has done good as Legolas but a portrayal similar to Maximus in Gladiator is such a bad joke. He becomes the rebel-hero against the King (what a nice new idea) and finally the general. How in heaven's name can you put Bloom-kid into this position? It's such an amazing miscast... The story starts to slow, the images don't only remind you of Gladiator it's almost a 1:1 copy... It is so sad that even the plot and it's conflicts seem to lack inspiration and again we have to go back to the big successful Gladiator-pool to dig out some nice old ideas... The music is a little mix from Blackhawk Down and Gladiator, but I think we've heard it already. Can't there be something more creative than this? When it comes to the battle scenes the disappointment is even bigger: SCOTT'S great sword-fights from Gladiator remain unrivaled - compared to that: Kingdom of Heaven seems to be half or quarter-size. The battle-scenes from Alexander were much better and the final battle of Jerusalem is nothing compared to Lord of the Rings. I feel so sad but they should have done Gladiator 2 instead of Gladiator 1/2",Kingdom of Heaven
832,cjk1701,"An epic motion picture, but a half-baked story.",1,16 May 2005,"First I must say that I was very pleasantly surprised by Mr. Bloom's performance, and the overall quality of the actors. Bloom is shaping up to be a good, solid actor, and in Kingdom of Heaven he is being supported by a number of excellent actors, both long established (Irons and Neeson) and relatively underrepresented on the big screen (Thewlis and Siddig).Yet despite the brilliant acting, the moving soundtrack and the excellent effects and camera work, I was very disappointed with the film. In my opinion, it fails to create an emotional connection to any of the characters, and so the plot seems a jumble of barely connected events rather than character development.Bloom's character appears very flat and without deeper motivations; I was entirely unable to sympathise with his conflicts and predicaments. The film's love story fails to deliver any tension striving towards resolution, and so appears both unnecessary and badly scripted.The portrayal of the historical details is geared towards modern sensibilities, and in its effort to be politically correct falls together in a confused jumble of rich colours and altogether implausible mores and morals.In my opinion, the film fails at being either an epic picture of a character's progression or an inspired depiction of a historical situation.Flat and disappointing.",Kingdom of Heaven

834,Patroklos68,Kingdom of Mediocrity,1,18 September 2006,"OK, I am a fan of much of Scott's previous work and had enjoyed Troy, despite the negative reaction, so thought I'd form my own opinion on this. Disappointingly it failed on so many levels. I won't attempt to reiterate the many accurate points already posted - so will limit myself to a few observances: The IMDb rating - indicative of the distortion in reality when (surely) a minority post very positive views and (surely) the majority cannot be bothered. Worrying as I check the site for a referral, primarily concerning less known films.The filmmakers' agenda - wow, the UN charter was this close to being ratified back in the 12th century. Who knew? Ghastly faux depiction of the relevance of religion to people who believed in a time of religion. I have the feeling that, if showed the film these protagonists would have sadly shaken their collective heads. Truly horrible moralising - and I am a liberal! The persona - Saladin was a noble man, for the time - Kofi Annan he was not. Guy and Reynald were not Templars - members of this monastic order had foregone all land and titles. Reynald was a ghastly, odious pig - a bandit and warmonger who could have been developed as a cunning and forceful villain, not the insane buffoon of the movie. Guy was an ambitious but weak and contrary personality.To anyone who enjoyed this film and has any interest in history I implore you to read up on the period. Zoe Oldenbourg's the Crusades is a comprehensive source and the Dream and the Tomb (forget the author) is also pretty insightful.",Kingdom of Heaven
835,eeeeelcooooo,Subtle wisdom and beautiful battle,10,6 May 2005,"I was getting a bit tired of movies with hundreds of extras on horses and the obligatory ""Have No Fear"" speeches. It is tempting to throw Kingdom Of Heaven on the same pile as Troy or Alexander, but the great difference is, of course, Ridley Scott. The man's got great taste and he can tell a rather complicated story in a crystal clear way. There is only one enormous battle in the movie, and it is so beautifully and touchingly crafted that it blew me away (and after the three LOTR-movies, PLUS Troy and Alexander, that is a real triumph). The only flaw in the movie in my opinion is the casting of Orlando Bloom. He is too much of a slick teen idol to give Balian the same inner torment as Russel Crowe did for Maximus in Gladiator. The fact that this hardly affects the film is, again, the mark of Scott's genius. He is capable of handling the rather slippery contents of KOH dealing with differences between Muslims and Christians with great wisdom and class, subtlety and nuance. The image of the Muslim and Christian soldiers crashing into each other at the hole in the wall of Jerusalem so ragingly that they just form one immobile block of angry men, so wound up in their beliefs that there is no space for movement says so much about the state of the world today. It's images like these that give KOH its heart and soul.",Kingdom of Heaven
836,jahrome17,Kingdom of BOOOOORING,3,6 May 2005,"This movie nearly put me and most of my 12 friends to sleep when we went to see it tonight.There were few redeeming qualities to this movie. I've heard that the history is incorrect, but I don't really know or care about the historical correctness of the movie. The movie was, however, pretty bad. The script was dry, and the actors were, with one or two exceptions, stiff and lifeless - ESPECIALLY Orlando Bloom. The story was extremely formulaic - nothing unpredictable in the movie. I also found myself completely unable to relate to any of the characters, and I never felt any emotions towards any group of people in the movie. I just didn't care about any of them. The battle scenes looked suspiciously familiar to the battle scenes in the Lord of the Rings movies, but they were a lot cornier. The blood and gore was a bit shocking to some at first, but that gradually died as it kept coming. Most of all, it was long, with poor character development, and not nearly enough action to keep up the film's energy.The film was done well as far as technique is concerned, which is why this movie gets a 3 and not a 1. See it if you love epic action movies, and if that's the case, see it in the theatres because battle scenes are always better on the big screen. Otherwise, avoid it at all costs. Or at least bring a pillow along and take a nap.",Kingdom of Heaven
837,Spike_Angel_Xander,Really good movie!,10,7 May 2005,I just went to see this movie today and I think its really good. The movie was very really created. The actor gave their all to the characters they played. Which made it all seem real. I would also give like to give the writers their credit as well. Its very original script. The director did a really great job with the film. I do recommend this movie for anyone who likes fighting movies. Though it does have a lot of blood in it. Its not all that gruesome. The fight scenes in this movie rival those in the movie Troy.Orlando's performance was one of his best I think anyway. He really shows his acting abilities. I give the whole movie ten stars.,Kingdom of Heaven

The deletion and brevity of the love scenes left me with uncertainty about the relationship between Balian and Sybilla. The fight scenes were vigorous and violent as war is but I tired of the blood splashes and droplets that spewed on screen. The cast was first-rate but I felt some of the characters were overplayed. The storyline is somewhat predictable but the fight scenes jump off the screen. I wouldn't say the movie is anti Christian but it does depict many of the Christians as blood-thirsty tyrants. All of the Muslem characters are portrayed as humane and sympathetic. Of course the reality is that both groups have a combination of these characteristics.

I Think there couldn't have been a more perfect day to release this movie, or a more perfect movie to release that day.Ridley Scott Tells us an amazing story, though honestly I think he shows us a little bit too much blood in the battles. I think it is not necessary to do that, but I believe Orlando Bloom said in one of the interviews on the movie that they really needed to show how terrible those fights were. And they certainly made it clear by those details.The story really got to me, It is impressing how it's actually all still going on at the moment. And I loved Orlando Bloom, He had to be pretty good to set things straight after troy, but he certainly did. It seems to me, that every movie we get to see with Orlando in it shows us a greater and better actor every time.The only point of critic for me is that Ridley Scott thinks that the audience already knows a lot of the story of Jerusalem. You have to have certain knowledge before you go to see the movie , to get the essence of it, and i think that will influence a lot op opinions about this movie.",Kingdom of Heaven
840,dejathoris,Another feast for the eyes by Ridley Scott,8,15 October 2005,"Kingdom of Heaven for film lovers who love movies that you can escape into, almost feel the atmosphere on your skin, smell the scents in the air and once it's over, feel like you have a couple hours journey though another place. Ridley Scott is a master of creating rich visuals and powerful story and characters which transport the viewer into their world. This film does not disappoint on that score.Whether the story is not politically correct or overly politically correct, or not historically accurate is not entirely why I go to films. I always assume some license will be taken for the sake of the moving the story within a limited time frame. When I go films, I want to be entertained. I want stories and characters that you can involve yourself in just for a short while. And movie is just that: entertainment. Artistic license was taken with historical events and time but what film doesn't do this to some degree? With this film, sit down and enjoy the ride, and then later if you like, curl up with a good book and read up on the actual people and events.All the actors were fantastic, especially Liam Neeson, David Thewlis, Jeremy Irons (I would have like to have seen about his character), Brendan Gleeson, Alexander Siddig (come a long way since Deep Space 9!), my favorite of all was Ghassan Massoud as Saladin. Every time he was on screen, the film just got even better. The musical score is truly Oscar worthy, and I hope we see Oscar nominations for costumes by Janty Yates as well (among hopefully many others).",Kingdom of Heaven
841,fabersimgalati,The movie is a kitsch. Characters of the XII-th Century have post-modernist discourses,3,18 October 2013,"A lot of efforts for so few results... The correct term to describe this movie is kitsch. The main character, Balian, is inconsistent and the director makes everything to prove it. He is dedicated to his dead wife but has no problem in committing adultery, he initially seems to be so peaceful, a Jesus sort of person, and yet kills his brother and so many other people without remorse. He's religious and still a post-modernist in the... XII-th century! His discourse toward his army in the defense of Jerusalem is absolutely a big non-sense and a total failure in order to reveal the basic principle which constitutes the essence of the crusades - to deny the importance of the Holy Place and to consider that the only thing important is the people who inhabit it means, simply, to avoid completely the spirit of the historical period. It's outrageous. P.S. I'm sorry, but also the faces of the main characters, those of Orlando Bloom's and Eva Green's, has so little depth in this movie where the depth is so important considering that the whole affair is about a very deep spiritual conviction.",Kingdom of Heaven

843,factcheck,"A decent movie, though not a great one.",6,3 August 2005,"A decent movie, though not a great one.Scott has an irritating habit of cutting out all the action. For the first two thirds of the movie, he tends to either set up something, and then jump right to the aftermath without showing what was in between. Sometimes random events are shown this way, resulting in a rather disjointed and interrupted feeling, as everything will be fine, and then a scene change later everything's gone to hell. For example, the initial charge in battles are often shown, but before the armies even meet it skips to the aftermath of corpses and prisoners. This hurts both comprehension of what's going on, AND the appeal of the movie for the balls-out action stuff.The characters seem somewhat shallow. There's a lot of them, and so the screen time isn't really there to fully develop any of them, including Bloom's character of Balian. Motivations are often set up with single lines of expository dialog, and this is barely adequate. It's black capes, top hats and mustache twirling time.For those with an interest in history, this movie will be a mixed bag. It's worth watching for the spectacular vistas and battles, and the ambiance and setting is wonderful. But you'll constantly be dragged out of the immersion of the movie when they break with the historical narrative and do something boneheaded. If you can put that aside and enjoy the movie for what it is - a costume drama - then you'll enjoy it. If not, you'll appreciate the visuals, but be groaning and rolling your eyes a lot.",Kingdom of Heaven

845,film_buff87,Bloom lacks presence,7,6 May 2005,"Kingdom of Heaven is a very satisfactory epic. The technical section is very good as it happens with most Hollywood films these days. Great photography, with the colors adding to the mood. Cold and harsh in the scenes taking place in France, warm and cruel in the desert.The actors, and especially the supporting cast are awesome. Great names appear, like Edward Norton, Jeremy Irons, Brendan Gleeson, David Thewlis, and of course the one and only Liam Neeson who once again gives a magnificent, wort-watching performance as Orlando Bloom's father, the Baron of Ibelin. The Arab actors are also amazing, I never had a chance to see them in anything else before.Which brings me to what the problem of the film is in my opinion. Orlando Bloom is not enough to carry a film on his shoulders as protagonist, especially an epic of this scale. He lacks the overpowering presence of, for example Russel Crowe, of whom I kept thinking while watching the film. I believe that an older, more mature actor could have pulled it off better.In any case, Kingdom of Heaven is a very good epic and whoever likes this genre will enjoy it",Kingdom of Heaven

This is a master of his craft! He displays a comprehensive understanding of film-making and visual storytelling. Think of some of the dialogue alone.

847,thesportsbook,Vacuous self-congratulatory message movie wannabe,2,7 May 2005,"Short anecdote: many people in the theater were actually laughing AT the movie and not with it. The most ""serious"" scenes were cause for several loud guffaws, and I believe I heard a ""gimme a f-in break"" toward the end. Here is how it works: A high-concept script lands on Ridley Scott's desk and because he's Ridley Scott he can get it made tomorrow. But the script is lacking. Either it's way too smart or way too dumb. After dozens of rewrites (of what was to begin with either a brilliant character piece wrapped into a Crusade story or a huge, hulking disjointed orgy of pretty pictures and 50's era Epic Talk), the script is rushed into production a far cry from what it came in as and light years away from being decent, because Orlando Bloom wants to do a quick recovery from playing the fop against Brad Pitt and Eric Bana. Orlando Bloom, Ridley Scott, 100 million dollars, and a message of Muslim/Christian unity. So the film is basically a vehicle for each of the separate parts- Bloom, Scott, the Studio- to reach a personal end- A leading role; A huge paycheck; And a blockbuster we can finally get on 3000 screens in Saudi Arabia, Palestine, and Jordan, markets we just can't penetrate. (Damn you, Bollywood!) In other words, borne of the least noble of intentions and executed in the most cynical and lazy manner imaginable, Kingdom of Heaven is an absolutely unbearable flop. Here's another insider scoop: Did you ever wonder why the only two things you EVER heard about the film were the title and Orlando Bloom's name? Do you want to to know why the trailers just showed a bunch of pretty images and slow-mo battle scenes? Did you ever wonder why there was no voice over- ""He was denied his one true passion... bringing water to the people of Akra"" or something like that to reveal the essence of the story? Because there was no story. There was no main character or development thereof. Really the movie is a series of jarring images and canned dialogue, to the point it was almost offensive. Do not go see this movie. Ridley, you sold your soul, baby. This was crap and you know it.",Kingdom of Heaven
848,Mister_spanky,Heavenly.,10,7 October 2005,"At long last we have what has eluded us since the dawn of film history, the perfect epic.From Alexander Nevsky through Ben-Hur to Gladiator, epics have have thrilled us and left us in awe at the spectacle of huge sets, gigantic action set-pieces and larger than life characters who take us on their journey through fire and water and have us cheering them right up until the glorius end. The problem with epics is that they rarely rise above the spectacle that defines them and while we usually leave the cinema with a feeling of satisfaction it is seldom coupled with a sense of illumination. However, Sir Ridley Scott has delivered a real tour de force in cinematic endeavour.Kingdom Of Heaven boasts the biggest sets one has ever seen, a dedication to detail that utterly envelops the audience and transports them into the middle ages, some of the greatest battle scenes to be experienced on film including the most authentic siege ever reproduced, a thundering yet touching score, a wonderful assortment of fascinating characters and best of all, meaning.Scott obviously wanted to teach us all a philosophical lesson and the film often plays like a socratic lecture(which is probably why some of the more narrow-minded critics have labled the film as ""boring"") with the nihilist incarnate central protagonist's soul being chipped away by the views of others and by his own life lessons until it is a finely crafted sculpture of realization and truth.

849,globalwriter,Scott reads the zeitgeist right again,9,13 May 2005,"Ridely Scott is a man with his finger on the pulse of the collective unconscious. Bladerunner came out when the country was worried about declining competitiveness and Japan buying out everything and ends with the leads driving into the countryside. Japan's bubble power didn't last long, but exurbia migration and cocooning proved to be a trend. Blackhawk Down presaged America's involvement in unwinnable wars against low tech adversaries who just want to be left alone. Iraq shows that we are still on the same road and while we can applaud the ""leave no man behind"" motto, little thought is given to the ""skinnies"" (now rag-heads) who fall by the wayside. In Kingdom of Heaven, Scott manages to wins over moderate audiences on both sides of the subject matter by having Balian a character with a temperate viewpoint as the hero and the center of the narrative.Balian starts his journey to Jereusalem after killing the village priest in a fit of rage. The cleric not only had his wife's body decapitated (Church rule in those days for the sin of suicide), but had the nerve to steal the cross off her corpse. His father is fatally wounded defending Balian from the pursuing ""posse"" but by saving Balian's life, he seems to (psychologically) makes up for his long absence. Shipwrecked during the crossing from Italy to the Holyland, Balian encounters and kills an Arab knight who accosts him, but spares the man's servant. Unbeknownst to Balian, the ""slave"" that he treats kindly turns out to be a top lieutenant to Saladin, a pivotal point later on.Taking his father's place at the court of King Baldwin, Balian is caught between the moderate policies of the King and his Marshall (Jeremy Irons) and the extremists who are pushing for a war. Being handsome and a man of the people (he gets down in the dirt with his peasants) proves irresistible to King Balwin's sister and she soon comes to Balian with an offer he can't resist. Unfortunately, after one too many provocation, Saladin's forces attack and Balian must throw his forces into a suidicidal charge against overwhelming odds to cover the retreat of some civilians. The commander of the Arab forces turn out to be the ""slave"" Balian had earlier set free who now returns the favor.Baldwin and Saladin manage to restore a truce, but there is rumbling in both camps. Near death from leprosy, Balwin offers Balian the crown, but he refuses knowing it would mean death to many knights who would oppose such a move. Reminiscent of Gladiator, the refusal leads to deadly reprisal once the king is dead. The new king instigates an offensive against Saladin and his ill prepared expedition is wiped out in the dessert by the Arabs. With only three days to prepare a defense, Balian rallies the people of Jerusalem into a formidable force.Balian's pre-battle speech is the core message of the movie and Scott seems to be speaking to all of us - the monuments and religious claims don't matter, the lives of the people do. Mounting a heroic defense, Balian manages to win a concession from Saladin to allow the safe evacuation of all Christians from the city. The historical fact that Saladin lived up to this promise is one of the reasons why even biased European accounts of the crusades tend to paint him in a good light.The movie closes with Balian returning to his village for one last look with his companion (the former queen of Jerusalem) and meeting up with Richard the Lionheart (King of England) who is on his way to ""liberate"" the Holyland. Balian demure that he is only the blacksmith then rides off into the sunset.The Kingdom of Heaven as a place where all can worship in peace is an ideal that cannot be imposed by force of arms. Religious fanatics on the other hand have no better rallying point then the earthly monuments that belong to their respective traditions. Scott's movie is a timely reminder that in this critical time, we should carefully analyze calls to new crusades in the name for a higher cause that ignores the cost in human lives.",Kingdom of Heaven

The ""moral choice"" of turning down a position of power if it will cause a death was false, because he knew it would result in thousands of deaths. To say ""I will not be an accomplice to murder"" but accept that this lack of action will result in thousands of deaths makes you a far worse person than a single murderer.

Also, the fact that some of the Crusaders tried to improve the conditions and some were there for glory and personal gain was made apparent. The whole story was good for the soul.

What is a man's soul worth?,8,15 May 2005,"In 'Kingdom of Heaven' Ridley Scott has drawn together decades of work on the concepts of faith, duty and courage that reaches back to 'The Duellists'. This is primarily a man's world, but it is to the credit of 'Kingdom of Heaven' that in this film there is a real sense of the worth that the ordinary people of Jerusalem put on their lives and their city. Similarly, for a movie that some critics have described as emotionally detached it is curious that so many images are imprinted on one's memory  and so many of the characters catch at the heart. We care what happens to these figures, on all sides of the conflict; the warriors played by Orlando Bloom and Alexander Siddiq are brothers under the skin.Visually, this film is stunning - more so than 'Gladiator'. Time and again settings and action combine into unforgettable images that convey mood and theme  snowflakes whirl around Godrey of Ibelin and his son as they begin to find the measure of one another in a landscape as bleak as the young man's mood; Balian, newly arrived in the Holy Land, trudges up a sand dune his father's sword slung over his back; later, the richness and sophistication of the room where he awakens in Jerusalem, conveys the strangeness of his translation to a man whose world is suddenly immeasurably richer than he could have conceived of - and yet who cares nothing for the material wealth of the Holy Land that is the focus of so much greed; Balian walks carefully through the green patchwork of crops his irrigation scheme has created and when others later praise his fighting skills comparing him to his father, we know that this young man could be a better man than Godfrey, caring for the day-to-day lives of his people as well as for their safety.The battles, skirmishes and duels are a finely judged mix of violence, confusion and narrative line  once or twice the glint of the jewel in the pommel of Godfrey's sword seems enhanced to enable the viewer to keep track of Balian in the mêlée. Whilst the toppling of the siege towers and the boiling oil are spectacular, the rhythm of the defence of Jerusalem conveys a real sense of the stop/start attrition of siege warfare better than in 'The Two Towers'  each day the city survives is a triumph, although at terrible cost, and the battle is making new heroes  but can they stand another day? The weakness is the editing of this film to cinema length in such a way that it hollows out plot lines and character development. Liam Neeson perhaps comes out of it best in that his character is so crucial to the beginning of Balian's journey that Godrey's personal search for forgiveness appears a coherent development. Other characters require one note, as in the case of Gleeson's manic Templar or Thewlis' gentle and wise Hospitaler, or the final laying down of a lived role to reveal the individual behind it  both Jeremy Irons and Edward Norton benefit here.The primary loser is Eva Green, for we see too little of her, particularly with Orlando Bloom, to get a sense of the duty that binds Sybilla and the individual caught within a public role she has been schooled for all her life, who finds the courage to lay it aside  although the final shot of Balian and Sybilla riding away from his old village on fine horses, Sybilla wrapped in a fur-trimmed robe and Balian still wearing his father's sword, make it clear that whatever he might have told King Richard, who seeks Balian 'the defender of Jerusalem', his words are metaphorical and Balian is not working as a blacksmith.And what of Orlando Bloom? This is good work. Balian's is the most complex journey, from grief and anger, through tests both physical and spiritual, to a new self-knowledge and confidence enough to stand aside from the pressure to conform. We welcome the few slight smiles as evidence that Balian is tempering grief with some joy in living. He makes Balian his own and the extended version may flesh out some of the gradual movement in the character. If one looks at Jeremy Irons twenty years ago, one can see how, as Bloom ages, his handsome face will naturally acquire more character and his voice will lower with use and weight.This is not, as it currently stands, a great film, an iconic film  but perhaps at its full length it will be. In the meantime, a subject so challenging for twenty-first century mass cinema audiences has been tackled with real integrity and that is a tribute to all concerned.",Kingdom of Heaven

I sat down ready to be entertained, 1 hour and 10 minutes into the movies, I was staggered by how uninterested in any of the characters I was. Bad acting, bad editing, bad dialogue, bad characters - spectacular vistas cannot overcome something as trivial as this piece of nonsense. Even Guy de Lusignan failed to raise a laugh (the character was supposed to be funny  wasn't he) I think John Clesse should have played this part.

855,tRaeR,What?¿,4,12 May 2005,"I think it may just be me, but this movie was awful! from the editing to the acting, lets not forget the fact that Orlando Bloom in a role such as this has no real captivating power over an audience. Orlando may be a leading man for a love story type role but put in the position where he has to make us believe he could quite possibly be ""King"" material is not going to fool me. You may think that i am taking a dig at, Orlando Bloom, but i believe him to be a good actor in the right role - take for instance ,Pirates of the Caribbean, where i accepted him as the person he portrayed.One if the main things that disturbed me about the movie was that there was no opposition to his command, i know that would have made the movie longer than the many hours it went on anyway, but it would have at least made it slightly more believable because as far as i can remember, the movie seemed to revolve more around the greatness of ""The son of Godfrey"" and his knighted, which he never deserved in the first place, nor ever proved - although in his favour he did admit it. However my argument stems from the fact that those walls were protected for over a thousand years and they let 1 man whom they never knew into the city and allowed him full access to the army and his fathers kingdom without so much as a whisper from anybody that knew him before hand. The scene with the big guy and the crusaders at the fountain where he asks how tall Godfrey was and what colour eyes he had as if to say this was his form of identification and then to top it all off, after all this has gone down the priest guy (whoever he is - is it not martin short, i am probably way of mark - but he sounds and looks like him. ) shows up and there is a slight hello between them as if to say, ""right you have overcome them, now the king then the city"".

I wont give away the plot or story but you can probably guess what the general outline is but the unique thing about this is that its not a good VS bad story more of a choose your side story. The action was superb and the battle sequences were breathtaking on a scale with the LOTR trilogy but in my opinion i think that the K.O.H action sequences were better because they didn't look like anything you'd ever seen before. David Thewlis, Liam Neeson, Eva Green, Nasser Memarzia, Jeremy Irons, Edward Norton, Marton Csokas, Jouko Ahola, Alexander Siddig were all brilliant but special praise must be set aside for Ghassan Massoud who was excellent playing Salahdin the leader of the Muslims. you mite be thinking that i forgot to mention Orlando Bloom the so called ""star"" of the film but i didn't forget him i just think the less attention we draw to his performance the better because he was literally the only negative the film has Russel Crowe and Tom Cruise he ain't, they should have gone with Goran Visnjic who Ridley Scott had first intended to put in the picture.

Martin Csokas, Liam Neeson, Eva Green, Edward Norton, and David Thewlis all gave great performances. The fight scenes were enormous!

And of course, a warm (un)satisfying ending where everybody gets to home in peace. It should give the audience a warm fuzzy feeling -- not a nauseous one! Honestly, I don't know a lot about the historical accuracy concerning the fall of Jersusalem. But I know that crusaders journeyed east when Christianity was getting a real hold on Europe. They traveled east seeking Zion and to assure their future in Heaven. It was serious stuff. I felt this movie washed over all of this...The movie starts off interesting enough, with the tragic Bailian traipsing off to Jerusalem on a worthy quest, to fulfill the obligations of his dead father and to redeem his soul, and the soul of his wife.

I found the story some what boring even though it had the usual sword fights and battle scenes. The action of this film also seems to be borrowed from other movies. The whole ""let them come"" speech stated by bloom sounded as if it were the same in Lord of the Rings: return of the king. Even the design of the surroundings this same sequence seemed copied. (The marching force of the Muslims looked as if it was missing an orc or to). I must say however the acting by bloom is by far the best I've seen, I thought he was more relaxed into his character unlike in Pirates of the Caribbean and the Lord of the Rings saga.

Kingdom of Heaven is a similar heroic fable yet the good and evil polarity is slightly more ambiguous. I would say it was vastly better than Alexander. Ridley Scott's style (cinematography and music) as seen in Black Hawk Down and Gladiator also lend a wonderful historical ambiance. Orlando Bloom does a fine job as the lead, and the French actress is fantastic (and beautiful), but my favorite lead was the Leper King and the wise nobility of his character. The battle scenes are excellent (including one in falling snow in which the snowflakes seem to hang in the air) and the armies look very historically realistic - this is a very good-looking epic. Formulaic perhaps, but well-executed.

862,kit-sung,Boring and underwritten,3,29 April 2005,"This film lacks, as so many Ridley Scott movies do, a coherent narrative, but what is worse (and is certainly not helped by Orlando Blooms lack of charisma) is the lack of a convincing and interesting central character. Bloom changes from poor blacksmith, to super-intelligent strategist in no time and for no good reason at all. The lack of a clear antagonists adds to the emotional detachment, which makes the picture, even though nicely shot, ultimately a boring experience. Surprisingly enough, even the supporting actors such as Brandon Gleeson, Jeremy Irons and Eva Green add little to the film, Edward Norton, wearing a mask all the time, is rather wasted, even though his character, the King of Jerusalem, who tries to balance the religions, could have been an interesting part (Although not mentioning the problematically simplified depiction of historic events and people.)

863,ace_gt2k,Missed the chance to be a great movie,5,7 May 2005,"The movie had the opportunity to be something memorable but it missed the chance. Firstly, the viewers were not given a good overview of the history of Jerusalem, so some of the viewers could not really figure out what is happening. The story started with an sub-par battle scene where some very interesting characters got slaughtered, which is a shame.Then the hero got promoted to be the new head of a group of soldiers and he amazingly learned to fight like a warrior in a very short time. Jerusalem was nicely made up but somehow does not really feel like a troubled city desired by many. Jeremy Irons and Edward Norton were very good in their roles but Orlando Bloom seems to be incapable to fill Balian's shoes. He is just too small to be a believable warrior and does not have commanding presence to rule over desperate people.One of the battle score is borrowed from the 13th warrior, so the feeling of watching a unique movie is not there.

864,kevin-sterns,So Much Potential - And So Boring,4,3 May 2005,"No amount of costumes, sets, or special effects can rescue this film from its mediocre script and shaky camera work. If Ridley Scott really IS one of Hollywood's top directors, the industry is hurting for talent.The story opens promisingly, but loses steam. Lines are mumbled. Pointless scenes linger and drag. Dialog is overwhelmed by so much pseudo-theological babble, it feels like medieval Sunday school. But the general population really did talk like that, right? Sure, and in the 50s, boys talked like Beaver Cleaver....Meanwhile, we are treated to endless closeups of inert faces. Are we searching for clues under a magnifying glass? Even the guy in the mask receives lingering camera scrutiny. I'm just guessing, but perhaps his body language would have communicated more than the steel plate over his face.The middle third of the film is pure torture, a slow tar pit that sucks all life out of the audience. The dreary boredom is belatedly relieved by a confused battle sequence. Yes, there are a few truly spectacular shots. But they're quickly overwhelmed by scenes so blurred and shaky that you might as well close your eyes - you won't miss a thing.It's maddening because the potential is enormous. Acting is strong. Costumes are gorgeous. Sets are spectacular. Digital effects are superb and seamless. But the plot wallows under the sheer weight of the film's pretentiousness. Dull moments are spiced up MTV style. Bam! Pow! Who needs to see the actor's entire head in the frame? Not Ridley Scott.

To sum it all up, a guy becomes a knight, falls in love, leads an army, loses, goes back to being normal again. All in about a week as portrayed through this film. I'm surprised the movie was so drawn out as well; this entire movie could've been done in under 2 hours. For every 5 minutes of fighting there's 20 minutes of talking. While dialogue helps to explain whats going on, too much of it bores the crap out of people, especially in a move such as this one in which you'd expect action. In my opinion, Orlando Bloom's talents were wasted on this movie. He's too talented of an actor to be cast in a boring production such as this one. My advice, keep the $8.50 and rent it for half the price, don't be surprised if its out on video next month.",Kingdom of Heaven
866,hamishbrown,Scott comes up a winner!,8,3 May 2005,"I just saw Kingdom of Heaven, Ridley Scott's latest at a media press preview yesterday. The screen was awash with all the unmistakable traits from the world famous director. His meticulous attention to detail, the sense of 'lived in reality' that simply jumps off the screen and his directing and scene compositions are always a joy to behold.Orlando Bloom surprised me. For the longest time I felt I could never believe him in anything else unless he had, long blond hair, pointed ears and a bow and arrow. Well, thanks to Scott, Bloom is now fully fledged as an actor to watch in the future. Some on this site have said he represents the Brit answer to Keannu Reeves. I found him to be an engaging lead who admittedly has a limited range of facial expressions. However he seems to have sunk his teeth quite deeply into the action bits of this movie with a rawness and fierceness that startles.All other roles are perfectly cast and the nobleness of Salahadin is especially pleasing. I was very surprised by Edward Norton in the role of the masked king Baldwin, his portrayal was moving and there is a real sadness when his affliction is revealed.I watched the movie with someone who admittedly hates science fiction, found Scotts' earlier movie Black Hawk Down too violent and is far more at peace with a romantic comedy.

Liam Neeson dies in the beginning of the movie. Eva Green could have played a French maid, not the queen of Jerusalem. And this ridiculous mask on Edward Norton's face...Battle scenes remind of the ones from Alexander - too fast to catch and understand. Siege of Jerusalem looks like the scene from some movie about World War I with all those explosions.The best part of the movie is religious tolerance. Muslims pictured not as assassins and blood thirsty creatures, but rather wise warriors longing for righteous revenge. Balian and Baldwin both understand the importance of peace in the holy place. But what about Jews? There should have been some in Jerusalem at that time.Anyway, if you fancy this sort of historical crap and have more than two hours, go ahead, watch it.

Although the visual aspects of the film were astounding and quite incredible the film seemed to lack a substantial plot. The story idea of the movie was a wonderful idea but the way the film came across made the overall feeling of the movie dwindle down. Once again we see Orlando Bloom in a war epic movie where he must make the decision of love or to do what is right. Bloom can certainly act but it seems that he is only cast into these types of films and seems a little bit redundant. Other people are comparing this movie to be the next Gladiator but I must disagree. The film didn't have that powerful of a moving feeling like Gladiator, in fact the only time that I felt remorse is in the bond between the Leper King and his sister. All in all, I wouldn't have paid to see this movie. I can't either say that I like or disliked it. The movie didn't move me towards anyway and left me wanting more from the plot.

What happened to the great adventure scenes that roused people out of their seats during epics like Braveheart, Gladiator, and even, to a smaller degree, Troy? A lot more could have been done for this movie in that department. Any bloodshed is, if anything, almost comical... coming off in some areas as a ""Shaun of the Dead""-esqe bloodiness. The fight scenes were decent, but, they were a lot like small Texas towns, spread out with very little in between. Hmmm... Crusaders, Hospitallers, Templars... fighting together? Christian doctrine being preached but not given much of an afterthought? Saladin as some sort of merciful man? Come on!!! Whoever the history ""buff"" for this movie was needs to get some of their facts right. First of all, not all Templars were bloodthirsty or anything of the sort. In fact, they were known as ""warrior monks,"" warrior meaning knight and monk meaning someone with quite a bit of spiritual fortitude and faith. Men such as Bernard de Clairvaux and St. Bernard were not bloodthirsty war-mongers. The Hospitallers, also, were not pansies who always took the high road, either. They did their share of fighting in the Holy Land. Was the name Hospitaller even mentioned in the movie? I know that ""Templar"" was said, on several occasions, almost with a snarl. I think it goes without saying that the whole religious aspect of the movie is a sort of smokescreen to make people believe that this movie will hit them on more levels than just action. It is about as deep, spiritually, as Al Sharpton is when it comes to knowledge on world politics. Last, Saladin was certainly a great leader of the Muslim people. But, he was not the most forgiving man at all. How about the side of him where he put to death hundreds of Templars by staking them to the ground and leaving them to bake inside of their armour in the desert sun? He did not attack only when provoked, as many people evidently believe, either. All in all, the movie was done quite poorly. There is no real evidence of trying to do anything new. The only plus about the movie is the lighting used at different parts, which, I admit, was pretty cool. I feel badly that this movie was not deeper on a spiritual level, as well as more entertaining with action.",Kingdom of Heaven

But it looks like its too easy to make these epic battle scenes now, so every chump is clamoring to get some historical event to validate the stock story of the underdog who goes on to victory, having sex with a queen along the way. Grrrrr. I think the other thing that made me feel like the whole thing was ridiculous was that EVERY camera angle, piece of music, character and fight scene has been lifted from another movie. Ridley Scott man, what happened!! This movie is like watching cliché after cliché. Its also the one epic movie where the violence was a bit too much, i'm a big fan of good fight scenes, but this was kind of bombardment with blood, kinda ineffective. Oh and the other thing... everyone talks in that breathy voice like everything they say is profound. ""my name is.... Balian"". People, I tell you avoid this movie! I'm sure it had its good points, but i just found it ridiculous, and its moral posturing was conceited and condescending.",Kingdom of Heaven

This quote was the most compelling element of Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven. That and ""What man is a man who does not try to make the world better?"" Lord knows I'm trying.Scott, himself, tries valiantly to direct another great movie, but sadly, it comes off as being just OK. Its better than ""Blackhawk Down"" but worse than ""Gladiator."" The battle scenes are not that exciting, the love-affair lacks suspense, and the politics are not that insightful. What makes this movie poignant and contemporary is its depiction of one of the world's most epic religious conflicts - The Crusades - and its relevance to contemporary conflict involving the very same antagonists, Muslims and Christians.As a Muslim convert from a strong Christian background, I find the dynamics of Muslim-Christian relations a topic dear to my heart. The theology is a little off, though. ""Their prophet says 'submit', ours says 'choose'"" says the Christian princess. Not exactly, but I can see where Scott is coming from. The protagonist, Balian (Orlando Bloom), is actually portrayed as more of a humanist than a religious crusader, which, I think, is not really historically accurate. Scott is probably projecting his modern-day secular/agnostic instincts back into a time when faith in God was assumed and the real question was ""whose God?"". That's OK, Ridley, since this is your movie, I guess you're allowed the benefit of indulging in a little soul-searching of your own.The acting, I thought, was pretty good. I'm not sure if I'd cast Edward Norton (I actually met him when I was a student in Montreal, as well as Robert Deniro and Wesley Snipes), as the wise but leprous king, but the other choices were more than fair. Saladin was played by an Arab, although he was a Kurd in real life. I always liked Alexander Siddig, especially when he played the affable doctor in the seldom-watched Star Trek: DS9. This time he gets to play a brave Muslim cavalryman, rather than the scaredy-cat he's often know for. Liam Neeson, Jeremy Irons, and Brendan Gleeson all serve admirably in their roles.The casting that I was most disappointed with was Orlando Bloom as the hero Balian. He's just not expressive enough as an actor. I don't really feel that he's feeling what he's supposed to be feeling. Maybe they should have chosen Eric Bana (of Troy-fame), who's just as inexpressive, but somehow more believable as a wise and heroic defender of the people. Maybe he didn't want to get typecast.Anyways, you could tell this cut of the movie was made for the theaters. It was 2 hours and 50 minutes, but it seemed like a lot was missing. Especially the actual battle scene between Reynald's Knights Templar in their encounter with Saladin in the desert. I guess I'm just going to have to watch the director's cut when it comes out on DVD, Insh'Allah (God-willing).",Kingdom of Heaven
881,rxmcgree,An unnecessary epic,4,7 October 2005,"Kingdom of heaven is a film which feels like it has been constantly torn between realism and fantasy. At times it strives to be historically accurate but then moves on to the opposite, at points it tries to accurately portray medieval warfare but then in the light of epic Lord of the Rings Battles throws this away and most noticeable is how it tries to see the whole crusading ideal through Muslim eyes yet shows very little interest in the Muslims themselves.I will start with the acting... As has been mentioned already Ed Norton inspires the required pathos that his role should carry, while Liam Neeson and Jeremy Irons carry themselves well as usual. Orlando Bloom is not too bad as the lead and I would say that it is the general script, making him come across as unquestionably wise, tolerant, magnanimous, and altogether 21st Century, which makes him appear like an idiot rather than his acting. I would have liked Reynald to have been more suave than the ugly barbarian they found but that is a casting problem and no fault of his.The set of Jerusalem was impressive. A nice city and I thought that the breach looked very good. With medieval France I think they tried to hard to draw a contrast between the purity of the enlightened East and the barbaric West, choosing dull lighting, bad weather and dull huts. I do not question its accuracy (what do I know about housing in the 12th century) but I think they tried to make a point a little too blatantly. Generally the sets were suitably epic for the events that took place.And we move on to the sound. The music was forgettable, the standard epic fare really and why all these movies insist on having a wailing woman as a part of the music I do not know (gladiator did the same I think). The battle noise seemed suitably chaotic with a healthy mixture of sounds piled on top of each other which I think worked well. It has of course been done before, but it has been done again and works well so deserves credit.Any compliments end there so if you liked the film, feel free to stop reading.Historical accuracy should not be taken too seriously since after all it is a film and should naturally be romanticised. However, I wish they would follow the line of Gladiator and distance themselves sufficiently from the real events so that their version doesn't clash with history. This film tries to be reasonably accurate with many of the characters involved yet it places the centrepiece on a Battle for a city which did not happen. It was also interesting how a film which prided itself on accuracy of warfare gave Saladin a few thousand giant trebuchets hurling fireballs. At the siege of Acre Richard the Lionheart had one and Philip Augustus had one and I think some other might have clubbed together for a third, but I am not sure. Siege warfare did not rest on breaches and flattening the whole city. This felt strangely like someone was trying to compete with Helm's Deep...Other things just did not work. The script writer must have thought he was very clever making the Franks call Saladin 'Sala-ah-din' at every opportunity. Surely it was the Franks who came up with Saladin because they did not feel like saying that and so they would have called him the wrong (by 21st century standards) version. Then there were the Templars. Why would Guy, an aristocrat with ambitions for the crown, become a monk, but they did not have to be complete villains. The film wanted villains though so Guy and the Templars had to take the fall. It was interesting how the King could get away with executing them and how the Hospitallers were their 'Good' alter egos.Then the low point was when modern sense of equality was added. Orlando Bloom alone realises that it is the workers and the average folk who do all the work and are the real heroes of society. So he casts aside the social barrier of knighthood, throwing it open to all and then puts the church in its place (the patriarch is after all a self seeking coward). This is after he digs irrigation canals for the suffering locals. Who do you want on your red flag, Lenin? Che? How about Balian! Anyway he was a hard working Stakhanovite with that hammer of his.This film is watchable but it helps if you have never and have no intention of picking up a history book in your life. It goes on to long and goes down in the list of failed epics but was not a complete disaster.So on my list of where I would consider watching it again (I have seen it already in cinema): Cinema - No Buying - No way Renting - No If a friend rented it - Maybe On a long plane journey - YES!",Kingdom of Heaven

I became interested in reading the message board comments because I wanted to know if others thought this movie was controversial in light of the current political and cultural conflicts in our world today. The Crusades were brutal,insidious, and horrifying and this movie depicts that brutality from all sides and all aspects. The acts of killing,maiming, and bloodletting were not one-sided. The most horrifying reality is that after all of these years.. man's inhumanity to man continues today... the weapons are more sophisticated...but, the hatred, bigotry and greed, and vindictive nature of man continues whether it is with weapons or in the ways people express their differences to each other on message boards.

Sure it isn't entirely accurate in accordance with what actually happened in history, but with that in mind, 'Do Not' go and see this movie and come back here to complain about how inaccurate it was. I've never once spoken to someone whose primary goal in a movie was to pick out what is possible, impossible, and incorrect.Ridley Scott has once again, in a fashion manner similar to Gladiator, re-created a masterfully picturesque film. What's not to like, great performances from both Liam Neeson and Jeremy Irons, not to mention Bloom in a bold return from his cowardly display in Troy. Eva Green and Ghassan Massoud, especially since this was their first big roles. Albeit long, this went in depth into the religious and political ideals of both Christians and Muslims. Other than the performances, Jerusalem as well as the other landscapes were visually mind-blowing! And most important of all, the message that the film sent... another reminder that it was not the Muslims who laid the blow, but the Christians.Overall another masterful piece of directing from Ridley Scott, Great performances and visuals abound. Once again, please don't go see the movie and come back to complain about history and script-related.

884,watkin-samuel,Good - But style over substance....?,7,8 May 2005,"Looks amazing but at the expense of the plot and character development (even if it is only entertainment). Above average but no Gladiator. Much better than Alexandria or Troy. Overall I was slightly disappointed after the excellent reviews in the UK press. I think the plot and script were quite superficial and any intrigue was very transparent with not much depth. At the beginning of the film we could have done with seeing the drama of Bloom's wife downfall and built up more empathy. Did this end up on the cutting room floor? I thought the love interest subplot did not deliver and was clichéd. Scott is a huge talent but I would like him to dig a bit deeper and add more depth and substance to his films, combined with his talent for cinematography he would then make some iconic films",Kingdom of Heaven

He died in 1341).I also think that the story-line lacks a story-line period. It reminded me of TROY. Whilist I loved Troy, I did get a bit bored with the fighting parts.I think it would have been interesting if in the film, the characters said ""oh blah blah to you Hospitaler (Teutonic Knights) and/or ""I am a Knight of Templar"".

This movie is absolute eye candy in every sense of the phrase. Orlando Bloom does a very good job of playing his first lead role. Despite what some may have said, there are some MAJOR differences between this movie and Gladiator. Firstly, this movie is an epic, whereas Gladiator was an epic tragedy. Secondly, one cannot compare the various roles throughout this movie to that of Gladiator because they are completely different roles, however similar they may be. When you see this movie, watch it with an open mind and try not to compare it to Gladiator. They are both awesome movies in very different ways. The only reason there is slight similarities is they both have a common director, so sure they will be slightly similar because a director has a certain style and to forsake that would be to forsake what makes his movies unique.

Orlando Bloom was wonderful and i thank Ridley Scott for his courage to put to the world what Muslims are about. Excellent epic movie for bother heroes (Lalian & Salahuddin).

I saw this movie because I've been in love with Ridley Scott's films ever since ""Alien"". I wasn't too fond of the script in some parts, but the controlled, skillful performances more than made up for it. Jeremy Irons and Liam Neeson were great in their supporting roles. In the lead, Orlando Bloom pleasantly surprised me in this movie. His performance wasn't ostentatious or loud, it was subtle, mature and nuanced for a young actor amidst celebrated veterans. I got a little teary eyed during the scene where Godfrey knights Balian, a wonderful dramatic moment. The action sequences were spectacular and notably intelligent. The climax of the siege of Jerusalem really stood out as the camera watches from above as Chistian and Muslim soldiers, stepping over blood-splattered flags and corpses, slaughter each other at the foot of the 'Kingdom of Heaven.' I felt dazed and saddened when I left the theater, but satisfied that I had seen a truly excellent film.",Kingdom of Heaven
889,schernoski,Uplifting,8,8 May 2005,"I am a history teacher and though I was aware historians were crying foul of the inaccuracies and I noticed many in the film, but despite these, I was very pleased with it. For me it is a ""feel good"" movie. I have to say that I tremendously admire Ridley Scott and the cast for making this film in these turbulent times. His point was to show (primarily the Western world) a little piece about the clashes between Islam and Christianity. And, be warned, this could cause tremendous animosity on all 3 sides: Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. Muslims could lament about the loss of Jerusalem and so could Christians. Jews could view it as an attack on Israel's power there. However, to the educated viewer, it does the exact opposite: It inspires. It shows the tremendous chivalry that existed between good men and shows you how the extremists ruined a lot and brought more death to innocents than did regular combat (true though most Crusaders were extremists and I doubt that there would have been so many rational ones, it is definitely ""updated"" for the 21st century). Scott shows you the parallels between a crazy Guy de Lusignan to a bin Laden or a neo-con. He portrays the de Lusignan as idiotic. He also tries to show you how blindly mad many of the Christian Crusaders were. He does this by having a man quote at the beginning (something along the lines of) ""It is not a sin to kill an infidel."" The viewer should make the bin Laden/ terrorist connection very early on. My opinion of this film was up for grabs until one of the last scenes where Balian and Saladin meet to discuss terms of surrender. Saladin promises that no one will be hurt and that they will all be allowed safe passage out of Jerusalem. Balian (Orlando Bloom) replies that when Christian crusaders took Jerusalem that they killed Muslims (and Jews) in great numbers, so how can I trust you? And at a point where I got goose bumps he replied (Something like) ""I am not them, I am Saladin Saladin."" Yes my friends for that moment CHIVALRY was ALIVE! This cemented my positive review of the film; it brought everything together nicely and I would have considered it a travesty had Scott left it out. True it was as rosy a peace as Scott makes it appear to be, (like the scene after Saladin walks in a Church in Jerusalem, he finds a fallen cross and picks it up. True a big embellishment, but an important scene as well). Scott is trying very hard to show that we can co-exist in this world. And because I am such an extreme moderate and as a teacher, one who emphasizes coexistence, the historical inaccuracies were fine for me to deal with. A great story (which I originally thought would be in the film) was the battles between Richard the Lionheart and Saladin. There was even more chivalry exemplified there, (though admittedly Saladin did poison the wells and raze the land to prevent Lionheart from advancing). This movie truly has the chance to inspire us all, and those moderates out there will be inspired and will be doing a lot of reading after this film. Religious extremists or People who think that other religions (and cultures) are inferior and should cease to exist will not like this film. The last line, ""Today, there is still fighting over the Kingdom of Heaven."" Now, many could be offended by that, but I let out a big, ""AMEN"" having just been to Israel and the West Bank last summer. Although I would have especially liked to see Scott present more of the languages difficulties here (all English, very little Arabic . . there would have been more complexities between communication between the Crusaders, etc) I am sure he did this to appeal to mass audiences and ease their understanding of it all. I applaud Ridley Scott (again) for being bold and trying to show us all that Religious and Ideological extremism (in all cultures) must be eliminated and goodwill and chivalry (though conflicts will persist) must be absolute.",Kingdom of Heaven

892,jpdunlap,"Movie is OK, it's attempt at fairness is flawed",6,8 May 2005,"The fact is, in these day and times it is very easy to point the finger at Islam and Muslims. Everyone is doing it pretty much. So for a movie to come out and be fair and balanced, it cannot pander to any audience even the slightest bit. While this movie could have been MUCH WORSE than what it was in the sense that it could have portrayed Islam in a very false light, -there is still a little bit of pandering to Christian audiences, and in so doing has, even if ever so slightly, betrayed history. I say this, however, with utmost respect for the director/writer because, while there is some pandering, there is also much fairness. In the end though, any knowledgeable Muslim will come away from the movie at least a little disgruntled.The reason being is because there are underlying themes that Salahaddin was a little bloodthirsty. -this is not true. Salahaddin was a man moved by his religion and faith to uphold justice and protect the weak. Granted the film tries to portray Salahaddin as someone who, on one hand has respect for Christianity as well as his enemy, it fails to portray him as someone who really wanted to look out for the well-being of the weak masses under his guardian-ship. The fact is little flaw can be found in Salahaddin's character historically, but the movie tries to find flaws that aren't there. For example, towards the end he threatens (or, rather, implies) that the Christian women and children in Jeruselem would be killed, an act which Salahaddin was never guilty of in his entire life, an act which his religion (Islam) strictly forbade, -but yet the movie seems to think there is some part of Salahaddin's character which would actually condone this, if even in an idle threat.The movie also shows Salahaddin catapulting fireballs at Jeruselem. One need not check the history books to see if this ever happened. Would Salahaddin really catapult large balls of fire, risking destroying Muslim holy sites in Jeruselem, including the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which is the spot the Prophet Muhammad (sws) ascended to heaven from? Would Salahaddin risk destroying churches despite the fact that this act is condemned by the Sahaba, such as Umar the 2nd Caliph and companion of the Prophet Muhammad (sws) who once learned of some Muslims who destroyed a church and built a mosque over it, and ordered them to go back, destroy the mosque, and rebuild the church? Destroying churches is clearly against Islamic idealogies and Salahaddin being a religious man would never have violated such a teaching. -Or what about the fact that the use of fire to kill your enemies is forbidden in Islam, as the Prophet Muhammad (sws) said, 'no one should use God's Punishment (I.E. Fire.)' -Are we to believe that the extremely religious Salahaddin just forgot this? What about the fact that in using fire catapults more civilians would be killed, which means that Salahaddin just allowed many Muslim, Christian and Jewish civilians to be killed, which would pretty much, according to Islamic philosophy, grant Salahaddin an express ticket to hell.In the end, the fact remains though, that even the writer could not completely betray history, and so gave Salahaddin a slightly compassionate side, therefore the above absurdities are mixed with scenes of Salahaddin offering his physician to the Christian King, granting safe passage of Christian civilians back to their homelands, and picking up a cross that had been knocked over and setting it back up in it's right position as a gesture of respect. This gives the audience the illusion that the film is completely fair and balanced, which it is not.A Muslim who goes to see this movie will walk away slightly offended, but realizing that it most certainly could have been much worse. And someone ignorant of the crusades, Salahaddin, Islam, etc will come away confused, wondering whether or not Islam is the bad boogie man it has been painted to be or not, finding little solace in the film for an answer. An Islamophobe who sees it will come out an Islamophobe, and a Muslim-sympathizer who goes to see it will come out a Muslim-sympathizer. Whether this is good or bad is up to the viewer, but personally a movie that told the complete truth and had a pair of balls would be a breath of fresh air...",Kingdom of Heaven

I was thrilled at this point to be viewing this place and as the movie progressed was treated with glorious vistas of the east. Not only was I impressed with attention to detail of armour, armouring and costume, I was delighted with the use of brass chain for the coife and camail of a couple of the actors ..a nice change, nice leather liners for helms, accurate use of the bassinet,swords,P of Sion detailing and symbols, authentic surcoat fabrics,pennant designs and footwear. Kingdom of Heaven was a feast for the eyes for the medieval buff. Full marks to the certain warrior portrayed in the initial battle scene, depicted as a Saxon type individual, stood out and deserves more attention for future movies...a firm and reliable accent with strong character. I understand that artists license must dictate to produce a commercially viable product and I willingly concede historical date inaccuracies on the part of the director without which the movie may not have been put together to provide the epic story. Oliver Bloom has come along way and no doubt will strengthen as time goes on. His role in this movie was to portray a young man from ordinary beginnings and he met this task without question. Loved Norton as the leper king. Most refreshing was Salahuddin (wonderful)as well as the other actors of the east, who thankfully were not white men dressed as easterners. Hope to see more of them.

The film is just plainly not that good. Visually it is magnificent to watch. There is no doubt as the Ridely Scott's directorial skill. What makes this film so mediocre is the fact that they have managed to make a politically correct film about the Crusades.

Let's face it, it wasn't a politically correct era... name one war that has been.There are no truly obvious ""bad guys"" and both sides have valid reasons for being there. I'm not saying that there needs to be a classic villain but what this film fails to do is allow its audience to engage with any of the characters. Add to this the single major military engagement is not even shown. Not that I'm bloodthirsty, it's simply that the film is building to this cataclysmic clash and it simply gets glossed over.At the end of it all, Kingdom of Heaven was beautifully shot and a visual feast but it was politically correct diatribe.

898,BinxBolling,A very bad movie.,1,9 May 2005,"""Kingdom of Heaven"" is an unusually bad movie -- boring, preachy, and revisionist. Lacking a protagonist with a sense of purpose and direction, the story wanders from one bloody event to another until suddenly Balian (the Orlando Bloom character) figures out that he's the defender of Jerusalem... for a time. Then he realizes he can't defend Jerusalem, and gives up.Since Ridley Scott obviously doesn't want to blame anything resembling modern Christianity -- or modern Islam -- for the pillaging and plundering that defined the medieval struggle for possession of the Holy Land, he makes the Templars into the bad guys. (Remember, the Templars don't exist anymore -- the Church made sure of that -- so they're fair game.) Balian himself, and all the other Crusaders, never claim to be fighting in the name of religion; in fact, they're so enlightened that they claim religion should have no bearing on the issue of the ownership of Jerusalem. ""Jerusalem belongs to everyone"" the movie sanctimoniously proclaims -- over and over -- as if Ridley Scott were not just a movie director, but an adviser to Kofi Annan.There's so much else that's awful about this movie -- the totally unconvincing (and unsexy) love story, the confused relationships between myriad undeveloped characters -- that I'd rather try to erase it from my memory than analyze it further. Spare yourself the pain; don't bother seeing it.",Kingdom of Heaven

It's almost comical. I kept thinking of the ""Black Knight"" sequence in ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail."" And mostly (at least, up until I left), the action sequences were manufactured. They didn't naturally flow from the prior events; rather, the story was changed (even to making it absurd) just to get that ""cool"" action sequence.2. Over the top evil characters. Yes, I'm sure there are a few people who cackle with ""oh, I'm sooooo evil!"" as they slaughter innocents, but that's not really the way things work.3. The acting. Orlando Bloom can't act. The ""evil"" characters couldn't act.4. The dialogue.

901,heyman_roosa,Balian exemplar of a 'perfect knight',10,9 May 2005,"The Holcombe-side my family, my great-grandmother is Mary Lee Holcombe, b. Exeter, Devonshire, England, our progenitor is the Crusader-Knight John Holcombe a Welshman who took up the Cross the Third Crusade was meritoriously knighted in Palestine for heroic action by King Richard the Lionhearted.""KINGDOM OF HEAVEN"" was like coming home to that historic period, above all others, I would chose to live. I enjoyed the movie--both its recreated historical aspects & its back-story of poetic license. Fascinated by stories of Knights & Knightly Quests, it is the character of Balian I identified with his quest to re-find GOD and in so doing his actions being the epitome of the 'perfect knight'. It is the example of THIS Balian, of the storyline, that we all must strive to achieve.A footnote regards the real historical BALIAN OF IBELIN: his father is Balian I--NOT Godfrey of the storyline--he is constable to the Count of Jaffa and in 1141 inherited the Castle of Yebna, from which his descendants took the Frenchfied name, IBELIN. Said Balian I married Helvis, daughter of Baudoin I, Lord of Rama. Their offspring are: Hughes d'Ibelin, Baudoin d'Ibelin, & BALIAN II D'IBELIN this is the Balian of Ibelin of the storyline ""KINGDOM OF HEAVEN"", Lord of Nablus, and Commander of Jerusalem, who really did surrender the City of Jerusalem to Saladin. He married Maria Komnenos, a Greek, the 2nd wife & widow of Amalric King of Jerusalem. From what I can ascertain, even though caught up in the factional rivalries of the Kingdom of Jerusalem just as portrayed by the movie, the real historical Balian of Ibelian was just as tolerant of Moslems, Jews, & others as the Balian portrayed in the storyline of ""THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN"". An example deserving our respect & emulation this day-and-age where the conflicts of Jerusalem are still in continuation.I recommend this movie for the ""ideal"" of a 'perfect knight' & of an exemplar of tolerance--and especially as a journey of spirituality a quest to re-find GOD a pilgrimage to take up the Cross of Christ. --Gregory Thompson,TO BE A KNIGHT!!!",Kingdom of Heaven

However, I had no idea how much I would LOVE the story it tells and some of the people it portrays. I had heard the hype that Christians and Molsems, alike, would be insulted AND upset by Kingdom, but nothing seems farther from the truth. Yes, the plot contains a few corrupt churchmen, as well as a handful of bloodthirsty, powerful Christians and Arabs who care about no one but themselves, and then, just as today, these types did, and do, exist. But they are not the focus of this tale. The message I heard loud and clear is one of tolerance, respect, and compassion for one's fellow human beings. This is a story of conscience and honor, of giving one's word and keeping one's promises. When the film ended, I wanted to stand up and CHEER for a film that shows us men (and women) more interested in others than in themselves. As a Christian who believes our world needs to be filled with tolerance and love and compassion for all people, I pray that our world can find leaders like Balian and Salah al Din.

It appeared dark almost all of the time like and old Martin Scorcese movie, and I really don't like this format. As to the movie itself I have watched many movies concerning the crusades and really expected a lot of what I had seen in the past. Having said that I was surprised and pleased that this was a more factual historical account about the mindsets, or attitudes of Christians and the church at the time of the crusades and really into at least the twentieth century, treatment of native Americans. I really liked bloom, yet was disappointed that Liam neeson wasn't around longer. The actor that portrayed Salidin was excellent and very real. I question the scene with bloom and the two Arab's and he killed the one who he believed to be the lord.

Forget the graceful epic of Gladiator, where transcontinental travels were delivered with panache, and actually believable. This movie throws scenes into a bucket and hopes we don't notice. Pretty lame.Bloom was somewhat miscast, and the actor playing ""Guy"" is straight from a cheap soap opera. Oh, and the theme song from another Ridley Scott movie ""Hannibal"", 'Vide Cor Meum' was pilfered from Hans Zimmer in this movie at the most inappropriate and noticeable moment. So much for John Williams on sound for this movie.

906,bdreem,Good adventure with a humane twist.,8,10 May 2005,"Let me start by saying that I find that Gladiator sucks big-time. It's a well crafted movie with a great cast which inexplicably manages to squander all its assets in the first third part. It turns to be as disgusting in the end as it was griping in the beginning...I don't pass such judgment lightly. I saw it in the theater, I own it in DVD and I have always followed Ridley Scott's career closely, ever since he made one of my all time favorite movies (Blade Runner). But I am sick and tired of the fascistic uber-mensch whose violent might conquers all that Hollywood keeps bringing forth by the dozen. We have enough gratuitous violence in real life as it is  real art should be rid of it.That said, I can tell my mind on KoH -- I find it a great movie.Sure, it has many flaws, both historical and artistic. Sure, the setting in motion of the plot (sudden gentrification by lost father, priest assassination and escapade to the Holy Land) is somewhat thin and rather more fit in a TV Soap than an epic. Sure, Orlando Bloom could have been surpassed in that role by another actor. Sure, the humanist load is somewhat overstressed. And I must add that I had trouble dealing with the Templar depicted as villains. But couldn't that be said of just any such movie? And should its achievement be marred by what could have been? That's how it was shown in this movie and the movie is good in spite of it But it was been a while since a hero has been portrayed in such humane light. It has been a while since combat has been straightforwardly shown as the butchery it really was at the times (and that it left piles of corpses to be disposed afterward). It has been a while since we have been reminded that the history of the West wasn't a crescendo of righteous victories. It has been a while since it has been stated that in the dark Middle Ages we westerners were the real barbarians while civilization, and magnificence, dwelt elsewhere (mainly with the Muslims...). That's how it is shown in the movie and the movie is better because of it A final word for Eva Green's remarkable impersonation of Sybilla: in an age when men and women lived mostly in separate worlds, how else could a romantic connection be forged but in passing contact, much anticipation and fortuitous encounters. And that's exactly how it is shown in the movie and the movie is great because of it.",Kingdom of Heaven
907,wwwooo,Good film with good messages,8,10 May 2005,"After reading the reviews of this movie, I was prepared not to like it and to be disappointed in Orlando Bloom's performance. I am glad I did go and I did like the movie. There is character growth and progression, it is subtle and moving. Bloom delivers a character interpretation that portrays quiet strength and determination. Just because he is not blustering about and shouting does not mean he is not portraying his character. Do all men stomp about and shout and grimace or do some act with dignity and are quiet leaders? This is a story for entertainment. But,there are insightful concepts in place. The most telling one is when the decent Saracen leader picks up the cross off the ground and places it back on the altar. Decent men on both sides of the issues, bad men on both sides of the issues. The acting in general is good. Liam Neeson and Jeremy Irons are very good. The photography is great. Better editing would have improved the film. It is a good film to enjoy just as a movie and it also reminds us that actions we take today can be far reaching and destructive into the future.",Kingdom of Heaven
908,pratha,"Such an important subject, such shallow characters !",5,11 May 2005,"The publicity for this film built up a such huge amount of anticipation and created such excitement from the opening shots only to allow those feelings to deteriorate into a big sense of disappointment post viewing and into the next day that I wondered why the great and gifted director Ridley Scott would allow some major blunders to mar this film and denigrate its potential status as one of the all time great films to another also-ran that will be probably only be remembered for its stupendous war and close fighting sequences and cinematic effects but nothing much else.Let me say that to misuse such a great cast was the 1st blunder. Certainly Orlando Bloom is a rising talent but he was quite out of his depths in a demanding lead role. It made me take my hats off to Russell Crowe in Scott's masterpiece, Gladiator. It was such a pity Scott did not have the foresight to cast Liam Neeson as Balian (the protagonist) instead, for he would have brought the much needed male bravado, machismo and screen presence that the role needed. Likewise Jeremy Irons was totally wasted as Tiberias, his superb depths as an actor hardly plumbed. Eva Green ? Such a raw young talent with those beautiful, luminous eyes deserved a bittier, sexier, more manipulating and emotional script than she got as Queen Sybilla, with much initial promise but little delivery. Only Edward Norton as the tortured King Baldwin and Ghassan Massoud as a superbly calculating Saladdin bring the depth and humanization to their complex characters and are indeed a pleasure to watch. Therein lies the major flaw of this movie : a weak script. I had no complaints with the cinematography or direction, superbly executed with cutting edge computer graphics and panoramic shooting sequences.It really did transport me to the Dark Ages in the Middle East. But why oh why did we not get the 3 dimensional characterization and depth of acting that this movie deserves ? Secondly , Scott blundered with a drawn out a middle section with much tedious repetition and inane dialog. The movie is about 20 minutes too long.The third great blunder was a terribly weak ending with too many loose ends. The historical setting and important subject matter of the Crusades are of such importance even today especially in Jerusalem, that most religiously sensitive holy City that Muslims, Christians and Jews alike will be viewing this film for a sense of historical accuracy and appropriate outcome without favoring either side. It does create some balance, especially in its sensitive portrayal of the predominately Muslim Saracen armies and their leader Saladdin who was a great historical figure, but I was left wondering, pondering what might have happened, feeling dis satisfied, not emotionally involved, un-fulfilled. Surely one of the aims of a great movie is to challenge the viewer emotionally and provide a tremendous sense of fulfillment when exiting the cinema. Sorry, did not happen.

Not only is it pretentious, it tries to be politically correct about a period of history that had no room for argument. I am no historian but let me assure you that the crusades took place in dark times where the lives of those who thought differently were not considered very valuable. The fact that a medieval king (wearing a ridiculous mask) upholds the ideal of a kingdom of heaven where Christian and Muslim live side by side (in the middle ages) is in my opinion an insult to the intelligence of the viewer.

Some movies that cover huge battles concentrate more on the battle scenes and not the characters. This movie also goes into great depth of the characters involved. The king, even though sick, has great dignity and strength. I think Orlando Bloom was an excellent portrayer of Balian. He brought across Balian's emotions, his morals, and his strengths so that the audience knows this was a valiant man. The battle scenes are incredible with fiery arrows flying through the dark, huge trebuchets slinging rocks, siege towers approaching the walls, and the men fighting for their beliefs. In history this was a bloody battle with the loss of many lives on both sides. I think this movie portrays that very realistically. The movie may not be 100% historically accurate, but it is close.

After spending some time in Tyre, he asked Saladin permission to travel to Jerusalem only to get his wife and he promised not to bear arms and spend only one night.When he arrived to Jerusalem, Balian begged Saladin to stay in Jerusalem to direct the resistance against him. Saladin agreed!!! How could that detail not have been included? The siege of Jerusalem lasted for 9 days - which is hardly a siege. The Orthodox and Jacobite Oriental Christians in Jerusalem wanted Saladin to take the city (they hated the crusaders because when they took the city the first time they killed all non-Europeans Jews, Muslims and Christians).During the negotiation Balian was desperate. He threatened in addition to burning all the holy site (mentioned in the movie) that he would kill all the their own women and children and the 5000 Muslim prisoners. So much for protector of the people.The movie grossly downplayed the Mercy of Saladin, and portrayed his goodness as a secular quality. Saladin let the king go free and all the European citizens of Jerusalem at a ridiculously low ransom. The citizens were allowed to sell their property before leaving. He even provided escorts for patriarchs who left with their riches and the riches of the church and the city. Saladins reasoning being ""We must apply the letter of the accords we have signed, so that no one will be able to accuse the believers of having violated their treaties"" - that is hardly secular.It is understandable that the movie directors want to make a point but Kingdom of Heaven twists history to make that point.

There was no ""spark"" between her and Orlando and thus what was the point? Why take so much time to worry about her ""cutting her hair?"" If she renounced her status, why reinstate her later on in a regal cloak, etc? The time spent on her could have been better spent on telling more of the ""real"" story. Saladin was well handled, well acted and, I believe, as fairly historical the only ""real"" part of the story.

920,vince-147,Flawed but fun (contains minor spoilers),8,16 May 2005,"The earlier review here is a fair overview of this film but it is still a movie with some major plot flaws. Despite the imposition on a medieval world of very modern PC attitudes, there is still a somewhat arrogant Western patronising approach to the natives of Palestine by our hero, Balian. The idea that the local farmers, whose ancestors had been farming the land for possibly thousands of years, did not consider the possibility of digging a well (and one only about six feet deep!) to acquire water is simply ludicrous. This film also demonstrates one or two of my other bugbears about errors in films set in medieval times. Commanders of archers shouting ""Fire!"" when they mean ""Release!"". ""Fire!"" would have meant nothing until the invention of the musket. I've also noticed that armour doesn't work in films. Swords or arrows go straight through every time and this film is no exception. Makes you wonder why they wear it. I also wondered why so many characters wear full combat armour whilst going about their daily business in peaceful Jerusalem or when eating dinner. Also we have morally upright Balian, usually concerned deeply with doing what is right, jumping into bed with a married queen with no ethical qualms whatsoever. It may be the morality of Hollywood, but it is both anachronistic and out of character in the context of this film. Balian's smithy seems to be miraculously rebuilt when he returns to France too. Despite these flaws it is still a glorious romp, with amazing sets and locations, and certainly made me want to go and find out the true stories of some of the characters depicted.

Ridley Scott is fair to the Muslims, and explores Balin's personal conflicts concerning his past sins and his quest for a better faith in God and true conscience. The supporting acting is great, as Jeremy Irons, Marton Csoakas, and Edward Norton give good performances to back up Bloom and Nielson. Jerusalem looks even better than the impressive CGI 'Troy' and Babylonia of 'Alexander'.

924,Troels_Bording,I really wanted to love this movie I really did.,2,19 May 2005,"But unfortunately I couldn't. Personally I have always been a fan of Ridley Scott and especially Gladiator and Black Hawk Down are among my favorites. Both were artistic and epic in their own way, and they really proved Ridley's talent as a director. So, even though I had been warned, I went to see Kingdom Of Heaven with high hopes.I was disappointed. For what it is worth, Kingdom Of Heaven is lacking. The plot is simply dull, which is surprising considering the topic and how it can be related to modern day events. The story is about a blacksmith named Balian (Orlando Bloom), who is encouraged by his father to travel to Jerusalem during the crusades, so that he may find god. Even though Balian never finds god, he still manages to become a knight, then moves on to become the first lover of Jerusalem, and ultimately ends up defending the city from an army of Muslims. The story moves at a slow pace and it relies heavily on the actors to carry it through all 145 minutes. Unfortunately, the actors aren't up to the task. Especially Bloom fails in his performance and his depiction of Balian is very forced. We never get the feeling that Balian is actually developing throughout the story, instead we see Bloom trying to force some kind of emotional turmoil on his character. He clearly needs more training as an actor, before he can take on another movie on this scale. As for the other actors well the movie focuses so much on Balian that all the other characters are all left under-developed, even though some of the actors actually do a good job. Especially Edward Norton made a fine performance as the leper king of Jerusalem.But aside from the actors, the movie suffers from others issues. The music is good but it lacks a central theme. Ridley should have kept Hans Zimmer for this one, who's earlier work include the soundtrack for Gladiator. The battle scenes are also amazing, but seem to borrow a lot from The Lord of the Rings (of course this doesn't really qualify as a criticism, it is just to say that we have seen it all before). But what it all boils down to is a slow paced 2 hour movie, with a lead actor who doesn't live up to his part.And that, my friend, ultimately ruins the experience.",Kingdom of Heaven
925,kosub,Almost as good as it gets.,8,17 May 2005,"Whatever else one can say about director Ridley Scott, from his roots in commercials to his more egregious missteps through the years (LEGEND, anyone?), he cannot be faulted for lack of ambition. Little by little, film-by-film, Scott has grown as a filmmaker. Whereas some directors are perfectly happy to create a niche for themselves and remain there, Scott has gone from the relatively quiet, self-contained THE DUELLISTS to such sprawling historical epics as GLADIATOR, and now KINGDOM OF HEAVEN.From the beginning of his career, Scott has been known as a master visual stylist. BLADE RUNNER remains the most influential film of the last thirty years. Coming on the heels of Peter Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS films, KINGDOM OF HEAVEN needs Scott's sure hand to make it stand out among such failed attempts as TROY and Alexander. The challenge was to make real settings and real people as compelling as the CGI-driven hordes of orcs and elves that drove RINGS audiences wild.Scott is up to the task. KINGDOM OF HEAVEN takes place in Jerusalem during the 12th century, between the Second and Third Crusades, a time when warfare involved huge bodies of men wearing armor and clashing on the battlefield where arrows fell like rain. The film is not short on combat, and when that combat gets going, it is as visceral as anything put to celluloid in recent memory.The real test of an epic film, however, is the human dimension. If Scott and his screenwriter, William Monahan, were less skilled than they are, KINGDOM OF HEAVEN would have fallen on its face, no matter the bravura of its battle sequences. What may on the face of it seem like a story about war is really a story about people, values and faith. To tell such a story, one needs REAL ACTORS. Scott's cast, which includes Orlando Bloom, Jeremy Irons and Liam Neeson, is uniformly excellent. Some like Alexander Siddig - his STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE days are, thankfully, long behind him - are SO good, one wishes they had more screen time. But even in a film that runs two and quarter hours, sacrifices must be made.KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is surprisingly meditative. Occasionally it overreaches, and strays into cliché when handling the necessary villains of the narrative, but the film has a deeper resonance than one would expect from a commercial movie. At times it is tempting to view KINGDOM OF HEAVEN as an indictment of Christianity, as the audience is given a few hissable moments featuring Christian clergy, but Scott and Monahan have crafted a story where the noble heart of faith and courage beats just beneath the surface of the plot.Scott has said that KINGDOM OF HEAVEN ran 80 minutes longer in its original cut, and that this footage would be restored in a DVD release. As good as the movie is in its theatrical truncation, it does sometimes have the feeling of an incomplete account. By the time the credits roll, the audience will certainly want to see more, to know more, to learn more. Certainly this was a case where breaking the three-hour running time barrier would not have been such a bad thing. On a cinematic landscape where FAUX epics abound, KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is the real thing.",Kingdom of Heaven
926,princess_piscesuk,and i thought troy was bad,1,17 May 2005,"This has to be one of the most horribly inaccurate piles of crap i've ever seen. It was dull, long winded, some god-awful performances (though i did like Ed Norton and Ghassan Massoud). Yet i have no idea how they could villify Guy to such an extent, the quote that Sybilla was forced to marry him when she was 15 is a load of utter rubbish. There is no mention of her son, Baldwin V, by her first husband or her daughters by Guy or even of her sister (who was a rival claiment after their brother died). The factor of her running off to France with that floppy haired bimbo was the last straw as she and her daughters died of a fever only a few years after the fall of Jerusalem. Oh god, i thought i could cope with the fictionalising of Troy to such a heavy extent but my god, i hated this movie. There is hardly anything good about it, i wasted hours of my life on this film and that gets me so angry.If you know anything about the crusades i really urge you not to see this film, but if you like long-winded dialogue, or are an Orlando Bloom groupie go and see this film. But Ridley Scott should be hung up for this, along with whoever did Troy. I just can't say enough bad things about this film and that rant on Sibylla was just the start, but if i write any more i'll end up giving people an unwanted history lesson, something that Ridley Scott desperately needs.",Kingdom of Heaven
927,tubaman-1,This is actually a good movie,10,26 May 2005,"OK, let's get this straight: Kingdom of Heaven is actually a good movie. I am not exactly sure why so many people are bashing it. It was not advertised as a historical documentary, so do not expect one. This is a MOVIE. If you want perfect historical accuracy watch the History Channel. If you want a well directed movie with a good story, good characters, and good battles, watch Kingdom of Heaven. In my opinion all the actors/ actresses did a fine job in their respective roles. I even thought Orlando Bloom did good in his leading role, and I had had doubts about his abilities. What I am trying to say is watch Kingdom of Heaven for what it is: an epic summer movie, not a historical documentary.",Kingdom of Heaven

929,sisterdew,LOTR2 with Christians and Muslims,3,19 May 2005,"Unlike other people at IMDb, I don't think Scott has portrayed the two religions in any deep way. It's an interesting story, the crusades, based on historical facts... It could have been such a good movie, but instead, the entire movie (save the first 10 minutes or so) is about fighting. I'll have to admit that a large part of the crusades was about fighting, but this is taking it too far. We barely get any background story about the religions themselves. Furthermore, Orlando Bloom, cute as he may be, does not play a very convincing knight (or a blacksmith, for that matter), the smooth baby-face ruins it all. On a more positive note: the scenery is magnificent! And there are a few actors whose performances were outstanding: Ghassan Massoud (Saladin), Jeremy Irons (Tiberias) and Liam Neeson did a wonderful job.Overall, I'd die a happy girl if I never have to see this disappointing copy of LOTR2 again.",Kingdom of Heaven
930,admissions-3,"Not bad, but needed better moral characters",6,20 May 2005,"I went to see this movie with the idea that it would just be another enormous saga with beautiful actors and lots of action. It was. I was rather disappointed how they portrayed most of the Christian characters. There were good Christian men during the crusades, but we were not shown who those men were. The action sequences were pretty amazing. You really felt as if you were standing right there in the middle of everything. Orlando Bloom did a wonderful job as a man, thrown into a destiny and fighting his own demons along the way. I did feel, however, that they needed to keep his new-found morals and values consistent throughout the movie, which they didn't. I'm not that familiar with the crusades and the movie, in itself, didn't shed much light on what was really going on and why the English were in Jerusalem in the first place. That would have been good dialog or description to have at the beginning. Overall, if you're not worried about a grand scale movie, then you should see this one. The scenery is beautiful and the action is quite good. The actors do a wonderful job portraying the people they're meant to and you really can see the struggle of conscience in each character as they decide what to do. The man who played the king also did a wonderful job. He was quite believable.",Kingdom of Heaven

932,prohibited-name-2411,ummm,8,21 May 2005,"I'd just like to disagree with the above comment because I loved the movie-- can't let the only one on here be negative... I found a couple inaccurate historical/religious/whatever details, but the movie was great. I think Bloom's character was meant to be melancholic (and virtuous, etc.) and non-zealous; his reasons for joining the crusades at all were the deaths of his wife and son. ""Sybilla"" may not have been so straightforward in 1184, but she remains only a princess and her husband takes the role of ruler when she is crowned queen. The actress herself did a fine job. I recommend this movie to anyone (especially quote lovers-- fill up the ""memorable quote"" section).",Kingdom of Heaven
933,alyaska,History can be confusing,7,22 May 2005,"From the historical point of view, the filmmakers and the writer have made no effort to inform the public that 1184 was between two crusades, the second and the third. Therefore, we are not really talking about crusaders, but as they mention from time to time in the movie, opportunists who traveled to the Holy Land seeking fortune and fame. Another point is quite important: the true goal of the Crusades was to reopen trade routes, not to reconquer Christian holy places. This explains the forts erected by the Templars and the Hospitaliers all along the coastline from Turkey to Egypt. Also, the leper king was in reality a very weak personality, unable to hold back the Christian fanatics, unable to stop the bloodshed, and Saladin felt that.Another weak point from the historical point of view is that the fervor of medieval Christians left nothing to envy to the Muslims. You gathered in church early morning to hear matins, you prayed at the Angelus, you went to confession every week and to Mass every Sunday. Bells were used to remind the Christian populations of prayer times, and in Jerusalem at the time, must have been competing with the calls of the mufti to prayer.Talking now about the movie: it is quite accurate, but still has the tendency to use shortcuts so common in Hollywood. At the end of the movie, the King of England (Richard the Lionheart) did not need to be told how to get to Jerusalem, he was the one who decided to embark in Messina. Most crusaders were actually going overland through Constantinople. The battles are also seen through the eyes of the camera: some battles could last for days, some sieges for months or even years. The movie functions as if all the action had taken place in a few weeks, when actually it would have been several years.Burning with the desire to show unparalleled valiance on the part of the knights, some scenes are simply not realistic unless some magic came to play. Once you have an arrow through your throat, chances are you cannot speak, breathe, let alone fight. A fighter on foot armed with a broad sword has also little chance of winning over a horseman with a lance, unless the said horseman is particularly clumsy. You find this kind of superhuman strength with the knights of the Round Table, but then we know that supernatural forces are at play.Finally, the dialogs are not very well written: they are in a very contemporary tone, lacking the courtesy and deference used in medieval times. The rousing speeches are not exactly rousing and some actors definitely need to work on their delivery. Martin Csonkas in Guy de Lusignan is as poker faced as he was in Celeborn in the Lord of the Rings. When you know that Lusignan was known for his tantrums, his screams, his abuse, Csonkas is not even close. Eva Green could also use more speech coaching. She mumbles a lot, to the point she is sometimes hard to understand. And Orlando Bloom? well, he is maturing, but not yet to the point where he has the screen presence that this movie required. Sometimes you get the feeling he is about to apologize for being on screen. But it is still a commendable performance from such a young elf, uh man, I mean.",Kingdom of Heaven
934,rje1-1,Review of KOH,4,25 May 2005,"Maybe I had too high of expectations for this movie. After all Scott's ""Gladiatior"" was a phenom. In addition I love epic historical films.In my opinion this movie was mediocre at best. Bloom didn't make a very believable warlord considering he was a lowly blacksmith a year earlier. The character Balian is way to far-fetched and I question if Russell Crowe could even have made him believable. I agree with other posters that the movie was choppy and left too many gaps.On the positive note the battle scenes had some originality and the panoramic shots were awesome. However weren't trebuchet used later in the middle ages? KOH was a mediocre film with some great fight and battle scenes. Wait for it on DVD and don't waste $10 to see it in the theatre.I hope this doesn't deter producers from filming more epic historical films. One in particular that I think would make an awesome movie would be the Battle of Hastings 1066. William the Conquerer played by Russell Crowe and Harold Godwinson played by Mel Gibson! That would make and epic for the ages!",Kingdom of Heaven
935,mrs-eomer,Read your history!,1,14 June 2005,"What a shame Ridley didn't just use the real historic tale. Its basically dumbed-down into a political statement with really incorrect content such as Greek fire being put out with water (!) and Templars being hung from the walls of Jerusalem. The historic content I agree would need to be 'enhanced' to make a good Hollywood movie, but not completely incorrect content used instead! I know such things as getting the Templar garbs wrong would only annoy a historian, but its little facts like these that can spoil an otherwise good film for many. It pains me to think that the general public might take this as a 'real' account of the Crusades - 'Heaven' forbid!",Kingdom of Heaven

From what I saw in the trailers, this looked like a pretty decent movie, good actors, director, topic, etc. But really, there was no depth to the characters, half the time I was trying to figure out who was who. Everyone looked the same, there was no real connection between any of the characters. There was also no motive, like why would Orlando Bloom's character want to defend everyone in Jerusalem? When did he learn all there is about war? Why? Why? Why? And really, they could have fit the whole movie into less than 2 hours.So, in conclusion, I would skip this movie if I were you. The only thing I actually thought was pretty decent was the soundtrack and topic. The movie just needs to be tighter...",Kingdom of Heaven
937,nash-27,An attempt to acknowledge a flawed military adventure,5,27 May 2005,"Kingdom of heaven is a modernised romantic-liberal fantasy about the crusades, stuffed with some of the silliest supporting performances imaginable in which a young blacksmith from the 12th century France finds himself joining the cause, not for the glory of battle or the honour of restoring Christian mastery in the Holy Land but aiming to broker peace between Muslims and Christians.Bloom plays the humble yet hunky blacksmith Balian, modelling a range of close-fitting jerkins, in mourning for his wife who has committed suicide after the death of their child. On his way to the holy land, the boy becomes a man. he turns into a knight, a brilliant military tactician(somehow), a lover and a visionary of peace. The chief baddie is Sir Guy De Lusignan, played by Marton Csokas - who is the campest villain I've ever seen in a long time, always sneering and pouting and arching his body into all manner of haughty catlike postures. Sir guy owes his eminence to the fact that the peace-loving king Baldwin is married to sir guy's sister Sibylla played by Eva Green. Sibylla is enraptured by the handsome and noble Balian, and she is forever galloping in and out of courtyards and unwrapping her headscarf to reveal pedantically exotic makeup and jewellery. She favours bloom with a bewitching smile of inexpressibly sensuous anticipation, like a mysterious princess who's about to get stuck into a bar of fry's Turkish delight.Once the battle starts, culminating in a massive siege of Jerusalem with zillions of pixellated soldiers massing on a computer generated plain, then at least we get the impression of something happening. The movie is an attempt to acknowledge a flawed military adventure but fundamentally hamstrung by a deep reluctance to make our heroes look bad. Muslim audiences might well have mixed feelings about this fictional crusader, congratulating himself on doing the right thing at all times.",Kingdom of Heaven

More over we're attacked by the information so that our senses aren't so sharp like in past. And now and then we could miss any miracle unfortunately but sometimes we're shocked by the piece of art. This piece was a film for me that is called ""Kingdom of Heaven"" by Ridley Scott. It is story about one young man who is involved in facts of crusader's invasion in Jerusalem. I've been impressed by the way of director's seeing that time. This epic narration is full of racy landscapes and gorgeous costumes. You feel like you were there: waded cross the dessert, fight with Muslims and bravely defended the Justice. When I'm watching this film I'm thinking of our citizens. People go to work in a buses or in a cars, they do some activities, they eat, talk each other, make money, spend money and go back home. Even if I see their rare smiling, it will just like a little spark. They haven't got a passion. They have forgotten the taste of life. Colors became grey and we are losing divine Providence.

It could have been just the way the script was written of the way the director wanted it. I am making excuses for him because he usually more dynamic.

Now it seems he has matured. The cast is one of the best ever like Neeson playing Godfrey, Irons playing Tiberias, and Gleeson playing Reynald. A character which I really liked was King Baldwin played by Edward Norton for hes a king with love for his people but when he is mad you better not get in his way.The siege however is one of the most visually excellent of scenes you will ever see.

A director that I admire (nearly all of his work before Hannibal), Good cast, great period in history to make a film about. Indeed it has it's good points some actor deliver good performances, Liam Neeson, Jeremy Irons and Edward Norton - Also thought the guy who played Saladin was good too. But you don't see enough of any of them. Instead there is too much focus on Orlando Bloom - who does not effective as a lead man in this film. I thought he was good in Lord of the Rings but in this film he seems to lack and charisma gravitas and charisma of the kind that you would get from other lead men in historical pictures like Mel Gibson, Kirk Douglas, Russell Crowe, Charlton Heston, Richard Burton or even Brad Pitt. You don't believe that he could lead/inspire men to battle or is as good a fighter as he is portrayed in the film.Historically - The film is somewhat inaccurate. I am not picking up events as such, rather the motivation(s)of the Templars - This whole stupid notion 'defending the people' which seems to crop up a lot in the film seems rather out of place when Templars were adventurers out for profit. Whole film feels like a rather ham fisted attempt to transpose moderns values to past situations.

947,tlansink,"Never reaches any great heights, but a very nice film after all.",8,15 June 2005,"I think there are many people who expected too much of Kingdom Of Heaven before they even saw it and thereby were let down by it in the end. This however is no reason to say it was a bad film. Having seen it in the cinemas and without any great expectations, it was quite a good film. The film has its weaknesses, of course. The choice to cast Orlando Bloom to play the main character proves not to be the best. I'm not saying that Bloom's a bad actor, I'll leave that open. What I ám saying is that Bloom plays his films like he plays a role in a theater production. This way of acting works superbly for films like The Lord Of The Rings, which is a fantasy-film. For Alexander though, which tries to tell its story realistically and is also filmed that way, it basically means that the actor, in this case the main character, doesn't quite fit in. Though the story might lift some eyebrows here and there, Kingdom Of Heaven offers a realistic view on a very plausible crusade, and what's more, focuses on the ethics behind war and, in this case, the crusades. Of course there were those who went on their mission to fight and conquer Jerusalem, but Scott's story is just as believable and far more charming.In the end, Scott offers a very nice alternative to the standard medieval-war-formula-film with his Kingdom Of Heaven. The film doesn't reach any great heights, partly because its main character doesn't always convince, it does manage to enchant from to time and makes one leave the film not with a load of adrenaline pumping through ones body, but rather with a question in ones mind, which may very well be a good thing these days.",Kingdom of Heaven
948,abdulkarim1998,"A great film, highly entertaining, a classic.",10,19 June 2005,"I think the Kingdom of Heaven is a masterpiece. It is one of those rare films where all the skills of movie making are perfected. The acting, the costumes, the directing and the scenes are all wonderfully played and made. The battles are so epic and the music so moving.I think the art of movie making is perfected when one forgets that he or she is in a movie theatre. Rather the film manages, at least in my case in taking you back to those days where the realties of life were so harsh. You can not help but feel it.Some viewers were critical of the story but then I think stories especially historical are the domain of books not cinemas. If one wants a true account of the Crusade then he should be prepared to spend an entire lifetime reading about it. There are literally hundreds if not thousands of books on the subject. A film can not possibly condense that all in 2 hours or so.It is also not fair to judge the film by the accuracy of its historical facts. First of all historians themselves rarely agree. Secondly, we must not forget that this is a film made to entertain rather than to educate. How for example, can a person with a face so deformed by leprosy write, walk, ride horses and even wipe a man? Such a sufferer would be probably have gone blind and with hands and legs so deformed to be of any use. So we must not forget that we are in the cinema not a university lecture hall.Having said that the fact remains that the film has a credible story behind it. The crusades did take place and those epic battles in the film did occur in one form or another. I could not however, and in spite of being both an Arab and a Muslim help but feel that the film was biased against the Christians. But then European historians have long ceased to defend the Crusaders or their mission. In fact, many are as critical of it as Arab historians are. That is not surprising knowing that the Crusades were really started by a Pope in his desire to gain ground over a rival. It was fuelled by a religious establishment so corrupt and at times was even headed by atheists. An establishment so cruel that it even sent children to certain death in the Children Crusade.One of the few weaknesses of the film though I thought was its choice of words such as ""You are walking. Queens do not walk"" But then there were remarkable ones like when Balian says regarding being a knight ""neither earned nor proved"". I thought this was great.A great film not to be missed.",Kingdom of Heaven
949,Anarina,"""Kingdom"" begs audience to self-analyze",8,18 June 2005,"Warning: this does not have any overt spoilers, but if you read it and then watch the film, you might realize what I was referring to as it happens. :) The movie was good. It's not exactly what I was expecting. I knew it was going to be about the Crusades, but I was expecting a lot more story and much fewer battle sequences. If you're squeamish in the least bit, don't put yourself through this movie. It is rated R for violence and some other stuff, and there are certainly enough flesh wounds to make any non-nursing student uncomfortable. While I'm talking about the battles, there was one part in particular that was far too reminiscent of another Orlando Bloom movie. (Watch the battle at Minas Tirith in Return of the King and compare them yourself if you don't believe me.) There was a good use of slow motion in the movie--only used once or twice to add good emphasis. It was a visually pleasing film--minus the goriness, or plus the goriness if that's what pleases you. The colors and textures of the film were delightful eye candy in my opinion.About the movie's content...It was very thought-provoking. As it centered on holy wars, it made me think about religion, faith, and what God expects from us. I appreciated the take that the director took on religion. He did not present either Christianity or Islam as bad, but he pointed out positive and negative aspects of both religions. When I say ""religion"" here, I am not referring to personal faith, but more of an institution. There were a few inconsistencies in the message of the film. One of the characters refers to Jerusalem as being a ""kingdom of conscience."" Later, another character refers back to this when faced with an ethical dilemma. Unfortunately, he had previously slept with another man's wife, so it really under rides his ""righteousness"" if I might put it that way.Overall, I would recommend this film. It makes you think, but it's not an unpleasant journey to take. Also, if you appreciate middle-eastern culture or the middle ages, this movie is tailor-made for you as it contains both.

They could have said 'God wants this', 'God desires this' etc,etc. but everyone said the exact same phrase for the same meaning and it was a bit annoying. The script writer had good phrase choices but there were awkward moments where, for example, the main character is in the middle of nowhere surrounded by walls sitting by a tree...Where did the walls come from, where is this, and how did people know that they can find him there?

953,manzarhabib,An excellent depiction of historic events.,10,29 June 2005,"Ridley Scott, once again proved that he knows what he is talking about. The movie is amazingly gripping. The graphics, set, costumes, characters, everything is perfect. The storyboard is amazingly balanced with the timing. The script is simply breath taking. The armies have been greatly setup. However the movie is bit slow for the genre but one will not move his eyes from screen.On top of everything, the beauty of the movie is, all the characters being played by area specific actors. Such as Saladin was Played by an Arab actor and Even Green being french and the list goes on that makes the movie even more beautiful.This is not a typically Hollywood movie. The movie depicts amazingly true historic events in which the Muslims have been shown victors.Some of the drawbacks of the movie are, the main character of crusades Sultan Salah-ud-din has not been shown more, neither his script justified with the personality of actual Sultan. The prayers scene in Jerusalem have been misinterpreted as they have shown Muslims praying far from each other, where Muslims pray shoulder to shoulder. The character of Balian and the story of holding defenses of Jerusalem cannot be found in History.

However, this should be a foregone conclusion for any rational human being walking into a movie theatre. I didn't watch this movie to learn something about history.People complain that perhaps the main character was not a blacksmith. He wasn't. I don't think Ridley Scott is seriously arguing that he was. The ""simple blacksmith"" was probably a tool representing the piety and simplicity of intention on the main character. But we live in a world where people don't think five seconds about anything. Anything abstract is automatically pretentious. If someone claims something is an abstraction, then they are lying or they have an agenda. Guess what people, abstractions are necessary in art. Art is abstraction.I enjoyed this movie. It was a good movie. Good production, the love story wasn't too over-the-top, good acting, great action. And for me personally I like the agnostic twist (virtually anti-religion) at the end.

Lepers are like monkeys...there should be more of them in movies :D And apparently my comments are not long enough. Well, the sex scene was pathetic. If Orlando Bloom is going to do the nasty, I want more nasty! I mean, he's not a great actor, but I imagine his tush could be quite the spirited orator.

There is a lot of blood which is probably the cause for the R rating. Language is not really of a problem. Also, there is some parts in which they are confusing. For example, the two armies for Jerusleum. Some of this you would need to know the history prior to watching. The acting was not bad though, it was the story plot that seemed to kill the movie.

With those 45 minutes included, this film is a gripping epic with some great cinematography and some really good acting (well, Orlando Bloom is serviceable at best but there is great cast of supporting characters; most notably Edward Norton that delivers an impressive body and voice performance as the always face-covered Leper King).Second: Renounce any historical accuracy.

963,slyztercore,a true masterpiece that have many message,10,25 May 2016,"well, i extremely rare to write a review..but then after watching this director cut worth 3 hour++ i feel like to make some comment. firstly yeah iam a Muslim whose some of you guys think bad. but the truth is the bad Muslim is not religion itself but the person. as in this film story. what got my attention is how they view Islam in this movie. rarely Hollywood movie Islam guy as nice and moderate guys. mostly i watch that Muslim leader is a blood hunger killing men woman and child. so what catch my attention is how they accept the salahuddin fact on how he act of kindness on their enemy. iam not saying that all Muslim leader before is good. when a kingdom rise there will be a downfall. same as Islam kingdom, there have been a proof where hundred year of ruling a kingdom make slowly they Islam kingdom fall to become bride and power hunger. this also happen to Christian, this what the movie show, is not only Islam but Christian also the same. hundred years of ruling then someday will come the fall. where everyone hunger for power and fight among them self resulting to loss to enemy.This is what i exactly in my view, most Hollywood movie will only make Islam as bad person and view Christian as good. but in reality both has a downfall. but bear in mind that downfall not come from religion itself but from a man that hunger for power and use religion as excuse. what make me satisfied about salahuddin is how they show he give mercy to surrender survivor, and how he respect other religion. you can see that he pick up the cross that have fallen, and he avoid from stepping the cross sign. this is exactly how our religion (Islam) is promoting. respect other religion. that what exactly what salahuddin do. and when he answer jurusalem worth nothing, everything. it means thousand word. for both jews, Christian, Muslim jurusalem is a holy place. but the truth is it has nothing. it only in the middle of sand that why its nothing. but its everything worth fighting for that is because is the holy land.its maybe has nothing but its have everything. that why the crusader at last scene travel to jurusalem to claim. because its everything for jews, Christian and Muslim.lastly come to my 1st point, some Christian will telling that this movie is awful. they only show the bad side of Christian, but sometimes you gotta admit it, there also the time dark age where that time people abuse religion to their suit. but look at the bright side while maybe ballian not a loyal to Christian but he do believe in god earlier and want to go to jurusalem to repent for his crime and her wife. while he gave up his life then come the light. and the last conversation that he get is why he get all that experience if no god to help him. and then this view that religion is not at fault but the person does, why the bishop and priest view as not good person. the same can be view from the salahuddin adviser which he really want a war to get jurusalem while salahuddin still want peace negotiation. you can see that salahuddin adviser really happy when they war with Christian. while salahuddin himself respect the jurusalem king earlier. this is the message that this movie to deliver, the religion is not at fault for a person actand sorry for my bad English",Kingdom of Heaven

I am so glad that I did. The scenic shots were amazing and the battle scenes were breathtaking. The story line was enjoyable however I feel that it got very convoluted and extremely difficult to follow about half way in. For example You have no idea what condition causes the king of Israels problems until you are almost done watching the movie. Nothing was added to the film by keeping that from the audience except that it leaves the audience in confusion for many parts of the movie. The plot was a little too complicated. Maybe it was just me but I feel like the movie jumped around in terms of focus way to often and with too much intensity. Besides those points the film was enjoyable. As an audience member you really begin to take the side of the protagonist even when you sometimes feel like you do not need to.

Beside that the story is not 100% exact ( but hey what story is).A will list them here:I understand that in a Hollywood movies the Muslims talk English. But sometime they do talk Arabic. So when talking to the Christian they speak English but why don't they speak Arabic between them. There is a scene when Saladin speaks to one of his generals the whole discussion is in English??It's a strong image when the Muslim army pray together before Jeruzalem. But hey Muslims don't prey toward Jeruzalem but toward Mecca which is in the opposite direction.When the Muslim bury the corps, Saladin prays. A soerat from the Kuran.

They appeared to be the anti-thesis of of what the Templars really were said to be in most of the scholarly accounts of their actions during the Crusades (e.g. ""Dungeon, Fire & Sword"" as one of the best books on the history of the Knights Templar).Most period pieces tend to paint the Templars in black or white, with little variance in between. I was saddened to see that they were portrayed as ruthless, bloodthirsty, amoral murderers. The reality of their character was quite different and very complex in that they acted often as ambassadors and negotiators during the Crusades. They were thought highly of by the Muslim warriors leaders due to their fierce method of warmaking, their mercy towards those captured in battle and even adopting the, then, uncommon practice of wearing beards (which was all but unheard of amongst the European crusaders.) The Templars in any movie are a lightning rod and it was disappointing to see how negatively they were portrayed.",Kingdom of Heaven

The movie doesn't attempt to explore their doubts but just leave them be. Furthermore it portrays Christians as religious fanatics and Muslims as much more peaceful than what is historically accurate. In fact, this movie strays so far from real history that it disappoints me how Hollywood is full of people who have jumped on the left-wing bandwagon. They twist the truth in order to appeal to generation snowflake. These people and mainstream media are a major part of the reasons why so many young people have been brainwashed.

I got it all wrong. Well, besides the blood. In the past ten years, our world has turned into black and white. Good and Bad. Upfront declared villains and heroes. In this mess, we all became a bit fanatic and radical. We even forgot what really matters in this world. This movie is the most violent peace making movie I've seen in a long time.

Kingdom of Heaven is yet another Ridley Scott epic and a very good one at that. I have no issues with the movie overall except for some of the Arabic dialogue that permeates the movie. Some of the pronunciations, words, accents, and intonations of the Arabic dialogue were atrocious and even funny. In fact, in one segment, Sybilla (Eva Green) says ""Good Morning"" in Arabic but it sounded so bad that in Arabic it meant something very different; An insult, in fact that is just too rude to write in here. Many other examples in the movie, of bad pronunciation and intonation of Arabic dialogue were just plain hilarious and off the mark. I could also detect several Arabic dialects through out the movie. Arabic intonation, dialogue, and pronunciation differ in various Arabic nations and I could hear words and expressions in Egyptian, Palestinian, Lebanese, and Gulf States Arabic.The Arabic in the movie should be uniform throughout. To most non-Arabic speakers these errors would go by unnoticed. I was just flabbergasted that a huge movie like this will have these easily noted errors. All it will have taken is to have an Arab linguist go through the movie and fix things up. I am just surprised that these errors slipped through.

972,iamin,What a true knight should be and the closest thing to real history,10,14 October 2005,"I loved the movie. The action in this movie was amazing. One thing that I really liked was that they showed there are good people who are trying to make this world in a better place, like Balion, Tiberias, King Baldwin, and there are people who are trying to start a war. There are fanatics everywhere in this world.When Orlando Bloom charges against the Muslim army with only his small army at Krek, that was a really amazing scene. That is how a true, brave knight should be. That is a how a true human being should be, to fight and protect the innocent.The Muslim roles were done really well may be because they were done by actual Muslims. I thought the role of Saladin was the best one, done brilliantly by Ghassan Massoud.The roles of the Christians were done really good too. Liam Nesson, Martin Csokas, Jeremy Irons, Brendon Gleeson - everyone was amazing. But for some reason I thought the role of Balian could have been played by someone like Mel Gibson or Russell Crowe.Finally, I liked it because it was the closest thing to true history (mind you, I said ""closest"") about Crusades, capture of Jerusalem and Saladin that Hollywood has ever produced .",Kingdom of Heaven

No, it is not completely historically accurate, but I do not think that the directorial/screenwriter license taken adversely impacts the overall messages. What I do think is unfortunate is the disparity between the theatrical release and the director's cut.
In the original release I found the character interaction and the general flow of the story, prior to Balian's arrival in Jerusalem to be a bit confusing. Likewise, the relationship between Balian and Sybilla seemed to be missing important detail. All of this is made clear in the director's cut version.

976,szeeshanrizvi,An Epic Par Excellence,10,23 October 2005,"One of the Best Epics I've Seen! 7 Stars to it. I think Ridley Scott has surprisingly struck us all. After having seen Gladiator, obviously we were in no doubt of his production qualities, but the historical truth that the movie portrays, and the generosity in depicting the exact account of history has really pleased me. As history is witness, fanatics have been on both sides, in fact on every side of the fence. Such minority never represents the whole stature of any religion in most of the cases. KOH maintains this truth and shows both the good Christian (Bloom) and the converse. Religious activities, prayers, accents and the military strategy of the Muslim army has almost, if not completely, been flawless, which is not the case usually. Saladin's discipline and integrity for which his name lives to date is shown to almost an accuracy. Although i would have liked to see both Bloom and Ghassan with more flaming speeches and majesty, specially Saladin, as history has penned. The end sequence depicting the entrance of Saladin in Jerusalem with the Arabic Background song, when he lifts his head to see the Hilal (Islamic emblem of Cresent) posted on the minaret and when he finds a Cross lying on the floor and picks it up with honor and places it on the table was excellent. It portrayed the honor of a dignified man. It was these little details of truth which are usually a scarcity in most Hollywood movies.The surrender at the end was a bit awkward though. Orlando Bloom was a brave man but his statement to Saladin saying:"" You'll destroy your army here and never raise another. I swear to God that to Take this city will be the end of you""And on the very next sentence, agreeing for terms, and surrendering the city was a bit inappropriate.But nevertheless, the characters were well catered. All in all, an epic par excellence. If anyone thought Scott could not level Gladiator again, he was wrong!

The story compressed the real lives of a handful of people living over about 25 years into a single winter and did it beautifully. The subject matter was truly challenging and I salute Ridley Scott for choosing it. I know in encouraged me to look at the historical context. Orlando Bloom did a fine job in the title role as the reluctant hero. His performance is believable because he is not a commanding presence such as Russell Crowe, in Gladiator.

Yes, the fighting was brutal, on both sides. But this was typical of the age and not out of the ordinary. This nothing more than a bunch of PC crap.

980,montague123,room for improvement,6,6 May 2006,"On the whole I thought this was a reasonably good film, but it clearly could have been so much better. It mainly suffers from trying to cram too much into the story and consequently many of the plot lines are underdeveloped and come across as rather ludicrous. For example Orlando Bloom's character, Balian, and his relationship with the King of Jerusalem; The King decides he would like Balian to be his successor to the throne  why? Because he's just foolishly risked the lives of his men by charging a whole army with his band of knights? Impetuous youth is hardly the makings of a future king. Balian's sense of nobility and his idea of the 'perfect knight' started as a commendable cause but I found his character becoming more dislikeable throughout the film. Why would he not accept the throne of Jerusalem (and save the lives of thousands of people by maintaining peace with Saladin)? Because it would not be Christian to kill the evil Guy de Lusignan? Yet it was still OK to sleep with another man's wife (Sibylla)? His over-inflated hero persona really got to me by the end of the film. Many critics have had a go at Orlando Bloom for the way he handled the lead role in this film, though I think he is merely struggling with a poorly developed character. I did find his stone-faced acting rather inappropriate at numerous points, particularly the rather flat delivery of his morale-boosting speeches during the siege of Jerusalem.Besides Orlando Bloom, the calibre of acting is however very high. Jeremy Irons delivers a strong performance as the King's adviser and Marton Csokas and Brendan Gleeson are especially charismatic in their roles as the warmongering Knight's Templar. I also particularly enjoyed Edward Norton as the leprous King. Despite acting from behind a mask, the tones in which he delivers his part added immense gravity every scene he was in.The myriad of historical inaccuracies that surround this film are not something that particularly bothers me. I watch movies to be entertained, not for a history lesson. Besides, it's only meant to be BASED on history, it doesn't have to include every last detail. The licence to be creative with a script is what makes a good film, take Braveheart for example. This story of William Wallace is a million miles from reality, yet it still makes for a great film. One of things I thought Kingdom of Heaven handled quite well was the nature of religion. Whilst nearly all the religious characters are 'bad guys' in some way, this clearly isn't meant to represent the actual state of Christianity and Islam at the time of the Crusades. It does however serve as a contemporary warning against the dangers of religious fanaticism.The battle scenes are the main thing that saves this movie and overall I found the film quite enjoyable. However, I felt the story is badly underdeveloped and by the end of the film I had little concern for the fate of Balian or Sybilla. Both characters could have had much more depth and had the film been allowed more time, some of the plot-holes might have been resolved. I personally would have much rather sat through a 3 hour version of this film if the story could have had a greater impact. As it is however, the film takes on too much in too short a time and so its conclusion falls rather flat.",Kingdom of Heaven

983,sebhorse,"""Lord of the Rings"" this isn't.",5,4 December 2005,"People continue to compare this movie to other movies with character development and plot interspersed between the fight scenes, like ""Gladiator"" and ""Lord of the Rings."" This movie is none of them. Personally, I thought Orlando Bloom's acting was the best he's ever done. He changes facial expressions and everything. If this was a better movie, I might have even identified with his character. But it wasn't. First, the directing and the script are both not the level I was expecting them to be. In a scene where Balian is almost assassinated, I almost fell asleep--not a sign of a brilliant movie. There was almost no character development of any of the characters in the movie, which certainly would have helped. The acting (Jeremy Irons, Liam Neeson, Edward Norton, Ghassan Massoud, etc.) was amazing, but that didn't help the lack of overall plot. The movie seemed to be more concerned with showing us Orlando Bloom than with maintaining a story.And, while I can sit through many other long movies with little dialogue and enjoy them (such as Lost in Translation), this is not one of them either. There is no overriding plot that goes throughout the movie. I spent two and a half hours waiting for something to happen, Saladin attacked Jerusalem, and the movie ended. Many of the character's actions seemed to have no purpose. (In particular, one random scene that seemed to be inserted for the sole purpose of showing Orlando Bloom shirtless. At least in Troy, the lack of clothing pretended to have a point.) Third, historical accuracy. Let's pretend that once upon a time, the Crusades actually happened. While Saladin gives a speech similar to a speech that the real Saladin gave, that's about where the similarities end. Illegitimate sons did not usually become buddies with the king of Jerusalem. The character of Balian is a bizarre mix of Balian of Ibelin, who married King Baldwin IV's stepmother, Balian's brother Baldwin, and a Hollywood fantasy of the ""perfect knight"". And the doctor who diagnoses Balian's father's injuries had medical knowledge that did not exist until after the Middle Ages. While some historical inaccuracy in the name of plot is acceptable, juxtaposition of several different crusaders and the Renaissance for the sake of a better story is not. I would have hated this movie if not for two things: the amazing acting in the face of a hostile script, and the underlying questions in the script. Both the Christians and the Muslims are treated fairly are portrayed with a heroes-to-villains ratio similar to that during the real crusades, unlike older movies about the Crusades (although, in real life, there were some Knights Templar who weren't evil). When Balian asks Saladin what Jerusalem is worth, Saladin replies, ""Nothing...Everything!"" The movie seems to be asking the same question.",Kingdom of Heaven
984,togoit123,A Nice Movie Although It Is Quite Puzzling,1,10 December 2005,"That movie definitely had some amazing scenes and cool graphics. However, I found it hard to keep up with a plot. I guess that if I had read the book on which that movie is based, I would have comprehended more. OK, now we have to have 10 lines. I don't feel like typing 10 lines... Why can't we just type 2 lines and be done. This is such a strange rule. I really don't see any reason for it. Readers should enjoy reading short reviews rather than long and monotonous, and endless lines. The good review might me short as ""a"". One intelligent word may substitute for the thousands and thousands of passages. We love you and God and we shall come.",Kingdom of Heaven

986,tan_books,A Very Enjoyable and Satisfying Movie!,10,31 December 2005,"Take away the bias that the movie had facts mixed with fiction. Take away the minor historical inaccuracies. What does that leave you? A very enjoyable movie that will leave a wonderful lingering feeling hours after you watched the movie. And this is a movie that will keep on playing in your mind over and over, and make you relish some memorable scenes. While this is still not on the same caliber as Gladiator, it is still an absorbing movie that will take you back in time and leave you wanting more.The shots are spectacular, and the actors are really great! Liam Neeson, Jeremy Irons, Edward Norton, and Ghassan Maussod all deliver great performances! And I had to say even Orlando Bloom had done an acceptable job acting in this movie. I actually put-off watching the movie because I don't really like Orlando, but this movie will make you love him and cheer him on! Maybe I was able to enjoy this so much because I had such low expectations. I did not expect it to be that good. Before watching this movie, I did not even know what the story was about, or even the gist of it. Maybe in the future I should do less checking before watching movies.",Kingdom of Heaven
987,monelunix,See the Director's Cut on DVD,9,6 August 2006,"The Director's Cut version out on DVD is almost a different movie. The excessive length caused the studio to ask it be cut. This resulted in a version with more focus on Orlando Bloom's character. This was the major complaint from the critics, i.e. that Orlando Blooom as an actor couldn't carry the movie.Well I personally think he did a fair job of it, but he never was intended to in Ridley Scott's vision. By cutting the other story lines and sub-plots they ended up with a movie that appears to be about the character Balian.Either version is worth seeing.",Kingdom of Heaven
988,fallenangelq23,Kingdom of Heaven : washing your socks would be a funnier way to kill time,4,21 January 2006,"I just finished watching this movie and I almost feel like I have wasted the past 132 minutes. The story had potential and no doubt it had a great budget but it was lacking very important elements.The beginning of the movie was very similar to ""Gladiator"", the observer was quickly thrown into bloodshed and death and here it was, unlike ""Gladiator"", very confusing. The start was a bit hectic and superficial. Orlando Bloom was unable to portrait this grieve-stricken young man with a mission! Maybe his acting skills just aren't good enough or maybe the movie just needed a real man! Gladiator had Russell Crowe and Kingdom of Heaven had Orlando Bloom. Kingdom of Heaven was bound to loose that contest! Bloom did not convince me at all. I was disappointed in how the movie used the historical facts. Anyone who has ever read about the crusades and the holy land in the time of crusades and holy war knows that the truth was horrifying and almost barbaric. Kingdom of heaven was history PG 8 and there should be a warning label on the back. Many have written that the movie was more than fair to the Muslims but in fact it was more than fair to both sides. In fact it was the Christian knights who slaughtered every man, woman and child when they conquered the city, they started the war between two huge religions.Liam Neeson had his part in it. A very small part, in fact he left the movie too soon. Say anything about him I cannot, he was not there long enough. It was great how they portraits the dark ages in Europe when Bloom leaves for Jerusalem. However it also destroyed it a bit, especially on his arrival to Jerusalem, there were too many technical errors. It was sometimes too obvious where they used computers to create the scenes.I am no Muslim but the little I know of the religion is enough to know that they made MANY mistakes when creating this movie. from the clothes they wore to how they prayed. And come on, why did Ridley have them call God ""God"" and not ""Allah"" which would have been more correct. One last thing I want to criticize in the movie is the music. The soundtrack if you will. The music is there to compliment the scenes, to melt together and strengthen the impressions they want you to have. Instead I found myself getting irritated! Several places the music did not fit in! Sometimes not at all.When all this is said I want to underline the fact that the story was good. But you judge for yourselves ... I have given it 4 out of 10 stars! Enjoy",Kingdom of Heaven
989,frandsen2,More Snoozaid than Cruzade,1,22 January 2006,"Wow! Can't believe that movie just robbed me of 2 hours of my life - I'll never get them back! In all fairness the movie has some great scenery although never anything to rival King Kong or LOTR. As for the fighting scenes...awful stuff, bad cutting, bad angles, and confusing camera maneuvering. The worst part of the movie is, however, the plot...or the absolute and total lack of such. There is no logic behind anything, the actors either overact or simply fall through like wannabees on amateur night down at the local pub. Take my advice and don't invest 2 hours of your life in this dreadful attempt to squeeze the last drops of fame out of Orlando Bloom's name and associtation with LOTR.",Kingdom of Heaven
990,liz-380,Director's Cut- the masterpiece it was intended to be,10,24 May 2006,"Thank you, Ridley Scott, for a timeless masterpiece. Simple, yet profound are the universal spiritual principles revealed in this film. The drama continues in today's world and still, the obvious truth remains veiled from the eyes of those who are too preoccupied to see.Kingdom of Heaven reveals something new with each viewing and the soulful performances and subtle strengths of its protagonists leave much for the viewer to ponder in moments of pause and reflection.Truth is truth, beyond the influence of popular (and often erroneous) interpretations... Kingdom begins to explore the concept that brotherhood can be found in those with whom we share the path of spiritual principles, regardless of labels or history.",Kingdom of Heaven
991,scott-manning379,An exciting and thrilling insight into a story within a story of religion,8,17 March 2006,"An exciting and thrilling insight into the deeper side of religion than I have ever seen within an action film. This film obviously has a huge and complex story to tell about religion. Without getting too much into the nitty gritty of whose religion is better, Ridley Scott has attacked a subject with this brilliantly directed epic. Orlando Bloom is amazing, a true British actor, stylish and with his heroic proportions from similar roles, he makes this film. Alexander Siddig (Deep Space Nine; Doctor) plays his opposite number in the film and brings a great balance to the story. I thought this was an excellent film, cinematography, music, casting and reference to fact as we know it was spot on. Liam Neeson, although not credited on the box, plays a vital role, bringing a real quality to the film. Another uncredited actor is Edward Norton, his role is monumental and inspiring for all Brits, (you'll just have to watch it to work out who he plays). Not many films can stand the test of time, lines, fight scenes and general scripting are what make a film and this one could go all the way. This one will never leave my collection.",Kingdom of Heaven
992,CuongPham5621,Kingdom of Heaven: A Kingdom of Blood and Faith,9,2 December 2018,"After being struck with the disaster of his wife and unborn child's death, Balian (Orlando Bloom) decided to leave his life as a blacksmith behind to join his long-lost father, Baron Godfrey, (Liam Neeson) on a journey to Jerusalem as a crusader. After a perilous journey, Balian arrived at the Holy City and got tangled up in an internal battle between the crusaders that wanted peace and the other that wanted war with the Muslims. The days of peace are numbered, however, as the leprous king Baldwin IV (Edward Norton) was getting nearer to death with every passing day. Unlike Baldwin, his heir, Guy de Lusignan, (Martin Csokas) wanted to wage war with the Muslims for his political and personal gains. Although the movie is criticized to be inaccurate in many parts, the scenes, as well as dialogues, successfully portrays crusaders in the 12th century and what, other than riches and glory, made them travel to a place so far from home.
With a simple search on the internet, one could easily find out that Balian d'Ibelin was a historical figure that existed and had little in common with the Balian represented in Kingdom of Heaven. The movie created an interesting and unique background for Balian but it did so at the cost of realism. How is one supposed to believe that a blacksmith during his short time in the Holy Land learned superb swordfighting skills, irrigation, siege defense and got into a love affair with princess Sibylla (Eva Green)? With all the things that he accomplished throughout the movie, Balian needed to have far greater knowledge that a blacksmith can have.
But although Balian's journey is not factual, the movie crafted characters that has unique and interesting personalities that viewers can't help but be intrigued by. From the mysterious yet clearly kind Leper King behind a silver mask to the beautiful and mesmerizing Princess Sybilla, we can't help but fall in love with them and sympathize with their tragic life stories. William Thomas from the review website Empire shared ""It's so gorgeous you'll forgive it a lot, but this is a frustratingly thin epic."" He also felt that the movie looks impressively real but it never feels like it due to reasons like Balian devised digging a well in a place that had been inhabited for more than two thousand years but it is still forgiveable like many other aspects of the movie.
Despite having an amazing cast with wonderful lines that bring the crusaders of the 12th century to life, director Ridley Scott failed to capture the intense battle scenes that viewers who watch historical movies would normally expect. Jeffrey M. Anderson from the review website Combustible Celluloid said ""Scott is currently one of the worst offenders in the school of shake-the-camera and cut-really-fast; it's a method of covering up action rather than highlighting it, and it usually means that there isn't much action to begin with."" For example, in the big battle sequence that shows Balian's few knights going up against a far larger Muslim cavalry force, all we could see were ""Dusty, helmeted figures grapple with each other in near-silhouette. He solves the problem by having Balian suddenly whip off his helmet so that we can see his face and flowing hair, even if he's now unprotected."" This comes back to the problem many critics believe to be fatal to the movie, historical accuracy. Back in medieval times, armor, although it did not provide absolute protection is still vital to a knight's survival in battle. It really breaks the enjoyment of the movie if the viewer realized Balian wanted to let his hair flow free instead of protecting his head from the thrust of a spear or the swing of a sword.
However, despite the obvious neglect of historical accuracy in action scenes, the movie focuses an extreme amount of dedication to the dialogues of its characters. A fair example of this is the scene where Baron Godfrey talks to Balian on his bed after being mortally wounded about Balian's future. Godfrey asked if Balian knew what lies in the Holy Land, it is a place at the end of the world where a man is not what he is born but what he has in himself to be. Balian made it clear all he wants is forgiveness for himself and not land riches nor glory. Godfrey told Balian no matter his positions he is of Godfrey's house and will serve the king of Jerusalem. To this Balian replied, ""What could a king asked of a man like me?"" ""A better world, a kingdom of conscience, a kingdom of heaven with peace between Christians and Muslims."" From this touching scene, we can see how Godfrey knows his time is almost over and seek to pass over his title and ideals to Balian, teaching him to follow the king and help him build a true kingdom of God on earth and not just another European-like kingdom.
Although Kingdom of Heaven failed to deliver to viewers a true experience of what it was like during the crusades. However, it gave the viewers a romanticized version of the time-period with king Baldwin IV and his followers desperately try to maintain peace on God's kingdom. The movie showed us that maybe there were people that came to the end of the earth for faith, not greed, maybe there were people that wanted to safeguard the helpless in a place devastated by war. It proved that Jerusalem is not just a kingdom of blood but also of faith and that good did exist.",Kingdom of Heaven
993,tkh53048,Orlando Bloom in the lead? What an error!,3,4 June 2006,"Little floaty things in the air. It seems that our Ridley loves little floaty things. He used them in Legend and he uses them at the beginning of this film. If nothing else Kingdom of Heaven confirms that when it comes to using little floaty things Ridley Scott has no peer. This is a film that seems to be not so much a film as the trailer for the eventual release of the three hour director's cut when we finally get the missing pieces of the plot and the film. At least I hope that there are missing pieces. I hope that in the near future we will be able to blame some studio executive for taking the film away from Ridley and doing awful things to it.With all the film's failings, and they are Legion, none is so great as casting Orlando Bloom in the lead. What a horrendous choice. Leo Gorcey would have been worse but it would have certainly heightened the comic element which really only existed when Saladin says the ""nothing/everything"" about Jersualem. The smile on Ghassan Massoud's face when he says it is priceless. Back to Bloom. Face Hollywood...the camera doesn't love him. He has no screen presence. The error could have solved by having Bloom play King Baldwin instead of Edward Norton.Another comment was made regarding Bloom's character apparently having turned into a sword prodigy in minutes. I suggest that just, perhaps, as a maker of swords he was always demonstrating them to prospective buyers.Oh....there are some very pretty moments and, if nothing else, the comments made about Jersualem resonate with the current state of the Mideast.",Kingdom of Heaven
994,orange_ryland,Another Ridley Scott epic time-piece that you'll absolutely love!,10,22 March 2006,"The Scott brothers are at it again! This ones easily goes down in the ranks next to Gladiator and Man on Fire. But it is most certainly an epic and you will need to be willing to go in for the long haul if your going to see it. This is an epic story of how one man who only ever wanted to be a blacksmith and ended up finding himself on the crusaders' road to Jerusalem. But, those who are supposed to be enemies end up earning a respectful friendship, and those who should be friends, lose all respect. I liked the movie because it allowed us to stretch our creative minds because the engineering and battle sequences, along with ingenuity in farming techniques, tantalized our imagination while staying inside the realm of realty. Additionally in this masterpiece, you will find the classic story of a forbidden love that sustains through the conflicts of the movie. Another aspect of this movie that sets it above the average level is the inspirational effect it has on you. After watching this movie, you want to go out and try to do something that you have always been to scared to do or have failed at before. Finally, this movie would be a great addition to your collection if you are a fan of art. The photography and cinematography of the movie keep you interested throughout the whole movie and the filming is its entirely own masterpiece. After having seen it, you won't be able to get it out of your head because of some of the controversial issues portrayed in the movie. And if it doesn't get you thinking about something, you won't be able to forget the movie by any stretch. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who considers themselves a movie expert or collector.",Kingdom of Heaven
