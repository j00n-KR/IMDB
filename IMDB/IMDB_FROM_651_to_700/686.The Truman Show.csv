0,MartinHafer,A good film for those who think they hate Jim Carey.,9,16 February 2014,"I have never liked Jim Carey's humor. I have found it to very broad and boorish. However, I was very happy that I saw ""The Truman Show"" and am surprised I did considering my feelings about his earlier 'comedies'. Thankfully, Carey showed he could act and NOT ham it up--a tribute to his native talents as well as the director and writer. With a weak director, Carey might have begun to seek laughs in 1001 crazy ways. Here, however, it's straight and quite endearing. I could talk about the plot, but there are already a bazillion reviews for this one. The bottom line is that don't assume because you don't like ""Dumb and Dumber"" or ""Ace Ventura"" you won't love this film. And, I really loved ""The Truman Show"" and think it's a lovely film with a lot of heart and an awful lot of imagination.By the way, I would say the same things about Will Farrell and Adam Sandler. Despite disliking some of there very broad films, there serious films (such as ""Reign Over Me"" or ""Stranger Than Fiction"") are exceptional. Additionally, I gotta admit that I did enjoy a few of their 'stupid' films such as ""Water Boy"" and ""Talladega Nights"". So don't assume that just because you may not like a few of their films means they all are not your cup of tea.",The Truman Show
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Peter Weir, Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, wow wasn't I in for a treat?",10,14 April 2010,"After being blown away by Fearless, I set out to see more of Peter Weir's work. Along the way I came across The Truman Show. After watching the film, I have nothing but praise for this film. The Truman Show is a truly dazzling and sophisticated satirical comedy drama on media omnipotence that benefits from fine direction and performances. Beautifully scripted by Andrew Niccol and flawlessly directed by Weir, the film is utterly captivating from the start right through to the truly poignant finale. Here Carrey plays Truman Burbank, the star of the world's most popular reality show. The catch is he doesn't know that. Truman believes he lives in Seahaven an island community that is somewhat idyllic, but in reality it is just a set housed in a studio with his friends and family as actors. This realisation and how it comes across is ambitious admittedly, then again I find Weir a fairly ambitious director, but it comes across as brilliant. Aside from the directing, concept and script, the acting really does soar here. Having loved his performances in Liar Liar and The Mask, I was looking forward to seeing Jim Carrey in a more dramatic role, and his restrained performance while funny in parts(in a subtle way in alternative to hysterical) is very sympathetic and moving. Ed Harris is great as Christoff and Laura Linney is outstanding as Meryl. Overall, brilliant film, it is funny but poignant too. 10/10 Bethany Cox",The Truman Show
2,Leofwine_draca,What can I say? A whimsical comic fantasy that I actually liked,7,23 November 2016,"An engaging, one of a kind fantasy yarn which propels you into a journey into an impossible world, and is one of those ""concept"" movies that stays in the mind (the only other comparable work I can think of at the moment would be GROUNDHOG DAY). In the light of reality shows like BIG BROTHER, THE TRUMAN SHOW is effective in its depiction of an entire world obsessed with one specific television program, which is in itself the ultimate ""reality"" show as it shows the 24-hour day, 7-day a week life of the one guy who's not acting in a sea of fake appearances and pretend people. Blessed with excellent music and a fine, distinctly un-Hollywood director in Peter Weir, this is a film in which the concept can't fail. The script is witty and highly amusing at times, especially when real-life invades the fantasy world and has to be desperately explained away by the producers.Jim Carrey - to be frank, an actor I can't stand - puts in a restrained and adequate performance as Truman, probably the most accessible role for his non-fans. Ed Harris steals his scenes as the frightening, bullish Christof, and the rest of the cast enjoy playing their over-the-top polite and friendly characters for all their worth. With a knowing wink at consumerism and without too much sentimentalising, this is perfect family fare and a must-see little film with a warm heart and the feel-good factor; in all probability it really did deserve the Oscar nominations it received.",The Truman Show
3,SnoopyStyle,"original, funny, touching, compelling",8,15 December 2014,"Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) lives an ordinary life as an insurance man in an idyllic seaside town Seahaven. He would love to go to Fiji but he is trap on the island by a fear stemming from a childhood trauma. It turns out his whole life is manufactured by TV artist Christof (Ed Harris). The Truman Show is the most popular TV-series in the world. His wife Meryl is played by actress Hannah Gill (Laura Linney). His best friend Marlon (Noah Emmerich) along with everybody in the town as well as the town itself is completely fake. Even his childhood trauma was manufactured. Questionable things keep happening. Sylvia (Natascha McElhone) who played his dreamgirl Lauren tries to help him escape.On one level, this is a profound drama about the TV world and modern life. On another level, this is a great character and Jim Carrey carries it off beautifully. It is both funny and thought-provoking. It's probably looked back on as a signpost for the 90s. This is a movie that is completely original and compelling.",The Truman Show
4,Hitchcoc,Black Comedy,7,18 May 1999,"""The Truman Show"" is about as depressing as anything I know.  It is about a society that is so jaded that the interactions in their lives are wholly inadequate--they prefer a fictionalized world to their own.  What is really sad is that this began in the fifties with ""Father Knows Best"" and ""Leave It to Beaver"" and exists now in the tiresome parade of sitcoms with their vacuous double entendres and empty lives marching across the screen. Whose wholesomeness, whose sexual manifestations are these?  With children gunning each other down in schools--desensitized to common respect (and I'm not just talking violence but respect for anything) to mindless, thoughtless pursuits of gratification.  We are the idiots watching ""The Truman Show.""  The greatest tragedy is that what might be looked at as outrageous is actually occurring every day--we just haven't put artificial walls around our little town.Jim Carrey is quite good--he can shine those pearly whites at the camera with the best.  But couldn't it have been anyone?  His efforts to free himself are not of significant because it can all be rewritten anyway.  His obstacles are not important because it isn't the actors who are staging this--it's on the other side of the cardboard.  For a movie which qualifies as modern fantasy, this is anything but.",The Truman Show
5,kosmasp,Reality TV,9,2 June 2021,"Rewatching this I can't help but wonder: What would today be possible? In creating a world and havng someone in that world being oblivious about being just a pawn ... being a ""prisoner"" ... I'm not sure I need the "", but you understand surely what I mean.I had watched this, but it was a long time ago, so it was interesting to rewatch this and understand how relevant this still is today. Or rather even more relevant than it was back then. The movie takes us into a town that is artificial ... to so many extras in a show ... I mean if you think about many things, there may be some issues (holes in the internal logic it has or hasn't, the father thing that seems to be a problem, just to almost be totally ignored towards the end, without any explanation - maybe deleted scenes?) .... but if you do not let those things muddle your impression/effect the movie has ... you will be more than entertained. It may even be able to make you question some of your own choices ... because after all, this is not just a stab at society in general, but also choices we make ... the limitations we set ourselves ... imprison us.A classic in so many ways - and showing that Jim Carey can do more than just being crazy ... he can actually act.",The Truman Show
6,classicsoncall,"""We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented"".",8,19 November 2011,"I recently read about a syndrome that involves people who come to believe that they are the star of their own reality TV show. They believe that they alone are the center of the universe and everyone and everything that comes in contact with them exist for their own personal benefit and enjoyment. This isn't exactly the idea behind ""The Truman Show"", but it was close, as Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) was born and raised as a corporate entity and marketed to the world as the central character of a thirty year old, twenty four hour a day living soap opera. I guess the picture did the best job it could of providing the viewer with the rationale needed to make this concept work, like throwing up roadblocks in Truman's youth to steer him to certain conclusions about life and it's limitations. On closer examination however, some of those foundations begin to crumble. One of the biggest plot holes for me involved Truman's marriage to Meryl (Laura Linney). Even though presented with a simulated wedding photo showing Meryl's fingers crossed, my thoughts proceeded to the honeymoon and the consummation of their marriage. How did Truman rationalize beyond that point to where the story picks up for us? Still, in an age of realty TV and celebrity 'This and That With the Stars', it was probably only a matter of time before a subject like this was tackled for a provocative film treatment. I wouldn't put it past any large corporation on the scale, say of Exxon Mobil or General Electric, to jump the shark and participate in something as totally over the top as The Truman Show. And sadly, I see no small amount of willing participants eager to sell their souls for a brief moment of fame, glory and wealth. Why I'll bet there's someone out there who would be willing to stage an elaborate high profile courtship, plan a big expensive wedding, and then get divorced after only seventy two days. I'm just saying.",The Truman Show
7,gavin6942,Very Philosophic,7,18 December 2014,"An insurance salesman/adjuster (Jim Carrey) discovers his entire life is actually a T.V. show.This movie has been brought to ethics and philosophy classes and used as a tool for discussion. Unfortunately it was never used in any class I took (despite being a philosophy major), but I guess we cannot all get that experience.So much to ponder: was it right to treat Truman this way? Was the television executive playing God? If the wife (Laura Linney) was only in it as part of a contract and not because she genuinely cared for Truman, what does that make her? And what if this really happened? Would people watch it or rebel?",The Truman Show
8,lee_eisenberg,it would be just like a corporation to do this to someone,10,1 August 2005,"Truman Burbank's (Jim Carrey) life is a TV show. Nothing about his idyllic small town is real, but rather created for him to live in. And he doesn't know about any of it, because a cabal of slimy people have successfully kept him there his whole life. Until one day when he starts to get suspicious that there's something going on.The movie not only shows the corporation completely manipulating someone's life, but might also be interpreted as a metaphor for being a prisoner of TV. I've never seen a Peter Weir movie that I didn't like, and ""The Truman Show"" further backs that up. This movie really deserved an Oscar.",The Truman Show
9,jboothmillard,The Truman Show,10,16 September 2005,"From BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated directed Peter Weir (Witness, Dead Poets Society) this is a fantastic satirical drama comedy film, with a great comedy star taking on a more dramatic turn. The film begins with an interview with Christof (Golden Globe and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Ed Harris) winning, creator of the highly popular reality show called The Truman Show, along with cast members Hannah Gill playing Truman's ""wife"" Meryl (Laura Linney) and his best friend Noah (Noah Emmerich). Then we get to the main story, where since birth, Truman Burbank (Golden Globe winning Jim Carrey) has been the star of the show, only he doesn't know it, and he has lived in his fictional town filled with an all actors cast. On Day 10,909, a TV camera suddenly falls from the sky, and later on character Lauren, played by Sylvia (Natascha McElhone) tries to tell him that everything is fake and everyone is pretending. Very slowly more peculiar things happen to make him believe he is ""part of something"" (e.g. his wife promoting products, he sees his Dad who he saw die, the radio broadcasts his movement, he sees a film crew where the elevator is meant to be, characters circling the block, and when he tries to get away everything the makers can think of are stopping him). The network is the first to legally adopt a child, they have 5000 cameras watching Truman's every moment from the mundane to the monumental, they gave Truman a fear of water when his Dad ""drowned"", and they have no intention on ending. But when they think they have sorted everything bringing back Truman's ""father"" (Brian Delate), Truman tricks the camera and escapes, but not before they find him sailing away from the town. They attempt to scare and stop him with a storm, but he continues till eventually he reaches the studio edge (i.e. the sky). Christof talks to him for the first time when he sees the staircase and exit, and has a little heart to heart to try and make him stay, and when he asks him to say something because he's live to the whole world, Truman says his catchphrase ""In case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!"" and finally leaves. Also starring Holland Taylor as Truman's mother, Paul Giamatti as Control room director, Spinal Tap's Harry Shearer as Mike Michaelson and Bruce Almighty's Philip Baker Hall as Network executive. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it won the BAFTAs for Best Production Design, Best Original Screenplay and the David Lean Award for Direction, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Cinematography and Best Special Effects, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Burkhard Von Dallwitz and Philip Glass, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay - Motion Picture. Jim Carrey was number 47 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Outstanding!",The Truman Show
10,rmax304823,All About the Man in the Moon.,7,5 January 2008,"Kind of a complicated business, this film. Most of Peter Weir's movies are, but at least he lays open here the source of our discomfort. It's a palimpsest of basically three layers. (1) The visual story we see unfolding on the screen, the one that Peter Weir shows us. (2) The story as constructed by the world's greatest producer, The Man in the Moon named Cristof (Ed Harris), who manages the television show of which the thirtyish real-estate salesman, Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey), is the unknowing star. And (3) the presumed allegory that deals with such Big Issues as conformity, happiness, God, free will, artifice, and television.Carrey lives on glossy, carefully enameled Sea Haven Island, a paradisaical place of warm sunshine, neat middle-class housing, clipped and barbered lawns, cheery neighbors and co-workers, a beautiful and accommodating wife (Laura Linney), and a lifelong friend who bring him the occasional six pack of brewskies. Everything is peace and prosperity. Then things begin to seem a little odd to Carrey. When he breaks his routine, he stumbles into unsettling scenes. What should be the interior of an elevator turns out to be a craft service table with glazed donuts and a few strangers who gawk at him before running off.There isn't space to go on with this in any detail, but finally Carrey realizes that he can trust no one on the island and is literally a prisoner there. Every escape attempt is blocked by some incident -- traffic, an accident at a nuclear power plant -- something. He manages to sail away across the small sea and, pow, the bowsprit of his little boat punctures the wall of the largest television studio in the world. His life is a world-wide hit on TV, filmed on 5,000 hidden cameras. Given a choice between the scripted, almost perfect life he's been leading, and a new life full of challenges and entropy, he plumps for -- well, guess which one.As for level number two, the TV program built around the life of one Truman Burbank, who has been on the world's screens from the instant of birth until his final choice, Ed Harris is the man responsible and he and his crew live in the fake moon that hovers so picturesquely in Sea Haven's night time sky. Harris gives the best performance. His character brims with intricacies. His first thoughts are of the show, of the business part of it. It's sustained by product placement. Every artifact that Carrey touches or talks about brings in revenue. But Harris isn't at all a caricature. Of course he wants Carrey to stay put and the show to continue, but he's sentimental too. When he tells Carrey at the end, ""I was there when you took your first baby steps,"" he's soft and convincing. But as the director of the world's greatest show, Harris is pretty clumsy and it's a wonder that it took the hero some thirty years to tumble. Carrey tries to leave the island on a bus but the bus won't start. The driver, an actor, calls, ""Everybody off,"" and the other passengers who have been sitting like dummies all stand up at once and file out in order. That's not how it's done, not if it's to look like anything but acting. An experienced director would ask who was born in the first half of the year. They should stand up at random, some slow and others not, and crowd up at the door, followed by those who were born in the second half of the year. In fact, Harris is an extraordinarily inept director.That leads us to level three -- what's it all about? I'd be the first to admit I don't know. Peter Weir might even be the second. I doubt, though, that it's any accident that Ed Harris's director who lives in the fake sky goes by the name of Cristof. His mixed attitude towards Carrey is probably not accidental either. Harris has fits of pique when Carrey doesn't do as he's expected. (Cf., the Garden of Eden business in Genesis.) But he's merciful and spares the miscreant's life, edging into New Testament territory. If he's sometimes careless, maybe that's why we humans have this tendency to mutilate one another. Imagine a director who can stage an impromptu power plant accident off-island to stop Carrey but has extras check their watches before crossing the street. ""What, then, did the hand of the potter shake?"" The world applauds when Carrey achieves free will, although nobody is sure that's such a hot idea. Look what happened to Alex in ""A Clockwork Orange."" No more space, I'm afraid. Good luck with the movie. It gets a lot of points for tripping up an audience expecting a dumb comedy or a dumb action movie. It's anything but that. Weir seems almost as ambitious as Cristof.One final question. Why in hell would an entire outside world be enthralled by a TV program about the life of a dull man? But maybe it's not worth asking in light of the popularity of reality TV shows like ""American Idol"" and ""Survivor.""",The Truman Show
11,Tweekums,Jim Carrey is on top form in this satire on reality television,8,17 September 2016,"Truman Burbank thinks he is an ordinary person doing an ordinary job in a fairly ordinary town... he does not realise that he is the star of a reality show. He has lived in the town of Seahaven all of his life; never suspecting that cameras are watching his every move and that everybody else, including his wife, mother and his friends are merely cast members and that the town itself is under a giant dome. Strange things occasionally happen but excuses are quickly made; for example a falling spotlight is explained away as something that fell from a plane. From an early age Truman has been conditioned so that he won't try to leave the town; the drowning of his father gave him a terror of the sea and any time he thinks about leaving an obstacle appears. Eventually he starts to realise that something is wrong and decides that he must leave to prove that he isn't paranoid.'The Truman Show' is a fine satire of reality television made when the genre was just starting. The idea that Truman might live for thirty years before he realises something isn't right with his world might seem unlikely at first but one has to remember that this reality is all that he has ever known. Jim Carrey can be a bit annoying at times but here he is on top form and gives one of his best performances as the eponymous Truman; he manages to be funny without being silly and makes the viewer sympathise with Truman. Ed Harris is also impressive as Christof, the creator of the show who has directed Truman's entire life and is determined that the show must go on. The reality of Truman's world is fun with lots of digs at modern media; characters talk as though they are in commercial which of course they are and a travel agent's shop is decorated with posters guaranteed to put you off flying! There are also touching moments such as Truman falling for an extra who is quickly taken 'off to Fiji' by her 'father'. Not only do we see what is happening to Truman; we are shown the fans of the show who are obsessed with his life which emphasises just how public Truman's life is. Overall I strongly recommend this; the concepts may be quite dark but it is presented in such a way that it can be enjoyed by people of all ages.",The Truman Show
12,moonspinner55,"An unattractive idea, given an unfocused treatment",2,29 June 2001,"Rarely have I seen a major motion picture that looked as awful as this one does. We get the fact that modern suburbia is supposed to look like a plastic paradise out of a TV commercial, but the colors here are tepid, the camera set-ups dull and unimaginative, and the direction mechanical and without a hint of inspiration. Jim Carrey, playing Truman (whose life is a TV show though he doesn't know it), shows off his dreaded ""range"" as a performer; he's always on-camera a second too soon and stays there seconds too long. This is also the fault of the director (Peter Weir?!) and the editor, who hope we in the audience don't miss any of their tricks.

14,blanche-2,Deceptive,8,13 July 2008,"Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is the star of ""The Truman Show"" in this 1998 film directed by Peter Weir. Truman's life is a fake reality show, watched by millions of viewers, though he doesn't know that. He lives in the small seaside town of Seahaven, a peaceful place. Truman is married, has a best friend and works as an insurance agent. He has an unnatural fear of water after being in a boating accident in which his father died.One day he boards an elevator and it isn't an elevator; he sees his dead father in town; and a woman has a strange message for him that he doesn't understand. He tries to leave town with his wife, and it simply doesn't happen. The ""reality,"" if there is one, is that Truman doesn't really exist; the town is fake, filled with actors (one of whom, the man who played his father, comes back to make trouble). That person on the bicycle, the passing car, etc., that's on a repeating loop. He has a public he has never met who follow each phase of life with interest. His producer, the man who created Truman, is a man named Christof, who took an illegitimate child and turned him into a media star. When Truman tries to get out, he realizes just how trapped he is.With today's reality shows abounding, ""The Truman Show"" today is even more fascinating than it was in 1998. Here's a reality show that's not a reality - and it makes you wonder about what we're watching on reality shows today. It brings up all the metaphysical questions of who am I and who made me. The film also asks us to take a look at our attraction to the lives of celebrities, where people are merely an image, and where we separate the events of their lives from the actual human being for some good gossip; after all, we only know the persona, not the real person, and we only know what the media reports, not the whole story. In the end we have no idea of what Britney Spears or Madonna or Brangelina are like as people, what they think, what their day to day life is like. In the movie, we know Truman's - and his whole story is false.It's said that a great comedian can do drama, and Jim Carrey is proof of this, giving a brilliant, heartfelt performance as Truman. Ed Harris is fabulous as Christoff, the puppeteer who created Truman and needs him. Such a wonderful film, it demands a second viewing.",The Truman Show

I truly believe Carrey should have gooten the Oscar.  His performance as Truman Burbank, the simple yet always wathced (for many years) on television by millions of viewers, person should have got him the Oscar for best actor. He doesn't portray the usual goofy comic guy, but this time a simple man who is in the media crossfire, and he doesn't even know it.

The film chronicles the life of a man who is initially unaware that he is living in a constructed reality television show, broadcast around the clock to billions of people across the globe. Truman becomes suspicious of his perceived reality and embarks on a quest to discover the truth about his life.It was written by Andrew Niccol and directed by Peter Weir.Truman Burbank is unaware that his entire life is a hugely popular 24- hour-a-day TV series. Every moment of his existence is captured by concealed cameras and telecast to a giant global audience. His friends and family are actors who smile pleasantly at Truman's familiar catchphrase greeting, ""In case I don't see you later, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!"" Employed at an insurance company, he is married to merry Meryl, and they live in the cheerful community of Seahaven, an island where the weather is always mild and no unpleasantness intrudes. This is the basic situation of the series, which has grown over the years into a billion-dollar franchise for the TV network. As an unwanted pregnancy, Truman was adopted by the network and raised in the zoolike environment of a TV soundstage. Thus, the TV audience became hooked when Truman was very young. Now, at age 30, he still doesn't know he's a prisoner on an immense domed city-size soundstage, simulating Seahaven. Both the illusion and the ratings will collapse if Truman ever leaves Seahaven. In addition to elaborate events staged to make sure he stays put, Truman is given constant reminders of how wonderful Seahaven is compared to dangers in other parts of the world. However, his growing suspicions make him curious enough to try to leave, and the show's director and master manipulator Christof (Ed Harris) must constantly devise ways to thwart Truman's escape attempts. To enter the harbor, Truman must overcome his fear of water.This is a funny, tender, and thought-provoking film.It is noteworthy for its remarkably prescient vision of runaway celebrity culture and a nation with an insatiable thirst for the private details of ordinary lives.The issues it tackles are just as relevant now than they were when the film was first released theatrically.Also,it has great performances from the cast especially from Jim Carrey in what may be the performance of his career.",The Truman Show

There are questions you have while watching this film that you think ""oh, they'll answer that in a minute"", but they don't, preferring instead to cover the same old ground.I was surprised to see that Peter Weir (Dead Poet's Society') directed this because although that film was longer, it had more fresh ideas than this film manages in less time.People rave about this film.

19,Theo Robertson,Not That Original Or Groundbreaking,6,28 August 2005,"Let's not delude ourselves that THE TRUMAN SHOW is all that iconoclastic , prophetic or mind blowing original . In the late 1960s Nigel Kneale wrote a BBC teleplay called THE YEAR OF THE SEX OLYMPICS where very similar ideas are explored so the central plot of a man having his whole life manipulated and broadcast to billions of watching people isn't all that clever if you're familiar with the works of Nigel Kneale I have to confess that while this movie was released in 1998 a couple of years before reality TV saturated the airwaves of western television i had never seen it until a couple of days ago which means my view of this movie especially its plot is prejudiced by a force fed television diet of ordinary people going about their lives so the idea that billions of people watching a man selling insurance comes across as totally ridiculous to me . We've seen BIG BROTHER become a parody of itself ( And has been parodied in the recent series of DOCTOR WHO ) while other similar shows have suffered from slipping ratings and critical backlash . So it seems ridiculous that billions of people across the globe are compelled to watch a mundane real life show for thirty years Not to be totally negative what the producers have done with THE TRUMAN SHOW is structure it correctly where it's revealed from the outset that Truman Burbank is unwittingly living inside a massive TV studio . If the story had been constructed as a M Night Shymalan type mystery where it's revealed to the audience at the end that it's all a television show this would have been a disaster , can you imagine the word of mouth giving away the ending ? Without hammering it home there is a logic to the motives of producing a show like this - Product placement , and Jim Carrey gives a restrained performance and makes Truman a sympathetic character . But if it's mind blowing prophesy and social commentary you desire then I'm afraid THE TRUMAN SHOW is inferior to THE YEAR OF THE SEX OPLYMPICS",The Truman Show

21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Meaningful,8,29 January 2008,"It's been about a decade since this film came out, and the sad truth is, the majority of people haven't learned. Reality TV is not dead, but has rather flourished, and is gradually becoming more and more perverse(indeed making the idea presented here seem almost tame by comparison, which is a very unpleasant notion to consider), digging deeper into the lowest common denominator to grab attention(worse still, it's working), and they are at least as shallow as they've always been, quite possibly worse(I won't claim that I watch them), and costing depth in real people, by abandoning it in favor of more ratings-grabbing ""entertainment"". Niccol is not a man who favors superficiality, or that which seems, at first glance, to be perfect, beautiful, or even right... nor is he one who keeps quiet about his view on said subject. One needs to look no further than two other movies he wrote, Gattaca and S1m0ne, both of which he also directed(he is perhaps less shrill in his protesting in the former and this, compared to S1m0ne). I've not watched much of Weir's work... to this day, only this and Dead Poets Society, which my review will immediately reveal, I did not find to be anything special. Therefore, I don't know whose idea it actually was to let the imaginary hidden cameras be our eye into the world of Truman... whether Niccol had it in the script, or Weir thought it fitting... but I commend and respect whomever thought of it. The score and music are fitting. The acting is good, all-round... Carrey surprises. Harris is marvelous. Carrey may have some sillier moments in this, but it is a film separate from his comedy work. Those seeking his typical brand of humor(which it should be noted, I am somewhat fond of) won't find that satisfied herein. Exposition is delivered with fairly good subtlety. The writing in general is excellent... Niccol hits the mark entirely, and maintains a realistic tone, steering carefully clear of the pitfall of mockery to the point of the ludicrous, which he would later fall into with S1m0ne, and his continued exploration of reality is interesting. I personally make it a point to keep up with what the man is working on. The satire and cleverness found in his work deserves recognition. This, as The Cable Guy, has some social commentary on the viewers, but on the whole, this is by far the superior film(sorry, Ben). It is but saddening that it would seem that the film caused exactly what it may have been trying to prevent. I recommend this to fans of science fiction, Andrew Niccol and Jim Carrey as a dramatic actor. 8/10",The Truman Show
22,view_and_review,Truman the Show and Truman the Movie Worked,8,6 February 2016,"""Truman"" was the first serious movie I'd ever seen from Jim Carrey--heck it may have been his first non-comedy period. This movie was stunning. What was so amazing was the fact that they let you in on the secret pretty early instead of leaving it as a twist. So instead of finding out at the end of the movie that it was all staged we find out relatively early which leaves us something else to look forward to: will he ever find out? And if he does, what will he do? Carrey was great as the simple small town happy character. He brought the character to life which made it all work. Truman couldn't be a skeptic, he couldn't be a big dreamer, he couldn't even be a roamer; he had to be the exact type of character he was for it all to work. Truman, the fictitious show worked and ""Truman"" the movie worked.",The Truman Show
23,evanston_dad,A Presage of Reality T.V.,8,21 June 2010,"""The Truman Show"" has only become more relevant since the time of its release due to the reality T.V. boom that has confirmed television's capacity for evil.Jim Carrey plays a man who's the star (unbeknownst to himself) of a reality show about his life that is watched by the world. Director Peter Weir finds a way to use Carrey's exaggerated comedic mannerisms in context of a real character rather than a caricature, and Carrey does well with the material. It's not hard to read ""The Truman Show"" as an allegory for the fate that befalls famous people when their private lives become public domain.The film also stars Ed Harris as a god figure (in other words, a director) and Laura Linney in one of the first roles that began to establish her as a recognizable face.Grade: A-",The Truman Show

It stars Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank whose life is an open book for anyone who wishes to watch. He is unaware of the hidden cameras that observe his every move since birth. Anyone who attempts to warn him of his peep hole existence thus sabotaging the show, are removed. Through space satellite program director Ed Harris has achieved the first fully televised human life. Everybody is an actor and Truman is gradually suspecting that something just isn't right. Triumphant masterpiece by director Peter Weir whose credits include Dead Poet's Society. Could Weir have predicted the influence his film would hail onto reality television? Filled with creative camera angles and art direction. Carrey delivers a sympathetic performance combined with comic wonder and bewilderment. He is the ultimate modern hero and champion. Harris is fantastic as creator Crissoff whose genius knows no limits until his creation challenges him. Laura Linney is bizarre as Truman's wife who speaks as if in commercials. Noah Emmerich plays his best friend who stocks bending machines. Natascha Mcelhone plays Sylvia who attempted to warn Truman of the reality of his lifestyle.

Carrey almost in a role as if it were created for him.The viewer and the show audience all root for Truman's triumph, as his aspirations are thwarted time and again. The premise brilliantly creative, though criminal. Likely spawning a lot of the reality tv to follow, which doesn't work as knowing makes it entirely unreal. Quality musical cues and Harris and others good as well.

26,AaronCapenBanner,All Of Life A TV Show?,7,5 December 2013,"Peter Weir directed this comedy-drama that stars Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, a seemingly ordinary and happily married man who lives in a nice town, with a nice job and friends, but grows increasingly suspicious that something is off, and it turns out he's right, as Truman is unknowingly the star of the world's biggest reality TV show, where everything has been scripted since he was a baby, even his family. Once aware of this, Truman tries to find a way out, while the show's creator and director Christof(played by Ed Harris) tries to keep a lid on the situation... Existentialist film works reasonably well, though this idea had been explored before on ""The Twilight Zone"". Still, this is an interesting and thought-provoking film regardless.",The Truman Show
27,Aaron1375,"Alright, but just to hard to believe.",7,8 March 2003,"This movie is kind of a take on reality TV. The show focuses on Jim Carrey's character Truman. The cameras follow him everywhere as he is actually living in this big TV studio. Everyone he thinks he knows are actors including his wife. Interesting enough, but I just have a hard time believing this show would have stayed on the air from this guy's birth to the point of being a grown man with a wife. No show lasts that long and this show would be rather dull one to watch. This one is at its best when it is more comedy oriented. Unfortunately, it is more of a drama and takes itself to seriously when it should be more fun to watch. Carrey does do a good job in the main role, but Ed Harris is just too bland for me. I can't believe he was nominated for an Oscar for this role...he just was not very good to me. I also don't think this TV show is realistic in that I would think it would be illegal to keep someone basically as a prisoner without their permission.All the faults aside though it is a rather good movie to watch, I just wish it were a bit funnier.",The Truman Show
28,The_Void,"Entertaining, funny, thought-provoking....a masterpiece.",9,28 August 2005,"The Truman Show has received quite a lot of praise since it's release in 1998, but it's never really managed to achieve the status that it rightly deserves. What we have here is a film that more than delivers on the entertainment front, while still finding time for a backbone of thought-provoking substance. More often than not with movies that work from a premise, rather than an actual plot, they miss the mark because of a lack of ideas to populate the premise with; but that certainly isn't the case here! The film follows the story of Truman Burbank. Truman is an insurance salesman, but unlike most insurance salesmen; he has his own show. And unlike most people with their own show...he doesn't know about it. Truman Burbank is the unwitting star of the massively successful TV show; The Truman Show. His whole life has been the subject of this show and everything that he believes to be real is actually the brainchild of the show's creator, the flamboyant Christof. We then follow Truman as he goes about finding out that the real world, and his world, are different places entirely.As you might expect, this plot gives the film great basis for thought-provoking ideas. The idea itself of having a TV show filmed around your life is intriguing to say the least, and is more than enough to inspire paranoia from more than a few audience members. The idea is fused with the drama surrounding Truman's life, and the two blend brilliantly. Adding to this is the way that the film gives a commentary on the waive of reality TV shows. The substance is more than evident, as we are shown that Truman is a prisoner within his own life and the TV crew are, in effect, 'God'. The Truman Show features what is probably Jim Carey's best performance. The way that he amiably portrays the character makes the film a delight to watch. Carey was, of course, more known for his over the top (and very good) comedy roles before this film, but here he really shows his worth as an actor. The rest of the cast is mainly made up of lesser-known stars, with Ed Harris standing out and the rest helping to build the film into a great ensemble drama. Before this film, Peter Weir was known for making OK-good films such as Dead Poet's Society and Witness; but this film is his masterpiece.",The Truman Show
29,Mr-Fusion,Brilliant,9,23 February 2016,"""The Truman Show"" is a marvel of engineering. Great cast, high concept, but it's the overall illusion that's really impressive; that it somehow all works. If you really wanted to poke holes in this movie, you could (the enormous resources required to maintain that dome, the ungodly costs, and that doesn't even touch the subject of prostituting Meryl). But the script is adept at addressing such concerns, or at least sweeping them under the rug. You find yourself absorbed in Truman's inner struggle, and his blossoming sense of adventure. This is probably my favorite Jim Carrey performance; he's ideal. Ed Harris, too (geez, what can't that guy do?). The movie's premise of reality TV isn't new (and I'm not sure it was even back in '98), but it's honestly an imaginative take on the whole concept and maintains a surprising level of depth.The truth is, there aren't all that many '90s movies that hold up on rewatch, but this one absolutely does.9/10",The Truman Show

It's a trend-setter.... in terms of presentation and execution.The film chronicles the life of a man who discovers he is living in a constructed reality soap opera, televised 24/7 to billions across the globe, known as 'The Truman Show'. Weir knew what he wanted to say through this film, his message comes across as a LOL first, but when you understand the film and it's meaning, you're left awe-struck. The film begins awkward, but sucks you into the plastic world 20-minutes into the film. The climax, is the high-point of the film, it's sad, and at the same time a Revelation. It's simply Magic! Weir's direction is EPIC! Andrew Niccol's screenplay is beautiful. In the acting department, the film belongs to Ed Harris. The Veteran Actor is simply fantastic in a supporting role. Jim Carrey brings Truman alive. The actor, as always, is flawless. Laura Linney is superb in a extended appearance. Noah Emmerich is excellent. Natascha McElhone is effective. Paul Giamatti does a fine job.'The Truman Show' is a must watch. His life is off-air now, re-visit the popular reality show once again, and know his legend.

32,JamesHitchcock,Life is Starting to Imitate Satire,10,31 August 2005,"Life is starting to imitate satire. ""The Truman Show"" was only made seven years ago, but it predates the current mania for so-called ""reality"" television shows such as ""Big Brother"". The idea behind such shows is that they present the viewer with a slice of actual reality- real people in real situations with real emotions- rather than the simulated reality of drama or the edited reality of documentaries. The flaw in this idea is that nothing is more unreal than a reality show. The presence of the cameras has a distorting effect, inducing artificial behaviour patterns in those who appear in front of it, and the sort of people who star in such programmes are almost invariably eccentric exhibitionists. ""The Truman Show"" takes the central concept of reality TV shows one stage further in order to overcome this flaw: what would happen if we made a reality programme about a person who has absolutely no idea that he is appearing on television? Truman Burbank is an insurance executive, living in a small American seaside town called Seahaven, and happily married to a nurse named Meryl. Or at least he thinks he is. What Truman doesn't know is that he is the central character in a soap opera and that his whole life is a fiction. The company he works for does not exist. Seahaven, the island it stands on and the surrounding ocean are all part of a gigantic set, specially created for the programme and sealed off from the outside world in a gigantic geodesic dome. Everyone in Truman's life- Meryl, his mother, his colleagues at work, his best friend Marlon- are actors playing out their roles in his drama.For thirty years Truman has accepted his world unquestioningly, but at the beginning of the film a series of incidents- a light falling from the sky, the reappearance of his father, who was supposed to have drowned in a boating accident when Truman was a boy, strange messages picked up on his car radio- awaken his doubts. Although members of the cast make strenuous attempts to dissuade him, he decides to try and explore the world outside Seahaven; in particular he wants to travel to Fiji where he has been told that his former girlfriend Sylvia now lives. (Sylvia was written out of the show when the scriptwriters decided that he should marry Meryl instead).The film has certain similarities with another film from the late nineties, ""Pleasantville"", which dealt with an inverted version of the same idea; two teenagers from the real world are magically transported into the world of a fifties television show. In my view, however, ""The Truman Show"" is the better of the two. ""Pleasantville"" deals with its political themes in a heavy-handed way with some very obvious symbolism. ""The Truman Show"", although it deals with some weighty issues, is never ponderous or excessively serious; indeed, it is often very humorous. The main source of humour is the contrast between the naïve, trusting Truman and the behaviour of those around him, all living a lie and desperately trying to prevent Truman from finding out that it is a lie. I had previously thought of Jim Carrey as a rather annoying actor whose appeal was based upon the idea that manic overacting is in itself funny, but here as Truman he is very good indeed, both amusing and touching. I was also impressed by Ed Harris as Christof, the show's enigmatic producer.Another factor in the success of the film is its visual look. Seahaven (like the town in ""Pleasantville"") appears as an eerily perfect, not-quite-real version of the typical American small town, but was actually filmed in a real place, the purpose-built village of Seaside, Florida. There are similarities with the cult British sixties television series ""The Prisoner"", which was also filmed in an eerily perfect seaside village, Portmeirion in North Wales.The film is obviously a satire on the intrusiveness and obsession with celebrity of the modern media; added relevance was given by the fact that it came out shortly after the death of Princess Diana. There is, however, more to it than that. Much has been made of the film as religious allegory; it has been pointed out that Christof whose name is clearly, and quite deliberately, similar to ""Christ"", is a God-figure, whereas Truman (the ""True Man"") is a symbolic Everyman. It has even been claimed that the film is an anti-religious allegory, with Truman's final escape from Seahaven symbolic of man's need to break away from outdated religious dogmas. This is not an interpretation with which I would agree- if one is trying to put across a ""God is dead"" message, it seems odd to provide a God-figure who is very much real, not mythical or illusory. The imagery of the final scenes  the calm after the storm, the ascent up a flight of stairs into the sky and clouds- also struck me as religious rather than secular. Moreover, the film seems too complex to be reduced to any single allegorical meaning, although it certainly deals with the relationship between man and God. It also touches on man's need to explore- both to explore new places and also to explore new ideas and to break away from established ways of life and ways of thought- and on the nature of reality. Truman's world may seem unreal to us, but as Christof says, ""we accept the reality we are presented with"".This is a brilliant, multi-layered film, part comedy, part satire, part philosophical speculation, and in my view one of the two best movies of the late nineties. (The other was ""American Beauty""). I felt it should have taken the ""Best Picture"" Oscar for 1999- ""Shakespeare in Love"" is a good film, but ""The Truman Show"" is a great one. It confirms my view that Peter Weir is one of the best directors currently working. 10//10",The Truman Show
33,Smells_Like_Cheese,A very unique and interesting story that has proved that Jim Carrey can act in a drama,8,12 March 2007,"I had heard a little bit of The Truman Show, I was watching a program where they were discussing Jim Carrey's career and they mentioned how The Truman Show was like his first major drama and how well he had performed in it. I never realized that this film was so well liked, especially when I went onto IMDb and people seemed to love this film very much. So of course I rented it at Hollywood Video and watched it last night and I have to say that I have pretty much the same opinion as most of the users, it's a great film that had a great dramatic story with a little dark comedy.Truman Burbank seems to have the most perfect life, he has a beautiful wife, a close nit community, a desk job, and a loving mother. But is it a little too perfect? Especially since everyone always seems to know his name? He meets a girl, Lauren, and they hit it off, but she tells him that she cannot speak to him or ""they'll"" take her away from him, she tells him that his life is a TV show and that his whole life has been a set up. He slowly discovers what his life has been and how it's either too perfect or the dramatics come at the perfect time. But is the world ready to let go of The Truman Show? The Truman Show is a well acted film with an incredible story that I'm more than certain any one could enjoy, it was very charming and had the perfect elements to the plot. Jim Carrey did a terrific job and this movie proved how great he could be in a drama instead of all comedy. Laura Linney was just perfect, I loved her constant details of everything she bought and how she presented it like a commercial.

Watching it again now as an adult made me really appreciate films like this. The concept and idea of this film makes it really captivating. It's interesting how this film and ""Pleasantville"" came out at the same time. While ""Pleasantville"" is about going into the fairy-tale land and making a difference, this one is about a man trying to leave the fairy-tale land. It isn't as magical as it was when I saw it as an adult but I now appreciate it more for what it is after having some life experiences of my own. It's about not conforming to the same routine, about taking risks, to sometimes be able to leave the comfort zone in order travel abroad and have experiences that are beyond where you are at. How some people can try to restrain you from exploring and and take away chances you dreamed of and how it's your choice when it comes to what you really want to do with your life. Despite the really far-fetched and a ridiculous concept this film has, it accomplished what it tried to do. Jim Carrey was at his peak when it came to stardom and was the topnotch actor at the time. And he was the perfect choice for this role at the time as well. Overall this the style of films I miss now a days, I highly recommend this one.8.1/10",The Truman Show
36,OllieSuave-007,Interesting TV show in a movie.,7,6 March 2015,"The Truman Show is a TV show in a movie, starring Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank who lives in a utopia-type town, where he is unaware that his life is a T.V. show and those around him are ""actors"" within the show.This movie starts off very slow and does not gain any traction until almost toward the middle of the middle, where Truman begins to realize that there is something wrong with the life he is living in. That is where things gain steam and become more exciting as the film progresses.Jim Carrey's acting was pretty good, as is Natascha McElhone, the actress who plays Carrey's love interest. Much of the other cast members acted too carefree and theatrical, which rendered them somewhat annoying. It was also distressing to see all of the characters in on this conspiracy of exploiting Truman's life in worldwide broad-casted T.V. show, making you root for Truman to outsmart the conspirators and escape the ""fake"" life they have envisioned for him.This movie sends a message that life is not simple and there is no such thing as a perfect world. Despite all the problems and turmoil in the world, there is nothing greater than your own freedom to live your life and make your own choices.Again, the movie takes quite a long while to gain any momentum, and Burkhard von Dallwitz's music score for the film seemed very out of place for the story.

This film was packed full of opportunities to explore the human and emotional issues behind these questions in a powerful and thought-provoking way, but aside from a couple of scenes, failed to do so.Jim Carrey stars as Truman Burbank, whose entire life (since before he was born) has been the subject of a television show. His world (unknown to him) is a huge studio, replete with oceans, artificial weather, etc. Everyone with whom he interacts is an actor hired to play a part. Carrey shows the ability to transcend the usual comedic roles he plays and displays dramatic talent, but either he or the writers (producers, etc.) seem to feel the need to keep falling back on his comedic talent (facial expressions, etc.) rather than allowing the drama of his journey of self-discovery to build. A glimpse of what might have been possible with this movie occurred in the scene where one almost thought he was about to kill the actress playing his wife as he crumbles psychologically with what he recognizes to be the inconsistencies of his life, but there are too few of these powerful moments.This was a good movie, but could have been so much better.",The Truman Show
38,ElMaruecan82,"""It's Live! It's Live!""...",10,28 May 2011,"With ""The Truman Show"", released in 1998, Peter Weir delivers a brilliant satire about the excesses of reality shows, with a prophetic relevance disguised under a misleading comedic mask. This underrated gem of the 90's, tells the original, to say the least, story of Truman Burbank, played by Jim Carrey in a breakthrough dramatic performance with this bit of tender wackiness we expect from him. Truman is an ordinary insurance salesman living in the small peaceful town of Seahaven. He's popular and lives in harmony with his wife, his mother, his best friend, his colleagues and neighbors. In appearance only  What Truman doesn't know, and here's the visionary originality on which relies his life, is that Seahaven, is in fact a huge studio with 5,000 cameras always keeping an eye on him and that everyone's an actor, including his wife, his mother, his best friend etc. and last but not least, all his life, was filmed since his birth to become the greatest and longest-running reality show in television history: 'The Truman Show'. Truman believed in a reality which is in fact, completely fictional, and all the protagonists of this pseudo reality, are puppets hanging on the string of the show's Creator who designs the perfect screenplay creating emotional cliffhangers for future episodes. The Creator is Kristoff, brilliantly portrayed by Ed Harris like a kind of almighty God, and the human incarnation of media's omnipotence. And Truman eventually realizes that his life is a huge hoax, and decides to leave the perfect utopia of Seahaven, and go discover the ""real"" world. Because that's the point: reality shows don't depict reality, but paint it with fiction, it's real fiction, but fiction nonetheless. The ambivalence is obvious in ""The Truman Show"". Truman's life is fictional, because all the protagonists play a role in order to create a story for the viewers. Viewers who follow the show like a soap opera with a 'realistic' dimension. Indeed, Truman's character is real, as stated by the creator of the show, he is the only ""real"" protagonist of this world, his reactions are spontaneous and sincere. The reality is pushed to (unscrupulous) limits, because unlike other shows, Truman doesn't know he's filmed, he's natural. His life is a fiction, but paradoxically a 'real' one. This is the semantic loophole, unscrupulous TV program managers use to justify the unrealistic aspect of their shows. The script's fascinating brilliance reminds of ""Network"" in the 70's, highlighting many unpleasant aspects of TV Reality, including the viewer's tacit complicity. Indeed, the viewer never minds the scripted aspect of reality as presented in TV programs as long as it improves his personal enjoyment, like for all these people who were assiduously following 'The Truman Show' in all over the world. The second aspect is the subjectivity of reality. Truman, for all his spontaneity and sincerity, was unknowingly following the storyline that producers traced. And all the situations were constructed to make him react according to a script. The process of mediation doesn't prevent from spontaneity, but it undermines its credibility by creating specific situations for premeditated reactions. Like in some programs where two people who don't appreciate each other or whose views totally differ, are both invited just to create a violent verbal confrontation -supposedly unexpected- to please the audience.Finally, the main lesson of the film lies on the climax where Truman, tries to leave the fictional world of Seahaven, materialized by the powerful symbol of a dome painted like a sky. Truman struggles to get outside before he faces the producer of the show. The latter warns him against the dangers of a hostile real world where truth is no worthier than elsewhere, and invites him to join the perfect utopia of Seahaven, where he's a hero. Truman's reaction is very symbolic. He left the cameras' world, like an artist who addresses his fans for the last time, with his famous catchphrase as a farewell, and finally gets out. This last pirouette, sublimated by the thrilling score of the film, earned him the applause of the audience, as if the excitement made them forget that the show was ending. Indeed, when the show was finally interrupted, two viewers quickly recovered from their emotions, and zapped to another program. The end. Truman is a genuine character, who understood the completely artificial status of his stardom. He therefore preferred to leave a charming utopia and face the real world. Television today launches ordinary people at the rank of stars for the simple reason that we, viewers, observed their everyday's moves, the details of their life's banality during weeks or months. But that kind of artificial popularity is inevitably ephemeral: it sinks into oblivion as soon as a new reality show emerges. And that's because camera's point view as depicted in the film, presents the reality in a dangerously subjective way. The 'staging', admitted by the public as it highlights positive values like friendship, fame, success, and empathy is a dangerous emotional depiction of reality. The risk is less for the viewer, who accepts the process, than for the protagonists of these emissions, whose purely artificial and prefabricated fame can lead to deep feelings of frustration later. The emotional excitement is binary, and plays on both positive and negative poles, it may present for the sake of transparency, real people who suffer and live under difficult conditions, whether in the context of stories, talk or reality shows. The danger here is moral, because with this constant clash between reality and fiction, how can we be sure that the depiction of suffering and frustration will inspire the audience positive psychological reactions like compassion and solidarity rather than a voyeuristic sadism mixed with a circumstantial empathy?""The Truman Show"", denounces the fictionalization of reality, through a remarkable fiction, that makes today's reality look like a less believable fiction",The Truman Show
39,bowmanblue,Life eventually imitated art?,9,6 November 2019,"I remember hearing the briefest of synopsis of 'The Truman Show' in a film magazine that was promoting the next year's upcoming movies. It just read, 'Jim Carrey discovers he's a character in a TV show.' I have to say that that description hardly blew me away as I didn't know what to make of it. Saying it like that makes it sound much more simple and goofy than it really is. I didn't go and see it when it was theatrically released, but after the positive word of mouth it generated, I felt I had to see it for myself.I can't really sum it up any better. Jim Carrey slowly discovers that the world around him is one giant TV set and he's the (unwitting) star, as cameras have been following his life ever since his birth. It was actually a pretty novel concept back in 1998. 'Big Brother' and various other reality TV shows had not yet taken over our airwaves, making this film quite ahead of its time.Carrey plays, 'Truman Burbank,' a happy-go-lucky fella who slowly starts to realise that there's something very wrong with the world and its inhabitants who exist all around him. From there, he slowly begins to unravel the plot for himself. It's all great fun and you really want to root for Truman to succeed in escaping this 'prison/goldfish bowl' he exists in. Jim Carrey is known for his 'larger than life' characters, but I'm pleased to say that he's dialed it down here and is much less manic than his other outings such as 'The Mask' or 'Ace Ventura.'Not just is it a quirky little drama, but it throws in many a dose of healthy social commentary of society and their obsession with television and the characters they spend their lives watching. However, I doubt that the film-makers ever realised how true to life this would all be with the amount of reality TV shows which were to follow it.Personally, I loved it and - despite it being a bit out of date now - I think it holds up perfectly as a warning of our obsession with TV. For what it's worth, I'll mention my friend's thoughts on it. He didn't like it because he thought it was all too far fetched. He felt that if the cameras had been following Truman since birth (approximately thirty years by the time we join him), that would mean the TV show started around 1968 and, back then, studios didn't have the technology to pull this off. I simply disregarded that as a nit-pick. This film is too good to look that deeply into and risk putting yourself off enjoying the ride.I guess I'll leave it up to its 'tagline' to say it best. 'On Air. Unaware.' Well done to the Marketing man who came up with that one!",The Truman Show

It shows the sadistic side of voyeurism, and it was obviously a harbinger of things to come, not just with reality TV, but with the loss of privacy in a world of ubiquitous cameras.

41,g-bodyl,Jim Carrey is.....Great!,9,15 March 2013,"The Truman Show is Jim Carrey's best movie hands-down. Not only do we see his usual comedic talent, but we also see some surprising dramatic chops from him. The first few minutes, I had no idea what was going on in the movie but by the end, I was amazed. I never thought Jim Carrey would put on a performance as he displayed here in the Truman Show.Unlike most Carrey movies, this movie has an actual plot and a really original one, at least it was back in 1998. This film is about a guy, Truman who is being filmed in part of a 24-hour reality TV show. But, he just believes he is an ordinary guy living a normal life. As time goes on, he believes to suspect that not all is ordinary.As I mentioned before, Jim Carrey is very, very good. But also deserving praise is Ed Harris as the show's creator. He played his role so well, I had to ask myself if he is the good guy or the bad guy and that usually never happens.Overall, this is a masterful film directed by Peter Weir. Both Weir and Harris are deserving of their Oscar nods. I truly wish that Carrey received one as well. The film holds up well as we move along in the 21st century. The visual effects and the way the movie was filmed regarding the Florida landscape was really done well. My favorite scenes in the movie were when the wife was talking as if she was an advertiser, but Truman never notices. I always found that funny. This is a funny, charming, and moving film that shows Carrey with a different side to himself. I rate this film 9/10.",The Truman Show
42,lesleyharris30,"A Clever, Unique, Well Acted Delight,",10,5 July 2010,"The Truman Show is a fantastic movie with an extremely well developed storyline and a stellar cast. You will never find a movie that is anything like it, it's incredibly unique, if any other film tried to imitate it they would be caught straight away, as we see a man's entire life filmed by a worldwide tekevsion show, unbeknownst to him. It really explores this interesting formula to a significant degree, unlike some movies that often fail to deliver their full potential, we see Truman disovering the truth about his world and struggling to uncover it, we also get to see the effect the Truman show has had on the world and, the most complex part of the film, how they have managed to make the show work for all the years of Truman's life, there was no aspect that felt unexplored. The cast is outstanding and were all very able to act with this unusual storyline, Jim Carrey delivers one of the finest roles of his career, being able to showcase his talent for both comedy and drama, he has some hilarious parts, but also plays a very complicated, complex character very effectively. Carrey is also joined by talents such as the great, underrated Ed Harris, playing a man obsesssd with the world he has created, Natascha McElhone shines as a woman who has fallen for a man she can never be with, while Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich play two actors struggling to hide the truth from Truman, stellar acting all around. Funny, dramatic, intense, whimsical and simply fun, I find it hard to understand what I have done to deserve a movie as beautiful as the Truman Show. Truman Burbank is a happily married salesman who soon starts to feel that the world revolves around him, however, what he does not know is he's the star of the worlds biggest reality show, as he was legally adopted by a television corporation.

44,ironhorse_iv,The Truman Show is truly in the limelight. It's worth viewing!,9,18 October 2020,"Inspired by 'The Twilight Zone' 1989 episode titled ""Special Service"". This 1998 comedy drama film directed by Peter Weir and written by Andrew Niccol tells the story of a well-liked small-town insurance salesman, Thurman Burbank (Jim Carrey) slowly finding out that his whole seemingly idyllic life has been a television sitcom that been airing globally around the clock. Without spoiling the movie too much, the influenced of classic 1950s good wholesome American values tv shows are very noticeable on the film's choose of locations, sets and costume design; along with the highly comedic satire style of camera work materialistic commercialism, included with the Cold War fear of visual eavesdropping. The motion picture truly does look like we're viewing our eyes through a colorful Norman Rockwell socially conservative painting at times under its many different surveillance like techniques. Even when the film is looked upon with modern day foresight. Seeing the film through pov cameras in buttons, car radios and mirrors was a very unique watch even if it's a bit over gimmicky and wonky at times. It really does mirror the rise of mass domestic surveillance within America during the late 20th century; as well as the public interest in straightforward voyeurism reality-based television like 'Big Brother'. Both eerily haunting and comedic satire foreshadowing. Well done shooting. Then there are religious analogies. While Truman is viewed from some audiences as Christ like. Even the scene where Truman walks along 'the sky' in the end makes it look like he's walking on water. I think he's more like Adam before the great awakening. The town of Seahaven can be viewed as the modern day Eden with the show creator Christof (Ed Harris) as the patriarchal overlord version of god from the old testament; trying to prevent the 'true man' from having too much free will and being enlighten from the dangerous temptations of the outside world by the woman in red Sylvia (Natascha McElhone), the Eve of the story. Much like Yahweh and the stories of the Great Flood, Christof kept Truman in check by instilling Aquaphobia fears. Other people viewed this act more as a false god or antichrist like the antagonist name suggest, because the deceitful ways he operates. Regardless I'm not really please with those audience members who has taken this movie's interpretations to the extreme often with antisemitism or racist results. I doubt that hatred for a certain people or religion is what the film was going for. Despite that horrible thinking from some, the visuals of Christof's backstage control room are just as rich as the Seahaven set. After all, it has a cameo of composer Philip Glass playing the piano. His score for the film was beautiful. Anyways, you also start to notice a lot more subtle hints that something is not quite right with the studio production in the moon. Foremost, the idea that Christof's value his privacy so much over others to the point, that he crafty hangs up calls from the Hague in order to avoid facing different international judicial bodies for the human rights violations shows how self-sighted he is. The legal problems must be so vast that employees of his are viewing the classifies for other means of work. To add onto that, the majority of the mishaps that happen in the film can be explained by the creator's lazy short sights such as the lack of updating the dome like unfinished bridges to mean Truman's modern standards and allowing camera crew to fool around with basketball hoops and treadmill while working. Along with that, the whole Tru Talk sequence with Christof really does explained a lot without going overboard into lecture dump territory. It gave enough information to suspend our disbelief even if producing a show like this is nearly impossible. It was so well done that the filmmakers use part of the interview for the opening, along with other footage of the inworld cast talking about their roles in a once separate marketing behind the screen mockumentary. While this decision kinda does hurt the suspense as the audience is waiting a while for Burbank to catch up. Revealing Truman's world as a show in the beginning was indeed the right choice. In truth, the filmmakers made a lot of good decisions in the editing like cutting away jarring moments like Truman confronting another homeless person. Honestly if they kept that scene, it would be super weird to think that the creator would allow performers to portray homeless people; seeing that Christof wanted Seahaven to seem like the ideal utopia. Wouldn't many of the show commerical sponsors be against that idea? Anyways, they made the right decision to have the real homeless guy Kirk (Brian Delate) just break into on set, instead of portraying one. Other story changes that work well was getting rid of the teenaged angst version of Thurman in a metropolis like urban settling with the staged rape scene and a boy dying from a car wreck. That's pretty dark. It's disturbing enough to see Thurman overly obsessed and desire a woman he only met one day. Seeing him stalk and make a photo of worship of her was a bit too much. Nevertheless, another great choice the filmmaker did was getting rid of actor Dennis Hooper in the antagonist and replacing him with Harris even if Ed wanted Christof to be a hunchback. Regardless the acting from all the cast was great. Another great decision was inserting moments of outside dome fans watching the show. While the structure can be seemed somewhat fragmented because of that. Nevertheless, it does enhance the film experience; especially in the Plato's ""The Allegory of the cave"" type ending. You'll find yourself rooting for Truman due to herd mentality by the end. The flick was so popular that even a syndrome was named after this movie. Overall: be adventurous, spontaneous & check this film out. It will certainly be worth your time.",The Truman Show
45,nairtejas,One Word: EPIC! ♦ 91%,9,14 July 2013,"The first 20 minutes are boring and those consume the 9% of my rating aggregate. The remaining 80 minutes are EPIC.Starting off like any other drama film, The Truman Show talks about the story of an ordinary man. But, as the plot advances and as the character grows up, psychologically, things seem to take a reality check. Throughout the realization & final mission, you stick to your seat, most of your senses concentrating on what might happen next. Twists & turns start to come up and you stay mesmerized.Jim Carrey has won the Oscar, at least for me. His slapstick is improbable but funny. His portrayal is full of originality. Supporting cast act very well. Music symphonies provide a strong score and the screenplay just completes the classic.I can watch this more and more and still stay baffled at the unwinding of plot.

46,The-Sarkologist,A movie about control and the illusion of freedom,9,25 December 2013,"The Truman Show is a movie that is simply brilliant. The more I think about this movie the more I seem to see in it. Its ending left me totally stunned and the entire movie is pure originality and it is made in a way that you are not sure of how it is going to end.The Truman Show is a television program that is focused around one man, Truman Burbank (Jim Carey). He has no idea that he is the star of a television program and he simply goes about life as if it was his life. The show goes for twenty four hours a day, seven days a week with no breaks. Advertising is made a part of the show, and is blatant to the audience but Truman simply does not think there is that much strange about it. The show takes place inside a huge dome, called the Hollywood dome, that surrounds a beautiful beach town. At one time Truman has wanted to leave the town, but they have always found ways to keep him inside. They decided that the best way was to give him a phobia about water as the town has been built on an island. So they killed his father while on a boating trip.The movie is about control, they say so at the beginning. Though Truman is not supposed to know that he is living in a television show, they try to make sure that every aspect of his life is controlled. The first realization of this is when he catches the eye of one woman and he decides that he wants to get to know her better. But Christof (Ed Harris) the director prevents this by sending another woman to him that he is going to marry. Once that happens, his next goal is for Truman it impregnate his wife, but the problem is that he does not love her and because he does not love her he has no desire to have children with her. He is still very much in love with the woman who he glimpsed for a second.Another way they control Truman to keep him in the town is through subtle things like a job, friends, and a mortgage. He wants dearly to go to Fiji, because he believes the woman he loves is there, but he can't go. He has a mortgage on the house and the car making money tight. When he does try to go more problems begin, like the bus breaking down, a forest fire, and finally a nuclear meltdown. In this movie there is no coincidence, and you realize this when everything seems to happen to push Truman in a particular way. It seems that it is real life, but we see through the façade when we know that everything in Truman's world is controlled.It is interesting though to consider whether this is reflected onto our world. The Truman Show seems to be a cry out for freedom and individuality. In one aspect it could be a movie of rebellion against God. Screaming that God has no right to control our lives and that we should be able to do what we want. Another aspect is that it is an attack against the government, which I think is more so. The government seeks to control people's lives but there is a cry that the government limit itself and give us our freedom to do what we want. In a way, the Truman show seems to be like 1984, where Big Brother knows everything about us.As for rebelling against God's control, we must remember that God has given us a free choice of turning away from him. Truman has no choice whether he wants to stay or go. No matter how hard Truman tries to leave, Christof refuses to let him go. God does control the universe, and he does everything for our own good. Christof claims the same for Truman, but Truman has no choice, we do. Truman does not know the truth, we do. Truman believes everything in the dome is real, where it is not. God has revealed himself and his plan to us in the bible and thus we are able to make a choice based on that.Another aspect is privacy. In the Truman show there is none. Truman does not have a private life, even though he thinks he does. Every action, everything that he does is watched by millions of people world wide. His funny things in the bathroom are a private matter to him, but people watch him and laugh at his antics.It is also interesting to note that Truman has no friends. Everybody around him is there because they are being paid to be there. His best friend never says anything from his heart but from the mouth of Christof. His wife does not love him, and does not even consider their marriage legitimate because she crossed her fingers when she made the vows. As such the life of Truman becomes a sad, lonely, and false life. Though he believes that he has friends, he does not and if all were to go away, he would in the end be left with nobody.The Truman Show is simply one awesome movie. It is one that I would put up in the region of the classics. It stands alone with its plot and its story, and it takes on board some very deep themes.",The Truman Show

Plot In A Paragraph: Truman Burbank (a brilliant Jim Carrey) an advertising salesman is totally unaware that his entire life is staged for a TV showEd Harris was rightly nominated for an Oscar for his work here, but how could the Academy ignore Jim Carrey here?? He is fantastic! Playing it straight and totally against type Carrey shines and gives a performance with an amazing amount of heart. Laura Linney does well as Meryl, Trumans wife while Natasha McElhone is a joy as Lauren/Sylvia and Holland Taylor is her usual brilliant self.

Knowing the premise, I was interested to see how they were going to justify the story.The film is actually incredibly well set-up, explaining in detail how it was possible for Truman to never explore the world. Jim Carrey is also perfectly cast as Truman, and he completely sold his character to me in a not-so-over-the-top comedic and also somewhat dramatic performance. The more I watched, the more addicted I became - like a soapie. This was the whole idea of the movie and it effectively came across as such.Ed Harris is also great in his role as the film's antagonist. 'The Truman Show' is an interesting concept, and they manage to pull it off perfectly. The film also has a beautiful score. Good ending.",The Truman Show
49,briancham1994,Imaginative premise brought to life by Jim Carrey's performance,8,29 May 2021,"This film takes a premise that has often come into our imaginations - what if we're all in a TV show? - and brings the entire scenario to life in a dystopian near future. The constant tension between the inquisitive Truman Burbank and the odd happenings in Sea Haven create an eerie mystery that unfolds over the course of the movie. Everything around him is totally documented and controlled, a prescient depiction of reality TV and internet culture (Chris-Chan comes to mind as the closest real equivalent). This theme of paranoia, illusion and exploitation drew natural comparisons to deeper themes of life alienation. All of this was only possible by the great performance of Jim Carrey who found the perfect balance of goofy comedy and relatable everyman. This film's triumph is in presenting such provoking ideas in an endearing and entertaining package.",The Truman Show

51,Dr_Coulardeau,One puppet for the perverse pleasure of all others,10,10 November 2017,"This is an intriguing film. Truman is in his mid or late 20s when we get to him in the present. The idea is that he was one of several children born from mothers who gave away their children for adoption at birth. He was the first one to be born and as such became adopted by the corporation represented by Christof, the director or this show. Suspend your disbelief a lot because the fact that he lived in this artificial cinema setting all his life, which means went to school on a daily basis and to college to get his qualification for his job, is a pure illusionary impossibility. It is maybe easier to make a few hundred people live in this community with only one real inhabitant, Truman, and all the others actors who have to be unionized in a way or another and hence cannot work more than a certain certainly limited number of hours a day and a week and a month and a year. And what about the population of a school from grade 1 to grade 12, not to speak of the full population of a college. I will not consider the legal side of things. This abduction and total retention of a minor and then an adult in an artificial environment is pure imprisonment, which means totally illegal, and when Christof says Truman could leave anytime he wanted, it is an absolute lie since when Truman finally tries he is nearly killed by Christof's own decisions and acts. That amounts to the inhumane torturing of a grown up by another grownup with a whole bunch of accomplices pushing the buttons. This has to be said because everything in this show is REAL, really REAL. Not just Truman, but all the others. They are maybe a fake illusion for Truman but they are real actors and actresses, really acting on command, prompted by earplugs in constant relation with the studio. Instances of Christof's dictating to an actor what he had to say is even provided. It is all an illusion and a delusion for Truman, but it is all true. And I repeat totally impossible because beyond any material credibility and what's more beyond any human rights as for Truman, and in fact as for everyone in the film. Apart from Truman, they all behave either as criminals or accomplices of criminals.But we have to accept to enter the film to find a deeper meaning in the story.The first element is the delusional world in which Truman is forced to live. It has one motto written on a couple of arches: ""Unus pro Omnibus, Omnes pro Uno."" This motto is old and was first used within some religious conflict in Bohemia in 1618. It is also a traditional motto in Switzerland, but not in Latin. In German ""Einer für alle, Alle für einen."" In French ""Un pour tous, tous pour un."" In Italian ""Uno per tutti, tutti per uno."" And in Romansch ""In per tuts, tuts per in."" The motto is generally translated into English as ""One for all, all for one."" It is particularly famous because it is the motto of the famed and heroic though hilarious (three) Musketeers staged by Alexandre Dumas along with d'Artagnan. This motto is immediately visually amplified by the name of the store on the corner of the street in front of these arches, Omnicol, though I do not know what this store might be selling.This motto is very ethical and is obviously in full contradiction with real life where it is always everyone for oneself. This community, Seahaven, the very well named place because it is a haven and even a heavenly haven to its residents. Imagine keeping up with this illusion that this is a harbor (Le Havre in France) on a sea with no possible traffic, ships, and even the ferry is only a prop on the set. The only boat ever really shown is the boat in which Truman's father will die in a storm in front of Truman's eyes. And then at the end, the second boat will be Truman's escape boat in which he will nearly die by the decision of Christof himself who could not accept the escape with a cynical remark of his that sounds like a death sentence: Network Executive: For God's sake, Chris! The whole world is watching. We can't let him die in front of a live audience! Christof: He was born in front of a live audience.At this moment Christof himself is showing the reverse motto: everyone is supposed to do what he wants, even Truman who may die if necessary to satisfy the selfish ambition of the power freak and the control freak Christof is. His name is the very antagonistic reference to Christ – he is an Antichrist – who is supposed to die for everyone and not the reverse. In fact, he is more like Ponce Pilate, thus turning Truman into the Christ of the story to be sacrificed for the interest of the show that is supposed not to die, since the show must go on, as Shakespeare said a long time ago. But this is a film and that's what makes the show a pure fable. The director of the film systematically creates a distance between Truman's experience and ours, the audience's experience, of Truman's fate. The public is shown as having a tremendous level of empathy for that young man who is going to be sacrificed on the altar of a reality TV show. [. . . ]Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",The Truman Show
52,zkonedog,A Film Ahead Of Its Time,10,10 March 2017,"When ""The Truman Show"" hit theaters in the summer of 1998, there was no such thing as reality TV. ""Survivor"", ""Big Brother"", ""Amazing Race"", or ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians""? All in the future. The fact that this film beat America to the reality-TV punch shows how much of a landmark production it truly was--ahead of its time, to be sure.For a basic plot summary, ""The Truman Show"" tells the story of Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey), a seemingly regular guy who begins to suspect that his life is being controlled by forces outside of his own. As it turns out, his life (from birth) has been viewed by the TV-watching public since birth, with everyone in on the idea except him. That includes his wife (Laura Linney), best friend (Noah Emmerich), and even an old flame (Natascha McElhone) intent on revealing the mystery once Truman starts putting the pieces together and ultimately discovers how manipulated his life truly is. But not if enigmatic director Christof (Ed Harris) has anything to say about it.""Truman Show"" is a concept movie through-and-through. It really nails the concept of ""reality TV"" & just how pervasive commercialism can become in our society. As previously mentioned, this film was years ahead of its time in portraying such issues. As such, in way the experience actually resonates more today than it ever could have in '98.The acting helps the production rise above just the concept as well. Carrey completely and utterly sheds his more farcical comedic roles and turns in an Oscar-worthy performance as the befuddled Truman, while the auxiliary roles are finely-tuned as well. Director Peter Weir will have you truly caring about the little town of Seahaven Island and its inhabitants by the film's conclusion.I consider ""The Truman Show"" to be one of the finest films of all-time. It has everything a great movie needs...intriguing plot, good pacing, solid acting, investing characters, and even a little humor thrown in here and there. Not only does it work on its surface level, but it also expertly presages a digital, commercialist, voyeuristic culture--all avenues that seemed to be moving closer to a societal reality.",The Truman Show
53,filipemanuelneto,"Provocative and philosophical, this film is not for every stomach.",8,29 November 2016,"This is a film that is uncomfortable and difficult to digest because it weaves hard social criticism. Life in that seaside city represents the reality that we want to show to others, as if we live by appearances (we actually live). It is an ideal city, perfect, calm, without trash, without crime, without poverty, where all are good friends but there is no relation of closeness or friendship, or anger or rancor... no trace of humanity, in the good or the Bad sense of the term. And Truman Burbank is the symbol of an artificial human being in an artificial world. It is this artificiality latent in everything that bothers, always bothered the character who, after all, is unaware of being part of a millionaire reality show, which transmitted to the world every moment of his life. And here lies another important provocation essential to understanding the film: a critique of the kind of TV shows we watch, programs that exploit and make millions at the expense of people's weaknesses and pains. The film also makes some surreptitious and highly philosophical considerations, equating the nature of God, the size of the Universe, the reason for Man's existence. The film develops well, around Truman's quest for truth behind the apparent lie where he lives.Jim Carrey is the big name of this movie. He does an excellent job and proves to us that he can also be serious and dramatic. However, he may have disappointed some audiences who went to see this movie expecting another comedy. He shone in this dramatic role, is almost always present and succeeds, even in the serious context of the film, to look nice and play without getting to the point of idiocy. Ed Harris also shone in the role of the director of the television program, always trying to keep his star. It's a side supporting role, but Harris knew how to ennoble your character with a job well done.This is a complex and provocative film, but it hides behind a relatively simple story and great humility. It is not an elaborate production, it does not seem to me to have been expensive nor does it have huge special or visual effects. Everything is done with discretion but efficiency. However, it is not a movie for anyone. It's funny without being funny because it's not the humor that makes the movie work. It leaves a lot open, leaves many questions and reflections in our head. For some, it will be a boring movie.",The Truman Show
54,TheMovieDiorama,The Truman Show proves that an original concept can provide an innovative and engaging story.,9,27 February 2018,"In a time where the UK has 'The Only Way Is Essex', 'Geordie Shore' and 'Made in Chelsea', reality TV shows are a massive hit. I wish they weren't, but they are. It's clear to see why. Observing the lives of others on a routinely basis makes you feel like you know them on a personal level. The same applies to this film. Truman Burbank is unknowingly in a hit reality show where his life and world is fabricated. He starts to find odd idiosyncrasies in his day to day routine that makes him question the legitimacy of his world. Straight up, this is Jim Carrey's best film and best performance. He controls his usual animated comedic mannerisms to create an understated and emotionally captivating performance. Peter Weir's direction is also compelling, utilising hidden cameras in this false reality to enhance the TV show-like qualities, making the experience feel real. But what really puts The Truman Show on the map is the concept. I've seen this a good few times, and every single viewing gives me a sense of euphoria. The ending might be slightly underwhelming but when we get to the final five minutes, it's like we've completed a quest! Me and Truman, together. The narrative evokes many themes. The idea of our lives being dictated by a higher power. The right to have the freedom of choice. Exploring the concept of fate and destiny. Is it subtle? No, but it doesn't need to be. That's the point of the plot. I adored the small details that reality shows include, like product placements. Laura Linney staring at the camera talking about cocoa...it's a thing of beauty and kinda makes me want to buy some. The natural progression of Truman discovering unusual happenings was well paced and all the loose ends were tied up nicely.

Clearly, this is not a realist film, but if the production of something like The Truman Show were possible, literally and legally, this is probably about what it would look like. However, given the relatively exciting reality of everyday life (exactly what the movies are there to help us escape from),  I doubt that the show would be quite so widely followed, or that it would have such an obsessive fan base. This is a very challenging type of movie to make, and the effectiveness of it reflects the skill of the films creators. As was the case with the Back To The Future series, all of the obvious problems with such a concept are dealt with and the ways that they are solved are explained in the film. You have people trying to let Truman know that his whole life is televised, you have his deathly fear of water (stemming from his father's `drowning' and explaining his failure to leave his happy home even once during his entire life),  and you have things like Truman hearing people on his car radio as they follow his every move, lights falling from the ceiling of the soundstage, etc. All of the close calls' that you would expect to happen when keeping someone unknowingly trapped in a confined space are presented, and when Truman starts to catch on to the whole thing, the movie really takes off and starts getting really exciting. The Truman Show allows Jim Carrey to engage in several different kinds of acting, even, although briefly, the goofy comedy that he is best known for. But here, he introduces a new kind of comedic acting (at least new for himself), in which he goes along with strange things and pretends not to be weirded out, such as when his wife shows him what she bought at the supermarket, explaining all of its qualities exactly like a TV commercial (`Wow. That's amazing!'), which is intentional because the product placement is the only way to have any kind of commercial in The Truman Show, which runs 24 hours a day. This is tied in with his suspicions about what is really going on when it happens one time in the kitchen of his home, and his wife is talking like a commercial again. This time, Truman comes out and finally speaks what has been on his mind for so long, in a bit of hilarious dialogue that is very effective in the near-thriller story that follows (`What the hell are you talking about? Who are you talking to?!').
When Truman seems to lose it and attack his wife, she screams `Do something!!' and Truman's suspicion's are confirmed. This is a significant scene because not only is Jim Carrey not giving us goofball comedy, but he actually appears menacing, which is totally unexpected given his iconography. Laura Linney plays the role of his intolerably tolerable wife with the incessant smile, and Ed Harris fills in the role of the producer of The Truman Show, in an uncharacteristic but very effective performance. This film is a great example of how an impossible story can be made to work and be fun. Peter Weir lends his direction skills to this unique story, and with great success.",The Truman Show
58,imseeg,Wonderful!,8,22 May 2020,"Still stands strong after so many decades. One must remember this movie was made in the nineties, when reality tv and the internet were only just about to get more common, but many many people didnt have the internet yet and reality tv was the exception to the rule. But despite everything being filmed nowadays this movie about reality tv is still powerful and wonderful.The good: the story is beautifully written, wonderfully directed and terrifically acted by Jim Carrey.Any bad? None. It's simply a delightful story to watch.The story: Jim Carey is UNKNOWINGLY starring in a reality tv show. The whole world he lives in is fake.

59,FiendishDramaturgy,"Everyone raves over it, but I think this is where he started going down.",5,17 March 2007,"This is one of those times when I must differ with other reviewers. I didn't like this one. I support Carrey's attempt to jump into another genre, and the work itself is awesome. Carrey's performance clearly rocks. But the whole premise was affronting. I, frankly, hated this movie. Carrey's performance makes it worth the hype, but the story itself was a cold, calculating, cashing-in of the talent, and I can not find anything enjoyable about that.This work was clearly intended to make you think. It endears you to the main character (Carrey), introduces its premise (which was refreshingly new), and then lowers the boom. It was the boom I couldn't swallow. I found this work horribly disturbing, and just plain sad.Frankly, in spite of the glowing reviews and excellent numbers this work received, I believe this is the pinpoint of the decline of Carrey's career. I hope he pulls out of it, or soon he'll just be another washed-up comedian.It rates a 4.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",The Truman Show
60,vivianla,New Views,8,2 June 2020,"This film is so interesting - it has given me new ideas and views. A man named Truman's entire life since he was in the womb has been on television, watched by each individual in the world's population. A pretty girl who catches his eye and then later sees while studying gives him hints about his actual life. The fashion in this film is pretty good. Truman's best friend has a tall, masculine vibe that is cute and has broad shoulders. He is ""in it"" as well. Every move and thought of Truman's is used to direct the actors. Truman is overwhelmed by this knowledge that his entire life may have been a movie and tries to outsmart the director by making unpredictable thoughts and actions. He becomes spontaneous and tries to catch anyone off guard and does succeed a few times. The elevator scene, his wife's reasoning of the elevator, etc. Cars and people move for him so he does not get hurt. I really like this film - it gave me a new way to look at things.The director speaks to Truman as if he is god when Truman reaches the border of this unreality. The world is divided in half as we see on a map shown. The sun, sky, weather, waves can all be controlled. When Truman figures out to leave this world by going through the door the audience and the pretty girl cheers, happy for him.Two officers who watch the ending cheer then simply looks for a new show to watch.This film is so thought-provoking. It makes me think how supposedly god knows our every action taken on our behalf just like the director and proceeds to direct our life depending on the intentions.",The Truman Show
61,Coxer99,The Truman Show,8,28 June 1999,"Marvelous film that mirrors the directorial touches of Capra or Sturges and the fantastical writings of Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond. Peter Weir's film of Truman Burbank, the unwitting star of his own real life television show, where every moment of every day of his entire life has been filmed is an original slice of life, catapulted by an outstanding performance by Jim Carrey (who was snubbed...Yes, by you Oscar!)as Truman, who discovers what is happening to him and searches for the truth.",The Truman Show
62,jimbo-53-186511,"Clever, touching, and quite simply a brilliant piece of film-making",8,18 March 2014,"The Truman Show focuses on the life of Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) who is an ordinary guy working as a Loss Adjustor. However, he is unaware that his whole life has been turned into a TV show in which every move he makes and everything he says is being observed by millions of people around the world. Following a chance encounter, Truman begins to realise that everything isn't as it seems and that maybe his life isn't quite as ordinary as he first thought.I'm a big fan of Jim Carrey, but for some reason this is one film that I've overlooked since its release in 1998. The concept of the film is interesting and I have a feeling that this film will age rather well. At the moment we are in the grip of several reality shows and the Truman Show, in parts, clearly satirises the reality show genres. The camera cuts from time to time to show various groups of people utterly engrossed in what they are watching - this element is believable as I honestly do believe that there are people who can't do without their fix of Made In Chelsea or The Only Way is Essex (UK reality shows)or Keeping Up With the Kardashians as an American equivalent. The Truman Show demonstrates this in a humorous, but subtle manner.The Truman Show for me just seemed to get everything right; the script was intelligent, but it was also cohesive. The plot was straight forward, but it also managed to be touching and moving. Truman Burbank was such a likable person that it's impossible not to care for his character. About halfway through the film there is a 5 minute segment which explains how the Truman Show came about and once you know the 'truth' about Truman you'll care for both him and his cause all the more.Jim Carrey proves here that he is a much more talented actor than some give him credit for. His zany OTT comedic acting style that we've seen in films such as 'The Mask', 'Liar Liar' and the Ace Ventura films are certainly not to everyone's taste, but I happen to like this style of acting and think he's a very funny man. Carrey gives a much more restrained performance here and his performance perfectly suits the tone of this film. Carrey's strong performance and tight script combine together to make this a pretty much flawless film. The cinematography and directing were also top notch. Ed Harris was also superb as the Creator/Director, but he's only given limited screen time.The ending of the film was suitably uplifting and I can honestly say that this is one of the few films I've seen where I didn't want it to end. The Truman Show is a wonderful film which combines humour, satire, intelligence, a good script, and also manages to be touching and uplifting. It's a rare example of a film which not only felt too short, but also left me with a big smile on my face. The Truman Show is a film that simply has to be seen.",The Truman Show

65,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Timeless classic,10,15 August 2016,"Everyone at some point in their lives has been bothered by the notion that their surroundings are all an elaborate prank, that somehow every single human being but them is in on some giant impossible joke, watching their every move for strange and unthinkable purposes. What if my life isn't real? What if all my friends and family members aren't who they say they are, and I'm just part of some ungodly social experiment? What if my life as I've known it just isn't.. real? For Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) these concerns are very pressing, as he discovers throughout one of the most thoughtful, touching, creative and insightful films ever made. Director Peter Weir works with a script by Andrew Niccol to bring us this now timeless tale of a man existing in a patented pastel world that was never his own and always destined for him. Truman is the unwitting star of his own television show, inducted into its gargantuan studio set since the day of his birth, and conditioned to believe all his life that the people, places and events around him are in fact his real life. Cruel? Perhaps, but the film never takes sides, instead favoring wonder over analytical dissection, a wise move. Even the conductor of this whole absurd symphony, a prolific filmmaker played by Ed Harris, gets his moment of sympathy which can be read as preening ego or the desire to connect with his leading actor beyond the pixelated jumbo- tron he sits behind, depending on how you view the situation. Truman has a lovely wife (Laura Linney), a salt of the earth best friend (Noah Emmerich) and the perfect little white picket fence life. But none of it is real, or at least organic in the sense that every person deserves out of the womb. Truman is a rat in a very elaborate maze, but like anyone who's had the wool pulled over their eyes, eventually he begins to see lights of authenticity piercing the seams. Gradually he begins to sniff out the ruse, like a child losing their innocence, and questions the eerily idyllic life he has been given. The people, or rather, actors in his life react in different ways. Some panic, others stick to the script, and Harris sorrowfully watches his controversial creation awaken beyond his control. Carrey is a starry eyed revelation as Truman, in one of the most overlooked performances of the century. His arc is the stuff of dreams, spanning the lengths of naivete trapped in a bubble that bursts into affecting, starry eyed realization and wonder. Every moment is owned by him, every beat is resoundingly hit in flawless fashion. When a mysterious and beautiful defector (the luminous Natasha Mcelhone) enters his life to play the part of whistle-blower, it's the first genuine and non-puppeteered interaction he's had with a human being. Sparks fly high enough to reach the heavens, and it's the catalyst for a journey to find the self, the reason for his predicament, a world beyond the Lego brick suburbia he has known and the next step in his impossibly unique life. There's a piece of Truman embedded in every viewer beholding, and I believe that's why the film has held up for so long, and been beloved by so many. Every human being has insecurities as large as the fake sound stage that raised him from a pup. Every one of us has at one point felt the alienation he must have gone through upon realizing the truth. In a story so larger than life, we find the answers, or at least a modicum of such, to what it means being a person in this world. Carrey's Truman is an achingly relatable avatar of this and a direct conduit into the essential. Couldn't have picked a better actor to bring all of this to life. Couldn't have made a better film about it. A classic. Good morning, and in case I don't see you: good afternoon, good evening and goodnight.",The Truman Show

68,slokes,Reality...What A Concept,7,5 March 2006,"Haven't you ever wondered what it would be like to be the star of your very own ""Truman Show""? Have you ever wondered if you in fact are?Imagine for a moment a documentary, featuring one Debbie Samuels who you remember as that girl you liked in the ninth grade and once thought she liked you. Only here she is a disgruntled ex-actress named Morgana Windemere, who complains about how the writers once told her to give you significant glances, then suddenly decided to ""go in a different direction.""""I thought I was going to be the co-star, you know, the girlfriend, but then they said I wasn't working. Even though HE liked me. They made me snub him in the cafeteria and then said my family moved to Canada. Not even a farewell episode."" Elsewhere on the show, onetime childhood bullies complain about the unlovable characters they had to portray. ""All the writers ever did with that guy was have us beat him up,"" one complains. ""They said it was good for the ratings."" The concept of ""The Truman Show"" is a lot of fun. Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, who gradually comes to realize he is in fact being watched by everyone in the sheltered community of Shorehaven where he has spent all his life. Indeed, there is a reason why Truman's wife approvingly holds up household products in the middle of dinner conversations, and why the travel agency features posters showing planes struck by lightning: He is the unknowing star of his own sitcom.I wish I enjoyed the movie as much. Though funny in parts, it is more of a wet-eyed spectacle featuring an often-serious Jim Carrey staring upward in one of those ""what-does-it-all-mean"" poses that has marked too much of director Peter Weir's work since ""Dead Poets' Society. Aiming for maximum uplift, the film sometimes forgets to keep its feet on the ground.The film is in many ways like ""Being There,"" the fragile but brilliant Peter Sellers comedy with a similarly minor key classical music score. But ""The Truman Show"" is less sure of what it wants to be. At times, it's a broad satire on modern life, like when Truman watches people walking by his house and figures out they are on a loop. At other times, it goes for a more realistic bent, with a group of people who advocate Truman's release (including Natascha McElhone as Lauren, Truman's version of my Debbie Samuels) and a headstrong director with a God complex, named Christof naturally enough and played by Ed Harris.""We know how jealously you guard your privacy,"" a smug TV commentator (Harry Shearer) begins a rare interview with Christof, ironic of course given Christof's treatment of Truman.More comedy could have been mined from the concept of Truman, but comedy is not Weir's forte and except for that travel agency and a scene where Truman watches his wife in surgery, the film plays it straight.Still, Truman makes you think even if it doesn't make you laugh, and there's a satisfying conclusion that teases out the metaphysical concepts the movie has played with all along. It's manipulative, yes, but genuinely clever. If it doesn't make you look extra hard in your bathroom mirror the next morning, maybe you're just looking into the wrong camera.",The Truman Show
69,gcd70,It's all about you,6,4 March 2010,"Peter Weir's film, ""The Truman Show"", definitely lacks no innovation, bringing us as it does the unique story of a man who is the central character in an amazingly long-running television show that is all about him. Only catch is, he doesn't know it.We have probably all felt that our lives were on show at one time or another, or even imagined that we were the centre of some great movie. I must admit to imagining myself in a situation just like Truman's. I never expected it to become the subject matter of a movie though. It is probably no wonder that Aussie director Weir jumped at it.Weir does a pretty good job creating the world in which Truman Burbank lives (maybe a reference to Burbank studios in that name), giving us a pseudo-reality of which we are completely aware, but of which Truman has no concept. Weir's problems start when he has to decide where to take this ground-breaking film. Like Peter Howitt's ""Sliding Doors"", it is very difficult to know how to close a movie whose very concept is capable of totally wowing its audience. Many may be disappointed with this film's finale, and some may even feel cheated out of a true ending. Others will cheer; it's all down to personal taste.Jim Carrey, upon whom the entire show rides, impresses often as the bright, cheery insurance salesman who starts to believe there may be something very wrong with his world. He certainly has the right amount of charisma, though whether his dramatic prowess was strong enough is debatable. Perhaps a classic actor would have done something completely different with this role. Support cast are merely incidental, but include Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Ed Harris, Hollard Taylor and Natascha McElhone.Highly effective music comes from original composer Burkhard Dallwitz with additional pieces from Philip Glass.

On every singular level this film works astoundly- jim Carrey provides a pitch perfect performance as our titular star Truman Burbank- in an incredible casting decision that I am sure turned a lot of heads at the time. Yes we see some of that classic Carrey throughout the film- but the man can act, and never before had it been brought to such attention as it had with this film- and he captures his role perfectly. The other actors do an excellent job as well, namely Ed Harris and Natascha McElhone- as well as Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich. The direction is fantastic, and much needed for the creative vision of the film at hand. The script is not only well done, but incredibly thought provoking, original, and brilliantly put into flm format. The music is fantastic, letting us feel so much emotion from such simple and classic pieces of work. The pacing is excellent, and the film leaves you with a smile and you wanting more- as I think any good film should. In the end, I have absolutely no complaints about The Truman Show. I've seen it more times than I can count, and it's easily one of my favorite films out there. Its a creative masterpiece that is unlike anything we would ever see today, or anything before it.

Eternal Sunshine is a phenomenal film and he gives a great performance and there's also this. The Truman Show is a remarkably great film from a seriously underrated actor that comments heavily on our consumption and obsession with media. I feel like it's more relevant even now than it was then thanks to the advent of social media because I can only imagine how some people feel as though their whole life is being scripted and obsessed over by thousands of people.

He has been filmed since his days in the womb in the style of 'Big Brother' and he's only just started to suspect that life's not what he thinks it is.The film is very cleverly made, with great use of angles and filters to give the impression of various cameras and the use of Truman's audience to give balance with the real world helps to bring the show to life too. The product placement advertising also makes me laugh.It's probably my favourite Carrey film, as I'm not usually a fan of his and although he only has a relatively small part, Ed Harris gives a great performance too.Can you imagine if they tried to do this today for real?

75,triple8,a movie so unique one wonders how it got made.,10,14 March 2005,"SPOILERS THROUGHOUT:Truman Show is without a doubt Carey's best work. I did not have the pleasure of seeing this until this year, where after seeing Bruce Almighty and becoming somewhat of a Jim Carey fan, I made an effort to watch more of his movies. Truman Show is an instant classic in all the right ways, it's a smart, well acted, somewhat eerie, and utterly unique masterpiece. It also gets better the more you watch it.I don't happen to like the genre of science fiction and nobody could deny Truman Show's got a bit of sci fi but I don't think it really falls under any one genre. What's really scary is the idea-this concept-is not so out there anymore, in today's times, that one could completely rule out that this could ever happen. It's creepy, very much so, in the way that The Original Stepford Wives is but more so in a way, and I wonder about what would be said about the movie had it been released currently, instead of the late 90's when reality TV was just starting to cause a ripple.I first started changing my thoughts on Carey after Bruce Almighty, a great movie (and one that is a lot more thought provoking then many give it credit for.) But as good as he was in that, he simply shines in Truman, everyone does, I loved Laura Linney as Truman's annoying, cold on screen wife Meryl. I've seen many of Linney's movies, this is one of her best.I'd advise people who haven't seen Truman Show to see it more then once-the first time I saw it, I thought it was about an 8 or 9, it grows on you and it's the kind of movie you want to see again as soon as it ends. There are a few frustrating things to be sure, I wish it had not ended so ambiguously, I'd have liked to see more of Truman's life after leaving the set, his relationship with Sylvia and what the other characters were feeling gone into a bit more. Also the audience. Was Truman an instant celebrity when he left or was he quickly forgotten in favor of the next flavor of the month by his devoted audience as is a bit inferred? Truman Show, unlike about 95 percent of movies made, does seem like a sequel could be made, although with how bad most sequels are I'd be a bit wary. Still, any flaws are not enough to prevent a 10 of 10 rating from me, you could be watching this movie for the 50th time and it still seems like it would inspire the same reaction.",The Truman Show
76,Spleen,Damned near perfect.,10,18 February 2000,"My only gripe is the product placement gag, intended to be surreal, but in fact prosaic - as well as silly.  Surely the evil genius behind The Truman Show would have come up with a more creative source of funding...?But we're talking about, what, thirty seconds of footage?  Apart from this `The Truman Show' is a film so finely crafted it sings.  Lovely to look at and intelligent as well.  One of the two peaks of science fiction cinema of the 1990s (the other was `Twelve Monkeys'), but this rather understates the case.  Jim Carrey was inspired casting.  I don't care whether he's technically speaking a good actor or not - he might as well be, since he's perfect as the hothouse-produced Truman Burbank, who doesn't know he's performing in front of a huge audience but who's unconsciously adopted one or two mannerisms of someone who does.Amazingly, some critics have complained about the end, motivated, perhaps, by the vague feeling that no symphony should ever end on a sweet major chord.  Honestly!  Some people wouldn't know a good story if it fell out of the sky and hit them.  The entire film was concerned with the inside of Truman's dome.  We were told, of course, that there was an outside world, as there must be, and we even saw bits of it - but only those bits that were directly connected to the inside of the dome.  When Truman finally, after a GOOD story, dammit, emerges from his egg, the story simply must end: there's no other way to end it.  I hope all those people who wanted to know how Truman will cope with the outside world get their wish.  I hope there's a twee, tiresome, mind-numbingly tedious sequel which tells you everything you want to know.  Serve you right.

Even for now, the story still stands as one of the greatest, especially for me. What's lacking about the movie is that even though it runs at about two ours, it doesn't really elaborate much on Truman's unsuspecting life. The movie immediately sets its conflicts and Truman's suspicions as soon as Truman's character is introduced. Nevertheless the movie can really hold on to its grip over the story and exploits all it can from the angles by using the lens filters and robotics-moved cameras to give the actual spy- cam feel. The acting overall feels also nice. Jim Carrey's acting feels suiting to Truman's character and the changes he goes through.Laura Linney did her part well enough, maintaining that smirk almost all over her screen time.

80,Movie-ManDan,As Amazing & Magical As Can Be.,10,13 April 2015,"The Truman Show is original and provocative movie that has a place in all our hearts. Jim Carrey breaks his typecast funny man role and becomes a more serious character. Of course there are cute and funny moments, but it is just his kindness and casualness that gets the audience cracking up. It is not meant to be funny, just nice to see. So nice, the audience can't help but smile. The storyline itself is original and suspenseful. It is not meant to be a thriller, it just happens to be exciting.This was before the days of reality TV. Nowadays, almost everything is reality TV. Everybody in reality shows know they're being filmed, but what if they did not? What if literally everything somebody did was being broadcasted to the world 24/7? That is just what The Truman Show is about. Jim Carrey plays Truman who has had a camera on him since birth. He lives on the island he grew upon which is completely fake. Ever since he was a kid, they have tried everything they can to keep him on that island, even going so far as having his father drown to discourage him from ever sailing off. Actors play his friends, sand is fake and everything on the island is controlled. It is amazing to see all of this, and freaky how possible it all is too. The filming of Truman's every move may seem boring, but the world loves it all, as the title character is oblivious and goes about his life as an average joe. After all, Truman just works at a bank like thousands of others. Sympathy grows towards Truman, but his life is so full of joy.Truman is in his thirties and has had a camera on him in his fake world all his life. After a while, would there not be malfunctions or mistakes? It all starts when he sees his father being taken away on a bus. There have been subtle clues his whole life, but nothing he really gave a second look at. As Truman really starts checking out anything unusual, excitement grows as we have no idea what will happen to Truman. Will he escape? Will he stay? The ending is something that may be small, but really has an impact.No matter how you classify The Truman Show, it was always be near the top.4/4",The Truman Show

82,Galina_movie_fan,True Man Show:,10,8 February 2007,"The Truman Show (1998) directed by Peter Weir is a story of an ordinary man who does not know that he is a star of a long running show that started on the day he was born and depicts every smallest detail of his life in a picture perfect small town of Seahaven for all world to see. Everything and everybody around him is not real, including his family, his friends, his job, and the whole world that seems so friendly and familiar. The ultimate irony is in his name - he is the only TRUE man among the actors.Jim Carrey's performance is a revelation and it is still a mystery for me why he was overlooked by the Academy of Motion Pictures that year and was not rewarded for his superlative work. He's been helped by Laura Lynney and Ed Harris (great performance). The true star of the movie is Peter Weir's directing - he is the real Creator of this ""theater of absurd"".",The Truman Show
83,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Very engaging even for non Jim Carrey fans,8,11 January 2013,"As many fans know, Jim Carrey is the man when it comes to slapstick comedy. His comical physicality is outrageous and his ability to emulate anything from cartoons to other actors is top notch. But anytime before 1998 I think I can safely say that not many people saw Carrey try and jump out of his shell and try a role that wasn't truly in the comedy genre. I definitely didn't see it coming. And to be honest, I wasn't sure if I would really enjoy it. But in the end, I did, not only because of how well Carrey portrayed his character but with an excellent story to back if up.The plot is about Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) who is viewed live 24 hours a day, uncensored, as a soap opera to the real world through public broadcasting. The thing is, Truman Burbank is the only one who doesn't know this. Everything else around is all a set-up. And when I mean everything,...everything...is a set-up. Even the sun is fake! Nothing is real. All the people Burbank knows are all actors. People who go through the same routine every day.And that's partially what makes this film so great. Every piece of the ""set"" that Truman Burbank lives in is so believable. Along with this is Christof, acted by Ed Harris. Christof is the creator of Truman's world and he essentially plays God. Everything that Truman Burbank is as a person, was created under the supervision of Christof. The whole story itself, written by Andrew Niccol, brings up the controversial issue of nature vs nurture. Who should have control over whose life. Well I think that answer is obvious.Jim Carrey himself actually does have some comedic moments but it's not because he wants the movie to be a comedy. Carrey does what he does because it is the connection to how a human would react to such a situation that makes it funny. And along with those funny moments comes a real emotional performance. Sure Carrey can deliver laughs but also proves that he can portray human drama. That's a question a lot of people wanted to see if Carrey could pull off and he did it well.Adding to the emotion is composer Philip Glass' score. Yes, it did evoke the right emotions and I don't think it needed a theme either for this particular story. Usually I do, but it didn't seem necessary here. Unfortunately for me, I prefer to see Jim Carrey in his comedic skin. I didn't mind the different role that he took on here but it didn't feel like I was watching the movie I wanted to see. And I'll admit, I put too much thought into believing Jim Carrey would've made the film more comedy than drama, so basically I disappointed myself. So on that note, it could be disappointing to fans of Carrey for his comedic films as well.As the first drama film that comic gut buster Jim Carrey stars in, it is not that bad as some would expect it to be. Carrey can deliver a performance like real human but for the hardcore fans, it may upset.",The Truman Show
84,raulfaust,Freakshow,5,16 August 2011,"Well, this film is much different from the most. The story is very original and well thought, but I don't think it was well executed. The director doesn't seem to be capable to provoke any emotions in the spectator until the last 20 minutes, which for a drama film, is a shame. The things happen too randomly and non-sense until around 70 minutes of running, which made me very bored and lost in the story. The soundtrack isn't touching neither deep, so the film isn't comedy, isn't drama, isn't anything! Also, this is a much improbable show, since no decent country would have laws to allow it. Also, tying yourself in the boat isn't very smart, since the boat could turn upside down and you'd drown to death.It is surely filled with philosophical thoughts and questions, but they do not seem to fit in the film. The only things that made me happy are the last minutes, the originality and the cute old lady's couple lol. I think ""The Truman Show"" is one of the famous called ""overrated"" movies. A remake of this with a better director and cast would be reasonable and exciting-- at least for me.",The Truman Show

The plot was excellent, but the execution wasn't all that great nor interesting to catch my attention.I was actually quite bored within the first twenty five minutes until the plot started moving. Yeah, it started getting interesting but still, wasn't interesting enough. It felt way too long, for some reason and slightly boring. I really tried to like this movie. I really wanted to but it didn't work for me.The performance by Jim Carrey was good and sometimes funny, giving us a comedic relief. Laura Linney's performance was weird and Noah Emmerich's decent.

His entire life has taken place within a giant arcological dome in Hollywood, fashioned to create the seaside town of Seahaven, Florida, and equipped with thousands of cameras to monitor all aspects of Truman's life. All of Seahaven's residents are actors. Creator and executive producer Christof wants to capture Truman's real emotion and human behavior.The producers have discouraged Truman from wanting to travel beyond Seahaven by instilling him with aquaphobia through the ""death"" of his TV father in a boating accident, and by constantly broadcasting and printing messages of the dangers of travelling. Despite Christof's control, Truman manages to act in unexpected ways. During his college years, Truman was set to fall in love and marry co-student Meryl, but fell in love with another actress, Sylvia. Sylvia managed to bring Truman out of the sight of cameras long enough to warn him that his reality is fake before she was taken away and off-set, with her ""father"" claiming they are traveling to Fiji. While Truman went on to marry Meryl, he continues to fantasize about Sylvia, using scraps from magazines to recreate her face in secret, and seeks travel to Fiji. Outside of the show, Sylvia has become part of a ""Free Truman"" campaign that demands the end of the show.",The Truman Show

91,DeeNine-2,Can all of life be fake?,8,4 September 1999,"Spooky, profound and perhaps prophetic. Could the world we live in be Truman's world? Instead of Christof (or his predecessor, the Wizard of Oz) could there be aliens Out There running their TV show of us?We can't get out of this solar system. The sun is rigged Out There. Just as Truman could never sail to Fiji, no human can live long enough to transverse interstellar space to Alpha Centuri Proxima, the nearest star. Before the gods we must have demigods in the form of those looking over us, real or imagined. Does it make any difference? And as Christof says, we accept the reality that is given us, so we could be fooled. Anyway, ""The Truman Show"" begins with a startling premise marvelously presented. The script by Andrew Niccol is a work of art and the direction by Peter Weir sure-handed and seamless. He allows the story to unfold at a convincing pace and the fifties cum nineties TV Americana feel to the ""Seahaven"" sets is delightful. Jim Carrey is perfect as Truman Burbank, the poor sap in a fishbowl. Everything about his life, including his wife and best friend are totally fake. Ed Harris as the megalomanic TV artist Christof is creepy enough, although the scenes with him are ironically less convincing than those in Truman's world. I thought he came across a little too much like a mad scientist. Laura Linny as Carrey's TV wife/product spokesperson with the ever present TV smile is wonderful, and good too is his estranged girl friend, Natascha McElhone with the big eyes.Some unanswered questions. We know there is a camera in the bathroom. Do they switch to another shot when he is using it or does the world-wide audience watch him move his bowels? And is his wife a ""whore"" as well as a TV actress or is their relationship purely Platonic? Does the audience see them together in the bedroom? Does she have a life away from him? Weir chose not to address these questions. Although the premise looks a little messy when examined closely, the inspired and completely apropos ending is as crisp and clean as the dot at the end of this sentence.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

92,sme_no_densetsu,Remarkably prescient in retrospect,8,6 September 2014,"These days, it may be hard to believe that Peter Weir's ""The Truman Show"" arrived at a time before 'reality TV' was a household phrase. In the movie, Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, a man oblivious to the fact that his entire life is actually a TV show enjoyed by billions around the world. However, at 30 years old, Truman is beginning to suspect that all is not as it seems, which is a serious problem for the producers of the show.The staggering rise in popularity of reality TV has made it easy to accept the premise of ""The Truman Show"". That viewers would take an interest in the life of a relative nobody is now an indisputable fact. Although Carrey's dramatic chops may not be quite as developed as they would later become he effortlessly supplies the type of personality that characterizes reality TV stars.Apart from Carrey, the highlight of the cast is the always dependable Ed Harris as the mastermind behind ""The Truman Show"". While I find the character to be written almost too enigmatically, Harris nevertheless plays it with utmost gravity & precision. Laura Linney is also excellent as Truman's effervescent wife and there are some notable names in small roles as well, such as Harry Shearer, Paul Giamatti & Philip Baker Hall.Visually, the movie has an interesting look, with plenty of odd angles and lenses to represent the surreptitious filming of Truman's daily activities. The sets & cinematography are usually bright and idyllic, which is all part of the show's controlled 'reality'. Weir's direction landed him his fourth Oscar nomination of six to date. The Golden Globe-winning score by Philip Glass & Burkhard von Dallwitz also deserves mention.Overall, ""The Truman Show"" is an entertaining movie that blends comedy, drama and 'soft' science fiction. That being said, I think that subsequent events have robbed the movie of some of its novelty. It was arguably too prophetic for its own good when it comes to the mechanics of marketing 'reality' as entertainment. It's still interesting and worth watching but the story isn't as fanciful as it once was. Of course, others may have the exact opposite opinion - that the movie's remarkable vision makes it more effective today than ever before. Both opinions are equally valid, I think.",The Truman Show

94,Screen_Blitz,One of the most original comedies Hollywood has to offer,9,27 February 2016,"Have you ever had the suspicious feeling you were being watched or followed by someone? This fear plays a primal in this funny and thought-provoking science-fiction comedy-drama set in an alternate reality, that tackles on the culture of celebrities. Directed by Peter Weir, This film stars Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, a white- collar worker living an average life with this wife Meryl Burbank (played by Laura Linney), but dreams of becoming an explorer and taking his wife on a vacation to Fiji. Soon, Truman begins to encounter some strange events including visions of his father Kirk Burbank (played by Brian Delate) who was lost at sea during a violent storm when he was a child, and suspicious behavior by local residents around him. Truman eventually comes to realize that his world is not what it seems as he is unaware that his life is 24-hour reality television show created by television producer Christof (played by Ed Harris) with an audience of millions of people around the world. Truman sets out on a quest to learn the truth of his life.Not many movies come as original nor inventive as this one. This film sparks an exceptionally intelligent idea and brings it to life with some mesmerizing performances, ingenious writing, and themes that electrify deep imagination. Unlike in his usual comedic work like 'Dumb and Dumber' and 'Ace Ventura', Jim Carrey breaks away from his goofy screwball typecasting and takes on a slightly more dramatic in this thought-provoking drama, while managing to squeeze out some laughs here and there. He is very energetic in his role and gives one of the most refined performances of his career. He's always funny during the right moments and always sincere during the more serious moments; and his character is someone you can't help but love. Laura Linney who plays his wife is also very charming in her role, and her chemistry with Jim Carrey works well. But the biggest gem comes from Ed Harris's portrayal as Christof, the television producer behind the long-running reality show that is the main character's life. He is a very interesting character and diligently written, a character who conveys a God-like resemblance as he is the creator of Truman's life. So yeah, there is a small religious theme in the story and it works very good.Director Peter Weir and writer Andrew Niccol bring quite a vision to this movie. They take quite an innovative idea and do many clever things with it. The movie takes an interesting direction and tackles many thought-filled themes including metaphilosophy, simulated reality, and existentialism. These are best demonstrated as the titular character experiences strange occurrences around him and tries to make sense of them unaware of the shocking revelation about his life. When he suspects the world changing him, he begins the test his boundaries, one scene for example where he tries to drive off a bridge. Then there are some scenes cutting to some recurring characters sitting in front of their television watching as Truman is subconsciously broadcasted via hidden cameras. This idea leads to commentary of the culture of celebrities and media officials' effort on exposing details on the private lives of individuals. The entire concept is of the film is very thought-provoking and powerful enough to leave viewers with a paranoid feeling, but at the same time pokes fun at itself with some laughter and clever characters.The Truman Show is truly a remarkable film sparkled with such an original idea and an incredible script. This is definitely that will appeal to many Jim Carrey fans including adults and maybe pre-teens. Viewers should not go into this movie expecting a straight laugh- out-loud comedy like most of Jim Carrey's films, there are some dramatic and emotional moments from time to time. Overall, this movie is something worth watching.",The Truman Show
95,dunmore_ego,Masterpiece in a Microcosm,9,26 April 2008,"Jim Carrey is overdue being lauded as one of the Great American Actors, especially after his performance in The Truman Show.Written by Andrew Niccol (Gattaca, 1997) in an audacious fit of prescience, Truman Burbank (Carrey) is an unsuspecting pawn in the most ambitious reality show ever conceived - while the world watches, a complete community of actors creates an Anytown America reality for one unsuspecting protagonist - Truman - raised from birth in a massive thunderdome, encompassing the town of Seahaven where even the weather and the sky, the sun and moon are computer programs.We pick up the story when Truman is 30, ambivalently married to Meryl (Laura Linney), downing the occasional brewski with best friend, Marlon (Noah Emmerich) and cruising listlessly through his unrewarding insurance job. One million hidden cameras broadcast his every move.He might have continued the Leave it to Beaver lifestyle till his death were it not for a few unrelated events that created a glitch in his perception of reality, allowing him to discover that his ""reality"" was someone else's ""fiction"" - an intricately complex microcosm of the real world.And therein lies the hook of The Truman Show. Directed by Peter Weir (Gallipoli, 1981, Dead Poet's Society, 1989), this movie poses the ultimate question, ""Is Reality what we perceive it to be?"" Long have we stood solid on the credos, ""Seeing is believing"" and ""Perception is reality"" but this movie proves the fragility of those precepts. We perceive all our ""realities"" through points of reference - we are told this is the sky, the sun, the city, we are told a day is 24 hours long (from an arbitrary measurement which is not entirely accurate); we have agreed on the nature of things (truth, murder, war, dishonesty) and though we think that all we see is ""real,"" and all we feel is untampered emotions, the media, through unreliable sources (television news reports, tabloids, governments) force our perception through a common strainer, molding reality to their ends.This movie is also testament that the inquiring mind cannot be contained no matter the inculcation. Truman WANTS to discover new horizons; to think outside his box. When computer glitches alert him to his being watched, it inspires him to get to the bottom of the mystery.The movie takes us outside the prison, beyond the dome, with creator of ""The Truman Show,"" Christof (Ed Harris in a chilling rendition of a god complex - the name Christof is no accident), giving us flashbacks of Truman's early years, including a chance meeting with a female extra, Lauren (Natascha McElhone). While the script called for Truman to meet and marry Meryl, he fell for Lauren; while Christof's scripters scrambled to excise Lauren from the storyline of Truman's life, his ""true"" emotions would lead him to forever pine for Lauren, going so far as to clandestinely construct a composite picture of her face from magazine models.Look for Paul Giamatti, pre-awards, as the sympathetic Control Room Director and Harry Shearer, perfect as Christof's interviewer. Brian Delate, who must be sick to death of people asking him, ""Are you Charles Grodin?"" plays Truman's father.Back in 1998, it may have been considered unlikely that the major players in Truman's fantasy - his wife and best friend - would give up their own lives and aspirations to be a part of Truman's fiction, but after the advent of execrable stupidities like Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire? (2000) or The Bachelor (2002), it has become somewhat acceptable for monetary gain, infamy and exposure as an ignorant git to replace brains, aspirations and even what people consider their very souls. Hollywood synergy (read as tacit plagiarism) also saw the release of a similar-themed, inferior ""reality"" movie, EDtv in 1999; whereas Truman exposed numerous layers of hypocrisy in our society, EDtv was as thematically deep as a Slip-n-Slide.Eventually, Truman undergoes a reverse Copernican Revolution, where he discovers that the sun, moon and society itself really DID revolve around him - and instead of finding fulfillment, discovers emptiness in being the center of the universe.In the greatest irony of all, Truman tries to escape his Seahaven prison, knowing that after escaping into the REAL world, he would become an unknown; unlike all the drogues in the ""reality"" shows that would come on the heels of this movie, Truman WANTS to be just another face in the crowd, not singled out or made a fuss over - yet it was his drive and uniqueness that enabled him to see beyond his imprisonment and yearn for fulfillment in the first place.At times poignant, at times funny, always an undertone of darkness, The Truman Show is a metaphor for the pioneering spirit which cannot be contained; never more apparent than the final scenes where Truman pounds on the blue-sky wall as Burkhard von Dallwitz's soundtrack swells to tear-welling proportions.The paradoxical and disturbing messages in this movie should be examined for decades to come. Instead, the voyeuristic aspect of The Truman Show has been catapulted to brain-leaching proportions by a society that would more readily watch ""reality"" than live it.",The Truman Show
96,pyrocitor,"Disturbing, compelling, relevant",10,31 July 2005,"I happened along the Truman show when it played on television. Thinking it would simply be another Jim Carrey vehicle (I'm not much of a fan of his outrageously over-the-top style of comedy) I passed it by. When I came across it again, flipping channels, I stopped to watch for a bit. Needless to say, it only took a few minutes until I was completely engrossed in the story, and angry that I had missed the first half of it. Surprisingly enough, while channel surfing later that same night, the same movie was playing yet a second time on the same channel, right after it had finished the first time. What struck me as extraordinary about this chain of events was that it was disturbingly similar to the strange coincidences experienced by the title character of the film. Truman Burbank has lived his life believing himself to be no different than everyone else around him. But after a few strange events happen, and an ever strengthening feeling that the world seems to stop when he isn't around, Truman begins to notice signs that all is not right around him. Unbeknownst to him, Truman Burbank is the most famous man in the world. But sadly enough, it isn't the world he lives in. All his life, Truman has grown up in a completely simulated environment, a gigantic set. Truman has lived for 30 years on television, 24 hours a day. I have to admit - the concept was unique. And the execution was excellent - as we slowly discover Truman's situation, we develop a bad taste in our mouths at the sheer lack of humility it would take for a human being raised for the sole purpose of providing fodder for a television show. We sympathize and pity the innocent Truman, as he makes up feverish solutions for his feeling of being followed, including that his 'dead' father is actually alive, and looking for him. This goes far beyond any cloning moral dilemmas - this is a truly sick concept. Director Peter Weir, who is emerging as one of Hollywood's most talented directors, plays the disgust element regarding Truman's situation strongly. He also provides an interesting portrait of the media and television industries, part satire and part thoughtful reflection. Yet it's hard to believe the 'thoughtful reflection' side when all audiences watching Truman's show seem to be characters straight out of a satire - ditzy restaurant waitresses, a cackling man watching from his bathtub... we can't take these characters seriously enough to reflect on what they represent in our society. Nevertheless, Weir maintains a firm directorial hand throughout; his pacing is superb, and his choices of music are, as usual, unexpected, refreshingly different (droning didgeridoo in the background reminiscent of 'Dead Poet's Society'), and completely succeed in beautifully complementing the film. Weir is no stranger to casting comedic actors in dramatic films, he evoked a similar performance out of Robin Williams in 'Dead Poet's Society'. Here, he manages to morph Jim Carrey from playing the role of Truman as a straight out comedic role into playing a real person, who has the occasional comic moment. Besides being refreshingly subdued, Carrey also turns out a brilliant and consistently watchable performance, which is lucky, since his character in the film parallels his character's role on the TV show. The entire picture revolves around Truman, and Carrey carries (no pun intended) the film with ease. It comes as a let down then, when Carrey lets himself drift ever so slightly over the top at parts, when Truman starts to go hysterical, believing people are following him. In these parts, we start to see Jim Carrey, and not the masterful facade of Truman Burbank he has created.The supporting cast is less developed, also paralleling Truman's TV show, where characters seem to simply float in and out, never really connecting with the lead. The character of Truman's wife, played by Laura Linney, is hastily and sloppily written out of the story, leaving more room for a developing romantic subplot (which, mercifully, is only taken to a certain level) between Truman and a former 'cast member' (Natascha McElhone) whom Truman believes is the only woman he ever loved, and who, in turn, has developed feelings for Truman. But McElhone has one of the flimsiest characterizations in the film, despite how pivotal her character is, only really getting the chance to stare anxiously and complain about how this treatment of Truman is wrong. It's nice to see cameos from Harry Shearer as yet another news anchor, and Paul Giamatti as a show technician, but most of the acting support comes from Ed Harris' masterful performance as Christof, the man who orchestrated and directed virtually every aspect of Truman's artificial life. Harris is spellbinding, overshadowing every actor present except Carrey himself as the character stubbornly refuses to come to terms with the moral issues of his hit TV show.Don't be mistaken into thinking The Truman show is a typical mainstream Jim Carrey comedy vehicle. If you go in expecting this, you are likely to be disappointed. However, if you go in anticipating a thought-provoking masterfully executed film which raises significant moral questions and causes us to strongly re-examine our TV addicted society... you may find that The Truman Show is about as good as you could hope for. If it wasn't for the flimsiness of the supporting characters, the occasional plot hole and Carrey very occasionally drifting into his OTT comedy persona, The Truman Show could easily be the best film of the year. As it is... well, to say the least, it definitely deserves a viewing. And don't be put off by dislike of Jim Carrey - if you didn't like him before, you will now.-9/10",The Truman Show
97,blumdeluxe,Why not serious?,8,9 December 2016,"The Truman Show confronts us with a question more than one of us has probably at one point thought about before: What if everything I take for granted is indeed just fake? What if the world I live in isn't real and I'm just entertainment for someone else? While it does so, it raises some critical points. It's sad to say, but I'm quite sure that there would be plenty of people willing to produce such a show if they had the chance to do so. Furthermore I can also imagine that plenty of parents would be selling their children for glory and cash.While I really liked the female lead in this movie, I slowly begin to worry that I won't become a fan of Jim Carey in this life anymore. Not that he played bad it's just always a bit over the top, the smile a bit too bright and the behavior a bit too enthusiastic to really take the otherwise very earnest plot serious. I did cheer for him to escape, not at least to reunite with his true love, but the end may be a bit uncreative. In an otherwise perfect illusion the best they can do is the most obvious staircase I've seen in a while? And a painted wall? But never mind, what is so special about this film is that it is not too far away from what could happen. Especially nowadays, with the technology increasingly modernizing, it would probably be not too hard to make a baby grow up in a perfect illusion.

I enjoyed the movie more the first time than the second, I'm not sure it holds up very well to scrutiny.

The result is a most entertaining hour and fifty min. With disturbing implications about privacy and reality vs fantasy that the viewer is free to pick up on or reject. I chose the later option and recommend you do the same. Give it a B plus.

102,baumer,Look closer and this film may be about you,9,29 September 1999,"First off I have to say that I really believe that the majority of people that didn't like this were people that were expecting Ace Ventura to pop up on screen.  Like all of a sudden Jim Carrey's face was going to explode with laughter and he was going to break into fits of absurdity the way he did when he talked with his butt.  And if that is the hang up you have with this film, then I pity you because there is so much to this film that it could make you look at things a little closer.The Truman Show is what seems to be the story of a man that has lived a make believe life.  We all know what it is about and if you don't then this review is not the best one for you, skip down in the IMDb and there are many great reviews about what Turman is in the narrative sense.  I want to touch on something else and it is something that I hope other people can see as well.The Truman Show can be a metaphor for anyone's life, especially us that dwell in wealth of the Western Culture.  Because the one question arises in this movie that doesn't let go of you is a scary one, and that is "" What is real? ""  I'm not talking in the literal sense the way Truman has it.  His life is not real in the sense that he is there for everyone to view and take pleasure from.  But when I ask "" What is real? "" I mean what in our life is real?  I'm sure that you can get a myriad of responces to that question but after seeing this movie it makes me question every single one of the answers that I can come up with.  The Truman Show asks you to open your eyes and look around you.  Is what you see pleasing?  Do you have the white picket fence, the two car garage, the double income family, the kids that are going to make you proud and go to college, good friends, a few pets, an okay boss, a sense of security, a faithful spouse, a nice car, money in the retirement fund and so on.  Well do you?  If you do, is it possible to fathom that it could all be a sherade, that it is all a mirage?  That white picket fence could get destroyed by a tornado or vandals, your two car garage could get destroyed by a fire, your double income family could be reduced to nothing if one of you is caught cheating or there are budget cutbacks and someone loses a job or becomes expendable, the kids may not want to go to college, they may get pregnant or make someone pregnant and want to work in a hardware store for the rest of their life, your friends may not like you very much and just put on an act for propriety sake, in fact one of those friends may be sleeping with your wife or husband, your pet may get run over by a car, your boss may despise you, the stockmarket could crash and all of your sense of security with it, your nice car is just a machine to get you places and the retirement fund could be gone tomorrow, you never know.  The whole point to this is that The Truman Show wants us to look a little closer at what it is that is important to us.  It shows and tells us in a round about way that we have become strange and demented when we prioritize the things in our life the way we do.  And in a way, every character in the Truman Show could be us.  How many of us want control the way Ed Harris has control?  How many of us are the loving wife ( or husband ) who is happy on the outside and stark raving mad and downright miserbable on the inside? How many of us want to tell the world that something is wrong with it the way Truman's one and only true love wanted to tell him?  How many of us are the consumate actor when we need to be just like Truman's best friend?  And how many of us are Truman, a guy that knows something is wrong with his/her life but has no idea what or how to fix it?  I think we are all like these people sometimes.  And that is what makes The Truman Show as brilliant as it is, because it is twisted but so is life.  If you haven't seen this film I strongly recommend that you do, and if possible watch it back to back with American Beauty.  Both have a lot to say about society in general, they go about it in different ways but it is essentially the same message. 
"" It's never to late to start over. ""This is a great film and one that should be seen to be appreciated.  It is a gem and deep down it wants us to look  closer.  Sorry to steal that catch phrase from American Beauty, but it applies here just as well.  Life is what you make of it, it just takes a little work.",The Truman Show
103,mstomaso,Cinemetaphysical!,9,12 September 2007,"You may not like it, but you have to respect it.Brilliant, thoughtful director Peter Weir (The Last Wave AKA Black Rain, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Master and Commander, Gallipoli, Dead Poets Society, Fearless and many others) teams up with excellent screenwriter Andrew Niccol and a great cast to give us a science fiction film with a range of emotions exceedingly rare for big budget mainstream cinema. In addition to the really disturbing questions the film raises about the nature of reality, metaphysics, religion, entertainment, human cruelty, voyeurism, and the concept of freedom, the film also offers a glimpse of humanity simultaneously occupying its worst and best aspects.The cast is phenomenally good. Carrey gives Truman the life his rich and sympathetic character he deserves - providing some of the most disturbing comedy I have ever witnessed. Tasha McElhone, Ed Harris, Peter Krause and Laura Linney are all excellent - though you may end up hating most of them for various reasons as the film progresses.Truman's entire life, from his birth onward has been one long TV show. He is literally being broadcast 24/7/365 and he knows nothing of it. His mom, wife, best friend, and everybody around him are all cast members. And the show is shot in a giant set which simulates an island. Because of a traumatic experience with the sea during his childhood, Truman does not feel free to travel away from his island home.Yet Truman is oddly compelled to explore the world and has begun to suspect that something is very wrong. Meanwhile, in what we like to think of as the REAL WORLD, everybody is watching him. People stay home from work to participate vicariously in his life in hopes that they will somehow catch a clue to ""how it will end."" This film is pretty heavy. You might find it amusing the first time you watch it, but once you've allowed it to exhaust you a few times, all that is left is the superb craft and the intense and disturbing ideas it constantly bombards you with. The film has a dark side and a hopeful, light (but never airy) side which - amazingly - is exposed concurrently with the heavy stuff.The cinematography is as picture-perfect as most of the work Weir is associated with. The acting is remarkably good all around, with those mentioned above in the outstanding roles. Sound is usually a very important component of Weir's films, but it's a little underexploited in the Truman Show - perhaps to (sometimes with painful force) draw the audience's attention to the profoundly insane dialog.The Truman Show is plot heavy, heavy, a little funny, and profoundly smart. Do not see it under the influence of anything detrimental to your mind or emotional balance......FLEX YOUR HEAD.",The Truman Show

The concept was amazing at the time and still is relevant, storytelling, directing and acting are absolutely on point.

105,brchthethird,A heartfelt dramatic satire that remains one of Jim Carrey's best,10,14 November 2014,"This was an incredible, heartbreaking, yet uplifting story of a man who discovers that his entire existence is manufactured. Jim Carrey gives a powerful performance as the titular character, whose wide-eyed optimism and sense of humor make it nearly impossible not to root for him. We, as the viewers, are treated to three different perspectives: Truman's World, Christof's World and the rest of the world who have been watching Truman's life unfold since the day he was born. Beyond the creepy, suburbanesque world that Christof created for him is the real world where billions of people watch him day in and day out. One thing that movie does extremely well (although I don't think it was the first) is how eerily prescient it is in predicting the nature of reality TV and its effect on our culture. It also explores themes such as the nature of reality. It's just an incredible film all around, and should be seen by everyone.",The Truman Show
106,sharky_55,"Yeah, let's see what else is on...",9,6 August 2015,"One might wonder how you would view The Truman Show without the knowledge of the twist premise of Truman's life. It would be impossible to market, but it would be an interesting study in deconstructing all the oddities in Weir's direction and Biziou's cinematography. Their work in creating the world of Seahaven is done with excruciating care and detail much like the work of god-figure and showrunner Christof. Thousands of extras and covert cameras, a gigantic dome complete with artificial moon and sun, 400 life sized buildings, props and costumes of all kinds...But Biziou also injects a sense of hyper realism into the film. The use of high key lighting, the scenes slightly over-lit create a subtle and controlled sense of artificiality. It's combined with the voyeuristic photography; sneaky povs from behind car dashes and vending machines and cupboards, vignetted frames suggesting surveillance, the way the edits will bounce from normal compositions to handhelds from the likes of Meryl's necklace or the neighbour's trash-cam. The almost too pristine and perfect production design of Seahaven's architecture and sets provides a lived in and yet unnatural world that Truman resides in.Laura Linney is the consummate professional, Hannah Gill, who in turn beats out 5 other actresses to land the star role of Meryl, Truman's college sweetheart and eventual wife. There's plenty of love and sincerity punctuated briefly by moments of consciousness and recognition. Linney portrays these moments with such genuineness. A nervous glance at the hidden camera at the back of the car as Truman goes for maniacal joyride, or the nuance of the startled expression and scoff that she quickly struggles to hide when Truman confronts her: ""You can't stand me...That's not true!"" But she quickly re- establishes the veneer and takes the opportunity to parade another product for the millions of viewers. On several occasions, her sweetness is turned up to 11 and the camera quickly and eagerly zooms her satisfaction (and a clear view of the product name). Ed Harris' Christof doesn't seek to hide the nature of his feelings; the first extended sequence has him pulling all the strings from a sleek and moody studio in the sky, heavily contrasting the cheerful Seahaven. He expertly guides the broadcast for maximum emotional attachment, but is himself distant. In the final scenes, we are treated to an almost tearful monologue, a last plea from the father figure to his son, beckoning him to turn back into his loving arms. Harris plays this part out with such a tender sincerity that it's easy to forget his showrunner persona (the character of Marlon was once given cancer amidst contract disputes). In the bathroom or the shower there are no cameras, and the sex scenes are only hinted at, but ironically Christof has no real regard for his son's privacy. There's still complexity and depth; after several lighting strikes and a violent storm, Christof witnesses Truman's heroics (""There's our hero shot"") and relents. The Truman Show could be described as satirical, but also prophetic in a way. After all, the international hit Big Brother only debuted the following year, but even that never hit the heights of Truman's audience. It's clearly exaggerated in size and scope, but the real question is, by how much? Roger Ebert makes a telling point; even a decade ago you would not see the likes of celebrity culture focused so intensely on subjects like Snooki or Honey Boo Boo. These days we have that in materialistic excess, entranced by the manufactured stories and plots and the high turnover rate, obsessed by every detail of their lives. If 20 million can watch the Neighbours wedding episode and millions more watch the royal wedding of 2011, how many would tune in to a real life Truman special wedding episode, especially with someone as accomplished as Christof to elicit the maximum emotional connection? I really like the role of Natascha McElhone as Sylvia, as a college extra who falls in love with Truman. It would have been easy to limit her character as just a unrequited love, but she eventually transforms into a protester of sorts, frequently calling in and pushing her agenda: Free Truman. It's such a pinpoint reflection of reality; it would be exactly the sort of protest group that would form if a Truman Show replica existed in our world, with the ever raging controversial debates on free will and the ethical and moral implications of such a show. The scary thing is that apart from Sylvia the world is sparse of this sort of concern; the parallel edits of the various fans of the show in different locations cheer and look on with hope and horror as Truman attempts his sea escape, and they burst into applause when he speaks his famous catchphrase and exits Seahaven...and then they switch channels and look for another source of entertainment. They are, like many reality show fans, hugely invested in Truman as a character, but oblivious to his nature as a real human being. I wonder how the film would play out with a more serious actor; whether Weir would forgo some comedic elements and add more drama, but then you lose the charm and appeal of Carrey in scenes like the beach pizza shop and the mirror astronaut play-acting. But even then, it doesn't matter. The illusion is never shattered; the audience only care for the final catchphrase. Linney and the fake making-of documentary reveal a little insight on the character of Gill; as a child actress who finally hits stardom and is very concerned with the nature of her contract. She's managed to negotiate a sizeable payment every time Meryl and Truman have sex. It's very easy to focus on that rather than the heartbreaking revelation that Truman is faced with at the end of the film.",The Truman Show

Everything is perfect, too perfect. He wants more. A wife that he loves and beautiful Fiji. But can he escape? Furthermore, will he ever find out that his world is a creation of Hollywood?The Truman Show is a magical movie. It's one of the very best that the 90's had to offer. At the same time, it's still underrated as a classic movie. Is it because Jim Carrey is the star? Because without him, I feel as though this film would have been more warmly accepted. But I defy you to think of a better actor to portray Truman than Carrey. In his first non-comic role, he captures tremendous vulnerability and childlike optimism. This role isn't a footnote in his career, it was the next level entirely. Peter Weir presents the film through the lens (literally) of hidden cameras. Every minute of this film, it seems that someone is watching him at different angles. As a visual touch, that brings it all home for me. This is no average movie.",The Truman Show

This Peter Weir comedy drama was the first role Carrey was able to give a more serious and dramatic role which earned him his first Golden Globe, showing the viewing public he could perform at a serious level, rather than constant slapstick. His sentimental portrayal of a man who wants a bit more out of life is excellent, dramatic and also a sign of hope for the watching audience of the Truman show, which was vital. Though I love Carrey's humour in previous films, I personally felt it was necessary to see a different side to him, and he pulls it off so well.The character Truman is a real joy to watch, a symbol of hope and joy for the viewing public. Having a lot to deal with, such as a stressful job and a complicated life with the loss of a loved one puts viewers at ease as it embodies what other people go through, to watch someone else go through it with a positive energy justifies the viewing audience. Having a goal also is inspiring and a great human characteristic.The plot is consistent with an excellent setting and idea behind it. We see typical objects and ideas associated with the reality TV genre, such as acting, props and of course the main setting for the show, which is the whole world Truman lives in, a real landmark for the reality genre and is executed brilliantly with a real sophisticated approach to it, where everyone is in certain place at certain times, which all revolve around the central protagonist, which makes the film slightly humorous to.Great support is given from Oscar nominated Ed Harris who plays the creator of the show.

All his friends and loved ones are actors and he's the only person that isn't in on it. As reality tv becomes more and more outlandish you can't help wondering whether this will happen in the not too distant future.
Ed Harris is superb in the supporting role of the producer/director/creator of the show. Paradoxically he guards his privacy and is a very private person and has a number of memorable lines. Carey is also superb in the lead role and the ending must be one of the more uplifting moments of 90's cinema. 9/10.",The Truman Show
115,itamarscomix,"Oh, and in case I don't see ya",10,30 March 2006,"With its (all intentional of course) cheerfully colorful cinematography, cheesy music and one-dimensional supporting characters, it's easy to miss just how brilliant The Truman Show is; it's in fact one of the most important cinematic creations of the 1990's, at least as important as darker films like American History X and Fight Club, and one that works on several different levels. Because while it works quite clearly as a sarcastic satire and a commentary on the destructive and intrusive nature of the media in the post-modern age, in the light of the reality TV syndrome which was at the time just starting to grow, it's also a philosophical metaphor about the state of mankind.For Truman's story is man's story; and it's difficult not to see the importance in the names given to the lead characters. True Man's life, the film says, is an illusion, a lie. Or perhaps  all our lives are illusions, but the True Man is the one who figures it out and seeks a deeper truth. In its essence the point is very similar to the one The Matrix made; The Truman Show is a fascinating trip through Plato's Cave, and while it takes a rather simplistic look at Plato's philosophy  because any other way would be impossible in a film of less than two hours  it doesn't dumb it down. The Truman Show is a deep and intricate film that deserves repeated viewing and gets better with time, and can be discussed for hours.Writer Andrew Niccol  who made his breakthrough debut one year before with the critically acclaimed cult favorite Gattaca  lost the Oscar that year to the Academy's favorite Shakespeare In Love, and director Peter Weir got most of the credit for the film; but while it's certainly an important achievement for Weir and the best film of his long career, it's Niccol's sarcastic, intelligent, innovative script that made The Truman Show great; that, and the amazing performance by Jim Carrey, who showed his fantastic dramatic skills here for the first time. Carrey is enchanting in the lead role as the ultimate everyman Truman, and we're as fascinated with him as the show's fans in the film. Praise should also go to Ed Harris, who plays Christof, creator and director of The Truman Show (and again, special attention should be given to the character's name)  and also to Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Natasha McElhone, Harry Shearer, Peter Krause, Paul Giamatti and the rest of the wonderful supporting cast, both in Truman's world of Seahavan and in Christof's 'real' world. Finally, a word of praise for the excellent musical score, composed by Burkhard von Dallwitz and the great Philip Glass, which compliments the film's atmosphere to perfection.The Truman Show is not an easy movie to absorb; it's a disturbing tale and a disturbing message, which takes some time to seep in, and while it's entirely unconvincing as a reality and even as sci-fi, and feels more like a metaphor than a story of a specific man, it's also entirely involving and demands to be taken at face value. Truman's character is irresistibly charming, and just like the people watching The Truman Show, we believe in him and identify with him completely. The beauty of The Truman Show is that it's lots of fun; it proves that entertainment and art are not necessarily opposing ideals. By being entirely entertaining and gripping, it gets its messages across a whole lot better.The Truman Show is now eight years old: the way I see it, once a decade has passed, a film can begins to be considered a classic. The Truman Show will pass that test. In any possible aspect, The Truman Show is one of the absolute best films of the 90's, and one that will remain relevant long after reality TV has bitten the dust.",The Truman Show
116,mitsubishizero,Great Commentary,10,10 September 2020,"This was an interesting film that best showcased Jim Carrey's acting talents. He even came up with some of the jokes such as the mirror one later on in the film. Truman(Jim Carrey) slowly begins to realize he lives in a show set for other's amusement. After questioning his life, he begins to escape to see the real world. Much to the dismay of the creator(Ed Harris).In a way, this film has some good commentary. Do we enjoy the shows we watch despite the misery the actors have to endure to entertain us and will we still like them even after the truth's revealed? Even after he leaves, where's he gonna go and what's his life gonna be from then on?While most viewers probably won't think about that, when you watch it a few times it does raise a few questions the more you think about it. It goes without saying but Jim Carey's the highlight of this movie. His acting's over the top but also dramatic when he needs to show confusion or wariness.The antagonist himself isn't really evil. Amoral yes but in a twisted way, he does want what's best for Truman despite making him a virtual prisoner. Some of the gags are hilarious like the hospital scene where he's trying to get through only for a nurse to stop him with some equipment. It would be funny if Carey took it and rolled it away.The ending's pretty thought provoking as well. After he leaves, the bar patrons celebrate while also wondering what they'll watch next. That's an interesting way to end it. This was a great movie to watch. It's funny, thought provoking and clever at times in how it gets its point across. With that being said, watch for yourself.",The Truman Show

For good and for bad, it is very different and a unique movie experience.In general, ""The Truman Show"" is okay but far from perfection. Some moments are a bit boring. It was directed by Peter Weir, the same guy who directed ""Dead Poets Society"".""The Truman Show"" is a movie which makes us question this: «What if my whole life was nothing more than just a reality-show? What if my whole life was just a television program? What if the whole world knew everything about me and my life?».That's exactly what happens with the character Truman Burbank. He doesn't know about this, but as the movie runs he suspects that something's wrong and slowly he finds out the truth. He also finds out that even his wife, his best friend Marlon and most people he knows are actually hired actors. However, Sylvia (Truman's dream woman) is the only one who supports him and feels ashamed about what they are doing to Truman.Jim Carrey does a great job as Truman Burbank. However, Jim Carrey is hilarious as usual in this movie but at the same time he does a very good job as a dramatic actor. Yes, this was his first dramatic role ever, which was a challenge for Jim Carrey, but ended up as a victory.Ed Harris is great as well in the role of the arrogant program's creator Christof. But the other actors do a good job either.This movie is distinguish for being so different and fresh, but at the same time it has the power of letting me paranoid. It's notorious how after this movie came out lots of reality-shows were made (naturally inspired by this movie's idea).This movie looks simple in many ways, but it also has some amazing and original things: a perfect sunset, a nice and lovely town (Seahaven), beautiful sceneries, stunning views of Seahaven surrounded by the sea, the moon which is Christof's studio, different and good camera angles which give us the impression that Truman is being watched (including from the inside of the electronic climate controls of Truman's car - somebody explain me how did they do that?), the rain falling on Truman, the incredible storm caused by Christof's selfish orders and even that final part - when Truman walks through the sea and Christof talks to him from the sky. That final part is so well made that we can consider it magical.By the way, I can't finish my review without talking about the soundtrack.

Besides, there's plenty of more instrumental songs (not classical, however), which are equally awesome and very relaxing to hear.",The Truman Show
119,johnstonjames,"One Of The Best, Most Beautiful And Moving Films Of The 1980's",10,26 July 2010,"i don't know why i compare the two, but i think this movie is even better than Terry Gilliam's amazing film classic 'Brazil'. it's just feels deeper and more moving. it's not that the whole Amnesty Int. thing in 'Brazil' wasn't moving, i just like Peter Weir's film better.Peter Weir is an unusual and intelligent film maker. his films never cater to mass taste and his early films are basically foreign ""indie"" films. early Peter Weir films like 'Pinic at Hanging Rock' and 'The Last Wave', are brilliant and intellectually provocative works of intense cinema.this has got to be Peter Weir's broadest film. it plays to a broad audience and caters to mass taste. even though Weir worked with Harrison Ford on two movies, 'Witness' and 'Mosquito Coast', those movies had less of a broad audience appeal.'Truman' also has a timely quality that even seems more relevant today than ever with the influx of reality shows inundating the current media. and with all the ""big brother"" conspiracy theories out there today, 'The Truman Show' reads kind of like a comedy conceived by George Orwell.and what can you say about Jim Carey? excellent. i can't believe he wasn't at least nominated for an Oscar for this. he makes Truman Burbank a cute, likable, even kind of schmaltzy, character without losing the depth and serious side to the performance.a brilliant and wonderful film. it also should be noted that even though it's aimed at adults, nothing here is offensive and is suitable viewing for the whole family.",The Truman Show
120,kenandraf,Average,7,13 February 2001,"This movie was ambitious and attempts to be a classic, yet a weak screenplay prevened it from being so.It turned out to be a deluxe episode from the Twilight Zone instead.Carrey did a very good job showcasing more of his versatility adding to people's respect for his talents.You will get your time and money's worth from this movie though.It is worth a look if you are looking for one of those light comedy/drama movies that still makes you think.A must for Carrey fans who are growing in number fast.He is one of the best comedians all time and this movie confirms it.He proves he is not all slapstick and rubber face only but is capable of other styles of comedic techniques......",The Truman Show
121,Ben_Cheshire,As perfectly choreographed as the world it depicts.,8,25 June 2004,"The major factor in this is one of the best screenplays i've ever seen. Its a thing of beauty the way it progresses, shifting gracefully through different levels of reality: first we begin inside the show (with opening credits like ""Truman Burbank as Himself, Created by Christoph""), along with interviews with cast members to establish the concept that Truman Burbank is naive to the fact that his entire environment is contrived by a television producer in the ultimate reality television experiment, everything from the weather to the dialogue of the actors who play the people close to Truman. This terrific concept never loses its impact: each time you see it, it takes you on the journey again. Even considering the spate of actual reality TV that has invaded our homes since 1998, which this movie foretold (or perhaps inspired), this movie will always retain its appeal because its specific situation, raising a baby in a reality-TV environment and keeping them from knowing they are on TV and that they are fake (in other words, what reality TV strives for, giving viewers genuine reality to watch, in the person of Truman), is not likely to happen in real life.Each moment is so beautifully rendered in cinematic language that film buffs the world over should feel like applauding it at every turn during a second viewing in particular. Take the scene where Truman goes to the travel agent to book his trip to Fiji: we see Truman standing in the agency, with bags in hand and beach-holiday clothes, and the most precious musak plays in the background. When he sits, we see a poster on the wall behind him with a plane being struck by lightening and big letters ""THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU!"" So simply, it conveys to us that they are going to try and stop Truman travelling by plane as well.And the much-praised performance from Carrey really holds the movie together. He's got the tone just right for this movie: which might be perfectly described as ""wry."" It has a fable-like quality, each moment infused with humour, yet we never lose sight of the eerie reality that this is a human being trapped in this situation.The full credit for achieving this delicate balance of tone goes to Peter Weir (Australian director of Dead Poets Society, Gallipoli, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Witness, Mosquito Coast and Master and Commander).The Truman Show is without a doubt one of the best movies of the 90's. A rare perfect film. 5 stars.Best bit: the two most famous scenes, the stopping traffic scene and the incredible final scene.",The Truman Show

125,jdkraus,This is one of those inventively original films that pushes creativity to whole new level,10,14 July 2013,"There are many entertaining films. Fewer are great ones. Even fewer are ones that are memorable and push the limit in terms of inventive creativity and pure originality. ""The Truman Show"" is such a tour de force. It is a film that is hard to describe. It is not quite a comedy though it is funny. Neither is it a drama though there are dramatic elements to it. ""The Truman Show"" can be a genre of its own: fantasy, science-fiction, comedy, drama, adventure, thriller--all fit into this movie. It is that unique. As a feeble attempt to explain the plot, this movie is about a man who lives a seemingly ordinary, middle-class life in suburbia, who happens to be filmed from every angle imaginable. The catch, he does not know about it. As bizarre factors begin to take place, he starts to question his identity and life around him. Like the millions of viewers who turn in to see Mr. Truman, we too are fascinated as to what he does next and ""how it will end."" Jim Carrey as Truman turns in perhaps his greatest performance (although Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was pretty good too). His trademark humor is left out and he becomes this individual trapped in a world that is beyond his control. The supporting cast is very solid, particularly Ed Harris as Christoph, the man behind the curtain so to speak. However, it is Carrey who steals the show, I mean, it is about him after all. Besides the acting, Peter Weir's direction is sublime, the visual effects are impressive, the editing is well-paced, and the score is simply astounding. If I had to make one criticism about the movie, that is its abrupt ending. That aside, I consider ""The Truman Show"" to be one of the most creative films ever made and one of my favorites. Way better than ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Shakespeare in Love.""",The Truman Show
126,tomimt,Reality TV,9,27 December 2009,"Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) lives on a small town of Seahaven, is married to a pretty nurse Meryl (Laura Linney) and has a job as an insurance sales man. He's afraid of water because an accident that drowned his father and he is generally very well liked among the people of his little community. Yet he dreams of going away.One day a series of curious incidents lead him to believe there's something strange about his environment, like if the whole world is revolving around him. And funnily enough it is: Truman is, with out his own knowledge, a start of a reality show, that had begun the very day he was born. Among unwanted babies he was chosen to be a star of the Truman Show, a live broadcast viewed by millions of people all around the world, dreaming of more simple world they live in.The Truman Show is a well woven satire about the extremities of reality television. Despite it feels like a show revolving around a single clueless individual would be far fetched, it doesn't feel like that at all, when you compare it to a stream of ""reality"" nonsense in the TV today. While the movie itself comes a tale of a man, who is trying to travel to the edge of his own reality, the other aspects of the movie good deal of criticism and very justified questions about the whole nature of reality TV graze.All in all the cast is solid and does a very good job. Ed Harris is especially good as Christof, megalomaniac director/creator of the show, who is trying his hardest to keep Truman in his place. Jim Carrewy gives one of his best performances, showing he can do serious work, if given good enough script to work with. While the music is used sparingly, the soundtrack contains some very memorable tunes.The Truman Show is one of those movies I usually watch from beginning to the end, if I happen to catch it from the TV. It is very well made movie and I would even consider it a classic on its own right.",The Truman Show
127,Isaac5855,A Biting Social Commentary On the Effect of the Media on Today's Society,9,5 December 2005,"THE TRUMAN SHOW was an intelligent and stylish social commentary about lost hopes and dreams, as well as the effect the media has on us. Writer Andrew Nicol and director Peter Weir take us into the extraordinary world of Truman Burbank, a sheltered young man with an alleged perfect life whose life, as it is slowly revealed to the viewer, is a 24-7 television show, directed by a God-like dictator (Ed Harris)who has televised and controlled Truman'life from birth and is determined to hold onto Truman even after he has caught onto what is happening. The thing I love about this story is the way it unfolds slowly...the story is told at a leisurely pace and we are only thrown subtle clues at first. There's a wonderful moment where Truman is walking down the street and is almost brained on the head by a spotlight. The expression on Truman's face at seeing a spotlight fall from the sky is just priceless and we are scratching our heads the same way Truman is. Once Truman realizes what is going on, he wants nothing to do with it and attempts to escape. Whether or not Truman escapes is unimportant, what is important is watching Truman trying to figure out what is going on. Jim Carrey redefined his career completely with this completely captivating performance in the title role. Carrey proved that he knew how to do more than pratfalls and mugging with this thoughtful and riveting performance and it was outrageous that Carrey was not nominated for an Academy Award. I don't know about winning but he at least deserved a nomination. Ed Harris, as Cristof, the director of Truman's show, gives the performance of his career that should have won him the Oscar. He was nominated but was robbed. A wonderful film that is worth seeing if for no other reason than to marvel at the amazing performances of Carrey and Harris.",The Truman Show

129,emm,"Carrey's ""breakthrough"" movie unearths too many possibilities.",6,22 January 1999,"First off, this is Jim Carrey's best performance I've ever seen, although he still doesn't act very dramatic like some have believed. He has a jolly, cheerful character inside of him, and is toned down from his past films, which is acceptable. Consider him a world famous television icon, if you will, because THE TRUMAN SHOW is how simple, everyday life compares simultaneously with a never-ending broadcast. In other words, ""All Truman, All The Time! 24 Hours A Day, 7 Days A Week!"". (L.O.L.) Many will miss Carrey's goofball personality, which confirms a local newspaper out here giving this one of the worst five movies of 1998. Well, go figure! You have many options of how to describe the movie. Is it based on real life accounts or is it an imaginative fantasy about the world media? Does it mean to be heartwarming or just made to be the highest-rated television program in the world? Will it be funny, or will it make you shed some tears? It's obvious that the first half tends to be tedious, only for the second to be more meaningful as we finally understand our pal Truman being under surveillance by a special broadcast control center past the heavens. This bares a similarity with God in control of everything around him on the earth. It appears like Truman is the inspiration for every one of us who tune in. Overall, I discovered the second half being the best feature, but while it had the best entertaining value, it goes by way too fast along with its final ending, making me beg for more. THE TRUMAN SHOW isn't a bad idea on Peter Weir's part, but it might not be appealing enough to attract our strong desires for solid enjoyment. I fare this film better than the newspaper gave it, but as a whole, I say ""above average"".",The Truman Show

Think about all of the children who were born after the ascendance of the internet. Many of their lives are not unlike Truman´s life: every moment captured for all the world for all of time.What is even more disconcerting is that many people willingly choose to focus on and cultivate their internet presence at the expense of everything else.

A man discovers, at the age of 30, that his life has been entirely a manipulated television show, and the world around him a stage set and the people around him actors. The scenario necessarily requires quite a lot of suspension of disbelief, and is meant to convey a message. Director Christof does not merely want to keep his show alive; Truman was an unwanted baby, and Christof deliberately wants to keep Truman in his cocoon world to prevent him seeing the world outside and how bad it is, and does everything he could to discourage Truman from wanting to leave.Basically, the story is predictable. Once Truman knows the world around him is manipulated, why would he bother to stay? If he can leave the cocoon, why wouldn't he, if he is a normal, healthy man? Really, with everything spoiled, the whole point of the show is lost, and there is no way things could have ended otherwise, so the story's end is actually anticlimactic.",The Truman Show

The only thing is, Truman thinks he's an ordinary guy and he doesn't know anything about this. Until one day, he finds out the truth about his so-called life.
I really wanted to like The Truman Show but I just didn't.

The movie is a surreal fantasy and it sets itself up from the very beginning. Those of you who have read my comments on IMDB before know that my favorite thing in a film is atmosphere. This film has a great atmosphere from the very beginning and never lets up. I had heard many different things about Jim Carrey's performance. All I can say is that this is the best performance of his career so far and shows that he is much more than just a great slapstick actor. Peter Weir has done an excellent job with this film and Andrew Niccol's screenplay is amazing. Don't go into this film looking for Ace Ventura or Dumb and Dumber, you'll only be let down.

137,WriterDave,Ambitious and Entertaining Treatise on the Reality Media Creates for Us,8,20 March 2003,"It's not often a Hollywood film arrives with such lofty ambitions as this. On one hand this is a high concept comedy in the vein of ""Groundhog Day"" about an unwitting man whose entire life has been a TV show.  This is also a Jim Carrey vehicle designed to display his charms.  On the other hand this a very satirical look at the way the media manipulates our reality.  The film also wants to take a philosophical look at free will vs. a higher power and reality vs. fantasy.  It doesn't always work as the satire often keeps you from thinking too deeply about the underlying themes and the philosophical stuff keeps the satire from biting as well as it could.  Credit engaging performances and solid and thoughtful direction from Weir for keeping things afloat and entertaining.  There are some great cinematic moments here.  I loved the ""stolen kiss on the beach at night"" and ""Cue the sun!""In the end this film is closer in spirit to psychological dramas and sci-fi movies where a person suddenly realizes they are the pawn in some grand experiment or a prisoner in an alien world than it is to anything in our current ""reality TV"" obsessed culture.  Eventually it touches on a very basic conflict all humans must face (most people do so in childhood, some I fear never do).  The universe does not revolve around us.  In the closing moments we are excited for Truman because he finally realizes there is a whole new world out there to explore, but also slightly saddened because we know all to well that he will never be able to return to that idyllic ""childhood"" existence.

Jim Carrey is one of the best actors of this generation and I hope he continues to make excellent films like this one.  Usually, I'm not one to like films with a ""deeper meaning"", but I really like this film, because it gives you so much to think about and makes for an interesting story.  At first I thought this film was absolutely improbable, but after watching for my 3rd or 4th time, I don't think it's all that absurd (extremely unlikely, but not completely impossible).Director Peter Weir did a fantastic job with this film and this is probably one of his best films.  The cast was excellent throughout the film.  Ed Harris was just as great as always.  Laura Linney was superb as Meryl. Also, I think Natascha McElhone and Noah Emmerich deserve some special notice for their work.  The rest of the supporting cast was good as well, Paul Giamatti, Harry Shearer, Philip Baker Hall and everyone else.If you like Jim Carrey, then you really ought to see this film.

The biggest reality show in history. He is filmed around the clock and has been for all of his life. The only thing is, he doesn't know it. But now things are happening that makes him question his reality. How will this affect him? ""The Truman Show"" is a very entertaining film. Besides the interesting concept presented it is also well written, well acted and masterfully directed. What also makes it entertaining is the way that you feel sympathetic towards the characters, the way that many of them are believable in their artificial way. Jim Carrey does some of his best work here as Truman, far removed from the antics of the Pet Detective.In the end what raises this movie above the crowd is the interesting concept. A concept that should give plenty of food for thought for people with tendencies towards paranoia. It also asks important questions about the importance of freedom vs. security.

I'm an action movie buff, and I get bored readily by dramas, but this one is interesting in a way reminiscent of the old TV series, ""The Prisoner"", but not as pointless. And while there's a fair chunk of arty, the film was accessible to me, not one of the elite.Who would like this film:   -- drama fans, even if you hate Jim Carrey films normally   -- types like me who can appreciate a drama if it's intelligent, not too slow, and not too arty.

The idea of having a man grow up in a 50's sitcom-style universe without him knowing it and then show it as a TV-show 24 hours a day is a somewhat perverted idea but everybody in this movie seems to eat it up. It is not that I am against movies with questionable morals but it seems the situation the main character, Truman is in gives everybody some kind of unexplainable Ecstasy. They are almost slobbering at the screen and all they are really seeing is a person who does pretty much what we all do every day.It might seem like an odd way to start this commentary but I can't for the life of me think of a better way. This is no ordinary movie and the premise is somewhat unusual but still I don't know why it is supposed to be so brilliant. A man is followed around by cameras all day and night and doesn't know it. All well and good. But why does the he have to live in a totally artificial universe where everybody he knows is a fake? And why does Christof believe that he is God because he controls the destiny of one man? When Truman begins to suspect that something is wrong, Christof will destroy everything he has created to keep Truman in the universe which no longer exists because Truman has become aware of it.To say that this is a entertaining film would be stretching the truth. If it is an educational film it doesn't teach me anything. Am I supposed to think TV is bad? Please. Why use a movie then to teach the lesson. Am I supposed to think people are drones who follow every direction which is shoved down their throats? Then why sohw it in a movie which is supposed to sell tickets bought by the same people.

The metaphor is very, very potent in this one. So much goes into criticizing our current publicity/promotion oriented society, governed and determined by money, where man is turned into either a slave (Carrey) or a machine. This film is a big, big eye-opener on what free-will has become in our societies, free-will which we supposedly have more of now than ever before in our history. This film is quite subtle, pays attention to detail well enough, and delivers an incredible metaphor that seems too great for anyone to miss out on. Just one of these main, essential ideas that should've been made before but wasn't, and now this is it right here, and you have to watch it.

145,ronakkotian,Completely blew me away!,10,29 August 2019,"The Truman Show, an absolute classic, was a movie that blew me away. This film is genius on so many levels.The film follows Truman Burbank, a man living in the perfect world of Seahaven, who is unaware of the fact that his entire world is a large set and he is the star of a grand TV show, known as The Truman Show, created by Christof.If you've only heard the synopsis now and never watched the movie then you must be wondering ""How will this movie work?"". I had the same thought before watching it. After viewing it I can say that The Truman Show is exceptionally made and one of the greatest films ever to come out.What makes this movie undeniably amazing is the direction, screenplay and acting. Peter Weir's direction is simply outstanding. There isn't any moment where you feel bored since the film paces extremely well. The cinematography and shot selection is perfect. Both add to the realism and make the idea of this world being a TV show very believable.The acting all around is fantastic. Jim Carrey plays Truman effortlessly. Aside from the script, Carrey makes the character of Truman believable and lovable with great emotion and personality. Ed Harris was also brillant as the manipulative creator of the show. Everyone else's performances felt real as they pretend to be in the same fictional world as Truman.The most praise I have to give this movie to is Andrew Niccol for giving us this unique and thought provoking script. He has wrote a script that will get people to think because The Truman Show is much more than what it looks like on a surface level. As you dig deeper into the many underlying themes of the movie, that's when you realise how profound it really is. The film's plot is very interpretive. Many viewers will come up with different theories trying to piece together the actual meaning of the movie. There are ideas relating to the way media manipulate people, God, reality shows, desires and much more.The Truman Show is an example of how great cinema can become. Weir and Niccol have done an exceptional job and I applaud their efforts.

146,garethcrook,Was nothing real?,8,31 July 2019,"Jim Carrey is an odd one isn't he. Much loved for his slapstick stylings, I've never really warmed to that side of him. The Truman Show is different. Yes there's Carrey's silly side, but here it makes perfect sense in his fictional world with every detail dialled up to eleventy-stupid. It's the sinister underbelly that's that lights the touch-paper though, it's ridiculously troubling, taking a baby, putting him on camera, cutting him off from the real world and fabricating a picket fence utopia without his consent or knowledge. It's the knowledge factor that's key for Truman, not his lack of, but his thirst for. This is Ed Harris' world, his character Cristof's idea of utopia and as Truman grows up, he outgrows the godlike creators vision. Sure there's love too, a longing for someone, but Truman is an explorer, it's in his soul and can't be contained or controlled. It's a film full of spirit, as well as chuckles and twilight zone drama, but it's the rooting for the underdog urge that makes me love this so much. Maybe we see ourself here somehow, don't we all sometimes imagine ourselves as the star in our own show and what is real in our consumer world anyway. ""We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented"", but we all know what's real and what's fake... well just about. This is a fun film, a simple premise, yet feeling utterly original and as over the top and grand as the world it displays. It's cinematic to the core, even boasting a Philip Glass score and is probably my favourite Carrey film (although Eternal Sunshine is great). A joyous ride to the end, with genuine heart in mouth moments. ""Was nothing real?""... well who knows!",The Truman Show

While I'm sure it wasn't intended, this movie is the perfect spoof of all reality shows, and demonstrates just how ridiculous they really are.Truman is a man who was ""enlisted"" at birth to be the sole focus of a new wave in television, a 24/7 reality show that runs continuously over his lifetime. The whole world watches his progress throughout this ""scripted"" life, where Truman's every move becomes a fanatical obsession with viewers.Truman becomes suspicious of the ploy, and begins to be disillusioned, seeking ways to exit this created world that has boundaries...As a different movie it shines, but as an epic it falls short...it does, however, make you wonder about our link to television, and how it has taken over our lives...",The Truman Show

151,baileycrawly,"Unique, Ambitious, Well Executed",9,15 March 2020,"Jim Carrey shines once again in this film, proving (as if he has to at this point) what a strong actor he truly is.
The Truman Show follows a young man (named Truman) who isn't aware that his entire life is a reality show. The movie focuses on his gradual awareness and attempts to break free of the control that unseen forces have over his every move.
It's an extremely unique idea, and it makes for a very ambitious film. It's the kind of idea that needs to be carefully executed because it's an easy one to fail to correctly portray, but the team behind The Truman Show did a fantastic job. At no point in this movie does it feel like it's dragging. At no point was I compelled to check the time on my phone.
It was weird, it was zany, it was unlike anything I've ever seen before. I loved every second of it. It really leaves you with a number of important things to think about and contemplate. Well worth the time.",The Truman Show

This got overlooked after SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, which I also thought was terrific, but this is terrific too.  In addition to Jim Carrey(who I normally don't like) and Ed Harris (who I do like), who were both great, I also think Laura Linney deserves praise as the actress playing Truman's wife.

An excellent idea, with excellent scenario (I guess both go to Peter Weir) and an excellent performance by the protagonist, Truman. Once again the Academy ridiculed themselves by not giving the Oscar to Jim Carrey. It is one of those movies I call a cinematic experience. The perennial story of the fight for freedom, told in a truly original way. If you think you are left unsatisfied with the end, you are potential viewers of the fictional Truman Show. But the most annoying scene for me was the very last, where the two cops take the remote and change the channel to find something else... At their faces I recognized everyone of us.

Filling out a well rounded cast is Ed Harris and Laura Linney.  It was a shame that the Academy didn't even nominate Jim for his uncharacteristic performance, but he was nominated for a golden globe though, losing to that Kevin Spacey guy.

155,chrisbrown6453,"It all starts with a light, falling from the heavens.",9,19 June 2002,"From that point on, Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) realizes that something is different in his life. He's got a beautiful wife, good friends, a good job, and seems very happy. But something is wrong, and he can't put a finger on it. Until one day, he sees his thought-to-be-dead father, and things start falling into place. His life is one, big TV show. From birth, Truman was adopted by a company for the express purpose of televising his life. From the day he was born to the day he would die, Truman Burbank is a TV star, even if he doesn't know it.This movie is all about Jim Carrey. The big talk was how he signed for $13 million (a pay cut from his normal $20 million salary) so he could do a more serious film. Could he pull it off? And I'm here to tell you, not only did he pull it off, it's an award winning performance! Anytime the audience feels so strongly for a character on screen, the actor has done his job, and in this movie, I felt like I was a part of Truman. He's a sweet, loveably guy, who was put into a situation without permission. Nothing in his life is real, from his marriage to his friends, to the guy selling him his newspaper every day. And Carrey makes you feel sad for him, but he gives Truman a heroic quality that makes you cheer for him to break free from the ties that bind. The story itself was unlike one I had ever seen before. One man (Ed Harris) controlled an entire city. From the sun rise, to crossing the street, everything was timed perfectly. And billions of people each day sat and watched the life of Truman Burbank. I read that Jim Carrey felt The Truman Show was like his own life, in that everything he does is seen by millions of people, and sometimes, you just need to be left alone. I'm glad he chose to do this movie, because maybe now people will understand him a little better.  It was just a shame that he didn't win the Academy award for Best Actor, I mean he didn't even get nominated.  What a shame.  Thank you Mr. Carrey, because of this film, you have shown the world that you are not just a rubber-face comedian.",The Truman Show
156,acedj,Carrey's first serious role,8,22 November 2019,"This is the first movie I saw where Jim Carrey plays it pretty straight laced and goes more dramatic. This movie is about the ultimate Big Brother television show. Truman Burbank is adopted by a network and his life is on full display 24 hours a day, seven days a week, all without his knowledge. He lives in a giant dome that recreates an island town. To prevent him wanting to leave, as a small child they instill a deep, fierce fear of the water. Every resident of the town is an actor, some of them having been there for the majority of their lives. Every interaction of his life is scripted as best they can, until one day Truman gets an inclination that not is all as it seems. While Truman struggles to find the truth, the world watches on.
While I have enjoyed watching this movie many a time, it does have one flaw, to me.Laura Linney, an actor that I have in all her other roles, seems miscast to me in the part of Truman's forced happy wife. Laura typically plays such a strong female lead that perhaps it was just her having to play an actress cowed into catering to Truman, a person she clearly dislikes, was what I did not like about her here. Were it not for this small flaw I would have given this 10 stars. This is a great look at mass consumption of media and the ultimate greed that is at the core of the human species.",The Truman Show
157,DavidSim240183,In the world according to Truman,10,1 July 2005,"Have you ever stopped and actually looked at your everyday life? Where it's going? Where it's coming from? The people you share it with? The events that have shaped your life right up until this point in time? That's the dilemma Truman Burbank is facing.Truman (Jim Carrey) lives in the idyllic town of Seahaven. The sky is always blue. The people are always friendly. He has a loving wife and mother. It's as if everybody knows everybody. Life couldn't be better. But something is missing from Truman's life in a way he can't explain.Although Truman's life is seemingly perfect, he doesn't get much fulfilment out of it. There's a desire burning in Truman to explore. To see the world. To get out of Seahaven. But most importantly, to find a woman called Sylvia. A woman he grew to love. A woman who filled the void in his life. A woman he has never forgotten.If Truman's life sounds perfect to you, that's because it's been engineered that way. Unknown to him, his entire life is a TV series. A series called The Truman Show.Truman is the star of his own personal reality show. Cameras follow his every move. The town of Seahaven is an elaborate set, and the townspeople are actors. Including Truman's wife and mother! The events of his life are all under the watchful gaze of Christof (Ed Harris), the show's creator and overall overseer. He decides Truman's destiny, his every decision, possibility and train of thought. He controls Truman's dreams and ambitions, broadcasting his life to an audience of millions.The Truman Show is a truly extraordinary film. One of the most daring, thought-provoking and intriguing films to come out of Hollywood in God knows how long. The attention to detail in this film is just amazing, but it's the little things that keep bringing me back, such as the ominous advertising posters dotted around designed to put Truman off travelling.The film has been created in such an intricate way it constantly improves with repeated viewing. The way we follow Truman's exploits are incredible, how the influence of the creators are always around, like the way Truman has been deliberately traumatised to keep him away from the ocean, and thereby discovering the truth.Jim Carrey is the emotional core of the film, and he rises to the challenge admirably. For the most part, he reins himself in, becoming increasingly disturbed as he slowly senses the truth. Little errors and discrepancies such as a stage light seemingly falling out of the sky, stage hands caught putting together sound stages and the conversations of the creators filtering through his car radio start to alert Truman to the truth.The small details of Truman's artificial world really enhance the viewing experience. I like the adverts on TV subliminally suggesting he should stay home instead of thinking of travelling, as well as the creators trying to make good when they've slipped up in their routine. The subtle attempts at brainwashing are everywhere, and send the chilling message of how much power the media has over our lives.Ed Harris also puts in an excellent performance as the megalomaniacal Christof, a man with a Messiah complex. He's been watching every aspect of Truman's life, from the day he was born, and will continue to script his existence till the day he dies. Which may be a day of Christof's own choosing. Another chilling possibility. The possible what if's and maybe's are intriguing, because there is so much potential to this type of situation.One of the most touching aspects to Truman's life is the connection he formed with Sylvia. She was a sympathetic co-star, and tried to reveal the truth to him. But a relationship with her went against Christof's master plan, and you can see the way he's scripted encounters that would lead Truman to marrying another woman, Meryl.So Christof had Sylvia kicked off the show, but she touched Truman's heart, and he spent so many years searching for her. Unsuccessfully, of course. One of the best scenes is during a talk show with Christof about the making of the show. We learn so much about Truman's artificial world, and how much power Christof has over his life. The idea of a corporation buying a child from birth is not only sickening, but also a chilling foreshadowing of what the media will do for ratings. Sylvia has every right to be appalled by this, and the arguments between her and Christof are both compelling and intriguing.As things come to a head, and Truman begins to rebel against his existence in Seahaven, I found myself rooted to the spot. There are seldom films these days that can have that effect on me. Truman on the sea trying to escape, Christof using every means at his disposal to stop him, the people glued to their TV screens. I was practically cheering Truman on.I'll never forget that part at the end, when Truman finally gets out. The look on Christof's face is priceless. He looks a broken man. For the first time in his life, he's lost his power over Truman.But the ending is truly exhilarating, and is the emotional icing on the cake. The only complaint I have with Peter Weir's film is I wish it were a little longer. I would have liked to have seen more of the relationship between Truman and his on-screen wife, and how they cope with their sexual relationship and their jobs.But The Truman Show is still a magnificent film. A wonderful, insightful journey of one man's dreams being observed by the everyday world. As Christof puts it:""We accept the reality of the world we're presented"".Next time you look in a mirror, make sure you really look. You may not be the only one staring back.",The Truman Show
158,domino1003,Truman's Adventures in TV Land,9,1 August 2005,"When we first meet Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey), he just seems like and ordinary, chipper guy, living an ordinary life. Married to the beautiful Meryl (Laura Linney)he seems to be just fine.But as he leaves for work, a piece of lighting equipment falls from a clear blue sky. You soon realize that Truman's life is far from fine.And that is the premise of ""The Truman Show,"" directed by Peter Weir. Truman wants to leave his town of Seahaven and see the world, but he slowly realizes that the town doesn't want him to leave. And with good reason. He is the star of an incredibly popular worldwide show, only he doesn't know this.His whole life, from womb to man, has been televised. Created by Christof (Ed Harris), the town people (Including his wife and parents)are actors, each one of them manipulating Truman's emotions and responses. Christof even creates a way to keep Truman from leaving: His ""father"" died in a boating accident, causing young Truman to be afraid of water.But as much as Christof can try to control Truman, he fails. Truman becomes rebellious, trying desperately to escape his existence. More importantly, he is in love with a girl named Lauren(Natascha McElhone), who he met in school, but was taken away (She tried to tell Truman the truth).In one of the film's most dramatic scenes, Truman has escaped the town by sailboat, conquering his fear of the water. Christof, playing God to the end, calls upon the elements to stop him (sun, storms,lightning), trying to crush the very thing that he created. When Truman reaches the end of the line (In the form of a sky blue wall), Christof speaks to him from the sky as like the voice of God, trying to coax him to remain.In a world in which every network has at least 1 reality television show, ""The Truman Show"" is not as effective as when it was first released. However, you may say that the film may have brought home the point that we as viewers are fascinated with watching someone else's life unfold in front of our eyes.Carrey's performance is incredible, clearly showing he has dramatic range. It's too bad that he can't do this more often, but audiences prefer him to make them laugh instead.For the longest, I had a huge beef with the way it ended, in which Truman walks through the door and out of the show forever. I had wished they could have shown us what would happen after he left. However, I finally understood why they did not. Truman had been trapped by fear (the fear of water, for example). When Christof talks to Truman, trying to convince him to stay, he tells Truman that the world he is about to enter is different from the world he is leaving: the real world is full of lies, deceit and horrors. Truman's world is a place where none of those fears exist. When Truman steps through the door, going into the real world, you realize that Truman has truly conquered his fears after all. He steps into this brave new world, unafraid of what will happen to him. Still, it would have been nice for us to see him reunite with Lauren/Sylvia. But deep down, you know that they will. Great film to watch.",The Truman Show
159,moviemanMA,Tru(man)ly remarkable!,10,3 July 2005,"Have you ever thought you were being watched? Like you life was possibly a Television show? Well, Truman Burbank never did and this movie tells of how he found out his life was a TV show.Quite possibly one of the most imaginative plots ever, Peter Weir's The Truman Show shows how one man's vision (Ed Harris) of having someone's life be on TV (that being Truman played by Jim Carey)...without him knowing it. A totally real show that has no boundaries except the walls of the enormous set. With actors playing the roles of the townspeople in this perfect community, as it seems.Jim Carey is brilliant as the confused insurance salesman who just wants the truth about his life. The death of his ""father"" drowning at sea has given Truman a reason to stay in his town and not venture off. But the urge to see the woman of his dreams is all to much. She was moved to ""Fiji"" because of some problems. Laura Linney plays Truman's wife. She isn't only his wife but is a walking commercial. Whenever there is a product she brings home, it seems like she is telling the world how great it is. Noah Emmerich plays Truman's best friend Marlon. This always uplifting character brings comic relief for Truman when he needs it most. When Truman's world seems to be falling apart, he's there. When Truman just needs a friend, he's there. Marlon is the one part of his life that makes it seem so real when everything else seems so fake.What makes this movie so enjoyable other than the story is how the people act in this ""town"". The way they make sure Truman stays there and doesn't leave. How everybody has a routine and even the weather is controlled. In the opening scene Truman wakes up and heads off to work to have a stage light fall right in the street. Where it came from?...he doesn't know. But doesn't worry about it because life is going great...for now. Ed Harris's character Cristof a.k.a. the Creator is genius and maniacal. With his people working around the clock to make sure all is well, this world he has created is now a world wide phenomenon. He is on top of the world with millions of people watching his creation unfold.This sensational film about a man trying to find his way in the world is incredible. When everything seems like it doesn't add up, it just keeps getting more complicated and giving the viewer one hell of a good movie. The Truman Show is in a league of it's own.",The Truman Show

It rode the wave of its inception as well as initial popularity and at the same time as it was making fun of it. Each character, but the main one, is a caricature of reality TV and its entourage, even its dissidents. It feels as fake as its subject, yet it brings important points.

161,lagudafuad,this makes big brother look like child s play,8,7 September 2012,"I sometimes wonder how my life will be if it were a TV show, I see this movie and i quit the wonder.The Truman Show was written by Andrew Niccol who got the inspiration from an episode of The Twilight Zone called ""Special Service"".After the script had gone through some re-writes, Jim Carrey was picked for the role, although the makers had to wait for him to have a clear schedule before he could start shooting.Made with a budget of over $ 60 million dollars, The Truman Show was a financial success and also was nominated for three categories in the Academy Awards, but did not win any awards.The movie tells the tale of an Insurance salesman Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) who lived his entire life, since before birth, in front of cameras for The Truman Show.Unaware of this fact, Truman's life is filmed through thousands of hidden cameras, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and broadcast live around the world, allowing executive producer Christof (Ed Harris) to capture Truman's real emotion and human behavior when put in certain situations that are concocted by the writers.The thrill about Truman's life is that everything is arranged for him, down to the woman he married to his best friend.The movie cinematography is such a way that you get to see mistakes from the show makers and how they arrange things in the back end to make Truman do some particular things.The script and the movie lines are fun, especially when the Actors had to advertise on the show. The could be a conversation going on then one of the actors will just drift to talk about an object in such a manner you wonder if they have lost it, only for you to figure out seconds later that it was an advert in the show, that was very creative.Before making this masterpiece, Jim Carrey had just finish Cable Guy (1996) and Liar Liar (1997).The movie is directed by Peter Weir (Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003)), who did a great job pulling the viewers along as they watch a movie of a show.

162,willcundallreview,A great idea for a great film,8,15 April 2014,"Rating-8/10The Truman Show that is as light as it is thought provoking, with a fake smile and a world built around him Truman is a true film hero and although maybe he doesn't do much, we still feel oh so much for this character. With the right mix of comedy and drama to go down with it too, The Truman Show shows us what a show is all about and in a true sense shows us how obsessed the ordinary person is with certain peoples lives. I felt the film was safely a great movie, and here below is why I felt that about it all.The story is superbly smartly done and whoever even thought if this idea is just awesome, it brings us all the elements we want to see from a film like this too and certain moments when Truman is finally seeing what the world is all about are just fantastic. The film isn't scared to be fun either as the story although is serious, the things we see in it sometimes aren't and we can get a few laughs out of this but as I said before, it incorporates the right amount of drama into it's plot too. One minor thing is that the for it's running time of 103 minutes it manages to fit such a complex plot into such a short amount of time, just brilliant in my opinion.Jim Carrey portrays Truman in the way we always expect from Carrey, loud and very crazy, although this isn't like all his roles as Carrey has to deal with the drama too and manages not to always be trying to be funny, a good job from him. Ed Harris as the TV network head is kind of a strange mix of evil and goodness, where as he wants the show to continue, you can also tell it slightly eats him up that Truman is shown to people like this. The entire cast do an excellent job and even the odd policeman or shoe owner seems to do there performance with a hop and a smile, just good fun had by all.Peter Weir does a fun job and really makes this his prime artistic vision that is brought to life perfectly, this is probably his best piece of work in my opinion. Andrew Niccol the writer also chips in with his artistic vision in writing to create dialogue that just keeps are eyes on the screen to see what this insane thing is all about. I loved the sets used and not to ruin some cool things which you will see for yourself but some things are positioned in some pretty neat places too.Although the film is great, it isn't without maybe minor things which stop it from being superb, Like for example I didn't find this that funny and although it fun and bouncy when trying to be funny, you won't be crying with laughter at this. I also felt the ending was poor and although it makes for an interesting end and one you definitely wouldn't expect, we don't get to explore much of it and just ends right there right then. It isn't perfect but it is has very little problems so if you ignore them things, this could be one of the best films you will ever see.For those who love Jim Carrey well this is probably one of if not his best work in film and although as I said he holds back on humour slightly, he still manages a fantastic performance as Truman which mixes a lot of elements together. I think if you ever wanted a thought provoking film then this is it, I don't think it make you think philosophically, but it makes you think about human nature and lying etc, what the world really thinks of other people and how we talk about each other.Overall will give it a 8/10, Safely a Great movie, I couldn't recommend this much more to you and especially to those who consider themselves as film connoisseurs as I feel this could be essential viewing. Have fun with this movie and it will reward you, come in thinking of it as super serious and you will be disappointed, I can assure you that watching this can give you a little smile and although sometimes you might feel like shouting ""GET OUT OF THERE TRUMAN"", you still just feel happy for him the entire way through.",The Truman Show

He was always a very versatile actor. But I consider this one one of his best one, still today.""The Truman Show"" was made in a period in which television was deeply changing, where reality shows were exploding as a genre. I have always considered this production as a critique of this kind of empty and useless form of entertainment, that unfortunately became so popular and still today is very important for so many networks, as a lot of people watch them. Truman is a prisoner of this kind of entertainment (as a lot of people are), the only difference is that he did not have any choice, while common people can always to turn off the TV. The concept is very original and in my opinion way ahead of many productions at the time.Actors are phenomenal and you can actually see how much fake characters around Truman are, while the main character seems to be the only genuine one, that wants to escape from that golden prison, just to explore the world and reuniting with the true love of his life.

You want him to figure out the truth of what he is really doing and what he is really a part of. The concept of having someone live their whole life in a TV show and not know it really isn't as far-fetched as it seems. Truman has a few psychological problems, but with cameras everywhere the network would know if someone was trying to get him to realize the truth.

It is indeed a well-balanced and technically flawless film. It came out at the right time and gained instant critical acclaim thanks to its prophetic and thought-provoking idea. While the premise is indeed inspiring for its time, the plot development is so out of focus, and writing could have been way sharper. It falls flat and even fails at making a point in the end.

Broadcast 24 hours a day from hundreds of hidden cameras in the largest television studio in the world and using a cast and crew of thousands. This is the ultimate satire of life in a media fishbowl. While he has been provided with an almost perfect existence, Truman is not entirely happy and he has begun to suspect that something is going on around him and that things may not be what they seem.This is also the story of the audience and their dependence on this real life soap opera that has been broadcast everyday for over 10,000 straight days, and finally it is a story about the media as personified by Christof (Ed Harris) who has become the ultimate manipulator of life.At the heart of the picture we have a well told story from screenwriter Andrew Nichol who would be nominated for an Oscar and directed by Peter Weir also Oscar nominated and one of his 6 Oscar nominations (four of which were for Direction. Both plot and character are given considerable attention here so we follow incidents but also the affects these developments have upon the characters.The title role is well played by Carrey who gives his most restrained performance up to that time, Laura Linney gives another strong supporting performance and Ed Harris seems perfectly cast as the creator and master manipulator of this all encompassing media event, and for which he would be Oscar nominated.",The Truman Show

You'd be forgiven for thinking someone is watching what you're doing, especially with the abundance of CCTV nowadays.That's what inevitably happens in the life of Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey). Unfortunately he's not gazed upon for reasons of security, as he is unaware his life is actually a 24/7 hour show for the rest of the world. From womb to tomb, his actions have kept millions enthralled, but a few broken set pieces and a lost love may finally pull the blanket over Truman's eyes.This is probably Jim Carrey at his most mature so far. He's a performer who has such a wonderful bounce in his step, that makes him devilishly cartoony in everything he's ever done both comedic and serious. Ed Harris is fantastic as the show runner, and for as serious as the film gets emotionally. I don't think it ever underwhelms or overwhelms either.Regardless, you sympathise with Truman because his life has been manipulated so well. But maybe that was another subtle point the movie was making, that someone's misery is abused for ratings despite differences from right and wrong? Saying that, I don't really think I'd ever question my existence to the extent of Truman's, and I really admire this quotation from director Peter Wier: ""This was a dangerous film to make because it couldn't happen. How ironic."" Final Verdict: An American classic, and a unique film that begs multiple viewings. 9/10.",The Truman Show
179,flingebunt,Definitely Different but broadly entertaining,7,22 February 2005,"There is one fantastic reason to see this movie, it has broad audience appeal yet at the same it is very different from other movies and no one has ever recreated it....yet. Truman, played by Jim Carrey (Great acting, but not really Oscar quality material) lives blissfully aware that he life is just a television program. But his journey is to discover the truth about his life and attempt to escape the illusion.Australia director Peter Weir has often delved into the theme of isolation, in the Australian outback with ""picnic at hanging rock"" (I went there but I was disappointed not to disappear), on the Ocean in ""Dead Calm"", in the mind with a post traumatic syndrome suffering plane crash survivor ""Fearless"" and in an exotic community ""Witness"" (The Amish in the big city and Cop in the Amish community both experience this). Often disappointing for people who love Peter Weir, the Truman show appears on the surface too light and fluffy, but we find the same themes being repeated here. Does this movie reflect the relationship between God and humanity, children and parents or government and society...yes to all the above. However I feel the main theme is the relationship between the American people and the unreality of American TV.Truman is trapped in a giant studio with an artificial sun and weather. He can't escape because people try and stop him and his own fears. Fears that reflect how television and movies (which appear on TV) make viewers feel about the rest of the world. Most criticisms of this movie fail to see the truth behind the illusions. The overly constructed world that Truman lives in reflects the reality of TV but makes it harder for us to identify with Truman and his personal despair. This movie requires you to watch it with your brain turned and you must attempt to deconstruct this world. Something that is not common in a mass market appeal movie.Sometimes criticised for not being dark enough (just because the lighting is bright and shiny and Truman is a happy and wacky guy these people say it is not dark....they need a good slapping). Sometimes criticised for being too superficial (that is the point, that is what TV is like). Sometimes criticised for not keeping many of the incidental characters around long enough (Truman exists in a world where he is the only ""real"" person so it is a solo journey and only the shows producer, who represents the world and not a person, are part of).Sometimes criticised for not showing Truman's interaction with the real world (I agree but that is a different movie and something done better many times over ""Being there"" for example).What does it all mean, my own take is this. Television is not trying to keep us down, but challenging us to take on the adventure of life. Television doesn't want us to avoid reality but to go turn off the television and find the best and most exciting reality we can. If you are not brave, clever or good enough for the world, don't blame television.I would challenge those who didn't like it the first time to revisit it. For those who haven't seen it, watch it dude, there is nothing else like so you are either going to like it or not.Oh...and one advice for Mr Weir...people who like art-house movies are not really that intelligent. Next time use lots of spooky dark art noi lighting and they will like it too (that was irony by the way).",The Truman Show
180,patches89,WAS NOTHING REAL?,9,11 January 2021,Jim Carrey has built a career has one of Hollywoods funniest guys but he has been involved in some brilliant straight up movies and this is the best of them. He plays Truman Burbank who lives his life the way he wants and thinks everything that occurs in it was real. As the film went on he becomes aware that hes part of a popular tv show documenting his life. Ed Harris was brilliant also as Christof the showrunner and creator of the corporation who adopted Truman. The film was created with so much love and you can truly see that based on the quality of the film. Brilliant,The Truman Show
181,Silverzero,One of the most original ideas to come out of Hollywood in a long time.,9,7 February 2003,"The Truman Show is a fresh and thought provoking comedy, with some excellent acting, directing and scripting. It's a very simple concept and is a bit slow to start off but after the first fifteen minutes it reaches a climax and continues on that note for the rest of the movie. The acting is great all across the board, (Jim Carrey's best film to date). The films humour flows naturally and the drama is very gripping. Indeed The Truman Show is one of those few films that doesn't rely on special effects and a huge budget to be a great film. 8.1 out of 10.",The Truman Show
182,ExpendableMan,Cue the Sun,8,25 August 2005,"Back in 1998, the concept of Jim Carrey appearing in a more serious movie than his usual fare was unthinkable. Surely, the man who gurned his way through Ace Ventura couldn't handle a thoughtful, well-written drama without the shadow of those tropical shirts, ridiculous catchphrases and ludicrous facial expressions looming all over it? Well, while the studio may not have thought so either (consider the marketing campaign which focused mainly on the comedy), the results speak for themselves and established the man as more than just a one-dimensional funny man.Carrey is Truman Burbank, a man with a seemingly great life who just can't shake the feeling something is wrong. His world seems so neat and organised, too perfect to possibly be real and when a camera mysteriously falls from the sky for no immediate reason, it kicks off a chain of events that lead to him questioning the authenticity of his very existence. For unbeknown to him, he is the star attraction of The Truman Show, a program all about his life within a sealed idealistic, Eisenhower era world of apple pie and sunshine and everyone around him is an actor. Every second of his life has been watched by millions.With a concept such as this, it is no surprise that the movie raises a lot of troubling issues. The philosophical nature for instance is not unlike that of The Matrix, in that it is difficult to sit through it without wondering if there are limits to the very world around us. Furthermore, the moral issue of reality TV rears its ugly head, asking us what price we pay when we glamorise the ordinary and make everyday people our entertainment? Sure, Truman has had a good life and is totally safe from harm, but how much of that life did he choose for himself? Carrey of course is a magnetic focal point. He was clearly keen to stretch his very capable acting muscles by this stage in his career, but that isn't to say his comic side has been totally abandoned. Just watch his attempted road trip to New Orleans for example, the man barking and ranting maniacally as he careens almost out of control through town in his car with his hysterical wife on the passenger seat trying to reel him in. It is a very funny moment in the film, but his actions here are brought about not by the inherent zaniness in his personality, but more by the growing frustration at his inability to get out of the town.However, the scene where he really comes into his own comes in the moments following his encounter with his supposedly dead father. Driving to work one morning, his radio malfunctions and after beating the thing with his fists like we've all done at some point, he suddenly picks up radio transmissions detailing his every move. He parks his car and wanders the street, trying to draw attention to himself but failing, even stopping a bus in the middle of the road to no reaction, the occupants simply waiting for him to get out the way. What if he really were the exact centre of the universe and everything else just revolved around him? That isn't to say this is a one man show however. Laura Linney as his wife Meryl is also well cast, her wholesome nature at first being very sweet, then growing ever more troubling as Carrey's paranoia escalates. Then of course there's Ed Harris as the eye in the sky directing his every move. At first, he is a benign guiding influence crafting a Utopian vision for his progeny. But then the child begins to resist the father and events spiral out of control, soon Harris has become a fascist dictator denying Truman the choices he so desperately needs to make himself.As a whole then, The Truman Show is a rewarding experience. It contains one of Carrey's finest dramatic turns to date and while we can revel in the philosophical and moral issues at work here, it can also be enjoyed simply as a very charming and uplifting movie. Come the climax, I doubt there'll be a dry eye in the house.",The Truman Show

It took a while, combined with growing up, combined with a more cynical attitide to the media, to actually get the movie, and appreciated it more with every time I watched it.The story isn't that complicated, but the execution is brilliant. It's not just Carrey and Ed Harris who carry this movie. If you watch past Carrey's great acting skills, you'll notice it's every co-star and extra who purposely overact their way through this creepy but palpable fake world, created to suck Carrey and the viewer in it.We are already in the Truman Show, we all know it, and we accept it.",The Truman Show

The world of Truman Burbank certainly took me back to those days. I used to look at myself in the mirror and say out loud: ""I wonder if I am me? I wonder if everybody thinks the same shade of red when I say red? Why was I born? Why are my parents my parents? Why did God create the world? Will I get punished by God for thinking all these things?"" This is a deep movie, bound to become an art film.  Jim Carey did such a superb job that it earned him a Golden Globe Award. This is definitely an Oscar contender. It made me think! What a suprise! Movies do not make me think very often. They are predictable to me now. Could it be age?When the lady comes on the bike with the basket, then the dog and then the yellow Volkswagen it reminded me of how repetitive life seems at times, when we think that nothing is going to change and we want changes. The Director was like God,  the creator,  although at times he was a mean guy, I think that all of us have questioned God and have been angry at him. Truman's world seemed so ""perfect"", no messy hair, no trash. Just phony! Our world seems much like that, everything is a matter of perception.The audience that watched the Truman Show in the movie was a hedonistic audience of consumers who wanted to be entertained no matter what the cost to Truman, reminded me of the soaps, of the Paparazzi, of how we like to know about the celebrities, and ultimatly of how the product could be the death of someone such as Princess Diana, or Truman Burbank.Purchase the video and watch it many times and many other symbols will come to mind.

1. When Truman walked out the door and the production team shut down the show, two security guards said, ""Let's see what else is on.""2. The scariest part, I think, lies in the fact that the actors around Truman are performing all day long. What about their lives? Aren't they controlled by the director every day? After all, they are the most pathetic Truman.3. If the film stops abruptly at the moment when the ship touches the wall, and there is no door or outside world, that kind of deep despair can elevate the film to a higher level and completely turn it into a tragedy.

The thoughtful premise, expanded under Peter Weir's competent direction and the boundaries of human imagination, its simply delightful to watch.Jim Carrey's performance is much acclaimed, and deservingly so. He's charming, but he despairs, panics and explodes when the only world he knows begins to collapse around him. He invites empathy and sympathy when the people closest to him turn out to be completely robotic in their approach. In supporting turns, Ed Harris steals every scene as the paternal puppeteering show runner Cristof, a man with nerves of steel and an almost single-minded focus on his passion project. Imagine a diabolical version of Richard Linklater. I also think Laura Linney's performance was hugely underrated - cheerful but out of her depth, hysterical and yet the perfect wife of a TV character.The screenplay is simply perfect. At times its a thoughtful observation of Christianity, with divine intervention by Cristof, and others its a meaningful reflection on reality television, with everyone rooting for and against his trials. What it does best though, is capture every realistic aspect of such a setting - actors don't know how to respond to spontaneous behaviour, actors force product placement on camera, outsiders campaign for Truman's release.

189,eabakkum,A warning against spying and oppression?,8,3 January 2012,"I used the last days of December to watch some films, that had impressed me about a decade ago. The film The Truman Show was among them. Around 2000 I watched The Truman Show several times, and tried to analyze its contents. Like many modern movies, it contains an ambiguous message. Obviously the leading theme is the obtrusive invasion of our private life by the producers of television programs. The common life of individual people is transformed into entertainment, not just in the form of a single commentary, but by means of regular (weekly or even daily) broadcastings. At the time this type of entertainment was still a novelty. I even remember that shortly after The Truman Show a similar film about the topic was released, titled EdTV. Since 2000 the so-called reality TV has become a common vehicle of entertainment, probably because it is cheap and doesn't require any careful considerations. Nevertheless The Truman Show has withstood the ravages of time, and still succeeds in fascinating me. At the time, I interpreted the story as a critique on the unwanted invasion of your private living space by unknown outsiders. For passer-bys clearly and intentionally block Burbanks passage, when he is in a hurry, both in a hospital, on the sidewalk, or in the file on the highway. During a chance meeting a cop unexpectedly happens to know his name. When Burbank wishes to visit the Fijis, the posters in the local traveling agency try to instil a fear for flying, and the flights to the Fijis happen to be fully booked for at least a month. Burbank discovers that in an eternal procession the same group of strangers circulates around his house. As a whole the chance of an accidental conjunction of circumstances becomes negligible, and Burbank logically concludes that it is all premeditated. The only surprise is his slowness in the uptake, considering that he had already been encysted for thirty years, since his birth. In the end Burbank succeeds in escaping from his artificial, repressing and hostile world. But now, after another ten years, I doubt that this is really the leading theme. For we live in a world, where you can simply watch the home life of your neighbors by infiltrating their computer through the net and controlling their web-cam by means of spy-ware. And if you can not do this, your government or an ICT firm certainly can. Apparently The Truman Show is not so much a protest against a threatening future Big Brother society (after the narration of the totalitarian society by George Orwell), as a warning against the actual way of living, that develops around us. Thus the story becomes a hotchpotch of undesirable developments: for instance the intrusion of advertising in our lives. Or the social encysting and gossiping in the small community. Perhaps even the oppression by social conventions in general. Or the spying by the state and enterprises on their citizens and costumers, which in the professed age of terrorism has become unbounded. Apparently the narrative of The Truman Show is more a shower of grains of shot than a well-targeted critique. So although I still appreciate the film and its invitation to ponder, it is clearly not the monument of resistance that I presumed twelve years ago. A pity. Disappointing.",The Truman Show
190,Cedric_Catsuits,We are all believers,7,26 May 2006,"What's great about this film is that although ostensibly it's about society's obsession with TV and voyeurism, the influences appear to be things like 1984, The Prisoner, and even man's attempt at spirituality. There's a little bit of Truman in all of us - seriously, how much freedom do we really have? Don't you ever feel like you have no control, and wonder if there is someone out there plotting your destiny? A clever film indeed, if only because it raises issues and encourages us to ask questions. Also beautifully played - for the most part straight - by Carrey. Natascha McElhone is wonderful if under-used. Harris is surprisingly good as the self-appointed creator (of what, exactly - in his mind?!) Original, inspiring, warm and funny.

I basically hated him in every other movie, mostly in DUMB AND DUMBER, the MASK and THE CABLE GUY. In this movie, however, he plays remarkably restrained and he actually shows emotions. WAY TO GO, Jim.
The rest of the movie is basically very entertaining. There are a lot of interesting touches, such as Truman's wife constantly doing advertisements for all kinds of rubbish at the worst possible times, and the reactions of the people viewing the show. The idea behind the movie raises some interesting issues on privacy and on exactly what the media should be allowed to, although these issues could have been investigated a little further. When you really start to think about it, however, the movie just doesn't add up. The idea of a TV studio the size of a small island and a man not knowing that he's in it are just a little too much to swallow, especially when you realize that nobody on the island can do ANYTHING at all. I mean, is it that hard to actually hire a bus driver or a ferry captian instead of an actor ?

At the end, it was a conversation between god and his staff. Generally speaking, it was interesting for us to design the world and observe the life of ran. As one of the ubiquitous pretense deep junior high students, I also added a lot of pretend words such as ""we are all the lambs of god"" at the end. I remember that the Chinese teacher at that time was very good, read my diary did not say anything, in fact, I was sick to the point that after she read will knock me out and then to god that report: ""boss, this guy has seen through."" When I think about it, I really fit all the characteristics of paranoia.Now, maybe it was because I had a strong sense of self, and my life was too stereotyped, I had too little contact with new things, I was out of touch with the society, so I could not have a sense of integration, so I fell into a passion. But these are normal junior high school students at that time of the common disease, why other baby although is also a pair of homework pressure wilting not pull that bird but its mind is so simple so sunshine so bright? It makes me wonder if I have a personality defect. I could not accept such a terrible fact, so I could only comfort myself with the thought that they all thought like this, but only kept silent.Later, when I watched the Truman show, my eyes filled with tears. This is the real version of my diary! Then I found that tengzi no. 2 male and tezuka have a number of short stories said is the same theme, so I wet, I feel good, my waist is not sour, my legs do not hurt, I go upstairs also have strength! Because so many people have tossed and turned over this idea, it's at best classified as ""a common psychological myth in adolescence"" rather than ""a common symptom of late paranoid paranoia."" Like the other bizarre sensation, ""double vision,"" this 20% delusion +10% paranoia +40% unreality +30% mistrust should have a psychological name, but I never found one. Tengzi fujio's short story does give this feeling a name, the Hong Kong version of the book is translated as ""sense of alienation,"" I think this word is only seven or eight accurate.Then again, that Chinese teacher may really be god's hand. Because I thought that if she knocked me unconscious that would prove that I was thinking the right thing, then she might also be thinking, this guy must be thinking that if I knock him unconscious that would prove that he was thinking the right thing, so I'm not going to knock him unconscious. So I thought: she knew that if she knocked me unconscious, she would prove that I was right. So she didn't knock me unconscious.

At the beginning i thought it was boring, but i was able to understand because i already knew a bit what it was about. The best moment in the film was when they showed the ""Tru-Talk"" theme. I think this movie also should have been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, the one for Best Editing and the one for Best Music. It probably wouldn't have won all of them, but it certainly deserved the one for Best Screenplay & Editing. This movie is really fabulous and it is impossible for me to imagine how anyone cannot enjoy it.",The Truman Show

The story in the starting will confuse you a little bit but then as it slowly progress, it is going to take a firm grasp on you as if you want the guy to know the truth. Jim Carey is best in acting roles like this and he did his job very nicely. Initially if you will think of the film's story then you are bound to laugh at the weird concept but the way it is presented to you is commendable. One thing that looks too stupid all the time is the question which is where is the government? How is an innocent man from his childhood is being made a mockery. But I must say the concept was weird but it was fun to watch this.""A must watch for all.""",The Truman Show
199,TheOny13,One of the best movies of the decade!,10,21 July 2019,"Had the chance to watch this movie only now, but I was completely stunned by how good this movie was. When I'll think back on the classics of this decade (the 90's) like The Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, Saving Private Ryan, The Green Mile I'll be adding this movie too.The premise was very simple and yet the way the movie develops itself is fantastic. You basically know from the get-go who Truman is and what's The Truman Show. The Show itself is what surprises you, moves you, inspires you on so many levels. I'll mention some of them: 1. First there's the manipulation theme which by the way mentioning it in my time (the year I write this review) is so relevant and is amazing how a movie 21 years old at this time was able to predict something so big that is sort of happening right now. 2. Then there's the freedom theme which in this instance basically says: don't be what others or what this world may want you to be. Be yourself, find your own unique path! 3. This one is one that basically tormented Hollywood for decades to come and is the Life is a lie thing or Life is irrelevant or Life is meaningless in the way that everything is just on a loop. Everything that happens is not real, that you are living only a scenario or a dream (see Inception).I could go on and on about the whole messages this movie transmits but you get the point. Aside from that the performances are all fantastic especially from Ed Harris and Jim Carrey who gives one of his best ever performances. The only thing distracting from that are his momentarily Ace Ventura- moments, but aside from that is maybe on par with his performance from Eternal Sunshine of the Spottless Mind. The score is fantastic and well suited for this type of movie. Everything else is just flawless and if I were to pick a thing that bothered me or a thing I didn't like I would have to really search and nit pick it.A masterpiece in every way possible that surprised me, inspired me, moved me and entertained me a lot. 10/10",The Truman Show

I often heard this reference that ""my life is like the Truman Show"" and I never realized it was a movie, I'm sure everyone one of us has imagined atleast once in our lives if we are being controlled whether our actions are controlled by an external force. Jim Carrey has always been an outstanding actor and this movie just adds another one in his bag of masterpieces. The acting, storyline, cast and everything about this movie was just to the point.

202,datorsiers2,Like no other.,8,26 July 2015,"The Truman Show is an extra ordinary movie, to say the least, it revolves around Truman, who has no clue that all his actions have been recorded since the day he was born. Things start to get out of control for the show, when Truman starts finding out about the reality of his life.Jim Carrey was just perfect in his role, definitely one of his top movies, a shame he didn't end up winning an Oscar for this movie. Apart from that, i found it very interesting how other actors interacted around Truman, it feels as he should have got the hints of his life being a TV show much sooner, but of course it is just a movie.I think that the movie could have been longer and more detailed, it was just an awesome film, but more plot could have made it way better. It's sad that they didn't show Truman after he left the show, but it guess that wasn't possible because they couldn't film him anymore, because he was off the set. I loved the idea, they wanted to create a perfect life for a person, where they don't get to get in trouble and can just live peacefully, if it wasn't for Sylvia, Truman probably wouldn't have escaped the set ever. It almost made me believe by his last line, that Truman knew all along, that it was a show and he is the star of it, or did he know? That's a question i haven't seen explained anywhere.Nonetheless, a great watch, perfect idea, maybe it had some flaws, like almost all the movies do, but still - something different and interesting, that makes you think.",The Truman Show

The story is not too complicated, funny and yet with some melodramatic sadness. This strange melanchony is carried on through the entire film.Visual effects aren't really memorable, but the entire film's concept makes the thing outstand. Jim Carrey's performance adds to whatever's left out of the film, Ed Harris delivers nicely his character too. Next to that, homever, the ending didn't feel completely satisfying, and the music was not memorable at all.There's not too much to tell.

205,daniellawson-14-787057,A timeless commentary on society,9,21 July 2020,"POSITIVES:1) Jim Carrey really shows his power as a dramatic actor instead of just doing slapstick comedy
2) Ed Harris is, as always, flawless and plays a ""villain"" that you can really empathise with and understand his point of view; so much so that when he is speaking directly to Truman at the end he had me almost convinced that Truman should stay
3) The satirical comedy on society works fantastically; from the product placement on the show to the Truman merchandise we see during the shots of the audience
4) The film is concise and does not overstay it's welcome; but still manages to have real dramatic and emotional weightNEGATIVES:1) There are still times in which Jim Carrey acts more like the childish comedian that he is known for and I didn't like these moments
2) The film definitely requires a massive suspension of disbelief; especially during moments like when they tell you that the Truman Show set has been built directly behind the Hollywood sign and is so large that it can be seen from space",The Truman Show

Truman Burbank (jim Carrey) has spent his 30 years since birth living inside a giant studio that must be 15 or so miles across interacting with friends and parents and wives who are just actors.!! He's been fooled all these years but finally he's starting to wonder WTF is going on.Jim Carrey does a great job and so too Natasha NcElhone as the beauty who really cares about him - in contrast to his wife and best friend. But the real credit has to go to the director who made sure this potentially confusing movie was in fact not confusing at all.I love paranoia movies and this is a good one.

I've tried to discover what it is, but I couldn't.We are not used to see films like ""The Truman Show"", so some people can think it is quite confuse, but I don't think so. Above all, it is an adult fable about a man's life. It talks about many serious and complex subjects with sweetness.The acting in the film is great. Jim Carrey redeemed himself. I don't think he deserved the Oscar, but I recognize he has a very good performance in the film. Ed Harris has the best performance of his life as Christof and he deserved the Oscar more than James Coburn, although I think Billy Bob Thornton was also superb in ""A Simple Plan"". And there is Natasha McElhone (Truman's great love in the story), and we have to pay attention at her.The screenplay is unique, but I don't know if the thing that is missing is fault of the director or the writer. Maybe it was no one's fault. I really don't know. I just think that ""The Truman Show"" had everything to be a masterpiece. Well... It is almost...Rating: 9/10",The Truman Show
209,thefan-2,And the point was . . .?,4,4 May 1999,"What I liked about The Truman Show was the setting and the cinematography.  The production values are good, which sometimes impresses me more than it should.  At least in this case the resulting sense of realism is very satisfying.But the story seemed muddled and pointless, Truman goes through a random process of discovery, and then breaks free.  So what? Can it be possible that the message of this movie is that we watch too much TV? That many of us have trouble distinguishing entertainment from reality?  That everything in life is an illusion?  If it isn't one of these hoary platitudes, what is it?  Even when someone suggested that the movie is an updated version of the escape from the Garden of Eden, and so probably has something to do with loss of innocence, I still end up asking ""So what?""  There's a dorm-room earnestness about The Truman Show that left me cold.  You might love it.  It's definitely worth a try.The Truman Show may be like Citizen Kane, a movie that everyone knows is great but that hardly anyone asks for at the video rental store except extreme cineastes.",The Truman Show
210,Geofbob,A satire fit to stand alongside 1984,8,8 January 2002,"When I saw Peter Weir's film on its release, I was so engaged by Jim Carrey's wonderful performance as Truman Burbank, that I regarded the film overall as positive and life-enhancing. Seeing it again three years later, I find it a much bleaker experience. Ed Harris as director Christof is such a megalomaniac manipulator that he has perhaps drawn attention away from everybody else involved in the conspiracy against Truman, from the merest technician to the actors playing his best friend Marlon (Noah Emmerich) and his wife Meryl (Laura Linney). But not only are the production team and players involved in the conspiracy, but so are the millions of viewers of the show. So while we may applaud Truman's brave decision to enter the real world, we should be clear that he will find it full of voyeurs of low intellect and even lower moral standards, who for 30 years have been willing to be entertained by spying on him and depriving him of a real life. Some people might think that the film's satire is too severe, but I think it is fully justified. Day after day TV puts out programs every bit as inane and manipulative as that depicted in the film. It might be argued that, unlike Truman, the participants in ""confession"" TV and such programs as Big Brother are volunteers and know exactly what they are getting into. But in a sense they do not, since most of them are unaware of the ridiculous and unattractive sides of their characters which they will reveal to the cameras, and which are the real point of these programs.
The Truman Show stands comparison with George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-four as a satirical polemic against totalitarian interference in people's lives - but the threat now comes as much from the media as from Government.",The Truman Show

And I really liked the 'set effects' that were used...especially the 'errors' that popped up now and then.

It's a really enjoyable watch.I can't help feeling, however, that in the hands of a better director, and (as much as I love Jim Carrey) with a different lead actor, this movie could have been even better.

He deserved every award he won, and Andrew Niccol's screenplay was certainly better than Shakespeare in Love's, which won (and that annoyed me to no end).

You should all be ashamed of yourselves and perhaps re-evaluate yourselves to see if you actually HAVE any values. Let me get this straight: A human being (human life still matters to some), is trapped at birth (illegally detained, which is the legal equivalent of kidnapping) in an immense, dome-like structure and introduced to a cast of characters who play the part of his family, friends, etc. None of it is real, and it is all broadcast on TV, which is hugely-popular.I am trying not to become angry as I write this. This movie reveals a hidden danger in the human subconscious and all of you who approve of it are latent, misanthropic psychopaths.Let me ask you a rhetorical question: ""How far will you go for entertainment?""

Ed Harris shows that his acting is entering the superclass league. The script is grand. All the supporting actors give sterling performances. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll talk about it afterwards. And yet I can't help feeling it's not quite the five-star smash that all the other reviewers say it is. It's derivative (Stepford Wives, It's a Wonderful Life (the town), 1984, Philip Glass (even though he didn't write the music)), it has plot holes the size of Texas, it has a happy ending that struck me as more likely to be the result of voting by brainless preview audiences than the author's intent. But why carp? It's better than the average Hollywood film for sure and well worth the admission price.I think it's something to do with the things in which you've been immersed for a lifetime. The average film critic falls over in amazement when she discovers something that is not European and not utterly brainless because she has been raised on a vapid, soulless, utterly boring diet of literature and film based around the emptiness of family drama, where middle-class comment passes for politics and consideration of real intellectual ideas is anathema. On the other hand, the average spotty youth or youthess who has even glanced at the only true literature of the 20th century (I mean science fiction of course) or considered the history of philosophy, even at the amoebic level of ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"", will see The Truman Show and cry out ""Yeah, very pretty but tell us something new.""So, my advice to you is see the film.

Of course, cracks begin to show, especially when a lamp from the top of the huge dome that represents Truman's fictional world falls to the street.  (It's later revealed to Truman on his car radio that a plane has been shedding its parts in flight)  I found myself thinking of celebrities, even of Jim Carrey himself, who are constantly harassed with cameras and TV exposure.  This is the hidden message of the movie, because Truman is the victim of television exploitation without approval, which is wrong.Don't expect an over-the-top performance by Carrey, who does a good job of balancing the character's mildness and his insanity while discovering the weirdness that surrounds him.  One question remains unanswered throughout the film:  Does Truman actually have sex with the ""Co-star"" who plays his ""wife"" ?",The Truman Show

235,heyimmyx,Immy's review : A masterpiece,10,17 September 2020,"A philosophical, thought provoking film that is much darker than I remember. I love that ' The Truman show' appears as a harmless, innocent movie, but beneath the surface reveals a pretty horrifying concept about a man who has been controlled and deceived his whole life. The movie is haunting due to its rather tragic look at Truman's realisation that he doesn't have complete free will, and that he has been prevented from following his dreams. He is treated as a mere object for the sake of millions of people. Truman's character was introduced perfectly as we get a sense of his individual passions, dreams and inquisitive, loveable personality, thus making it all the more sad when we discover that his ambitions have been suppressed, and he is merely living the life he never wanted. Jim Carey's performance was gripping and spectacular as Truman, presenting himself with a child like vulnerability ; Clueless but full of wonder, and so we deeply sympathise with him. The Truman show's intelligence also lies in the fact that it forces you into the perspective of Truman's audience and like we're really watching him, so we ask ourselves the philosophical question 'Is it morally acceptable to make someone believe that the world they are living in is real, when it's not?'. The soundtrack was superb and added a sentimental, poignant feel to the overall atmosphere. My ONLY complaint would be that I wished they didn't film so much of the outer world, as I think it would have been better to keep it a mystery, creating more of a fear of the unknown. Overall, incredible performances, interesting characters and an intriguing plot make this movie a superb watch. Highly recommend!",The Truman Show
236,kevin142,Horrible truth,8,23 September 2005,"After Truman was born, he lived in a false world. His actions could be watched by every audience except himself. Even when he was sleeping. In this world only he was a real person. The other people were just the supporting roles. According to the producer Christof, they came on or quieted. So Truman's world was full of lies. One day he found the truth. He chose to leave the false world and lived his real life.Christof really was a cruel guy. How dare he made up a world for Truman? Everybody does not want to be cheated. It is meaningless to live in a fabricated world for any person. Although sometimes the truth is ugly, you have to accept it.This time Jim Carrey brought us not only laughs but also tears. He made the role so perfect that he deserved fully to be the best actor (Golden globe award).An excellent thought-provoking movie. 8/10",The Truman Show

A story about the ultimate betrayal on one hand, a deconstruction of the hyper-realist nature of our post-modern lives on the other, and an unintentional retelling of Doctor Who  Vengeance On Varos on the side, this is really something of a minor masterpiece.  Carrey's Truman Burbank is a put-upon hero to rank with George Bailey from It's A Wonderful Life, a man whose destiny is to come face to face with `God' (and it's also better than Bruce Almighty).

239,Willie-12,Good movie!,8,22 October 1998,"The Truman Show is most certainly one of the best movies so far this year. This movie was funny, sad, and powerful with performances that are top notch.  Jim Carrey better get an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Truman Burbank.  Carrey was perfect as the typical ""Leave It To Beaver"" kind of guy, who turns out to be a real person, who has real feelings.  You see, it's not the ""Leave It To Beaver"" part that is so great about his performance, it's the metamorphic change that occurs in Truman where he moves from the ""Leave It To Beaver"" guy to the real man, who will stop at nothing to know the truth.  This isn't a movie where you can just sit back and enjoy the ride.  You have to think, and if you look close enough, you will see the quietly powerful message; the message of hope and freedom, the idea that no innocent man or woman can be kept in some place against their will, and the idea that if deception is involved, then eventually truth will prevail and hope and freedom will be restored.",The Truman Show
240,blairgallop7,The Truman Show is truly a classic and truly original,10,16 August 2007,"This is one of the most creative movies I have ever watched.The Truman Show stars Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank who is a salesman who suspects that his life isn't as normal as it would seem as he is unknowingly the star of a reality television show which is filming 24/7 that is focused on his life entirely.When I first heard of this movie,I thought it would be a comedy but I soon realised it was more of a drama however there was still some comedy in it.The film also has a good supporting cast in the form of Laura Linney,Noah Emmerich and Ed Harris.It also had a good director in the form of Peter Weir but the one thing that should have been done is that the Academy should have at least given Jim Carrey an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor as he rightfully deserved to be nominated at least and because he is a great actor but would be Hollywood's most underrated actor.But either way,this film was a very great and creative film.",The Truman Show
241,nzswanny,Amusingly subtle comedy that parodies TV shows.,10,6 September 2017,"The Truman Show is one of Jim Carrey's most successful comedy films along with Dumb And Dumber, The Mask, Ace Ventura and Liar Liar, however this movie is the most well received by the film critics and earning an 8.1/10 on IMDb and a 94% on Rotten Tomatoes (as well as a 90 on Metascore but nobody gives a damn about Metascore). So it's no wonder that some people are still thinking about watching the movie and reading reviews, and one of those people used to be me once, and I'm surprised you're reading my reviews out of all the ones. I'm glad you're reading this, and I'll try to give you the best effort for a review possible so you can see whether you'd like this movie or not.The Truman Show can be interpreted as a basic comedy movie to pass time by some but it can also be interpreted as a misunderstood masterpiece because of the specializing in cinematography, subtlety and wittiness in the subject of TV shows. In reality TV shows, people like Truman live in them for basically the entirety of their lives and the only difference is that they are fully aware that they have been living in one while Truman is completely unaware. However, Truman begins to gain suspicion after strange events happen and he begins to suspect things while we, as the viewer, are completely aware that the strange events are because of the fact that he is in a TV show. As usual, Jim Carrey brings his humorous characteristics as he reacts to these strange situations such as product placement, coincidental happenings and bad luck and we, as the viewer, are amused when we watch him in these situations because we know he is in a TV show. While these situations are funny they are actually very thought-provoking and they may question your life itself and how the process of Reality TV Shows work and whether or not the actors in Coronation Street are like Truman - except that they are self-aware of it being a TV Show. We then watch these TV Shows with heaps of effort and we enjoy them, however are we really to care of the impact of TV Shows? After an episode we just flick it onto another channel until dinner is ready.Still not sure whether you will like this or not? Well, if you are a big fan of Jim Carrey's outrageous but intelligent humour then I think you will enjoy this movie. While this is a lot more subtle and thought-provoking in terms of humour than Jim Carrey's previous comedies, it still sticks to the humour we know and love from Jim Carrey however on a lower volume than it is usually played. If you are a fan of thought-provoking, cynical satires then I think you will enjoy this film as well. If you are a fan of good cinematography techniques then I think you'll enjoy analyzing this film. If you simply want to watch a good film then watch this. If you are not a fan of Jim Carrey, satire, cinematography or good films then this film is not for you. Simply put, this film is a comedic masterpiece that may be to some tastes and below others depending on the type of films you usually take interest in, but for me it was a delightful treat that just whizzed past my expectations.",The Truman Show

243,hooma814,I love the Truman Show,9,18 December 2020,"This movie is so unique, and is still so good today. It is one of the few films that stays with me in my thoughts every now and again. The thought like many others have is ""what if I am in the Truman Show?"" It leaves you with a haunting perception of reality in second guessing everyone's behaviours, what if everyone is a paid actor. The acting is first class, especially from Jim Carrey who sells his soul really with his next few films. This movie has such a good view on what it means to be human, our ideas of freedom and life in general. This is a must watch for any one for sure.",The Truman Show
244,borowiecsminus,A Rare Gleam in the World of Comedy,9,13 August 2016,"Comedy is a barren wasteland. It's mostly populated with bad actors in good roles (Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller), or fantastic actors in terrible roles (Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci). However, once in a while a movie defies all that. Once in a while, people come together to make a piece of comedy that is truly great filmmaking. It happened in ""Silver Linings,"" ""Joy,"" and ""What About Bob."" And it happened here.From the director of ""Dead Poets Society,"" another dramedy with a comedy actor, comes this beautiful tale of Truman Something. When I saw this movie, I did not think it was about what it was about. I thought it was more along the lines of ""Good Morning Vietnam."" But instead, this movie acts like Inception, and in a great way, too. It's thought-provoking.There's a moral dilemma in this film, and that's the idea that the viewer is trying desperately to cast the blame. At first, it doesn't even seem like it's necessarily an evil thing to do. I mean, his life is made to be great. But as the film progresses, it's clear Truman is being made a victim. But who's the villain here? The catch is: it's hard to tell. Is it ever actor and actress on that show for putting up with it? Is it Christoph's, for designing it? It is his parents', for allowing the show to adopt him? Or is it everyone watching, giving the show high ratings to make them keep going? The film has a deep undertone, saying ""If we give publicity to people we hate, and a system we hate, is it just proving that their system works?"" And that message rings truer than ever in the desolate landscape of politics we live in.But all that thought-provoking stuff is peppered by Jim Carrey in what is -I'll just say it- far and away his best work ever. And it proves that this world has something against Carrey by constantly putting him in roles that are so incredibly poorly written and just say ""act stupid"" and you feel like you're watching a terrible movie. This movie proves that he's a real actor. He can give real performances, if the writers will for once, give him the chance to act once in a while.But there are things that prevented this movie from getting those last two stars.The first is a lot of little oversights, like the CinemaSins kind. I usually don't care, but there were just so many here. I won't list them all, but the most bothersome one is that they claim to have the world's smallest cameras, and yet when Meryl gets scared, she knows exactly where the camera is to look into it. There's about six more I could list, but I won't.The second, and more important, is Christoph's character. I get that he's a little hypocritical, but still. There's a lot of ""who is this guy"" with Christoph. Not in a good way, in a bad way, like, it doesn't seem like the same guy would do all the different things he did and say all the different things he said in this movie.That being said, this is one of the nicest movie reviews I've ever given. This truly is one of the greatest comedies to ever hit the small screen and Jim Carrey can call it his masterwork.",The Truman Show
245,irishm,First time I managed to tolerate Jim Carrey,8,14 November 2016,"For quite a while I refused to watch this based on who the star was. I was familiar with his ""style"" and didn't care for it. I finally gave in to all the assurances that this film wasn't like his other performances, and I really liked it.The reviewers who say it's like an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" aren't far off. But I like the fact that it's not taken too seriously, unlike many TZ episodes... this subject matter, as evidenced by many of the ""hated it"" reviews, could easily have been presented and intended to be taken in a deadly-serious way, but it's not, and I like that.There could easily have been a ""show-down"" scene at the end between a disappointed, unbalanced, angry Truman and his ""creator"", Christoph. I usually don't like open-ended conclusions, but in this case I thought it worked. Truman remains the nice, trusting guy he always was... he sees his newfound freedom as a gift, a long-awaited chance to see what the actual world has to offer, and he takes it, with no visible hard feelings. Why not? That's his character and his nature. A confrontation scene would have been interesting and most likely well-played by both Carrey and Harris, but it wasn't necessary. The payoff for the audience is that Christoph loses everything in the blink of an eye (fame, power, income, and the biggie: complete control), while Truman goes off to begin his REAL life (and presumably track down his lost love somewhere along the way).It's especially interesting to view this today, with the reality-TV wave cresting. The real people on these current shows are called ""cast members"", their lives are called ""storylines"" which are played out in ""seasons"", and sometimes it can be hard to remember that they're actual human beings.""The Truman Show"" started, by Christoph's own admission, with an unwanted pregnancy.

246,daveisit,Lawn Mowing At Its Best,8,10 July 2005,"""The Truman Show"" owes a lot to the direction of Peter Weir. Weir refuses to pump out the movies in a search for extra dollars. Instead he chooses wisely and directs brilliantly. Just by looking at a list of his movies will surprise and even amaze you. So as you would imagine ""The Truman Show"" is another success.Truman Burbank has the perfect life, or so he thought until finally his life long suspicions about his world begin to unravel. Even though the idea for Truman is not totally original, it is thought provoking enough and allows the audience to wonder, what if? If you think this couldn't happen, just look back over the years at the stupidity of the human race and think again.Jim Carrey once again nails his role, as do the entire cast. It is rare he fails to perform at a level that perfectly complements the movie and its genre. This is something he does not receive enough credit for. Acting for a comical role or a more dramatic role requires no less effort for the performance to be spot on.",The Truman Show

It's a terrifying thought to think you are constantly being monitored and purposely manipulated without cognizance. Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is just an average person (well not really) being watched by the entire world since his birth. Unaware of the world that exists outside of Seahaven, it's sad to consider a man with such genuine and adventurous dreams being limited in his life because of money. Having your life televised is one thing, but doing it without informed consent and only deceit and trickery is the primary reason this film strikes chords with people. It's a generally accepted view that beings should have the right to do with their lives as they wish. This fundamental freedom is taken away from an innocent person whose only mishap was being born to parents that didn't want him!Growing up in modern society, it is well known that we tend to take things for granted. Whether you're living in a closed dome or restricted by the government, freedom to choose is one of the most innate yet exploited aspects of society. It's an unnerving thought but maybe we are all living in a closed environment, playing the pawns; we just don't realize it.",The Truman Show
249,Manal1987,An existential masterpiece,9,9 May 2011,"Exceptionally genuine story with many underlying thought-provoking ideas. On one level, you can think of this story as an attack against an inhumane, consumerist, media-controlled society where everything is to be sold and benefited from, even human lives. On another level, the story is nothing but an existential pondering on the man-god relationship. Truman represents the once helpless, mind-controlled man who gradually starts to break free by pushing the limits of his reality's already given axioms. Some may not like this saying it represents a breaking away from god (represented by Christof, the show director), but I think it just encourages man to think outside the box and pushes him to refuse whatever reality imposes upon him... to, simply, unleash his imagination. Jim Carrey did a great job, but the one who really blew my mind away was Ed Harris with his extremely grand and mature performance.. I just couldn't take my eyes off him!",The Truman Show
250,matlefebvre20,Satire in high definition,7,12 October 2006,"The first one who imagined a concept similar to ""The Truman Show"" is Plato. It is known today as the ""Allegory of the Cave"". The great philosopher told the story of a man chained up in a cave and forced to see the shadows made by a fire, assuming that it's the real life. Ultimately, he discovers that what he saw was fake and he tries to accommodate to reality.Twenty-two hundred years later, Plato is replaced by Australian filmmaker Peter Weir and the sinister cave is now called 'reality television'. The allegory is now called ""The Truman Show"".Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, an insurance company employee who is also the star of the show, although he's not aware of it. He lives in what for him is Seahaven, which is in fact a giant domed-studio located just outside L.A. He (obviously) never left Seahaven of his life.Seahaven is supposed to be a peaceful city located on an island on the seaside. In order to keep Truman in the city, the crew finds many ways, including cutting off bridges and simulating a nuclear accident. Moreover, Truman can't leave by the sea because the producers voluntarily infused him with hydrophobia when his father 'died' in a boat accident.However, in recent days, many strange events occur and lead Truman to believe that something is not right in Seahaven. A 'plane piece' falls from the sky, but Truman finds that it strangely looks like a projector. And there's also that elevator, whose back falls and let see the crew for a second.This sounds like a crazy and overly exaggerated media satire. But there's one place where ""The Truman Show"" wins: the timing couldn't have been better. In a modern society where reality shows invade the little screen, ""The Truman Show"" is a strong metaphor of the dangers and the consequences of permanent broadcasting of a person's life.The movie is not perfect, but just its concept makes it a winner. The acting is good, especially when you think that this movie is 'fiction-within-fiction'. There are two movies in a single one. Jim Carrey is only aware of half of it and it looks real. Carrey gets one of his greatest roles, mainly because he finally shows what he's able to do and he shows that maniac comedy is not the only thing he can do.Ed Harris appears as Christof, the creator and the director of the show. He's responsible for the Machiavellian tricks made in order to thwart Truman's escape plans and to keep him in Seahaven. This determination is well-hidden by his cold regard and his continuous calmness.The greatest characters of the movie are perhaps the viewers themselves, as we regularly see them at different moments. Every time, they're at the same time at the same place, doing the same thing. Just like if there was nothing else to do. Or maybe nothing 'important' to do.They are the figures that stand for today's reality-show viewers. They're stuck in front of their TVs like if nothing else mattered and there was nothing else to do. Like if it was as essential as breathing. They're not aware that they're wasting their own lives watching the same person living his own life.There's a quote from Christof that I like: ""I am the creator of a television show that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions."" That's how a real TV director would speak. By telling lies. By telling what appear to be good words, which are in fact empty words. This is the kind of hidden quotes that are part of the linking between the satire and the reality.The only major gap between satire and reality in ""The Truman Show"" (and perhaps the most arguable aspect of it) is that Truman Burbank is not aware that he's constantly filmed. In reality shows, people know that they're filmed. It's just that the overabundance of cameras and tests ultimately drive them crazy. It would have provided an even more powerful movie, but as long as this movie is good, it's less worrying.What is different about Plato's allegory and ""The Truman Show"" is that the latter doesn't have any conclusion. In the Allegory, the man gets out of the cave and has to face the sunlight and, after a long time, he succeeds. The last image we get from Truman is when he gets out from the studio and we never see him contemplating the real world. So we don't know what's gonna happen. We don't know how he will face the sunlight...We don't see him, so good afternoon, good evening and good night Truman!",The Truman Show
251,nodlimax,Amazing movie in a horrifying way,9,2 September 2020,The Truman Show is a really scary movie if you really think about the story and characters that are involved. And the great thing is that this movie actually makes you think about the various aspects and how imprisonment and torture can come in different forms.And the story of this movie becomes even more terrifying if you think about what may have happened to the character of Truman after the credits started rolling.I think the actors did a brilliant job in this movie and personally I'd say that this was Jim Carries best performance of his career.

We would all love to have the world revolve around us, but this film depicts that it can be distressing, as it was for Truman.I thought the movie was one of the best films I have ever seen because of its great acting and unpredictability, but I was deeply upset that this movie was not nominated for Best Picture this year for the Oscars.  C'mon, look at ""The Full Monty"".  That was nominated for Best Picture last year???  I was glad, nonetheless, that it was nominated for Best Director, Supporting Actor (Ed Harris), and Screenplay.

Already this week, the CBS network is building up anticipation for Survivor 3: Africa and Big Brother 2 while other broadcast and cable networks follow with much of the same (MTV's REAL WORLD of a few years ago).  In the world of Truman Burbank, the all-seeing, all-knowing (supposedly) Christof plays ""God"" with maniacal gusto.  He's like the Grand Inquisitor in THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV. Director Peter Weir and Original Screenplay author Andrew Niccol have shown convincingly their audience that today's Pop Culture in the light of day is pathologically or at least neurotically obsessed with ""on-camera"" peers who have been manipulated into ""maze-like"" situations and problems. Mainstream TV audiences (according to ratings surveys) want to watch religiously as people are ""voted off"" or ""lose a challenge"" for a weekly dosage of bread and circuses.  From scene to scene, Truman gets tormented, teased and finally caught up in a deadly hurricane as his TV audience sits back and breathes sighs of relief.  He does have one true friend inside his tormenting contrived ""universe"": a beautiful informer-traitor named Sylvia/Lauren who cheers his efforts to find a real world apart from the Land of the Smirks, Patronizing Product Placements, and Constant Surveillance.

257,ram-30,A story full of Christ symbols.,10,6 January 2005,"The first time I watched ""The Truman Show"" when it came out in 1998 I was impressed with the story, a delightful Science Fiction tale, and with the acting, the movie proving that Jim Carrey could do more on the big screen than talk through his butt. When I revisited this film 5 or 6 years later, I was even more impressed. For one thing, this story has proved very prophetic. How many reality shows dominate the TV today? It also has many allegorical layers that I missed the first time. I think 5 years ago I had a sense of some attempt at symbolism in ""The Truman Show""; the Ed Harris character is CHRISTos, he's the creator and he's up above over seeing everything. However, the more I watch it, I see Truman Burbank as a Christ figure also: a man singled out, sacrificing his life for the sake of others, a man who knows he does not belong in this world, a man who ascends to his true home at the end of the story in fine ""resurrection"" style. There's even a scene where he appears to be walking on water. Again, it's an entertaining story on the surface level but like Truman himself I hope the viewers can rise above the surface and see a new world.",The Truman Show
258,krumski,One of the films for which the Nineties will be remembered,10,19 February 2000,"I believe that, in the future, when the 90s are looked back upon, The Truman Show will be seen as one of its truly representative films, not only for its high quality but for its unerring evocation of one of the most prominent themes of our times: the out of control nature of the media, and its invasion of our personal lives. Think about how many movies over this past decade have used this theme as a jumping off point: Natural Born Killers, Mad City, Wag the Dog, To Die For, The Cable Guy, Quiz Show, EdTv, . . I could go on, but you get the idea. The Truman Show towers over all these films because instead of being a polemic, it casts its story in the form of a fable; you're free to buy what's happening as ""real"" or simply metaphorical, and the story works equally well either way. Because there's no direct reference to any current media images (no MTV or CNN or Jay Leno monologues about Truman and his life) the story exists outside of time - it could take place either in the future, a fictionalized present, or an imagined past: it's never made clear and it doesn't matter. By not trying to be up to the minute, The Truman Show succeeds in being timeless.However, that is only one of its many successes. The story manages to be involving on the levels of drama and comedy simultaneously. Truman's dilemma is always achingly real to him, and yet as spectators we can't help but see how funny are the preposterous ways in which the situation is kept going (the posters in the travel agency, for example, or the teacher telling Truman ""You're too late, everything's been discovered already.""). To be sure, it's a sinister humor, one that chills at the same time it amuses. It reminded me at times of the coldness and bemused misanthropy pervading such Kubrick films as Lolita, Dr. Strangelove, and 2001. And yet, amazingly, at the same time it also had - through Truman - a hopefulness and a wonderment that was reminiscent of the very best of Spielberg. Now, I can't think of two directors who are more different from one another, and by evoking both, the film shows an almost unparalleled range and vision.I'd like to say Jim Carrey was a surprise here, but in fact he wasn't, not to me anyway; from the time I saw him in The Mask (in his Stanley Ipkiss scenes) I always suspected he had a role like this in him. He's effective and believable in a more toned-down part, although I believe that the role is such a gem - and so assured of audience sympathy - that nearly any actor could have played it and been equally effective. The true star here is the director, Peter Weir, who after this and Fearless must now be considered in the genius category. Not only does he create a compelling and totally believable world, but he uses camera angles in a sly and totally original way to subtly indicate to the audience the depth of surveillance involved in Truman's world. And he comes up with a cornucopia of unforgettable images, all slightly surreal and menacing, while at the same time containing a strange and gripping beauty: the ""sunset"" scene where the sun and moon hang next to each other in the sky; the nighttime image of all the actors on the set, arm in arm, searching for Truman with guard dogs and flashlights (definite shades of Invasion of the Body Snatchers); the final scene of Truman, at the ""ends of the earth"" seemingly ""walking on the water"" (an image Magritte or Dali would have been proud to have painted); and, perhaps most memorably, the supremely surprising yet totally brilliant moment when the moon metamorphisizes  into a giant searchlight. Even out of context, these scenes have a stunning visual power, and add immensely to the film's overall subject and theme.But even if you're not in the mood for a serious message, or a meditation upon the popular media and its role in our lives, it's possible to enjoy The Truman Show on just the most basic level of an interesting story, well told. It's a ""quest"" film, but because of the way it's set up and its sly humor, it can also be enjoyed as a *parody* of a quest film (after all, it's ""only"" a TV show). Its ""major themes"" can be taken as a parody of a movie that would like to have ""major themes."" The film achieves this dual effect (significant and yet not significant) because of the way it refracts everything through the television lens - which, as we all know, trivializes every subject it encounters: yes, even a man's quest to discover the meaning of his life and start entirely anew. The very final shot of the movie, which some people complain is too glib and abrupt, is actually perfect because it emphasizes this point with such deadly satirical force.The Truman Show: entertaining, thought provoking, eerie, sad, triumphant - just about the most complete movie experience you could ever have. Definitely one of the classics, not only of our time, but of ALL time.",The Truman Show

The director Peter Weir and writer Andrew Niccol must be specially praised for such a work.Now don't overlook Jim Carry, he is a master man as always with Ed Harris' intense performance. This movie may also remind one about the story of a frog in a well who thinks that the well is everything, the whole world. Not like that but being a comedy it shows what might happen with such a life entrapped yet unaware of anything. At the same time we see the desire of freedom and lusty minds who seeks entertainment. It questions as to what do we prefer, humanity or false entertainment at any cost for momentary escape from reality in our life.The film is certainly not preachy but makes one to think about various cobwebs that are and that may entrap us time to time. The thing that lacked in the movie are, as i felt, editing and cinematography. It was typical and simple. Some special things should have been done to provide complete impact to the viewer but i wonder if that would make the move more artificial.

262,nelliebell-1,A Special Edition,6,11 November 2007,"The motion picture,""The Truman Show"" is not so much an interest but a shock.The picture is not only a discredit but such a fallacious argument as to set back the human race some 150 years.The reference to 150 years was to refer to a time when there was a Civil War in what was then the United States against the Confederate States of America.The conflict was to cause the abolishment of slavery as an exercise in any state right issue whereby a human being was denied the right to life,liberty and the pursuit to happiness.The Truman Show is a latter day attempt to undermine the very foundations of that which there was given the last full measure so that we might enjoy a new birth of freedom.A paraphrase taken from the Gettysburg Address when spoken in July 1863 by then President Abraham Lincoln.There is in fact such an arrogant position had by this film that we might be said to enter into a new world order whereby a state is indeed introduced as a Godless Overseer and right holder to the human being.There is such an inbred contempt for Trevor Burbank who is the victim of this raid of the heart that a story told by Civil War historian Shelby Foote,told of a slave who was the property of an over seer on a Virginia Plantation.The slave managed to escape and won his freedom by moving stealthily through the underground railroad to a community North of the Confederate territory.He was, as fate would have it,to join union forces and at a time later was to be part of a Union move against the South whereby he would come directly across the very land whereby he was once a slave.The story told of the very deliberate seeking out and killing of the overseer with whom he was in slaved to.If this be worth anything it would be that Trevor Burbank should not only seek out and kill Christoph but every person directly associated with the broadcast.This is more than a mere crime this is slavery.The degree to which the ways of this world have parted is that we hardly recognize ourselves because with the passing of time came the advent of telecommunications and the conceit of another form though in fact it was to be the same old story yet in another form.That is what we are in fact looking out in this,""The Truman Burbank"" Show.It is a very real attempt to thumb there noses at the foundations of a Democracy and flaunt their victimization of one Truman Burbank.The characterization of all those around the life of Truman Burbank share not common ground to such an extent that all of life seems merely to be lacking in color and even back bone,such is the offense!This coldly impersonal affront even onto decency is so vile as to be culpable and worthy to die as many times as necessary so as to rid the world of this malady once and for all.Christof should be sought out as stealthily as the story told of the former slave noted above and killed,because he is a Godless Monster.This order should be done with due diligence and with prejudice aforethought so that all associated with this event should see the end of their days on this Earth.There is nothing timid in this attempt to silence a heart beat and there should not be anything timid in its roar back as well.Let the human heart roar back at the attempt upon its place here as this system is as in human as it is a new world order.There is nothing here but a discredit and it is nothing but a discredit that is represented but this attempt upon our place in this world.Though we are in fact looking at a Motion Picture,the entertainment vehicle that it represents is not entertaining at all but in fact represents a hatred for honesty,for nature and for love.This film is an un-natural affront to entertainment and goes beyond mere viewing pleasure to a virtual contempt for civilization.This film is in fact a very violent attack upon life and can be construed as a promise of what maybe coming to a theater near you.You as a theater going public are warned of the propensity to pooh pooh this hatred and dismiss it without the right of way being taken back.The inability to right the wrong breaches the very cloth so sacred in our devotion to duty,honor and fidelity.There is present a matter of life and death with only judgement to wish for in the passing of the days.The end time is now upon this world and it is indeed a time to judge those who have sought to judge us.Let this be a prophecy foretold!",The Truman Show
263,Primtime,"Interesting Story, could have done more with it",7,26 March 1999,"I finally watched the Truman Show after all of the talk I had heard about it and all of the articles I had read. I really had high expectations for the film that was supposingly ""robbed"" of a Best Picture Nomination. I must say I felt let down.Anyone who thinks that Jim Carrey's performance is Oscar-worthy is insanely out of their mind. Saying that is similar to asking why Tom Hanks didn't get an Oscar nod for ""The 'burbs."" Carrey gives a decent performance that to me differed in no way from any of the performances that he has done before. There are still elements of his comic side (scene in which he drives around in circles trying to foil the other cars) present here and he really never comes through with any element of real drama, it all seems fake. However, who knows? Hanks started his acting career by doing mainly comedies until Philadelphia and look what happened to him.The film itself is directed well by Peter Weir who I felt had so much potential to use other interesting facets of the life of Truman. It seems that we are given a quick intro into the life of Truman and are all too quickly rushed into his ploy to get out of the dome and fly to Fiji. If only the first half of the film was devoted to what life is like for Truman and some of the neat ways everything that he does ends up on camera, this film could have been much better. We are hardly introduced to his family, friend and co-workers before the film turns on itself and leaves a lot of interesting issues untouched.The Truman show is a good film overall, however, not even close to the near-greatness achieved in two of the Best Picture nominees that I have seen so far (Saving Private Ryan, Shakespeare In Love).

Although a poor man's representation  but surely a pretty good one.Ever since the infant (Jim) was in the womb  the Director(Demi God) , with the help of scientific advancement & technology, took the entire growth process, delivery, childhood, adulthood, marriage.basically outlined the life cycle of the child born. The human Director was trying to act God in front of the other viewers and the rest of the viewers  ie. common mass were watching it helplessly  rather enjoying the candid attitude and behavioral pattern of Jim Carrey.They stopped him from pursuing his own desires, failed him in school, rest of all the others who were with him were just a part of the huge studio as made by the Director and were acting all the time  making a fool of him  so basically he had no true friend  all actors !But a human Director is after all just a human. In comes a Lady  who tries to warn Jim of his delusion and gives him hints of his freedom. But soon the Director and the other team members take over and make Jim fall in love and even eventually marry the one they chose for him. He was shown carrying on with life reluctantly when suddenly he realizes that things are not what it seems to be  he then starts to investigate and finally break opens the cocoon (studio premises) he had been living in for so long ! Demi-God a.k.a. Director tries to give him a lot of hard ships  storm, tempest etc. but he could not stop Truman (Jim) from manifesting his own true self !This is the case with every human being  but most of them are happy as actors , some as helpless knowledgeables witnessing the suffering of a poor man who is being fooled by the entire world but are still sitting pretty about it  very rare few have the guts to break open the cocoon like Swami Vivekananda and his kinds- who, when open up their respective cocoons, let the entire world know of it and its possibilities !",The Truman Show

269,HollisWoods,Great Cinematography! A Jim Carrey Classic!,8,3 March 2021,"I don't know about you, but as a kid, I went through a phase where I thought my life was a sitcom. I'd dance while brushing my teeth, pretending that my theme song played as I got ready and I'd pretend to be on talk shows to talk about the show. Now whether I watched Truman Show or not back then, this movie reminded of me of that time in my life. It really is an interesting concept if you think about it. There's plenty of theories about us existing in a simulation, so you never know.So Truman's life is a television show and he doesn't know it. Not only is that a premise for a unique story, but it led to really interesting camera angles. There were ""hidden cameras"" everywhere, from cameras on the wall, the mirrors, and even buttons on clothes. What I like was that every shot with Truman was from the point of the view of the Truman Show, so we were watching right with the audience.One of my favorite shots was that moment right after the storm. After Christoff released his ""wrath of God"" with the storm, there's a moment where Truman is lying on his back hanging over the side of the boat with rope wrapped around him. I've read someone compare this to Jesus being on the cross, with Truman & Christoff paralleling with Jesus & God. I want to add to this and point out that the ""hidden camera"" is looking down on him, rather than how we look up at Jesus on the cross. So while there's that parallel, there's also a contrast because Truman isn't a powerful holy figure, he's just a guy.And that brings me to the character of Truman himself. The very very first scene, Christoff makes it clear that his goal of the show was to present true, candid emotion rather than acting. So for the past thirty years, Christoff and his God complex controlled every major event in Truman's life. But Truman's life was honestly pretty ordinary (besides the tv show part). He had a normal job, a normal house, a normal life - he was a normal guy. And the audience of the show was able to sympathize and empathize with him because of that.As Truman began seeing the cracks in his universe, he goes insane. He acts spontaneously and tries to escape Sea Haven, of course being interrupted every turn. Then he faced his biggest fear, the ocean, and sets out into the unknown. This was a very brave and inspiring sequence, as Truman determinedly didn't let anything stand in his way.Christoff announces himself to Truman as his ""Creator."" He gives Truman the option to stay in the safe world he created for him, or to step out in to the cruel world of reality. He chooses to leave, following his life long natural curiosity to a new chapter in life.I loved the ending, but so much was left in question. Did him & Sylvia meet? (I'm sure they got a happy ending.) How well does Truman adjust to the real world? What happens to Sea Haven? It's all left to interpretation. This kind of goes back to the religious parallels if you think about - Is there a god, like Christoff, dictating every single important event in our lives, or are we really in control of our own free will, like Truman?The supporting cast was great, but the literal star of the show here was Jim Carrey. We all know he's type casted as the funny or crazy guy, but that's because he's so good at it. There are several scenes in this film where he had the opportunity to use his comedic skills as Truman went absolutely bonkers, and those were fun scenes. But the reason why this film is considered such a Jim Carrey classic is because there were many dramatic, heartfelt moments where Carrey was able to show the emotional side of his character. This is a movie that shows how diverse Carrey is as an actor. I'll be sure to watch some of his other dramatic roles in the future.",The Truman Show

With the countless and awful remakes in today's world it's hard to find a movie that's original and unique today. I rarely watch new films since I think the older ones are better imo.I wouldn't consider myself a huge Jim Carrey fan, I like some of his movies, but not all of them. I had the honor of watching this great film several years ago in a college psychology class, and loved it. The basic idea of the film is that a man who believe what he is experiencing the real world, is in fact a staged TV show that has been going on for years and has no idea about it.The film itself is unique because to my knowledge nothing like this has been done before until EdTV, but that was different. The movie itself brings up an interesting point. Is everything that we do in life just part of some gran scheme and somebody is watching out lives. This film also has a quote that I would like to point out ""We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented."" This quote itself imo sums up the entire film. We don't question the reality that exists as we see it. We accept it, but how do we know it's real. How do we know it's not some person's dream and that once they wake up we die? We don't know that, nobody knows. We just accept it and deal with it. Truman doesn't question at first the world he is in. Little by little he questions the system and overall learns about his ""wolrd"" that he lives in.If you have not seen this film then I would strong suggest you watch it, especially those who have psychology background.",The Truman Show

Christof (Ed Harris), Trumans spiritual father and the creator of the show, said it´s not the show that is mad, it´s the real world outside that is mad - Truman lived in a save world where nothing could happen to him.  I could really feel Christof´s pain - when Truman leaves the show in the ending, it looked like a child that tries to grow up and wants to stand on his own feet, like a child that leaves his father.  Peter Weir, the director of ""Dead poets society"", amazes me ever and ever again. His movies are so uncommercial and ""un-american"" (he´s australian...), that it´s a miracle they´re mostly successful. But also Jim Carrey is a true gift.

Truman Burbank must have the illusion of complete freedom, but he can't have it. He must also have the delusions of privacy and the genuineness of all of those in on the 24-7-365 scam. If he ever figured it all out, he'd go insane from the absurdity of the situation.All is beautiful, and everything is a set-up... even his 'love interests' who must be in on the plot to delude him into thinking that there is but one accessible reality -- a world in which everything is a sham, if a pleasant one.

281,Supachewy,One of Peter Weir's Finest,9,6 September 2010,"The dramedy The Truman Show is directed by Peter Weir and stars Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, and Ed Harris. The film takes place in a modern day film set.The film starts off with a man named Christof (Harris) telling how he created a television series where a person's life is watched from beginning to end. This person is Truman Burbank (Carrey). Truman is a very nice person and he has no idea that his life is not normal and that he is actually on television. He is married to Meryl Burbank (Linney) who is an actress that is not really married to him. So basically Truman's whole life is scenarios set up by Christof for the entertainment of the world to watch. But soon Truman starts to realize things and believes that something is wrong...The screenplay is from Andrew Niccol and it is his second, his first being Gattaca. Niccol received an Oscar nomination for his writing and he does deserve it. The film is extremely original and is a true pleasure to watch. It is funny and full of drama, and I just couldn't wait to see how it ended. There are only a few minor problems with the screenplay and none of them made it not enjoyable. One of them was the fact that there were no strong anti slavery groups against the show because in a way Truman was a slave. Another is that there were some convenient slips of the tongue which made Truman more suspicious. Besides those though it was an excellent screenplay.The direction of this film was also quite good. Peter Weir as well earned an Oscar nomination, and yes he did earn it. He really knew how to get great performances out of his actors, every single one of them played their parts great. The shots in the film were excellent as well and I just felt so absorbed. I was rooting for Truman the whole time and it is hard to get a person to like a character that much. Overall very good direction.The acting in this film was superb. Jim Carrey gives a great performance as Truman and this is one of the few performances that Carrey has that is not a comedic role. He is great being so innocent and warm hearted. I just loved it whenever he said ""If I don't see you again later good afternoon, good evening, and good night"". Laura Linney was great as Truman's pretend wife. She acted like a not so great actress and it was really quite enjoyable to watch her try and make Truman believe that his world is real. One of my favorite parts of this film for me is when Truman is questioning her and she just starts saying how great cocoa beans are for an advertisement. She was just great. Ed Harris was the creator of the show, Christof, and he gave an excellent performance. He received an Oscar nomination for the intense creative mind and he deserved because while I was watching I could really feel how much he loved the world he created. And the last thing he wanted to happen was for Truman to destroy it.Overall I give this film a very strong 8/10.

It really amazes me to think that each and every moment in his life was a choreographed one except how he reacted to it. Jim Carrey is brilliant as always and everybody else did a great job also. But if they could have shown in detail how exactly did he found out about his life and thought to escape it would have been a cherry on top.

(Source: IMDB)The Truman show is a movie that you will enjoy from beginning to an end, the movie will break the boredom in a clever way that will seem to be simple and that's a thing that I have seen in very few movies.Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank was perfect, amazing performance and he was able to present that character exactly the way it should be presented, would not call this his best performance tho, in my opinion, Jim Carrey's best performance is ""Joel Barish"" in ""Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind"", that's why I don't agree with those who say ""The Truman Show"" is his best movie.
Ed Harris' performance was Oscar-worthy, and of course, the entire support cast was amazing, very well done.The Truman Show's amazing production design, music, and cinematography that looks exactly like a reality TV show, it's like you are thrown in there with Truman Burbank.The custom designs that were incredible and a thing that really grabbed my attention, for example, the cool black custom of Christof (played by Ed Harris) with the hat, or Lauren Garland's (played by Natascha McElhone) cool red custom with a shirt that has red flowers on it that she was wearing when her and Truman Burbank talked at the library, or Truman Burbank's suit, they were all so simple but looked amazing.The Truman show is a movie that everyone will enjoy and one of the most original movies ever made, it has drama, comedy, great score, character development, great story, superb production design, and many more things, highly recommend this to everyone.My rating is: 9/10",The Truman Show

290,thehappychuckler,"""Good morning, and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!""",9,13 May 2020,"Jim Carrey stars as Truman Burbank whose life is the subject of a crazy show people are eating up as entertainment. Everyone is aware of the show other than Truman himself. He's been on the show for over 10,000 days if you can believe it. Right from his birth. Truman though starts to figure some things out when there are some malfunctions like lights falling to the ground or seeing his dead father just to mention a couple things. Nothing is allowed to happen naturally in his life in his life like falling in love without major input from the show's creator and director Christof (really well played by Ed Harris as usual).A smart script from Andrew Niccol that is able to ask some good hard questions about humanity while giving a cold look at reality. Wonderfully directed by Peter Weir as well. Harris, Niccol and Weir all received Oscar nominations for their work. Now, I hardly ever feel this, but this film may work just as well if not better on TV due to the subject matter and really making you feel like you are watching the very show Jim Carrey is on.To me though the number # 1 reason why this film so amazingly well is Jim Carrey. He does not play that way over-the-top character who looks like he has drank 100 coffees that day. He is more down-to-earth, more human. Also starring Laura Linney as his wife Meryl as well as Paul Giamatti and Harry Shearer. So give it a watch if you like to think with a laugh. Highly recommended.",The Truman Show
291,EThompsonUMD,Great combination of social satire and philosophical allegory.,10,20 February 2005,"The Truman Show may be approached on one level as social satire exposing the emptiness of an American Dream defined by consumerism and purveyed by the electronic media over the last half century. Life in ""Seahaven,"" the vast dome-enclosed set/community in which Truman (Jim Carrey) has been raised under the watchful eyes of a worldwide TV audience of millions, is a sharp and elaborate parody of the corporate sponsored images of middle-class American material bliss and innocence first introduced to mass television audiences through such '50s sitcoms as Ozzie and Harriet, Father Knows Best, and The Donna Reed Show. A closely related target of The Truman Show's satire is the pervasive voyeurism and passivity that has increasingly characterized American social behavior as witnessed in film (ED TV), entertainment television (tell-all talk shows, Reality TV, the talent search genre), and even broadcast news (disaster/victim footage).Yet, on another level, The Truman Show, like Gattaca, The Matrix, Dark City and other more obvious examples of science fiction, deals with broad philosophical themes such as free will versus determinism in human action, subjective versus objective perceptions of reality, the assertion of humanness through existential rebellion, and the quest for an authentic self/ identity. Most immediately, the names and plot functions of the film's two principal characters - ""Christof,"" the megalomaniacal producer/director of a 24/7 reality TV show, and ""Truman,"" the show's eponymous everyman figure - invite the viewer to approach the work allegorically.Legally adopted by a corporation (in a clever parallel to virgin birth), manipulated by the all-seeing all-powerful Christof (Ed Harris) into phony friendship and empty marriage with actor-minions, and psychologically conditioned (i.e. terrorized) into fearing adventure and change, Truman gradually begins to suspect that Seahaven is not the paradise it purports to be. To assert his humanity and escape his artificially prolonged state of childlike ignorance, Truman must ultimately undertake that most mythic of journeys, a Sea Voyage. At its end, he must turn his back on the secure, controlled environment of his ""heavenly"" father's house and step through a forbidding black passageway that leads to the true human condition: emotional and physical risk, scary freedom, and - perhaps - real love. In so doing, Truman ironically brings to his TV audience (whether they are still capable of appreciating it or not) the very affirmation that the false god of television claims they receive from the contrived ""hope and uplift"" pabulum the show has been ladling out for 30 years along with its subliminal primary diet of product placement advertisement. In its climactic scenes, The Truman Show reveals Christof to be neither a social visionary nor a benevolent deity. Rather, we learn he has much in common with Orwell's Big Brother and - allegorically - with the implacable, sadistic god that Melville's Ahab imagines is running things behind the sky's impenetrable veil. By literally rending the heaven of his imprisoning universe, Truman navigates his storm-tossed sailing ship toward a completion of the heroic quest that Ahab's mad distraction (and Melville's theological uncertainty) forestalls: he momentarily frees himself and us from the diabolical/divine puller of the chains of human fate. In its final act, The Truman Show recasts the tragic despair of Moby Dick as comic triumph.",The Truman Show
292,dcoydcoy,Such A Great Movie!,9,15 January 2021,"Carrey is brilliant and Linney is brilliant! Laura does such a great job of playing a bad actress! Which makes her performance so good.
Like many, I've seen this film several times. Each time is almost as enjoyable as the first. The only flaw I find in the movie is the fact that once Christof tells Truman who he is (the star of a tv show), he should know the show can't possibly continue now that Truman knows the scam.

He trys to get out but fails he trys one more time to get out because in his teenage hold he find someone that he really loves and they took her way from him which is the fact he want to get out and find his true love that was the fact that made this movie really good not to bad not to stupid. I love the boat scene where he trys to get out which really good but and thats how movie should be. I know that some people disagree about this but I don't disagree about hating this movie.

The movie's premise was some years before the whole (And appalling by the way) Big Brother/Survivor phenomenon with a lot of taste and wit.Unlike many other films, The Truman Show manages to build a disturbing atmosphere, because you don't quite know what's coming next.

What the scriptwriters probably didn't know is that ""Reality TV"" is going to last until the present days and sprout into uncountable degenerate alterations. I guess ""The Truman Show"" was a form of social satire, an Orwellian vision of the future which will never come. Boy they were wrong. Watching Truman Burbank back in 1998. made me laugh, though these days it very much resembles all other TV surrounding.What does this mean for the movie? It's still brilliant. A rare and shiny gem in the sludge of Hollywood, as well as Jim Carrey's role of a lifetime. The film is great, but the fact our world is becoming more and more like ""The Truman Show"" is what scares me. Furthermore, people these days crave to have their privacy invaded, much unlike poor and oblivious Mr Burbank.If Truman knew back in 1998. what the world of Reality TV would look like now in 2012., I guess he would have tied a rope around his neck and jumped off that boat into the storm.",The Truman Show

Some of it is just crazy, but at least it keeps your attention pretty much all the way through, though I think it does get a little tiresome towards the end.  The movie is creative (though unrealistic), and has quite a few funny moments.  Definitely not my favorite movie--but it's unique. =)",The Truman Show
301,shattenjager777,A brilliant example of how subtlety works in film.,10,30 June 2003,"Peter Weir is a genius and this film is the best way to prove it.  ""Dead Poets Society"" was a better movie, but it had a better script to work with and better all around acting.  This film rests almost entirely on the shoulders of the more-than-capable Weir.Thinking about the positive points of this film, it looks like a can't miss: 1.  Andrew Niccol's mind providing an idea and a script, but his hands getting nowhere near the camera (he's just too heavy-handed as a director, see ""S1m0ne"" for proof), 2.  Jim Carrey in a dramatic role (the man can act, but he's not funny), and 3.  Peter Weir behind the camera but staying away from the script (""Green Card"" was okay, but it was a pretty generic script). How could you miss with that?  About the only way to improve upon that would be to bring in Kenneth Branagh, Robin Williams, and/or Kellie Martin.Perhaps the most easily overlooked aspect of this film is the brilliant performance of Laura Linney as Meryl.  Her performance is (purposely) more loaded with cheese than many pizzas that I have seen and in fact is the funniest part of the film (which, incidentally, is really a comedy more than a drama or a fantasy).  The cheese goes away only when she is truly disturbed by Truman's actions and asks, ""How can I be expected to carry on under these conditions?  It's just not professional!""  How's that for a bit of a subtle nudge at actors?However, the film is loaded with good performances, especially including that of Jim ""I need to quit trying to be funny"" Carrey and that of Ed Harris.  [THE NEXT TWO SENTENCES CONTAIN A SPOILER] The look on Harris's face after Truman walks out the door is one of the greatest facial expressions I have ever seen:  One can see in his face that he has lost, essentially, his son and that his child essentially chose to live in another world without him.  The power of that scene cannot be questioned.    Meanwhile, Carrey manages to make his loveably quirky, somewhat dull-witted character very believable throughout the film (though he does not have a scene that gives him the ability to create a look with the power of the aforementioned one by Harris).Yet, the film's power comes mostly from its direction.  Weir knows exactly what he is doing with the camera placement.  In fact, it is almost as though he has been planning this show in reality.  There is never a shot in Seahaven that seems impossible for a camera being used inside the set to portray, and the idea of using the television screens for the cameras in the homes of the average people is amazing.  He even consistently manages to bring out Christof's fatherly relationship to Truman in the scenes in Christof's studio (is that what you'd call it?) with the way Christof is almost always looking down at Truman and other small details like that. While Niccol's screenplay is certainly not bad, even a director like Steven Spielburg probably would have ruined this film.  It had to be Peter Weir and since it was, the film turned out brilliantly.",The Truman Show
302,suvopyne49,Truman Show - Every Episode is a gem,10,11 March 2011,"What a concept. /* Spoiler Alert*/ (The Concept is the USP of this movie, I don't wanna ruin the pleasure of watching this movie, so if you are planning to watch this movie, skip this paragraph)What will you do if you suddenly find out that the life you are leading is actually a planned life, and it's not planned by God or someone, it's planned by a TV-show creator. Also, the entire world have watched you since your birth. Your life is just another TV-show.That is the situation which Truman Burbank finds himself in, and tries to discover the world. Even the boat he uses to sail over the sea is metaphor, ""Santa Maria"" was the name of the ship in which Columbus discovers the world.Jim Carrey, the funnyman, is equally superb in both comedy and drama scenes.

303,carlo_simone18,An Outstanding Intellectual Film,10,7 January 2018,"The concept for this film alone is very intriguing but the way it is executed and how the themes that it presents are explored is quite brilliant.Truman slowly discovering that something quite odd is going on in the world he lives in (starting off with the studio light falling from the 'sky') and how he starts to lose his wit's end is a fascinating aspect to the film which Jim Carrey portrays very well. The themes of runaway celebrity culture and the fake nature of reality TV are subtly yet humorously traversed, particularly with the blatant product placement that is featured in the show. This is what makes this film so great, in how it integrates these thought-provoking ideas into the narrative.The artificial nature of Truman's life and how that is created is outstanding, such as how his eventual wife is chosen for him by the show's producers and how he is always subtly encouraged to never leave Seahaven so the show can continue to air. If certain cast members try to reveal to Truman what his life really is then they are swiftly whisked away, prompting the question of the morality of the decision to keep a man effectively in a prison away from the real world, with his entire life being a lie.The final scene in the film is a truly great piece of cinema with how the show's creator, Christof, tries to persuade Truman to not leave the set before Truman replies with his catchphrase ""If I don't see ya, Good afternoon, Good Evening and Goodnight"" before bowing and walking off. This is such a euphoric and emotionally-satisfying ending that is makes the film.In terms of performances I don't understand how Jim Carrey didn't get an Oscar nomination for his performance. It may be one of the greatest injustices of 90s Cinema. Ed Harris is also brilliant in the short amount of screen time he has as Christof, and deserved his Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.Overall, it's simply a great piece of 90s cinema.",The Truman Show

A wonder that Hollywood finally managed to create an intelligent, funny, emotional, esoterical, mysterious, philosophicalin short an all covering film that is really touching. In the first, somewhat overlong half the story is following the main hero Truman through his point of view and elaborating his quiet, normal life while the director Peter Weir is cleverly choosing strange camera angles to give the feeling as if he is being spy-ed by someone. In the second, and much more intriguing part, the story shifts to the outside"" world and to Christof's 10 mile wide studio from which Truman is being monitored by 5.000 cameras 24 hours a day for a TV show.--------------------- The themes of this sci-fi tragicomedy are quite fascinating existential ( finding out who we are and stopping anyone who wants to control our life ), philosophical ( what is real and what not? ) and even subversive ( the media changed the world so much that even a lie can pass as truth ). One of the best scenes is the one where Christof touches the sleeping Truman on the screen at night, creating a strange feeling how he is present in his life although he never met him!""The Truman Show"" deservedly won 3 Golden Globes for best score, main actor Jim Carrey and supporting actor Ed Harris, who was also nominated for an Oscar.Still, as much as I love it, I have to admit that the original shooting script by Andrew Niccol overshadows it. There we had a much more intimate storyline and original ideas. Some of the highlights there were that the location was New York (!), the scene where Truman accidentally discovers the word Trumanesque"" in the dictionary, the building of the fake town Sydney, Chloe's marching in into Christof's room and telling him that Truman didn't masturbate for 2 months, the dialog between a caller and Christof ( I enjoyed your work, Christof, but I can't say I saw all of it.""  Who can?"" ) or when Truman disguised himself while entering an xxx store all the while some two viewers had an ironic dialog ( What's with the disguise?""  Maybe he doesn't want to be recognized."" ). I can't understand why those scenes were deleted. True, the script ending is much weaker than the movie ending, but all in all it gives an better impression - and elaborates the plot more. It's sad because with that script this could have easily been even better.Grade: 9/10",The Truman Show

There has never been anything like it before! Jim Carrey is exceptional! Peter Weir, who did another movie on my top 3 list, Dead Poets Society, did a FANTASTIC job directing this story of paranoia! And of course, the script is brilliant. Jim Carrey should really be proud of himself for doing such a different role, and to star in a DRAMA-comedy. This movie is definitely on my top 3. That's funny, my top 3 movies all have something in common: Ethan Hawke is in Dead Poets Society and Gattaca, Gattaca was written by Andrew Niccol along with The Truman Show, and Peter Weir directed The Truman Show along with Dead Poets Society! (Note: I do not count the Star Wars movies on my top 3 list because I don't count those as movies, I count those as empire's.) I am very glad that this story had very little comedy elements in it.

Certainly it would be difficult for any movie to shine under those circumstances, but a better effort would've been nice. A simplistic plot that could've been explored fully in a Twilight Zone episode (and, I think, probably was). Intentionally bad acting by Burbank's ""supporting cast"" was off-putting, as was the logical inconsistency of the basic premise: that the dreary details of an excruciatingly boring life could be the source of endless fascination for millions of viewers.

This film has a lot of quiet charm, due not only to Jim Carrey's performance, but also to the subtle, serene way the story flows to it's conclusion.  ""The Truman Show"" isn't a big sprawling epic, with big characters and big events, but a simple movie about a man who is slowly discovering his life is a lie.  There's no real suspense, since the audience already knows the truth.  But, this is not a suspense movie, it is a satire of reality.

Face it, a lot of us see them as more ridiculous and counterfeit than reality. But, in the end, it is the entertainment value that continues to draw me. And, of course, how can I pass up Jim and Ed.",The Truman Show

316,jb-448,Alright,8,9 October 2007,I saw this movie for a film class at my high school. It was alright. The idea of The Truman Show is essentially that a television producer called Christof (Ed Harris) has created a fake world for Truman (Jim Carrey). In this fake island called Seahaven Truman has a wife (Laura Linney) friends and a job. Trumans life is a hit TV show broadcast all over the world with Truman not even knowing. But certain things reveal the truth and Truman deceiving the 5000 cameras and all of the crew and cast sets off on a boat (He's afraid of water since his dad mysteriously died in an accident. In reality it was fake). He reaches the end of the island and crashes into the edge of the set. He finds the exit door but Christof tries to stop him. Truman bows and leaves his phony world for ever....,The Truman Show

He wakes up and goes to a normal job, kissing his normal wife goodbye, and greeting all of the normal people in his normal little town. However, I cannot say that ""The Truman Show"" is normal. Far from it. It is the originality and uniqueness of this film that makes it so memorable. One day, after years of this ordinary life, he decides he wants to take action and actually gain experiences. To have an adventure or two. The problem is, that as much as he tries, everything is getting in his way. That is when he becomes suspicious about why the world seems to be revolving around his life. All of this pointing to the fact that he is being watched around the clock by the entire world. This is one of those movies that sticks with you long after the credits.

318,JoshuaMLosapio,A Beautiful Tribute to the Universal Desire for Freedom,9,4 September 2019,"""The Truman Show"" is a moving, beautiful movie that never gets old. Almost everything about it is absorbing, multi-layered, and ultimately inspiring in a way that few movies are. Director Peter Weir uses powerful imagery and riveting performances to tell a timeless story about humankind's unending quest for freedom, with Truman (a ""true man"") at the center. I love the film's story, which uses its ingenious premise to critique a global culture increasingly dominated by celebrity obsession and ""reality"" TV. In a ""post-truth"" environment where the leader of the free world is a former reality TV star, ""The Truman Show"" couldn't be more relevant. The finale is easily one of the best ever in cinema history and Ed Harris' performance is perhaps the finest of his career - the fact that he didn't win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor astounds me.I want to give ""The Truman Show"" a perfect 10/10, but I can't due to the movie's narrative problems. The logic of the film's world (the explanation for how Truman was ""adopted"" by the studio or why Truman never discovered his whole life was a show until his 30s) isn't laid out until the movie's third act, making the central premise hard to believe for most of the film. A basic rule of screenwriting is you're supposed to establish the setting at the beginning, not the end. Of course the movie's premise is so good that I mostly ignore this problem while I watch it, but I'm still left wondering why the State of California allowed a corporation to adopt a child or hold a man against his will - questions the movie never answers. I'm usually willing to overlook plot holes if they don't hurt the overall viewing experience, but even after watching ""The Truman Show"" multiple times I have a hard time finding the central premise believable. I know it's fiction, but even ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" operate within the suspension of disbelief.""The Truman Show"" isn't flawless. But so what? Movies don't have to be. Like people we enjoy them despite not being 100% perfect because of the way they make us feel and better appreciate the experience of being human. ""The Truman Show"" inspires me every time I watch it and I can't wait to see it again. 9/10.",The Truman Show

321,Alex_Kladis,Quick Review,9,17 September 2018,"""The Truman Show"" is a unique film about the television obsession (or - as a true allegory - any kind of obsession) and the limits that people seem to leave behind when they're talking much about profit. Human dignity, law, any type of principals are pretty much dead during the first half of the film. Alongside Truman of course, the movie make you realise all the above and highlights the unfairness of the case.The Picture's end where the two guards just change channel after just a second of the end of a 30-years-program, seems to only give more emphasis to the moral of the whole film!""The Truman Show"" is a masterpiece and a MUST watch with friends or family!",The Truman Show

It hasn't lost anything as time has passed.I recall watching Hitchcock's Vertigo with a movie audience several years ago and when Jimmy Stewart explains to Kim Novak how he wants her to dress and wear her hair he ends with this justification, ""It can't possibly matter to you!"" The entire audience burst out laughing.This movie is as fresh and modern as it was in 1999 (not as old as Vertigo, I know). I love the reactions of those watching the show - how invested they are and how much they all love Truman. And Jim Carey is wonderful. Ed Harris, too, as Christoph (a reference to Christo, perhaps? There is a line about an umbrella, picked up in a windstorm, injuring someone) is brilliant, too.",The Truman Show
324,two-rivers,Truman: A True Human Representative,9,10 January 2003,"Of course you could do the same as most other people do: describe this movie as `a satirical and sometimes hilarious comment on the role of the modern media'  or something of the kind. But you would do `The Truman Show' wrong if you left it like this, it contains many more truths than just that.There are two opposing concepts of life which stand out. One is firmly anchored in the shores of Protection, it means that you do not feel any inclination to venture out into the unknown, for you are happy where you are, and by no means you want to alter the present state of things. For such people the town called `Seahaven' would be the ideal one: it is a haven against the dangerous outside world, here represented by the sea, a place where you can feel absolutely safe.But Man, throughout his history, has always shown his discontent with staying at home and just maintaining the knowledge passed on to him by his ancestors. He has always felt a desperate craving for new experience. Explorers like Magellan, who was the first man to surround the Earth, stand for such endeavouring energies. Truman Burbank, although his position as a life insurance salesman might let you presume the exact opposite, is a would-be explorer himself and worships men like Magellan. When he tells his friend Marlon that he wants to leave his secure `desk job' and go to Fiji he also mentions that `there are still islands in Fiji where no human being has ever set foot.' His aim is to see something of the unknown world, add new dimensions to his life.But Truman's plan is counteracted by the requirements of the show in which he is the unsuspecting hero. By no means is he allowed to become aware of his true condition. Therefore all his attempts to leave Seahaven must inevitably fail. It is as if his life is guided by invisible strings, held together by the godlike Christof. It is only by a superhuman effort that he manages to set himself free, surmounting the fear of the element that he dreads most: water. By undertaking an unlikely escape voyage across the ocean that strikes the TV-program bosses by surprise he finally gets to the boundaries of the world that meant reality to him.Now he has finally achieved what he always wanted: to find the exit door of Seahaven. And there is nobody who can stop him. He resists the entreaties of his `creator', Christof, and boldly advances into the land beyond the `iron curtain'.Of course, we might be tempted to regard this scene as a metaphor for the passing of the ultimate threshold of human existence: from the land of the living to the land of the dead. That view seems coherent, but only if you exclude death as the end of the line. For what Truman has in mind is clearly continuity. He is carrying the identikit picture of Sylvia (the woman he once lost and always hoped to find in Fiji) and refers to it as his `map'. Thus his innate discoverer's energy is enhanced by the power of love. And it is this explosive combination that finally smoothes the way for his escape from the protected slavery into the realm of infinite freedom.",The Truman Show
325,johnfos,"""We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented"" -- Christof",9,19 June 2005,"There's an old Doors song that has the chorus line ""break on through to the other side"", and it comes to mind as I write. There are many movies now that begin by showing us an everyday, mundane, version of our world and then have the central character ""breaking through"" to something much more meaningful and significant.Probably The Matrix is the best example of such a movie, where a computer message implores Neo to ""Wake Up!"" and begin a journey that has him uncovering an alternate reality. And then there is Groundhog Day where a nice cosy small town visit leads Phil Connors to move beyond the selfishness that has trapped him, to being a more expansive and loving human being. Even Star Wars has a dual reality theme, with a deeper reality being evident in scenes with The Force; the light sabre scenes with Darth Vader, in particular, are fights between spiritual warriors, not ordinary beings.And then we come to the Truman show, where wide-eyed Truman (True Man) Burbank (Jim Carrey) begins to suspect that his calm and routine everyday existence in the town of Seahaven has another side to it. Nothing is quite what it seems. It's as if Truman is in a prison and gradually he pieces together the jigsaw puzzle of his entrapment, faces his fear (of water), and literally opens the door to another world.The Truman Show is yet another example of a movie that can be enjoyed at two levels: a popular film from Hollywood as well as a spiritual allegory that raises fundamental questions about our lives. What could have been an ordinary film is lifted up by an intelligent script as well as good acting and directing. It's a movie that is well worth seeing more than once.",The Truman Show

327,Degree7,"""How's it going to end?"" ""I was wondering that myself.""",8,11 November 2013,"I have heard of the Truman Show to be regarded as a 'reference point' movie, where the general outline of the story is so outrageous and unique (to a point), that everyone knows the film through the phrase ""oh, that's the one where the guy is trapped in, so and so...."". Not every film is as instantly recognizable as The Matrix or Star Wars, but their set-ups are crucial to the intrigue. As with Groundhog Day, the Truman Show may just be one of the greatest and most intelligent comedies of the 1990s.Some may find the satire here too heavy handed, thus making it shallow. But the pertinent themes of self-determination, the relationship of institutions like the State, Media, and religion in tandem with the idea of free will, and the concept of what it truly means to be a happy person are all explored for better or worse here. Some of the imagery is a little too obvious, like Truman literally piercing through 'the edge of the world' and having a conversation with 'God'. The natural source of comedy in Truman slowly realizing his world is a TV set is woefully underused, with only about a third of the screen time dedicated to Jim Carrey's priceless antics among the straight faced actors and television crew around him. The film remorselessly lampoons network television with views inside the control room. A perfectly cast Ed Harris as a maniacal parody of a Steve Jobs entrepreneur/artiste, complete with beret and turtleneck sweater, anchors the story as the plausibly divine instrument of Truman's fate. The use of product placement invading the character's life is another stroke of genius.The film ends somewhat abruptly, but the tale of a single human life being born out of and fighting against the ratings is something to aspire to, ironically. The metaphor couldn't be more appropriate in this day and age of increasing surveillance and invasion of privacy.

332,felixmartinsson,Nostalgic,8,25 August 2017,"I remember watching this film when I was younger not understanding anything until the end of the film when he crashed the boat into the wall. Now I got a whole different story and I loved it even more than the first time. Truman is a man who has been imprisoned without knowing it for many years, and is the biggest star of the outer world. People have followed his life since the his birth to this day. It starts off with Truman clueless of what is going on, but the fake world around him is starting to catch up with him, and he suspects something isn't right. And when he meets a girl in the library she lets the secret out. She takes him to the beach to let him know everything, but its not long before the actors are called in to save the show. This time a man playing a dad to the girl, who saves everything by saying she is mentally ill and drives her away. Truman is left with nothing but questions and an ambiguous mind. He's doubting everything, questioning everything, and starts to think he is going insane. The director of the show is well prepared and got everything figured out to keep Truman in the pretend world that The Truman Show is reliant on. The smartest move of them all, was probably making him and his dad go sailing, killing the dad by creating a storm, and drown the dad. And that would sooner lead to a phobia of water, very clever since the town is surrounded by water, which would make Truman stay there forever. The hidden subjects about, The higher power/god, ownership of our own life and Ethics was in the back of my mind throughout the whole film. It would be unethical to keep someone imprisoned like that, not only that but to share his life with the whole world, showing no respect or giving Truman privacy. The idea of the story that the film is built upon is truly phenomenal, so intriguing. I can't imagine what I would have done if I found out I was the star of a show like ""The Truman Show"".",The Truman Show
333,jaysilentbob37,"Jim Carrey's best, and one of my favorites ever.",10,20 July 2006,"An amazing premise that constantly kept me on the edge of my seat (not in a suspense/ thriller way) was perfect to make the first dramatic Jim Carrey movie I ever saw one of the best movies of all time, and proved more enjoyable than many (if not all) of his comedies. Have an open mind while watching this. While the film is easily a drama, it is actually quite funny. Watch it expecting a comedy, and you'll hate it. Watch it expecting a thought- provoking drama, and you'll find it to be just that, and you'll often laugh out loud.Everyone is familiar with the story somehow. Truman (Jim Carrey) is an ordinary man, living in a town, Seahaven Island, that defines the term ""too perfect to be true,"" and he has never left it. What he doesn't realize is that the town is actually built inside a giant TV studio, and over 5000 cameras are placed within the town, broadcasting Truman's entire life as an iconic, wildly popular TV show, that plays 24/7, and is controlled by a producer known as Christof (Ed Harris). Truman has never known that he is the most famous man alive, as every telltale sign that might reveal it is cleverly covered up by the controllers, and every one of Truman's friends and ""family"" are just actors who probably have no true compassion for Truman. The movie follows the show up until Truman's eventual discovery of his situation, and his attempts to escape.One fun thing to do after you watch this film is to watch Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. This is a great way to see just how talented Jim Carrey is. He was robbed at the Oscars this year, as his performance was dead on. While he plays it straight, there is the occasional glimpse of his style of comedy, especially in a rather intense scene where he gives his ""wife"" several hints that he knows about his fake world. His behavior in that scene will provide some relief for people who were expecting a Jim Carrey laugh-fest. One thing that makes his performance in the movie better than the rest is that Jim Carrey is the only one playing a real person. Every line said by anyone else around him (besides the controllers) is staged. Everyone besides Jim are playing actors. That isn't saying that everyone else is bad. Everyone else is terrific. Truman's wife (Laura Linney) is the second best performance. She is a brilliant actress playing a suspiciously bad actress. You have to see it to believe it.In spite of all the drama, the movie is actually (subtly) hilarious. Sight gags (all related to the plot) are frequently visible, as is the behavior of everyone around Truman when they get suspicious that he knows his world is fake. Truman's wife constantly describes household products to Truman as if she were a rejected audition for a badly written commercial. Truman doesn't seem to notice this (yet). Travel agencies are filled with posters warning people of the deadly hazards of flying on an airplane. The fact that these type of sight gags are rarely acknowledged is one source of humor. Also, the thought of what's going through the actor's heads as Truman approaches them with travel plans are rather funny. The best sequence of the movie is a talk show interview with Christof, which gives us a behind the scenes look at the show, and answers many of the biggest questions we may have about the technical details of Truman's life.The combination of humor with the drama of the amazing story ultimately leaves the viewer with a lifted spirit, and looking at the world a whole new way. I recommend this thought- provoking, moving, entertaining, and arguably hilarious film to everybody and give it a 10/10.It is rated PG for Thematic Elements and Mild Language.

336,mhoney-1,Quite possibly the most intelligent allegory ever put on screen,10,16 April 2003,"This is a perfect film. Andrew Niccol, a genius of frightening allegories(Gattacca, S1mone) created a brilliant story of a reality TV show(before we HAD reality TV shows) created by a demented genius known only as Christof(Ed Harris) about the life of Truman Burbank(Jim Carrey, in what is his first and best dramatic role--I can't believe he wasn't nominated!) who lives the American Dream in a picture-perfect island town. From the start, as you see that everyone he meets(or is supposed to meet) is an actor, and people are glued to the TV 24-7 to watch his life unfold. The movie is a frightening tale of manipulation, reality, environment, and a number of other things that haven't come to mind yet. Laura Linney, as Truman's ""nurse"" wife Meryl is hilarious when she picks up an object and speaks to the camera, advertising the item to the audience while Truman just watches, a little bewildered by her enthusiasm. Noah Emerich as Truman's beer-guzzling best friend comes up with some subtle yet humorous lines: ""You've got a DESK job! I'd kill for a desk job."" Natascha McElhone also shines as the girl who stole his heart, exposed him to the truth, and now is part of a minority of people protesting to free Truman. As Truman's suspicions arise about his life we feel with Truman, we become just as intrigued by his adventures as the people watching him on TV, and perhaps more compasionately. Ed Harris adds subtle charm to his character as a man who admires his art so much, and takes it so seriously, that he has come to forget that he's not God, and that Truman is a person just like everybody else. As long as he can keep him afraid of the water, Truman is a prisoner, never going to Fiji.",The Truman Show
337,panchodh_12,Life is a Creation,8,20 May 2016,"From the moment we are old enough to grab a marker with our small fingers, we toy with the idea of creating our own world within this one. Artists are simply the lucky ones who manage to grow up while retaining the possibility of making a living out of the creative act. But the idea of playing God is inherent to all of us, so much that the idea that we are simply part of a bigger creation is deeply ingrained within our cultural genoma.The Truman Show takes this to the ultimate end: the possibility of creating an entire world from scratch, the possibility of playing with someone's life and control it in every single extent. It is noteworthy how such an experiments ends up looking an awful lot like George Orwell's 1984. In the end, God might not be much more than just a (benevolent?) totalitarian dictator.The resemblance to Plato's allegory of the Cave is quite clear. And as such, it is not hard to figure out what will happen once Truman begins to notice that his everyday life is simply shadows cast on the wall of the cave. No matter how much the Creator tries to distract him, the idea is already incepted in his brain: he will try to leave the cave.But the notion that the outer world, outside the cave, is our own world, is somewhat disturbing. One tends to think of Plato's allegory of the cave as a quest for the Utopian, but if the world outside the cave is our own, dirty and imperfect world, wouldn't it make more sense to remain in the cave? Confronting ourselves with the real world will render all quest for the Ideal futile. No wonder the existentialist had such a hard time once they denied the existence of God. The only thing left to do, then, is to turn the allegory of the cave upside down: if the outer world is so imperfect, we might look for perfection within our own, personal caves (which is what Creators do).The Truman Show is a very engaging movie, that tricks us with its looks of yet another Jim Carrey blockbuster, only to have us trapped into a thought-provoking experience that will keep us awake at night. It is a turning point in Carrey's career, in which he proves that laughs is not the only thing he can provoke in the viewers.

As was the casethen, here again he tackles a very important and relevant issue inmodern society, and poses quite a few important questions.

This is one of the most original and best screenplays I've had the pleasure of watching! I have hard time describing this movie. Its not exactly a dram or a true comedy, but the feel has a little of both. There is a uniqueness to The Truman Show that everyone should enjoy. Peter Weir took the topic of the media and made his point without feeling forced. Weir's style fit perfectly with this kind story. I don't understand how Jim Carey and Ed Harris didn't get more for their performances. Jim Carrey has been in plenty of over the top, slapstick roles, but this is not one of them. His humor came out subtly and perfectly. This is by far his best performance. Harris was also fantastic and played his villainous role well. How didn't these two get recognized back then?The Truman Show is a phenomenal and extremely under-appreciated. No way around that. There is a fantastic story and meaning behind this, and it was presented perfectly. 9/10.",The Truman Show
344,d-snake1,"If you want something light and silly, go watch something else by Carrey.",9,7 May 2018,"On the surface, The Truman Show is about a man who has lived his life trapped inside of a bubble. He tries the entire movie to pop the bubble, and he eventually does.Under that layer, though, is a complex theme. Does Truman really enjoy his cell? He seemed to for years. At the same time, he struggled with memories, but don't we all? As the viewer, we're left to determine the morality of the happiness of millions versus the freedom of one. We're also left to consider whether Truman's cage was better than his freedom. A child born into a system that doesn't have a great track record or a life of relative safety with no knowledge of the cage. The viewer also has to determine the sturdy nature of reality. What is reality besides our perception of it? What's real to Jim or to Bob? Are the things that are real to them real to me if I've never seen or heard about them? Beyond the philosophical questions the movie poses, the film itself is solid. Jim Carrey pulls off the part wonderfully. He's more than just a comedian, although he can bring the humor the instant the scene needs it. The supporting cast fell right in line. The pacing may be a little slow early on for many viewers, but that is remedied once the action begins to pick up.",The Truman Show

His birth, his growth, his joys, his sorrows, and, if nothing else, his death, will all be played out on a rigged and choreographed stage, watched by countless men and women in the glamorous modern world. They are an integral part of Truman, and they are growing up together. Without Truman, their lives will be unsustainable, the world will be in chaos, and life will be meaningless.But an unprecedented reality show, designed to last for three decades, has been crushed by Truman's suspicions and quest. After being tested by artificial storms, thunderstorms, and waves, the ship carrying him to the truth ruthlessly crashes through the dazzling blue beauty of the false sky. In that moment, a myth ended and a conspiracy was put into the light. More importantly, the deep impact proved that as long as human nature existed, the mind could not be manipulated forever.However, Truman does not belong to the Truman world alone.

348,criti-cally,"This is not a movie, it is a idea that gets implanted in your mind, and changes the way you think and look at life.",9,3 June 2020,"The Truman Show is not a film. It is an idea. It's this small idea that is injected into the mind of the audiences through a mixture of lights and celluloid. This is one those ideas, which can make a man lose sleep, and his mind churning for weeks. Its one of those ideas that can inspire even more ideas or destroy existing ones. It can manifest itself into a reality, or make us realize it was there all along and we just never saw it. It brings up front what we think is normal, and makes us question why is it normal. It is an idea that gets implanted in your mind, and you can never get it out. Once you watch this movie, a part of it will always stay with you.""You accept the world you're given"", the filmmakers suggest; more thoughtful viewers will get the buried message, which is that we accept almost everything in our lives without examining it very closely. When was the last time you reflected on how really odd a tree looks? Are we doing what we actually want to do, or are we just performing what system dictates, or what everyone else is doing? Do we ever get to break free from this cycle of pleasing everyone to be able to actually work on pleasing just one person, that is our-self? Like I said, many ideas and question can grow out from this one little seed of an idea planted in this movie.
The movie is about a common ordinary, upbeat man, Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey). However, unbeknown to him, he is the star of the most popular show in the history of television. For 10,909 days, it has been on the air, using 5000 cameras to show every moment in every day of the life of one man.
The public loves it -- there are Truman addicts who go to sleep with the TV on and who have sets installed in the bathroom so they don't miss anything when they're taking a bath. Every individual in ""The Truman Show"" is an actor with one important exception: the lead character himself. For, while everyone around Truman is playing a part, he is cheerfully ignorant about the truth. He thinks this is all real, and his obliviousness to the situation gives the program its core appeal -- that there's nothing counterfeit about Truman.Truman works as a sales executive at an insurance company, is happily married to Meryl (Laura Linney), and doesn't find it suspicious that she describes household products in the language of TV commercials. He is happy, in a way, but an uneasiness gnaws away at him. Something is missing, and he thinks perhaps he might find it in Fiji, where Lauren (Natascha McElhone), the only woman he really loved, allegedly has moved with her family.Truman's world is controlled by a TV producer named Christof (Ed Harris), whose control room is high in the artificial dome that provides the sky and horizon of Seahaven. He discusses his programming on talk shows, and dismisses the protests of those (including Sylvia) who believe Truman is the victim of a cruel deception.The movie's story follows Truman's journey in finally discovering and realizing his life is an elaborately constructed ruse and escaping it.
The story is unique, thrilling, well presented and very close to reality. It's like watching an episode of Black Mirror. In fact, I see the episode White Bear from the Season 1 of Black Mirror drawing references from The Truman Show directly. In The Truman Show, Ed Harris is playing this pivotal role of Christoff the director of the show, who rules over Seaside with a sinister, God-Like-Authority, that amounts to the film's most satirical aspect, since it so easily links divinity with hip, media-savvy grandiosity.
He created the character Truman for everyone, and through him he controls his audience. He manipulates his audience into buying the products he choses, he has them emotionally vested into this characters lives, and he can induce in them thoughts and judgement of other people. White Bear was like a modernized version of The Truman Show, replacing Truman with an animated character. It picks up on the theme presented in The Truman Show and expands it further. What if Truman kept on growing and didn't realize where he was trapped? Wouldn't Christof be able to manipulate people's thoughts on the political front? Would one day it won't be Christof running this but actual government agencies, knowing how powerful the character and the show has become? And that is just what White Bear does! It expands the idea originally presented in The Truman Show.Black Mirror isn't the only show to have expanded on the Truman idea. If we look at it, even The Matrix Trilogy is also based on the similar theme of, ""What if the world we are living in, is not real, but a simulated one."" If The Matrix was stripped of it's technicalities about breaking the system, fast action sequences, neo-noir look and hi-tech sci-fi and replace it with media, colors, comedy, drama and an ordinary man and his ordinary life, you'll get the inspiration source of The Matrix, which is The Truman Show.
As the story unfolds, however, we're not simply expected to follow it: We're invited to think about the implications. About a world in which modern communications make celebrity possible, and inhuman.One of the ideas presented is that the media in some way or the other does control your life, and one doesn't really have the free will that they think they do because everything is influenced! It so resonated with me, that tragic nature of it.Remember this movie was released in 1998, and at the time, reality was negligible or none actually. It was a year after this show that Big Brother started to air. Reality TV, I feel, was one of those ideated predictions made by this movie that actually came true.
By Reality TV I simply mean what is meant by the word, ""Real lives of people or unscripted actions and dialogues displayed on TV, and following their lives or a quest"". Truman simply lives, and the show's popularity is its straightforward voyeurism. And, like Big Brother, Survivor, and every other reality show on the air, none of his environment is actually real. While I feel the current reality TV is still more acting and just a part of the lives of its characters, it can eventually maybe change to something of the Truman sorts, in a horrifying Black Mirror kind of experiment. The Truman Show is all the more noteworthy for its remarkably prescient vision of runaway celebrity culture and a nation with an insatiable thirst for the private details of ordinary lives.But there is a part of me, that also believes that the story while it introduces the concept of reality TV, it also signifies the falseness of the Reality TV that currently exits. When you know there is a camera, there is no reality. In that respect, Truman Burbank ""is the only genuine reality star.""
But on another level, I also feel that as an audience, we just blew past The Truman Show's cautionary subtext even more; we've elected a reality star as our president!Going above the reality TV aspect, I personally feel Truman show is actually about the Power of Media and its control on us. Truman's life inspires audiences around the world, meaning their lives are controlled by his. In the end, the power of the media is affirmed rather than challenged. These films and television programs co-opt our enchantment (and disenchantment) with the media and sell it back to us.Our world and its people want new things that connect us to reality using our technology more and more. With the advent of social media, this is proof enough of how the power of media over us has evolved even 100 times more.
Those of us without official series are essentially starring in and producing our own reality shows, via constant Twitter updates, Instagram Stories, Snapchats, Facebook videos, and YouTube videos. When I sit in a car or in a van or a room, and I see 90 percent of the people with their faces glowing and their eyes in the palm of their hand, I go, 'This is Orwellian.' Their consciousness has been reduced to what other people think, period.In addition to forecasting the power of media, the film also predicts the scope of modern product placement (as presented by Linney's impeccably named character, Meryl Burbank, who plays the role of Truman's wife on the show), privacy invasion, and the existential quandary of whether to live for yourself or an audience-be it television or social media. Truman must ultimately decide between accepting the artificial world he knows, or venturing into the unknown in pursuit of truth.The underlying ideas made the movie more than just entertainment. It brings into focus the new values that technology is forcing on humanity. By and large the film is extremely witty in its ways of blowing the television show's cover. Early on, Truman is puzzled by a piece of lighting equipment that falls from the sky. Later, he is sprinkled by his own little rainstorm. And when Truman moves, the stage rainstorm moves, too.
Andrew Niccol came up with the idea of writing this script from an episode of The Twilight Hour. But the original version he wrote was very dark, set in New-York and was a more serious and sci-fi. It didn't resonate with Peter Weir, the director. It was Peter Weir who loved the script when he read it, but questioned, ""Why would the audience of the show be glued to it, watching it 24X7, if the show was that dark?"". This kind of makes sense as we are shown in the movie that some audiences are falling asleep right in front their TV sets, or even watching in the bathtub. Why would someone want to watch this series if it was so depressing? So with this thought and Peter's guidance, Niccol changed the script, making it more lighter, colorful and more easy to connect to the audience. For this, he did have to re-write it 12 times!Peter Weir thought a lot about the back story, as he believed if he isn't convinced by the idea, how will the movies audience be convinced? He even created a look book, with cut outs of images from a 1940s sears catalogue to get an idea of how",The Truman Show
349,tim_dearing-1,Unexpectedly stunning,10,20 March 2009,"I'm embarrassed to admit that I missed this film first time around.Finding it in the cheap bin at the local supermarket, I decided to give it a try.Wow. For those who believe that Jim Carrey is a slapstick actor, with only the ability to play goofy, low brow comedic parts, then watch this film. His performance is extraordinary. It's difficult to keep the lump from your throat in the last moments of the film.Ed Harris, always a great performer gives a perfect role as the arrogant controller of the TV show that is Trumans (Carreys) life. Other supporting roles are equally well acted.But it is Carrey who gives a stunning performance, this is no mere walk through of a man out of his depth, it is nothing short of an Oscar wining performance, and that it was completely overlooked just goes to show what a mockery the Oscars can be.The film is thought provoking and humorous, tension building and provocative, in fact everything a great film should be.

350,hankhanks12345,Brilliant. One of the most interesting films of the last 10 years,10,22 April 2007,"""The Truman Show"" is a rarity in Hollywood - or movies in general - a film that actually makes the audience think, and is about ideas. How do we know what we see is real? Why do we accept what is around us without questioning it? What would happen if we found out that a fundamental we were making about the world turned out to be completely wrong? You'd think a movie that was about those things would be a chore to get through, but in fact ""The Truman Show"" is great fun. I certainly wouldn't call it a comedy (although there are a few light moments here and there), but it's not too heavy and goes down easy.It might sound like exaggeration, but the scene where Truman first starts to realize what's going on is one of the best scenes I've seen in any movie, because of Carrey's acting, the direction, and also because of the Philip Glass soundtrack (which was critical to making that scene work).If you haven't seen The Truman Show, do yourself a favor and check it out.",The Truman Show
351,leandros,a voyeuristic classic,9,17 October 1998,"Many thanks to Peter Weir for winning us a surprisingly talented actor, Jim Carrey. This dark comedy-drama with its beautifully and precisely webbed plot, cinematography and string of ideas is definitely deserving many academy awards, but will not get them. I was overwhelmed (and scared) by everything the director superbly presents us what we already know, and enjoyed every moment of being the voyeur (and when I got out of the theater, the voyee). The soundtrack is definitely worth buying, and the movie itself is worth seeing for a second time. But the trailers, thanks to the well-praised (!) media I think spoil the surprising and spooky feel. Ed Harris steals many scenes even from the superb Jim Carrey. A must see for the media-aware crowd.",The Truman Show
352,Artêmis,Jim Carrey in a drama! And it's good!,9,14 October 1999,"The Truman Show is one of my favorite movies. Before watching it I wasn't very excited even expecting a great film. In fact, I decided to watch it when I realized that all magazines were saying it was incredible, beautiful, touching, ... And I really found it!I thought the movie was more comedy than drama. It's a multi-genre movie, it's very hard to tell. I loved the scenes where they showed  how Truman's life could be (and were) controlled. One spotlight falling from the sky, all the days were sunny, the same people doing the same thing every day, and the most amazing, when Christof (Ed Harris), trying to find Truman, makes the sun rise in 2 seconds at midnight. I have to say that I was a bit afraid of Jim Carrey. How can a movie with Jim Carrey as the main character be a drama or even be good? But this time his grimaces didn't affect the movie. As nothing is perfect in the world, there are some small ""problems"" in The Truman Show. I think the theme could be more explored by the director Peter Weir. The end, that some people said was revolting, didn't look so strange to me but I agree that they should have shown what happened to Truman after his decision. OK, Truman is free. And after it? In summary, you must see this movie. It's almost perfect. 9/10",The Truman Show

It is so multi-layered that you can spend hours and hours discussing and dissecting it and still you may just have missed one important aspect of it.On the surface it is a story of Truman a 30 something guy who realizes one day that his whole life has been actually a TV show. Everybody around him, including his wife and best friend, are mere actors and everything around him is a studio set. Bizarre concept but not so bizarre if you think about all the reality shows these days. The movie is kind of prophetic because it came out before the reality shows had not yet flooded our cable. One can also interpret the movie from the way media creates, manipulates and destroys personalities these days.Jim Carey has given an excellent performance but it is sad that it went unnoticed by the academy. But they can't be blamed because he has become a prisoner of his own image so much so that no one takes him seriously. Had it been Tom Hanks instead of him I am sure this movie would have made a clean sweep that year.One of the most relevant movies of our times.",The Truman Show
355,alishahmohd,"Ambitious and a great thought provoking film, which is a great combination of social satire and philosophy.",9,14 July 2014,"The Truman Show is a fantastic film, it is about a man whose entire life is a TV show, he has been monitored and been on since the day he was born all the way to his mid thirties. Although he is not aware of this fact all the people around him, his family, his relatives, neighbors and friends are all actors hired by the TV show also to monitor him.The film starts out pretty basic and simple, you wouldn't think anything extraordinary is happening, you will just be seeing an average man going about his daily routine, things keep on going pretty basic until an unforeseen event unfolds in his life, and he becomes confused about what is going on. Some of Truman's actions do not make sense early on as well, tearing the pictures of girls from magazines. Soon after some events Truman finds out something is wrong and there are people following him and monitoring his moments, and soon after the twist is revealed in it's full form, that Truman is in a TV show only he is not aware of it and everyone he knows in that town is a hired actor and the city he lives in is also a film set.This was a wonderful plot twist which not only makes the film so much more interesting and makes you want to re-watch the whole film again, from a different perspective, and closely watch the early scenes and listen to the dialog carefully and see how the actors are behaving around Truman. The ending was also great because it leaves it up to interpretation if Truman will be able to survive in the world out there when he has spent his entire life on the film set, the ending is not something i would call a HAPPY ENDING because it leaves it up to interpretation about Truman's future. Performance wise this film is great, anyone who says Jim Carrey cannot do drama roles should watch this, he plays Truman at his very best, although he does bring humor to some of his scenes he is mostly playing a dramatic character and his antics, dialog delivery is all done well. Ed Harris did not get that much screen time but he played Christof spot on, he was perfect in playing a man who would go as far as he can to make his TV show a success and make sure Truman never leaves. The rest of the actors on the Truman Show did well they were all playing two roles, one of the actors in a TV shows and their characters in the TV show and it was well executed. The direction is also fantastic there are camera which focus closely on Truman with the screen having a background which is the film's way of showing that Truman is on camera and is being watched by people around the world. The other camera angle is the one we see from out perspective. The setting is also done well, the whole island has been designed well to look like a TV set.The music is also good, as it suits most of the scenes the film is in, the music that plays in the intro and the conclusion when Truman is talking to Christof specially suits those scenes perfectly. The only minor issue with Truman Show would be it's slow pacing and slow start and slow development at least during your first watch, by the time the major event start to unfold and the film starts to get interesting and reveal the big twists, you may be kind of bored and may have grown restless. You may want to watch it a second time from a different perspective knowing clearly from the start that Truman is being directed the entire time, but the slow scenes may still put you off. Regardless Truman Show is a fantastic, ambitious in-depth and thought provoking film about social satire which makes you think deeply. The film's storyline music and performances are all well done, and the fact that it's twist makes you watch it from a different perspective completely also makes this film that much better. Overall rating: 9/10.",The Truman Show

The nonviolent cruelty placed on Truman is something that he doesn't realize will surprise you. And Truman doesn't notice he being cruelly treated. The director of the show (I forget who played him) was excellent in his role as the man who would try to kill the thing that made him famous. The roles are great, but Jim Carrey, however, was superb in his role as the clueless celebrity who everyone stares at. And this is a Jim Carrey film so you know it's packed with laughs, the funniest is when the director (noticing Truman's at the end of his little world) is talking to him with a loud, deep voice (he sounds like God) coming from the sky is hilarious, it's not flawless, but it's extremely good.",The Truman Show

A series best ever since the teeth episode. Worth the wait 10/10.The direction and style of the film reeks of a 80s mainstream comedy. The film improves throughout and expounds many interesting philosophical ideas by the end. It is no short of clever political and social commentary, and there are lots of great details, for example showing a still shot on TV draws an all time high viewership (subtly referring to real live TV shows and the audience's taste). There was a sequence in the middle where the creator reveals his throught process behind writing a scene for Truman, which make for an ingenious touch. There are a lot of moments like that, and they clearly show how well-thought the film is compared to many contemporaries of its time. It is certainly a film that demands several rewatches, and it provided how joyful of a ride it turns out to be, it is not hard to do so.Jim Carrey delivers a solid performance that showcases the full extent of his talents. His usual antics aside, there is also surprisinng amount of emotional depth at certain scenes. He is an underrated dramatic actor, and if you haven't seen him in Eternal Sunshine, I highly recommend it. The villain is also pretty awesome for a comedy of this calibre. Intelligent, electrifying and fundamentally human, it is a villain that we sympathize with, not the kind of cold and despicable stereotype that Hollywood movies haven't grown out of yet back in the 90s, and to a smaller extent today.My expectations were rather reserved before I saw this film.

You may recall the Oscar snub that year when Carrey failed even to get a nomination after he won the Golden Globe for the same role.  Carrey sans the silly faces and Jerry Lewis antics plays this very seriously and is brilliant.  Serious follow-up roles in MAN IN THE MOON and MAJESTIC have proved that Carrey has the chops to be a serious actor.  Hopefully Hollywood will stop typing him and the world will start accepting him for his more serious work.TRUMAN also stars the terribly under used Laura Linney who made such a wonderful splash with the indie YOU CAN COUNT ON ME.Briefly THE TRUMAN SHOW is a futuristic soap opera in which its star TRUMAN thinks his life is real.  He was born on TV and has lived his whole life there on camera.  The town in which he lives and all of the people who populate it are sets and actors hired to fill in his life.  How he discovers the truth and the manner in which the Network tries to prevent that is what the film is all about.If you have never seen THE TRUMAN SHOW and especially if you have enjoyed SIMONE, it should be on the top of your MUST rent list.",The Truman Show

The only good thing to say about the movie is that the more serious acting from Jim Carrey was impressive and the cinematography was effective.   Don't bother with this film.

364,ljsmith-25626,Easter Egg Extravaganza,9,13 July 2020,"I absolutely loved The Truman Show! What a film, both funny and mentally stimulating. It's as though every single camera shot and every single line of dialogue is used to conceal an Easter egg. A flash of lightning illuminating the moon to suggest the orbital satellite is much closer to Earth than it should be? Truman taking vitamin D pills with his breakfast every morning to hint at the fact he has never been exposed to actual sunlight? These are just a couple of the clues I picked up on my first watch that give away the intricacies of Truman's world - I cannot wait for my second watch to discover more.I honestly believe The Truman Show might be the founding father of 21st century reality TV - I wouldn't be at all surprised to find the idea for Big Brother was born after the producers watched this film.Jim Carrey carries the lead superbly, influencing the viewer to really sympathise with Truman and want the best for him (this is what makes the ending so triumphant). He was hard done by not to receive an Oscar nomination for the role. The supporting cast are all detestable in their efforts to block Truman from discovering the truth. I don't think I'll be able to watch Ozark now without questioning Laura Linney's genuineness as Wendy Bird - is she really in it for the family money laundering business or is her role simply to promote and explicitly advertise tourism in Missouri? After the impression she has left on me as Meryl Burbank in The Truman Show, watching Ozark may never be the same again.I really wish the runtime had been longer, even if only by an extra 15 minutes to take the total up to 2 hours - it's just one of those films I was willing desperately not to end! Also I wish we got to see what happens to Truman after he walks through that black door, particularly his reunion with Sylvia. I guess the ending was purposefully left open to interpretation, but it would've been a satisfying feel good closing scene to watch the star crossed lovers finally unite.Overall, my only criticism can be The Truman Show left me wanting more. 9/10.",The Truman Show

It starts, WITHOUT an introduction to the ""Truman Show,"" and as far as the audience knows, there IS NO ""Truman Show.""  The story unfolds about a man trying to find something that's real, like the romance with that girl who was taken away.  He doesn't know why she was taken away and neither do we... you see where I'm going with this?  Now this would have been a tiresome narrative in such a long movie, so naturally, it would be very short, perhaps it would never be a full-length film.  The realization that his life is a television show would happen at the same time for him as the audience and it would be a great twist ending rather than what it is: a clever short-film idea stretched into a full length film.",The Truman Show

This is one of Jim Carrey's more precise acting roles. He has a plethora of energy, but manages to keep it reined in. Laura Linney is average, Ed Harris underperforms, and Noah Emmerich almost steals the show at times. Noah has the best line in the film.Overall, it's a good movie that is worth watching (mainly for the scale of the show and for Jim's performance).

This movie is a combination of good comedy and great story. The story itself is so refreshing and thought provoking that one find this movie in their mind for a long time. I felt the movie was intensely spiritual and absolutely hilarious, you can actually relate the feeling of Truman to ourselves, the blow he gets when he realizes that whatever he thought was real wasn't, not even love...And how someone is shaping his life according to a predetermined story. The path Truman chooses, i.e to find an answer and escape from the unreal world, never giving up, is what is truly remarkable. It gives a message without boring us.

It might have given the movie a certain sense of pathos and let the audience identify a lot more with Truman.  As it was, I think that too much was given away too soon...knowing that it was a TV show in advance, made it harder to identify with Truman's dilemma.  It made all the show's action seem stilted, the reintroduction of his father obvious, and subplot with the mysterious redhead, unconvincing.  Even the social satire came off as overwrought.  As such, The Truman Show was not the great movie I was hoping for when I went to it.  It had great potential, and squandered it. So consider this, my could-have-been-better pitch.",The Truman Show

We will never be able to understand the world like the Almighty God. We have to rely on various carriers to get rid of our physical barriers, so that the mind can reach the long past, think about the long future, imagine the alien world, to meet our infinite curiosity and knowledge desire. In this sense, we have to agree with McLuhan's wisdom: ""media is the extension of human body"".
However, the paradox of the development of civilization is that it often goes to the opposite side of itself and becomes the accomplice of deprivation of freedom and elimination of subjectivity. Today, the popularity and rapid expansion of electronic media in the world has fully realized McLuhan's prediction of ""global village"". Because of this, people all over the world can watch the world of Truman on the same earth at the same time, so as to deduce the prying desire in human nature so vividly in such a vast space-time range.
The tragedy of reality lies in that in this era of media, no one can escape the fate of Truman, and no one has full confidence to say that he has nothing to do with Truman. In all kinds of TV reality shows, can't we see the shadow of Truman? When we are cheering for the super girl, can't we see the shadow of the audience holding the TV and Truman together? Today, economic interests drive everything, and the proliferation of business logic has forced us to play with ourselves.

378,danthemovieman,Another outstanding performance from Jim Carrey,9,27 October 2002,"Jim Carrey is becoming one of today's best actors. ""The Truman Show"" proves that. He plays Truman Burbank, an ordinary man who thinks that he lives an ordinary life. He actually is a twenty-four hour T.V. show that has been going on ever since he was born. Truman does not live in the world, he actually lives in an enourmas dome shaped building. He also doesn't know about how everybody around him is an actor, his mom's an actor, his best friend is and actor, even his wife is an actor, but he is not an actor. He starts to become suspicious about his life when his radio goes haywire and he hears a voice commenting on his every move. As the movie goes on he becomes more and more suspicious about his life. The acting is sensational, the music is beautiful, and the story line is clever. If you want to see Jim Carrey be dramatic and funny, you've got to see this. Even if you don't really like Jim Carrey all that much, you'll absolutely love this movie.

It's a commentary on what people want, what they crave, and how they operate. It deals with how much power one person can have over another, how you can't keep a person from being independent. There are many that say that the end of the movie was a cop-out, that he should have gotten revenge. I say it is completely perfect the way it is. It proves that the most basic human instinct is to know, to learn, and to be independent. So many movies try to be revolutionary, to be a metaphor for life and fall woefully short. Sometimes it's because the metaphor doesn't speak the way it should, sometimes it's simply because the quest for profoundness has stripped the movie of its entertainment value. This movie does neither. It speaks volumes, but it's still entertaining. And I don't think there is a movie ending that moves me to tears quite as frequently. I don't think there ever will be.",The Truman Show

This is added to by the production design and cinematography.The acting is great.  Ed Harris gives great support to Carrye as the sinister father figure Christof.The script is so subtle it probably feels more clever than it is.It is ultimately a very moving modern fable about a man trying to be his own person when the world is trying to manipulate him into being what they want.In case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening and good night.",The Truman Show

This movie is very different from any other movie i've ever seen. Eventhough in plot it's not extremely deep, it has an excellent premise which is more than a twilight zone rip-off.   One of the things that sets this movie apart from other alternate reality movies(edTV, Pleasantville)is the exquisite acting. Led by the pitch-perfect performance from Jim Carrey this movie has a great mix of excellent character actors. But like I said it is all fueled by Jim Carrey's brilliant Golden Globe© winning performance as Truman Burbank, a man whose life is on television 24/7. It is still beyond how he didn't even get nominated for an oscar when his performance was by far the best of that year. The other oscar worthy performance comes from the great Ed Harris(The Abyss, The Rock). Unlike Carrey, Harris did get nominated for an Academy Award©(He lost to James Coburn).   When you put all that together, along with the brilliant direction of Peter Weir, and you not only the best movie of 1998 but also one of the best movies of the 90's.

The Truman Show is a film on the level of grand classics, a frenzy of Bizarro Humor and life time morals. The movie manages to touch on themes of Life, Faith, and all while being a satire of Reality TV.Now I'm about twelve years late to the party, but even in the new decade Reality TV takes over the airwaves like no ones business. The Truman Show is still culturally relevant if not more so nowadays than when it was released. Seriously, the movie came out in an era where Flavor of Love hadn't existed yet.The story of The Truman Show is easy enough to say. Truman (Carrey) is the center of a reality TV show, and has been since his birth. The story begins to unfold as he begins to discover this fact. And if I said anything more I'd spoil the movie. Needless to say, the plot weaves through the key themes I mentioned before.There is no reason to not see this movie. It's a classic, an instant love. Its easy on the real melodrama, and if you were going to poke holes in it you'd have to work hard to find one that mattered very much. Overall, this movie leaves a message that is resounding.One of the best films to be released last decade, one of the best films ever made.",The Truman Show

And this is perfectly shown at the end of the movie.This movie is unique, it's neither too dramatic or too comic, there's a perfect balance between genres, and Jim Carrey does an incredible job, totally worth of Oscar nomination.

Jim Carrey turns in a great performance as Truman Burbank, who spends 30 years living his life in a TV show before realizing what's going on. It's not what you might expect from a Jim Carrey movie. There is no slapstick gross-out humor in the film. The movie is a drama that has some funny parts, but it is not intended to be a comedy. Not that that's a bad thing. In fact, it's a very good thing. There was nothing weak about Carrey's part in this movie. It proves that Jim Carrey is a truly gifted actor, unlike so many others who have made their name in slapstick comedy (Adam Sandler...). Carrey shows that he has a wide range of talents, and pulls of the dramatic acting without a hitch.Of course, there's more to the movie that just Jim Carrey. Peter Weir does a great directing job, giving us the views from the cameras that watch Truman's life. It works very well. And the supporting cast turn in great performances as well, especially Ed Harris as Christof, the director of the show. Of course, the other actors are overshadowed by Carrey's performance, but they still do a great job.""Touching"" might not be a word commonly associated with Jim Carrey films, but this one is. It has sad parts, it has happy parts...it is just a great drama. The only thing it doesn't have is the slapstick humor that got Jim Carrey famous. And I for one don't miss it. See this movie, it is truly great. Everyone involved does a great job, and Jim Carrey establishes himself as one of the best actors of our time, maybe of any time.Rating: 10/10",The Truman Show

""Jim Carrey"" gives his best ever performance as ""Truman Burbank"" a man whom lives his life the same day-to day for years until one day he starts to suspect that something in his world in very wrong he is the star of a reality TV show, there is very interesting questions raised about humanity and in today's society it's somehow became even more poignant in today's world of ""YouTube"" vlogs and reality shows.
""Ed Harris"" gives a phenomenal performance as ""Christof"" the creator of the show with a god complex he manipulates every aspect of Truman's life letting him have no free will, the way he talks and pronounces everything is superb, for those who have seen you know the movie's opening sequence is once again superb.
Some bits in this movie are hard to watch in which the ones that Truman trusts with all of his heart say say something really meaningful to him and we see it is all a lie is heart breaking, I would say more however I do not want to spoil but Truman does truly try to break ""the fourth- wall""

Weir has a way of drawing great (or at least greatish) performances out of his actors: Robin Williams in ""Dead Poets Society,"" Rosie Perez in ""Fearless.""  And Carrey has shown seeds of greatness before; rent ""Doing Time on Maple Drive"" (if you can find it) to see what I'm talking about.  Truman's entire life, since the day of his birth, has been orchestrated on a giant television studio set, the only world Truman knows, and televised worldwide as ""The Truman Show.""  Truman represents something impossibly difficult to find in our society today: an absolutely innocent person.  This goes a long way to explain his public's fascination with him.

I've seen the entire AFI 100 and every critically acclaimed movies that I can find.  Even so, I'd have to say that The Truman Show is one of the greatest movies ever to come out of Hollywood.  It's a perfect film.  The acting is great, the screenplay is phenomenal, and it is a very deep and symbolic movie.  I've seen it seven times and I pick up something new every time I watch it.  Even the title character's name, ""Truman Burbank,"" is oxymoronic and symbolic.  He is a ""true man"" who is the product of Hollywood.  You can even spot a few allusions to the crucifixion when Christof tries to stop Truman from escaping by flipping his boat.  The depiction of a Utopian society reminded me of Alduous Huxley's ""Brave New World,"" a world were freedom did not truly exist even though the citizens thought it did.  Why did they not do anything?  It's just like Christof said in a memorable and disturbing quote: ""We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented.""

That is what the surface of the picture demonstrates, but I also see it as a demonstration of this viewer culture we have in this modern age of social media. Everything we watch on screen are virtually entertainment for us whether it is about two people yelling and fighting on the street or a reality show about god knows what. I love how the picture let us see that in the final scene where, after everyone had finished cheering for Truman's escape, they immediately just continued to deliberating which channels or shows to watch next. In other words, they never really cared about Truman's life and freedom or his desire to escape, they only see it as a part of their entertainment. Truman's happiness, sadness, struggles are nothing more than just entertainment and good TV for the audience. Additionally, if I may add, I love how Truman didn't care or inquire much about what is the real world like - for all he knows, the real world could be a dystopian wasteland and humans in chains, but regardless he just wanted to be anything by a spectacle, anything but living in a surreal and superficial world.

Peter Wier managed to render a masterly psychological and challenging experience in a concise way, simple and to the point, accessible to all. For that he deserves all the praise he can get because, as far as I'm concerned it is enormously difficult to express a profound message in a manner so classy and suggestive.The acting was good enough, not great but still good. Jim Carrey did very well as Truman Burbank the central character of this title, not as well as he did in ""Man on the Moon"" for example, but still he was satisfactory, Ed Harris has exemplary shown Christoff's character and perspective, an eccentric genius willing to overlook any moral law in the name of television. Laura Linney did just fine as she was quite convincing in her very intriguing role, taking into account that she played a pretended wife, who played an actress, if you appreciate the irony.To conclude, Truman Show is an impressive title, which can not let anyone indifferent because of it's spectacular scenario presented in such a suggestive, sometimes even hilarious, manner. I appreciate it as one of the best films of the last 50 years, and accordingly deserves a maximum ***** out of *****",The Truman Show
405,roberjruiz,I hated Jim Carrey until I saw this film,9,16 February 2014,"I hate Jim Carrey comedies. I just find it's humor too childish, too simple (I know, Hollywood payed him very well to behave in the films like he did). Fortunately Jim Carry demonstrated to be an actor with more pretensions than doing always the same role. As a result, he made this spectacular movie.The movie is funny, and at some points Jim Carry behaves like Kim Carrey, but the film is far more than the stupid comedies in which he acted before.Truman is the biggest attraction to spectators all over the World. He was born in a cinema studio, he is property of the studio, and his life is transmitted all over the World: The best of all reality shows, a real life on TV: He has a father, mother, friends ... all actors but Truman who suspects nothing about the deception. But suddenly things begin to work the wrong way. Truman would love to travel abroad, and some members of the cast began to remorse about what they are doing ...",The Truman Show
406,misterlinder,The Truman Show - an original and innovative movie!,9,26 February 2010,"The movie starts exactly at the point, when Truman begins to realize, that he's living in a constructed reality soap opera: A light of the artificial night sky falls down and nearly hits him. But also the spectator of the movie begins to wonder about the strange things that happen to Truman. By and by, the spectator gets aware of the fact, that Truman's life is filmed through thousands of hidden cameras and broadcasted live around the world, what makes the story so extraordinary. So the movie is definitely not just about an all-day story, therefore I think that the plot is quite original and innovative. The fact that the spectator of the film gets inducted into Truman's secret even earlier than Truman himself makes his actions really funny and gripping.However, the story of Truman isn't funny at all, it's rather tragic. The plot and the well- fitting music keep the film quite moving and the spectator begins to feel sympathy for Truman.Finally, the movie turns out well, but the story keeps you thinking about today's TV and its influence on people.All in all, the Truman Show is a beautiful movie with a fascinating story and moving background music, and though it's already more than 10 years old, I can thoroughly recommend you to watch it!",The Truman Show
407,er-guille,A somewhat touching story,8,3 January 2007,"This is a very entertaining movie. Not classic material, mind you, but a nice little movie, without great mistakes. Jim Carrey's acting shows a certain improvement since his funny faces are not there anymore. Ed Harris performance as the cold hearted Christof is actually very good (nominated for an Oscar, if memory serves right). The plot is quite original and even though t has its similarities with EdTV, personally I like the treatment it got in this movie. The subtle psychological manipulation of Truman Burbank to keep him from finding out that he is just a character in a Reality Show has some ""orwellian"" spin (1984?, Big Brother?). The final scene, when Truman overcomes his fears and finally finds out the truth it's really well done. All and all, it's not a really big film, but it's good enough for a rainy weekend at home with the family. Rent it. 7/10",The Truman Show
408,jacklyn_lo,"A cheerful movie with optimism, hope & power of an individual",8,3 August 2015,"The Truman Show. Review. IMDb Director: Peter Weir Main role: Jim CarreyA cheerful movie with optimism, hope & power of an individual. I really enjoyed this tragicomedy with spiritual core! The plot is an allegory of a spiritual reality, which is created for the protagonist ( and read between lines - for every and each human being) in accordance to develop his consciousness, i.e. a soul.The ""one man show"" is revealing a huge investment and effort of a Higher World (Director of the show and his crew in the movie) into a human being as well as human's challenges to get rid of the illusion of the tough magnetism of materialistic reality. Young and charming Jim Carrey is awesome in the role of Truman Burbank. That character is probably the most positive role of Jim Carrey.The culmination of the movie was when the director of the show dramatically increased the volume of the storm and Truman almost died in the waves. This could be considered as an allegory of a spiritual challenge and Burbank's victory.The end is open: what will happen the next to this guy? This movie is a wonderful sample how a very complex spiritual idea could be implemented into entertaining movie. BRAVO!",The Truman Show
409,souvikriju,watching first time in 2020 and still it is fresh.,10,7 June 2020,"The Truman Show : Oh man ! how I missed this. The Gem of a Cinema. And only Jim Carrey can pull off the role of Truman with such an ease.It is super entertaining as well as though proviking. Its about a tv show which is live for 24 hours 7 days in a week for continuously 30 years and Truman is the protagonist, his whole life is the show.
What a concept, released in 1998 but still fresh.It is thought provoking because it gives you some important messages like people's addiction for TV, Fake world arround us, and Willingness of Freedom which is only the Truth in a very entertaining nd engaging way.
Loved it absolutely.",The Truman Show
410,Shan-12,Not that bad but Not that good - or even more than marginally original either,5,5 June 1999,"Back in 1990, at about 3pm I was watching an episode of The Twilight Zone where a man had caught someone removing a hidden camera from the wall in his house. This leads to a series of discoveries, such that he is on a television station dedicated solely to showing him and everything he does, 24 hours a day. Furthermore, he finds his life has been manipulated, they have set him up with a better job and even his marriage and so on - stop me if you heard any of this before. Obviously on a smaller scale but close to identical, the difference being he has benefitted as much as he has lost out in the invasion of privacy, maybe even more, thereby leading to an intriguing and enigmatic ending.This in itself isn't a problem really. However, there are problems in this film. The foremost one is that, as with any long running enterprise of any kind, it when things go wrong, it's quite believable that they occur in a cluster.It is not believable that for such a long running and highly controlled operation as The Truman Show that the operators would miss Truman's father getting back on the set AND him finding people waiting ""off stage"" where there should have a lift AND not having anything prepared if Truman were to ever want to see what his wife does at work (what, no contigency plan written a long time ago, only something thrown together at the last minute that only just works?) AND the policeman at the ""nuclear accident"" by name AND the truly clumsy fashion cars block his attempts to leave which might as well scream TRUMAN, you're living in a dome and we're all watching you on TV.Yes, things would go wrong and almost inevitably a whole lot at once somewhere along the way but it's hard to believe the operators would be so inept so many times in succession over such a short period of time. The script falls down in clumsily presenting these scenes instead alternatively, have things that don't fit together perfectly (the people setting it up only work there, Truman is living it every day and would spot things they wouldn't) but are more subtle with Truman picking them up piece by piece and eventually working things out that way. Becoming gradually aware over time in a much more gradual and subtle fashion than the way that happens.Ed Harris is excellent and the way (to Truman) his voice looks like it is literally coming down from the heavens is great. Jim Carrey and the rest of the cast do quite well in the acting department.Of course, just to extrapolate from the ending knowing big business the show could go on after the end: imagine the interviews with Christof, the following and documenting of Truman in the outside world, tours of the dome, even the sale of houses inside it. Inevitably the selection of another child and starting the thing again. There'd still be money in it all.So anyway, just remember, not bad but could have been better and don't whatever you do call it original, almost exactly the same thing has been done maybe as much as 10 years ago or more.",The Truman Show
411,jpmurga,One of the top 10 movies ever,10,5 February 1999,"I was surprised when I saw this movie, I didn't know Jim Carrey could be such a great actor. I think the movie is the only one that has a shot of beating SPR at the oscars. By seeing all the comments written here you can see that this is a movie that makes you think, and it was a mix of a really artistic movie with a blokbuster movie. I give it a 10",The Truman Show
412,failedscreenwriter,Which Reality?,9,22 May 2000,"A really good movie can be just as interesting for what it does not say. ""The Truman Show"" seems to be in the not-too-distant future. Nothing is said about the way people live, but we get the impression it's not pretty. Maybe there is a restrictive government, or total corporate control. In any case, people's lives are pointless and Truman's life becomes an idealized substitute for their own.Unfairly trashed by the Academy, ""The Truman Show"" is both a well-acted and compelling story, and a brilliant satire with something to say. Jim Carrey plays a man whose entire life is defined by outside forces--but is it so different for any of us? We all tend to become those labels that society has given us. Furthermore, it is a very straightforward jab at our current tendency toward voyeurism. When celebrity gossip passes for ""news,"" when we live vicariously through the wanna-be exhibitionists on ""Real World,"" when viewers treat a televised police chase as if it were a thermonuclear war, ""The Truman Show"" can't be far away.",The Truman Show
413,sherbear-2,Not very far from reality....,10,8 June 2001,"The Truman Show is quite an amazing movie.  Once it ended the first time I saw it, I went through the next few days looking for hidden video cameras and suspecting everyone.  That's the impact this movie had on me way back in 1998.  If I had seen it for the first time in the year 2001, I wouldn't have been quite as shocked, since shows like ""Survivor"" and ""The Mole"" have become quite common.  I pray that a storyline like Truman's stays in the movies and isn't transfered to reality TV.  Anyway, bottom line, this is an exellent movie that really makes you think.  Jim Carrey proves his talent beyond comedy with this role.",The Truman Show
414,Harpo 2046,One of the best roles of J.Carrey,10,14 July 2001,"I have seen this film many times, and I can say that I am ready to see this many other times.  There are several reasons, but the most important one is certainly J.Carrey.  I have seen many films in which he acts but in this film, he is really excellent.  And the next most important reason is A.Niccol, the writer and the director of ""Gattaca"".  If you liked ""Gattaca"", you will probably like this one, because you will see the same kind of strange world.
I advise people to see this film, also because of E.Harris, who is one of the greatest actors today.",The Truman Show
415,shahmatt,A superb movie. But why is it a comedy?,8,13 April 2004,"I was just wondering why people think this movie is a comedy. I thought it was scary, sad, and incredibly compelling. Reminded me of the Matrix, where the people really didn't know that the real world is out there.
I think that the most terrifying thing would be if this concept was true. That the world is a stage and we are its actors. If it was true how would we know? Are we really just a part of a grand tv show to some superior being? Don't certain religions teach something like that?This movie gets an 8/10 because it got me thinking. It made me see that life is just a bloody play act anyway. We act everything anyway don't we? We go to work.. and Act there....We go home to our families... and Act there.... We say our prayers...and Act again ... is nothing Real? Even Love... doesn't it turn into an act after a while?!?!?Darn it folks!

They messed with his mind, attacked him, and tried to force him to stay in the fake town. It was so great when Truman told off the evil director and left. It would have been great if the director died. During the film, I imagined myself going up to him with a gun and shooting him in the head. The sad thing is that there is people like him in real life that would do anything to make a profit even if it included brainwashing someone for thirty years. I'm surprised that barely anyone outside the set had any problems with a person's whole life being manipulated.",The Truman Show

Every single time I watch this movie, I always have a great time watching it. I love The Truman Show! It's easily my favorite dramatic movie of Jim Carrey. It's an amazing movie, and I recommend everyone to see this movie if you haven't seen it yet.",The Truman Show
418,JSVoid,A well presented commentary on freedom and societal reality.,9,7 May 2020,"The Truman Show is an interesting commentary on consumerism, power and freedom. In fact, it is one of the best examples of these in cinema. With its wide range of interesting cinematography that fits into the world of the film, it's interesting story line and its compelling acting, it is definitely a motion picture that will be remembered.Now, an interesting argument is whether this is a film or a movie. I have had difficulties deciding where to stand on this, because it has both commercial interest and artistic integrity throughout. Either way, I think I would sway more towards the side of it being a film. Because of its swelling orchestral soundtrack that offers moments of peace and freedom, its cinematographical style and its commentary on modern society, I believe putting it under the category of a movie would be doing it an injustice.I think this film was a good mix of technical elements and a good story, specifically how the two played into each other. The cameras inside Truman's world are mentioned, and we get many different shots that offer that sort of wide-angle type look which plays into the idea that Truman is being watched by the audience, and us subsequently. While it does this, it's still making it easy to understand and compelling to watch when it comes to the story. The reason this is the case is because of the characters, specifically Truman. His character is not only relatable but driven to overcome his fear and fulfill his dreams. This is inspiring and relatable to us because we empathize with him and we often feel trapped in society and consumer based living too.Cristoff's point that ""We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented"" is true in Truman's world, but not in ours. Where as some may stay close minded, most of us have art to show us the truth and commentaries of our own reality, but Truman doesn't. He lives in his own world where everything is catered to him and dependent that he doesn't find out his life is staged, so of course he isn't going to question it. Therefore, I disagree with Cristoff's statement.I would like to see the reality that most lives are run by products and the next consumable goods, whereas I believe we should live off of love, kindness, art and the simplicity of life itself.I think there are quite a few positives to the current situation. For example, the world itself and nature is becoming healthier, most of us are able to reflect and enjoy the small things in life, and many other things. It's always important to be optimistic and I don't see why a shift in reality would change that.I think many parts of society would consider him a villian, as it is obvious we are rooting for Truman, and so is the audience within the world of the film. However, many immoral critics and snobby artists would praise him for his ""art"" of showing Truman's life. Even though it is fake and all constructed, they may see it as a fascinating masterpiece of a TV show.This film is definitely worthy of discussion and quite good at telling its story. I loved rewatching it and it was great to review.",The Truman Show

421,seamanm,Time to make some enemies on imdb! I like it!,6,2 March 1999,"I note some imdb reviewers comments. Those people who describe The Truman Show as ""boring"" or ""not funny"" completely miss the point. I would venture to suggest that they are the kind of individuals who watched every episode of Dallas or Dynasty (or for my fellow Brits, Coronation Street or Eastenders). These types do not like to have their addiction mocked, which this movie does so well. REAL life is not perfect, with every little thing being organised to suit. As someone once said, ""s**t happens"". Although I may not have cast the admittedly excellent Carrey as Truman, his eventual desire to find out if ""the truth is out there"" is human nature at it's most real. Don't we all want to know the truth to our lives? Overall an original movie, and God knows, there are few enough of them.

Philip Glass' music- a little over-the-top, but brilliant. I am not condemning the Academy for the choices they have made, but in the process, some serious talent was overlooked. This is Carrey's most brilliant film to date (unless Man on the Moon lives up to its hype). This is probably one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces of the 20th Century, and even if Carrey wasn't decided to be the grestest candidate for the Oscar, the film should've been.",The Truman Show
423,halnexus,**** (Out of four),10,7 May 1999,"Some general comments about the grave injustice of this film being robbed by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences would obviously be unnecessary due to the high amounts of people demanding an explanation for the inexplicable lack of a Best Picture Oscar nomination for this film. So let me just go about in praising this film: ""The Truman Show"" was definitely the best movie of 1998 and one of the five best of the decade, behind ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Schindler's List"" and ""Forrest Gump"".  What struck me about the film is just how meticulous everything was.  Andrew Niccol and Peter Weir really thought everything out to its fullest dimension!  It took me two viewings to appreciate this film's greatness, but the scene that will always strike me is just how carefully orchestrated Truman's moonlight stroll by the beach with Lauren/Sylvia is used to elicit an emotional reaction.  Chopin's ""Piano Concerto No. 1 in E Minor"" has never sounded so melancholy and beautiful as this wonderful scene, and the breathtaking imagery and careful build-up to Truman's makeshift assemblage of her face is one of the most impressive and subtle plot developments I have EVER seen. Weir does not bang us over the head with this film, unlike some films that were inexplicably crowned with the sheath of greatness (namely ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"" or ""Saving Private Ryan""...a well-made film, no doubt, but not the greatest war film ever made).  Whoever claims that this film could have been more missed the point of subtlety that this film was trying to get across...what did you want, Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis suddenly appearing on the screen to deliver some Oliver Stone-style message on violence or the JFK conspiracy?  The film's climax is one of the most surreal and strangely moving pieces of cinema I have EVER seen, and just the way Carrey enunciates a pained ""Was nothing real?"" to Ed Harris was worth an Oscar nomination alone.  Give me Carrey's nuanced performance over the contortions and muggings of Benigni anyday, a trait he must have inherited from...Carrey himself!  Oh well, to give this film the recognition it deserves would be to misrepresent the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as a sincere, incisive group of people instead of the smug and sanctimonious group of bootlickers they truly are.",The Truman Show
424,redneck-6,One of my favorites.,8,1 October 2000,"Jim Carrey portrays Truman Burbank, a man raised from birth by a corporation to star in a televised life in a town that's merely a facade, surrounded by family and friends who really only regard him as a coworker.  It's certainly not the comedy I was expecting, though it stars Jim Carrey and does contain some comedic moments.  Upon viewing, I found it to be intensely dramatic, and quite moving when all was said and done.  The film can speak on a very literal level, aptly skewering our society's obsession with voyeurism and the media's rapacious appetite for conent,  or on a spiritual level, with the gigantic set upon which Truman's ""life"" takes place becoming an allegorical Eden.  While it makes some remarks about what could be considered rather dark characteristics of the modern media's role in society, the film itself is far from dark, and in fact contains a very uplifting message in the end. Jim Carrey turns in an excellent dramatic performance as his character slowly comes to realize that the things happening in his life are sometimes quite odd and surreal.  Ed Harris is good as well as the producer who watches the events in the manufactured town from on high (another obvious spiritual metaphor).  All of the main characters, in fact, do a very good job of switching between Truman's acquaintances and actors simply moving on and off of a set, turning off and on their apparent feelings for the main character.  My favorite scenes were the ones in which Truman appears at his most human, doing something outside of the producer's tightly scripted goings on around the small town. Even if you ignore all of the messages and just take the film as a simple narrative of the events in a man's life, it is paced and filmed well enough that it will probably entertain most people.  And while I've read a few reviews that speak poorly of the ending, I thought it was perfect considering the central theme of the movie.  I highly recommend it.",The Truman Show
425,hoorayformikereed,A Personal Favorite,10,27 November 2002,"I don't care how many times I've seen this movie, I can still find something to enjoy in it. At least 20 times later, it still moves me and excites me just as much as it did the first time, which, to me makes it one of the best movies ever made.Jim Carrey sheds his hyperactive manic personality that has earned him so much money to play the straight man, and conjures up a believable and endearing character. As Truman, Carrey brings a feeling of wide-eyed innocence to the role, and effortlessly portrays Truman's realization that the world around him is all a farce.With enough imagination, wonder, humor and emotion for five movies, The Truman Show is a brilliant, somewhat overlooked masterpiece that can easily hold it's own against many classic movies. In my mind it already is one.(****/****)",The Truman Show
426,jsataluri,Surprise! No hysterical comedy anymore!,9,7 January 2006,"When my family and I watched the movie, we expected a hysterical comedy. Instead we got a drama about a man whose life is a TV show and how he slowly realizes that it's fake and tries to escape from the fantasy he's living in. This has got to be one of Jim Carrey's greatest performance. It was a chance for him to prove that he is an actor and not just a comic and he perfects it well. Ed Harris, a good actor gives one of his greatest performances ever as Christof, the creator, the ""father"" and the villain who obsesses with the Truman Show so much that he makes Truman a prisoner in his world.There are some flaws though. Why did Christof have to obsess about Truman so much? What was so special about Truman that made everyone watch him on the TV? And what was Christof trying to prove in his show? That people's private lives must be watched by others? Though the flaws kind of drag the movie a little, it is nonetheless a masterpiece and one of Jim Carrey's greatest and I think he should play more dramatic roles that one day will get him a Oscar that he deserves.9 out of 10.",The Truman Show
427,navenkumarselva,The fantasy that you never thought of!,8,14 June 2017,"The Truman Show is a fantasy film that was released back in 1998. The first thing that caught my attention was the concept of this film. The concept of this film was related to the influence of media in everyday life. The Truman Show is about a person called Truman Burbank who lives in a small island called Seahaven near the coast of Florida where nothing really happens. Everything in life almost perfect, but certain events of the past often disturb his feelings towards the life he lives. The sudden turn of events and suspicious happenings around him makes him more curious to discover the world he lives in. Therefore, Truman sets out on his voyage to unlock the mysterious happenings and seeks for the answers to his questions. The first person to be credited is story writer Andrew Niccol who also co-produced this film. His writing showed futuristic thinking and thought provoking ideas that were quite absent at that time zone. Director Peter Weir should be given a huge congratulation for taking up this story and delivering it in great fashion which entertaining, engaging, thought provoking and heartwarming at the end. The film starts in a slow pace as editing were quite sloppy and elevation of scenes which potentially confuses its viewers. As time went on, the introductory of characters and comic timing of the dialogues really pulled me into whole scenario of weird behaviors of each and every character in the film. The curiosity to know the answers to Truman's questions slowly crept into me and the only reason could be the ever relate-able Truman's character to real life and again, full credits had to go to Peter Weir for creating a great character that could gain our sympathy.The next thing which I was really impressed with is the dialogues of this film which was co-jointly written by Andrew Niccol and Peter Weir. The dialogues in the film really worked well with every character in the film especially in the comedy department that gave good laughs throughout the film. Coming to the backbone of this film, Jim Carrey who absolutely carried this film as his child. Jim Carrey lived as Truman in this film. The smartness, stupidity and curiosity were shown in his ever expressive face and the ambiance of his expressions could be felt throughout the film which made it a more amazing experience. Jim Carrey was the only actor that could pull off this role with such perfection. Hats off.Supporting casts in the film like Noah Emmerich and Ed Harris had important roles in the film and played them really well. The more important among them was Ed Harris' character in the film. A sense of seriousness enters the screen every time he shows up just because of his menacing and hard look throughout the film. The cast is roundly superb even if the majority of them are in minor roles. The cinematography of Peter Biziou was great all along, my favorites were the scenes at the sea and aerial shots at night. The editing of this film was good overall despite feeling slightly off place and sloppy at times. The only reason is the inconsistent screenplay of this film especially in the first hour. Some scenes were elevated in a slow pace which made the film a bit lengthy. This is the only drawback in this filmOverall, The Truman Show is a mind boggling futuristic piece of film making that is thought provoking and entertaining at the same time. It might not have won anything at the Academy Awards, but it certainly won hearts of millions watching it. This is one of those movies which is a classified classic, certainly worth watching a few times, hats off to the makers.",The Truman Show

430,BlancheDeLaForce,How's it going to end?,10,16 February 2002,"(Warning: spoilers ahead) For me, The Truman Show is as close to a perfect movie as you are likely to get: not only it provides you with abundant food for thought, but also it is beautiful to see and very, very entertaining. It goes beyond the simple speculation about the value of privacy and the lack of ethics in the entertainment business, but it leads to ponder about weightier things, for instance the matter of a sheltered but not very interesting life vs. a life of adventure with nothing guaranteed. Also, the reason why utopias don't work: Christof thinks that a world that resembles a fifties movie is the perfect world, whereas Truman's dream is to explore some South Pacific island never visited by man. And, of course, the quest for truth vs. a beautiful lie: In his obstinate search for the true world, Truman understands that truth's beauty surpasses any lie, no matter how shiny or cozy.The movie is full of visual beauty, especially towards the end, when the ""perfect"" world starts to unravel with Truman's flight. The Magrittesque images of the moon-as-a-spotlight, the boat ramming the sky and Truman walking on water to a staircase apparently suspended above the horizon are the kind of thing that you just can't forget.Jim Carrey plays a perfect Truman, innocent but also determined. In fact it is hard to imagine another actor playing this role. Ed Harris is also perfect, truly frightening in a role that would have looked ridiculous in the hands of a lesser actor. Laura Linney, as Truman's dimple-cheeked ""wife"" plays very well the sinister side of her character.Of course, everyone is free to dislike this movie, but there are some things I'd like to say about the negative comments: to begin with, lots of people wondered about the possibility of anyone wanting to see a TV program like this... The only thing I have to say about this is that I'm surprised at how fast (only within a couple of years) this objection has become irrelevant. The other objection was about the movie's allegedly ""happy"" ending. I don't think the ending is ""happy"": Truman and Sylvia disappear both through dark doorways, and, although we are free to imagine that they will eventually be together and happy living in Fidji, we don't know if this is really what will happen. But this is the point, isn't it, not to know how's it going to end?",The Truman Show

433,MiB-6,They Don't Get Any Better Than This,10,3 October 1998,"An on-film miracle is the only words to describe this masterpiece of a movie. Peter Weir's dark insight into the world of television is more powerful than those classic films ""Network"" and ""Broadcast News"", in that it uses an imaginary, but starkly realistic story to show how people bring what they see on t.v. into their lives, overcoming their own personal lives. Jim Carrey does his best and succeeds in a great but non Oscar-worthy performance. But Ed Harris is the real star here, his role which contains only several minutes of screen-time represents the evil face of the media. His powerful performance really deserves at least an Oscar nomination, along with the overly underrated Peter Weir who has made four of the most original films of alltime now.",The Truman Show

Our thinking has created the world as it is now. Whenever we label something as good or bad or create a preference in our mind, it is due to the coming into being of egoic structures or self-interests. The solution is not to fight for peace or conquer nature, but to simply recognise the truth; that the very existence of the ego structure creates duality, a split between self and other, mine and yours, man and nature, inner and outer. The ego is violence; it requires a barrier, a boundary from the other to be. Without the ego, there is no war against anything. There is no hubris, there is no overreaching nature to create profit. These external crises in our world reflect a severe inner crisis; we don't know who we are. We are wholly identified with our egoic identities, consumed by fears and are cut off from our true nature. Races, religions, countries, political affiliations, any group that we belong to, all reinforce our egoic identities.",The Truman Show

Darkly funny, strangely sad, I enjoyed every moment.The plot centres on Truman and his Hollywood made world. A world where he is the unwitting star and everyone is in on it. There the entire world is witness to every moment of Truman Burbanks incredible life - a life carefully orchestrated by Christof.

441,ennyman,"The Truman Show: Original, Remarkable, Profound",10,6 November 2006,"The Truman Show is a remarkable movie. Truman (Jim Carrey) is a character on a TV show whose entire life has been watched by millions worldwide, from birth through adolescence up to the present. Truman is not aware that his world is an artificial one created specifically for the purposes of its director producer Christof (Ed Harris). It is a story of Truman's awakening. And a story about Life. The movie can be taken on several levels. As entertainment, it works as a story which itself has levels.Christof as creator of Truman's world ... is godlike, attempting to create a Paradise for his ""son"".Truman is a ""type"" of ourselves, the existential human condition. He is in a situation, inside the box, in his ""world"", unaware initially of the outside world, of anything beyond...Because Truman is a being with consciousness, he gets ""clues"" that things are not what they seem. Events occur that indicate the way he originally perceived his life is different from the way it really is. Examples include: · The studio light falling from the sky · The character he falls in love with · The strange way his wife does ""commercials"" · The re-appearance of his father · The technical error when the car radio switches to set directions Truman at one point remarks, ""It feels like the whole world revolves around me somehow."" The girl he meets (so briefly) and falls in love with... is a type of those who are enlightened, who know that life is more than what we see, think, understand. She seeks to reach him, but he does not understand her words because of his frame of mind. He is trapped inside his mindset.... Ultimately, we are each like Truman. We are unaware, and as a consequence passive about seeking freedom from our situation. Through chance events we become ""awakened"" and begin to notice the periodic clues that tell us that life is more than it appears to be.The result of this awakened consciousness is a decision to act.From my 1985 Journal notes: ""To understand the world we live in, we must first see it as it is, not as we are trained or manipulated to see it. Where do our ideas come from? Ideas about God, about right and wrong, about how we should live... Are they chosen? or...?""It is interesting that while the world Truman inhabits is counterfeit, the emotions he feels are real. So with ourselves, we do not really perceive things as they really are, but the emotions we feel ~ our fears, hopes, anxieties ~ these are very real. In another sense we are also like the other players in Truman's world: Like the ""extras"" and bit part actors, we tend to get caught up in playing our roles, but not really concerned about the real situations of the persons around us. Our lives can become all script, all ""show"".... In real life, we can be so busy with our ""roles"" that we do not consider others' needs. Truman's ""awakening"" leads to a single overwhelming desire to obtain his freedom from this ""world"" that is his life. Perhaps on another level we are like Christof, manipulating all the sets, all the characters, for a ""higher purpose"".... personal glory. Christof sought ratings. He was a Mastermind.... But in achieving this end he degraded Truman's humanity. All people in the show were his to manipulate. It was his right, he believed, and he was possibly even sincere in his love for Truman, who was a ""son"" to him.At times we ourselves think we have a right to control everything. We each want to be Christof in our own sphere of influence. It is unsettling when one of the characters is unpredictable, doesn't follow the script, does not cooperate with the ""show"". Ultimately, this can lead to a crisis, and the relationships can change. Christof offered Truman a safe, crime-free world... but Truman wanted something more valuable: his freedom.When Truman began his quest he was not even aware of what it was he was escaping from, but he knew he must escape. Ultimately, he was seeking to escape from the Bubble, the Dome, his artificial world. Like Truman we, too, must strive to escape in order to find our true selves and to see what life is all about. Like Truman we have become immersed in a world of illusions. But the Quest cannot be successful without taking risks. Truman's quest became an obsession. In order to escape he had to face his greatest fears, real fears. And it nearly cost him his life. But he found the door, a door he didn't even know existed... and upon walking through to the other side he would find a new understanding as he left behind everything that was known and familiar to embrace the unknown. Little did he know that ""she"" was going to be there.... waiting for him. So, too, with us there are clues, if we would but observe them, that life is more than just the material, physical molecular world. The Scriptures are a book of clues. The ""Grand Design"" of nature presents us with manifold clues. Conscience is a clue. And deep within our hearts, the ""still, small voice."" ""In case I don't see you.... Good afternoon, good evening, and good night.""",The Truman Show
442,reigntall,"A great movie, that is way ahead of its time.",10,28 December 2010,"The plot circles around Truman (Jim Carrey). His entire world (a small town) is just a giant movie set. There are hidden cameras and everybody else is an actor/actress. He, however, has no idea. There are a couple of scenes that show people just glued to the TV watching the show. And apparently it is the most popular show on TV. The amazing thing about this unique plot is, that it was released in 1998, when there weren't all that many reality TV shows. The show becomes more and more relevant with its message of people being hypnotized by reality TV and forgetting to live their own lives.Jim Carrey is amazing. Unlike his other works (Dumb and Dumber and others) he doesn't do over the top comedy. The humor in this movie is of a different sort. It is more subtle. This is Carrey's first serious movie, and it is astounding how he didn't get an Oscar nomination for his performance. He proves himself as an excellent actor, not just a funny man. It is a shame he hasn't taken on more roles in similar dramas.The supporting cast is also great, including Ed Harris, who got nominated for best supporting actor for his role as director of the show.It is a very unique movie with an underlying commentary on society and is full of great subtle comedy.

443,alxx0209,Carrey is in a huge Winner,10,4 August 2013,"This is my 12th movie review on IMDb. First thing to say is that the entire movie plot - I have never seen/ heard a movie this original before. I have seen Jim Carrey in a some other movies like Bruce Almighty / Ace Ventura and other films were he is funny however for this film funny does not describe it enough !! this movie is funny , real , fun , charming , has heart , intriguing , juicy , touching , has a lot of soul in it , witty , clever and very unique in many ways. Well first before I talk about the movie I would like to say that Peter Weir seems to be a great director - although I have not seen his movie Witness that stars Harrison Ford( that people seem to mention the most on here ) I have seen Dead Poets Society and Fearless that I would say are underrated masterpieces ( i should review those movies on here soon ) !! and this film belongs in the masterpiece category as well it would only make logical sense for me to put ' Witness ' on my Netflix list to watch eventually. So let me talk about this movie a little bit here Truman Burbank is a star of a 24 hour TV show that he has no idea about when he starts to realizes something is wrong in his life his goal ? to be free - he has to "" BREAK out of the CAGE "" but who gets in the way Ignorant / stubborn / arrogant Christof who as well was brilliantly played the actor whose name is Ed Harris. He is the villain of the movie.Outstanding !!!! this movie is 100 % creative / great actors and Jim Carrey is real innocent emotional human. Ed Harris did a great job , there's a beautiful flow start to end with a wonderful ending of Truman , sound track is amazing , camera shots were greatly unique / lines * the movie had a bunch of great / comical one lines that i need to remember and script gets an A + its rare for a movie to get 10 out 10 however this one deserves it !!!!",The Truman Show

445,SpaceMonkey-Mafioso,Truman!,9,22 March 2003,"To state it simply: The Truman Show is a modern day classic. Great Concept, great script, great direction and great performances. The movie works in two ways. First, it is an often hilarious satire of the entertainment industry. But, it's not really a satire of reality TV; when Truman came out in 1998, the only mainstream reality shows were Real World and Cops. Nicol's script actually predicted America's (and the world's) fascination with reality based programming. Second and more importantly, Truman Show is a statement about human existence. Truman represents all of us. He is the every man, the true-man. That may sound pretentious, but it works beautifully. Throw in Weir's tight direction and amazing performances by Carrey, Harris and Linney and you have one of the best films of the 90's. A must see.",The Truman Show

It's not original and not socially bagged or critical like some might think. I had this feeling that everyone were paid actors/aliens/whatever since I was little. Did I run to make a movie about it?

The way the story progresses is extremely wonderful as we try to look behind the cracked bricks of the fourth wall rather than being fed the classic 100-season show that we are used to following on TV. The only thing that bugs me about this masterpiece is that it doesn't really show us a bit more of Truman's descent to madness after learning the truth.

453,big_ringer,A Masterpiece,10,6 January 2006,"I remember when this movie first came out in the theater, and I had a chance to catch it. Back then, it was considered a vast departure for Jim Carrey, seeing as he's only been in comedies such as the Ace Ventura movies. In retrospect, ""The Truman Show"" was only a harbinger of the kind of acting he could do. But it wasn't his movie alone, Andrew Niccol's script and Peter Weir's direction and the rest of the cast that make this movie work on so many levels.One level in which ""The Truman Show,"" along with its counterpart, ""Ed TV"" works, is that both movies pre-date the whole ""reality TV"" craze by a good 2 or 3 years. Oh, we had ""The Real World"" but that was the extent of it...this was before MTV was milking its incarnations for all its worth, and definitely before ""Survivor,"" ""The Simple Life,"" and those ""Celebreality"" shows on VH1. The scenes in which people react to the things Truman does and hang on his every movement is no different than how people tune in for the next episode of ""Survivor"" waiting on who will be ""voted off the island."" Another theme that is evident in the movie is the desire for absolute control as shown in the character of Christof. He has structured Truman's world as to who could or couldn't talk to him, using any means necessary to keep him on the island, and ultimately losing. While it seems that Christof has a connection to Truman, he is merely a means to an end, which is a televised life, from cradle to grave.One thing that I need to point out again is Jim Carrey's acting. ""The Truman Show"" is his first serious role, departing from the sight-gag movies of his earlier career. His acting is so reserved, and yet, there are funny moments of his, but it doesn't break from the tone of the movie or his overall character. Everyone was caught by surprise in this apparent 180, especially film critic duo Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. They were so impressed by Carrey that they publicly apologized to him for panning ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective."" Overall, this movie, I like to fall under the category one of the best films ever made. On my hierarchy of movies, I would put this under ""Worth full price/add this to your DVD collection."" Grade: A+",The Truman Show
454,ammarjamal,One of the greatest films of all time!,8,10 January 2014,"Directed by Peter Weir, The Truman Show is truly an excellent film that explores new ways to engage the viewer, in it's own way it truly catches one's attention as it is one of those rare films that are simple yet very deep. It focuses on Truman Burbank, a man whose life is nothing but a routine. Truman then realizes that everything in his life has been the same, and the story begins to unravel from there...Peter Weir is a great director, he was able to fool the viewer in making us believe that Truman is living in a normal world and not a TV show. He was very successful in making the story evolve around Truman and make us feel the tension between the characters his camera angles were great as he sometimes uses the ""hidden"" cameras that were used in the show, I felt that was very creative.The Truman Show is written by Andrew Niccol who also wrote and directed the very successful Gattaca. He does a great job writing the film as he made the viewer know only what Truman knows and did not have any dramatic irony which I really loved, this helped the story to focus on Truman and develop around him, which made the film much more entertaining. I have to admit, when I watched the first 30 minutes of the film I was lost, I didn't understand anything, but once Truman finds out that his life is fake the viewer finds out with him and suddenly I understood everything. The character development is one of the best thing in The Truman Show, as Truman develops into something totally different than what he was in the beginning of this excellent film.The acting is of coarse amazing, as Jim Carrey does his best ever acting in this film, seeing him happy, sad, angry and dramatic Carrey truly proved himself to be an excellent actor.Overall the Truman Show is an excellent and unique film, it is a must see!!",The Truman Show

I knew that the motion picture of that series failed, and I was a little worried at first. But to my surprise I was blown away! I haven't seen such a bizarre idea be the main story of a film since Transformers ( however that film wasn't good). In bizarre I don't mean dumb or stupid, but more like interesting, and boy is it interesting. This opening is different to most films I've seen, it shows the cast of the actors characters ""acting"" in an interview, which is good because it is already treating itself like a movie, and unlike Truman, they all know they're being watched. In the beginning of the film you get to see lots of product placement, when Truman is saying hello to his neighbors it shows the ideal neighbor, then when Truman meets the twins, one of them pushes him in front of a poster which shows some sort of chicken dinner, later in the day he is in the garden when his lover shows him a brand new kitchen knife and showing all the features like a commercial, and also when your introduced to his best friend who is drinking a beer and says ""now that's a beer"" or something like that. One thing I noticed about this film is that it is very smart, Like when a light falls from the sky they later say that it was a part of an airplane, well since he's always being watched the director can make sure Truman doesn't suspect anything, and I should be more specific in that this director is smart. I saw that this was listed under comedy, which I didn't get at first, but if the point was to be satirical, then it did a perfect job.

But to imagine that this movie was a late 90s movie, i'm sure it must've been life-changing and mind-blowingother than commentary about mass media, the movie also nudges on God-human relationship, and the literal meaning of ""life will get exciting when you step out of your comfort zone and conquer your fear.""i recommend this movie for fun and light entertainment while still being meaningful and great for discussions",The Truman Show
457,dmb1243,Astounding Cinema,10,31 October 1998,"The Truman Show is cinema at its highest pinnacle- it's the sort of film that all others should be judged against. Though its pace is consistent, never reaching fever pitch, its concept is ground breaking and its storyline magnificent. Jim Carrey is Truman Burbank, an ordinary man, living in an ordinary world. At least that's how he defines his world, for unknown to him, he is the star of the world's most popular television show, 'The Truman Show', which has captured on film every second of his thirty year existence. Everyone he knows are actors, every situation that arises is perfectly choreographed. The idea behind The Truman Show is genius, as was the casting of Carrey in the title role. All too often criticised for his slapstick style in movies such as 'Ace Ventura' and 'Dumb and Dumber', Carrey puts on the performance of a lifetime as Burbank, whose life begins to collapse around him. Also of note are performances by Laura Linney as Truman's 'stage' wife who finds it increasingly difficult to cope with Truman's developing ambition to discover life beyond his manufactured world, and by Ed Harris as Christof, who has single-handedly created and moulded Truman's articifial world. The brilliance of The Truman Show is that it works on so many levels, and plays up to man's greatest fear: that his world is not so secure and perfect as it appears. The Truman Show is astounding cinema. See it. Be Thrilled. See it again.",The Truman Show

460,HAL9000-16,A uniquely genuine masterpiece,10,15 June 1999,"Jim Carrey proves to the world that he can do a whole lot more than talk out of his ass, with this brilliantly astonishing performance. He plays Truman Burbank, a normal white collar suburbanite who works in real estate and leads a simple normal life. However, his life is anything but normal. From the moment of his birth, his entire life has been shown on television live and unedited to an audience around the world, the island he lives on is a gigantic sound stage, with close to 5000 cameras, and with the great wall of China is one of two man made structures still visible from space, his wife, best friend, the people he works with, and the people he sees everyday are all just actors. The most amazing thing about this innovative premise is the fact that Truman is completely unaware of all of this. The premise of this film is how he finds out about the reality of his life, and how to escape this prison.The Truman Show is Peter Weir's finest film ever, and the always excellent Ed Harris who plays The Truman Show director, Christof gives his best performance since Glengarry Glen Ross. Jim Carrey gave the best performance that I have seen in 1998, and Laura Linney  provided some comic relief as an over acting actress playing Truman's wife. As the #2 film of 1998 (next to Saving Private Ryan), and one of the 10 greatest films of the 1990's, The Truman Show ranks as one of my top 30 favorite films of all time. This is a film that truly deserves a 5 star rating. Comedy, drama, romance, and even suspense, this film as something for everyone, and is one of those rare films that has something for everyone, it even has an important moral message behind it.

How would you feel finding out that your whole life since you're in your mom's womb has been inside a studio that is created by another man, which has no higher rights at all. Once again, the story is just too unrealistic. Think about it...",The Truman Show
464,overcaffeined,"Great movie, but has inappropriate allegories.",7,14 May 2003,"It's difficult to add new positive comments to The Truman Show. I fully agree with the people who feel it has a strong script, superb art direction, beautiful music, very interesting ideas in the plot, extreme care in the details,... and, yes, Jim Carrey does a great performance, as well as all the actors.However, it suffers a sad weak point: I feel that the allegory of God through Christof (Ed Harris) -an allegory built not from the character name but from some events and scenes in the movie-, is very inappropriate. It's out of context, it happens just as a gag. It would be right if the movie portrayed Christof as someone who believes to be a god (which he does)... however, the movie does an effort going an step beyond, using some typical Christian-like imagery to establish the allegoric parallelism, looking like a God's caricature rather than Christof's.The Truman Show is a great movie.

And the most ironic thing is that they are actually MARKETING their show by showing us ""Truman's Show"" and advertising their ""Steve's show"" all along the movie.I would think that they actually LEARNED something from ""The Truman's Show"".

And it was breath taking.The mere thought of a television show made solely to keep one man imprisoned was horrible, but intriguing at the same time. It made me want to tear apart the producers of the show, but made me watch in curiosity as we were slowly brought into the world of Truman, a 30-something man who sells insurance and has never traveled outside of his hometown. Everything was created for him and him alone, and everyone is trained to keep him unaware of the world outside the world around him.You feel sorry for Truman, want to scream, shout, run into the film and wake him up, but you can't. He is like an unborn baby, unaware that this isn't reality.The cast was incredible, with Carrey delivering his best performance, There's no talking out of his behind, stupid noises or faces. Ed Harris delivers as the TV producer who decided to play God for Truman.The final minutes of ""The Truman Show"" are truly beautiful, masterfully filmed. The music, the lack of dialogue, it brought tears to even my eyes as I was left in wonder at how something like this came to happen, and at what was to happen next. It was shocking, but most of all, it was beautiful.There was no gratuitous violence, language or sex.

But when something happened that triggered his omnipresent curiosity for what lies beyond the boundaries of his hometown, Truman decided he might want to see what actually is the rest of the world like.

Basically, an illusory world is built around a man, simply to entertain viewers who watch the live footage of his life. This concept was so fascinating to me, and is even more ironic today, in that we have phones and are always connected with the outside world.

Well, this code has been broken in the summer release The Truman Show by Jim Carrey.  Yes, the Jim Carrey from The Cable Guy and Ace Ventura 1 & 2.  Though this rule has been broken before (Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting, Awakenings, and Dead Poets Society), but never this well.  In The Truman Show, Truman Burbank (Carrey), the first person to be born on TV is the unsuspecting host of the television show named, simply, ""The Truman Show"" which has sparked ""Trumania"" in the nation.  Truman goes unsuspecting of his certain-to-be-trapped doom in the TV show.  But one day, while heading to work, an object falls from the sky.  He listens to the radio, suspecting the odd, but the DJ's cover it up saying an airliner dropping parts.  Thinking nothing of it, Truman goes on, continuing his life in his little town, while the day, night, weather patterns, and even Truman's life is controlled by one man, Christoff (Harris) AKA, The Creator.  His pleasant life is disrupted, though, after odd things happen, his dead father comes back, a man Truman's never met before knows his name, an elevator has no back to it, etc.  He slowly catches on that his life is not what it seems to be.  With a fabulous Screenplay written by Andrew Niccol (Gattaca) this turns out to be one of those films where after you see it, you come out feeling good and thinking.  What if your world is like that?  Is your world like that?  This movie is definitely Oscar bound, a sure fire nomination for Carrey in his second serious role, his first being in the fabulous made-for-TV-movie Doing Time on Maple Drive. The only snag is in the chance to see a talking butt give an acceptance speech is Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan.  But I still say, Free Truman!

It makes you think differently and expands your awareness and observations made. It was a simple idea , but effective. The film seemed like a dream. It seemed as though Truman was dreaming it all , which has an effect on the audience and makes them feel the same way.This film is quite old, therefore it doesn't seem that realistic. The island in which Truman was living was also quite unrealistic.To improve the movie, the Truman island could have been more realistic so it was harder for him to figure out that it was a show.It would have also helped if his day to day life was a bit more interesting to increase the action and tension levels.

Then, as the movie got further, I started to understand what it was about. I've only seen it once but I plan on watching it again soon. (So sorry if I mess up some things in this review I forgot about some things in the movie.) This movie is about a man named Truman who thinks that his life is simple and boring. He then discovers that his life is actually a TV show. Wow. That's a sad thing to find out.  There are so many things I liked about this movie. I liked that I can really relate to it. There have been times where maybe I thought that what if my life isn't really what I think it is? What if people have hidden secret cameras everywhere I go? Can anyone other than God see me when I use the bathroom or see me when I go to sleep? Another thing I liked about the movie, (if I can remember correctly,) is that Truman never actually gets angry about finding out his life is a TV show. Instead he seems to be trying to curiously figure out why this would be happening to him. He shows the audience that he knows what is going on and seems to be almost challenging them.

I thought it would be a Tv show based off of the title but the creator didn't seem to mind ling to me and the audience. The main issue with this film is that it tries to make you feel sad or happy throughout the movie but it completely lacks emotion. How am I supposed to care about the movie when the characters are so poorly written and unrelatable. The next complaint I have is that the movie never lets the actors get into the role they are supposed to play, and on top of this the movie keeps reminding you that they are just actors and there is no reasoning behind this, I guess the director jut had no idea what he was doing. If you are thinking of watching this do yourself a favor and watch something which is actually good like black mirror.

491,jansen-aui,"Fresh, Original, and All-Together Fascinating",8,18 June 2006,"In an age in motion pictures where heists, explosions, action set pieces, love stories and comic book adaptations dominate the silver screen, it's remarkable to come across a picture as fresh, as original, and as all-together fascinating as The Truman Show, director Peter Weir's part drama, part comedy, part social commentary on the nature of television and one's right to privacy and a normal life.Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is an ordinary man, good natured and kind to all, who lives a sweet life of bliss in Seahaven where he works for an insurance company. He has a nice place, good neighbours, and a loving wife (Laura Linney), but what he doesn't have is any knowledge that everybody he's ever known is an actor, that those he doesn't know are extras and that Seahaven is a concealed dome: a giant stage in Los Angeles. He has no idea and that every second of every day of his life has been recorded by over 5,000 carefully placed cameras and broadcast to the entire world. He's the star of the Truman Show, the first unwanted child legally adopted by a corporation. When a figure from his traumatic past revisits him on the streets of Seahaven, Truman begins to notice a series of strange occurrences that offer clues of his actual existence. I suppose it's an inevitability that Truman will eventually discover the truth, it's not the film's best kept secret, but the way in which it all occurs to him is certainly more than half the fun.In all his films, Jim Carrey has never put in a performance so composed and articulate as he does in The Truman Show  possessing just the right amounts of humour and innocence necessary for Truman Burbank. In some ways, he's even funnier than he can be with any number of the over-the-top faces he has in his comedic arsenal. Ed Harris, as the show's creator and director Christof, has a small role but delivers well, and the scene where he and Truman finally speak like man and God is terrific.There's nothing flashy in the production of Weir's documentary-style approach to The Truman Show, bar a few well-composed shots from various hidden cameras in Seahaven. What he achieves is effective, though, in the way he proposes that what society can be so engrossed in  of all things  is an ordinary man living an ordinary life, that we are willing to accept the complete sacrifice, even if not in a literal sense, of a man's entire life for the sake of entertainment. It's what makes The Truman Show ultimately so interesting for the audience, who watch it as beings even higher than Christof. It's so captivating that I felt a little dissatisfied at the end of the picture, having wanted more of Truman, more of behind- the-scenes, more of the same monotony. If it weren't for the story feeling a little too rushed before it was all over, The Truman Show could have been even more deep, felt, and enjoyable than it was, but that being said, it is an excellent and highly original motion picture.",The Truman Show

Truman Show may well outlast his other work.The director wisely avoided too many closeups on Carrey's famous mobile face. Carrey uses his wholse self to act out his anguish, joy, other emotion. His eyes, from a slight distance show his emotion..the other supporting actors are good at their minor trickery - The false ""god"" of Carrey's universe is played well by Ed Harris.

495,xboy614,Truman Show is a wonderful piece of cinema,10,30 July 2013,"Peter Weir has casted well-known comedians into serious roles before with Robin Williams starring in Dead Poet's Society. We had to study this film in English and I actually got quite excited. This is an astounding movie and is done so well. Jim Carrey plays the main character, Truman Burbank (True-Man). Truman lives what he thinks is a normal life. He has a wife, a home, a friend he's known for most of his life and a desk-job at an insurance agency. What he doesn't realize is that he is actually a star in a 24 hour, live show which is showed all across the globe which documents like a soap-opera his life.The whole film tackles the themes of the power of the media and even religious themes about the God if you look hard enough as Truman starts to realize that his life is different from everyone around him. The script is more than perfect, the dialogue is wonderful and there is an excellent mix of heart-warming stuff as well as some comedy to lighten the mood (a necessity). The film is not too long, which is a good thing because a considerable length for a movie like this could ruin it. The acting is another stand-out along-side the excellent script. Jim Carrey does a great job and I can see how they casted him instead of another normal actor (Yes, Jim, you're not a normal actor). All the actors do a good job but keep an eye out for the man who plays Truman's friend, Marlon, who does amazing and a few scenes you would see why. There's nothing more I can really say about this film, it's thought-provoking, it's wonderfully scripted and acted. It has a few funny scenes to lighten the mood but overall its serious. I must say that it is not a popcorn film but it is also a film which is worth more than one viewing. Watch it twice in a week and you will understand a bit more of the themes and nuances which help create this world. This is the type of movie which really leaves an impression on you after you watch it.

It's an allegory on the influence of the media. How films and TV shows and adverts are packaged and manipulated by those who are in a position to do so. The message is strengthened here by Carrey's performance (at a time when he was not known for 'dramatic' roles) and the character of Truman himself who gives the film it's emotional weight. We want to see Truman escape this world that he has been essentially trapped inside, as do the audience of the show as we see them in the film. However they also want their show to continue.

In fact in Germany they had a Big Brother format in which they had a whole village as their ""Big Brother house"". The main difference to this movie being that the contestants naturally knew that they were on a TV-show (but what if they had had babies?).So basically this movie is not so original anymore. Except for the concept, the plot is pretty thin actually. As most Jim Carrey movies, this one relies a lot on his skills.

500,Sisko H.,An opponent for Saving Private Ryan,8,15 November 1998,"This film has a very good chance to win the famous Academy Award for the best movie. I think this film is a possibility to see like huge the power of the television is. Of course, the story is too unrealistic, however you watch some very important facts of the television, which are included in our TV programme. For example ""commercials"". Ed Harris plays his role so realistically, that I think he owns a TV station or he´s a producer. In the movie he fells like a god over a small world. He is ruling over this small town and its inhabitants. If you want watch a very funny and intellectual movie, THE TRUMAN SHOW is the best movie for a long time.",The Truman Show
501,Jim-249,a Sci-fi Parable that would have been more effective if it had been pitched somewhat higher.,7,18 January 1999,"A film that provokes thought is always welcome; this entertained and at the same time created certain unforgettably disturbing scenes - as one would expect from a director of this calibre. I'm grateful for that, but when I found myself asking why it hadn't grabbed me as powerfully as some of Weir's other films, I realized that he hadn't really made me CARE what happened to Truman - I could see the horror of the idea, but I felt no real emotional link to the hero. It's significant that IMDb categorizes the film as ""Drama/Romance"". Romance? That side of the film (= his emotional life) flopped completely, perhaps because the real climax of the film is the revelation of Christof's up-in-space studio: the focus of the film switches totally  to the Evil Film-maker and we succumb to the glitter of high-tech film-making, even if we're supposed to be as frightened as we once were by Big Brother. Why were we not shown the full impact of the reunion with his ""father""? (What on earth would they have said to each other? What pain/joy would Truman have known?) And why are we not shown the wife walking out? (We're told that it happened. What pain must that have caused!) This sort of gap left the protagonist too one-dimensional - which is a great pity, because the parable is a powerful one, worthy of our full involvement.Was the casting of  Jim Carey responsible? Much as I like him, he seemed far too happy and 'normal' for a product of such an upbringing. There could be no existential angst in such a chirpy grinner (though he did try). Would someone with the permanently perplexed expression of a Harrison Ford have fitted better? Interesting, because then it would have been heavier, less amusing. Amusing? Was it a comedy, then? Perhaps there's a genre-confusion here, too! Comedy/Drama/Romance?  It was  really a Sci-fi Parable that would have been more effective if it had been pitched somewhat higher. (I was interested to see that, though its publicity attracted youngsters, the large majority of those I  talked to - I'm a teacher  -  didn't enjoy it at all.)",The Truman Show

504,andy67uk,Brilliant performance from Jim Carrey!,9,6 January 2002,"Jim Carrey is to 'The Truman Show' what James Stewart is to 'It's a Wonderful Life' - completely indispensable. Carrey's great performance as Truman, a man predestined to be an eternal innocent and denied the full knowledge of how his circumstances came to be, makes this film. In spite of an over-the-top 'Twilight Zone' style plot, this film has more to say about the 'human condition' (and is far superior) than 'Good Will Hunting' which aspires to the loftier heights of 'realism'.The cruel director, played by Ed Harris, is not a million miles away from the so-called 'fly-on-the-wall' documentary directors, who manipulate real people and pepper our screens with tedious, victim based documentaries which claim to be great social insights. Carrey's portrayal of the innocent Truman has great pathos and a touching quality. In being denied the truth about his real existence, Truman is unknowingly imprisoned in a childlike existence that he has never had the opportunity to shape for himself.Carrey's brilliant performance wins the audiences' sympathy when he finds out the reality of his 'constructed' existence and tries to break free from this cruel manipulation and tyranny. What makes this film stand out today is that it is one of the few films of recent times, based around the theme of personal liberty. When there is so much false theorising in the real world about what constitutes 'liberty' and we are being told that fewer liberties is a new consequence of fighting a 'war for civilisation', it is refreshing to watch a film that is funny, entertaining and wholly sympathetic to the idea of personal freedom.",The Truman Show
505,Smoothfox,A truly beautiful film,9,11 October 2001,"How  Jim Carrey didn't get an Oscar for this is a mystery to me. Given the power, I would let this would sweep the board. Like all classics, there are many levels, and subtleties that I am always finding (The Sting is another fine example): so much in the background, and the film has a consistent tone of both cynicism and optimism (You can read it as one man beats the system, or the inevitable point that reality TV will one day reach...remember this preceded the craze!) The actors are all spot on, esp. the background actors who manage to switch on command, providing an eerie Prisoner-esque environment. And of course, if I could nominate a set for best Actor, Seahaven wins hands down. Excellent work all round guys! ""A thing of beauty is a joy forever"" John Keats",The Truman Show
506,charambo,"its like the TV series the prisoner, but Truman does not hes in a prison",2,29 September 2005,"Thye whole point of the film is that Truman is the only one who is unaware that since his birth he has been on TV, and that all the other people are actors. Truman is married, did he ever have sex with his wife or ids he still a virgin. When he sees children walking about, did he not wonder where they came from. Or did he he sex with his actress wife? This above all else is what spoils the story completely for me. He never wanted to go on holiday to France, or to Hawaii? He never once wanted to leave town? Find out who his real parents were if possible. Lastly why would any government, especially the USA let this type of thing happen? Its totally against human rights, and everyone involved with the project should have been put in jail. Hype made this picture popular, and some high brow reviewers.",The Truman Show

510,Shnorg2342,The Truman Show- an extremely touching film,10,9 December 2019,"The Truman Show is a beautiful film that I've seen countless times. It stars Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, a man who has no idea that his life is being secretly filmed and broadcast to the entire world on TV (hence the title).
Plot: Truman is an average insurance salesman, with a pretty wife whom he doesn't really love, a fairly large house, and a working class best friend. He's an average upper middle class American. Truman starts to catch on to the fact that something isn't right with his life, because everything's right with his life. It all starts when he sees what he believes to be his supposedly dead father, who was written off of the show when Truman was little. The creator wrote him off as a death at sea, which Truman witnessed as a child, so he's be scared enough to stay on the large island TV set. Truman's determination that he saw his father, alive and well leads him to discover how lots of little things are just slightly off about his life. This crisis leads him to a point near insanity.
My thoughts: I'll start with Jim Carrey. Carrey absolutely shines in this role, which was really his first role that wasn't in a wacky comedy. He is very average and relatable, which makes it all the more sad when things start to go wrong (or right, depending on your view) for him. He is fantastically heartbreaking in the final scene, where after riding a boat through the sea, reaches the wall and talks to the creator of the show, Christoph. Christoph is very much a god figure to Truman, since he has controlled every aspect of his life up until now. The movie is incredibly entertaining, and provides a wide range of emotions, from laughter, to nostalgia, to heartbreak. It has some great comedy lines, like ""What's it going to be Meryl, are you gunna slice me, dice me, or peel me?! There are so many choices, aren't there!"" but it also as some genuinely tragic moments, like when it's revealed that the woman Truman really loves was taken away, because she wasn't part of the script, and when Truman reaches the wall and is pounding on it, trying to find some way, any way, to escape. At one point while he's on the boat, Christoph contemplated killing Truman with a storm, and even attempts it, and Truman seems absolutely fine with this. He'd rather die than be confined. The movie also has a very nice message about doing what makes you happy, even when it doesn't conform with your supposed destiny. Overall a fantastic, touching film, and one of the films that got me into movies in the first place at that. I can't think of a single flaw. 10/10",The Truman Show

512,marine-3,Entertaining Interlude,7,27 January 1999,"I am not a Jim Carrey fan.  His performance on one of the MTV award shows a few years ago was a prime motivator in my having that channel removed from my cable service.  I rented ""The Truman Show"" at the urging of my teenage son - what a pleasant surprise!  Carrey CAN act when not behaving like an ass.  Very entertaining & thoughtful movie.  Certainly gives one second thoughts as to just how much television intrudes into all our lives - shades of ""1984"" - not too far away folks!  If we're not careful.Sterling Ed Harris, as always.I was disappointed, however, not to see the reunion between Truman & Sylvia. But then the human/true/real aspect would have clouded the entire concept, perhaps.

513,nadijaherdwina,Makes me think about digital addiction,9,5 November 2020,"Honestly, I was a little bit confused at first because I thought the show was airing with Truman's consent. As soon as I realize it wasn't, I couldn't stop thinking how stressful it is living in a world like his. Imagine realizing that no one is on your side even when you're on your lowest point. And looking at those TV addicts, it still distressingly relatable to current conditions where everyone is addicted to social media (lowkey self-reflection).

515,Perelandra,"Oh, wow. Oh, no. Oh, help.",10,4 March 2002,"(Possible Spoilers)How they did it I do not know, but The Truman Show is practically perfect. From the opening credits where the members of the 'cast' discuss their 'roles', to that unforgettable scene where Truman walks across the horizon, to the very end (not telling, go see it!), it captures you.  Jim Carrey is wonderful and Ed Harris is perfect, and I love all the special camera angles from unlikely places (ie. Truman's rear-view mirror and people's buttons). The amputation scene in the hospital, the scene where Truman stops the traffic (wow!) and the love scene between Truman and Sylvia are all totally captivating.  In fact, the more I remember it the more things I know I'll never forget.""What are you gonna do- grate me, slice me or dice me?  There are sooo many choices!"" Or how about the lines of villagers marching through the town searching for Truman?  Who could forget, ""Cue the sun!""?  Or the scene where Truman is reunited with his father, with appropriate musical score, lighting and camera work for the viewers' benefit?  What about the women's magazines and the badge with ""HOW IS IT GOING TO END?"" on it?  Or the posters on the wall of the flight centre?A great achievement of the movie is that it made you think.  In fact, you CAN'T ignore it.  As well as going around for a week thinking you're on candid camera, you'll find yourself wondering more and more about Truman. What happened to him?  Did he and Sylvia find each other?  How did they manage to build such a large set in the first place?  Was the marriage to his wife legal?  Did she audition, did she get time off?  Why did Marlon's parents let him act in the Truman Show ever since he was small?  How did they make him keep it secret?  Did he even know right from the beginning? Did Truman's mother really love him?  What if a tornado had knocked down the set?  Did Truman have a chance to learn religious education?  Did they ever make it rain on the day of the school picnic?  What technique of discipline did his mother use as an example to the world, and did it work? You know, that kind of thing.The scariest part of The Truman Show, however, is that the movie is very nearly coming true.  Watch it, and you'll never be able to watch Temptation Island or Flatmates or Big Brother again- unless you are absolutely beneath contempt, of course...",The Truman Show
516,dereklarma,A film that surprised me and became one of my favorites!!!,10,15 August 2007,"The Truman Show stars Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, an accountant that lives in a small town called Seahaven. Truman thinks of himself as an ordinary guy. He is married, has a house, has a decent job, and has a decent life. Little does Truman know that he lives in a world created around him. Truman is the star of a TV show broadcasted around the world. His own life is on display for the world to see. In the film Truman becomes suspicious of the world around him. Events occur that baffle him. Truman knows something strange is going on but does not know what.Christoff, played by Ed Harris, is the creator of the show. As you watch the film you see that boundaries have been set for Truman. At a young age Truman was discouraged by everyone to not explore. Of course, being that it is a TV show everyone is an actor or actress, his mom and dad, his best friend, his wife, and everyone he sees on the streets everyday is a professional actor or actress. Truman's whole enviorment is fake and scripted except for himself. He doesn't even have a real father or mother. Truman was a test-tube baby. His life is controlled. Its almost like he has been enslaved. Truman's own enviorment is not even real. The entire town and area he lives in is inside a huge dome. The sun, moon, wind, rain, and clouds is all fake. Christoff plays God and controls Truman's life.Truman progresses through the film. He begins to notice that strange things are happening around him. Things he can't explain. He knows his wife does not love him and he notices that everything seems to be repeating itself like a routine. Everyday seems the same. Nothing changes. During the film Truman conquers his fears and breaks through barriers that he nor did Christoff think was possible.This was definitely Jim Carey's best performance of his career. He plays this serious role very well and at the same time adds a little zest to the character that no one else can do. Jim Carey is very good at showing emotions which was needed in this film.This film also tackled the possible future of entertainment. During the film there are random clips of people watching Truman on TV. People laugh and cry with Truman as they watch. But as a viewer of the film you want to curse at Christoff and all those people who watch the show because you feel sympathy for Truman. You as the viewer start to care about Truman. As you watch the film you want Truman to find out what has been going on.The film had great directing, great cinematography, great acting, and great music. Everything in this film flowed very well. The initial plot grabbed me and the great acting and writing sealed the deal. I would call this film a border-line masterpiece.If you are a fan of Jim Carey or if you want to see a great film, then look no further and watch The Truman Show.",The Truman Show
517,pearl_girl79,I love this film.,8,30 April 2003,"I think this is a fantastic film. It is one of my favorites. I think it is funny, touching and even sad. You can't help but feel badly for poor Truman when he starts discovering things aren't what they seem. I think my absolute favorite line in this movie is from Christof when he said ""Cue the sun"". Sure, maybe its impossibly expensive to build an entire town inside a sphere and create a TV show about a persons life without them knowing it. But when was the last time you saw the Star Ship Enterprise (or Voyager) flying over earth ? Its a great fantasy movie, thats all it is. The acting in this movie is superb, especially that of Jim Carry and Ed Harris. Ed Harris' character is so evil, the way he thinks he knows what's best for Truman. One line he says ""I am the creator...(pause)....of a television show that brings hope and joy to millions"" Its almost as if he has a God complex. Well, I think he does. I have to wonder, if such a show actually aired, where a persons life was on the air 24/7 from infancy to adult, would we actually watch it ?",The Truman Show
518,elmokenthos,It could be better,5,7 November 2020,"Seriously, this could be better. I like the idea, until it became ridiculous. The set was in a secluded area, it's a dome, it's not an open world, so people who enter the dome should be checked, not to mention those who were on the camera. So, the woman (Truman's lover, forget her name), shouldn't even be in the set, but her being in the set, and able to speak to Truman for so long, it's just stupid. Yes, eventually her 'father' got rid of her. But it shouldn't happen in the first place. And remember the one who parachuted himself into the set? How can he did that, it's a dome, it's not an open world! So stupid!!! Truman didn't act by script, so it's another stupid thing to make others act by script.

Some parts are comical, others are suspenseful, and some are just touching. The audience cheers Truman on his journey toward discovery. One of the reasons why Truman is such a great protagonist is because he is so relatable. I mean just in my life I can think of numerous ways that I relate to the character. Sometimes I feel like everyone is watching me. Some days I'll continuously look over my shoulder expecting some nutball to be standing behind me waiting to slash me up with an axe. I started carrying a hatchet with me everywhere I go now for protection. I have had continued suspicion that my wife is out to get me. Sometimes I catch her spying on me throughout the day. She tells me I'm being paranoid but I know what she's up to. She's out to get me, I just know it. She'll rue the day she crosses me.I also caught myself relating to the Truman Show audience. Sometimes I can become extremely nosy and invasive into other people's lives. I have several of my friends' e-mail passwords, and I have made a hobby out of checking out their plans and what they're buying online. I have been kicked out of restrooms countless times for peering into the cracks in the bathroom stalls.All in all, though, this film is pretty spectacular.

524,Pupkin-2,One of the greats of 90's cinema,9,12 October 1998,"The Truman Show is an exceptional piece of cinema, it is mainly a media satire with beautiful subtle surreal touches  (notice how Truman lives in a 50's world of gadgets) but it also has a strong human element without ever sinking into sentementaliy.  This human element is due  to Carrey who against odds has turned in a terrific performance here - definitely Oscar standard.The director Peter Weir who i have always thought was talented but not ""top league"" with Scorsese, Kubrick etc has made a film exceeding anything we have seen for a long time from anybody. This film has got to go down as one of  if not the very best movie of the decade, it may sound like I'm over hyping but if there is a wrong note in this film then I fail to see it",The Truman Show

On a basic level, we have a serious Jim Carrey film, which deals with deception and creation. But though watching this film we find that it is so much more than that. We have elements of humour, satire and quite a few jabs at present day media practices, i.e. turning ordinary' people into celebrities, through the medium of television, evident in British shows such as Airport and Hotel.This is done on a much grander scale though, with all Truman's life being turned into a television show. What interests me most about this film is the way in which the 5000+ cameras are represented on screen that film Truman on a day-to-day basis, and how products are plugged on air'.In my opinion, ranking up alongside Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' as one of best films of 1998, The Truman Show will soon become regarded as a modern classic.",The Truman Show

This is better than anything I've seen on the Twilight Zone. This was absolute heart stopping action, from start to finish. I couldn't believe how fast my adrenaline was pumping or how hard my heart was beating. This obviously isn't a James Bond flick or a movie with Mel Gibson.

To keep someone in a place and intrude on their life is not in my mind good viewing but evil. Ed Harris' character should have been arrested for kidnapping not given awards. I thought Carrey's acting was just the same as the rest of his stuff just toned down slightly. The ending was totally implausible and unbelievable. I do not have one nice thing to say about this film, all Truman's co-workers obviously were too greedy to see what they were doing was wrong.

So I endured a second viewing.  The third time was another very long story that I won't even get into.  The 5 times I've seen this movie I enjoyed it every time.  Jim Carey really is an actor!  I was amazed at how unike the story was.  No story I had ever seen had come up with an original plot idea like this one.  Laura Linney was great as Jim's ""Wife.""  Ed Harris also did well as an insane creator of The Truman Show.  This movie all together had something.  It had a sort of ""feel-good"" yet ""sad"" yet sometimes ""funny"" attitude.  The film breathed ideas.  Could a person really live in a place like this.  The movie demonstrated how corrupt network executives could be.  Ed Harris almost tried to kill Carey.  Overall I think this movie is definetly going to be a classic.8/10",The Truman Show
534,curtisloew,Psyhcologically brilliant...Deep and Moving,8,15 February 2008,"Jim Carrey can more commonly be found portraying the eccentric characters in films...from The Grinch, to Ace Ventura. Placed as Truman Burbank, however, Carrey is given a more poignant role, to which he does more than justice. Through his immaculate characterisation this film makes the audience feel as though he is also watching 'The Truman Show.' What perhaps makes the film so interesting and deep is the moving relationships that Truman experiences, something that Carrey brings across greatly.Most of the film made me thinking about the possibility and actuality that is posed by the director. Indeed, it seems that there is much philosophical debate about matters such as those addressed in the film, giving a graphic representation of what a human being experiences throughout his life. Truman's realisation and 'wanting to break free' also seems to be a reflection of typical personal experience when we run into trouble...however, Truman alone has this power.Overall a stunning film that presents deep issues and a valuable message, with fantastic performances...a top film!",The Truman Show
535,Bondek,Terribly underrated,10,26 May 2006,"My friends and I agree that this film is underrated to many. It came out roughly in the same time as EDtv so there are comparisons made. However, as in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Carrey demonstrates his skills as an actor. A straight actor and to be honest, I prefer Carrey in Truman Show and ESOTSM and even Man In The Moon to his comic performances. A funny man he is but unlike say, Bill Murray (a fave of mine nonetheless), Carrey can make the change from funny to straight easily. Watch this film and question life itself. Like The Prisoner and other such things it can throw up some questions. The whole Big Brother angle on life and what-have-you but mostly just watch this for a drastically underrated performance by Carrey.",The Truman Show
536,billmullaney,How Do We Know What's Real and True?,6,6 May 2021,"This isn't an original question. Plato raised it many many centuries ago in his Allegory of the Cave. The Truman Show takes on the question in a somewhat novel and entertaining way, but the movie really doesn't reach any meaningful or profound conclusions. So it's not clear why so many reviewers are treating the movie as if it is a cinematic masterpiece. This is a mildly entertaining movie which is worth seeing if you haven't seen it. But I believe too many of the reviews here are overstating how good this movie really is.",The Truman Show
537,cvairag,One of the Greatest Films Ever Made - A Masterpiece by Any Standard,10,12 July 2013,"One of the few Hollywood produced films that WILL stand the test of time as ART - high ART - I'm talk'in Ugetsu, Ikiru, Seventh Seal - the rarefied air - the 'I've been to the mountaintop' of cinematic art...Now - what happened with the public reception? Many of our nation's best critics realized to one extent or another how great the film was - perhaps not as much its prophetic nature - which, if you saw it originally in the theater - you might try viewing it again - to see.The featured review is on the right track. 1998 was a bumper crop year for Hollywood film - yet, few in Hollywood seemed to realize it. True, Carry's goofy reputation, if somewhat deserved, caused many to miss the point - but, at the end of the day, all of the latent denial in the American psyche - specifically catered to by the Hollywood elite - produced the most blatant Oscar night debacle in a long history of this tragically repeated motif - great art once again denied the laurel wreath in deference to crass commercialism - in this case two of the greatest English language films ever made, The Truman Show and American History X, shunted in favor of a shameless piece of fluff based on dubious if not downright dishonest premises, Joseph Fiennes' vaunted backside, and the rather gauchely revolting nepotistic spectacle of Gwynnie dancing with Daddy...Truly, the American public really did not get The Truman Show - it got by most of us - perhaps, it requires repeated viewings - such an incisive critique of the American psyche as it is - where even the most sacred things are trampled under our incessant self-created need for security and the lies we're willing to tell ourselves to perpetuate it. The final conversation between Truman and his life-long 'friend', Marlin, is imo one of the greatest scenes ever filmed - revealing the depth of the corruption of our wayward civilization - enough to make Dostoyevsky's Grand Inquisitor blush with shame.Weir has made a number of very good+++ films: Dead Poets Society, Last Wave, Witness... but...THIS IS HIS MATERPIECE A FILM ONE SHOULD SEE AGAIN AND AGAIN.

If you've never seen this movie you need to see it. It's not a comedy but it's not the drama exactly. It's life pure and simple life and the Awakening to the fact that maybe it's not what you thought it was. Maybe it's a commentary on midlife crisis cease or maybe it's a commentary on the modern-day prevalence of reality TV. You could take it either way or you can take it for what it is.

540,ethanmidd,Completely Original,8,7 February 2015,"How this movie is shot is so interesting. There are many first person shots and just the angles throughout the film are different compared to a normal film. Weir did a good job on giving a well mixture between comedy and suspense/drama. There were moments that made me laugh and moments that kept really engaged with what was happening to Truman. That's also just good writing so kudos to Andrew Niccol.The costume design and set is very interesting. The costumes give the set of the city a vintage era, but it's the 90s obviously. Also just the set in general, imagine the set of Edward Scissorhands but not as creepy. Also, the music is fantastic. It's not original but it is an enjoyable sound for your ears.It's a movie that I finally got to see and it made me happy. Truman Show is a film that will not disappoint audiences with its great editing, music, acting, and everything else overall. Only grouch is that I wish there was a bit more to the ending. Five more minutes would have been great. Despite that, Truman Show is a film I definitely plan on seeing again and again.",The Truman Show

542,iollann,The Truman Show review,8,24 March 2017,"Directed by Paul Weir, starring Jim Carrey, Ed Harris and Laura Linney, 'The Truman Show' is a satirical comedy-drama about an insurance salesman who discovers his whole life is a television show. Released in 1998 the main character 'Truman Burbank' played by Jim Carrey is perfectly summed up in the films tag line: 'On the Air. Unaware'. Jim Carrey obviously steals the show with it being centred on him with a genuine serious role instead of his usual crude, wacky, comedy self like in 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective'. Truman is an insurance salesman living a lie. Unbeknownst to Truman he is the star of the biggest television program in the world. Everybody he knows are actors. He lives in a town inside a studio with cameras everywhere. The character of Truman is easy to like as he is honest and easy to sympathize with as he is a good man. Jim Carrey suits Truman in the sense that he is versatile. In parts Truman can act a bit manic and in others he is quite serious and emotional. This plays into Jim Carrey's hands because he is, as I've said surprisingly versatile. Ed Harris has a very good performance as a supporting actor playing 'Christof' the creator of the television program 'Truman has been trapped in. The best part of Harris' portrayal of 'Christof' is that you are not sure if he wants to help 'Truman' and believes he is helping 'Truman' or if he is doing this for himself, for his ego, money and overall fame. In my opinion, the films deeper meaning is that we have to question news and we can't be trapped in this fabricated world that reality television and the idolization of celebrities like 'the Kardashians' that the media has made. In short, there's a whole other world outside of your television, laptop or phone screen. That is why I feel this film is extremely relevant today because of people being constantly on their phones. In conclusion the Truman show is an extremely thought provoking film, Jim Carrey's performance anchors the film and the deeper message of the film is relevant in today's society. Overall I give it an 8 out of 10.",The Truman Show
543,scottishrose,Amazing... simply amazing...,10,25 March 2006,"That's all I can say after watching this movie. I just finished it not five minutes ago, and... the things I am feeling are beyond description. By the end, I was sitting enraptured on my couch, staring unblinkingly at the events happening on my screen. I began to feel so insignificant, so small, like my life was equivalent to that of a housefly. It felt... so strange.This was definitely, DEFINITELY a 10/10 film. Pure wonder on all counts. In fact, I'm beginning to wonder why I'm writing this review, as it seems unlikely that I'll meet the ten-line minimum. There is simply nothing I can say, except for amazing. Amazing. Amazing.I can't even begin to imagine the moment of reality. The moment when you realise that your entire life has been scripted, has been surrounding you. The moment when you realise that your life is nothing but a thing of entertainment. There is no originality. Everything is planned... It must feel so unbelievable, unthinkable, incredible, inconceivable. These are only a few of the adjectives there are to describe that mind-boggling feeling.If you haven't seen this film, I absolutely and completely urge you to do so. Your life as you know it will change forever.",The Truman Show
544,danieltracy,The Truman Show Review,10,25 August 2018,That rare cinematic experience a movie so close to pure perfection that it seems a shame to spoil it by even reading a review beforehand.,The Truman Show
545,calderonp8,And in case I don't see you ...,9,27 April 2020,"The Truman Show is a film about a man who lives in this ""perfect"" world, has the ""perfect life"" and the ""perfect"" wife. This man was this life because he lives in a television show, unknowingly. Almost everything about this movie is great, the amazing acting, the script and the plot. The one thing about the film that I thought could have been a little different was the ending. Even though you kind of understand that Truman and Lauren will be reunited, I would have liked it if we actually saw that. Throughout the film, as Truman starts to uncover that the truth about his life I started to think about his actually imperfect life. While some people would say they'd be happy living in this world ignorantly, imagine this. Nothing you have experienced is real, nothing, your wedding was a fabrication for a large TV audience, your wife doesn't love you, hell even your parents are actors. In this discussion I feel like it's just not fair for Truman, while he eventually escapes from the massive set that is his home, what does he actually have in the real world? At the end Christof is trying to convince Truman to stay, by saying that here he has the perfect life and is free from the horror of the real world. When Christoff says ""We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented."" I believe this is pretty true. Sometimes we wish that our reality would change, such as in these trying times, but we know that we can't do anything about it so we simply try to accept it. While people will always try to fight a reality that they dislike, most will soon simply try to accept it and move on with their lives. In every reality there is something, even if it's very small that we can take away. For example, right now I believe that we can all learn new things at home, and when it's over we'll come out better. While of course there are aspects of the real world that are not very good, it's still real. It's better than any fake life, just as Truman realizes at the very end. The film itself is just amazing, the story is something very original that had a powerful message but still remained very interesting to watch. Jim Carrey's acting is just superb, how you can feel his emotions and his weaknesses. In the film, there are some funny moments in which characters suddenly pause and literally advertise a product. This was funny, but I think it's also an analogy on how every day of our lives we are thrown with so much ads everywhere so we buy things that we don't really need. There were some unrealistic things in the movie, such as how the show would get so many viewers during the first years of Truman's life, I mean I just feel like that would be pretty boring to watch, but maybe that's just me. The other thing is that supposedly the ginormous set is built in Hollywood, but jeez that real state must have been ridiculously expensive. While I get why they did it there, it would have been more realistic if they built it somewhere other that was cheaper. Also at the very very end when the two security guards are watching the Truman Show and when they see Truman leaving, they're like, ""Well we watch something else?"" This was a pretty funny way of showing the reality, like many people try to watch so many things that they can't fully get the essence of what they watched. In Christof's eyes, he is God in this world he has created, but to everyone against the Truman Show, such as Lauren he is a villain. For the media and the people who just love the show he is someone very special though. In conclusion, I felt like this film was greatly crafted, had strong acting, an original plot and real life issues that we should all think about in some way.",The Truman Show
546,Novelty,A miracle,10,30 September 1999,"(Warning: might include spoilers!)At first, I wasn't especially interested in seeing The Truman Show. I thought: how can a movie starring Jim Carrey be any good? After all, he made The Cable Guy one of the worst ever movies. Little did I know that Carrey would contribute in making The Truman Show one of my all-time favorite movies!Truman Show has one of the most nuanced and subtle scripts I've come across. The story simply nails you to your seat. Directing is brilliant, thanks to master-director Peter Weir, also responsible for the stunning Dead Poets Society. Here, Weir re-creates the world in which Truman Burbanks lives and is being (involuntarily) filmed 24 hours a day. Peter Weir actually places us there, on the spot next to Truman, shares us Truman's feelings and thoughts.We laugh as he laughs, and we cry along with him. Towards the end of the film, we sense Truman's despair and hopelessness deep inside of us, even though we already know all about his situation. The reason for this is that Weir manages to make Truman represent mankind. Truman could be any one of us.The Truman Show is a movie playing on many levels at once. It has humor and drama. It concerns our need for entertainment and reveals an increasingly shameless media-industry (""the first channel to adopt a child.""), as well as  man's fight and struggle to break out of tediousity and distress; basically   our need for freedom.There are so many details here: the pin with the words ""how is it going to end?"", the various ways Truman is being kept at Seahaven (the preventive posters at the travel agency has to be seen to be believed)... And notice how Christof falls forward at the end, as if he had lost everything, even his own life, the very moment Truman gained his.Acting is flawless. From the ""acting actors"" - Laura Linney as Truman's wife and Noah Emmerich as his best friend Marlon - to Ed Harris as Christof, along with Christof's companions. Harris carries out a truly awesome performance, he steals every scene. And finally: Jim Carrey is magnificent as Truman   Burbanks (from the Burbanks galaxy : ) He does everything right. He is goofy when it's called for, and genuinely moving and emotional at other times. I can't think of a better actor to portray Truman's everyday life.I've seen The Truman Show six times now, and I will buy the home video cassette and put it on my shelf. This is an utter perfect movie, and one of my five favorite movies of all time.",The Truman Show
547,Henry-19,Rave,10,13 October 1998,"Marvellous. As a Jim Carrey hater, I found his performance in this  film to be a revelation.

548,Matt0518,If this were a REAL tv show I wouldn't watch it,3,3 December 1999,"and since it's a movie I felt ripped off.

I finally caught the whole thing on video - and believe it didn't improve with age.",The Truman Show
549,Matches-5,Provocative and inspiring,10,15 November 1998,"Most praise that The Truman Show gets is truly deserved.  It is one of the most provocative and inspiring movies of this decade and perhaps all time.The concept of this movie is one that many of us have thought before about our own lives.  What if this is just a set-up?  What if everyone in my life is just acting, playing a big joke, on ME?  This concept, coupled with brilliant screenplay, cinematography, and acting makes The Truman Show a definite winner.Particularly notable is Jim Carrey, proving once and for all that he is not just a rubber-faced slapstick actor, but can really give a character a personality.  Ed Harris is powerful again as Christof, the creator of ""The Truman Show.""One of the largest gripes about this movie is its ending, and those reading this who don't want to know should stop right here.There are complaints that the writers left the audience hanging, that the audience wants to know:  What happens to Truman?  What happens with his true love, what happens to Christof?  Many people call this the downfall of the effect of the movie, but I find it to be one of the truest and most provocative aspects of it.  The reason that we do not see what happens to Truman, is because we are no longer seeing the ""Truman Show.""  When he steps out of that door, we are no longer privy to what is, after all, HIS life. Why didn't the writers write out a more fulfilling ending for Truman? Because his life ISN'T written out for him anymore.  No longer is he subject to what others feels he should do.  He, and we, are freed with his final step through that door.",The Truman Show

552,Dr_Cool,When reality can be more shocking than fiction...,8,23 November 2002,"I liked Truman Show, although, in some weird sense, it made me feel quite uncomfortable at times. Only Truman and his true love, Sylvia, deserve to be called human beings in this story. The actors, producers and the audience are the true puppets here. I sympathize with Truman's search for truth, but in the end I can feel only pity for him, knowing that he had to live almost an entire artificial life. Anyway, despite the uncomfortable feeling, and despite the lack of humanity of the audience, who can live only through Truman's life (this is by the way the most shocking part of the movie, which most accurately represents reality, particularly now with all those reality shows out there), I thought it was very good. The end was particularly satisfactory and well stitched. The final scene with the guards was very symbolic: Truman's true drama, even with a happy conclusion, had been planned to be just another big fiction, and ends exactly like that: just another mass-consumption show among so many. A very strong message under the skin of what, I suppose, can be seen by some insensitive souls as a superficial just-for-fun fiction.",The Truman Show
553,solidsnake8706,A VERY ORIGINAL MOVIE,10,2 September 2000,"Most movies nowadays have plots that have been down many times before. The Truman show is a new idea. It's a very good movie. It's jokes are more subtle, that aren't really that funny when you are watching the movie for the first time, but when you think back about it you realize how absurd some of the situations were.Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, a man whose life is televised 24 hours a day.  It's very interesting to see Carrey in a dramatic role. He's actually pretty good at it.Everyone should see this movie at least once, to see that there is some originality left in movies today.",The Truman Show
554,evefarion,"""Good Afternoon, Good Evening and Goodnight!""",9,4 May 2020,"The Truman Show was an immaculate and visually stunning film that was ultimately one of Jim Carrey's best roles. Jim Carrey offers an iconic performance as the naive salesmen, and while being one of his less over-the-top roles, he is able to put a bit of himself into Truman which really takes the character to the next level.
This film had an original, well developed concept that was able to convey strong messages and is still light-hearted and comedic. It maintains a good story and morals while also being technically excellent with magnificent cinematography. The shot of Truman walking up the stairs in the sky is one of the most beautiful shots I've ever seen. The story was able to portray many ideas throughout the film that questioned reality itself.
Cristof states ""We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented."", which is very accurate in my opinion. We are put on this earth with no true sense of reality until we are presented with it. Our beliefs manifest from what others tell us to believe. Truman represents society being forced to follow under the beliefs of high power without having any of their own. But upon realization, Truman can break free and move on to a better life.
Christof is an excellent antagonist. He is said to represent God and how he has control of everyone and everything. I didn't see him as a villain until he overturned Truman's boat, unspokenly admitting that he'd rather have Burbank die than lose his star and TV show. He believed the whole film that he was in the right, never once doubting his ideas or thoughts. To him, his assistants and staff, he was not the villain but the hero; bringing a wonderful show to viewers around the world, to the detriment of Truman's life and freedom.
With our current crisis, the world seems to be silent. Our reality feels altered and shifted in a way that seems eternal, similar to Burbank's. But like Truman, we can rise above it all and come out the other side feeling more confident and stronger than ever. Eventually, this will be a blip in our lives and in history, becoming something we can laugh about as I imagine Truman would too. Peter Weir created amazing films like The Dead Poets Society and Witness, with the Truman Show being another. This film was a beautiful representation of society and its morals and is still a great film 23 years later.",The Truman Show

556,crisp_morning_2004,"Wait a second, where will he go? Into another deceitful world, leaving former lies behind?",9,20 August 2006,"Christof, the omnipotent, authoritative, media-savvy producer-director in The Truman Show, is identified with Christian. Everything, from sunrise-sunset to each passer-by in the Utopian town named Seahaven, is in his charge, without mentioning Truman, the leading role in this show. Since the day he was born, Truman has been taken good care of by a crop of actors and actresses and functioned as the protagonist of an international televised, 24-hour-a-day series called The Truman Show. 5,000 hidden cameras follow Truman everywhere he goes, chronicling every trivia of his growth. Unknown to him is the trick known to all.Until someday, from nowhere falls a light equipment. Later, he is soaked in his own rainstorm. When he moves, the rain moves after him. Then, through an oversight, his lost-at-sea father is rearranged into the show again, appearing like a transient in the street. Truman is puzzled by all these inconsistencies. What's worse, on his way to work one day, the radio gets adrift to report his trace in every detail due to a slip of technique. It's paradoxical to call these inconsistencies deliberate coincidences. Because that's what Christof hates but Peter Weif and Andrew Niccol expects.We have no doubt carelessness beyond control is here and there in Truman's life. It's only a matter of time before Truman to piece out the loopholes together and find out the truth. He is determined to leave the counterfeit world when he is exposed, mercilessly, to the fact that this so-called perfect life he leads is no more than a show-biz illusion where only he is true while others exit merely as walk-ons. Since all other transport doesn't serve him, he chooses sea. (In order to keep him from leaving Seahaven, he has been inculcated with a fear of water. He has expectedly developed a phobia of water since the night his father lost at sea, a catastrophe designed to frighten him.) Having survived all weird rainstorms under Christof's control, he sails cheerfully to his dream world, only to find the sky, the clouds looking so beautiful in distance are pictures in a wall and the horizon itself leads nowhere.Jim Carrey plays Truman. He is so likable an actor that you cannot refuse any film he takes part in. Most of his films are characteristic of his hilarious performances. But his role in this one is, I should say, light year away from the antics he used to do. He is quite controlled and convincing.As a sharp-witted, intriguing and offbeat piece of entertainment, the film can be dissected from different angles. And it inevitably raises some questions. To me, the end is hallucination. I admit the end is hopeful to most audience. It seems to reach to consummate when Truman opens the door in the wall and strides out. We are about to applause. Wait a second, where will he go? Into a world full of new lies, leaving former lies behind? So I'd rather have a hateful end.",The Truman Show

But few years ago, my crush in high school set the Truman show poster( the one with Truman's laughing face on it) as his line profile, and I immediately rewatched it that night in order to discuss with him on the other day(yeh such a indecisive valley) but wow it turned out to be resonated af. I supposed that people who are a bit cynical and negative or who sometimes figures that life is a bi*th would feel related to Truman. We're all shackled by frames of social norms and standards, struggling with what I'm supposed to be, dominated by what I supposed to do. People unfriendly eyes and attention disturb us to be ourselves. Their unintentional comments hit the softest part of our hearts. All these make us live as performing an ever-lasting show, we'll never be satisfied with the suppressing and deceiving scenarios, and either are the audience, the public, the society.

560,crittercat,Saying it's so doesn't make it so,3,15 March 2005,"God, I wanted to like this film. Jim Carrey is a good actor, an excellent physical comic, he's also capable of giving heartfelt truthful performances. He does it here.Confound it, I want to like everything Peter Weir does. I frequently don't, but I'm always willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Anyone who can do a ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" can't be all bad. He obviously has the capacity to make us see, feel, understand without overstating the obvious; all while skirting the obvious, for heaven's sake! ""The Truman Show,"" therefore, SHOULD have been one of my year's high points cinematic ally. Maybe I was in a bad mood when I saw the advanced screening. I returned and actually paid to see it. Maybe the first-view dyspepsia carried over, maybe I hadn't given it enough time.I rented it.Okay: I liked it less the second time I saw it. I almost hated it on the third viewing. (I know, I KNOW...A film -- play, painting, a joke... whatever -- is meant to be grabbed on first view, by single exposure. Repeated looks are bound to let us explore flaws...but, dammit, I was trying to give the thing a break. Really. It IS the kind of thing I should love...) What's wrong with Truman? It's one of those things that SAYS it's going to do something. It tells us what it intends to show, then proceeds NOT to show us, but to restate the thesis! And the audience is expected to buy into the notion that the film has actually explored the issues... whatever they are.Truman, for me, is all statement and no delivery. It gives us a wonderfully correct theme...a charming, easy to root-for hero...a potentially exciting and interestingly equivocal villain...then blows it all away because it hasn't got the courage of it's own set-up.What WOULD make Truman, despite a lifetime of conditioning, get on that boat?

Too facile...like Jim Carrey's talking butt...an easy laugh, a go-for-the-guaranteed-result.

561,Mark1988,One of the Most Original Films Ever Made,10,9 April 2007,"'The Truman Show' epitomizes strong and original storytelling on screen. This film is emotionally engaging, didactic, witty, dramatic and very unique. For those unfamiliar with the concept, Truman Burbank has never left his ideal home town of Sea Haven. What he doesn't know is that his entire environment is a materialized set and he is the ignorant star of a reality TV show of epic proportions.Taking this entirely original concept, writer Andrew Niccol and director Peter Wier take the viewer into territory uncharted by anything in film history. Thus, the plot is entirely unpredictable but still flows along expertly. The tightness of the screenplay and the immaculate pacing of Peter Wier contribute largely to this film's brilliance.The acting performances are amongst the best I've ever seen. Jim Carey is superb as Truman, effortlessly conveying his fears, desires and personality. Ed Harris is excellent as the reclusive creator of the production. In addition, the entire support cast appears synthetic enough to let the audience know they are ""acting"" for Truman but in some scenes let their ""genuine"" feelings shine through. The ensemble simply cannot be faulted. Carey was hardly done by not to get an Oscar nomination for his performance.The music and visuals are top notch. The cinematography has a reality TV feel that is clever but never intrusive. The shot selection is of the highest quality, particularly in the movie's final sequence. Muscially, this film is incredible. Phillip Glass is a dream on the piano, perfectly evoking the mood for each section of the narrative. The two combine excellently during the scene in which Truman breaks his routine for the first time. During the sequence, Truman makes subtle changes to the bland routine he follows compliantly every day. The emotion of the music when combined with the apparent simplicity of Truman's actions makes this scene one the most powerful I'v ever experienced.This film is an absolute gem. It effortlessly combines everything a classic film should have. It has comedy, drama, strong character development, atmosphere, originality, superb visuals, a superb score, tight writing, raises interesting moral questions as well as providing insight into the human condition. One cannot watch this spectacular film without wondering how a human would react when put in that kind of situation. It touches on our sense of adventure, desire for conformity and the courage we require to question the life we are presented with. 'The Truman Show' does all this in the most accessible and compelling fashion. One of the greatest films of our time.",The Truman Show
562,thelockbox,Weir's masterpiece,10,12 February 2002,"Peter Weir is a wonderfully talented director, who differs from most with his wonderful use of symbolism, but with the Truman Show he steps up and delivers.

It's a gem.",The Truman Show
563,Equivoco,"A great satire, more relevant with each passing year.",9,18 September 2007,"This was a movie that intrigued me from my first viewing of the trailer. It seemed so fresh, so new. (Too often trailers seem to advertise a movie you have seen many times before.) The concept is audacious (if not entirely plausible) but the real strength is in the dialogue and the performances. Jim Carey grates very occasionally but the rest of the cast is spot on. The ways in which Truman's ""friends"" and ""family"" profess their affection while simultaneously betraying him are funny, sad and lacerating all at the same time. Repeated viewings have not dulled the edge of this modern morality tale.Reality TV was not such a ubiquitous presence when this movie was made (and I hope ardently for it's eventual demise) so that this movie has become more relevant and less unlikely with every passing year.",The Truman Show
564,steve_mclaughlin2,I hereby proclaim this planet Trumania of the Burbank Galaxy.,10,28 January 2009,"One of my top-5 movies of all time. Jim Carrey delivers a flawless performance as Truman Burbank, a made-for-television character unknowingly viewed by millions 24/7 around the world. Truman's 'world,' the lovely 1950s'ish town of Seahaven is the creation of Cristof played wonderfully by Ed Harris. All the townsfolk including his wife Meryl (Laura Linney), best friend Marlon (Noah Emmerich), and even his mother (Holland Taylor) are in on charade. All goes well till Truman starts discovering how the town is staged. Wanting to see the world (including one true love Lauren (Natascha McElhone)), Truman desperately attempts to leave the Island and discover what's beyond Seahaven.I didn't see this movie when it was in theaters. Jim Carrey in a serious film, no thanks. Did rent it years later and couldn't believe how great this movie is. The story, cast, music, etc.. Everything perfect. This movie MUST be viewed more than once. Took me 3-4 times to truly appreciate the depth the film has to offer. It's an absolute shame this film didn't receive more Oscar nominations.Carry's performance is genius! Even subtle things, like when he repeatedly taps the light that fell from the sky, exactly what a child would do to first test a foreign object. I liked Carrey a lot in his previous comedy movies, with this performance though he REALLY shows range. Ed Harris is perfect as (Christ)of, the creator. The film really slams it's own industry. But how do you intend to explain his 22-year absence? Amnesia. Brilliant!! This is one of those movies you get really get lost in, not concerning oneself with believability issues. I also loved the way it ended with so many issues left to the viewers imagination instead of normal feel-goody Hollywood ending. It really is thought provoking.Also, the music is absolutely perfect throughout!!",The Truman Show
565,macca7174,Genius,10,18 February 2003,"The worst thing about this film is that is was probably the direct inspiration for all the big brother/ reality TV crap that saturates the TV listings these days.

566,theshadowoftheghost,Brilliant.,10,27 January 2012,"If you can't give something 10/10 to, what can you? This is an excellent film in so many ways. It's heart-warming, inspiring and tear-jerking at times. I was going to give it a 9, but this is exactly what movies should be about: originality, ambition, great directing & acting, and an immersion into a world built up within it. Truman Show has all those qualities. This is something that has never been done before. Those of you who want to take something philosophical away from this film and look into it deeply will find you can do just that; it's deep enough to incite thought, and those of you who just want to sit through a feel-good movie with a few twists and turns that will leave you gripped need look no further. I think this was the first time we saw Carrey shy away from comedy, and although there are parts of his humour that shine through, the film is all the better for it. He plays this part perfectly, right through to its epic climax. His humour is not utilised in this film to give his center stage and an open floor to be as silly as he can, instead this film allows you to laugh with him, and not feel as if you're watching a stand-up show. The rest of the cast are perfect, fitting in well, including Ed Harris as the ""director"". He surprised me here, because he is just the ""right"" amount of his usual badass self, mixed with some emotion and empathy. This is definitely an original concept, and executed well. I haven't seen this film in a few years yet still remember much of it. You won't be disappointed.",The Truman Show
567,neferu,"a seriously frightening idea, Carey is perfect",7,26 August 2005,"This idea spooked me out a bit. The whole world watching one guy on a television programme. A ridiculously humongous set so that he'd never know. Jim Carey was perfect; a seriously funny person but he has another brilliant personality up his sleeve. He can look seriously insane. Jim brings a refreshingly interesting and masterful edge to this film. He plays an ordinary insurance seller in a world that seems to revolve strangely around him. Slowly he begins to realise that things are not as they seem. A strange object plummets down from the sky that appears to be a stage light. It starts to rain... only on the spot where he is standing. His car radio suddenly has strange interferences and then starts reading out his exact coordinates. Jim Carey plays the role very well and one of my favourite scenes is where he and his supposed wife are alone in the house and Jim snaps. The wife's - (actor's!) - desperate attempts to suppress his confused anger and realisation is very cleverly done, but the whole idea, though being original, does seem a bit too far-fetched. Jim Carey as always adds his hilariously wacky touch to the film and overall this is a masterful and original film that impressed and intrigued me massively! Good morning! and in case i don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening and goodnight! very funny- 7/10 ;-)",The Truman Show
568,millmat,Not your average Jim Carrey.,10,6 November 2013,"""The Truman Show"" isn't your average Jim Carrey film, as it doesn't show Carrey using his usual schtick as he does in other movies. And those are the Jim Carrey films that I love to see, because when you take away his comedic appeal, you can get a very dramatic and emotional actor. Carrey plays a man who is unaware that his entire life is a television show. He has been on the show ever since he was an infant. Despite having kept this a secret for 30 years, Truman soon begins to suspect something different about his perfect life, despite the shows clever and hilarious lengths to keep him uninterested in the world outside of him. Where does Truman want to go? Well, in a very interesting subplot, we learn that Truman wants to visit Fiji. Why? Because the girl of his dreams, (previously an extra on the show, now an activist living in the real world with an ambition to free Truman with the help of political activism) was taken away by her supposed father, who hastily replied that they were going to Fiji. Now Truman wants to go to Fiji to reunite with the love of his life, and escape his blond and boring wife. If there's one thing that holds this film together, it's the acting. Not just from Carrey, but from the supporting cast, which has an exceptionally difficult job of being a good actor when portraying a good actor, and they pull it off flawlessly. One of ""The Truman Show's"" themes is feeding into ones anxieties. It carries this off by having Truman live in a world where travel is frowned upon and made to seem to dangerous and too expensive. There's a really funny and well done scene where Truman goes mad, and attempts to drive to anywhere in America, and the show tried to retail irate by presenting Truman with controlled dilemmas like traffic, forest fires and chemical leaks. It makes me happy that I didn't see it when I was younger, because it surely would upset me. But even still, Truman still attempts to escape, giving the character a sense of courage. And that's what makes ""The Truman Show"" work. The character is great. The character is relatable. He represents a great film character. And what great film character would be complete without a great film. ""The Truman Show."" Check it out.",The Truman Show
569,muckydog2,The Nixon Show,1,29 March 2015,"The tragedy that people consider this film reaches some philosophical nirvana accompanied with a deep meaningful message adds to the contempt I already have for this excrement. A child's mind could only deliver an idea like this, maybe plagiarising a Twilight Zone episode. The technically superior camera work and uncluttered cartoon like sets only allow the viewer sharp focus on the banality of this story. I will not go into detail as others have, I just add my 1/10 to the mix.Some of us are not fans of Jim Carey either, and his addition to any movie relegates it to doom anyhow. I knew it would be a bad idea to watch this, but I went along, accompanied by a nagging suspicion, with the high score and praise.More proof that either the majority are stupid or I am a loony.

571,Larry-17,Saying it's so doesn't make it so...,6,21 February 1999,"God.  I wanted to like this film.  I think Jim Carrey is a good actor.  An excellent physical comic, he's also capable of giving a heartfelt truthful performance.  He does it here.Confound it, I want to like everything Peter Weir does.  I frequently don't, but I'm always willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.  Anyone who can do a ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" can't be all bad.  He obviously has the capacity to make us see, feel, understand without overstating the obvious; while skirting the obvious, for heaven's sake!""The Truman Show,"" therefore, SHOULD have been one of my year's high points cinematically.

Maybe the first-view dyspepsia carried over, maybe I hadn't given it enough time.I rented it.Okay: I liked it less the second time I saw it.  I almost hated it on the third viewing.  (I know, I KNOW...A film -- play, painting, joke...whatever -- is meant to be grabbed on a first view, a single exposure.  Repeated looks are bound to let us explore the flaws...but, dammit, I was trying to give the thing a break.  Really.  It IS the kind of thing I should love...)What's wrong with Truman?  It's one of those things that SAYS it's going to do something.  It tells us what it intends to show, then proceeds to NOT show us, but to restate the thesis!  And the audience is expected to buy into the notion that the film has actually explored the issues... whatever they are.Truman, for me, is all statement and no delivery.  It gives us a wonderfully correct theme...a charming, easy to root-for hero...a potentially exciting and interestingly equivocal villain...then blows it all away because it hasn't got the courage of it's own set-up.What WOULD make Truman, despite a lifetime of conditioning, get on that boat?

He so easily accepts the unacceptable, he so easily overcomes every problem the film gives him, that there is no dramatic tension, no questions, no...no film!Of course, it presents us with a user-friendly, feel-good ending.

572,fod-2,The fear of Solitude,10,25 November 1998,"The consciousness of the individualist is only able to imagine the individual consciousness. Somewhere between the illusion of power and the realization of no power exists the existential nightmare which we observe in Truman. He is indeed 'true-man' and can be identified with perhaps more than any hero in the history of the screen simply because he IS the screen and we are given awareness of the fact. Truman will be destroyed by the outside world - maybe a bit pessimistic - because he will become the greatest celebrity in the history of the role. Whereas, to him, our Earth is his Heaven, our heaven is his unimaginable and the frightening realities (violence, pollution) are his Hell.

If you want a good comment... See the film and let your brain do the work.The director, Peter Wait, did a great job. The manuscript is well- written by Andrew Niccol. The concept of the movie is that Truman Burbank is the character in the worlds most seen TV- show. The show is called ""The Truman Show"". Truman doesn't know that he is the main- character in the show. The creators of the show has created a mini- world for Truman to live in.Everybody Truman meets is actors. His mother, his wife and his best friend. The studio is full of cameras and they plan his whole life. They fix every error that occurs. One day, the biggest error possible occurs. Will they be able to fix it?In my opinion Jim Carrey (Truman Burbank) did a great performance. Perhaps his best ever. He is well known by his comedies...Ace ventura 1 and 2, the cable guy, the mask and dumb and dumber. He is an excellent comedy- actor. But as mentioned he fits very well into the drama. The other actors did a great performance too.If you expect a pure comedy when you sit down to see ""the Truman show"" I believe you will be very disappointed. This is a fantasy\drama.

As a man who's begun to realize that his entire world is not what it seems, Truman's reactions to these breakdowns in his reality are priceless.  The car trip in which he tries to escape the `city' is absolutely hilarious.  Carrey's typical brand of slapstick and low-class humor is thankfully absent from this movie.  In its place is a movie that you feel good laughing at.  And Truman's scene with his `father' is a true work of art.  Don't miss this movie.",The Truman Show

In the beginning of the movie, it really makes you think about life itself and it brought so many philosophical questions to my mind. Witnessing how the people he considered friends, and even his own wife didn't actually care about him was heartbreaking, as they were all just actors.
That being said I believe so much more could've been done because they had such a brilliant idea behind it. The ending really leaves you wondering and I just can't help but wish for more. Although I thoroughly enjoyed it, it feels unfinished in my mind. Either way, even just for the idea itself and how well it is presented, it's totally worth the watch.",The Truman Show
579,Aboxofbread,Gives you a lot to think about,8,27 April 2020,"The Truman Show was a great film. The time I spend watching it I was engaged, and I thought it did a great job of mixing in comedy without getting rid of the more serious aspects of the film. It made me think a lot about what I would have ended up doing in the situations Truman was put it; for instance, would I have had the guts to leave Seahaven after so long?
Christof found a way to become god-like, and to many around the world who watched the Truman Show, he was probably considered a hero of sorts. But to Truman and Sylvia, he was a great villain. Trapping Truman in this picture perfect, happy-go-lucky town gave Christof complete control of every piece of his life. For Truman, once he realized things weren't as they seemed, he started to see that nothing in life was his choice, nothing belonged just to him except Sylvia, and his escape at the end to find her and
start his own life is sort of like the risks we take in life, to pursuit something that feels far away or out of the question.
I think that when Christof said, ""we accept the reality of the world with which we're presented,"" he was partly right. I mean, we grow up understanding the things around us, the routines and the constants. Why would we have any reason to question what we've known our whole lives? If we could change our realities, we wouldn't learn half as much as we do. If every time we failed a test in school or didn't get the job we just decided, 'hey, no, I'm just going to change that,' we'd lose so much valuable life experience. Our lives would be more fake than real.In all, I thought The Truman Show was really, quite excellent.",The Truman Show

587,cathaleoin1999,This is a film you must see. End of!,10,8 October 2016,"I don't know why I really should bother writing the 915th review of this film on IMDb, but such is the power of The Truman Show that I saw myself left with no choice but to. To put it in simplistic terms, this film is nigh-on perfect. There is no fault with this film, and if anyone finds a fault with it, I would love to be informed of said fault to see if it is really a fault. Jim Carrey gives the best performance of the year (with maybe the exception of Roberto Benigni in Life is Beautiful) as Truman Burbank, perfectly portraying the paranoia and strife a man in such dire circumstances must go through. Ed Harris is enigmatic and scene-stealing as Christof, and honestly I think it is one of the best-written parts in the last twenty years of cinema. The rest of the cast are excellent too, ranging from Laura Linney as an actress who knows that The Truman Show is her big break, to Paul Giamatti in a very small role in the ""real"" world. Andrew Niccol's script is one of the best ever in Hollywood, on par with Paddy Chayefsky's Network and Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. Peter Weir's direction is brilliant, but I now find myself contradicting what I earlier said about there being no faults with this film. The only fault with this film is that they didn't go far enough. I read in the trivia section on IMDb that Peter Weir planned to have the film cut, the screen shows people watching the film in the theater through a security webcam, and then keep going on with the film. This would have been amazing, and we are left with only wishful thinking of what might've been. Several other deleted scenes, one being a jogger portrayed by an actor who two days previous had played a homeless man in a wheelchair, would have elevated this film from nigh-on perfect to as important as Network or dare I say Citizen Kane. In one of the strongest years in film, this film was almost thrown into the gutter and forgotten about at the Academy Awards. I need not tell you how much of a disgrace it is Carrey didn't win for Best Actor and Niccol win for Best Original Screenplay. Thank God everyone else on IMDb agrees with me that this film is outstanding, except with its current ranking of 207, I am also disappointed because really it should be top 25-30. This film contains many subtle messages, from schizophrenia to the power the media holds in our society, and it is very difficult to choose what moment is best, except I think I have it. At the very end, and in case anyone didn't see the banner at the top SPOILER ALERT, when Truman exits his alternate reality, and the show ends, we see two men discuss what to watch next, so seamlessly as if they have to watch something. This is the best moment of the film because it shows our complete lack of care for Truman, and that once something ends that we have devoted time to watching it, we must go and begin to watch something else. This film is difficult to comprehend with one viewing, but once you appreciate its power, its subtleties and its satirical messages, then you will relate to this review.",The Truman Show

And you don't need to notice them. But if you notice it remains as interesting information in your mind. Well, long story short just watch it, you're not gonna be regret it.",The Truman Show

This was a monumental mistake as this is a subtle classic, and starts well and ends well. Right now, at least, this is probably my favorite movie. I am only rating this 8 because I do not like giving something my highest rating, and have not done so.( at the time of this review). I really loved this film, and everything about it is amazing. If you have not watched it, watch it. It is great. There are a few continuity errors, however, but they are not noticeable, and do not detract from the rest of the film. watch this film.",The Truman Show

594,pluis,Great film despite lots of weaknesses,8,1 November 1998,"At last The Truman Show has reached the mainland of Europe. And after all the hype I saw on IMBb reviews, I must confess that I am a little bit disappointed. True, the movie makes its depressing theme ""life imitates the media"" very clear, and I would advise every critic who mistakenly calls this a comedy, to look up that word in a dictionary and compare the result with the things he has witnessed on the screen. The view on society that is pictured in The Truman Show is very bleak indeed. Still, good drama should be believable all the way and it is here that director and scriptwiter let us down. The suggestion is that people are watching the show day in day out and never consider switching channels. Why? Of course the idea of an actor believing he is leading a normal life is appealing (to the audience), but is it entertaining as well? What happens when Truman goes to sleep, and his house is dark and silent during seven or eight hours? In fact, what happened in the first couple of years of his life, when he wasn't up to anything more substantial than crying while lying down or whatever an infant does to pass the time? It is hardly likely that viewers enjoyed the continuous sight of an infant solely for the reason that it wasn't aware of this ""immoral"" intrusion of its privacy.Another weak point in the story is the fact that the artificial nature of Seahaven becomes rapidly visible during the film while up to then the phoney aspects of life in Truman's hometown were successfully hidden. How come never before a lamp fell down from the ceiling? How come never before the local radio channel was inadvertently intruded by conversations of the film crew? How come it took Truman thirty years to discover that the elevator in the building next to his office really wasn't an elevator at all? In short, what are the odds that it takes a not too dumb guy like Truman thirty years to discover within a few days the extent of the manipulation by the film makers? The really amazing thing of the movie is that, despite all these silly loose ends in the script, the viewer is as indignant as he should be about a man being manipulated for such a long time, for no other reason than making a megalomaniac getting his kicks.",The Truman Show
595,Anth-M,A good film instead of an American classic.,9,14 November 2007,"This film is admirably original in its premise but its execution leaves something to be desired. With Andrew Niccol's deftly original screenplay, ""The Truman Show"" had the potential to be an American classic along the lines of Paddy Chayefsky's ""Network."" Instead, director Peter Weir elected to make a high concept Hollywood comedy with bankable funnyman Jim Carrey as his star. The story unravels in a somewhat choppy manner coveting easy laughs instead of fully realizing the satirical power at its core. In fact, the comedy, specifically, the cutaways to ""show viewers"" and the interview segment with the ""creator"", is rather banal and uninspired. As for Jim Carrey, to his credit, he does a fine job balancing comedy and drama, particularly in the film's climactic rite of passage.",The Truman Show
596,tajci,The best movie of the year,10,9 December 1998,"This is the only movie from the entire summer season that I've been looking forward to, and I was quite scared that I'd be disappointed when I finally walked into the cinema. But - without a reason. The Truman Show IS the best movie I've seen this year. I think, I admire most how ""whole"" it seems. From the beginning to the end we have been watching THE Truman Show, and not the movie about Truman Show (although there are bits of that as well - and I feel that this is it's only flaw). I enjoyed every line and every scene in it. The movie is full of excellent writing and directing. The way that Peter Weir doesn't want to show Truman's deepest emotions when he finally finds exit, but instead hides his face from us and let us imagine how Truman feels. Or how motive of escape to Fiji evolves in the movie: first, it's just a remote place on the Earth where Truman wants to escape; then it's a place where his love lives; and finally, it's a map of Fiji that hides Truman's escape. And so, in a way, Fiji becomes Truman's escape. Also, the amount of our identification with Truman is amassing and unseen in Hollywood movies for years. And if you haven't seen the movie and you're afraid that it's very ""serious"", i.e. boring, I can reassure you: It's not boring - it's funny and time just flys by. I would say that this movie is a MUST for everyone, especially those who think that Jim Carry cannot act (I was one of those, but I've changed my mind). P.S. I've seen once an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" with the same main plot, but it ended differently.",The Truman Show
597,Gueyome,surprising!,10,16 November 1998,"I am very glad having seen this movie at the theater.  I'm lucky because I was able to see it before someone tells me the story.  I knew it was inspired by Louis 19, a movie ""made in Quebec"", and I was expecting to something slightly the same (with a budget ten times greater).  I was wrong. At the beginning, I was amazed and I understood Truman's situation only after half an hour.  What is funny in this movie is the way it ridiculizes TV programs and soap operas.  The sequence when Truman meets his father is one of the funniest I have seen in my life",The Truman Show
598,Mr. Fish-3,On the air - but who cares?,3,13 November 1998,"A wonderful concept, highly original, but unfortunately, poorly implemented. The sets are good and Jim Carrey's as good as he ever was, though.  You just feel when you leave the cinema that something was missing.  No real beginning and no real end.",The Truman Show
599,movifan,"Original, entertaining story and surprisingly good acting.",10,26 July 1999,"Jim Carrey would not be on too many lists for very good actors, but he is a major talent.  His comedy is alternately inventive and off-putting.  Yet here he is in a role that is original and interesting.He plays Truman Burbank, who lives in a nice, quiet town where everyone knows everyone.  But little does he know he is the subject of a 24-hour TV show.The screenplay is creative in inventing ways to keep Truman from knowing this fact, such as a fear of the ocean, and in the  gradual awakening to a new reality that Truman must face.Carrey makes Truman into a sympathetic character, who is thrust into a situation that is hard to accept.  Everything he's ever known is staged. It is a touching, likable performance that is complete and true to character.Ed Harris provides fine support as Cristof, the creator of ""The Truman Show,"" opting for a low-key approach rather than a madman performance that makes him worthy of pity.Andrew Niccol (""Gattaca"")'s screenplay is one of the most creative in a long time, which presents intriguing questions about the nature of television, privacy and how far technology should be taken.  Is it okay to place a person in a bubble all his life for all to see? Just because we can, must we? Those questions provide for a multi-layered plot that makes you think.Strong direction from Peter Weir (""Witness,"" ""Dead Poets Society"").",The Truman Show
600,JUuttu,It _had_ potential.,3,22 September 1999,"When the movie started I hoped I'd see a movie that utilized the potentiality of what this kind of plot has: Finding that your whole life was one big lie - and the emotional crisis that follows it. Alas, that was not to follow - I hoped the movie would go on from the point Truman successfully escaped the place, but instead the movie ended.I was dismayed that the director didn't realise what great potentiality the movie would had if we could see the emotions Truman would go thru when he finds the Real World(Tm). One would go insane from going from a safe haven to a more unfriendlier and tough world, which would be very interesting to see - and give the movie a much more emotional edge! Which is a shame, because at its current form it does not live up to the hype it had back then.",The Truman Show

602,Heavy_Reviews,This is outstanding !,10,22 April 2020,"My friend messaged me one day and said:
""Listen, Leave everything. Just watch THE TRUMAN SHOW. You will love this. Just Watch it""
And I was like OKAY! Let's do this.I would say that this is one of the most original, inspiring, & productive movies ever made. This film is emotionally appealing, humorous, exciting and very unique. For those who are unfamiliar with the plot, this story revolves around a person, Truman Burbank, who has never left his ideal home town of Sea Haven. He doesn't know that his whole life was a TV Show. His friends, his wife, in fact his entire environment is a set.Can you even imagine your life being captivated without knowing? Your neighbours, your family, your wife and even your best friend, and those you ever knew were just actors, pretending to be people they are not.This movie motivated me well enough. The first thing came into my mind while watching this was:
""Hold on to your boat. Everything is gonna change, your thirst for mysteries will be quenched. ONE DAY, you'll find all the answers.""
The friend who suggested this said: ""You can compare your life according to set patterns and whoever tries to deviate from those is labelled crazy!""Have you watched this? If no, what are you still waiting for?

603,cstngcrns,The Truman Show,10,8 August 2006,The Truman Show has brought me to a new level of suspense and wonder. It captured me with the great plot and script. Jim Carry is at his best in this film. All of the emotions were unbearable and are sure to take your breath away and add a tear to your eye. Other movies try to conciel the emotions that are possessed by the main characters. This movie will have you guessing all the way through only to find you were wrong and the extreme twist us unraveled. This film is like opening a new door to wonder and suspense and you will want to open the door and never come out.

607,uofjoe,Best film of 1998,10,24 June 2002,The Truman show is an almost perfect example of filmmaking at its best.  The performances (especially of funnyman Jim Carrey) are astounding and the plot is amazing.  The Truman Show is the story of a man who lives in a perfect world.  He soon realizes that this world is actually a painstakingly crafted set for a TV show inwhich he is the star.  The film draws you in so much that the line begins to blur: are you the viewer of a simple film or one of the vouyers watching Truman's life?  That is where the director really gets you.  Watching this movie in a post-Survivor world makes a reality-show lover writhe in their chair as it paints a picture of the people who watch this show.,The Truman Show
608,liamzdaman2,The Trueman show review,10,6 October 2008,"In 1997 Jim Carrey had just released Liar Liar a film that showed his comic ability at its full strength but there was something in him that wanted to change, wanted to move on and be brave. So ow we have The Trueman Show.This excellent film shows a man living his life in a television show of his life. This is all without him knowing and as he struggles with problems in his life he begins to realise that everything is revolving around him in some way.This is a very good idea for a film and does nothing but interest the viewer. Rich of laughs and sighs.The first thing about this film that many people will notice is hoe different Jim Carrey is compared to his previous film. H is outstanding in this film and fully deserved his golden globe. The acting in general is very good, Ed Harris gave an Oscar nominated performance here, which was also fully deserved.As in many films there are several loop holes but they ban be forgiven as the sheer brilliance of the movie shines through 10 out of 10",The Truman Show

611,ryaneco,Great Film,8,5 February 2004,The truman show would have to be one of the best films of 1998. The film has its comedic parts yet also is very dramatic. It marks the suprise turn of Slap-stick comedy actor Jim Carey into the drama/serious movies and does it not that badly. The themes resonate throughout the film and in the space of 100mins you grow to love the characters and the ending leaves you feeling sad yet somewhat happy for truman as he embarks on his final leg of the groundbreaking show. 8/10,The Truman Show
612,margaretafb,Fake smiles or real tears,9,17 September 2013,"Far from being a masterpiece, this film has something special to offer to the viewers. It's really enjoyable, fun and smart. Besides subtly criticizing the media and it's ways of manipulation this film was a true lesson to me. It made me think about the importance of living, knowing and discovering. Some of us fear change and can't easily get out of their comfort zone. I think it's a big deal to have the courage to leave your home, that place that made you who you are to face the world and get to know yourself better. The human mind is a very complex ""toy"" but also fragile. Sometimes we prefer living a lie because it gives us sort of a sense of security, sometimes we reject new experiences just because they are...new, sometimes we like to live in our own little universe for fear of the others. This film has many morals and it's up to each of us to discover one. For me, the moral was: It's never too late to escape from the perfect little world you've created or the others have created for you and start to LIVE for REAL!",The Truman Show
613,melliott-7,"A GREAT Film, totally ignored by the critics and Oscars!!!",10,24 October 2009,"OK. I watched this film when it first came out in 1998. At the time, I thought it was a very good film with undoubtedly the best performance by an actor that I'd ever seen, at the time, by none other than Mr. Jim Carrey. I was never a big fan of this guy until 'The Truman Show'. His performance alone is worth the price of a rental! Only the recent performance by Sharlto Copley in 'District 9' is somewhat better than Mr. Carrey's. Over the years since it was released, 'The Truman Show' has become more relevant, and far more potent and personal. I watched it again a couple of nights ago, and was shocked, realizing while watching the film, at how our current television programs have been overrun with 'reality' shows and 'entertainment reality' shows. With what may be divine foresight, Mr. Peter Weir and his crew created 'The Truman Show' which depicts our 'reality show' at its far extreme. If you haven't seen this, and are a 'reality show' fan, then watch this movie, and prepare to be shaken. A tie for my number 2 spot with 'The Green Mile', behind the number one film of all time 'The Shawshank Redemption'. And like 'Shawshank', I strongly believe that this film's list of admirers will continue to grow such that it will be, someday, in the 'IMDB's Top 250' where it so rightfully belongs! Heck, it should be in the 'Top 10'!",The Truman Show

617,evangelia_tripoliti,magnificent,10,28 July 2019,"Everytime I watch this movie I can't help but thinking George Orwell's book 1984. The big brother is always watching, and you can't escape. Is your life really your own? Do you make your own decisions? Are you really free, and if not, can you run away? You may try, but it's almost certain that it'll kill you, and if not, they'll call you crazy. The similarities with the book - in a way - are almost scary.

619,jonmeta,You choose: the fake light or the black door,7,9 December 2006,"Peter Weir's earliest major films -The Last Wave, Picnic at Hanging Rock --are studies of people overwhelmed by circumstances they can't understand or control. But his later films offer hope of redemption and triumph. Like Dead Poets' Society, the Truman Show is the story of struggle for freedom from an oppressive system. While ""DPS"" was an interesting development of a standard situation (a liberal-minded teacher helps students free their minds from tradition through creative literature) the Truman Show is based on a very unique setup. The main character, Truman Burbank, is the only ""true man"" in a TV-show world of actors and commercial advertising. We, the viewers, discover this truth before he does because Weir introduces us to a selection of viewers who are hooked on the show. The film holds our interest by showing us, first, Truman's process of discovery, and then his attempts to escape his situation.A lot has been made out of the supposed religious elements of the Truman Show, presumably because of the ""Christof-Christ"" name parallel (a bit too cute, don't you think?). But to turn the film into a religious allegory misses the obvious: the film is about the line between fake and real, and how television destroys humanity by hooking us on images in order to sell products. The key line in the film is (Truman to Christof): ""You never had a camera in my head!"" You can't say that about God. Second, the real Christ was a rebel (as in the confrontation with the money-changers) who was killed by the system. If you want a Christ image in the Truman Show, it's Truman ""walking on water"" at the end of the film, not the lord of commercialism chillingly played by Ed Harris.If there's a deeper philosophical message in the film, it has to be the rejection of the postmodern idea of how we know what we know. Truman lives in a world that's been created for him. A postmodernist (i.e., pretty much anyone teaching in the literature or history department of my university) would say that we accept the world we're given. What we ""know to be true"" is what we are told is true. My ""truth"" depends entirely on the culture I live in and the categories of thought I'm provided with. On this basis, Truman should never escape Seahaven. But human intellect and curiosity exist precisely to question and change categories of thought. So, Truman's quest for the truth involves observing both anomalies (a falling stage light, odd patches of rain) where there should be consistency, and patterns (bicycle, flowers, Beetle!) where there should be randomness. He persists until he finds a way out of the world of image into the real world, out of the fake light, sky and clouds into the black door of whatever is out there. The tragedy is that the commercial world of television needs us not to find our way out. So the very last image of the Truman Show is not the hero escaping, but the viewers saying, ""So, what else is on?""",The Truman Show
620,Pete-17,"Strong premise, weak execution",7,13 September 1998,"What occurs in the first act of ""The Truman Show"" is about as good as it gets.  The expectations for this movie (and probably most of its overrated praise) are based on the first half of the movie in which the Ed Harris character describes ""no scripts"", ""no cuecards"", and most importantly that Truman (Jim Carrey, in not a ""serious"" role but one not nearly as silly as he's played before) is a genuine character, not artificially created.  Now, if this were all true and the movie evolved as it should have along these lines, perhaps it would deserve all the praise it is getting.  However, everything that happens in the later 2/3 of the movie completely undermines everything we've been lead to believe about this world Truman lives in. Imagine my utter disapointment when during what seemed like a truely emotional scene between Truman and his best friend, we cut to the control room to find the best friend being fed his lines!  What was that about not cue cards?  What follows completely destroys what was one a wonderful premise and gives no hope of redemption.  Even when Truman finally goes against the odds and attempts to escape the small island, it turns out to be a case of too little, too late.",The Truman Show

Those are one of the last lines of The Truman Show,  and     simply one of the best lines in the whole movie. Jim Carrey and Ed Harris takes us to an odyssey of moral issues; You can never think yourself as a God, because the more you believe it, the less your sons adore you. When I saw this film I was in the biggest state of awe i have ever been in a long time in a movie theater, I LOVE all the camera angles in every frame, the Director Photography must've had quite a lot headaches trying to satisfy Peter Weir demands, and in my opinion, deserves and Oscar, as well as the Editing, Art Direction, and Music. Not to mention the great performances by Ed Harris (who should've won the Oscar a long time ago) and Jim Carrey (the first time he actually attracts the audience not only by his jokes and charm but also by his heart). Many people disagree by the ending, the believe to be frivolous and incomplete, but I believe they are wrong, the whole movie IS THE TRUMAN SHOW, and after Truman leaves the set, THE SHOW IS OVER, that's the whole art of the issue, If we get to see him in the outside world, it would be some kind of sequel, not precisely THE SHOW.

It would have been far more interesting if it had gone somewhere and shown what happened next.  I was eager to see what was going to happen. But then it just ended.  There was such potential there, but instead we're just left with a pretty thin plot, not much more interesting or significant than the twilight zone episode it was based on.  Oh well.

626,WestAct,"Overrated, and only passably entertaining.",5,15 April 2000,"The Truman Show is easily one of the most overrated movies of the 1990s. While the premise is excellent, and a number of the supporting performers (especially Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich) do well in their roles, in any star-oriented film, the final judge of the movie's quality must be the star. Jim Carrey ultimately fails to deliver.  In yet another example of his unique, non-acting acting style, he manages to miss (or overshoot?) moments many other actors of lesser stature would hit dead on.  What could have been a very powerful movie dealing with the pressures of life and the changes of aging is ultimately reduced to a hollow, meaningless study of its star. Since the material does not allow Jim Carrey to do that at which he truly excels--outrageous physical comedy--he looks and feels very stiff and very miscast.

After the movie I was really impressed because Truman was actually living his whole life in a giant prison without knowing it.

629,ickyptang,"""The Truman Show"" is a masterpiece.",10,26 February 2000,"""The Truman Show"" was one of the true masterpieces to come out of the late 1990's.  One contributing factor being the dynamic performance by Jim Carrey, proving to his critics that he's not just a ""rubber-faced goon"". But despite Carrey's breakthrough, the film stands on it's own as something truly unique.  The script, by Andrew Niccol beautifully satirizes our television and media dominated era, incredibly being cynical and heartwarming at the same time.  The viewer is allowed to observe the ridiculous position Carrey's Truman Burbank is put in and at the same time care for the man, much like his millions of adoring ""cattle"".  While laughing at the ignorance of the apathetic world around Truman, one can not help but be fascinated by his story.  But the script is not the only genius. Peter Weir's stylishly executes  the story at a rapid pace, cramming so much into the film, and at the same time creating an entertaining and hypnotic movie.  The camera positions switch back and forth from an ""directorial"" standpoint to the ""hidden cameras"" all over Truman's world, giving a multitude of perspectives, and ultimately creating an amalgam of emotions.  ""The Truman Show""  walks the fine line between comedy and drama, even surpassing the typical ""dramedy"", designing a world all it's own, perfectly capturing the bizarre place Truman is stuck in.",The Truman Show
630,kaila1949,"Excellent, haunting movie",10,6 September 2000,"These comments might contain a spoiler, since they refer to the plot of the movie.  I first saw the Truman Show on its original run, and was intrigued - I found myself thinking about the movie days, weeks, months, later.  I recently bought the video and have seen it many times since.  I wish there had been more of the back story elements incorporated into the movie, but I agree with the decision to end it before Truman moves into the ""real world"". I am particularly interested in pinpointing exactly what Truman believes at each point of his discovery of the truth.",The Truman Show
631,khorasanimgn,an intelligent film,9,29 June 2019,"The Truman Show was made in 1998 by Peter weir and stared Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank. The movie is about a man whose life was created and managed by a director to broadcast every aspect of his life as a massive TV set. Actually, he had lived his entire existence in an extremely huge TV studio and had been surrounded by actors playing the parts of his family, friends and neighbors before he realized the truth and decided to live the spurious town called Seahaven.I would consider the movie as an intelligent and insightful one in which the actors presented outstanding and believable performances. The idea and plot seem to be completely original which are developed perfectly and can astonish everyone. The movie contains a great deal of symbols and metaphors which make the audience to reconsider and question every single scene and dialogue. Falling a light from the sky which was a part of the show equipment is a good example as it gives us the insight into the collapse of Truman's world. Also, the sea is the main symbol for both freedom and confinement. It represents confinement as it is so vast and Truman is too scared of water due to the fake death of his father in the sea which was planned by the director to frighten Truman to make him stay in the town. On the other hand, it represents freedom as it is the only way to leave the counterfeit town and enter the real world. Truman's final decision to face his fear and sail on the sea can implant this idea in audience's mind that in order to fulfill a dream and win over obstacles, we have to fight against our fears and limitations.Although it sometimes seems that some movies are paying less attention to the concept of life and using the most unimportant ideas to form a story, The Truman Show is a proof that there can be great and high-grade ideas that are able to be turned into masterpieces. The movie shares both comedy and dramatic moments and the depth of idea and used metaphors have created one of those movies that we can think and talk about when it ends.",The Truman Show

636,natebtt100,Unsung masterpiece,10,4 December 2006,"At the 71st Annual Academy Awards in 1999, Jim Carey jokingly expressed his woe and despair for not receiving and acting nomination for his performance in ""The Truman Show"". Humorous and good-natured as it was, I would not have been surprised if he actually felt that way, and furthermore, he would be right to. His portrayal of a man trapped within his own perception of reality was more than deserving of a nomination, and leads us once again to the age-old debate of the academy and its low success rate of selecting the most appropriate nominees and winners.Take a closer look and you'll realize that the same lack of attention from the academy applies to the whole film, let alone Carey. ""The Truman Show"" is one of the most stunningly original and creative films of the nineties; A clever satire, loaded with sharp wit and genuine drama from a carefully selected cast. If it has any flaw, it may be that it was too much of a clever satire, flying over the heads of an audience which was strongly infatuated with ""reality"" television.Still, for the picture's innovation and genius to be overlooked by the academy, which seems to be lost in its own perception of reality, is inexcusable and unfair, especially for Jim Carey, who may never get another opportunity like this again.Intriguing and compelling, ""The Truman Show"" deserved more respect than it got, and still does today.",The Truman Show
637,python-c,A Brilliant Movie with Brilliant Performances,10,20 August 2008,"I don't know what it was about this movie that made it so great. The direction itself was not incredible. The extras' performances weren't stellar. But what makes this a true American classic is its emotional connection. By the time it's finished, you'll be cheering for Truman (Jim Carrey) and feeling like you've known him your whole life--literally.The film's premise is simple but novel. Truman is a guy who lives in a world that's perfect--too perfect. As time goes on, he starts to suspect that something is wrong with that world. Clues begin popping up that eventually affirm his suspicion that all is not right, and for the rest of the film he sets about trying to fix that.Jim Carrey isn't usually my favourite guy, but in this movie, he was simply amazing. Likable, funny, and easy to empathise with, this is easily one of the best performances of his acting career. All of his main supporting actors are great too, and you'll recognise all of them.No matter what kind of person you are, no matter what kind of movies you like, ""The Truman Show"" will be enjoyable to you. I promise.",The Truman Show
638,Bigsmak,Watchable again and again and again,8,31 July 2006,"Have seen this movie a good few times now and I still love it.Plot (no spoiler)- Jim Carey plays the lovable Truman Burbank. He lives in a small, pleasant town where he has his daily routines and a sucky job in an insurance company. Well he thinks he does. In fact Truman is the star of the worlds biggest reality TV show. Adopted at birth by the TV company, he has been followed by camera his whole life and the world has watched him grow up. However Truman - starts to notice that all is not as it should be and this is where we join the film.This is a witty film without the ""IN YOUR FACE"" comedy that Carey has made his own over the last 10 years. He doesn't play it up and completely succeeds at making you feel for Truman as he wanders aimlessly through this Big Brother style prison. The rest of the cast are secondary to Jim as he carries the movie all by himself.This is a great film for a lazy Sunday evening when the fun for the weekend is over and Monday is looming up fast. Curl up on the couch with someone you love and let yourself become enveloped in the film. A bit of popcorn would come in handy as well.All in all, this is one of the most unique films I have ever, or will ever see. It should be required watching for all film buffs as there are so many references to other films in there.Will watch again!",The Truman Show
639,ahab19,A reality show that is actually real,10,8 August 2014,"""The Truman Show"" is a movie about a reality show and a world that is obsessed with watching it.This film addresses the voyeuristic quality in human beings. In the film, the main character of Truman lives his life unaware that his entire is being played out before the world. As it turns out, the world is captivated by him. In the year 2014 are a dime a dozen but back in 1998 the dawn of reality television was just beginning. Truman was before Kim Kardashian, Paris Hilton and countless others who lived their lives on television.Jim Carrey is so good in this role. In many ways he is ideally cast- a man who could not appear to be more ordinary on the outside but is so much bigger than the mundane world he is trapped in. Carrey's portrayal of Truman, who knows something is not right but can't figure it out, is both realistic and at times, appropriately over the top hysterical.The director is also what makes this film work. Peter Weir created this artificial world that looks seemingly normal and perfect. There are times where you as the viewer even forget that Truman's world is not real and actually looks like a nice place to live. But the truth eventually wins out as it catches up with Truman and even the best of shows eventually go off of the air.",The Truman Show
640,zane_ibrahim,Underrated movie as a result of bad timing...,10,25 January 2007,"The Truman Show was released straight after Jim Carrey had come out with funny movies like Ace Ventura, The Mask, Dumb and Dumber and Liar Liar - all basically back to back. I recall TTS being marketed as just another funny Jim Carrey movie and for this reason, and the fact that his previous popular movies were all very comical, general expectations were that it was the next laugh-out-loud Carrey movie with his unique style of pulling faces and elastic slap stick style comedy. I must say I didn't enjoy this movie so much when I first saw it in the cinema because I didn't appreciate the concept. I was also a teenager looking for the usual fun and laughs from watching a Carrey movie. But after having watched Carrey films that followed, such as Man on the Moon, The Majestic (a personal favourite) and Eternal Sunshine for the Spotless Mind, I appreciate what a fantastic actor the man is. His ability to play funny man is matched in his ability to be taken seriously. He should've had an Oscar in his hand ages ago, particularly for his performance in The Truman Show. I strongly believe that had this movie been released within the last couple of years, in the age of reality TV where more people would understand and relate to the concept, it would've received the appreciation it deserves and Carrey would've been nominated for an academy award. At the very least.",The Truman Show
641,Faimadio,Movies as psychotherapy?,5,21 March 2005,"This is one of many movies that were 'prescribed' to me by my shrink who believed in their effectiveness in therapy. At first I could not understand the connection between a film and a psychological problem. But then it became clear that both are about a 'fantasy'. Almost everyone in society is living a fantasy that can be as far removed or as close to reality as the person wishes. Of course, if the that person is a head of state dragging his country into war or running after Utopian dreams then the harm done is that much more greater.Now a film is also a fantasy, but it is the very exact and deliberate fantasy of the director. When we see a movie we are transported into that fantasy and we live it in vivid detail and color in all our visual and mental senses. We also live it in our subconscious senses as well, and herein lies its value. Seeing what has been thus far deeply embedded and intertwined inside us now on screen and out in the open helps begin the separation process (between reality and fantasy). Since the distinction between the fantasy of the movie and your current reality is very clear, and since you willingly entered the movie fantasy by your own choice until it overlapped with your inner similar fantasy; you can get to experience the willful 'exiting' of the movie fantasy that would subsequently help you to 'exit' your inner fantasy in the future. Well, it's a little more complicated than that, but this isn't the best place to discuss in deep psychotherapy techniques.Of course I'm not suggesting that, in and of its self, a movie would cure anybody of anything; that has to be the work of a professional, and it's his or her decision as to whether or not to incorporate it into the therapy process. But I am curious as to whether anyone else has ever 'used' this film (or any other movie) in this sense or at least experienced their psychological effect either consciously or subconsciously.",The Truman Show

He is quite serious in this which is what I like about this film as he is not just a goof like in Liar Liar which is a good film as well. The creator of the T.V. show Jim Carrey stars in is not quite right in the head in my opinion which is what makes this film in a way creepy.My mum said that I had to sit down and watch this as it was like a film that I was telling her about and that film was PLeasntville which again is another great film!!Truman Show=8/10,The Truman Show
643,gamzeyilmazcan8,fantastic!,10,22 December 2017,"The Truman Show is like a mirror of our postmodern world and the way we maintain our lives. How can we know that we are not being watched or controlled? The problem is that Truman has the courage and confidence to leave the world behind to chase after the truth and original. That doesn't mean that everyone has that courage. We are used to see the things as they are and we accept the world the way it is presented. Very few people try to find the meaning of our essence and how the truth can be found in the deep oceans. We know that the place Truman lives is a simulation, but when we turn and look our world we can't see any difference between Seaheaven and the world we live in. The bed we sleep; the chair we sit or the book we read are just a simulacrum. We don't attempt to look for the original because the copies become the reality and that doesn't bother us at all. Truman Burbank is the man who cannot make shift with the visible or knowable, he is brave and courageous enough to look for the light and truth.",The Truman Show
644,Jayteasee,"MIGHTY IMPACT - not as a comedy, but a sort of a horror scenario!",10,28 July 2008,"So, I had my first experience with The Truman Show, 10 years after it was made, and man, the impact! Someone's going to say I took it too seriously, but I guess that's the way it is then.The reason that I didn't go see this movie before is that it had Jim Carrey written all over it. I have grown to dislike Jim Carrey for the very reason for which he is the star he is - pulling faces! I believe I'm not the only one who has been wondering whether it's all that he's good for. It works for The Mask and Ace Ventura... but a lot of others? I don't know.Having that said, I spent a few moments trying to think who else could have pulled this one off. Carrey kind of reminds me of Jack Nicholson. Every other actor sort of pale next to Nicholson and Carrey... They do the conventional acting thing while these two do their own thing. So props for that.I believe this movie was labeled a comedy just because of Jim Carrey and that he's supposed to be a comedian. However, this movie didn't strike me as a comedy. Instead, I was scared, disturbed.Everybody laments over how money makes the world turn around. Underneath, this movie offers a point of view on that: How far can that actually be taken? Surely, The Truman Show is an exaggeration on the subject... it also simultaneously exaggerates the fact that people don't care as long as they get their fix. Moreover, the fact that people don't care! There's even a part in the movie where it's freely discussed in the media, like it was okay to make a lab rat out of Truman Burbank. McElhone's character Sylvia/Lauren voices criticism and points out how cruel it is. (In my opinion, it's critical for the success of this movie. Props again.) And in the very end Christoph, the director, is brought on almost as if he was a God... and there's no denying that he's playing a God!Alright, I've said a lot, but if you guys are thinking I'm slamming this movie, you've mistaken. Read on.I feel that this movie has very little comedy value. Surely, some aspects of it are brought across by means of comedy, but that still doesn't make it one. However, I feel that's not important, though. I feel that it gives you something to think about, if you scratch a bit deeper than the surface.And therein lies the greatness of the movie, worth of the 10 stars I gave it.",The Truman Show

There is nothing I would do to change it. I came away from 'The Truman Show' feeling inspired which is the goal of good filmmaking Jim Carrey was outstanding as Truman, underplaying him, not making him too comic or too dramatic, but giving true sincerity when asked. He deserved an Oscar nomination. Ed Harris has always been a good actor, but in this movie he's a great actor. He plays Christof with such arrogance and bullheadedness that you don't know whether he's helping or destroying Truman. He and the director, Peter Weir, deserved their Oscar nods.",The Truman Show

Television has been a sector player since its invention since the day it has walked on the arm with a cannon, and has often been on the back of the movie theater. Cinema, on the other hand, uses a lot of the ""blessings"" of television (a). As a matter of fact, the cinema has occasionally attempted to take revenge on television. We can say that some of these initiatives give immortal artifacts to cinema history. It is certainly not exaggerated to say that THE TRUMAN SHOW, one of the master pieces of Peter Weir, is one of the most important pieces of these works. Truman show tells a person who has met his fake identity in an isolated environment as if he tells Sommerset Mills that he never knew his name in the movie SE7EN and he says ""they follow us all, they look at what books we have taken from the library and analyze us"" Truman Show is a production with only a few movies in fact.",The Truman Show

You know that the plot is about 'true man' Burbank, discovering that his whole life is a TV show and that everyone he knows is, in fact, an actor, paid to let him think his life is 'heaven on earth'. Why is it scary? The Truman Show is about the ultimate conspiracy. A conspiracy that can actually pull it off for 30 years of this man's life. Creating a make believe world where nothing is even close to what it looks like. And it IS believable. In Truman's world, about 5000 cameras are positioned around the gigantic set. Although the government-is-watching-you-scare is now less than it used to be, our lives are becoming more and more public. Not in the least because of this great Internet. But mainly because media is bringing everyone much closer to each other and giving us the opportunity to know much more than before; Making information available on every subject possible.

653,LeTiss,TV movie,7,28 June 1999,"Supposedly, this was the film Jim Carrey needed to make. That as may be but was he really the right man for the job. Carrey has carved a career as a rubber faced comic actor who acts at the top of his voice a lot, but the Truman Show demands he portray what at first seems a mid-life crisis but later develops into full paranoia, albeit justified.Meet Truman Burbank. He is the future of television. His show beams around the world 24 hours a day. Everyone loves Truman. People collect Truman memorabilia and videos. He has theme bars named after him. But Truman Burbank does not know any of this. He lives in a world populated by principal actors and extras. Truman's life is a carefully orchestrated soap opera. Controlled that is until he becomes dissatisfied with life and wants to move away from the sleepy island he calls home. His repeated failure to get away arouses his suspicion that his life is not his own.There are many faults in The Truman Show. For instance, onscreen the show's creator Christophe tells us the reason Truman is so popular with the audience is because his life is idyllic. Yet the character we meet is an insurance salesman living in fifties America. No offence intended to our American cousins, but it is never really explained why this irritatingly twee view of America should cross international cultural boundaries.Another down side are the unsympathetic characters on display. This is surely due to the fact that everyone is playing a character who is playing a character. The only genuine person is Truman and he is played by Jim Carrey and, worse, has led a life so mind-numbingly normal as to be almost abnormal.The good thing about The Truman Show is that the concept is very strong. Director Peter Weir brilliantly keeps up the Twilight Zone-style paranoia and the film is very well scripted. Despite being generally irritating, Carrey is not a disaster in the role and he does encourage you to sympathise with Truman.Most of the philosophy spun regarding our TV watching generation comes across as a bit hackneyed, however the final scene of the movie sums up telly addicts the world over.",The Truman Show

Jim definitely shows his acting abilities as a persona other than comedy.  The idea of this movie is just extraordinary.  And the climax and resolution of this dramatic movie is wounderful.

We are able to experience how Truman has his doubts about everything that he knows since he was born, as well as Christoff, a character that is so far away from the reality that thinks he is able to create a world in which Truman won't be able to experience things that aren't necessarily good from the real world and life.At the end of the film, Truman decides that he cannot live inside a tv set that doesn't even get close to how the real world is, and is very often more sweet and soft that it should be for him.He decides to face how the planet Earth really is and wants to have a normal life.Our lifes aren't really private even if we want to think the opposite.We must face that privacy is no longer something that you can have on the digitalized society in which we live in.Maybe the only privacy that humans have are on their pictures that aren't uploaded to the internet, or the feelings that we write on a diary, but thats about it.",The Truman Show

I would not doubt it if someone starts out saying that the movie is dull, pointless and absolutely dumb, and finishes the film saying that it was the best movie they have ever seen. The acting is totally different than anything I have ever seen, and the directing has the Kubrick feeling. Truly amazing accomplishment in film.",The Truman Show

It even has some comedy in it that fits into the movie very well.Had to take off a star because there was a thought bugging me the whole time I was watching: did he really not notice that something was off until he was an adult? Or did he just repress the feeling?",The Truman Show

665,magy-4,Interesting and inspirating movie with many strange things.,8,25 December 2020,"Truman show is very interesting movie. In some sort one of his kind. Unique idea and script, hardly can found in any another movie. Which is pretty amazing just by itself.
Story is pretty plain - TV corporation adopt newborn just for create 24 hours uninterrupted TV show about his whole life.
The town, where he grown and live is one giant TV studio. All people around, whole town population are actors. Fake parents, fake emotions, fake job, fake friends, fake ""fate"". Everything in his life is secretly controlled by TV visionary Christof, including what woman he have to start dating and marry.
It's quite interesting, that despite Christof saying in first line ""We've become bored with watching actors give us phony emotions."" and then ""there's nothing fake about Truman himself. No scripts, no cue cards."", practically everything in movie contradict his statement. Everything is phony and fake. So much resemblance with our life and world around us, isn't?
However, despite such uniqueness, or maybe exactly because of that, there are too many plot holes. After deep analyze, such thing as 24hrs TV show of whole life one person, whom have no idea about that, couldn't really exist not even survive. Especially financially. Interesting moments from Truman life shown in movie looks fine, but if his whole life would be transmitted over 3 decades while show is on the run, those few interesting moments would be spread over that time so rarely, that hardly enough people would watch such boredom show, not even speak about financial aspect.",The Truman Show
666,lizzy_knight,Realistic to the end.,7,29 February 2012,"A man's entire life is a show put on by a rather selfish, rich director. The director builds an entire island set for Truman to live on, complete with a whole island of actors. The film is based around Truman breaking free of this fake life and realising he has been living a lie. I thought it was a very unique and realistic film, hugely enjoyable with just the right amount of funny and tense. Jim Carrey does a surprisingly serious performance and Ed Harris does a unnervingly good performance too. The abrupt ending gave added realism to the film because it coincides with the whole theme of life and how real or fake life and people really are. Overall a imaginative film pulled off rather surprisingly well.",The Truman Show

668,listenwithinyourself,Warning to mankind hidden in the The Truman Show,10,30 December 2012,"The Trueman Show could be a warning through film, similarly to The Wizard of Oz and how that was used to tell a more important story and is not merely entertainment but a warning to humanity, if we are prepared to see it. The Trueman Show is one example of many other films sending out this warning.Truman Burbank represents ""the people"" while the actors (bystanders, friends and family of Truman) on the ground are the ""gatekeepers"" of the ""illuminate"" who are hiding in the hollowed out moon. The audience may be alien intelligence (who in the movie some of which get on the ""set"" (inside Trumans world) to interact with Truman, could be representative of aliens interacting with us) watching us from another dimension or from ""above"", or might just be us the viewers looking into the ""looking glass"" (TV).His name says a lot and is like an overview of the whole meaning, Trueman is true + man = truth for man, while Burbank is Bur (prickly/thorn) + Bank (money/power) = corrupt elite or illuminate, therefore Truman v Burbank = right v wrong or good v bad etc.I believe the warning could be to inform ""the people"" who are prepared to see it for what it really is, that if we can overcome our fear of living we can set ourselves free from the illusion of our controlled reality and if we don't then we remain in bondage, as shown in the movie where Trueman overcomes his fear of the water (water represents the essence of all life, so he fears life or living) to eventually escape at the edge of his ""prison"". Truman's fear of the water was constructed through events orchestrated by his controllers and is a mirror of how humanity has been left in a state of fear through controlled and manipulated staged events.There is a screen shot of a view that appears to be a pyramid and is one of many examples of ""illuminate"" symboling used in the movie. Truman is in his car at the bottom of the pyramid, to get to the top he has to overcome his fear of the water by crossing the bridge. The sign post on the right looks like a police badge outline which is a reminder of control, and the light at the top of the lamp post representing the ""eye"". The long yellow line in the middle could be a reference to the yellow brick road from the Wizard of Oz.Andrew Niccol the producer and writer of The Truman Show also directed and was the writer for Gattaca made one year before, which has an interesting link as this is about how to overcome and beat the PTB in an Orwellian society through overcoming fear to achieve the ultimate goal for the main character Vincent Freeman of escaping earth, which is the same goal for Truman Burbank.",The Truman Show
669,kulpank,A good entertainer,8,6 July 2013,"The Truman Show The film is part satire, part comedy. The recent shows like Big brother etc. work on similar concept. This movie takes it a step further. It creates a whole fake city, a whole alternative controlled life. Though over the top, it makes you stop and wonder 'What if'.The movie is about Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) whose whole life is a Television show and he is unaware of it. It is about his journey from ignorance to slow perception. The film plot though in modern times is not very new, with the recent onslaught of reality TV but it does have its moments of clarity. Jim Carrey has once again proved that not just outrageous comedy or dark thriller roles are his forte but a serious mix of the two is also up his alley. He has managed to hook the audience. You find yourself rooting for him for the escape at the same time hoping to catch more of his drama. Ed Harris (Christof) as the creator of the show is again brilliant. Through fewer words he emotes more. His attachment to Truman as the father figure, as the creator is almost tangible. Though Jim carries the movie through seeing as he is in every shot, he got good support from Laura Linney,Noah Emmerich actors. They have managed to capture a fine line between scripted characters and real people.Overall, It is a simple unassuming film, which is thought provoking on many levels but still remains a thorough entertainment.",The Truman Show
670,cariboolean,Fun but far too many gaping holes even for a fantasy,4,17 August 2008,"There's a point at which some works of fiction ask you to convert the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" which we must bring to any fictional work into ""throwing all critical faculties completely to the winds"", and that's what happens here. This film is mildly entertaining for a while..until you start actually thinking about some of what it asks you to take for granted. 1. Weather on demand. While we've all seen wave making pools, has anyone actually seen the technology to create violent localized storms? (While there are some who claim the ""secret"" government has such weather control technology, even they supposedly can only do it over a large area.) On a sound stage, this could only have been done with giant fans and large, obvious water-spewing machinery. Where were the fans and the other machinery? Or are we supposed to believe all that weather just came out of thin air? 2. Ventilation. With all the car exhaust and heat generated by the community and the artificial lighting, there obviously would have to be giant air conditioning systems (remember, the dome was supposed to be a closed, sealed location) to dissipate the heat and provide fresh air. Where were all the giant vents that would've been needed? The a/c equipment? The constant noise that large a/c equipment generates? 3. Wouldn't Truman have noticed that there were never any airplanes or helicopters seen flying anywhere? Wouldn't he have asked ""why don't we have any aircraft here?"" I can't think of any ""excuse"" for that which would have been even remotely plausible. 4. For this ""community"" to have gone on so long, it would've meant that all of Truman's ""schoolmates"" weer actors who grew up there along with him. Does anyone really think that so many children (actors, no less) could have kept such a big secret for so many years? Come on, now! You can bet that more than one kid over all that time would've felt the need to spill the beans. 5. Laura Linney's character was initially shown as a cheerleader. That means that the island's high school played competitive sports with other schools. So...does that mean they NEVER played an ""away"" game?? Wouldn't Truman have thought that to be a little strange? And would all of the opposing team's athletes have agreed to be bought off and keep silent? How much money would it have cost to buy the silence of those kids, in addition to all of those mentioned in 4. above? No t.v. show would have been able to marshal the huge budget necessary to pull all of this off on an ongoing basis -- not to mention the huge budget just to pay all of the hundreds of actors. 6. All t.v., radio, magazines, newspapers, movies and internet (yes, internet existed when this movie was made) coming to the island would have had to be censored of any references to The Truman Show. There's no way a t.v. network would be able to exercise such total control. Truman would have noticed that the only media were locally generated. Wouldn't he have asked why he was cut off from everything else? 7. Even if the supposed explanation that he was adopted by a corporation was valid, the moment he was restrained from free movement of any kind the corporation (and thus Christof) was committing the felony of kidnapping -- a federal crime which wouldn't have been excused. 8. There were even internal inconsistencies..e.g., ""Christof"" said in the Harry Shearer interview that all revenues for the show were generated by product placement. If that's so, then why did ""Meryl"" have to hold up various products to the camera and deliver spiels? 9. We're supposed to believe that ""Meryl"" was so upset by some of the manifestations of Truman's waking-up process that she breaks into tears and claims she ""can't work under these conditions, it's not professional"". But at the same time, we're supposed to believe that living for years in a sham marriage with a man she doesn't love (and presumably, routinely having sex with him) was perfectly okay with her, simply because it was a paid gig! That's pretty cold, even for Hollywood.",The Truman Show
671,fdarcy,The best movie of the last decade,10,8 June 2005,"""The Truman Show"" is probably one of the most underrated movies ever. It was a success at the time, and it got some Oscar nominations, but somehow it didn't get the recognition it deserves. When I say to friends the sentence in the title of this comment, I usually get a reaction between laughter and astonishment. It is much easier to pick Scorcesa's movies, and to prefer De-Nero over Jim Carrie, that absurd comedian.Why is this movie so underrated? One reason may be the identity of the hero, and the disbelief that the star of ""Ice Ventura"" can be part of a masterpiece. Another reason may be that people find it hard to believe that a film can be both entertaining, and funny, and light in character, and yet deep and sophisticated. And maybe the reason is the prejudice against what is ""Holiwoodic"". Whatever the reasons are, they are wrong. Truman is a movie that should be watched again and again, and to those who will do it, a very enjoyable experience is promised.To make things short, I will skip the obvious details (such as acting, directing etc.) and move to the most important stuff, and that is: what was the movie trying to say. There are three levels of meaning in the movie. The first is a satire of the current media, predicting the current trend of ""reality TV"". This level is obvious enough not to discussed thoroughly.The second level is a subject dealt with quite a lot in our era: the tension between ""high"" and ""low"" art, or between art and kitsch. While Truman is a film beautifully designed, ""The Truman show"" is not only a bizarre TV show, but also an extremely low-standard show. Anything around Truman's life is a kitsch, and this is a paradox which is in the basis of the movie. In addition, the movie brilliantly moves between the ""inside"" and ""outside"", between the atmosphere of the movie and of the TV series. Philip Glass' music has an extremely important part in that, making this movie an outstanding example for the importance of film music.The third level is in my opinion the most interesting, and that is the religious one. The creator-created relations between Truman and The director, which holds the name ""Chrostoph"" are clearly of religious context. But it takes several views of the movie to see that these relations are really what the movie talks about, and are apparent in almost every scene. Many questions arise from that topic, and they are dealt with brilliantly, with the climax of the last minutes. One does not expect a light Hollywood comedy to be a deep theological essay, but that is exactly what ""The Truman Show"" is. Go and see for yourselves.",The Truman Show
672,Boheme97,The Triumph of Free Will,10,24 May 2005,"There is something very emotionally affecting when you watch someone slowly start to realize that they are caged. How Truman was totally controlled by a corporation. What they insisted to call real, yet controlled. It was controlled in that this young boy's (Truman) father was taken away from him, he was deprived the joys of growing up with a father, not because it was his father's time to go, but because a board of advisers thought it would be good drama, and would help to keep him where he was. In their prison. It doesn't matter that Seahaven Island might in fact be the greatest place on Earth, and that the real world is ""this sick place"". Truman should still be afforded the luxury of choice that we all have. And when you consider that he didn't even get to choose the girl that he married, it makes you feel that much more for him. And I think there is SOME truth to the statement that ""We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented."" At least, Christof wasn't so blind that he actually realized, ""He could leave anytime, if this was more than just a vague ambition, if he really truly wanted to leave, there's no way we could stop him."" He was right. The line that I believe defines this movie, ""We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented.""

All seems normal as ever until Truman has an epiphany when strange things start to become more noticeable. He begins to realize that his whole life has been recorded and podcasted as a worldwide hit TV show. Nothing is real anymore and Truman must confront his every fear to learn the truth. Its a mind-boggling tail that sort of makes you wonder if your life is a TV show and people are watching your every movement.

The problem is that Jim has played so many comedies that a semi-sweet role isn't really approved by the common public. In my opinion he is still very funny and plays Truman very well. The question for The Truman Show isn't did Jim Carrey play his role well or not, rather, it be is the satire to this film too realistic to how American minds think. The director Peter Weir does a very good job making fun of us. He shows through comedy, triumph, and weakness how to advertise. The way that Weir makes fun of reality TV makes all Americans look like cruel idiots. The Truman Network that people watch almost 24/7, is pop culture at its weakest. This is saying right there that we are sort of interdependent to it. Also it proves Foreign countries opinion that Americans are lazy by showing people of all ages watching The Truman Show.

681,thecynicalone,Simply Incredible,10,15 February 1999,"I was very disappointed to see that The Truman Show did not get a nomination for best picture. This film is, in one word, INCREDIBLE. Peter Weir's masterpiece gives us a dark, multi layered satire of a media obsessed, voyeuristic society.Many accuse The Truman Show of being a ""one trick pony,"" but they are wrong. Paradoxily, to really ""get"" The Truman Show, you have to see the big picture. If you analyze every bit of the film, it becomes repetitive. And that's the point. The majority of the people in the world DO NOT analyze films to death..what you see is what you get. And that's how you have to view The Truman Show. What makes it so amazing is that it satirizes (albeit DARKLY) so many unlikely cultural staples: gated communities, the viewing audience and media stardrom. Yet... you can't really see this unless you look at the film as a whole. Anyone understand what I mean? Jim Carrey gives us a wonderfully restrained, yet manic performance as Truman Burbank. Ed Harris' megalomanical Christof also adds greatly to the film. My one complaint? Overly saccahrine Meryl. Although I suppose that goes along with the satire. One of my favorite films ever.

Jim Carey did a phenomenal job... of course having a fantastic director like  Peter Weir does not hurt! Weir does a wonderful job of using his actors in ways that surprises you. Holland Taylor does a great job as a woman who ""loves"" her son even though she is just acting...Laura Linney is incredible was the long suffering actress that must play Truman's wife... and Noah Emmerich does a wonderful job as Truman's best friend when in reality he is Truman's worst enemy. This movie is truly disturbing because in this media driven world that we live in it is not that big a stretch of the imagination that the networks would try something like this... or that we would all watch it whether we admitted it or not...

690,john.brady,Intriguing premise but overrated,6,26 August 2005,"The Truman Show has an intriguing premise - a reality TV show whose star is oblivious of the proceedings, believing it to be real life.Jim Carrey turns in a strong performance as a man who ultimately realises that his whole life has been a sham. His growing awareness that all is not well is effectively essayed, and a long way from his previous OTT comic roles.There are effective moments - the jarring product placements for the benefit of viewers, the reappearance of the father that Truman believed drowned as a child - but once the premise is established it all becomes rather predictable, and the satire rapidly tails off.For a much more effective (and more prescient) satire on TV, I'd recommend ""The Year of the Sex Olympics"". Ignoring its low budget and certain dated aspects of its production, it is far more thought-provoking.In the final analysis, ""The Truman Show"" would have worked better as an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" and without the needless chase and escape scene at the end.",The Truman Show

692,SparksterInc,"Great Idea, Not-So-Great Execution",7,10 May 2001,"I loved the concept of the movie.  The idea of a reality show based on one man's life and following each and every of his moves was brilliant, especially when you consider how millions of viewers are attracted to today's ""reality"" programs, such as ""Survivor"".  I believe this movie alone may have paved the way for some of today's shows and were inspired by real-life shows that preceded the film, most notably MTV's ""The Real World"". When it's done properly, you get a movie which centers around a man who begins to question what is real in life and what's not as the world that he is raised in begins to unravel.  Two major problems, however, plagued what could have been an instant classic.The first is the lifeless reactions of the viewers.  To me, the film portrays the viewers mostly as people who sacrifice their own lives to watch someone else's.  Now I know this is true in the lives of millions, but even for a phenomenon like ""The Truman Show"", a show will also have millions of critics, although not as many as there are supporters.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I saw there was only one standout skeptic who understood the whole thing, and there were many more who shared the same views but were not seen or heard at all.The second and the most unforgivable error was the ending, which I felt was an anti-climatic conclusion to a movie that built up a great deal of drama before it.  The ending was terribly written and did not have much depth or thought into it, and its closure was much more predictable than it should've been.  I'm not asking for much;  I just wanted a final conflict featuring the best and worst of both sides, which I felt didn't happen.All in all, a 7 rating in my opinion may be a bit sympathetic, but I felt they did everything else so well, only that it deserved better.  It featured Jim Carrey expanding his talent and playing his role almost to a tee, backed by a strong supporting cast, and featured a good plot outline and great scenery.  I would still recommend this film to anyone, but I would keep in mind the two significant flaws that kept this movie from joining the ranks of the elite.",The Truman Show

694,lucy-95505,A Reality Shift,9,27 April 2020,"The Truman Show is one of my favourite films of all time. I think that even though it's fairly simple to follow the story, there are layers beneath the surface. There are so many stories in this film that are unexplored, and a lot of major pieces of the story are hidden in the background of shots or barely referenced. Something that I feel is a major part of the film is the activist movement, led by Silvia, to free Truman. However, we barely get a glimpse at her work, only hearing about it through her phone conversation with Cristof, and seeing the countless 'Free Truman' banners, posters, and memorabilia in her apartment. We don't know the extent of what she's done to free him, and that's a layer that I think really adds to the film. Another layer is that nearly every person shown watching the show is absolutely thrilled to see Truman escape. Other than Cristof, no one is upset or angry. It begs the question, why did they watch the show in the first place? If the general public was happy that Truman escaped, did they already believe that his imprisonment was wrong? And if they knew that the show was inhumane, why did they watch it in the first place, and buy Truman merchandise? My theory is that, well, people are lazy. I think the general public assumed that eventually, Cristof and his team would give up and set Truman free. The two security guards at the end of the film sum it up very well- 'What else is on?' They don't really care about Truman's life. TV is TV to them, and seeing someone escape after being lied to for thirty years is great TV!
I think that the Truman Show has an incredible story, and the imagery, style, and cinematography has stuck with me for years (since I first watched it). Truman's last scene, where his boat hits the wall of the dome and he walks on the 'horizon' is breathtaking. The combination of the impact of the story and the beautiful colours of the cinematography makes it a truly iconic scene. Another feat of technical excellence in the Truman Show, in my opinion, is the way that almost every shot feels like it came from a hidden camera somewhere near Truman. You can tell when a shot or angle comes from a camera hidden on a person, like in a tie or brooch, or when someone carries a camera, like the old man with the garbage bin.
In the second half of the film, Cristof becomes a major character. He is the creator of the Truman Show, and, in his eyes, a god. However, not everyone sees it that way. Because people around the world are cheering for Truman's escape, they must hate the person keeping him imprisoned. Cristof is the villain to Truman and the viewer, which includes the viewers of the Truman Show in the film, and us, the viewers of the film.
As Truman's world begins to unravel, Cristof is hurrying to try and put it back together. Throughout, he remains nonchalant and almost boasts about his creation. When asked why Truman has never figured it out, Cristof says 'We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.' I believe that this statement is very true, especially for someone who grew up in that world and that reality. When, as a child, you are presented with a world, you will be curious about it, but before long you accept that it is real. We accepted the reality of our world just as Truman did, but how do we know we're not part of a bigger-scale secret reality TV show?
Our world isn't that great, and there are several realities that I wish could be changed. Our current reality may seem a little similar to Truman's; we cannot leave our homes or towns, but that's where the similarities end. After this is over, it will be strange to go out into the world and see what has changed. After Truman leaves the show, he'll have a hard time adjusting, just like we will.
These shifts in reality have huge impacts on us, which I think is another layer of the film that really adds to it, making this a film I would enjoy watching over and over.",The Truman Show
695,rilemadi,What is reality?,9,27 April 2020,"If a child is told that the sky is purple, they will believe that it is purple, until they figure out that it is blue. I feel that this analogy rings true to life, as it is the previous views, that often corrupt the present ones, that are yet to be known. But what if the context of this analogy wasn't political? What if this analogy referred to every day of your life? We see this all the time in movies, but I believe, that the best example of this, is through the film The Truman Show. Personally, I would call this production a film as you come out of it with a slightly altered view of the world. Not only do you start to look at things differently, but I found myself second guessing if the things that I have always known were real. Although this was not my first time watching the film, I would rate it a 9/10. I have always really enjoyed the film because I love its concept and its play on reality. Above this, I believe that the Truman Show is in fact an incredible mixture of cinematography, and the perfect story. As previously mentioned, I love the films concept, but the film wouldn't be the same without its unique cinematography, as the camera often times takes the place of those that are filming Truman for the show. This is something that you rarely see in movies, and I think that it added an extra sense of individuality to the concept. To further push the main message of the film, each element of the production comes together to confirm the concept that we accept the reality of the world with which we're presented. Personally, I highly agree with this statement. This goes along with upbringing, to simply believing in the facts that we as a society have presented as our truth. That being said, sometimes reality can be a toxic thing. In the past, people were told that certain individuals were not equal to others due to their sexuality, gender, or race. Unfortunately, this implementation of reality has stuck in the brains of many, and admitting the wrong in what we previously saw as true proves to be a challenging thing to overcome as a society. This is ultimately the danger of reality. That being said, sometimes it's not up to us to shift reality. Sometimes reality shifts on us. The Covid-19 crisis has changed our world and ultimately changed our version of reality for the remaining months this year. Although terrible, this crisis isn't all bad, as urging people to stay inside has started to help heal the planet and put an end to our on going environmental issues. As seen in the film, many bad things can be seen with two sides. I feel as though the film does the best job in showing this through the incorporation the character Christof, who is the creator of the Truman show. Christof is seen as a hero to the viewers and marketers of the show, as he has provided them with 24/7 entertainment, and sponsored several products in the process, their for taking the place of adds that would normally be on television. On the contrary, he is seen as a villain to Truman, and those who do not agree with the show. As Truman sees it, he has stolen his life and forced him to live a lie for over 30 years. Ultimately, not only does the movie come down to reality, but perspective. Everything, and anything can be seen in different ways. So, what is reality really?",The Truman Show

Whenever I want to refer to some very deep problems of epistemology and other things, ""The Truman Show"" is a quick way of saying a lot. There are even deeper ways of going at these problems, but ""The Truman Show"" is short and sweet. And it's fun! ""The Prisoner"" TV series goes further, but it's also more obscure. The relevant philosophers are even less accessible to lay persons. But just about anybody can ""get"" being hoodwinked by malefactors who fake up something, like they sometimes think man never landed on the moon but the moon landing was in a Hollywood studio.

The worst part is when the lamp falls down from the sky at the start, as the whole suspense of the movie is given away. Theres now no questioning the direction of the movie, and from here it's just waiting for him to realise the obvious, which takes a long time since he has low cognitive development, about the level of a 12 y/o child.I can imagine how this would have blow my mind 20 years ago, or as a child, but with the kind of movies out now a days like interstellar and inception, this is more intellectually akin to a children's movie.

The first time you see the movie you know something isn't right and it is really intriguing and mysterious as you go on a journey as a viewer to unravel the truth. How come the IMDb plot and storyline give this to the viewer and actually declare that he is already in a T.V. show. It is so much more enjoyable to watch this not knowing anything and discovering it for the first time. As I really like the film I have watched it more than once but the first time being clueless about the T.V. show made the film highly memorable and much more entertaining.

703,flowair,"'Somebody help me, I'm being spontaneous!'",9,23 June 2004,"Truman is an authentic man in a false world.Truman Burbank, insurance broker, thinks he's living a normal life. However, his life is technically fake, falsely created and showcased on international TV. His wife, Meryl, and acquaintances, Marlon, are all actors and it's all for himself. You're watching The Truman Show, a first hand experience of extreme reality TV. On air and unaware.Jim Carrey (The Cable Guy, Ace Ventura) acts in an extraordinary, straight role as the unsuspecting Truman and, surprisingly, gives us a commonsensical and elegant performance. The bigoted view of Carrey is not a respected view, but The Truman Show hosts the verification that Carrey in actual fact can act without throwing himself around the set. I couldn't possibly see another actor playing Truman by any means. Jim Carrey has the enthusiasm of a child and something which on no account lets you disregard him, corresponding Truman.Ed Harris' amazing feat as Christof completes the movie's stratagem. Harris has an imperative role as the originator of Truman's world and the administrator of the show. Christof, who theoretically plays God, directs the Truman Show and creates story lines. As this God figure he guides Truman through a false life, introducing fresh citizens and unscrambling predicaments as a quantity of plots go wrong. Christof's control room is an impressive element of the movie, as you see hundreds of monitors concerning various cameras, a large screen overlooking the entire room and even computers which manage the habitat's weather and have power over daylight.The motion picture's plot is an, appreciatively, clear plot. The viewer watches The Truman Show similar to if it is a normal channel on television. concealed cameras first lead you throughout Truman's regular day as an insurance broker, stumbling across people he recognizes and being involved in subtle product placements. Yet, another day he meets his Father who, Truman believed, drowned after boating in a storm (this was a clever way to make Truman petrified of water so he can not escape from Seahaven). Unexpectedly, Truman's Father is taken away by unsystematic people and Truman is left bewildered. Feelings of a previous love-at-first-site, who broke in to the Seahaven studio, confound him more, believing she was taken to Fiji. Truman, in conclusion, decides he will getaway from Seahaven and escape, oblivious that he's in a film studio.The production begins with introducing the appealing concept of actors. Instead of opening by introducing the authentic actor's names, they are specified two names in the motion picture. for instance, Meryl, Truman's wife in the show, is named Hannah Gill in the real world. This tells us that merely Truman, who's name by opportunity can be pronounced as True-Man) is authentic in Seahaven. As well as these, a succinct interview with the show's foremost actors explains The Truman Show.The Truman Show is based on reality TV and has an analogous perception to Big Brother. Seahaven, Truman's home town (fashioned for Truman by Christof) has approximately 5000 cameras, several as minuscule as a pin head. The cameras are located where Truman can be seen perpetually. Cameras are even in the most incongruous places, like Truman's office pencil sharpener, in addition to a dog collar. George Orwell's 1984 can strongly be compared to The Truman Show, with the concept of someone being watched all the time and being trapped in one place, in Truman's case, stuck in Seahaven. The issue of voyeurism can also be concerned within The Truman Show, and if a program of such correspondence should actually be aired devoid of Truman's authorization. The Truman Show is a tremendous film for the whole family, and can be enjoyed even after the 103 minutes. Issues concerning such a product being created in our lives can be safely debated with your family. A second watch is also recommended, as many new features are unlocked after the end is revealed.",The Truman Show
704,RandolfCarter,An insulting piece of cowardice,1,31 July 2005,"What we have here is a film with great potential. Potential to become one of the great dystopian films. It raises such themes as a nation obsessed by television, the means used to provide people their purile ""entertainment"" without any consideration of ethics nor human dignity. Truman could be a great tragedy. We could see one man live a meaningless life, forever watched by millions of big brothers, completely unaware of his fishbowl existence. A warning, pointing to the disconnect and disassociation we all experience upon seeing someone on a television screen. And also to our slavish instinct to glorify these people without knowing why we adore them.And I can't help but think of this when I see all the thousands of mediocrities line up to make complete fools of themselves on national TV on so-called ""reality"" shows all in the name of a few brief and unmemorable moments of ""fame"". We've been brainwashed by the media into believing that fame it itself, is a desirable virtue.But this movie, instead of exploring these issues in depth, skirts around them, afraid of giving itself intellectual depth and weight. Instead were treated to Jim Carey's charming smile and empty acting. This film has the potential to be a memorable and in-depth dystopian vision of fame and the media. Instead, out of pure cowardice, its turned into another meaningless popcorn movie. A complete waste of celluloid. All the people involved in this should be ashamed of themselves.",The Truman Show

This is your first clue that you are watching something different from your normal Jim Carrey movie. I love the dialogue, camera shot, performances, direction, music, and running time of this movie. There is nothing I would do to change it. I came away from 'The Truman Show' feeling inspired which is the goal of good filmmaking Jim Carrey was outstanding as Truman, underplaying him, not making him too comic or too dramatic, but giving true sincerity when asked. He deserved an Oscar nomination. Ed Harris has always been a good actor, but in this movie he's a great actor. He plays Christof with such arrogance and bullheadedness that you don't know whether he's helping or destroying Truman. He and the director, Peter Weir, deserved their Oscar nods.Weir, who directed the great 'Witness', uses different camera angles to make you feel like you're actually watching 'The Truman Show' and not a movie. He ends it before you get tired of the concept and helped Carrey and Harris give immaculate performances. Andrew Niccol script is a real star in the movie too because of it's inventiveness and ingenuity. Overall, 'The Truman Show' is what I like to call a true American classic.",The Truman Show
706,connorx221,"A heartfelt, excellent journey of self discovery",10,4 April 2016,"I came across The Truman Show a few years back. I had heard about it and knew it starred Jim Carrey, so I assumed it was another comedy, full of Jim Carrey being....well, Jim Carrey.Boy, what a punch to the gut. When I saw Truman Show, it stuck with me for days. To this day, I easily call it one of my all time favorite films.The film, with a pretty simple plot, is entertaining from start to finish. Although billed as a comedy/drama, this is without a doubt a drama.Carrey's performance here is absolutely astonishing. He plays an extremely likable, average joe working for an insurance company, albeit the star of his own TV show, which he doesn't know.The acting is top notch, and the film itself is emotional and spine tingling. Add to that excellent direction, strong supporting performances, and a beautiful score and you have one hell of a film.That being said, the film itself belongs to Carrey. He carries the film with such ease and emotion, trying to find himself in the ""world"" and be with the woman he has been in love with.If you are not a fan of Jim Carrey and him being the star sways you, I urge you to watch this film. It will change your life, and your opinion of Jim Carrey as an actor.10/10",The Truman Show
707,cjohn-16765,An underrated pearl,10,8 May 2017,"Just watched this film last night, and found that it is such a great file that I can't understand why I have missed it for so long.I would put it in the same tie with The Matrix (1999). The concepts in both movies are similar, and more importantly, The Truman Show came out before The Matrix did.Dunno why there was not a single Academy Award for this great movie. I just love it and couldn't stop thinking about it.Just one question about it (a little spoiler in it, but...): When Truman was sitting in the beach, why was the rain falling on himself only but not anything else? If the crew's purpose is to make Truman believe in the ""world"" he was living in, they shouldn't have made this error, should they? I mean, if I were part of the weather crew, I would downpour the beach area where Truman was sitting. From the movie, it looked to be an important prompt for Truman to realize that there was a plot around him. The crew has been controlling all this for about 30 years, and it is hardly believable that they would have made such a stupid error.By the way, I found the director character Christol is quite likable. I happened to find he was also the Marine General in The Rock (1996). The opening speech by him in front of the Marine cemetery was touching and the following mutiny his command staged was pretty impressive.",The Truman Show
708,bgdenk,What could be a reality,8,28 December 2016,"In the last scene of The Truman Show shows two security guards who watch the show their whole day at work. One of them says to the other what else is on after Truman leaves the set. For the first time in the history of the show Truman says something directly to the fans watching. The Truman Show is aimed at all audiences because it is a funny and dramatic film but only some will see the true meaning behind it. For the romantics there is a love story between Truman and Sylvia, Lauren, for the comedians Jim Carrey hilariously portrays Truman Burbank, and for the dramatics it tells the all too sad story of how a young child is taken at birth and raised by a corporation for profit. The Truman Show is a must see for everyone. Weir's take on The Truman Show was made to display the directors beliefs of what could happen if reality TV goes too far. A fictional idea that could be all to true. When someone is filmed non-stop for their whole life they ultimately are given no privacy. Weir named the director of The Truman Show on TV ,within the movie The Truman Show, Christoph because of a performance artist named Christoph who would use people and other object to create art. The Truman Show in some ways was made to show how artists might go ""too far"" in creating what they believe is art. Christoph traps Truman in what is basically a cage for his entire life. Everything Truman has been taught has been controlled by someone else. Truman has no choice in choosing what he can and cannot do. His entire life has been controlled by the outside world. Weir is trying to warn people that if actions are not taken soon people may go too far in the real world. Restrictions on what people can do without an individual's consent should only ever be needed as a fall back. Artists and creatives alike although they may want to finish their ""dream project"" should have the ability to restrict themselves from doing unethical things. Peter Weir has set a limit of what something should never be with his film The Truman Show.",The Truman Show
709,quintenschram,My favourite film of all time!,10,29 June 2020,"The Truman Show is a movie I would not claim to be the best movie ever made. However it is one of the best movies, and it is definitely the one I care most about. The reason why this movie works so well for me and why i think it is so unique is that this movie lies perfectly in the sweet spot of what i like. The movie is not too long. Not too short. Its sad, but not too sad. Its funny, but not to annoying extend. Its a clever film, with an interesting plot but not in a way you have to use 150% of your brains to keep up. The characters are unique but none is acting over the top. The music is beautiful, original and perfectly fitting. The decor and setting is very well done. Just perfectly balanced. Most of the times when I am watching a masterpiece, there is always a drawback (like for instance a film being too long, or having boring bits or being too complicated or forced at times) The Truman show has no drawbacks for me.Another thing i need to point out is the message of this film. This film is about a man who is trapped in his own reality show without knowing it. Ever since he was born he is recorded and everyone surrounding him even his parents are actors in the film. He lives in a complete lie where all of his surroundings is a construction for his television show. This means that he never left the film set for his entire life due to fears of traveling that they gave him when he was younger.This is where i think this is one of the most poetic films of all time. You have a kind man living in a created paradise where everything is perfect. If he will just stay where he is, he will always be save, with a good life, without any harm or problems. And the only thing he wants is to get out! It shows how people are not made to live in a perfectly controlled environment and that there will always be a natural desire for imperfections and freedom in a lifetime.Also Truman finds true love with a woman that start to care about him. But she wasn't one of the actors that he was supposed to be with. She is the first one to try to get him out of this place. I'd love her part because she is an active being trying to help him out even though she doesn't have the power to do so. (I think this is important because I feel a lot of classic and well received movies unfortunately tend to portray women as kind of useless beings at times). So to have her as a character that means much for his desire to escape but also her active role of getting him out i find very refreshing.So they take her away from Truman, and they make sure he will never meet her again. They make Truman mary another woman who is just an actress. Their love isn't even real. Now the beautiful part is that the other woman can still follow The Truman Show on television and see how truman still thinks about her. I think that is both sad and romantic at the same time.She also has a button on her clothes that says: ""How's it going to end?"" Both Truman and the audience is wondering the same thing throughout the movie. And that is also the main question of the film itself. How's it going to end?Another thing i love is that this movie has no clear villain. The only person you may consider a villain is the person that took most care for Truman his entire life, but also destroying him at the same time even though he doesn't want to. And that is the director in the film. You feel that everything he does, is meant to do right yet he does everything so egocentrically wrong. There are scenes in which you can feel his sadness about his own undoing. Directing The Truman show made The Truman Show also become his life as well. And he loves Truman more then anyone else. He honestly believes what he is doing is the right thing for Truman. It makes you wonder, who actually lives the lie here? I have never seen a 'bad guy' being portrayed so originally.Besides all this, Truman is played by Jim Carry. And it is in my opinion together with his part in Eternal Sunshine his best role ever played. He is not as Jim Carrey-ish as you picture him in most movies.

I really like the idea of the world revolving around me, cause at one point I had a same thought in my head.The story is pretty generic. the main character is kind-hearted, he fell into all the staged setups and eventually discovers that he's getting fooled. If the story wasn't generic, it may have gone weird, so I prefer the generic lifestyle.About the extra-role people repeating same thing. It wouldn't have took him 22 years to notice that. For 10,000 days they'll have tons of variations and dramas going on within the town. Also the advertisement wouldn't been subtle without actors vocally pointing it out.The television rating wouldn't have been high as well. Probably first year, and last year of his life. The scale of staffs involved would've been much larger. They'll be prepared for any situation and the townspeople'd be really just living in there, not even acting as a part.",The Truman Show
711,katiecaswell,The Truman Show Review,8,27 February 2018,"The Truman Show, a heartwarming film yet disturbing image of the ideal American life revolves around a man, Truman Burbank, played by Jim Carrey, who lives his life unknowingly on a giant television set where his life is and has been broadcasting live ever since he was born, 30 years ago. 
Throughout the film, the director, Peter Weir, uses many shots that have a faded black circle around it or use a fisheye lens. This is a constant reminder to the audience that Truman is secretly being watched and televised. There are many other techniques used to help reinforce this idea that Truman is trapped in a false world such as unnatural lighting where a spotlight is seen coming from the moon. Many of the characters will also look directly into the camera, which is known as ""breaking the fourth wall"". This is seen when Truman is talking and looking at the camera through his mirror making it seem as if he is trying to communicate with the audience. There are also subtle comedic references that would hint at the fact that they are in a TV show such as Truman's closest friend, Marlon, and wife, Meryl, having names that resemble famous actors. 
Jim Carrey balances comedy and drama well in the film, very different from his well-known roles played in Dumb and Dumber and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Overall, Peter Weir does a very good job at portraying how Truman's world has been manipulated and controlled throughout his whole life, forcing the audience to question their own world and the control they have on it.",The Truman Show

718,rocki,Ddisappointing execution,5,9 October 1998,"I admit, I was prejudiced against Jim Carrey when I walked into the cinema. I had never been able to watch a whole movie with him playing in it. However I had hopes knowing that Peter Weir (Witness, The Mosquito Cost, Dead Poet Society etc.) directed the film. I also heard praises about the film.Well, I watched this film all the way, and actually I had fun during the second half of it. The ideas were really promising, and  the film had some moments, but the first part soap was far too long. People do not go to a cinema to watch daytime TV. It lacked acting too. The characters were playing soap actors and there is not much fun to watching that. And Jim Carrey, who supposed to be the real person in the show was no different from them. Sorry, this guy just cannot form a character because he is a bad actor. Weir should have noticed it since he had directed actors like Harrison Ford and Robin Williams before. Carrey's performance really hurt the film. No wonder the moment Ed Harris, who did a great job realising the allmighty producer of the show, started to dominate the film it got much better. But on the whole this film belongs to the group of movies you can write a lot about because of the ideas behind them, but you don't want to see them for the second time. In film-making it is fine to have great ideas and be able to talk about them, but if when you have to go out you cannot make them really work then you missed the point.",The Truman Show

It was cleverly executed with lots of nice touches, and a surprisingly good performance from Carrey who led his character on the voyage of dawning realisation with conviction, but still managed to remain endearing and induce sympathy from the audience.Probably worth a few Oscars, but probably won't get them.",The Truman Show
721,jriisj,Jim Carrey in a new way,8,10 December 1998,"Good movie. It was nice to see Jim Carrey this way. In his earlier movies the ""only"" or most of the comedy was J.C. himself but he has definitely taken a turn for the better. In ""Liar Liar"" it was the situation that was funny, J.C. only made it more funny (I must admit that the only time I fell off the chair was after the movie where they showed the mis-takes). But in The Truman Show it really came through. The drama and comedy were perfectly balanced. The one thing that really was astonishing was that I found myself doing precisely what I thought was morally wrong. I was sitting there and following his entire life to every detail and wanted more. I almost wished that I was there in that ""movie-world"" watching the TV, following his every move. When I realized that, I really loved the movie. It sucked me in and spat me out again.

722,ballpark,"Good Movie, But Surprising",8,2 March 1999,"""The Truman Show"" was an interesting and well portrayed premise. Jim Carrey and Ed Harris were wonderful in their roles.  What's Surprising about the film is that Ed Harris captured an Academy Award Nomination for his role, but Jim Carrey didn't!  I suppose the Academy only has a limited number of Nominations.  All in all, a very good film.  Definitely, worth a good look.",The Truman Show
723,Jedi-29,The best movie in recent history!,10,26 November 1998,This Is one of the best movies ever made. I rank it right up with Star Wars and other movie greats.  Not only is the plot sublime but the acting is excellent and it very well made. Do see this movie.,The Truman Show
724,luiggi,Fresh and original.,8,4 February 1999,"It is very original though it's kinda slow. It was definitely weird to see Jim Carrey play this role, but I liked it. Well, there's not much to comment on but, my advice: it could have used a little comedy.",The Truman Show
725,ZMan-6,Amazingly original,10,20 February 1999,"Some of you who sit down to watch this movie will probably hear a great deal about the plot before you press PLAY. If you have yet to be exposed, cover your ears. The premise of this film is so unusal... you must allow for some elements of surprise. I was totally enthralled, and really had no idea what would happen next. Granted, I think most will predict ""How does this thing end"" (little white pin/button), but I would advise you not to try. Just kick back, relax and enjoy the fantasy. It's a great one.Jim Carey does his usual fair share of overacting, but it seems to work just fine here. The other players are essentially dwarfed by Carrey's performance. Ed Harris, however, does an excellent job in a supporting role. Peter Weir's direction is meticulous and highly effective.Even if you don't like this film, it will make you ponder just a bit. Those who let themselves get drawn in to bizarre storyline will simply love it.",The Truman Show
726,filmbuff-22,The best film of the year!,10,16 January 1999,"Without a doubt the best film of the year, the Truman Show's originality, beautiful set design and wonderful performances by Jim Carrey and Ed Harris set this film's standards far beyond anyone else ever imagined. Jim Carrey's performance was so heartfelt, innocent, and powerful that if the film stunk, his performance would carry it throughout the film. Ed Harris' performance as the deranged director of the Truman Show, Davidtz, is very creepy and entertaining. From beginning to end, this film is pure entertainment and emotions that will have you think about the film for months on end.",The Truman Show
727,zero-23,Out of Paradise in 4 Episodes,10,14 March 1999,"See how film-makers think of the universe? A door and a small exit-sign.That's it. Nothing more. Behind are some scene-workers smoking, no place to go for the star. Unless you don´t know you are the star. Truman (What is True?) finds out that this is not the world for him.But when he realizes? The moment Christof speaks to him like a God. For Truman he is God. Episodes 10909 - 10112 of the Truman Show are the Essence of what we like to call ""struggle for independence"". Warhol said: Everybody will get his 15 minutes of fame. Everybody seems to long for that. After Truman left the Show how long will it take until he wants to be famous again. Maybe he is Talkshown as ""The Man exploited for television"". Then medias lead theirselvses ad absurdum.10/10",The Truman Show
728,_MonaLisa_,One of the greatest movies ever,10,19 April 1999,"What can I say? I´ve seen The Truman Show now 5 times in theaters and I am still under its spell. This movie is touching,  gripping, dramatic, funny, frightening and philosophic together, and it makes you think - and not only for a couple of minutes. It´s simply magic. Thanks to P. Weir, A. Niccol, S. Rudin, D. Gassner, P. Biziou, B. Dallwitz, J. Carrey, E. Harris, the whole cast & crew, for making this highly intelligent film - thank you so much! And SHAME ON THE ACADEMY! Only 3 noms, not a single award??? I refused to watch the Oscar-ceremony. But I am glad the film received 3 awards at the Golden Globes and also at the BAFTAs - it really deserved it. Jim Carrey is simply great as naive Everyman and tortured soul Truman Burbank, who eventually desperately wants to find out if the truth is really ""out there"". Although I liked Liar Liar and The Mask, I wasn´t a Jim Carrey fan until recently. Now I am. I was fascinated by his engaging, touching performance. He found the right way between comedy and drama, as well as the rest of the crew. Set design and cinematography are both excellent, the score is one of the best I have heard for a long time - B. Dallwitz did a great job, and also did P. Glass. I know many people complained about the ending - I loved it: abrupt and nicely ambiguous. Once again you have to THINK for yourself: How´s it going to end?... Peter Weir has made a lot of great movies, but this one surely will go down in movie history. Sensational.",The Truman Show
729,SamBob,Disappointing!,6,20 April 1999,"I heard so much hype about this film and how superb it was.Four of us watched this film together and we were all of the same opinion, and that is that this film was very much over-rated.  In particular, we found the end of the film very poor and open-ended.",The Truman Show
730,rob-239,Excellent,10,27 April 1999,"I really liked The Truman Show.  It is one of my favorite movies.  I enjoyed the movie on just about every level, and I found the story line to be easy to understand and very meaningful as well.  Jim Carrey did a superb job in his character; I was pleased to see that he could perform a serious role so well.  I also loved the details in the movie, like the ways Omnicam ""manufactured ways to keep Truman on the island"".  It's an amazing plot, the way all of Truman's life was viewed by millions without him being aware. The only weak points I found involved the movie being a bit far-fetched (only in the effects, like being able to create artificial thunderstorms in a man-made dome).  I also thought that the ending could have been a bit longer. But, as a whole, it was brilliant. I was very disappointed it did not receive more Oscar nominations.",The Truman Show
731,Glenn-44,Ever wondered why you're here?,7,19 August 2000,"A truly heartening film, watching Truman as he slowly discovers that he is trapped in a TV show. However, I felt slightly let down by the fact that once he was out, that was it. No follow up as to how he fares in the real world, and if he ever met up with Sylvia. It's good, if a little on the short side.",The Truman Show
732,Marc E L,Very good acting.,6,5 August 1999,"In this movie Jim Carrey really shows that he can act, it´s a shame that he didn't get nominated. Both Carrey and Harris are perfect for this movie. But if your lookin´ for a fun comedy with Jim Carrey this isn't the movie you want.",The Truman Show
733,10 of 24,The best that I've Ever Seen!,10,12 August 1999,"I'll admit. I happen to like Jim Carrey, and that was the main reason for me renting it out. But Now that I've seen it, I think it's one of the best Movies EVER!I'm not going to talk about how good it was, or how well filmed it was. This film was an excellent chance for Jim Carrey to break out of the Typecast he put himself in, and quite frankly this was a chance he grabbed with enthusiasm.Just one gripe, however. The scene with him walking out the door. I'm aware that this is supposed to be the climax of the film, and I loved it as it is, but I felt that ""The Holy Grail"" by Hunters and Collectors would have made this scene absolutely perfect. Why? The first verse says it all.""Woke up this morning, from the strangest dreamI was in the biggest Army, the world had ever seenWe were marching as one, on the road, to the Holy Grail...""",The Truman Show
734,James-207,Something different for a change,10,2 October 1999,"At last, something a little (not completely) different from the movie whorehouse that is Hollywood today. The Truman Show is such a wonderful movie it just has to be seen to be believed. I have read many comments made about this and there are flaws, but we don't watch movies to look out for flaws. If they are obvious ones then fair enough, but this film is consistent and true to itself and paints a good enough picture of a world in which one man is put on a stage without him knowing it. But the true success of this film is how you cannot help but root for the guy (one of my personal top qualities of a successful film). You feel his pain and you just want him to get the hell outta there!!! I don't really like Christof much, he is a little one dimensional and a bit too on the evil side...a bit sick. But that aside, there is not much else at fault. I love the way we see Truman as the viewers would see him, ALL the time...because they have cameras everywhere..that is so clever. Anyway, enough about the film - i'm going to watch it again right now. Bye!",The Truman Show
735,iome,Little food for thought.,2,26 April 2000,This movie is not a reflection about the invasiveness of television: this is a movie on a man who discovers (quite quickly in fact) that his own life is a TV show and decides to escape. The movie is just the history of how he tries and succeeds to escape. A really bad movie.,The Truman Show
736,dboulter,Garbage,3,18 May 2000,"I watched this movie on TV, and was looking for something a lot better. It had received a lot of support when it was in the cinema, both from the critics and the general public. After watching it I wonder how it was given such high rating. I am not a fan of Jim Carrey, but I know that he has a lot of talent, mainly in the comedy field. I don't know which is worse this movie or The Cable Man. However I do hope that this Canadian talent is not wasted and he is given some better scripts. At many points in the movie I was just at a loss what was going on. Watching a third or fourth rerun of ""Murder She Wrote"" would  have been a better option.",The Truman Show
737,Skippy-64,Top of the line. This is a classic!!!,10,9 June 2000,"That's all I can say. It's way cool, I loved it, bought it, watched it again, watched it with others, watched it some more..... Well, nobody can be told what the truman show is, you have to see it for yourself!!!Well, what r u waiting for? Go see it!!!",The Truman Show
738,zachanders,The Creepiest Non-Horror Movie I've Ever Seen!,10,5 September 2019,"Wow. What an experience. I've never seen a film more thought-provoking as this one - nothing compares to its originality and true craftsmanship put into the production. An absolute gem of cinema.
There is so much about this film that I love. The overall idea of a man's life controlled and watched entirely by a TV corporation is intriguing as can be. I especially love how the TV set resembles a '50s nuke town, architecture wise and how the civilians (all actors) dress and speak. It's a perfect environment in which the protagonist, Truman Burbank, can gradually find small hints and clues as to what elaborate, insidious plan is taking place over his life.
More to add is the stellar cinematography it has. The shots are arranged as if we are seeing it through the hidden cameras put on the TV set, and it can be in the most peculiar of places - light-posts, trash cans, posters, magazines, even Truman's wedding ring. This aspect adds another layer to the film that is unique from most other films' standard camera framing.
The musical score fits the film in the most absolutely perfect way - that is unparalleled to anything I've witnessed before. Yes, I have since come to learn that the musical score was in fact not composed for this film, but for a 1989 foreign film - but the notion still stands. The way it is incorporated into the setting gives off an eerie mood, as it fits the film's eerie feelings.
And finally, I simply must acknowledge the absolute feat of the script and acting that is present in this movie - notably from Jim Carey. I have to admit that Jim Carey isn't really a favorite actor of mine. He's a decent comedian, but from what I've seen of his, I realize his best work is actually in his dramatic roles. The Truman Show has Carey's best acting. It's literally perfect. I honestly prefer him in more dramatic roles. The supporting characters also put up a phenomenal job with their line delivery and overall acting, also thanks to the intricate screenplay.
My favorite of the entire movie is the ending, when Truman crashes his sailboat into the edge of his world (the TV studio). As he walks up the stairs to the blended in exit door, the emotion is in full swing. The elegant music, stunny cinematography, and heart-wrenching dialogue between Truman and the creator, Christof. It's then when Christof tells Truman the truth, saying:Truman: Who are you?
Christof: I am the Creator - of a television show that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
Truman: Then who am I?
Christof: You're the star.And at that moment, to Christof's dismay, and as the TV transmission of The Truman Show ends, Truman walks into the real world, leaving one where he really was the only ""true man.""",The Truman Show
739,sparklesgirl,Wow.......It really changed my mind,10,10 September 2006,"It really changed my mind about Jim Carrey. Now I'm not a big fan of Jim, I think he is witty, stupid, and quite irresponsible. I always find that in every movie he is in he does something stupid. Not in this one though. This movie is one of my favorites of all time. Who thought up this scenario, I don't know but it was an amazing piece to watch. I must tell you I cried near the end. I usually never cry over movies unless they are sad; but it had the music too and it was really good. Jim Carrey showed me that he can be sensible in one movie and I'm sure if you ask people ""What is one of Jim's best performances?"" They'd say ""The Trueman Show"" right back at you. I remember the scenes so well even though i have only seen it twice since it was released. I guess what they say it true: A good movie stays with you forever. Now I would recommend this movie to any of you out there, I gave it a 10/10 which is quite unusual for me. But i really did love this masterpiece, so if your considering it please do.This movie finally makes you think about life. If anyone has ever seen Bruce Almighty with Jim Carrey it is the same kind of thing. Of course every movie has to have humor, which it does. Jim Carrey is excellent in this movie along with the other co-stars for it.Trueman is the most famous person in the world..but he doesn't know it.",The Truman Show
740,dincymang,Everyone is in the Truman Show,10,1 May 2020,"Clearly, Truman belongs only to Truman's world -- a manipulated virtual world. His birth, his growth, his joys, his sorrows, and, if nothing else, his death, will all be played out on a rigged and choreographed stage, watched by countless men and women in the glamorous modern world. They are an integral part of Truman, and they are growing up together. Without Truman, their lives will be unsustainable, the world will be in chaos, and life will be meaningless.From the moment we are born, to the moment we grow, to the moment we die, our understanding of the world is always limited. We have to reach beyond the confines of our bodies to enable our minds to access the long past, to envision the long future, to imagine alien worlds, to satisfy our boundless curiosity and thirst for knowledge. In this sense, we have to agree with McLuhan's wise words: ""the medium is an extension of the human body.""Truman came out, because of his dream, because he did not want to live a quiet and comfortable life, brave and make people cry. Go out is not only a Truman show, as well as the bit player hopes to pursue their dreams, they see someone do you want to do and not do.
So the people in the bar are crazy, the old woman is in tears, the bath people are crazy.But this kind of courage is impossible for ordinary people!So, said the guard, what else is on? Look at the others.
Having fulfilled their dreams, ordinary people return to their truman world and continue their quiet and peaceful lives",The Truman Show

Omg the acting, what to say about Jim Carey, he looked so effortless while doing an amazing job, most scenes looked so genuine. Combines everything I classic films must have, it leaves you wondering what would u do in the same situation.

People rate this high because they think we are supposed to. If we don't then we are not getting it's point and we are lacking.  Jim Carrey does do a good job. However, Ed Harris' character is ridiculous, He's just not believable. The main reason this movie fails is the storyline is ridiculous; it's just to far fetched. Society isn't so cruel that we would allow let alone watch a show like Truman. Celebrity Boxing and Survivor Sure. But the premise for The Truman Show is Cruel the main character is not a voluntary participant. Basically he's Innocent and being violated and we are supposed to think everyone thinks it's ok.

Although the government-is-watching-you-scare is now less than it used to be, our lives are becoming more and more public. Not in the least because of this great Internet.

I didn't know the secret when I saw the film, and was able to enjoy the little doubts and wondering that the filmmakers so carefully planted. Truman's world is controlled by a TV producer named Christof (Ed Harris), whose control room is high in the artificial dome that provides the sky and horizon of Seahaven. He discusses his programming on talk shows, and dismisses the protests of those (including Sylvia) who believe Truman is the victim of a cruel deception. Meanwhile, the whole world watches Truman's every move, and some viewers even leave the TV on all night, as he sleeps.The trajectory of the screenplay is more or less inevitable: Truman must gradually realize the truth of his environment, and try to escape from it. It's clever the way he's kept on his island by implanted traumas about travel and water. As the story unfolds, however, we're not simply expected to follow it: We're invited to think about the implications.

It was interesting to see how Truman got pushed against posters for advertisement, even his own wide did a hot cocoa add in his house. It was funny to see how far people would go just to get a product out in the public, since they know that people were always watching. In a way I don't think that it was fair that Truman had to go through his life thinking that his father died in a horrible accident, but the movie has a good ending since Truman comes to realization and finds out that his father is still alive.",The Truman Show

His quirks and humor made watching more entertaining. At time i really felt bad for him and i really got into the film and the plot. Some of the ""zoom-out's"" used were really well done.

I think since he became really successful through comedic movies like ""The Mask"" or ""Ace Ventura"" he was categorized as a comedic actor. I think if he didn't accept those roles, he would be offered more serious roles today and I think he would be successful at it. I liked all of the irony in the movie, like all the scenes that were related to the bible. This is one of the movies I really paid attention to the detail and not just the entertainment aspect of the film. I'd like to see Jim Carrey in more serious roles in the future.

It has such a simplistic feel to it, but it is loaded with satire and profound meaning. This is Jim Carrey's best performance in any of his films; by far, surpassing his performance in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Truman Burbank is the star of his own reality TV show and he doesn't even know it. He is the first star born on set and legally adopted by a TV show. We've all felt the sensation that ""this can't be happening to me, I must be getting Punked,"" But for Truman, this is his whole life. With a great cast and clever plot, Director Peter Weir weaves together a masterpiece. The movie points out the insatiable nature of TV viewers (aka US), and the extent that producers and directors will go to please their audience. Forget morals; forget people's feelings or reputations, ""we want to be entertained"". Weir compares us to the Romans. Just as the Romans craved entertainment at the expense of Gladiators, we crave entertainment at the expense and reputation of TV stars, athletes and regular people. How far is society willing to go?

763,siddhartha-khanooja,One of the best movies ever made.,10,24 May 2019,"On a whim, I decided to whip up 'The Truman Show', whose premise is new in itself - a person is the unwitting star of a reality show, starring himself as the protagonist. The whole town in which he lives in is the world's most expensive set.There's so many great elements in this film - the music (amazing), the cast (Jim Carrey deserved an Oscar nomination for this, his acting was absolutely beautiful), the themes (this film is as dystopian as 1984, if seen from the PoV of Jim Carrey), and of course, the feelings of alienation and conformity.Watching this film is an experience. In the end, you feel as if you're also part of 'The Truman Show' audience. This rollercoaster of emotions that the film takes you through is mind-numbing.I'll not be ashamed to admit that this is one of the first times I have cried on seeing the ending. Watching this piece of art is an experience in itself.TL;DR - 10/10, go watch it, however you can.",The Truman Show
764,priteshkumar-51516,Watching it felt good.,8,4 January 2017,"This may contain some spoiler. The scene where the creator of the show tries to persuade Truman for not leaving it was well written. Truman making a photograph of his lost love Sylvia out of mag zines was also quite good. Personality of Truman could have been explored in a better way. They way he starts doubting everything happening around and deducing was not rightly justified.Many faults can be ignored if this movie was made as a light humor with fantasy.The whole idea of incorporating different characters in Truman life is quite creative in same ways. Like usage of his friend Marlon to insure him that everything in his life is fine and natural.That was also a well written scene. All in all, a great movie to watch, Thanks for making it.",The Truman Show
765,higginskill,Jim Carrey's best film and needs to be watched by everyone at least once.,8,8 July 2017,The Truman show is not only a great original movie but probably Jim Carrey's best performance. The film is about An ordinary man who figures out his entire life was a lie and he was being filmed the whole time in a reality TV show with paid Actors. This film is probably one of the most original ideas and I think most people can relate to at certain times of their lives and has spawned movies that are close in idea. I would give The Truman show an 8/10 and I believe the film deserved at least one Oscar for the amount of work and creativity put on the film.,The Truman Show

Andrew Niccol's idea is a creative and viable one in today's world, and Peter Weir wonderfully directs The Truman Show using interesting camera angles.  And of course, Jim Carrey is phenomenal as Truman Burbank--comedic, dramatic, wonderful.  I hope he does more films like this.  This shows he can handle serious movies as well, yet still be light-hearted at times.  Her certainly deserved and Oscar in my opinion for his performance.

770,SJS,"Very intelligent, one of the year's best.",10,15 August 1998,"So as not to spoil the plot, I am going to choose my words carefully.  Truman Burbank is a man living in a sort of fishbowl world, as the star of ""The Truman Show"", a T.V. series that brings hope and joy to millions of people.Truman is played by Jim Carrey, brilliantly.  His acting should definitely get him an Oscar nomination.  There is one long scene in the movie where Truman doesn't say a word, but you know exactly what he's thinking.  Kudos to Peter Weir as well, for his masterful direction, and to Peter Biziou's cinematography.  Almost every shot in the film is from the point of view of a television camera, and creates a kind of documentary feel.Let's talk about suspense.  ""The Truman Show"" is more suspenseful than many ""thrillers"".  It is impossible to tell what will happen next.  This is due to Andrew Niccol's script.A sure bet for a nomination for Best Picture, ""The Truman Show"" is intelligent, witty, and contains a very sweet love story for those romantic types out there.

I have never sat inside a movie theater and been so involved with the life of Truman.  Watching the man slowly unravel the world around him that is not really there was like watching movie magic fully come alive. For once I wasn't awed by a movie's special effects or it cheap pathetic patos it tries to drivel out at us, but I was more interested in this beautifully told fable made ready for the nineties.  Peter Weir is a genius and I cannot wait for this film to make him more recognized as just that. He knows how to tell a story and all the while hold Jim Carrey under restraint.",The Truman Show

The subject matter is very topical as the media strives to create more and more realism with ""Fly on the Wall"" documentaries. I do not feel the premise of a person living in his own TV. show so extraordinary nowadays.Perhaps we should see this film as a warning about where the media may be taking us.The acting is excellent throughout and the revelations as they come certainly kept me glued to the screen throughout. I thoroughly recommend this film.",The Truman Show

Then I was explained it was a movie with Jim Carrey, which made me want to see it, and when I discovered the subject, I went to the cinema, bought my place and watched it. I was not deceived: it is an excellent film, with an good plot, and good actors. The only thing I find bad is that Jim Carrey has not been able to change completely his way of playing his rule. Indeed, Truman is too much closer to Ace Ventura when trying to make humour (the only difference being that he does not succed in making his neighbours laughing, because they do not belong to the same world).

Think about you as Truman, in a plastic world, no one really cares about you, they are paid for loving you. What an ugly, false world. Our world, listen to Christof, is better? Isn't it false as Seahaven? Can people be so cruel? Just after the end of the show, the tragedy of Truman's choice... they ask for more.

785,Paul Bluewing,"A great movie about sense of reality, fatherhood and desire",8,24 November 2000,"I think this is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen and I'll tell you why.The argument is about a guy, Truman (Jim Carrey) that lives a simple life, with no surprises. He grew, married, works every day, that's it. Just common and anonymous life like any other. But what his life definitely is not is anonymous, as the whole world watch every step he makes, every blink, every word, every snort. His whole world is a TV set built just to give scenery to his life. That means he lives in some kind of show being the only actor who does not perform. He really lives. The other ones are part of the set, a huge one. The purpose of this is to make a unique and completely naive show about a person's life, some kind of media true show / experiment. At one point, he became suspicious and tried to run beyond the scenes. Would he make it?There is not so much comedy in this picture, at least not when a take a reflective angle on it. Yeah, there are some scenes, here and there, and all throughout the movie wanders the sense of irony and ridicule. Still, the drama performs since the beginning.I always demand a good movie for show me the reality in the day by day and some perspective in a world that very often seems too shallow to worth analyze it. Reality and perspective, I've found them both here.Under the argument, original itself, there are two major ""themes"" that began to develop. The first of it, is the reality and solidness of the world we live. The other one is the fatherhood. And lingering all around, a third tune in this melody, the desire.Reality... How you define reality? Is reality what you touch, you smell, and especially what you see? Do the relations with the other human beings define reality? In Truman 's case the reality is a fake. Because he lives in a fake scenery, in a fake city, with hundreds of fake persons, all actors that perform all the time, but live not life at all (at least at the stage, of course). But the point is, doesn't does happen, in a lighter degree, in everybody's life? Because in one hand, we see what the TV and Internet shows, we trust that as THE source of information. They shape our vision of things. The media are OK for the show, the big entertainment show. However, can they be reliable to define reality? On the other hand, how honest about our feelings and thoughts are we in our normal lives? How much of what we are we show to colleagues at work, or fellow students, or friends, for that matter, or even our couples? How many times do we split appart what's happening inside and outside? Half and half, even less than that may be? So, if we define reality through our senses and relations, and those are not fully trustable, how can we know in what world are we living in? And that question remains all over the film.What made Truman discover the truth, that is that he was being cheated? Well, he started to watch carefully around, and began to question and test. At some point, he started to do so not because he was mistrustful, curious or just stupid. He started to search because he couldn't believe he would not be able to live his dream, to accomplish his wishes. Which were not other than to meet a girl his girl (Sylvia). Oh, yeah, Truman has his sweetheart. Took away from his life for the major of all sins, trying to tell him the truth. So his desire led him to the discovery of the truth, and so this is also a movie about desire. It's his desired what set him free at the end.Fatherhood... Why do I see that as a major theme in the movie? Well, Truman is an orphan, adopted by the company the director of the show rules. So he does have a father, and that is Cristof. He is legally and morally his father. But what a father! He can do with Truman everything many fathers dream to be able to do with their kids. He can supervise him every time he wants with countless video cameras. He designs his environment. He decides who he relates with, even who exist in his life, and manipulate Truman as deep as he wants to obtain the exact results in people interaction. He can take away the characters he don't like (Sylvia, his ""dead"" father). He can even order night and day in his son's world (literally). And all this, without paying any price at all. I mean, a father should suffer the reactions, critics and oppositions of his sons, but not in Cristof 's case. He doesn't have to suffer that because Truman doesn't know his life is being ruled, arranged. Oh, what a relief make all he wants with his son's life without suffering all the nuisances and the complains. Without any exposition at all.And at the end, what a furious father had Truman to face at. When the knowledge came, the rebellion followed. How could he dare? To rebel at him, the master, supreme power that make all decisions in his life. If he don't yield, Truman should be punished, with no remorse at all. Even killed, if necessary. And Cristof had the power to kill him indeed. This father is not just a father, he is a god. And who will prevail in the relation between this man and his personal god-father (!)? Is he just a puppet or a free man?Truman reminded us, no matter how it cost, freedom worth's it. His desire took him from his golden cage to a dangerous, unpredictable, tough world, but still a place within to be free. It's worth the price, no doubt at all.",The Truman Show
786,Tonsku,Work of a genius,10,14 July 1999,"Most annoying was the feeling of clearly being part of multi-layer story myself. The folks in Christof's world were watching Truman watch tv while I was watching them, and Truman and the show he was watching. Suddenly I realized that I was, in fact, also being part of the chain, being in story and even a bit confused, where the Tru(e)man really lies.

787,Archie84,Best Film of the Decade!!!!,10,10 November 1999,The Truman Show is the years best movie and the best film of the decade. That says alot for being in the same decade as Schindler's List and Boogie Nights. The Mass popularity of the show is a metaphor  for our narcotic obsession with television.Trumans revolt against technology is a great fable a mythic ode to individuality that uses the oppressors own weapons against them.,The Truman Show
788,Suellen-2,Possibly Jim Carrey's best film yet.,9,23 October 1999,"I have been a fan of Jim Carrey's for a while now, since seeing The Mask. I have also seen some of his other films, such as Ace Ventura, Pet Detective and When Nature Calls, Dumb and Dumber and Once Bitten. In The Truman Show, as in Liar Liar, he shows a different style of acting which is extremely good - he shows that he can actually be serious!! I think this was a very challenging role for him, because he has done so many comedy roles in the past. He should maybe make more movies like this one, although comedy is really his scene, but The Truman Show is a real winner for me. The story line is fantastic and the acting was really well done. I give it 9 out of 10.",The Truman Show
789,wez2001,This Movie Made Me Angry!,2,20 March 2000,"I liked the premise of the film: A boy is raised from infancy in a controlled environment for the benefit of, NOT SCIENCE, but for the benefit of a rapt television audience. The possibilities were there for tremendous tension and confrontation. However, what we got was a feel-good, cop-out ending of such massive proportion that I literally felt like shaking the filmmakers and saying, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?SPOILERS AHEAD
The main reason for my wrath was the ending. If you have not seen the film, you are duly warned to stop reading here.We are supposed to cheer for Truman along with the television audience as he finds the doorway to freedom. I felt that to be a MAJOR cop-out. Truman needed to confront the people who turned his entire life into a lie. I wanted to see him confront his ""so-called"" best friend who lied to Truman POINT-BLANK. Where was the payback? Where was the justice? Where was the ethical outrage? We get humorous scenes of ""Free Truman"" factions attempting to alert Truman to his plight, but does Truman ever make anyone feel bad for what they did to him? Christof certainly felt justified in his approach, as did all of the paid actors AND the TV audience. But, if I was Truman, I'd use the opportunity to teach Christof, the actors, AND the TV audience a lesson about how to treat people. But it was an opportunity squandered.In my opinion, there were only 2 good characters in the film: Truman, and the woman he loved. Other than that, EVERY OTHER CHARACTER lies to Truman. EVERY OTHER CHARACTER deceives Truman. There needed to be some satisfactory confrontation, but there wasn't. It was the most empty feeling I've ever had watching a movie. I only rated it on film quality and not script content because the film is actually very artfully executed.But my point is this: Escape (in this case, Truman's) sometimes isn't enough. You sometimes must teach those who wronged you a lesson. You must show them the error in their ways, and those responsible should pay dearly for their moral and ethical transgressions. This movie THOROUGHLY disappointed me.",The Truman Show
790,tom.glorieux18,Original and intellectual,9,30 May 2000,"Maybe the biggest mistake of the makers of The Truman Show was bringing the film in the theatres almost at the same time Ed Tv was playing or was going to play. This is no Ed Tv, but I think many people actually think that. The Truman Show is more interesting and especially genius in style. Maybe the best part of the film is that the viewer actually feels with the character. Also it's one of the most original movies I have seen in years. The way the story unfolds is wonderful to see. I will not tell you how the story goes because then I will say things that uncover already basic elements of the movie. You just have to see it for yourself. Jim Carrey is amazing to watch and Ed Harris is his usually self, that means brilliant without stealing the show. That part is for Carrey and he doesn't use his gags or funny faces to amuse us.

797,Abhigyan_Datta,One of the best in the history of films,10,31 May 2020,"The concept explored in this film is completely unknown and unthinkable to most people. As a result it becomes paranoia inducing. The uniqueness in the story hits us so hard that we start questioning the reality around us.
A man whose whole life is a reality show, all he does is shown live to the rest of the world. He has been trapped inside a set which is made to look like a city. Everyone except Truman is an actor who plays a part in his life and makes the show interesting. Truman is seen to have a perfectly normal life with his friends and his wife. Not even for a moment does he realise that his whole life has been a setup, a reality show. It is the arrival of Lauren Garland who tries to bring the reality in front of him. She couldn't put up with the fact that a man's whole life was nothing a hoax, a show to entertain people. She condemned the usage of human lives as lab rats. Eventually Truman realises the reality and goes all-out in breaking the barrier of the set and escape from this show.
It hits us with the paranoia of happening the same with us. The audience starts questioning their reality , whether they are in a reality show as well.
In my opinion, it also brings up a surprising fact.
""We accept the reality with which we are presented"".
The fact that Truman saw the same people everyday and they all did the same thing over and over again didn't bother him ever. That is true for all of us. We all are so habituated to our daily lives, which contains performing the same routine over and over again. This film shows us that our lives can be a reality show and it still wouldn't bother us as our perception of living a ""normal"" life has so narrow prospects.
Jim Carrey delivered a marvellous performance in the film, as always. His signature laughs along with the insane ability to express emotions shone throughout the film.
The film deserved all the awards it bagged, if not more. To me it is a creative and unique masterpiece forcing us to question our reality.

I also feel like the reaction of Truman is a bit illogical. but that could just be him living in a fake world. The whole film is really bizarre.Maybe it's because the way people make movies had change. I think I'd rather the story to be told in different style.The actors are very great!

Of course it's emotional seeing Truman finally about to claim his freedom, but what really made me happy in the end was the music. It's just an incredibly written piece of music to go with an incredibly written plot.

803,NParisi4256,One of the Best Films of the '90s,10,17 March 2003,"Screenwriter Andrew Niccol followed up his inspired but slightly uneven debut (Gattaca) with this brilliant, Peter Weir directed film.  Those looking for Dumb and Dumber should look elsewhere.  I can still remember the inappropriate laughter from those in the theatre during a very profound scene in which Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) actually touches the limits of his known world for the first time.  Those who were looking for Ace Ventura were just dying to laugh at something - those who weren't saw the scene for the philosophical statement it really was.This is an intelligent, innovative take on what is actually a fairly standard SF convention - the idea of an enclosed universe, combined with the discovery by an inhabitant of that universe that ""reality"" is not what it seems.Many thought Jim Carrey got snubbed for a best actor nomination (most prominently Carrey himself), but the real injustice here was that the film was not even nominated for best picture.  Niccol was nominated for best screenplay, and deserved to win as well.This is speculative fiction of a kind that Hollywood rarely produces.

804,flaviu,The most unprecedented movie I've ever seen,9,9 February 2002,"I could thoroughly comment upon this film, as I liked it very much. Being one of my favourites', of course I would praise it. Instead, I only have one cue, for I don't want to bore anyone: Life itself is neither better nor worse than in the film; it is only a race against time, a fight with the unknown. Not a trully ""American"" classic at all, in reality an unusual prospect of life. More or less, we're all puppets on a stage and dont know who or what is pulling the strings!A very misunderstood, underated movie!",The Truman Show

I saw it again on Sky and really enjoyed the experience this time, maybe because I was alone and had more time to think, or maybe because I was a little older...I don't know.I'm not a huge fan of Jim Carey but I have to admit, his acting in this film was outstanding and Ed Harris was perfect, at the end I was starting to crack, I believed he thought of Truman as a son.In all a great film, but you need to fully engrose yourself in it to get the most out of it.My rating 9/10",The Truman Show
807,senditere,Slippery Hollow,1,24 October 2009,"Yet again this film illustrates that the Hollywood machine should on no account attempt films which speak to you at some deeper level. Stick to making thrillers, Sci-fi, romance, mainstream comedy etc which they excel at, but leave subjects like this to the European cinema or at least to the East Coast tradition. Failing that, only a director of the stature of David Lynch has the breadth of imagination to tackle a story line such as this.Quite simply the problem is that the film cannot make up it's mind whether it's a moral fable or (by a huge stretch of the imagination) a representation of some form of reality. As a result, it continuously flips between these two genres and cannot quite make up it's mind which path to take or which one to stick to.As a representation of reality, quite apart from the corn like the director wearing a beret (gimme a break), the wife trying to do product advertisement in the middle of a flaming row (!!!!!!) it's just too full of illogicalities and inconsistencies to bear even a remote resemblance to any real life situation. One might just about accept that were the whole populace of the 'set' also in the same boat as Truman himself, the scenario might ... just might ... work, but a solitary figure in a landscape of actors and extras???? Anyone with any experience of working in entertainment media sector could tell you that's simply not feasible. And the 'fable' angle doesn't work either because direction and production strive too hard to show film pertains to a real life situation.But the most glaring hole in the whole storyline is why go to such lengths (and expense) to examine human reaction in a supposedly 'Real-Life' situation. Just stick enough CCTV's in any small township or village, pay the inhabitants some dosh and tell them to get on with their life. As has been proved time and again, subjects fairly soon tend to forget that they're the subjects of a study and begin to ignore the cameras.",The Truman Show

Its so hard to find a place to begin.Firstly Peter Weir is now one of my favourite directors ,None of this movie was half hacked it was perfect from ground up.every actor was seamless as well as all being very talented.Also Jim carry has gone from mediocre actor/strange comedian to a true star of comedy.While it isn't a full blown crude laugh out load comedy or a hard hitting drama etc it still draws you in and keeps you watching.This film really does leave you sat in your chair staring blankly at the screen before saying to yourself ..............WHAT IF?",The Truman Show

The movie wont make you cry because like I sad the only sadness in this movie is in the story.They made the movie in 1998 but I watched it a couple months ago.I'm telling you if you didn't see this movie then what are you waiting for?",The Truman Show
812,b-nax,It goes so deep...,10,7 April 2013,"This movie since my whole childhood touched me the most of all movies I have ever seen and it is still the case. This is the consequence of the combination the absolutely true and brilliant emotionally composed acting of Jim Carrey, the story (simple but still intense) which he perfectly fits in and the soundtrack with well selected authentic pieces, especially those by Philip Glass, that gives so many scenes an unforgettable character. In it's emotions, the pain, the helplessness covered in clownish behavior Jim Carrey's performance reminds me very much of John Lennon's music from the early 60s. A person who never stops feeling far too small and awkward for the big role he realizes to play. But he plays it. And people look up to him.",The Truman Show

What did he do to those people who put him into that imaginary world. where is his parents? what will happened to him and the woman he truly loved? what would he feel in the outside world? what would he feel to those people who just watched him? vice versa and what would he do to the man who played God.I wish there could be a sequel. definitely gonna watch it.",The Truman Show

At the same time, it has been a very good criticism for the ever-increasing human life, especially the commodification of private life and human relations. The film has taken up the growing television madness during the filming period and has drawn attention to a possible danger, and when it says that it will be so in the future in the future, the television madness is suddenly replaced by computer internet and social media madness. While the film really makes people think about this kind of things, it also feels the happiness that being free to live on their own (again free and according to what is free and how it is discussed), but the play of Jim Carrey, who can directly convey these happiness and feelings to us, Even the seeing of Jim Carrey's face in the Wild Animal Detective Jim Carrey is causing people to grin or I said to myself that most movie stars are actually a bit of a Truman movie.",The Truman Show

And before he could go on I stopped him and said I want to watch this one. I thought it'd be hilarious like any other Jim Carrey movie. But boy was I in for a ride.The movie started out.. well somewhat confusing. Some people started talking about ""The Truman Show"". I stopped worrying what that meant and I guessed the plot within the first hour of the movie. Fantastic idea for a movie.Jim Carrey did a brilliant job. One of his best semi-serious movies.

818,avfcaira,Disturbing and wonderful,10,15 May 2005,"I've seen many movies - and of course - many Hollywood movies. Although of other descent - I usually favour European film - yet - more and more - and so often in the past - the US makes the most wonderful and deeply moving films - yet does not recognise its own art for its worth. Especially in terms of awards. But - they - the awards, are just objects - the celluloid evidence lives on and time proves the 'real' worth of films. Well - lets move beyond that issue. This is a disturbing and wonderful film. So well directed, so insightful, so moving. I am so sure this will stand the test of time. Have you ever thought - in a Shakesperean/Hamlet/clichéd sense that 'all of life is but a stage'? Have you ever thought of a 'Play within a play'?. Of course. We all question our existence - our god, our creator, our boundaries, limits, loves, the things we think we remember? This film addresses all those issues in a fun, deep, and very sensitive way. Moreover - in this age of 'reality TV' this film takes us to what surely must be the natural conclusion of this trend. The absolute and utter abandonment of the viewer to an existence of vicariously living through the 'idiots lantern' in the corner of the room. Any film that makes us think, that poses more questions than it answers is wonderful. Any film of that kind sensitively directed, wonderfully shot and with incredible casting, script and acting - is more than wonderful. Thanks Mr Wier et al for a masterful creation - I would recommend anyone to watch this - it works on many levels and will appeal to many people from all vestiges of society. Watch out for the boundaries in your life...watch and you'll see what I'm talking about.. AC",The Truman Show
819,stephieca,Fantastic,9,15 December 2005,"The Truman Show is truly a movie we need in today's world of massive media coverage. Who hasn't felt like poor Truman, feeling like the whole world was watching our every move? Imagine finding out that was actually true! I have a hard time not getting teary during the scene where Truman talks to his best friend and his best friend, in the same sentence, proclaims that Truman is like a brother to him and then tells him the lie to top all lies... all while swearing Truman can trust him! In the scene, Truman has tears in his eyes as he is really listening, but yet you can tell he has doubts to his friend's honesty...at least that is what I feel. At that moment, everyone can relate to Truman. He feels that there is no one in his world he can trust, and hearing his best friend lie finally verified that for him. The risk he takes in the end is truly a quest for real love and real friendships, and in this action there is somewhat a lesson to the viewer. Ed Harris and Jim Carrey are terrifically cast, even if they don't interact until the last few minutes of the movie. Sometimes the creator must let his creation go :)",The Truman Show

It has an awesome twist at the end and a unique plot. Its a film that no one has thought of and different from any other film. Its originality and cute humor in the film makes you smile and think at the same time. I enjoyed this film and Jim Carrey is the perfect actor to play Truman. It really makes you think!The Truman Show is rated 8 in my mind because it was mind filling and humors. It makes you wonder if maybe your life is just one big television show.

But, you cannot deny that The Truman Show is one of the better movies of the 1990s.A giant studio made to mimic a town is built for just one man and just one show. A weirdo that has some dream of some controlling every aspect of one man's life. A weird nerd that is loved by all, played of course by Jim Carrey. This film has EVERYTHING! What more could you ask for? Sure, some of the things that Christof says can get annoying, and Carrey isn't doing a super-serious roll But who cares!? It's just fun.What isn't fun is the weird feeling you get watching this movie. You know, that ""The Matrix"" feel. As you watch, you start to wonder ""Could this happen to me? Is this happening to me? How would I know?"" It really adds some flare to the story.",The Truman Show

Even though I am no fan of Jim Carrey, I thought he played Truman Burbank perfectly. Going in to the movie I was aware of the premise that Truman was oblivious to the fact that his life was a TV show. However, I didn't know that everybody in his town was actually an actor. I thought Sea haven was just a normal town (not a set). Once I become accustomed what was actually going on, I started to relish every second of this great movie. There is nothing wrong with this movie. It has humor, drama, and a fresh script; everything you would want in a movie",The Truman Show

He will soon realize that this is all part of a fiction in which he is, inadvertently, the main character. An original film in which Peter Weir forces the spectators to face up their eagerness to watch. With saturated colors and fiction acting, the movie is shot in a television style which reinforces well the sensation of watching a live drama . There are moments in which the narration develops too fast and leaves some question marks (what happens to Truman marriage?). But the film has aged perfectly well in more than 20 years and it is still posing several uneasy questions about our relationships with the media which are still more than valid in the era of social networks.",The Truman Show

The one thing that I loved about him was his abilities to make others laugh with ease and how much he enjoys what he does. Now that being said i went into this film expecting to laugh the entire time. Half way through I realized that was not going to happen, and I was OK with that. The way that this film puts a focus on love as well as the concept of being trapped in you own world is amazing.

We often live our lives without giving a second thought to the simplicity and meaninglessness of life itself. Our limited perspectives keep us from seeing. The lies we are told keep us from the truth.

And no matter how great or bad what you have been through, it is just about your own perspective.

The Truman show is funny, yes, but the jokes are not the whole film. This movie dives head first into the mind of a person who just wants to be free of his life and yes there is a twist, he's in a TV show, but even if we are not in a TV show like that, we still want to be free and this movie really makes us think about our freedom. There was no problems with this movie, it is a underrated masterpiece that everyone should watch. I cannot believe that this movie was not given a best picture nomination at the Oscars. But the true crime of the Oscars is not giving Jim Carrey the love he deserves as an actor. This should have been his Oscar. Jim Carrey gives us a complex character with layers of depth to him but at the same time, he makes a character that we can all relate to, a man who just wants to be free.",The Truman Show

Directed by Peter Weir and with Jim Carrey cast as Truman, this is a surprisingly deep and thought-provoking film for having the leading role be a comedian. The concept is that this man, Truman, who is a hardworking family man, is, completely unbeknownst to him, the star of a widely televised, live series all about his life. He slowly learns throughout the movie that his entire life, quite literally from birth, has been a setup, and that the creators of the tv show were always watching him with cameras everywhere, controlling and influencing his every move. Even his wife and best friend play along with the script of the show... what horrible loyalty! By the end, though, Truman realizes his entrapment and ends the show by leaving the bubble/set made for him as his world by the television directors, and it ends up being the grand finale to the show, as well as his personal escape.
This film could be paralleled to some of the ""conspiracy theories"" of today. Many people think that the government is constantly surveying its citizens, and this idea was made famous by the term, ""Big Brother"". Many people, including scientists, agree that what we know may not be all there truly is to Reality, as there is still so much left to discover in the vastness of the Universe. Like Truman, we may be only seeing the tip of the iceberg, only seeing what those with more control and power want us to see at this point and time. Maybe, like Truman, our true reality will be discovered by us eventually, before our ""creators"", essentially being the government, realize that we are aware of the set/ matrix and how to break free from it. In the movie, the television show film crew and directors utilized citizens in all areas of employment to attempt to stay one step ahead of Truman finding out the true nature of his reality. His entire life was orchestrated from birth, his parents essentially allowing him to be this project of sorts, for all the world to watch, until he figured out that he was the rat in the experiment, and put an end to the show. There are moral concepts that come into play, both with this film and how we can parallel it to our own possible reality. For one, the idea of using someone as a guinea pig, basically, and manipulating their whole existence and everyday happenings so that events unfold as the director of the show wishes, is crossing the moral boundaries of that person's very right to privacy...The Truman Show aired twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. The second major moral dilemma, in my opinion, that ties in with this is that the directors are using this man to earn their own incomes with this television show, so of course they want the show to be ""successful""... so to achieve their means, and to have the script play out how they need it to for the best viewer response, in their view, they went as far as to ""kill off"" Truman's father with an artificially-generated storm, forcing the boy to grow up thinking that he had lost his father, when in fact, the directors had faked the entire thing... to the entertainment and profit of the viewers and tv directors, but to the detriment of this human being, this boy who experienced this real human loss. They are essentially manipulating his entire world, until he becomes aware of this, and chooses to leave the set, ending the show, and freeing himself. 
How interesting it is to think, what if, this kind of thing could really happen to citizens by the government? What if the parallel to this movie could be a reality?

From the first reel to the last, it intrigues us, pulls us in, makes us cry, and truly makes us question the world around us. The metaphoric meaning of Truman Fairbanks is phenomenal, as are all of the performances in it. Although it was mainly recognized for Jim Carrey's first dramatic venture, the movie itself is so much more, and he perfectly fits into his role in what is truly an ensemble piece. Carrey has an amazing ability to relate to his audience, especially for one who's comic movies are incredibly over the top. He reminds of a young Jimmy Stuart in how amazingly likable he always is. Not surprisingly, Stuart is one of Jim Carrey's idols.A final testament to this movie's greatness is the stir it created at the Oscars. After Jim Carrey had won the Golden Globe for best actor, he was not even nominated for the Oscar. Similarly, a movie many critics thought was the finest of the year was not even nominated for Best Picture.

Also, when you're the audience of that television show and you're going to review it, on the audience perspective, the television show seems realistic because the scenery, the place, the sky and everything that you see in that show looks real. This is a must watch movie. The efforts of the cast and staff is worth it because you can see that the movie is successful.",The Truman Show

Unfortunately, he doesn't know that he's the most famous person in the world and he's life is a television show being played live for 24 hours without interruptions like commercial and such. He's actually living a life full of lies. He doesn't even got the chance to live as the person he really is. This movie is amazing and breathtaking because of the scenes. This will make you realize that not everything you see is real. This also shows how technology and media affects a persons' life. On the audience perspective who's been watching Truman for decades, the Truman show seems realistic because of the scenery, the place, sky and the settings. The ending left us all hanging because we doesn't have an idea what happened when Truman already left the studio and got to see the real world and Lauren, the love of his life.

Though his comedic performance was the most entertaining aspect of the 2hours I wasted on this movie, it did not make the grade. This was nothing but a thinly veiled concept movie with a big name actor to railroad it into ""the hearts of Americans"". If you want to see a movie which has depth, in which all the elements of cinematic excellence come together to form a cohesive film try something like: Brazil or reading 1984 ( that was a bad movie). Try to find a movie without the ""feel good"" American perspective, where the director is afraid to alienate the ignorant..",The Truman Show

A few years back this would have been truly imaginative but we live in the age of Jennicam. When I saw that the film was coming out my reaction was sort of ""ah, yes, I wondered when this film would show up"". When do we get a big-budget cloning nightmare film in the wake of Dolly the Sheep? (Maybe we have and I missed it. I'm not counting Multiplicity).My friend who arrived late for the film didn't know the premise and spent most of the film trying to work out why Truman's life was so peculiar, which he says made it very entertaining. Since I knew what the film was about, and it unfolded before me exactly as I expected, I found it somewhat less inspiring. I'm not saying it's bad, Jim Carrey's performance is very good, but please, a bit of perspective!6.5/10",The Truman Show
848,sitemkr,Truman is a real person. Truman needs a better show or to become a patron at the tavern.,10,6 August 1998,"What a great life Truman has! Do you wonder how many times Truman has almost drowned? Always differently, of course, according to the script for that episode. I'm not a movie critic obviously. I don't like to ""review"" movies. I like to talk about movies, without injecting a great deal of scholarship into the discussion. I have lots of education; an MBA and everything. But, some of these plots in new films are quite interesting. Who hasn't had experiences time that mirror some of these plots? I myself, have tried my hand at various occupations, like Truman's. I have been an insurance agent, and a real estate agent. All of us who have worked at these things know that fellow that gives Truman the seasickness. All of us no longer able to even ""eek"" any more. But there's is prosperity everywhere! The people are happy! The media is not complaining about anything! They're all too busy with the presidential scandals I guess. I wonder where Sylvia will take Truman. May she is going to take him to school, where they'll be happier in some sort bohemian limbo, not noticing their squalor. Truman is a bit old for it. I  don't think he'll be happy. I like Hollywood movies better than ever sometimes. But one has to wonder if the public understands them. I guess the public has no choice but to accept and tolerate. I wonder how many Trumans there are. How could Truman become a member of the tavern? Maybe all he needs to do is pick up a mild alcoholism habit. Well, at least is nice to know that the people at the tavern speak up for Truman. Poor Truman! Do you think Mr. Birbank Sr. was also an actor? Before he became a hobo, that is. Did he join the people at the tavern or not? Well if you haven't seen The Truman Show, you are missing out on a much better movie than Titanic.",The Truman Show
849,J.Benny,"Great, pure, touching and wonderful.",10,20 September 1998,"Good morning! First of all I'd like to say that I am one of the many people that loved The Truman Show. I saw many comments on that movie and some people find it too complicated or hard to understand. Everyone has a different opinion. Some people like it, some people don't. I even saw people talking about the fact that it's impossible that an human being stay alive more than 30 years without getting any light from the sun, and it's alright like that.I am personally a Jim Carrey fan and I think that most of the other fans of Mr. Carrey were ready for the transition he made in The Truman Show. Of course if you go to the theater with the idea to see a Jim Carrey movie like Ace Ventura or Liar Liar, you will maybe be disappointed. But if you know that the movie is first of all a drama, you will get out of the theater wonderfully transformed. It's like for The Cable Guy, some people went to the theater thinking they would see something like Dumb and Dumber and were disappointed. The Cable Guy was a dark comedy. The Truman Show is a drama. If you know that before seeing the movie you will not be disappointed.I said that The Truman Show transforms and it really does. Maybe not everyone will get into the story, but for those who will like I did, you'll search cameras in your bedroom (and I'm not kidding when I say that). I got the first ticket for The Truman Show at the theater of my city and I saw The Truman Show 3 times in the first 5 days it was at the theater. At all I saw it 7 times at the theater. I think that Peter Weir did a great, pure, touching and wonderful movie. The soundtrack is also wonderful and one of the posters of the movie (the one with the hundreds of pictures from the movie) is quite fascinating. I think that Liar Liar is the most funny movie of Jim Carrey but that The Truman Show is his most intelligent and touching movie. What can I say more? The Truman Show is an excellent and touching movie and a wonderful entertainment. Oh, and in case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening and goodnight!",The Truman Show

We all know, that Jim Carrey has played (before this film) just a bunch of brainless dicks. e.t.c Ace Ventura (which was funny though), but this movie shows that he can act.

852,zog-2,Could this happen,8,18 October 1998,"While watching this film, the whole time I was thinking could this happen. The premise of this movie is a man in a goldfish bowl.  Television programmes have been fly-on-the-wall, but this tells the story of a prisoner not knowing he lives a fantasy.  Curiosity kills and thus it kills the world that Truman lives in, asking the question why can't we just accept things the way they are, when we question it things go wrong.  I loved this movie, it has the tightness within the conventions of the film that makes films like Die Hard so good, the camera hardly ever moves out of the confines of the ""studio"" that is Burbanks world.  From watching this we should question the morality of television, does it have the right to invade our lives, or has it become second nature to our lives and we should simply accept it as the normality of the way we live today.  The only real problem I have with this film is it ends too quickly, I would have enjoyed an extra 30-40 minutes at the end to conclude the film satisfactorily.",The Truman Show

It satisfies any reason you have as to why do you watch a movie...for enjoyment, entertainment, to make you think, to draw a moral lesson. Yes, some of the inspiring thoughts of the movie were : ""You have to conquer your fears."" and ""Never give up.""Jim Carrey gave justice in his portrayal of the lead character. Actually, I haven't seen any write up about this but personally, I think Truman was a variation of ""true human"", the image Christof wants Truman to be. And his last name was taken from the city in California that is near Hollywood.Anyway, the concept is unique. But, the thought of Truman was being watched by millions of viewers and the crew in Christof's world, we as the movie viewers watch Truman also. Just like Truman's audience, I, myself, became attached to his character as I shed a tear in the movie's ending. I became involved in the storyline that when I went out of the movie house, I feel like I was being watched myself.But then, after the show, I went out to ""find more other things to watch.""",The Truman Show

860,ryan-51,As the years go on this film will be laughed at!!,1,13 March 1999,"Let me go on a point by point basis, in discussing this piece of dreck, this film sickened me to the point that I have to write a review for posterity so that they will know how bad it really is. Peter Weir=Dead Poet Society his only good film the rest forgettable Jim Carey=first saw him in Once Bitten - he played the character straight, he can act, it's just that this performance is not worthy of any award. Ed Harris= I defy any of you to name one film in which this man has played anyone other than himself. He plays a character that would only be believable if this were a farce, his character is so unnaturally evil, am I suppose to believe in this film that his character is so obsessed that he is crushed when a fellow human being wants to be free. And what is with the hand gestures, I want everyone to pay attention to his hand gestures, almost homoerotic in a way, if this were done on purpose it might be funny might be fitting, it's that method acting isn't it? The woman who plays his love interest=one word-TERRIBLE her face is shot in such an annoying way it is almost unbearable to watch. PLOT: if you are going to do social satire with a moral dilemma it must be believable(i.e. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (FILM and NOVEL) 1984 (NOVEL) and NETWORK (FILM)) you cannot do a STAR WARS treatment to a supposedly serious film. For example, we are supposed to believe that a man in his early thirties has been on film for his entire life: 1. if he were born sometime in the sixties the technology simply would not be available to carry on with this charade. 2. and most importantly as bad as we are as human beings I cannot believe that any of you would allow this to happen to a person, therefore what is the point of this film? It doesn't make me think of anything other than Hollywood made a great deal of money off of us and we are starting to appreciate the sh** that they give us. So now that Stanley Kubrick has died where are we? The only thing that I can think of is that I am going to have to start making movies, I can't be any worse than these guys!!!",The Truman Show

I was mainly looking to see if I could recognize any of the scenery, but was reminded at how good this movie really is.Jim Carrey's performance in this movie was really terrific, and although there were a few scenes that featured his trademark silly face routine, many other scenes demonstrated what a fine actor he really is. One scene in particular that stands out in my mind is towards the end, when he begins to realize the true scope of his situation - the editing of the scene hides his face throughout, and the viewer can still feel his pain.Truly a great film that rightly deserves to be in the IMDB Top 250, and it's sad that Carrey didn't at least get an Oscar nomination for his work.",The Truman Show

By the time the storyline became evident, I was falling asleep and then had trouble keeping my eyes open for the remainder of the movie.  I was told that the end of the movie was the best part. However, if you cannot get through the beginning, the movie is just not worth watching.  Jim Carrey's role was a good one, but it would have been a better character if they had casted a more talented actor.

Maybe there was too much humor  in Truman Show, it was too unreal or simply this style is better for  TV-series, but while I watched the movie Truman entertained me and only the idea behind the movie made me think.

I was used to seeing Jim Carrey in crazy, psycho mode in such films as ""Ace Ventura"" and ""Liar Liar"". But when I saw this film my breath was taken away. Seeing Jim Carrey in a truly great role that will live forever in the minds of people everywhere.As Truman Burbank, Carrey is an insurance salesman who has no idea that his life is being broadcast 24 hours a day onto live television from a series of intricately placed cameras by a bizarre man named Christof (Ed Harris). There isn't much star power other than these two but people such as Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, and Natascha McElhone give great performances.After a strange chain of events including a light falling from the sky, being pushed against advertisements, and the reappearance of his dead father, Truman starts to think something is awry.When the Oscar nominations were announced on February 9, I was very surprised that ""The Truman Show"" could only get away with 3 nominations. Sure they were good nominations, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Original Screenplay, but I think that Jim Carrey was robbed. As he indicated with his win at the Golden Globes he indicated the Oscar would be pretty good as he did at the Oscars too that an Oscar would be great. Best Picture and Best Original Dramatic Score which it deserves slipped from their grasp.I think that this film didn't get the success it deserved.

A must see for people who want to see a movie that is truly original.",The Truman Show
874,Dryope,What a shame,1,19 September 1999,"The Truman Show could have been so good.  There were good intentions behind it and clearly some people with huge ability working on it.  The problem was that though it pretended it was treating the audience as an intelligent entity it took the typical Hollywood attitude of presuming that after all that we would not think about this film.The subject matter demands that as we leave the cinema we must think about the questions that have been asked of us.  To what extent is the media dominating or commanding our lives, do we live to see other's manipulated, is what around us real or a projection of our imaginations (however sick and warped that may be).  All very well, in fact excellent.  Too few films ask us to question the world around us.  But this is where we run into problems. You see, once you start thinking about the film you realise quite how many holes there are in the plot.Forgive me but I would presume that if a man is brought up in a fake world he would never know it was fake because it wasn't fake to him.  For Truman Burbank there can be no real world because in reality to him everything outside the TV studio which is his reality is fake.  Forgive me if I'm not explaining myself clearly enough.  Let me put it like this.  If all your life the rain simply followed you about and did not touch others would you question it.  The answer is no because that is the way things are for you.For Truman to one day start thinking this is a bit weird is not only unlikely and out of character, it could never happen.  Similarly he would not only not find it odd that people around were constantly advertising products, he would adopt that speech pattern himself.  Ultimately this would lead to the failure of the show itself because Truman would no longer be a real man to the viewers, instead he would be more like a trained monkey performing tricks.  But this is straying from the point (though it does demonstrate how examination of the film proves how badly thought through it is).Now onto a second complaint, why is it that the people around Truman have no feelings for him?  They have grown up with him, gone through life with him. Yes, I accept he is their life line but I find it hard to believe that a man who has played his best friend for the best part of 30 years cannot care for him in the slightest.  Not even his 'parents' seem to have any real interest in his wellbeing, despite the fact that they have brought him up as if he were their own.  Are the makers of this film so cynical that they cannot give even the smallest amount of humanity to these characters?I have several other problems with the film, particularly the ending which was one of the most utterly contrived moments on film I have ever seen, as well as the lack of scope given to the show's creator, Christof (easily the best thing in it) and the unnecessary 'love interest.'  However, the major flaw of this film was the idea behind it.  It was so good that I don't think anyone really stopped to think out the complexities before making it.It is such a shame because what could have been so good turned out to be so bad.",The Truman Show
875,kingoham5,A True American Classic,10,15 December 1999,"When I first saw 'The Truman Show' I came out of the theatre amazed. This is your first clue that you are watching something different from your normal Jim Carrey movie. I love the dialogue, camera shot, performances, direction, music, and running time of this movie. There is nothing I would do to change it. I came away from 'The Truman Show' feeling inspired which is the goal of good filmmaking Jim Carrey was outstanding as Truman, underplaying him, not making him too comic or too dramatic, but giving true sincerity when asked. He deserved an Oscar nomination. Ed Harris has always been a good actor, but in this movie he's a great actor. He plays Christof with such arrogance and bullheadedness that you don't know whether he's helping or destroying Truman. He and the director, Peter Weir, deserved their Oscar nods.Weir, who directed the great 'Witness', uses different camera angles to make you feel like you're actually watching 'The Truman Show' and not a movie. He ends it before you get tired of the concept and helped Carrey and Harris give immaculate performances. Andrew Niccol script is a real star in the movie too because of it's inventiveness and ingenuity. Overall, 'The Truman Show' is what I like to call a true American classic.",The Truman Show

Who doesn't feel lost with Truman against that ocean?Truman Show is a brilliant movie. Subject matter is equal parts entertainment culture and life in private bubbles, with some interesting side commentary about education, intelligence gathering, little white lies, family matters, mass marketing, and many things.I'm not too pleased with the Academy Awards to say that Carrey, Harris, and Weir should have each received more than nominations for this. Some people have a quiet modesty about accepting and supporting the choices of the Academy Awards, and there is cultural impoliteness in reaction to criticism of Academy Award judgments. I no longer understand why people should feel modest about a system they do not take part in, but I can understand that people believe they've taken part in that system when its judgments reflect their own. In any case, sometimes seeing great artists receive nothing more than 'Lifetime Achievement' awards as a concession for the judges overlooking them for so long is not very rewarding. People who work very hard should receive at least recognition; people who are good at their work should be rewarded. When an actor's career is marked, as Carrey's is, by numerous upsets against the Academy's judgment, it becomes obvious that the Academy has seriously lost its way.",The Truman Show

881,cragglewump,A true American classic?,8,5 December 2000,"This film is a satire in the highest degree. In no way is it an American classic - it tears the American Dream to pieces. Carey's perfect wife, perfect home, job and life all fall apart in minutes. This film stands next to Orwell's ""Nineteen-Eighty Four"" and Huxley's ""Brave New World"" in its world view. This film is sinister. It will leave you feeling monitored and paranoid, if you think about it properly. The premise that your world could be entirely manufactured and that your every move could be being watched intently by thousands upon thousands of people (Big Brother, anyone) genuinely scares me. The film also manages to strike at the concepts of advertising ( the scenes which involve this, with the two guys pinning Carey to a billboard, are hilarious) and product placement and places it more in line with the anti-capitalist, anti-consumer society message which flows from both American Beauty and Fight Club. All in all it is a great movie and is very moving, with an excellent performance from Carey.",The Truman Show

It had a huge impact on my life, as I'm still in high school, and want to escape from my current life, and find my true place in this world. This film connected with me because of that. Truman is slowly realizing that his life is a false one, and tries to rebel against the people controlling it, wanting to escape them and find his own path.But I do feel that Jim Carrey acted a little too goofy in some places. But other than that, a great performance. I loved the music too, it was kind of experimental. Dreaming of Fiji is actually how I heard of this film in the first place.

885,raiderz_thebestever,Great,10,23 May 2006,"I watched this in English and we had to do a review:Here it is:Teacher: Mr M. Mullin Due Date: 24/5/06English Assignment  Telling the story  Film ReviewThe Truman Show was released in 1998. The Truman Show was directed by Peter Weir. Peter Weir has had a lot of experience in his job here are a few: Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003)  The Truman Show (1998)  Fearless (1993)  Green Card (1990)  Dead Poets Society (1989)  The Mosquito Coast (1986)  Witness (1985)  The Year of Living Dangerously (1982)  Gallipoli (1981)  The Plumber (1979) (TV)  The Last Wave (1977)  ""Luke's Kingdom"" (1976) TV Series  Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975)  The Cars That Ate Paris (1974)  Homesdale (1971)  Three to Go (1971) And peter has got three movies coming out in 2007. The cast includes:  Jim Carrey (Truman Burbank)  a very different movie for what Jim Carrey would unsurely act in. He is more in the comedy movies and this is not that much of a comedy.  Laura Linney  (Meryl Burbank/Hannah Gill) A lot of movie experience starting from 1992-2006. As well as movies coming out in 2007.  Noah Emmerich (Marlon)  started movies in 1993 and is still in many movies today. Is different for this Noah because he is not normally a supporting roll is more a star roll when he is in movies.  Natascha McElhone (Lauren/Sylvia)  Holland Taylor ( Truman's Mother)  Brian Delate (Truman's Father)  Blair Slater (Truman as a boy)  Peter Krause (Lawrence)  Heidi Schanz (Vivien)  Ron Taylor (Ron)  Don Taylor (Don)  Ted Raymond (Spencer)  R.J. Murdock (Production Assistant)  Ed Harris (Christof)  Adam Tomei (Network Executive)  Paul Giamatti (Network Executive) I really enjoyed the movie and thought that it was serious but at the same time tricky and funny. I really like where Truman would always say Good morning, and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night! I thought that it would was a nice thing to the movie. This movie is a littlie bit confusing and does take some time to understand. The movie starts with Truman living normal life and slowly finding out that something is wrong. Truman is the star of a hit show that is played 24/7 no adds or other programmes. He eventually finds out about this, and for time between then he has been acting all weird. Truman then become his old unmoral self again and makes the movie very cool. His life is a lie. He trusts many people and all those people are actors and are just making money of Truman. They are always told by Christof and the rest of the company what to say and what to do. The movie shows you a scene where the set is above the Hollywood sign. I feel that the movie ends in a fantastic way, the T.V show producer (Christof) talks to Truman trying to convince Truman to stay so that he can keep making money. In this scene Truman walks towards a door that he eventually exits from. This image makes it look like Truman is walking on water, while Christof is talking to him so it looks like Jesus is walking on water and God is talking to him. I loved the movie and I thought that it was well worth watching. I liked the way that the movie got a person that was funny and could be serious at the same time. The Truman show was great. Even though it was old and some people found it boring, I liked it.",The Truman Show
886,ache-18163,Relevant Commentary on the Mass Media,10,7 September 2019,"I found the Truman show to be a very interesting, through effective, satire. In Truman's world, everything is perfect, from his perfect wife, Maryl, to his desk job just a short drive away. In short, Truman is living the American Dream. What he doesn't know is that his life is just an illusion carefully tailored by a television producer broadcasting his every move live, 24 hours a day and that everyone in his life is an actor. After a series of small mistakes and mishaps by the cast and crew of the show, Truman slowly begins to question his world, peeling back layers of the giant set. In this movie, the producers of the show act as the media, constantly stimulating our minds with directionless static that, without careful attention, can fall onto our radar as all-consuming. Truman, in this show, acts as the everyday person, completely absorbed in our world of media, news, and mundane reporters. The repetition of Truman's daily life reflects our own, in this day and age. What, really, then, is our objective in life if we continue to live the same loop for so many years? We have goals, yes, but why are we still stuck in the cycle every day? I loved this movie because the viewer acts as both the observer and part of the issue at the same time. Because we were so focused on the story, we weren't aware of our surroundings in real life, which was brought into clearer focus when Truman became justifiably paranoid. The viewer here is both Truman and the creators of the TV show. This was an incredibly real movie, especially in this day and age where we are so engulfed in media 24/7 and I would recommend it to everyone, especially children who are more vulnerable to media influence.",The Truman Show
887,cfra-35481,Great Movie!,9,10 September 2019,"The Truman Show is a juvenalian satirical analysis on the effects of media and the manipulation media has on our lives and is extremely effective in targeting people who may not know how absorbed they are in modern day television and media. While some may argue that The Truman Show is in fact a horatian satire piece, the deflation used to downplay the actual inhumaneness of the show portrayed in the movie is only hiding the actual dark things going on, such as using ""plot twists"" to make traumatic event actually happen in Truman's life. The entire thing is an ironic take on Truman's life; Truman has no clue that viewers are watching his every move, while the audience and the viewers of 'The Truman Show', as both the show in the movie and the movie are named, are in on the false narrative set by the directions of the show. By inflating the viewership of The Truman Show and portraying everyone as constantly watching and being obsessed, the movie furthers its satirical intent of showing how obsessed everyone is with media, and how the media can manipulate our lives. The subtle innuendos of Truman getting subliminal messaging through the radio and television programs is also an innuendo to us as viewers, and is an eye opener as to how much we, to, are subconsciously impacted by the constant stream of information going on all around us. In the beginning of the movie, Truman is shown to be going about his daily life, just like many of us, and bumps into an object that seemingly fell from the sky. He later hears a program on the radio about how a plane flew past earlier that day, dropping parts as it went. Truman did not react at that time, but the connotation to the viewers was that it was an explanation to Truman that he didn't even consciously register, but was subconsciously filing away the incident with the explanation.",The Truman Show
888,hannahwheeler-78110,Very interesting!,9,11 September 2019,"The Truman Show was a fascinating movie that captures the idea of living life the way you want to live it and searching for the right thing until you have found it. In this movie, the main character, Truman Burbank lives in a town called Seahaven which is actually a television show. The beginning of the movie definitely has a few innuendos to what is actually happening. Everyone in Truman's town are actors and no aspect of his life is real, but he doesn't know this. Throughout the movie, the idea of having a ""perfect life"" is definitely inflated as a reason for why Truman should stay in Seahaven and why be kept unaware of what is actually going on in the world and what he is actually apart of. The actors all try to keep him in the dark and anything that could give him a hint to what is actually going on is hidden. This eventually leads to the paranoid side of The Truman Show. As we view Truman's world, we watch as he begins to find one thing odd and then another, until he is very paranoid and he wants to scrutinize everything in the town that seems odd. This was interesting to watch because as an audience, you already know what is going on. You are waiting and hoping that Truman will also figure out the truth and escape his fake world to, finally, live a real life instead of his artificial one.",The Truman Show
889,aavi-88892,The Truman Show Review,7,11 September 2019,"THIS POST CONTAINS A FEW SPOILERS ABOUT THE TRUMAN SHOW:
The movie The Truman Show has a huge satirical theme. The whole movie (and show) is about Truman, who is unaware that he is constantly being watched through secret cameras, and that everyone in his life is actually just an actor, and every event in his entire life has been staged.
This movie is still very relevant today, and might even be more significant. Since technology has improved since 1998, it's even more possible that there are small, nearly invisible cameras watching us. And there will always be the possibility that you're constantly being recorded, even if it's common knowledge that you are, such as cameras in traffic lights.
The Truman Show inflates the issue of cameras being just about everywhere by putting cameras everywhere in Truman's town, and it can be argued that Truman's character represents deflation. He's way too oblivious to his surroundings for way too long, which seems like a deflation of basic human intelligence.
This movie also uses connotation very well. In the beginning, strong, powerful words aren't really used that often, but after the movie reaches its climax, connotative words begin to appear a lot more frequently.
The audience of this movie is everyone in developed, fairly technologically advanced countries, and the target is likely the government or other institutions who may use cameras without permission or knowledge of the subjects.
The persona of the show is Truman himself, and is very effective as Truman realizes that he's being watched, and that everything in his life has been staged.
The Truman Show is practically based around a hyperbole. Everything that occurs in the movie, from the cameras themselves to Truman not being allowed off the island, are extremely overdramatized.
This movie also uses praise by blame and blame by praise to help get the satirical intent of the movie across. It ""blames"" Sylvia for trying to tell Truman what is happening. About a third of the way through the movie, the director/writer of The Truman Show is seen praising the show, and the entire movie shows watchers of the show completely invested in watching Truman.

890,cman-46144,The Truman Show: A Satirical Masterpiece,9,12 September 2019,"Just as a warning before I begin: this review does include spoilers! I personally believe that there are a lot of satirical messages in The Truman Show, but I think the most prominent is that the media is used to display people's lives in whatever way they please. The Truman Show targets the media, and displays the problem of media manipulation. This idea is exaggerated by Truman being the media's subject matter without consent for every moment of his life. We see this in real life with celebrities in paparazzi photos and reality TV shows, although, contrary to Truman, celebrities are aware that the world has their eyes on them. Throughout the movie, we see the producers of the show plant subject matter into Truman's life, such as his father coming back to life, or all the advertising for hot chocolate. This can show how the media manipulates people. In the movie, the inhumaneness of Truman's situation is deflated. The movie is ironic because Truman's audience knows that he's on television, but Truman does not. I really enjoyed this movie, especially after having realized the satirical messages hidden within it.",The Truman Show

892,cassandra_sweetheart,"On the Air , Unaware",10,12 June 2006,"￼￼Truman's dadMy Topic - # 1 Cassie Sharpe 8-4Chistoff's view of his created world is that it is, well to him, PERFECT. To others it would seem to be cruel, sick, unkind, corrupted and unusual to have a person TRAPPED in a world that is not real. I feel that it is a very strange thing to do to another living human being. Every thing Truman does the studio is prepared for. They know how to deal with him and his sudden actions. There are thousands of actors with one little ear piece. But there is one specifically. Truman's best friend since kindergarten and the one Truman trusts the most is Marlon. But Marlon is also the one who has to lie the most. Even though he doesn't want to he does. One of the most ironic quotes from the movie was said by Marlon as he talked to Truman. This is what he said "" Truman the last thing I would ever do is lie to you"". As I look at all of the personal and public things Truman has said or done, I disagree with Christoff's view of the world.In the dome that Truman's life is taking place, Truman is the only thing that is real. In the dome, there are more than 4,999 big and small cameras. Which, are placed all over the little town with lights and speakers. It is a little scary that everywhere you go someone is always watching you. At the beginning of the movie one of the lights fall from the very top of the dome so far up you can't even see it. Of course on the radio the next day they announce a plane was losing parts while flying through the air. Lucky for the studio and Christoff, Truman believes it. As for me I would become suspicious.Christoff, working as the main producer is a very smart guy. He really knows how to make a really good show. A very thoughtful quote from Christoff was, ""We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented"". Meaning, every problem, every speed bump we hit we will over come because we can deal with what we know we can handle. I think that this statement is a very true one, because if you are really set to some thing you can overcome any obstacles because this is what you really want. This quote is a very smart quote from a very unusual man, a monster some would say. some like many others too. I think he is an awful man and Lauren thinks so too.Lauren is a female actor which Truman meets at school and talks to in the library. Lauren tells Truman she is not allowed to talk to him. Truman replies with a cheesy answer ""Yeah, well, I can understand that, I'm a pretty dangerous character"". Lauren is determined to tell Truman the truth about his life. As Lauren takes Truman to the beach to tell him the truth she begins to tell him that they are coming for her so they need to talk fast. She also tells him her real name is Sylvia and that she is an actor and so is every one else and that his life is real but his reality isn't. For me, I agree with Lauren/Sylvia, if I were in her shoes I would tell Truman as well. A car comes rolling in. Her father jumps out and tells Truman they are moving to Fiji. As Truman grows older, he becomes determined to move to Fiji!Truman, as determined as he is, goes to a travel agent to book a flight to Fiji. He sees tons of warnings and safety precautions of why NOT to fly on airplanes. They say ""we can book a flight for you in July next year. Fiji is very popular"". Truman decides he wants to sail there himself. Truman is terrified of water ever since he was a little boy, because the studio made his father die/drown in the water. Christoff being so smart, made it so he would never sail away. I feel that it was a very smart move but still it was really mean to kill off some one who is so important to a child. But Truman is seriously determined to get out of his small town. Once every one is asleep Truman sneaks away, he tries to sail away. Christoff has a determination for himself: Not to let Truman escape. He thinks up a storm, literally. The storm is so huge he almost kills Truman. An associate says ""you can't kill him in front of a live audience"" Christoff replies with a smart but true answer ""He was born in front of a live audience why can't they be part of the end?"". As Truman recuperates from the storm he runs into a gigantic wall with his boat. There are stairs. Truman leaves and successfully got a real life. I believe that Christoff's view of the world was wrong. It must be scary to always be watched by someone you don't even know, or maybe its fun to always be the center of attention. I believe that you can do anything that you set your mind to. Truman worked hard to find out the truth once he knew something was wrong. This is a good way to be. In the end, I think that it is a good way to live your life. You need to be persistent and truthful and go with what you know is right.",The Truman Show

896,l-18929,Truman Shows us How to Live,9,22 January 2020,"Truman Shows us How to LiveThe Truman Show sets a good example for other movies, with hundreds of creative camera angles and shots. Music, one of the three sounds of film plays a drastic role in the structure of the movie. The score is mostly classical which sets the stage for the rest of the movie.
The Truman Show, directed by Peter Weir and written by Andrew Niccol, takes place on the man-made ""Seahaven Island."" The movie begins with Truman (Jim Carrey) exiting his home to commute to work. The sky is bright blue with a few clouds here and there. A day most would consider perfect. He greets his neighborhood with a smile and just before he enters his car, his neighbor's excited dog jumps up and greets Truman. He enters the city and the audience is introduced to a pair of twins named Ron and Don Taylor. The twins inconspicuously push Truman's back against an advertisement which is perfectly in frame of a close-up shot. This exact set of events happens everyday at the exact same time. This is where the audience really has the opportunity to puzzle these pieces together on their own. Once Truman arrives in his office, he makes a private phone call to an airline service in an attempt to book a flight to Fiji. We the audience are shown that Truman does not wish to continue life on Seahaven Island.
The issue with leaving the island is hidden from Truman. Seahaven Island is a live TV show, with everybody being an actor except for Truman. There is a group of people standing in protest of The Truman Show due to the unethical nature of the plot. One protester (Lauren Garland, played by Natascha McElhone) was able to contact Truman by disguising herself as an actor. They go on a small date and she begins dumping truth into Truman's ears. She explains that nothing he ever experienced is real and the whole island is made for him. Her father who was actually just another actor collected her and before he left, he told Truman that they're moving to Fiji. This is the reason Truman wants to leave Seahaven Island.
Take into account that he was born on live TV, and continues to live on TV. The Truman Show captures the emotions one would feel if they were forced to experience everything in life being fake. Once Truman begins to discover what his life truly is, he does things unexpected and erratically. One example of this is Truman walking into his office building and immediately back out, then entering another. The stage crew never expected Truman to be in that building, and when he called an elevator, the door opened to a group of movie employees on break. They quickly try to cover up the mistake by having security throw him out of the building. While this is all happening, we are viewing a close-up shot of Truman with loud classical music as he breaks the simulation. This music gives the entire sequence a sense of unknown. The look on Truman's face reflects utter confusion along with determination. The confusion that Truman is able to convey when his father who supposedly died at sea is rushed off the set by men in black. By using Truman's emotion we're able to empathize with him and that is one of the biggest factors to making a good movie. Assuring that the audience is involved in Truman's conflicts allows us to experience the movie, not simply watch it. The director's motive with this strategy is to completely blow other mystery movies out of the water. Comparing this film to other psychological mysteries shows how devoted Peter Weir was in producing an effective film.
The goal of a good movie is to engage the audience, allow them to make assumptions about the film and come to their own unique conclusion. One story is split into hundreds simply because we all have our own experiences to draw comparisons to.
The Truman Show receives a positive review from me for a lot of reasons. Those reasons being: Suspense, Humor and the biggest being Creativity. When I watched The Truman Show for the first time I was astonished. I believe that this film deserves a spot on everybody's Top 10, the camera angles and positions emphasize the fact that they're hidden.

In this film the main character Jim Carrey was very controlled and likable compared to other movies he has stared in such as the Mask and Ace Ventura.This movie the 'Truman Show' is about a man called Truman, who has been put in a fake world since birth and everyone around him is acting. This world is placed in the middle of Hollywood and everyone is watching him from their TV sets.I think the main point the director was trying to put across was that maybe the perfect world would not be a good place to live eg.

One day an ex-show member Sylvia(Natascha McElhone) appeared and tries to tell him that ""it's all fake"", ""none of its real, its all a show"" etc so his wife and friend Marlon have to convince him otherwise. But he got curious and tries to escape and the creator tries to stop him but he insists on being free. Jim Carry's character is a little calmer and less crazy compared to movies such as Ace Ventura for example but makes up for it in other ways. This is a really good movie written by Andrew Niccol and directed by Peter Weir.",The Truman Show

909,nick_kumagai,what i thought of The Truman Show,8,24 July 2006,"The film ""The Truman Show"" is based around the character Truman Burbank(played by Jim Carrey). His life was filmed all day every day. The world and everything in it was made for him and he starts to notice it.The director Peter Weir did a great job on this film. It was as if you were looking into Trumans world he also showed us what he thought a perfect world was, The style was like it was in the fifties.I really enjoyed this film because it was a very original story. Jim Carrey played Truman Burbank really well his role was believable. If you liked this film then you would like eternal sunshine of the spotless mind",The Truman Show

912,stefanheatherbell-1,good,5,24 July 2006,This film was about a character called Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey)who is in his own world which is a television show. All of his friends and family are just actors in the show and he is oblivious to this.I didn't like this film because it was not my kind of movie. I felt like there wasn't enough action for my liking.Jim Carrey was funny. He kept me engaged. this was the best thing about this movie although I liked his performance less than I did in Bruce Almighty. I thought he was not as funny. The Truman Show was not as exiting as Bruce Almighty. There was not as much action.To make this film better they could have added a bit more action.

The main characters are Truman Burbank and Meryl played by Jim Carrey and Laura Linney. The movie was about a person called Truman that has spent 10909 days (his whole life) in this fake town doing his day to day activities like anyone would not knowing that it's all fake and a setup. An idea that the director wanted to get across was that realty and unreality are ideas that people should think about in your life and sometimes you don't know what's really real and what's not. I would compare the Truman show to The Mask because Jim Carrey although in a completely different movie still acts well.,The Truman Show
915,wee_woman77,My review !,6,24 July 2006,"I think this movie was great as it hasn't been done before. The Turman Shoe is a popular t.v show around the world. It's about a man call Truman Burbank (played by Jim Carrey)who is living a pretty normal life, well thats what he thinks, but really there are 5000 cameras watching his every move. Some things and ideas I think the director was trying to get across were that a perfect life may not be so great after all as things don't change.I enjoyed this movie more than other films Jim Carrey has done such as ""The Mask"" and ""Me, Myself and Irean"" as in these movies Jim Carrey is very funny and in The Truman Show he is normal and serious.I would rate this movie 6 out of 10.

Overall I thought it would just be another boring movie the teachers show us every year. Due to medical reasons I had to watch this movie at home which meant I had the chance to watch it all in one go, which was amazing. I started off the movie trying to make myself pay attention but this movie quickly drew me in. The plot was insane, I would've never imagined anything like that. The story got progressively better and I found myself screaming for Truman to keep going at the end. It was an extremely interesting plot line. The only thing I didn't like is kinda the ending because I thought it would be so difficult for him to live his life after his life being a simulation. They tied everything together so well. Amazing acting from Jim Carey. The plot thickened as the movie went on and it took so man turns. It was a beautiful story and it was told very well. Overall just an amazing movie, drew me in quickly and I couldn't stop watching. One of the best movies I've ever watched.",The Truman Show

The acting is phenomenal with Jim Carrey playing a character inside another character. It's mind blowing to say the least. It is one of the greatest movies ever made especially in the time it was released.

Truman show is the tv show movie about Truman. Truman is an ordinary man in the city on island. But he never know he was filming all the time. Until one day, the big spotlight fall down to the ground. And a lot of strange stuff happened to him. Then he started to realize and try to escape the island.
For the acting skill I just thought Jim Carrey played just Rom-Com movies. But this one on the drama scene. He did it so well so touched my feeling. Every character, they are in to it.
I really like when they put the border in the picture to be the camera frame. It made a feeling, we are the audience in Truman show
I think the music in this movie is really ear catchy. While in the movie, I just felt like I've heard this soundtrack before even it's my first time watching this movie.
Ending is really sarcasm, they watch Truman for all of their whole life. But when he get out from that world, they just change the channel. Watching another movie
I don't know what to say, This is one of the best movie I've ever seen. I like this movie a lot. The end just made the audience felt empty. Like the audience watching him for so long. When he's a child. When he steps the first time. But the end is right. He needs to have his own life, he needs to get out and live his own life.

Also the part where Marlon speaks to Truman ..is excellently shot very unpredictable which takes one's emotion and sympathy fro Truman to par...hey but the concluding part in fact the last line by Truman... you never had camera in my head brings out a great controversy.....too good and a must watch movie,The Truman Show
925,guomuchen,Immediate thoughts,6,12 May 2021,"My favorite part is actually the uncanny advertisement delivered by Meryl during her conflict with Truman, very ironic... the ending is a bit less intricate but also thoughtful. Not intricate enough because I think the portrayal of Truman's escape as his grand success simply omits the fact that he will never obtain the ""real"" life he desires given his global popularity. But I also like how after celebrating for Truman, the audience immediately turns to another show, mocking how insignificant and short-lived our passion is.",The Truman Show

930,Lee1,Fascinatingly in-depth satire,9,12 November 2002,"I had to analyse this film for English at uni and it was amazing to see the depth of themes and characterisations. Peter Weir has taken on many subjects to portray (reality TV shows, commerce, Christian allegories etc.)but he handles this excellently and leaves it up to the audience to decide their own views. My favourite two scenes are: when Truman's father is reintroduced and the event is 'orchestrated' by Christof; and also at the end when Truman is sailing and hits the edge of the studio. The acting was top notch: in particular Jim Carrey, Laura Linney and Ed Harris' performances were stunning. I must also mention the music- it captured the moods perfectly. In short, The Truman Show is a brilliant film: I can't recommend it enough. And yes, Jim was robbed at the Oscars :)",The Truman Show

932,cansoral,Some viewpoints from the Truman Show,9,13 June 2007,"In this movie, Truman thought he was a normal man, had an insurance job, a beautiful wife, neighbors, and some friends at first. But the truth is cruel. Trumen Burbank, is actually a well-known leading character in a TV series called ""The Trumen Show"". All of his movements have been recorded by cameras, sent to worldwide by satellites, and at last, shown by the TV monitor, and have been seen by most of the people around the world. Having read the novel ""Running out of Time""? Jessie Keyser, the young leading character in this book, has the same situation with Trumen. Living in Clifton in 1840, she didn't know that many eyes have watched their life until her mom told the truth, about the outside world in 1996. It just let me think about those celebrities. They have been chased by some paparazzi since they became a focal point. ""Princess Diana's accident"" might proved this. Some odious paparazzi, no, ""spies"" would said,""This is just my job."" for excuses. This movie told us, that the importance of the right of privacy and respectability to the others. Each person is an individual human being, not just a toy or a monitoring object.",The Truman Show
933,tessamessenger,An awesome film totally worth a look...,9,7 July 2007,"Reality TV shows, whether it's 'Big Brother', 'Shipwrecked' or 'Wife Swap', you either love them or hate them! In our world, wannabe contestants would give anything for their five minutes of fame whereas in this Paramount Pictures flick we have Truman; blissfully unaware that he is living in a fake reality and has become a global household name.Truman Burbank is a simple man with a simple life - he has a perfect wife, and a fairytale home; what more could you ask for- right? Every day it's the same thing, greetings, run-of-the-mill insurance job, corny commercial advertising and his never ending search for a lost love. All desperate attempts to escape from the world of Seahaven end in failure. Of course, there is no escape. The clues are all there: stage lights falling from the sky, even the radio talking to him. Whenever Truman comes close to discovering the truth about his life, all the evidence is buried under a clever web of tricks and lies. From buttons to bowler hats, secret cameras have been plastered all over the neighbourhood and they're watching. 'Born a star', Truman's whole existence has been broadcast to the planet from womb to work, in the largest TV stage set of all time! Actors create a trained community of friends, lovers; even relatives, while the 'God-like' Christof (Ed Harris) gets to recite such lines as ""Cue the sun"", while concealed in his spacious viewing office hidden behind the moon. Natascha McElhone is cast as Lauren; Truman's bona fide love, quickly pulled from the show for attempting to tell Truman his true identity. Truman's father (Brian Delate) was also cut from the show early on in a boating accident resulting in Truman developing aqua phobia. Wier has managed to produce a small backbone cast so perfectly suited to their on-screen roles that you could say they were born to play them! However, these characters are only the framework of the movie giving the films major star Jim Carrey a chance to shine through.Naturally the success of this blockbuster hit would have been nothing without the presence of Jim Carrey and his leading role as Truman. In previous films Carrey has delivered first class comedy performances resulting in nation wide admiration for his cringy, OTT comedies such as 'Ace Ventura' and 'Liar Liar'. It doesn't matter if you've never liked him before. In this film Carrey has become a real human being (for the first time) and creates his character with powerful, captivating emotions never seen before. A masterfully moving performance with the perfect balance of humour and solemnity; Carrey deserves top marks for making 'The Truman Show' one of the biggest films of the year! Films this great don't come along often. Clever, funny and thought provoking; this big hit blockbuster has it all. You will never look at a reality TV show in the same way again",The Truman Show
934,ntrumpet89,"Fantastic Idea, but poor execution.",7,15 April 2008,"There are just a few things which I feel that don't fit with the premise of the story. First of all, I feel that the musical score should reflect how Truman is feeling rather than the fictional characters who are viewing ""The Truman Show"". I also think that the part of the story, when Truman is unaware that he's on a TV show, should have been extended in length. I don't know the name of the lens where the viewer sees just a circle of the screen, but I don't think it should have been used. If the camera was positioned to make the viewer THINK something was wrong, but not be quite sure, I think it would have been better. I think that soley unique camera angles would produce an awesome effect (and a greater ""Wha????"" moment when we realize Truman is on a show).

938,pink_gummi_bear1,And everyman of modern times,5,21 February 2008,"Truman Burbank (Jim Carey) is the most famous person in the world and he doesn't even know it. He was raised being filmed around the clock and the star of a reality viewed all over the world. The simulated reality television show  ironically called The Truman Show exists inside an enormous dome with simulated weather and its own ocean, completed with over 5,000 cameras. Following some strange occurrences, Truman starts to think that he is being watched. Little does he know that he is soon to find out that his whole life has been broad-casted globally. Truman Burbank is a normal man, with a normal wife, a normal job. He has a normal life. At least that is what it seems. Truman fear of water stops him from ever leaving the perfect little town of Seahaven, or to see the woman he really loves. Lauren (Natascha McElhone) is Truman's high school friend/girlfriend. She knew about the Truman Show and tried to tell him about it. She was taken away. The creator of this simulated reality TV show, Christof (Ed Harris) controls all aspects of Truman's life in Seahaven, like whom he meets, what he does, and everything in the dome. Christof's antics are a little bit unpredictable. You don't know if his actions are trying to help or ruin Truman.The film is set in two time zones. The outside world is set in modern times, and in the dome is set to seem like it is from the 50's era. This movie includes flashback of when Truman is a child, including when is father 'died' causing his phobia of water.Starting of as a comedy, it is soon realized that this movie has a deeper meaning. One example is when Truman looks like he is walking across water to a door that opens into a black space. The director (Peter Weir) seems to be trying to show an example of Nirvana. He uses different angles and Mise En Scène so it feels like you are watching The Truman Show and not a movie. Peter Wier has used the art of cinematography well in this movie.The audience that watched the Truman Show are a group of people who wanted to be entertained no matter what the consequence to Truman. It reminds us of soaps, paparazzi, and how we like to know about celebrities, and overall how the product could be the death of someone like Truman Burbank.",The Truman Show

It sounded weird and almost Sci-fi, but it was none of those things. It was actually a really good movie. Jim Carrey is perfect in this. It gives him the chance to really shine as an actor, combining the comedic and the dramatic to get an extremely likable character. Its his best role, in my opinion. And, honestly, he is the reason to see this film because I don't think it would be as interesting with another actor. I really liked the soundtrack to this film as well, it was very moving at times. The rest of the cast also did a fantastic job. The Utopian scenery blends in perfectly into this film and makes it all the more interesting. Its a great and different type of film that should be seen by all. It never strays too much in the goofiness arena, and is always endearing and believable.GREAT IDEA AND VERY GOOD MOVIE!",The Truman Show

Truman is told what to do, who to be and where to go through the people around him, to make good television, just like the public are told the same things through the media and through government. i think if you look closer than the exterior of this film, the viewer can find a much more interesting concept than just a story of a guy stuck in a TV show",The Truman Show
942,kolomiec-maria,The Masterpiece!!!,10,9 December 2008,"""The Truman Show"" was directed by Peter Weir in the 1998. It's the first serious, dramatic role of the striking actor - Jim Carrey. This film is fantastic and dramatic. It won the ""Gold Globe"" and the ""Blockbaster entertainment"".Truman lives in the town, where all the people - actors, all that surrounds him is decorations, but he doesn't know it. This town is a giant studio which had been built by the director of this project. Truman doesn't understand it up to the day when one woman tells him that everything set up. And after that he starts realizing that everything goes by the round. Everybody in the world observes this show and looks forward to the end of this story. They wake up and turn on the TV ""The Truman Show"". They go to work and watch this show there. They fall asleep with the channel turned on. In the end of this story Truman finds the exit of this studio, in spite of the difficult way there.As for me, this film is one of the best films I've ever seen. It shows us and our life. It shows that a lot of people don't think about another people and think only about entertainment. This film shows us insignificance of our life. However, it shows the strength of will every person too. The scenery is beautiful. The background music is perfect. The brilliant performance makes this film more interesting and breathtaking. When you watch this film you willy-milly remember the words of celebrated writer - William Shakespeare: ""All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players"".All things considered, I can say that this film is a masterpiece.

943,mayankgupta_in,Simply Brilliant,10,3 September 2014,A movie is worth watching if it shakes you or simply remains in your mind hours and hours after the show ends. The Truman show is one such thought-provoking piece of artwork that remains with you for long after the curtain falls. It is not a comedy but a satire on the life of a common man; the man that does not look beyond the obvious; the man who continues to live within artificial boundaries; the man who does not open his eyes and seeks the truth; the man who does not see that this world is fake; the man on whose expense the world is having a laugh.

Though I'll never relive the experience of watching it for the first time, this movie is still phenomenal.  Underrated, this film seems to have attracted a cult following; everyone I know who's seen it (which isn't many) loves it.Jim Carrey, Ed Harris, and Laura Linney give wonderful performances in this film about reality and unreality, fears and desires, and God/human relationships.  I can't identify one overarching theme because this movie deals with so many different philosophical ideas, as well as raw emotions. Just watch it and be amazed.",The Truman Show
948,Russ60,"Worth watching, even if you're not a Jim Carrey fan.",10,21 April 2011,"Jim Carrey is primarily known for his silly characters and odd roles. However, ""The Truman Show"" truly shows how brilliant he can be. Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) has lived his entire life, literally, in a virtual reality. His entire life is broadcast on television, completely without his knowledge. His wife, friends, co-workers, everyone on the street are all actors. His existence is essentially created by a producer named Christof (Ed Harris, showing his own brilliance). The theme of ""appearance versus reality"" is apparent throughout the entire movie. Truman believes his life to be real, when it fact it is very controlled. The ""townspeople"" are all linked by radio earpiece to the producers so that they may receive instructions to keep Truman from discovering the truth about his world, the smallest cameras ever made are utilized to capture Truman's every move and the show even has its own satellite in order to broadcast 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. ""The Truman Show"" has been the most popular show on television for 30 years, literally since Truman was born. Eventually, Truman begins to suspect that something is amiss, such as a stage light falling out of the sky, an elevator without a back, even an alleged nuclear power plant meltdown when he tries to escape town keeping him from leaving. His suspicions become so strong that he eventually confronts his wife Meryl (Laura Linney) with them and she accuses him of having a nervous breakdown. At this point, Jim Carrey shows his acting talent and transitions from comedy to drama. The effect is profound and Meryl drops character, screaming that she can't work under these conditions and that it is unprofessional. Eventually, Truman realizes that his reality isn't real and escapes the town. The camera angles in the movie were interesting, many times using a fisheye lens to give a bugs' eye view from a wall or from behind Truman's medicine cabinet mirror. The cameras are scattered through town, Truman's house, workplace, even worn by the actors. Christof even admits in an interview that ""We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented."" ""The Truman Show"" seems to be the predecessor of modern reality television. It's touted as ""reality"", but it is heavily controlled by producers and an on-site crew and, at times, is scripted. ""Popular Mechanics"" listed ""The Truman Show"" as one of the 10 most prophetic sci-fi shows in 2008. Director Peter Weir actually stated ""This was a dangerous film to make because it couldn't happen. How ironic."" when predicting the rise of reality television. ""The Truman Show"" certainly stands out among movies, especially when compared to modern reality television. Even if one isn't a Jim Carrey fan, ""The Truman Show"" is definitely worth watching.",The Truman Show
949,troywarrior,Great,10,24 May 2011,"The Truman Show may be approached on one level as social satire exposing the emptiness of an American Dream defined by consumerism and purveyed by the electronic media over the last half century. Life in ""Seahaven,"" the vast dome-enclosed set/community in which Truman (Jim Carrey) has been raised under the watchful eyes of a worldwide TV audience of millions, is a sharp and elaborate parody of the corporate sponsored images of middle-class American material bliss and innocence first introduced to mass television audiences through such '50s sitcoms as Ozzie and Harriet, Father Knows Best, and The Donna Reed Show. A closely related target of The Truman Show's satire is the pervasive voyeurism and passivity that has increasingly characterized American social behavior as witnessed in film (ED TV), entertainment television (tell-all talk shows, Reality TV, the talent search genre), and even broadcast news (disaster/victim footage).Yet, on another level, The Truman Show, like Gattaca, The Matrix, Dark City and other more obvious examples of science fiction, deals with broad philosophical themes such as free will versus determinism in human action, subjective versus objective perceptions of reality, the assertion of humanness through existential rebellion, and the quest for an authentic self/ identity. Most immediately, the names and plot functions of the film's two principal characters - ""Christof,"" the megalomaniacal producer/director of a 24/7 reality TV show, and ""Truman,"" the show's eponymous everyman figure - invite the viewer to approach the work allegorically.Legally adopted by a corporation (in a clever parallel to virgin birth), manipulated by the all-seeing all-powerful Christof (Ed Harris) into phony friendship and empty marriage with actor-minions, and psychologically conditioned (i.e. terrorized) into fearing adventure and change, Truman gradually begins to suspect that Seahaven is not the paradise it purports to be. To assert his humanity and escape his artificially prolonged state of childlike ignorance, Truman must ultimately undertake that most mythic of journeys, a Sea Voyage. At its end, he must turn his back on the secure, controlled environment of his ""heavenly"" father's house and step through a forbidding black passageway that leads to the true human condition: emotional and physical risk, scary freedom, and - perhaps - real love. In so doing, Truman ironically brings to his TV audience (whether they are still capable of appreciating it or not) the very affirmation that the false god of television claims they receive from the contrived ""hope and uplift"" pabulum the show has been ladling out for 30 years along with its subliminal primary diet of product placement advertisement.In its climactic scenes, The Truman Show reveals Christof to be neither a social visionary nor a benevolent deity. Rather, we learn he has much in common with Orwell's Big Brother and - allegorically - with the implacable, sadistic god that Melville's Ahab imagines is running things behind the sky's impenetrable veil. By literally rending the heaven of his imprisoning universe, Truman navigates his storm-tossed sailing ship toward a completion of the heroic quest that Ahab's mad distraction (and Melville's theological uncertainty) forestalls: he momentarily frees himself and us from the diabolical/divine puller of the chains of human fate. In its final act, The Truman Show recasts the tragic despair of Moby Dick as comic triumph.",The Truman Show
950,Leafgreen,A Movie for Thinkers,9,21 June 2005,"I just got finish watching Truman Show for the first time. Really excellent! Consider that Truman's world is the same as your mind. You create your reality every day with the way you think, your perception about things, the programs/scripts that you follow subconsciously and consciously.How many times have you found yourself doing something even though you know you shouldn't? You think you are doing so with your free will. Are you? Yes, if you always make rational choices. But it isn't possible for a human being to make rational choices for the thousands of actions we take each day. Many are automatic. Further, our emotions are largely subconscious and automatic. Think about people who are very emotional, and how little control they have over themselves. Thus the term ""prisoner to your emotions."" To the extent your thoughts, feelings, and actions are automatic, you are a prisoner in a world of your own making.Consider that we are all being controlled by others to some degree--other people, other people's thoughts, other people's patterns, other scripts, the media, the government. Any time you allow yourself be led, you are being controlled in the same way. Now, this isn't always a bad thing, and most of the time it's a good thing. Consider what civilization has built with leadership: medicine, safety from anarchy, space travel, food, shelter and grand buildings, and so on. Consider too the horrific worlds which Hitler, Pol Pot, Stalin and too many others created. Will we let this happen again? Yes, if we let our minds become imprisoned by a leader like them, again.At first I thought the premise of the movie was silly from a legal standpoint: The TV Truman Show (in the movie) would be unconstitutional since it deprived Truman of liberty. I also thought it was implausible that an actor would commit a good portion of his/her life, as with Truman's wife, just for a chance to be rich and famous.But wait...we know that the movie makes obvious statements about greed, with the product promotion in the TV show, and Christof's goading over the show's ratings. Perhaps then the movie creators were suggesting that with intense lobbying by media companies, Congress could pass laws to make such a TV show possible, depriving Truman's liberty for his entire life. Scary thought, but think about the results of lobbying in the real USA: tax credits for SUV's, our government's position on global warming, industrial mercury emissions poisoning our children.

951,johnzahra2,The Truman Show - A Big Review,9,1 November 2012,"Truman Burbank is an ordinary guy in an ordinary little seaside town of Seahaven Island where nothing really happens. Everything is clean, everything is perfect, he knows people but never really connects to anyone. The one woman he ever really loved is not his wife and has long since left for the other side of the world where he longs to visit but feels he can never go. We are shown that every turn he makes, every attempt to escape is blocked by malevolent simulators and high tech manipulators intent on keeping him inside. He is watched 24 hours a day, seven days a week and his life televised as a form of entertainment. Paralyzed by his fear of water since seeing his father die on a boating accident, Truman still feels he is missing something. A strange light falling from the sky, a man who reminds him of his dead father, a strange radio broadcast and the feeling that the world really stops when he shuts his eyes all combine to make him feel something is wrong.Some of the positive aspects of the film are that Truman is a well looked after person. He is treated kindly by everyone and has been given a normal life to live in ""I've given Truman the chance to live a normal life"" says Christoff. Relationships with our family and friends are the most important thing. We see this through times when Truman is upset or needs help. He goes to his mum and best friend Marlon for support and they help him out. His mum talks him through his problems and acts like a normal mum would while Marlon settles his problems over a 6 pack of beers. The audience also has something to watch on television. Live for the whole world to see 24 hours a day, 7 days a week people watch as Truman goes through his everyday life, Christoff makes money and the audience have a show they enjoy watching.Some of the negative aspects of the film are that Truman never actually had a family. He is trapped inside a fake world (town of Seahaven) where every single person except him are actors and he begins to become aware of the situation he is in. He is being misled into believing the lies that have been constructed for him to keep him unaware of the real events occurring around him. We realise that Trumans wife is just an actor playing a role, in which she was placed, she had no real emotional feelings for Truman. She is just playing the role of his wife and so Truman's sense of love and relationship is distorted. Whenever Truman tries to go someplace far he is always blocked. From the sudden masses of traffic to the apparent nuclear meltdown Truman can never escape and will be trapped inside a fake world until he finally has enough, faces his fears and sails a boat into the horizon. Overall this is a great film about Truman trying to find his way into the real world. When everything seems like it doesn't add up, it just keeps getting more complicated for him. In the end Truman couldn't handle it anymore and the will to live couldn't be quashed by anything. Not even television.

The Plot is very intelligent and its a kind of movie that has never seen before and its charm will last while the years pass. This isn't a new movie, it is pretty old actually but every time i watch it, it makes me feel the same as i felt in 1998 when it came to our cinemas.

955,auctungdaddy,Peter Weir is very underrated,10,5 January 2004,"Peter Weir is one of the most versatile directors ever, with all of his movies covering a vast amount of subjects. But the other day, I realized something else about him that is quite fantastic. He has taken several actors who are known for playing a certain type of role, and put them in challenging roles that have changed their careers, such as Jim Carrey, Robin Williams and Harrison Ford. I watched Ace Ventura the other day, and was blown away by how annoying Carrey was in it. Almost all of his films before Truman Show were equally annoying. Yet Weir was able to turn him from a one-trick pony into someone that delivered one of the best performances i have ever seen. The same can be said for Williams, who was not known for his dramatic acting abilities, yet Weir cast him in a role that was quite touching. Ford was known mainly as an action star before starring in Witness, but in that movie he gave a realistic, brilliant performance. All i can say is WEIR IS THE MAN",The Truman Show

I wasn't able to describe it but I felt like I needed to watch that movie again. Not many movies give me that strange impression that I had and I'm pretty sure it was the first one.

A movie which has never been done before. The Truman Show is one such movie. The whole concept of Truman Burbank (which I will not spoil for you guys) is without a doubt an idea that I never saw before in a film. Jim Carrey who plays him is at his very best. We all know him as a really big comedy star, but there's a reason he's in the business he's in. Dude is a great actor. Ed Harris is fantastic in a supporting role which more or less is pivotal to the entire story and the sets built are magical. The movie itself is magical, the best film of 1998, one of the best of the decade, Peter Weir's best film, and a perennial classic that will hit on many issues.",The Truman Show
961,lollyandspan,Caught on camera,10,13 December 2012,"Are you being watched 24:7? A paranoid Lauren Gardner finds herself rummaging around to find hidden cameras after watching the Truman Show. The entire world is watching literally every time Truman makes the slightest the move. This hilarious eye-opening film by award-wining Peter Weir includes the character of Truman Burbank, who is completely unaware that his whole life is an unending soap opera (running for over 30 years) for consumption, by the real world. Everywhere he turns, everyone he talks to, everyone he thinks he knows, are just actors paid to be part of his existence.The Truman show has many messages for the general public to consume, I think the most important message is that the media has the power to control every aspect of our lives so easily, and how so many people can be brainwashed into believing that something is so much more important than it actually is.In this surprisingly touching 1988 film - in the genre of comedy-drama – written by Andrew Niccol and produced by Paramount Pictures, Jim Carrey gives his character of Truman Burbank emotional honesty and comical intensity. Whilst other members of class include Laura Linney as Meryl, best supporting actor Ed Harris as Christof, Noah Emmerick as Marlin and Natascha McElhone as both Sylvia and Lauren.The movie is based around the character of Truman Burbank – a life insurance sales adviser, he has a successful career, a beautiful wife, a close friend and a very nice house. Nevertheless, he isn't satisfied with his life. Since he has never left his hometown of Seehaven, he begins to feel the urge to go and explore the world. But as his wife neither understands nor listens to him and everyone discourages him not to go away, Truman begins to feel alienated. To add to his growing dismay, a series of strange events unravel in his life, which lead him to suspect he is the victim of some kind of conspiracy. This show for me was 5 stars because of Jim Carrey who executed his role of Truman Burbank perfectly. if you loved this PG movie you will live Mr Poppers Penguins which also stars Jim Carrey, it's a hilarious family movie a lot like this one.

962,bullnaomi,The Truman Show by Naomi,6,13 December 2012,"The Truman Show Have you ever wondered 'what if my life is actually a film?' Well, for Truman Burbank, that thought is a reality.... As the camera starts rolling and our 103 minute journey begins, we meet Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey), a man who has been filmed since the day he was born. He lives in a made-up world with a made-up family in a made-up town full of actors. Meryl (Truman's wife) is an advertising 'perfect' wife as far as the eye can see. Many other reviews that I have read of this film (I do my research you see), have praised Laura Linney (Meryl) as a star actress. While the part is played to perfection, the fake demeanour is so obvious to viewers and so unclear to the gullible character of Truman. I however, find Meryl's character the only blemish in this film. I am not criticising Linney's acting skills, but the personality of her character. I find the fake and false charade grates on me and I find myself wanting to slap the practised-in-the-mirror smile right off her face. So while I can tell you the flaws of this film, I can also tell you its highlights. It's a funny, happy comedy in a sort of could-be-a-pantomime way. I liked it, I didn't love it, but it's a family film all the way through. My criticisms are trumped vaguely, by the staggering figure of $125 Million box-office takings (It started with a $60 Million budget). This film takes an unusual and unique approach to the family film market, no princesses or castles and while you could say it has a happy-ever-after ending, the cliff-hanger toned it down. It may not be the best film, it may not be the funniest but it was good. Kids will like it. 3 out of 5 Stars.",The Truman Show

Alex Charlton now is paranoid and is always looking for hidden cameras after watching 'The Truman Show ' starring Jim Carrey Plot: The whole world is pretty much watching Truman's every move but he doesn't realise. His friends and family are actors as his life is made up. Truman tries to go on adventures but the under cover actors around him persuade him out of it. In the end Truman starts to be aware that it's all lies. Review: In my opinion, the film is funny and entertaining. The acting was believable and it's a great story line. At the beginning you have to pay more attention to understand what's going on and what's happened to Truman. Ed Harris, who played Christof, was nominated for 3 Oscars as best supporting actor, best director and best writing/ screen play. The Truman Show is a PG certificate and the genre is comedy and drama. Also it was first realised in October 1998 but still really popular and still good quality. The budget of the film was $60 million and the box office takings were $125 million, just from the cinema takings alone, which is a great achievement and great fro the show. It helped that the producers of this show was paramount pictures, a very popular company and it was directed by the amazing, Peter Weir. If you love the big brother serious then you'll definitely love this, however, you don't have to love it as I don't because I still enjoyed The Truman Show. I give this film 4 stars out of 5.

969,grumph,Review of all aspects of the Truman Show,9,3 January 2005,"The Truman show sits on a genre crossroads, with comedy, drama, romance and thriller all coming together to form one of the greatest films of the 1990's.The island of Seahaven is not far off being the perfect place to live, it is inhabited by the friendliest people of the United States, and with scarce litter and impeccable weather it is almost too good to be true. For all his life Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) thought that his lifestyle was no different to any other American's, with his perfect wife, delightful neighbours and 'loyal friend' Marlon (Noah Emmerich) who pops round with a four-pack of beer every now and then. It is when suspicions mount in Truman's mind, as to why members of the public ignore him if he runs in front of a moving car, or don't so much as turn a head if he curses in the middle of the street, that the plot line begins to unfold.As he strings together proof of his suspicions, Truman begins to plan his exit of the conspiracy that he feels is going on around him, at this point we meet the ""all powerful"" Kristof (Ed Harris), who is the director/producer/creator of the hit television program; The Truman Show. After meeting Kristof the audience realises that Truman is permanently being surrounded by a hive of actors and actresses, who improvise their everyday lives to create this haunting illusion of reality, so that Kristof can continue to run the world's most popular television programme.Kristof doesn't just want to make money from The Truman Show; he wants to mould the perfect man, by acting as the puppeteer above Truman's life. Kristof adopted Truman as a baby and from that day forward has put every emotion, thought and experience into Truman's head; I think that Kristof's character wants to create a world that contradicts the real world of poverty, crime and war.The Truman Show only concentrates on the last few days of Truman's life in Seahaven, but with the use of flashbacks the scriptwriters manage to give the audience a wide perspective of what has happened in previous episodes of the show - which were somewhat faulted by 36 year old Carrey attempting to play an 18 year old boy, a feat that not many actors can achieve without the help of plastic surgery. Needless to say these flashbacks inform us on the first girl that Truman ever loved: Sylvia; a rebellious actress who met Truman as a teenager, and attempted to tell him the truth before being thrown off the set by protective producer, Kristof.Director Peter Weir creates the idea of reality television by filming most of the movie with ""hidden cameras"". So wherever he goes, the fact that we are seeing Truman through a keyhole, or a car radio adds to the theme of the movie. I didn't tire of this, but at some points I couldn't help but wonder how there was a hidden camera filming Truman from underwater, but it's hard to enjoy such a momentous film if you pick out mere technicalities like that.The plot is tightly evolved around the idea of Truman feeling trapped, and he attempts to escape this incredulous lifestyle of perfection on several occasions.These actions conveniently allow Kristof to display his power, by trying to psychologically and physically stop Truman from leaving the island, using subliminal hints on the radio, and graphically showing aeroplanes being struck by lightning on posters. These unsubtle methods were one of the funnier moments of blatant censorship in the film, but when they fail to change Truman's mind, and he sets sail to leave the island, Kristof directs an electrical storm to strike his boat. This great film has got the nail biting climax that it needed to make it memorable in the film industry for years to come, as the film to create the craze of Reality TV.The Truman Show would almost definitely make my list for the top twenty films of all time. It gave Jim Carrey the boost in his career that took him away from his 'less sophisticated roles' such as; ""Ace Venture, pet detective,"" ""The Mask,"" and ""Dumb and Dumber."" This serious roll as Truman Burbank proved that Jim Carrey has got more than one genre of acting style, and since then he has continued to show his true potential as an actor in recent hits; ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" The Majestic,"" and ""Me Myself and Irene."" One thing that I hold against this film is that it began the reality TV plague that Britain has been infected with for the past six years. Programs like Big Brother, I'm a celebrity get me out of here, and Pop Idol have leached off the prospect that Andrew Niccol thought of when writing the script; filming the everyday lives of people for the public's entertainment. The fact is, I can no longer turn on my television without seeing a disgusting northern family get filmed ""swapping wives"" with an ideal posh family, or watch a celebrity eat a cow's testicle, and then puke it up shortly afterwards: and I therefore put the entire blame on George Orwell, and Andrew Niccol (writer of the Truman Show).I first saw this film when I was 8 and thoroughly enjoyed it, the sunny setting and funny scenes of Truman in front of his bathroom mirror are ideal for pleasing the younger audience. The concept of Truman being watched wherever he goes is probably more haunting for adults than children, so therefore I would say that it is suitable for almost anybody, probably not a film for the claustrophobic though.The turning point of Jim Carrey's acting career, and a film that caters for any mood! 9/10",The Truman Show

971,bmwonderyears,genius movie that strongly applies to todays society,10,9 January 2005,"The Truman Show is an original and brilliant idea. It is a satire for how the media consumes us. Truman is a metaphor for the public. He is born into a false reality of life which is controlled by a corporation (christof). This relates to us because most of us grow up glued to the television, and hanging onto every word the media tells us. Most people don't realize the power of the media. It can run your entire life, as it did Truman's. The media shapes who we are in real life. We are shaped by about 5 or 6 major corporations, which own everything around us. In Trumans case, he is controlled by one corporation. Christof will go to any extreme to give the fans what they want. At the end of the movie, he makes the whether so stormy that he almost kills his movie star for the sake of ratings. This is only a slight exaggeration of the extremes that the real corporations will go to for higher ratings. The real corporations tell you everything wrong with you, and they tell you the exact way you have to be in order to be acceptable to society, just so you will buy their products or watch their t.v shows. All of these ideas about the media are expressed in the Truman Show. Their are so many subtle, but important details about the media that are overlooked, so you pay close attention and watch it over and over if you need to.",The Truman Show

Until he is 30 years old he doesn't recognize that his whole life is a lie, but after some time he gets suspicious and he tries to get out of his world. Jim Carrey, who plays the main character Truman, acts in a crazy way and gives the film a special funny touch which makes it even better. In contrast to Truman the other characters are acting more seriously which is an advantage for the film because if everyone acts in Carrey’s funny way , the film would have another effect to the viewer.

""An insurance salesman/adjuster discovers his entire life is actually a TV show.""I knew from start what was happening... thanks!!! :)quoted from other:When I first saw 'The Truman Show' I came out of the theatre amazed. This is your first clue that you are watching something different from your normal Jim Carrey movie. I love the dialogue, camera shot, performances, direction, music, and running time of this movie. There is nothing I would do to change it. I came away from 'The Truman Show' feeling inspired which is the goal of good filmmaking Jim Carrey was outstanding as Truman, underplaying him, not making him too comic or too dramatic, but giving true sincerity when asked. He deserved an Oscar nomination. Ed Harris has always been a good actor, but in this movie he's a great actor. He plays Christof with such arrogance and bullheadedness that you don't know whether he's helping or destroying Truman. He and the director, Peter Weir, deserved their Oscar nods.",The Truman Show

It was the first proper 'adult' movie I'd ever seen (being only about nine) and I was a bit skeptical, but the story line intrigued me so I gave it a go and loved it! Truman's character is truly suited to Carrey's acting style, a seemingly effortless portrayal is pulled off which gets the audience laughing and crying along with him. A must see movie for anyone of any age. Peter Weir made it the perfect balance of funny, disturbing, heart-breaking and hopeful, and Carrey's portrayal of Burbank is phenomenal. The concept was one that had not been explored very much before the movie came out, and is one that has intrigued people and made us all wonder about our very existence, with other TV shows and movies adopting a similar concept and doing well. A great family movie. I possess the Great Directors Collection edition, which really goes to show how much Weir is admired for his direction of the movie and how it will be watched and remembered for many years to come by the old and the young alike.",The Truman Show
976,thecutem,The Truman Show,9,23 September 2013,"""The Truman show"" was a movie that shows Truman Burbank's life as a reality TV show, without his knowledge since his birth. Jim Carrey was Truman Burbank, and his wife Meryl Burbank played by Laura Linney. Truman's best friend Marlon was Noah Emmerich. Christof, The creator of the TV show, was Ed Harris. Jim Carrey was able to mix his silly comedy with thoughtful drama, and the script provided new experience on drama movies.Fighting for freedom, thinking of ways to run away, believing in his feelings, Jim Carrey performance was amazing. After having the curiosity that something is wrong, He tried many times to discover the way to run away, but most of the time he fails. Truman's courage increased in every scene in the movie. Christof was trying to keep Truman under control by directing the actors to what to do next. Until he decided that he was ready to die to get his freedom. Truman said, ""Is that the best you can do? You gonna have to kill me."" Also, every other actor in the movie tried to stop him from his wife, best friend, and secondary actors. Meryl tried to break him down every time he was thinking to travel by reminding him of their financial responsibility. ""I think you should save for a few months, and then go,"" she said, she was laughing. Again, his friend tried to convince him that their city is the best place in the world by touching Truman's feelings by his words, ""look at that sun set Truman, it is perfect."" Every actor did a great job in this movie by involving their emotion in their acting, and that helped to make the audience connect emotionally with the movie.The romance, the drama, and the action in the movie had become from the script. The script helped the actors to have many ways to express their feelings by the words they were saying or by the action they were doing. Marlon said, ""He is goon,"", ""Cut transmission,"" frustrated,Christof react. Additionally, it rearranged the idea of the drama movies by adding a little romance, action, and comedy to the drama to make the movie suitable to all tastes. Fighting against the storm,looking to the picture of his love, looking to the bright sun, Jim Carrey was successful in mixing all these feeling in one scene. Directed by Peter Weir, written by Andrew Niccol, starring by Jim Carrey, ""The Truman Show"" was a great movie to watch. It had a new experience that made it different from the rest of the drama movies. Skilled actors and a precise script made it one of the best movies that involve the audience emotionally and make them react with every scene. Truman was trapped in his life, and there were people controlling his live. That left viewers thinking if they trapped in their lives, or there is someone controlling their lives.",The Truman Show

978,NotSoWeird,It is a overall great movie,9,18 October 2014,"Truman Burbank(Jim Carrey) is a unsuspecting star of a television show named The Truman Show with billions of viewers around the clock. The show started even before he was born, with thousands of cameras all around him he's life's being broadcasted 24/7 and everyone around him his family and all his friends being actors so the director Christof(Ed Harries) can ""guide"" Truman through his life. But Truman starts to suspect that something is wrong.To try and stop Truman from finding out the true nature of his life Christof have started several disincentives for Truman, like ""drowning"" his father in a boating accident(The set is on island surrounded by water), constantly running news reports on how dangerous it is to travel and show's stating how good it is to be home. Even with Christof's control Truman falls in love with an extra named Sylvia(Natascha McElhone) who Truman knows as Lauren instead of his designated wife Meryl(Laura Linney). But Sylvia quickly get's ""thrown"" of set with the excuse that her family is moving to Fiji. Truman marries Meryl but still loves Sylvia in secret. During the 30th year of the show running Truman starts to notice weird thing's about his perfect life like almost getting crushed by a falling light, the car radio pickups the camera crews radio broadcast following him around and he see's his dad who snuck on to the set, so Truman sets out to find out about his true nature even though Marlon(Noah Emmerich) his best friend tries to talk him out of it.I never really liked Jim Carrey's overreacting I just thought it was annoying and cringe worthy at best, but he's acting in this movie was much better than usual. And with great acting from the supporting actors like Ed Harris, Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Natascha McElhone and more, they made this movie a good time watching.

The film is certainly uplifting due to Peter Wier's brilliant direction and it works brilliantly. The idea is a bit far-fetched (I'll be truthful, it is incredibly far-fetched and will never happen) because creating a world within a world is not humanly possible. Forgetting about that, it's very enjoyable and has one of the best ending climaxes I've ever seen in a film. The Truman Show is like nothing else and is different for all the right reasons! I don't normally like Jim Carrey (In-fact, I hate him) but I loved him in this film and I'd recommend it to anybody.

A powerful allegory displayed by the TV show in which everything is fake pushes us to ponder about own world. The conversation between the director and Truman is the best scene of movie as it compares the real life with the fiction one of Truman. Truman choosing to leave the show seemingly steps into liberty but is it so?In addition i see similarities between the frequently used cave allegory of Plato and this movie.

The main character, Truman Burbank, stars in a wildly popular television show about the picture-perfect little town of Seahaven, which resides inside a large dome in Hollywood, California. The ultimate goal is to entertain the general public by filming the life of one citizen's entire life without having been given consent to do so. Therefore, everyone in the town is an actor, and everyone in the world knows about it Except Truman. The Truman Show is an example of many satirical aspects, including a central problem, irony, and connotation. The movie goes into great depth about how Truman's life seemed so perfect to everyone, until he finds out and he does not find it so perfect. In our society, everyone believes everyone else's lives are so much more perfect than their own. This is highlighted in the way that the movie directors have no idea why Truman is so anxious to get out once he starts to uncover the truth. Additionally, we find ourselves heavily identifying with Truman, and feeling his same pain as he struggles to break free of the world that was created around him. The world revolved around him, and it was all that he wanted to escape. The directors of the The Truman Show in the movie often disregard the fact that Truman is human, not a caged animal to be observed. They also fail to realize that his fighting for his freedom is more ethical than them trying to keep it away from him. Indeed, they often make it seem like the end of the Truman Show is the end of the world, but it's only the end of Truman Burbank's involvement in a world that was never real. The Truman Show is an excellent outlet for realizing and correcting our own human flaws of ideas of perfection and the lengths to which we will go to quench our own entertainment needs.",The Truman Show
988,khei9798,Truman Show & Satire,9,8 September 2014,"The Truman Show sheds light on the flaws in the ""perfect society"" conceived by many people throughout time. It shows how this kind of ""utopia"" is not what the human race needs and in a way how when we have all the things we need, we find issues with it and other things to desire. The film possessed various elements of satire, using a strong persona, tone, hyperbole and irony. Truman's tone and view at the beginning was basically the view of people that think this society is possible and a good idea. Towards the end, his tone changes which propels the audience to continue to agree with the movie's creators or to change their mind completely. In the film they also use hyperbole in the case of how much all these people care about this random guy's life, and they over exaggerate the perfect sunshiny place that Truman lives in. Although this movie is about sixteen years old, it definitely still applicable to our society today. Now it relates to not only watching people's lives on TV (like Keeping Up With The Kardashians) but with social media, whether you are ""watching"" people you know on Instagram, Twitter etc or if you are following the lives of people you do not know on YouTube or Vine. Although this takes on a much different purpose, The Truman Show could be related to the Hunger Games in the way that there is a central power that controls everything, and the weather-controlled, camera monitored dome is very similar to the arena used in the Hunger Games. Overall, I liked The Truman Show and it shows how these seemingly perfect utopias cannot exist, while being a fun light-hearted film.",The Truman Show
989,gmad8332,"The Truman Show is a great satire, worth rewatching today",9,9 September 2014,"The Truman Show tells the story of Truman Burbank, who unknowingly plays the main character in a TV show all about his life. Themes of the movie, including how the media influences our thinking, the perversity of advertisements, and the lack of privacy we have in our day to day lives (although inflated) draws many parallels to our lives today, making it more watchable now than when the film first came out. The direction that the producers want to send Truman in is made clear through thinly masked dialog. When Truman starts to reach his mid-life crisis and want to travel, his friend, Marlon, tells him that, ""You don't have to leave home to find out what life is all about."" Today's news stories are being targeted here, based on how they typically lean in one direction or another, rather than report only facts. The Truman Show airs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. With a broadcast schedule like this, there is no time for advertisements, so advertisements are worked into Truman's life. Marlon is never present without a beer in hand, and Truman's wife is constantly promoting kitchen and gardening tools right in front of him. To see this on the show seems a little ridiculous, but from giant billboards to short ads before youtube videos, there aren't a whole lot of ad-free places in our lives today. As the main character of The Truman Show, Truman Burbank is on camera a lot, meaning he doesn't have a whole lot of privacy. When the show's creator, Christof, is being interviewed, the interviewer thanks him for the opportunity, saying, ""We know how much you value your privacy."" It's ironic how this man values his own privacy so much, but can allow Truman to go on without any. Today we have a lot of issues with privacy, namely with the NSA monitoring scandals.

Though this movie was created a while ago now, but it is still just as relevant in today's society as it was then, if not even more pertinent. With shows like Jersey Shore and Big Brother, reality TV has become a large part of our lives today, but we never really stop to think about the people on TV's privacy.

Other times you are chanting on the other side wanting the story to continue.

993,kpet2333,The Truman Show is a Perfect Satire,10,10 September 2014,"The goal of this piece is to point out how violating reality television can be. The movie shows a great example of inflation, as Truman was essentially a prisoner that was used for entertainment. This movie is extremely satirical, as it has dark undertones throughout. Even the way the actors had product placement was slightly unnerving. A good example of the unnerving feeling the audience gets, as well as of irony, was when Truman's ""best friend"" was being fed lines and said ""I would never lie to you, Truman."" It also is there to emphasize just how cruel the entertainment community can be.This satire also shows that not everyone can be trusted, as even Truman's supposed ""loved ones"" were just actors being paid to interact with him. It makes the audience think about who is in their life and if they're really there for them. The target for this move is people who watch reality shows or shows that exploit the ignorance of one or more participants. These shows, however entertaining, still are using the ignorance of one participant to entertain the masses. There was an illusion to God at the end, when the creator started talking to Truman. I'm not quite sure if the purpose was to cause an existential crises, but that is how it affected me as an individual. It was very powerful, because the man who had protected Truman since the beginning was the only thing standing between his escape. Lastly, the most powerful and well used instance of irony was that all of the people who religiously watched the Truman show were the ones who cheered when he escaped.",The Truman Show
994,tmil8909,Calling Out the Media Through Satire,8,10 September 2014,"Jim Carrey plays the perfect persona for a problem that has become even more pertinent since this movie came out in 1998. Playing a man growing up in a made up city run by a TV show that broadcasts his life is the much more literal and inflated idea of the media controlling everything the public sees. Weir targets the media and how they never give anyone any privacy. He shows this very literally in Truman's world, by showing his every movement and letting the whole world see it. The plot is a great use of Horatian satire to add the right amount of funny and light- heartedness, while also addressing the very real problem. It makes you laugh, but also cheer for Truman while he tries to find out the real truth of his world. The emotional connotations bring you closer to what Truman feels and how life changing an experience he is going through. You can see the fear and anger going through Truman as he finds out more and more about world. You can also see this fear in the director of the Truman Show, but for a very different reason; the fear he might lose the person he has grown up controlling and directing. The deflation of Truman's right to privacy can go hand in hand with what can happen in todays world. It may not be on the same level of the public watching your every move, but today, people can always be in contact with each other and see what everyone else is doing through social media and cell phones. Overall, the Truman show is a fantastic story that can be enjoyed at a simple level while you can laugh at Truman's world, but also enjoy it at a much much deeper level where his predicament can stand for much more serious real world problems that have become even more true 16 years after it was made.",The Truman Show
995,ejoh7336,The Truman Show is an excellent movie with many different satirical elements to enhance viewer experience,9,10 September 2014,"The Truman Show is an excellent movie that uses many different literary tools of satire to improve the storyline. It uses tools such as irony, deflation and target effectively within the plot. It uses irony to illustrate how he can't leave the island because he's afraid of water, yet at the same time yearns to travel. This is highlighted throughout the entire movie as he considers leaving to travel and find a certain someone. The other bit of irony found is when the director says that Truman can leave at anytime if he really wished to. However, you see that he is blocked at every turn trying to figure out what is going on and trying to leave. It's also a blame by praise thing. The director of the show and everyone who watches doesn't see Truman as being free to live his own life, making the viewer realize that he really isn't in charge of his own life at all, no matter what the people behind the camera want you to think. In fact, the people behind the camera are the ones controlling his life.To go along with that, they downplay important values that are essential or at least taken for granted by us. Values such as freedom to do what you want, privacy and the right to your own life. His life is not his own, essentially. Yet, he is deceived into thinking it is. I feel that the target of this piece of satire is audiences who take for granted the freedoms that they are given such as, the freedom to your own life and the freedom to your privacy.",The Truman Show
996,beva5748,"Great Movie, But Also Ironic",9,10 September 2014,"The Truman Show is an amazing movie that makes you think of how we live our lives differently. With the main problem being that the main character is trapped in the same town by a fear of water where the whole world watches the every second of his life, the purpose of the film is to show how the media can manipulate people's lives. It's ironic how Hollywood would be displaying promoting this message, when they do the opposite. The movie really inflates the importance of being yourself, while deflating the idea of having a life where you act on the will of others. It targets other sources of media who manipulate events of people's lives, including plenty of bias on their opinions. The audience of this movie could be the general public, to raise awareness of the problem, but also other mediums of media to show them how they can affect people in an extreme way. The satirical technique of ethos and pathos are used very often in the film, such as how the viewers see the wrongness of how Seahaven is using him without consent to make lots of money and popularity from a TV show. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie's point of view on the subject and how the director portrays the message as a movie taking place on an enormous movie set.",The Truman Show
997,ramos-bluejay12,A short review of the movie including the satirical evidences that are in the film,10,10 September 2014,"The movie ""The Truman Show"" is a satire about media and how self absorbed people get in it and how much it can become their entire life. Truman the star of this film is a literal example of this. Trumans life is a reality show. Everything about him, and everything he does gets broad casted to the entire world. Becoming peoples topic of obsession. The people who watch the show follow it habitually. The purpose of this movie is to target the entertainment industry and show them how ridiculous they are getting. It inflates the overall obsession of people to this show, to reveal that people do this regularly without thinking about it and without realizing how deep their obsession runs. This movie is still pertinent today because no matter how crazy it seems the way people follow TV shows has gotten worse. To where they follow them almost religiously. We have so many shows that are like this it is a major feat to count how many there are. TV has become an addiction worse than any drug and no one really realizes how bad it is until something like ""The Truman Show"" comes around and throws it in your face and says 'you're gonna take this and you're gonna enjoy it'.",The Truman Show
998,adamfailor,All the world's a stage,9,20 September 2014,"The Truman Show (1998) stars Jim Carrey as Truman, the everyday good neighbor in an idyllic seaside town. Unbeknownst to him, his reality is being controlled from behind the scenes. Truman begins to notice subtle cues that things aren't as perfect as they appear to be. The Truman Show points out our social desire to watch reality television to the extreme and shows the audience just how staged it all is.The Truman Show allows the audience to see Jim Carrey in a serious role. Often he has made serious points throughout his career, but always with a comedic edge. He tames his comedic expressions in order to appear the quintessential everyday normal man and yet is able to endear Truman to the hearts of the audience.When Truman's father attempts to tell him it's not real, he is removed from the cast of the show. Truman is told that he died at sea. This reinforces the fear of the open ocean that Christof, the director of the Truman show (Ed Harris) wants to instill in Truman. The final goal is to keep Truman contained. In college, Truman meets Lauren (Natascha McElhone) who falls in love with him and plans on revealing the truth. Again, Christof intervenes and she is removed from the show. When Truman fights with his wife (Laura Linney) a new love interest appears. His best friend Marlon (Noah Emmerich) appears to be more and more dangerous as he comes closer to the truth. Truman feels he is descending into madness. He counts how often the same car drives by to make his point. Stranger than Fiction (2006) also follows this line as a seemingly normal man begins to hear his life narrated.The Truman show starts off with a great deal of openness and lighting. Everyday appears to be a perfect sunny day. As Truman begins to notice things, the lighting starts to get darker. We see this when he tries to escape and is confronted by Marlon and later in the storm sequence. The lighting leads the audience to see just how unreal Truman's reality is. The openness changes as the film progresses. Early on the film uses wide shots showing the audience that the town itself is a character. As the movie progresses, the shots begin to tighten in around Truman. Yet even then the audience sees the enormity of Truman's obstacles in the final storm sequence. The camera pulls away from Truman and shows just how small he is against a seemingly vast ocean. When Truman's illusion of reality crumbles, he is finally free and no longer confined to a staged script.",The Truman Show
999,wgad4719,"This movie is about a ""reality TV show"" that goes incredibly wrong when suddenly it's not so reality.",7,23 September 2014,"The Truman Show is a juvenalian satire because it focuses on the greed of people. They kept a person from a very young age in a fake world, all for the purpose of entertainment and profit. The purpose of this is to show that people shouldn't sacrifice other people for their own gain. The director was holding someone prisoner without knowing about the outside world except for what he read online.The Truman Show was an incredible movie that shows what happens when Human Greed and Boredom go too far. A young child and then furthermore man was held prisoner for the purpose of other people's entertainment. This movie shows why we should never by into ""reality"" TV even today. No TV will ever be true reality. This movie illustrates that. Truman started to discover that he wasn't living in the real world. This ruined the effect of the show for the outside viewers. He's starting to realize that this isn't reality.",The Truman Show

Now I wish I had seen it before ! It's a really good movie, the tension increases slowly and you feel sad for Truman. It's not a simple comedy it has a profound meaning, it criticizes the reality show. It was released in 1998 but it's still modern unfortunately... After watching this film you will never look at reality show the same way ! Anyway, I recommend it. Love it ! After watching this film you will never look at reality show the same way !

Noah Emmerich almost steals the thunder from Jim Carrey but not without some of Carrey's trademark facial expressions. Ed Harris is brilliant as Cristof, the brain behind the show in the movie. I am disappointed in myself for waiting so long to buy the bare bones DVD just because the movie is so powerful.Jim Carrey is simply superb! Many doubted he could pull off such a role but he showed otherwise and without doubt is the true star of the ""Show"". Excellent scripting and editing, and seamless direction from Weir. It's arguable whether it will stand the test of time, but is certainly a modern day classic!Good morning good afternoon, and in case I don't see you, good night.",The Truman Show

Since it was shown I've watched it three or four times, occasionally nodding off (when tired), but re-winding to catch the bits I missed. It's turning out to be one of my favourite films of all time - a true classic. The ending is just brilliant - the script, the music, the bow, the exit etc. And Ed Harris really is superb in his role.I also love the way ""the show"" is only really introduced about half-way through, when the interview is done.

It was a great story about how a man can be born on a movies set where his whole life is fake. The movie pokes fun at reality t.v. and how they can change what really happens to something that would be interesting to viewers. It made you feel bad for Truman because he was trapped in a little town built inside a studio for the whole world to watch on a television screen.

1005,ahen-35753,"Interesting movie, even more interesting meaning",8,14 September 2015,"The Truman show is a thought-provoking film with a deeper analyzation of the coming digital age. In the film Truman seems like a typical man with an indefectible lifestyle. However, what soon comes to follow as a shock for Truman is that most of his life is a set-up and he is the star of a reality t.v. show. Truman's suspicions starts as a plethora of deplorable actions from the crew occur; from common mess-ups to breaks in character. He soon realizes that this is not the life he wants to lead and that there's something more than SeaHaven: the truth. One of the more interesting aspects of the movie is the fact that it is actually a very satirical piece. The film calls to notice media manipulation, it inflates the concept and uses a blame by praise to scrutinize the issue. If you do watch this I'd personally suggest actually looking into and interpreting the deeper meaning rather than just watching the movie without a thought. If you are more into Carrey's funnier movies only manufactured for laughs then I wouldn't suggest this in consideration of the fact that it hits closer to sci-fi, drama and is a lot more than just a comedy. All in all it is an interesting movie and definitely one of Carrey's better works.",The Truman Show
1006,mall-23584,A Classic Movie with Modern Themes,9,14 September 2015,"At first, this movie comes across as quite comedic, with very few hints as to what the underlying theme truly is. Truman Burbank, played by Jim Carrey, is a happy and well known denizen of a coastal town called Seahaven. His neighbors and co- workers are all great colleagues and friends, and he appears to have no enemies. After multiple uncanny events, he soon becomes paranoid and believes that he is being watched (which is dramatically ironic considering the circumstances that he is being watched). As he learns more and more about the reality of his world, he is quick to attempt an escape. Consequently, the actors playing as the rest of the inhabitants of the island try to sway him away from his beliefs, but fail in their efforts. Towards the end of the movie, he flees from the view of the cameras, and tries to sail to freedom. In a conflict between ethics and profits, the producer tries to kill Truman before he can reach the exit. Reluctantly, he is able to break out of the lie of the world that he lived in.As the plot developed, the true purpose of this movie emerged. The director of this movie inflated the issue of what the media does in a (desperate) attempt to increase their viewers. The fictional producer adopted an unwanted baby, which is good, but in hindsight, they enslaved him for the entertainment of millions. In note of the producers, the satire also addresses the argument of utilitarianism. Very few people rebel against the philosophy of entrapping an individual within a made-up world because the benefit of the majority is valued more than that of the individual. Even though this movie was released in 1998, its themes can still relate to modern day society because the media constantly goes beyond the boundaries of what is acceptable in broadcasted entertainment, with an ever-increasing acceptance of explicit and inappropriate humor and criticism.",The Truman Show
1007,rkru-39704,The Truman Show: A Witty Satire,9,15 September 2015,"The Truman Show is a satire showing the scrutiny actors and actresses undergo. The movie executes showing this issue by taking it to the extreme and filming Truman's life 24/7 without his knowledge. Although The Truman Show was written in 1998, the problems the satire is exposing are still pertinent today. Today with all of the new technology we have these issues are even more prominent. Stars can't go anywhere without something being tweeted, posted, or a news report about the latest thing they've done. Overall I enjoyed this satire and I think it really helped open my eyes to just how much stress today's and past celebrities are put under to keep up their appearances for the media. Not only was The Truman Show a good satire but it was a good movie as well. I was entertained throughout the whole thing trying to unravel the mystery behind Truman's life and what was really going on. It was fun trying to piece it all together and it never got boring. I also really liked that it was comical and lighthearted without being childish. I would recommend The Truman Show to anyone looking for a fun and witty movie.",The Truman Show
1008,owoh,A Satire About Truth,7,14 September 2015,"The Truman Show is a satirical piece about reality television. The satire has a bit of merit today because lots of people today watch at least one reality television show. People who watch reality television often do not think about the effects that this show has on its stars. The Truman Show is a good satire because it uses many satirical techniques. The Truman Show uses connotation when the lady is calling the show to try and free Truman. She uses the word, cell, to try and convince people that the director of The Truman Show is holding Truman captive, and that Truman would want to leave. The Truman Show is targeting the watchers and developers of reality television and saying that they should stop making reality television. The Truman Show is a hyperbole of the making of reality television because they greatly exaggerate the number of people and the amount on equipment that they need. In the show, the director says it takes the work force of a small country to run the show. The show, also, has a good bit of comedy. There are multiple lines that make the story seem very funny. Truman has lots of funny little jokes to keep the mood lighthearted. The Truman Show did have its worse moments. The show was not the best in the beginning because at first the story doesn't make tons of sense. The beginning has the director introducing the show, but it's the director of The Truman Show, which is watched by people in the movie. If you do not previously know that the movie is a satire, then you will have trouble understanding the beginning. The story does not make much sense until about halfway through the movie. Also, some of the people watching the show seemed very out of place. People today watch lots of reality television shows. Some examples are Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Dance Moms, and The Bachelor. These are some highly viewed shows. The Truman Show is still relevant today because of these shows. This satire is something that might need to be remade with today's technology because lots of younger kids will dismiss it. The real thing that makes it something worth remaking is really just the technology, the fashion, and the lifestyle. The Truman Show is relevant today, but just could use some modernizing for younger people, who are too young to understand this lifestyle.",The Truman Show
1009,eaud,Thought provoking,8,14 September 2015,"The Truman Show was a fantastically written story that keeps the watcher transfixed till the very end. The setup of the actors and the camera angles really did make it feel like there was something weird going on behind the scenes. There wasn't a moment where I was bored watching it. The moment I realized what was going on I was astonished. It's amazing how the satirical intent of the movie is very modern and can still be applied to today's entertainment industry. It made me re-evaluate how I saw the industry as a whole, as well as the media that surrounds it. The movie redefined what a ""private life"" was, and targeted the entertainment industry, and reporters that broadcast the private lives of those who are famous for a living. The movie made me realize that those involved in the entertainment industry don't really have a private life that they can hide from the world. Satirical elements such as irony was used when things in The Truman Show were described to be ""real"" and ""not staged"", there was inflation when they portrayed the idea of having no private life, because in real life, no one is actually filmed 24/7, and deflation was used to build the world, making The Truman Show, seem like a normal thing. Overall, the movie was an entertaining piece, and a fantastic satire that got it's point across to the audience.",The Truman Show

In the movie, Truman's life, although Truman is not aware, is actually a television show which is being filmed in the giant dome that he lives in where everyone is an actor and everything is part of a set. Throughout the whole movie, Truman becomes more and more suspicious that something is going on and he tries to find out what it is. Besides being funny, The Truman Show pokes light-hearted fun at society and while the movie was released in 1988, the satire is still very pertinent today. In the movie, it is clear how The Truman Show captivates the world to the point where it is all the people can focus on. This targets not just people from the past, but our own society today. The ongoing question throughout the movie is: Will Truman find his way out? Shouldn't he get to have a choice whether he stays or leaves? That is what makes the Truman Show so enthralling. A light hearted comedy with still some more thought-provoking themes, The Truman Show is definitely worth a watch.",The Truman Show
1011,kewe-27556,It was a show about Truman,6,14 September 2015,"This movie is a satire of modern media and its encapsulating effect on the general public. At the beginning, it is mentioned that the Truman Show is not just a job; it is a way of life. This is true for the audience of the show, as they are seen spending all their lives watching this show. One man is watching it in the bath. A whole bar is dedicated to the show, running it all day, every day. People have Truman Show memorabilia. People freak when the show stops airing for a small while when Truman is first found to have escaped. Even when the show does come to an end, they just decide to watch something else. Their lives revolve around the T.V. The show sucks them into this world. You are even shown this by the problem itself. You want Truman to leave, as do the people in the movie. You feel what Truman feels, want what Truman wants, and see what Truman sees. This movie is an example of the thing it's satirizing. The audience in the movie is a mirror of yourself when you watch it. The issue of the humanity (or lack thereof) in the movie is deflated, making you not think about how Truman is practically a zoo animal. We do this to unwilling T.V. stars all the time. When someone gets famous, we want to know everything they do. We make them an exhibit for us to watch. That was Truman's entire life, yet the issue is glossed over until it is brought up by his lost love. Of course, the entire piece is an inflation of T.V. in general. It takes the ideas of reality television and the money-hungry industry and takes it to an extreme. It takes a few well-placed jabs at the entire television industry and at the viewers, but it does fall a bit short. First of all, it is a movie. It is the media that it wants to bring attention to. This makes you wonder if the movie was actually made to bring attention to the corruptness of the industry or if it simply found another way to make money off of us and bring attention to itself. Second of all, the movie itself is not that satirical. You have to dig to find it, and even when you do, the satire never goes very deep. You, the viewer, have to add your own thoughts to make it truly satirical. The movie never blatantly states that is has issues with anything. This could just be a well-written story that just so happens to be satirical at times. Finally, this is just another work following a generic storyline we've heard countless times before. A character grows up in a Utopian, controlling society. He slowly learns about some major flaw in this Utopian world and his wish to leave is brought about. As he learns about how corrupt the world he lives in is, his wish grows. He eventually tries to leave, only to be stopped by those he loves, the society itself, and the creator or ruler of said society. He will overcome this and leave, only to join the real world or start their own modeled after today. This movie is a conversation piece, but one you'll soon forget about if it is not constantly brought up.",The Truman Show

It relates so highly to society today and how we constantly want to see famous people and catch them in their everyday life and paparazzi and tabloids make their reality, our entertainment, which is the main problem of this satire. This movie definitely seems to be more closely a Horatian satire rather than Juvenalian mainly because it is very upbeat and laid back. There are lots of innuendos that relate to the things we do in our everyday life. The author uses a type of irony called blame by praise by showing that the world he lives in is derived to be this happy perfect place when, in comparison to real life, it's not. The target of this film is most likely paparazzi and the people all around the world who get too caught up in knowing every little thing about every famous person's life. The film catches Truman living his everyday life, unaware of the fact that everyone is watching. It is a remarkably entertaining movie which sparks a lot of questions in your mind.

The whole movie manages to be one big hyperbolic metaphor for the societal problems and manages to strive towards fixing them in a blame by praise format due to the way that they show how great the show is, even though they are being incredibly unethical. Even with the beauty of this film's satirical elements, the movie managed to show other incredible aspects in the form of Jim Carrey performing in a more sensible role with none of the slapstick that he is infamous for, and the other thing to consider is that the biggest of the movie impact is the popularity of reality television that was sparked by its release, and how those shows still dominate a plethora of channels to this very day.",The Truman Show
1014,jwit-94904,Truman show analysis,7,15 September 2015,"The Truman show is an interesting example of satire, that is interesting, and entertaining. The movie is about a man who was raised on the set of a TV show, and knows of nothing else. I found the beginning confusing, as did others I know, but after half an hour to an hour, it will all fall into place and make sense. The satire in this piece is several layers thick, and much can be drawn from it. One of the main points is the comment on television. One of the things mentioned about what makes the show so entertaining is that Truman isn't acting and is thus very real to watch. This says some stuff into how TV at least at the time was not too relatable. Another comment was about how if it was too real, that can be weird, and not relatable. Some of the deeper stuff later, without spoiling too much, a comment is made by the director about how the real world is the twisted sick place, and the studio where Truman is is what the world should be like. This is a comment on how people perceive the world, and how people look at their own work. It is interesting he sees the world he created as the perfect version of the world, a vision of how it should be. Another message I drew from it was a comment on big brother spying. Whether it was intended I saw in the presence of so many cameras a comment on privacy invasions made by the government. I'm not sure if I'm drawing conclusions that aren't there, but as well as being entertained, I drew a good number of comments on society from this movie.",The Truman Show

He was born into a reality TV show where everybody is in on it except him. Early on in the movie Truman begins to suspect that something is up. Throughout the film, he tests his boundaries and tries to understand his surroundings. This movie is incredibly frustrating the first time that you watch it. But the next time and the next time it is amazing. Once you understand the story then there are so many minute details that are hilarious. Being a satire, this movie is most enjoyable once you figure out the deeper meaning. This movie demonstrates irony throughout; one of (if not) the first lines talks about how everything is completely real and what not. But in reality the only real thing is Truman. The film aims to change the lack of privacy given to celebrities and reality TV show stars.",The Truman Show
1016,amaz-76683,The Truman Show Review,8,15 September 2015,"The Truman show was a satire that I feel was aiming to target the way that people choose to live. I got to this because of a quote that sounded really strong and powerful, it said ""We choose to live in the world that we are put in"". I took this as saying that like Truman in the film we tend to get stuck in routines by whatever the world throws at us and we don't do anything to try and change it, like Truman who went into adulthood before finally realizing his whole life has been planned. This quote could also hint at the way the media affects how people live. Reality TV shows have been very popular lately and the fact that there lives are in front of the whole world to see changes them by not doing things to make them happy but doing things to make an audience happy.",The Truman Show
1017,acab-75700,Satirical analysis,9,15 September 2015,"This movie in my opinions is an example of Horatian satire. It plays off of two human follies, the want to control everything and our interest in things we have no business knowing things about. It uses deflation to make the incessant need for control seem normal by making it a TV show that everybody watches and also inflation at the same time by controlling every aspect of a man's life. But this also displays another human folly by showing that people often have an interest things they have shouldn't know about just because they are human and that is just a part of human nature. This is still prevalent to today because these issues are part of human nature and likely will never go away but people might eventually learn to control themselves and suppress these aspects. But in all this is the message that humans are messed up beings that we all have our faults and that we will never change.",The Truman Show
1018,nbur,A Great Satirical Movie,8,15 September 2015,"One of the most sinister, but still humorous, satirical movies to date, The Truman Show shows an actual world of reality TV. With an obvious target of reality TV shows and their viewing audience, this movie uses numbers of satirical tools to take stabs at what is a problem in the US and the world. From inflating the idea of advertisement in shows to the immense amount of irony, including a show filled with actors pretending not to be actors, The Truman Show carefully pinpoints the silliness of reality TV. This movie is also still extremely significant to today's world of reality TV. One show that comes to mind is The Bachelor. The Bachelor is viewed with much the same fanaticism as the Truman Show is viewed with in the movie. The Bachelor even has much the same concept as the Truman Show. People trying to do normal things in front of millions of people. The Truman Show even ends with a scene that is very similar to my sisters after the season end of the Bachelor. The show is treated like a life or death moment for them, then five minutes after the show is done they seem to forget about its existence. Overall a great movie that includes concepts that can even be used in present day.",The Truman Show
1019,eger-98589,Movie That Makes You Think,8,15 September 2015,"The Truman show is a comical and deep thinking satire taking a shot at how much the media plays a role in our views of the world. Ironically, Peter Weir reveals this to you from the Media in the movie. During the movie their is a live interview with the creator of the show, and when questioned on the morality of the show he replies with ""We accept the world we are presented."" This is a huge line in the movie as it is a clue to the underlying theme. During the interview there is deflation because he is saying something such as power of the media doesn't have much power but it actually has a lot of power. Another literary device seen would be the use of would be blame by praise. The Truman show, although having some people against it, mostly has an audience in love with the show. The show is praised along with the idea of the media. All this praise is once again just another clever mask that Weir uses to cover up the blame he is actually intending. This movie can very easily be tied to today's world. Media has more input on our decisions more than ever. So many news channels have reports and studies meant to influence the public's thoughts on their world around them. We are seeing this a whole lot right now as there is a presidential debate going on. It seems like every day there's a different poll on who is ""leading"" and has more supporters.",The Truman Show
1020,csim-55189,Truman is stuck in a world he doesn't know and has to figure out how to leave.,10,16 September 2015,"The Truman Show shows how fake our own media is nowadays. News, politics, advertising and public affairs are increasingly made up of theatrical illusions. Like our media, it is convincing and seems real with lifelike simulations. The fake sun that radiates false sincerity of the actor he believes to be his best friend. And it's flawless. There are almost no flaws that give away the illusion until things start to go wrong. Truman shows the symbiotic relationship we have with media and how we want to leave it but we can't break it off. It describes two kind of relationships we have with media. We either adore it and have everything to do with it or we don't get involved with it and are repulsed by it. The irony is very prominent as this idea is brought up by none other but the medial powerhouse, Hollywood.",The Truman Show
1021,amid-81237,A Great Satirical Movie With A Great Message,10,20 September 2015,"The Truman Show is an incredible, funny, and thought provoking satirical movie. This movie shows you how strongly media influences us through showing you the reality of someone whose whole life is built by the entertainment industry. One of my favorite parts about this movie is its use of satire. I would recommend this movie to anyone as it teaches a valuable lesson that everyone stands to gain from learning.Many satirical tools are used in The Truman Show to deepen the meaning of the movie. There is a lot of connotation in the film. For instance, the character Christof has many underlying biblical references. Christof is portrayed as god-like in many ways. First of all, his name has 'Christ' in it. Also, Christof's office is on a very high floor, and people tend to think of god as in the highest of all places. Furthermore, when people talk about Christof they tend to use names that are typically used to describe god. For example, when Truman comments about the beautiful sunset to Marlin, Marlin gives all the credit to Christof by saying that it is the work of 'the big guy up there.' The religious connotation of Christof is used to show how we tend to worship television, celebrities in magazines, and all other forms of media and the people in them. Irony is another tool that is geniously used in The Truman Show to develop the satire. Situational Irony is used to provoke humor in many scenes, such as when Truman goes to the travel agency and sees posters of planes crashing all over the walls. This is to dissuade Truman from leaving Seahaven, however it is also very ironic as posters exposing the dangers of travel are the last thing you would expect to see in a travel agency.This movie's lesson about the way too large role of media in our society is an incredibly valuable piece of knowledge. In fact the importance of this lesson seems to grow with time, as it could almost be considered more relevant nowadays than it was when the movie was originally made; this is because in the last decade, we have only increased the role that media plays in our lives. Overall, this movie is a great and hilarious satirical film that exposes how much media influences our lifestyle choices.",The Truman Show
1022,nmcc-36629,About a man named Truman who has a great life but is not happy with it. He wants to figure out why he is unhappy.,9,24 September 2015,"The Truman show was a very excellent representation of the things in life that people chase but cannot have. From the seemingly cliché lifestyle Truman lives, with friendly neighbors, a steady job, and even the typical adult look with his suit and briefcase, Truman lives the life that the average American in the 80s would want to have, and there is nothing wrong with his life at all. But is his life really perfect? Since meeting his first love, nothing in his life has seemed to be quite the same, and he wants to know why. This movie is a perfectly executed film about how the perfect life is unachievable, but his life may not be as great as everyone seems to think.The film was very well done. A few of the things that the movie did well were the way that it gave the main character, Truman, personality with almost everything he did, whether it be his personality quirks or the very catchy things he says, almost every part of Truman is extremely memorable. All of the characters meshed well, and had very good acting to go along with it. Despite being a funny twist on a problem that society faces, being the media and the issues with it, you do not really find yourself laughing at this movie. It takes a tone that really drags you into the thought processes and feelings of Truman using dark humor which is hard to catch onto. Going with the actual movie and its plot, many small things fit the movie perfectly to add to the overall experience, such as the soundtrack, and make the movie really great. The greatest part of the film is one that you will really feel upon seeing it, and it is the ending (no spoilers). It was perfectly executed and left a huge lasting impression on me after seeing the film, wishing that the movie was not yet over. Overall, the movie was well done, with a genius way of presenting a satire. If you would like a great movie that will require some thinking to really get involved in, this is the movie for you.",The Truman Show

Amazing story with an amazing Cast made the movie a epic. And this movie would be on my film list till i die And i recommend each and every person to see this. The intensity in each and every scene was watch worthy and i say no one would feel bored seeing this spectacular motion picture I recommend not to see dumb and dumber2 because it degrades the range of Jim.Now at first the film is slow but don't quit the movie pace increases as the movie goes on .Salute to JIM",The Truman Show
1024,bkin-90208,The Truman Show is an Excellent Film,10,8 October 2015,"The Truman Show is an amazing movie that shows many satirical elements. The film is addressing is reality TV. In reality TV shows, things happen that wouldn't normally happen in somebody in normal, day to day life. The target then would be the people who run these reality TV show, and change the way events happen on the show for ratings. For instance, there is product placement in Truman's ""life."" These show how the world is fake, and this addresses the fact that TV is fake. Commercials that talk about how great their product is, when in reality, the person is payed to say what they do. Another thing, is the deflation of all the problems in the world. The only problems that usually happen are minor, but when Truman goes to leave the town for Fiji, all sorts of problems arrive. I think that this is attacking the fact that reality shows start problems when things start to drag. There is a lot of deflation when it comes to the fact that they essentially are keeping a human in captivity for entertainment, which obviously immoral. There is also lots of irony, when Truman sees the elevator is fake, there is an elevator crash the next day. As well as that his wife is a nurse but she is grossed out by surgery. With his whole life a lie, we can see the impact not only of the lies on television, but the impact every action we make on other people's lives, whether the impact was good, or bad. This is still relevant to us today, not only because TV is still around, and these things constantly happen there, but because humans still interact with each other. With their actions impacting those around them and their lives', making this a must see for all.",The Truman Show
1025,bkir-05573,Truman Show Is A Pretty Great Satire,7,13 September 2016,The Truman show was a wonderful movie. At first you're happy with Truman and his life being a TV show star but soon after you realize Truman's whole life is a lie and you become overwhelmed with the hope that Truman will soon see past his false life and realize what is really out there beyond this fake TV show life. You also realize how bad it is that they are allowed to adopt Truman when he's born and make his life a TV show. This will most likely infuriate you as you realize what there doing here is completely wrong and shouldn't have ever happened. Then you have to consider what I believe to be is a satirical piece in this movie. I believe the satire part show how the government is in control of all of us and we are all Truman. Only by questioning what is right and what is wrong will we actually find the truth. The director is like the government. They want us to to stay in what they think is a nice place to shelter us from the real world. Even if we want to escape they will try to keep us in here for what they claim is our good. But really all they want is for us to stay here so that they can profit of us and live the cushy lives that they want to live.,The Truman Show
1026,hoe-59588,Life on the stage,10,8 December 2015,"You might have thought about a conspiracy theory before. The movie 'Truman show', released in 1998, is such a story, directed by Peter Weir who is famous for 'Dead Poets Society'. This fabulous conspiracy is conveyed to audiences by its impressive lead actor, Jim Carrey. Because the main character is played by Jim Carrey who is one of the most cheerful actors in Hollywood, there is feeling of melancholy in the end of the movie.The story takes place in a city called 'Sea Heaven'. Truman Berbank (Jim Carrey) is a normal insurance planner. Ever since he saw his father pass away in the sea, he has had a fear of the water. So he never thinks of going over the sea. He is living his life as he has always done everyday. However, one day he meets his dead father on the street. His father suddenly gets taken somewhere by two strange men. After that, he starts to doubt his life. Finally he figures out that everything around him is very strange. After he feel that, he begins fighting back to the situation.There are two memorable points in this movie. First, the movie actualizes a situation that people may have dreamed of. The city where Truman was born and grew up was a perfect setting for the show. Furthermore all the people around him were actors who deceived him to believe that the set is a real world even his wife. Because the story is based on common conspiracy theory, it could draw sympathy from audiences. Secondly, Jim Carrey shows that he is not just a light comedian. He proves that he can tell a serious story. However it doesn't mean he acts depressed. He delivers the message which is worth considering while he still acts humorously.If you see this movie, you may not feel very comfortable when end credits roll. 'Truman Show' keeps us thinking about life skeptically. However, we feel something warm after the movie. If you are hesitating which kind of movie between comedy and drama, choosing this movie would be perfect. Then Truman will welcome you with his characteristic greeting 'Good morning. In case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening and good night!'.",The Truman Show

Because in this movie is written the human being itself, in an only man.""We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented, it's as simple as that.""My personal opinion is that, if you are really criticizing this movie, you aren't really seeing the wonderful, incredible and creative story that compose The Truman Show.It's unique.",The Truman Show
1028,kirill_hellat,The end-of-millennium masterpiece,10,8 November 2016,"Directed by Peter Weir, ""The Truman Show"" comedy-drama art film gained manifold nominations, including 71st Academy Awards, 56th Golden Globe Awards and etc, as well as a chance to merit a rank of ""Top Box Office Film"" and, therefore, to be a testament to a ""universal acclaim"". What has engendered such a success?Being set in the Seaside, Florida, in the 1998, the story revolves around the Truman Burbank, who has been unsuspectingly living under the thousands of hidden cameras and been constantly broadcast-ed world-widely since his birth for the sake of ""The Truman Show"". Things go smoothly until he gets to know the counterfeit image of his life and endeavors to escape, pending the disaster to the show's well-fare.Staring the typecast comedian Jim Carrie as a protagonist in a dramatic movie could be considered as a bold decision. Yet, so as not to result in a science-fiction thriller as a manifestation of a ""Simulated reality"" as it is seen in the ""Special Service"" episode of ""The Twilight Zone"", by which the script writer of ""The Truman Show"" Andrew Niccol was inspired, eventually it turned out to be well-founded. Carrie's charisma and his dramatic performance lend themselves particularly well in the comedy-drama film, that now may seem to us more funny than dramatic. Additionally, the acting of the rest of the cast has contributed in the overall positive impression of the films, that fully involves the viewer, fires his imagination and gives food for thought. Even though the futuristic theme of the life in a simulated reality might seem rather unconvincing, the director managed to realize this idea and make us believe that it's quite feasible throughout the entire film.To sum it up, in my humble opinion, ""The Truman Show"" is truly worthwhile watching. Although having come out at the end of the last millennium, it signifies the timelessness by its futuristic plot. It may also act as a starting point for a viewer's desire to get an insight in humanistic and post humanistic theories that this film implicitly enacts, give it or take it.",The Truman Show

All is so clear and easy now. Jim Carey is excellent in the film, the 2nd last scene, where his boat dashes with the boundaries of studio and then he cries, vow that was too good by Jim. Hats off to peter weir. The concept of fear which with this world is controlled has been brought beautifully with a subjective p.o.v., I think that was simply too good. Again the concept of creator or metaphoric to god, was impressive.I think similar stage comes in everyones life where one feels that all this world is false and our existence doesn't matter to all out there, someway or other they are hear to earn (that)per day from us.

1031,ninagrant,A timely film with many legal truths inserted,9,27 May 2006,"The Truman Show has come at a time when cloning and identity theft are subjects which are so often raised. It is now that these subjects penetrate our every day lives involving us,not just fictional characters in movies. There have been many attempts by multinational corporations to 'register' a life form as intellectual property so they can do what they please with what is their 'property' and so the cloning world has begun. This would allow a child to be genetically altered for medical reasons (to avoid spina-bifida or another ailment) and in the process be registered as the corporations intellectual property. They can then 'use' that child throughout its life to harvest blood or tissue without any legal limitations. All pie-in-the-sky stuff but this has been an issue discussed by governments and pharmaceutical corporations all around the world for over a decade. I loved The Truman Show for its humour and skillful use of present-day technology. It was a late night viewing choice of this movie on TV or our latest version of Big Brother on another channel here in Britain, which made me realise how prescient this movie had been in 1998. The other coincidence is that of a book written years ago about a woman who was diagnosed as schizophrenic and had delusions that her whole life had been run by people called ""Operators"" and she was just their""Thing"" to be tested and manipulated for their amusement and curiosity. They revealed to her that Operators had been around since the dawn of Man and had constantly set tasks for their Things, which inadvertently caused Man to evolve. They said, ""If it hadn't been for us, you humans would still be bumping into each other in caves."" Her life was a series of struggles to break free from this observing and testing by the Operators. Christof could slip straight into the guise of Operator in The Truman Show for it was his setting of tasks and emotional tests that caused Truman to grow and mature in the way he did. A great movie on many levels but a good piece of entertainment too. Hollywood doing it the way it should.",The Truman Show
1032,rahulgupta_kota,Movie Review,9,7 August 2016,"The Truman's Show is a rare gem of the 90's. It is very different from the movies that we usually see. Normally in movies, actors know that they are acting while following a script. While technically, this movie may be called as one of them, but the story itself is dramatically ironic. The movie starts a bit slow and boring at first but gradually draws interest of the viewer after interval. In this movie, Jim Carrey playing as ""Truman Burbank"" oblivious of his star identity, lives a normal life in a confined set created by the producer of The Truman's Show. Right from the birth Truman finds himself in the artificial world with artificial people without realising that he is actually acting on 24*7 show broadcasted live featuring him as the star. His every action, every moment was recorded on camera. However, lately he falls in love with her mate Sylvia in college. Owing to love, she tries to aware Truman of the reality by taking him away to a far stretch of land not seen by camera. Was she able to unravel the truth? What about the troubles that you apprehend? Did she save him? I am not going to tell the entire story now. Just know that ""love triumphs all"" and watch the movie yourself.The film tries to discover convergence between reality vs drama and marvells at its attempt. Although I feel that a better plot with could have done justice with the overall concept of the movie. The movie yearns for lost comedy and songs. I recommend this movie to the audience because its one of a kind but with a disclaimer to be prepared to get bored for most of it.",The Truman Show

I liked a lot because the more you thought about it, the more meaning it could have, but it also made you laugh. At first I was really confused and it seemed pretty weird. As the movie went on the more things started clicking together. It was really well thought out. When you really watch it, you can see what they want to change. The message is still relevant, if not more now. The media is all around us, and sometimes it's hard to tell if they're real or not and if they're for us or against us. We need to break free from the lies of the media and live our own life. Irony was used many times. It was ironic when the creator, Christof, said that he guarded his privacy, and the other news caster said that it was understandable. They completely violate Truman's privacy by broadcasting his life to the whole entire world 24/7. It was ironic that the people who were cast to do certain jobs could not actually do those jobs in real life, which emphasized the point of just how fake his life really was. Hyperbole was also a main asset in the movie. They exaggerated everything in Truman's daily life by making it a bigger event. Ethos was used because you feel really bad for Truman. It makes you want to stop the media and directors too, which is the point of the whole movie. Overall, it was a great movie with a great message.",The Truman Show
1034,iisl,"Great Movie, Loved the Concept",8,10 September 2016,"In this movie, Truman Burbank, played by Jim Carrey, is living a fake life; however, this is ironic because he has no idea that it is fake. I thought this was a great idea for a movie, because he is living in a studio with hidden cameras everywhere and everyone around him are actors playing their role while Truman has no idea. The Truman Show has everyone around the world watching. Truman thinks he is a normal man living a normal life and he has no idea that he is being filmed. This film can be seen as a satire because they are targeting the falseness of modern entertainment. Truman simply lives his life but just like the popular TV shows, Survivor or Big Brother, everything on set is fake. Since the power of media is so strong, the audience of The Truman Show or a show like Survivor think that everything is real. This movie is trying to show us how fake modern entertainment can actually be but the power of the media makes us think it is real.

In reality, Truman is living in a large TV studio, and has been since birth. Everyone else knows this except for him. Tiny cameras are placed all around the town, filming his every move of every day. 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year, this footage is live streamed on TV as ""The Truman Show"". But what happens when Truman begins to notice that everything in his perfect town, is just a little bit too perfect, and a little bit too repetitive? The Truman Show, starring Jim Carrey, uses satirical elements to comment on actual society. Connotation is used throughout dialogue to inflict the fake and awkward feelings on the ""citizens"" of the town. The way they speak makes you feel annoyed with the situation instead of being in support of it like most characters in the movie. The movie targets Americans as a whole in a comedic and ironic way. Overall the movie comments on the way society is so attached to media, and that in some ways it completely controls American's lives.",The Truman Show

He lives on an island, where he's being constantly recorded and broadcasted at all times, and all of his loved ones are actually actors pretending to be friends and family. As you root for him to discover the truth and break free of his prison, you find yourself disgusted at the people who enjoy his show. Yet as you think about it, it's what everyone does with their reality TV shows. This movie was able to criticize the media, yet still keep the story somewhat light, by adding humorous bits throughout. Walking away from the film, I felt conflicted on whether or not it was funny or not, but isn't that the point of satire? To entertain, but also provoke thought. This movie perfectly achieved this. Overall, this movie was able to provide a gripping story as we try and see Truman escape from the only home he's ever known, but make us question ourselves, and what we prioritize in life. This is a movie that I would recommend for anyone who needs a laugh, or is looking for a little soul searching.",The Truman Show
1037,thay-30097,The Truman Show is amazing satire and fun to watch!,8,11 September 2016,"The Truman Show is a satirical movie that attacks the concept of reality TV as well as the media. The film begins with the seemingly average life of Truman Burbank but begins to make you as well as Truman question the reality of it all. It becomes clear that Truman's whole life is a TV show and has been watched by millions of viewers since the moment he was born. This satire appears to be attacking reality TV and how foolish it is. It seems to provide no purpose and the film constantly shows people all over spending their lives watching somebody else's. Although it exaggerates as the show is on 24/7 and no one is shown doing anything else, it even shows policemen who are continually ignoring their job to watch the Truman Show. Even though this movie came out in 1998, it also attacks the media we have today because it depicts Truman as someone who is caged, someone who has zero privacy and is unaware his entire life is always on display. Just as the media constantly follows celebrities and pries into their personal lives un-relentlessly. The creator of the show responds to a call from an angry viewer saying that what they've done to Truman is not right by telling her that Truman is free to leave at any time. In spite of this, every time Truman attempts escape he is stopped by measures that get more extreme each time, leading up to his car being set on fire and the producers' attempt to drown him. It makes it clear that they don't want Truman to leave but they didn't seem to care if he died, showing that producers of reality TV as well as the media do not care about who they are exploiting as long as they get a good story with lots of views. I feel that this movie was effective and fun to watch. Even if someone is to watch this without any thought to the satirical side of the movie, it would still be an enjoyable experience.",The Truman Show
1038,dtar-03458,Read the IMDb summary,10,11 September 2016,"The Truman Show is a great example of a well-executed satire. It is entertaining, has an interesting storyline/concept, and has a strong purpose behind it. The performances by all of the actors (Jim Carrey especially) only add to this already solid film. The first time I watched The Truman Show I was 12 years old. It instantly became one of my favorite movies, alongside Clueless, Forrest Gump, and the amazing Sixteen Candles. Since then, I have watched it probably 6 times, but it somehow never seems to get old or boring. And to be honest? When our English teacher made us watch this movie during our satire unit, I was extremely confused. Never had I considered that this movie was more than a cool concept with a hilarious actor. Now, maybe I was just not a very observant and/or an intelligent person at the age of 12, but I still couldn't understand why this was considered a satire.As we watched the movie in class, I begun to see it in a whole new light. I noticed things I hadn't noticed before, tried to dig deeper in order to find it's purpose, and most importantly tried to discover exactly why it had been given the title of ""satire"". After thinking about this long and hard, I came up with that the satirical purpose behind the movie was to show how the media controls us here in America. It uses inflation to exaggerate the situation Truman is in on the show, to help us recognize how controlling the media is not only in the movie, but in our own lives as well. While it may not necessarily use connotative word choice/language, it definitely evokes emotion in all of us as we feel sorry for Truman as he goes through life on a TV set. It uses dramatic irony because the audience knows that Truman's on a TV show before he does. I think that the movie targets less of the mainstream media, and more of the people sitting back and watching as our television sets and the internet take over our lives. We are taught to not take things at first glance for what they seemingly are and to always question the world around us. This can be related to the lies that both Fox and CNN tell us on the daily about politics and what's going on around the world. The people that blindly follow either news source no matter what they are saying are the true target of this movie. Now, of course our lives aren't being broadcast to the entire world, but similar to Truman some people's lives are being controlled by a TV station. And it's our job to discover the truth and get out. As Christof said, ""We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.""To sum things up, this movie is nothing short of a masterpiece. Learning the true purpose behind the movie has only made me like it more as I can appreciate the thought going into each line and scene to make it more than just ""entertaining."" I truly believe that this is a movie every person should see, even if they don't necessarily agree with the purpose, just because it is such a well thought out and brilliantly executed movie. If you are bored on a Friday night, or just want to see something that will really make you think instead of just mindless TV shows, please give this movie a try!",The Truman Show
1039,sans-94968,A brilliantly thoughtful movie,10,12 September 2016,"A transfixing mind-boggling production. Truman Burbank lives in picture-perfect Seahaven. Everything is seemingly immaculate. What he doesn't know is that every moment and aspect of his life is set up and being watched and scrutinized. His entire life is being documented on secret little cameras everywhere and on almost everyone he meets. His perfect world is a television show running 24/7 and being watched by billions. The connotative language throughout the deeper parts was absolutely moving. It made the watcher think about what it would be like for them if they were in that situation and feel horrible for Truman. The idea of media control is still in today's society. We are starting to see some debate over the way the media manipulates public opinion. It reflected perfectly how amoral and invasive our culture industry is becoming. At the time the movie was produced the world was just beginning to see reality television and today it's everywhere and has progressed so much from even the movie. It in under the assumption of being another hilarious Jim Carrey comedy but turned out to be a thought-provoking and rewarding film that it is. The inflation of the idea of the power abuse of the media was big. The morals and the point of the film wasn't overwhelmingly beaten into you. The final scene is a much anticipated glorious end to a great movie. Its nice to have a movie make you think rather than brainlessly watching another reality TV show.

1040,rden-59061,Satirical Aspects in the Truman Show,7,12 September 2016,"I believe that the Truman show was an effective satirical piece. A clear view as to what the satire is criticizing, a lasting impression on the watcher, and just enough light- heartedness that pulls the movie together. The clear purpose of the satire is to expose the seemingly wonderful and well meaning but unintentionally benevolent nature of the media. The movie shows how awful the fixation that the media carries with certain people can destroy their lives in the end. What's interesting, in a rather sad manner, is how relevant and accurate the movie is today, now more than ever. The movie shows the deflation of personal privacy, which now mimics how some reality TV shows are set up. The movie also shows the inflation of shared interest in television, which has been on the rise for a long time. The movie, while seemingly outdated, is still a scarily accurate representation of modern society.The reaction of Truman to realizing something is afoot is almost odd in this day and age. He grew up without access to reality television, so he's unused to how some people would crave the fame that came with his role. It is almost odd to think how different his reaction may have been, had he been given access to the world of television.Personally, I enjoyed the movie. The acting left something to be desired for me, but the writing and setting were very satisfactory. The plot was complex, but not to the point that it was not understandable.

Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is the ideal man living in an ideal world. He has a wonderful desk job, a perfect home in a perfect neighborhood. But it is almost too ideal, and Truman soon starts to figure this out. Truman is also the star of the longest running television show to date. 10,000 plus days on live television, to be exact. His perfect world is full of actors, and he lives inside a large dome. But he doesn't know it. Yet.The Truman Show provides a wonderful movie with fine details of satire, criticizing us for believing too much of what we hear in the media, and to avoid it because it is taking over our lives. Even though the movie was made in 1998, I believe it is even more relevant than it was back then, because now we have cell phones that keep us constantly connected. There are so many more controversial stories today, and because of that, you can't always believe what you hear.The Truman Show is, overall, a good movie that provides a good instructional satire. I would recommend this to anyone who wants something to watch something that they intend to learn from.",The Truman Show
1042,elam-24161,An Ingenious Satirical Movie!,10,12 September 2016,"The Truman Show is one of the most entertaining and addicting movies I've seen in long time! The idea behind the story is ingenious, and I love how thought out and elaborate the plot line is. The moral and tone of the story targets liars and judge mental people, as well as people who choose to sit back and watch things unfold rather than get involved. It also teaches us a very important lesson about not exploiting others for your own personal gain. This movie is a horatian satire, lots of laughs and a light-heartedness to it that makes viewers unable to look away. It uses many satirical devices to further the plot, such as inflation and loads of irony. Even though this movie is over a decade old, it can still resonate with today's audience because reality TV is more popular now than ever, and watching every second of somebody else's life has been a rather disappointing norm in our society. However, our love for reality TV bridges the gap between us and the Truman Show, and really connects with the young viewers of the world. It puts into perspective just how involved we are in the lives of people that we don't even know, and it shows that there are many pros and cons to being in the spotlight.",The Truman Show
1043,ghou,"Great humor, greater discussion",9,12 September 2016,"The Truman Show is a satirical film that represents the craze of ""reality"" television and the media's manipulation of society. Though the film was made over 18 years ago, it is still very relevant today. In a giant domed community, Truman Burbank is living a perfect life that revolves around him. There are cameras everywhere and everyone, including his loved ones, are actors. The only person who doesn't know his life is a television show is Truman. In our current society we are heavily influenced by media. Throughout the film you can draw many connections to the media's influence on our lives. The media influences what we believe and what we do with our lives. Perhaps we are all being controlled under a figurative dome which is being held up by the media. The Truman Show also targets ""reality"" television. As reality television continues to grow in popularity, (such as Keeping up with the Kardashians, The Real Housewives, Duck Dynasty, Jersey Shore) the movie attacks the connotation of ""reality"" in these shows. We believe that life can really be like what we see in television, even though life is far from what goes on in reality television.While I was young I had liked to think about the concept of what if my life was a television show. This made The Truman Show extremely enjoyable as it brought back those memories and truly showed this concept in action. The movie contains great humor along with a perfect example of dramatic irony, being that Truman is the only person that doesn't know his life is a reality TV show. Overall, the movie is very enjoyable as it has a dramatic plot full of humor and entertainment. However, this movie is far different than others as it requires far more thought about how society is being portrayed in the film.",The Truman Show
1044,hroh,Great movie with a deeper meaning,9,12 September 2016,"The Truman Show is a movie about Truman Burbank. Truman is an insurance salesman whose everyday life turns upside down when he figures out his life is a TV show. HIs whole life is broadcast ed 24/7, to billions of people who watch across the world. Truman lives in a dome in Hollywood, California constructed by creators for the purpose of the show. Everyone in his life is in on the show and are actors. Eventually Truman starts to figure out that his life is not as normal on the ""island"" of Seahaven as it seemed. His life instantly turns upside down as he becomes aware and he tries to find normalcy and get out of his life on the ""island"". Personally I feel like this satirical film was a good movie and something I would watch again. I especially appreciate the meaning and substance to this film. The purpose of the film is, to expose and display how the media in our society today controls and skews our perception of the world around us. The fact that a form of media was produced to portray this purpose about today's media is pure irony in itself. Throughout the film there was exaggeration of the way today's media sells and advertises products. All of the people in Truman's life would continuously exaggeratedly look into the camera and display various products. This displayed how we force products down people's throat and use every opportunity to exploit them. Also this is shown by the creators using everything in the show to make money off of Truman and his life. The whole idea for this film is inflation of the issue with media in our society. The writers of this movie exaggerate and make the problem huge using the plot of the film to prove and teach us that it is a big issue in our lives as consumers. An interesting quote from the movie is from the creator of The Truman Show, Christof, ""We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented. It's as simple as that"" (The Truman Show 1998). This I feel is the main purpose of the plot and really speaks to the audience of the film, which is the everyday consumer. This quote really spoke to me and I hope it speaks to you too. This quote really gets the point across that we need to be more skeptical of the information given by the media. Overall, I feel like The Truman Show is an extremely effective form of satire and I recommend you watch it for some laughs, and some new reasoning in your lives.",The Truman Show

As the story progresses the satire of the story becomes obvious. The satire of the Truman Show is the amount of manipulation that the media goes through in order to produce something for their audiences. The producers built an entire town for Truman, ruined lives, and psychologically scarred Truman with the ""death"" of his father. Another interesting point concerning the Truman Show is the way that nothing is truly fake, it's just manipulated. Most of the characters had genuine emotions concerning Truman, but they were fed their lines as to manipulate the scenes in the way that the producers wanted for it to go. The Truman Show also brings up the private vs. public life argument. Celebrities are often struggle long and hard for a private life. This causes damage to relationships for those celebrities. The Truman Show illustrates that with the fact that the television show is 24/7. Truman is watched while sleeping, while brushing his teeth, and while they do pan-away during restroom scenes we hope, one of the goals that the producers have is the first ever live conception. The Truman Show has many different satires targeting a wide range of topics surrounding the spectrum of media influence.",The Truman Show

Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is, for all intents and purposes, a normal man living a normal life. White picket fence, lovely wife, friendly neighborhood and all. Like every man with everything though, Truman starts to suspect that there's more to life than his simple desk job and white picket fences. The Truman Show is a masterful work that gracefully comments on various themes of life in a brilliant manner. These themes include existentialism, freedom of choice, and the power that media holds over human life. It's also worth noting how much the Truman Show reminded me personally of the Matrix. Both Neo and Truman are a sort of ""chosen one"" character type. Not only that but they're both given choices to stay in the fantasy, or to leave and see the world for what it really is. The comparisons can even be found in the sort of ""captors"" of the two. Both of their captors believe that they're doing them good by keeping them in a fantasy world where everything works.In all, I believe the Truman Show is definitely worth a watch and provides quite a lot of thoughts.",The Truman Show

It starts out with a jolly guy going about his day like it is perfect. He has the ""dream job"" of working behind a desk, he has the perfect wife, perfect house, perfect neighbors, everything. It quickly shows his fears which provides some foreshadowing. Within the first couple of minutes of the movie it makes it obvious that he does the same thing every day at the exact same time with the exact same people. This reason being he is the star of a 24/7 hit TV show. The thing is, he does not know this. He was adopted by a TV company at birth because he was an unwanted pregnancy. He is now twenty something years old who has been recorded his whole life. He lives in a town called Seahaven which is actually not a town at all, it is a huge down with tiny cameras everywhere. Not only does everyone know this TV is going on, but everyone is apart of it. His whole life has been planned out since birth, who he gets to be in love with, who his best friends are, who his family is, who he works with, everyone.

We go through the life of Truman Burbank, following him along oblivious to the fact that he is being watched by millions of people on a television show, and watch his conquest to find out what is going on around him. The creator of this TV show in an interview said, ""We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented"" as the explanation to why he hadn't sought out the truth before, and I think that speaks miles about what is going on in this show and the meaning in general. This movie shows that we as people should always try and question the world around us and always be adventurous and quizzical, because had Truman never tried to figure out the truth for the reasons he did, he could have gone his whole life in blissful ignorance in a world that wasn't what it seemed. This movie showed that ignorance is not bliss, and the truth is out there somewhere just waiting to be uncovered. After watching this movie you feel the need to question things more, and that shows that this was incredibly effective at doing what it did as a satire.",The Truman Show
1049,grya-62964,Thought Provoking Satire,10,12 September 2016,"The Truman Show is a thought provoking and satirical movie about the unrealistic expectations that the media puts into our lives. As a satire the movie completely inflates the ""perfection"" of a reality TV show, but hits hard on how you cannot compare your life to a show because it is not necessarily always true. Throughout the movie Truman slowly starts realizing that something isn't right. That life isn't supposed to be always perfect seeming and there had to be more outside of his little town that he could never seem to leave. Many of us sit at home and watch reality TV shows thinking that it is real life. That everything in the lives of the actors are perfect and we wonder why our lives aren't that way. But through the movie you start to understand the concept that behind the scenes may not be at all what you think it is. There is so much more going on behind the camera than what you see on the television screen. The movie uses connotation playing into the emotions of the audience members to help them sympathize with Truman. This helps the people viewing the movie to comprehend the harsh realities and connect to the theme and characters. In the end taking away the intended purpose of the movie. We see this in the world today through TV shows like Keeping Up With the Kardashians. On the screen they seem to have it made for them. They can travel anywhere, anytime, not have to worry about money and all of their problems may seem minimal or even humorous to the audience. But what we don't see is all of the behind the scenes. All of the real world family problems that happen or the fact that one or more may not want their lives broadcasted for the entire population to see. The Truman Show tries to expose these realities hoping to send a message to all viewers. The movie is very enjoyable while getting it's point across.",The Truman Show
1050,gkee-05315,The Truman Show - a Satire about Media,8,12 September 2016,"The Truman Show is an example of satire, and though the use of satire, it shows how media has affected our everyday lives, and has influenced us in ways that it probably shouldn't. In this movie, we follow the life of Truman Burbank- who lives in the community of Seahaven (which is actually a giant domed television studio). In Seahaven, Truman is the star. He is recorded, observed, and judged. Everyone else is actors- only Truman is real, and he doesn't know it. Right away you can link the Truman Show to what media does to us today. You can see the satirical tool inflation being used to get the point of the Truman Show across. The problem of being lied today in media is conveyed by making lies a much bigger issue in Truman's society. The ""dome"" that is Seahaven feeds Truman lies about his whole life- just as media does to us today. We don't know what to believe, just as Truman didn't know the truth about his life. Christof (the creator of Seahaven) put it best when he said: ""We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented. It's as simple as that."". And isn't it? People believe what they are told to believe, and this satire highlights that perfectly. The Truman Show also brings to light the issue of morality in the media- which takes place at the very end of the movie; when Truman finds out about his ""fake"" life, he asks Christof to explain. Christof states: ""There's no more truth out there than there is in the world I created for you. The same lies, the same deceit"". This can be compared to our society today. Just like Truman, we don't know what our beliefs are until we are forced to question them. I think that the Truman show is an effective satire that is able to pinpoint an issue that is still present in our society today. We are still looking for ways to solve this problem, but- In case we don't solve it, good afternoon, good evening, and goodnight!",The Truman Show
1051,skee-98751,"Relevant, Thoughtful, and Hilarious!",9,12 September 2016,"The Truman Show is hilariously heartwarming. Set in the '90's, it follow Truman Burbank, an unassuming, naive but friendly man who lives in Seahaven, a small town where everybody knows everybody- well, where everybody knows Truman. In reality, Truman is the center of a TV show that has followed him since he was born. The director, Christof, built a dome behind the Hollywood sign, and inside that dome is Seahaven. Actors were hired to be Truman's parents, teachers, and friends. In fact, everything around Truman is fake- but it's real to him. He has no idea that he is living in a bubble built solely around his life. In the real world, people can watch Truman 24/7, and are almost addicted to watching him through life. The movie begins with Truman is almost 30, and is just starting to realize that things may not be as they seem in his little village of Seahaven. Studio lights are falling from the sky, a pocket of rain appears just over him, and the malfunctioning radio in his car suddenly switches to a mysterious voice documenting his every move! This leads to an adventure of Truman trying to figure out where- and who he really is. Despite being a lighthearted film, the entire movie touches on more thoughtful themes: the safeness of home and how far one clings to it, the addictive nature of the media- the director even suggests that the world in which we live in is corrupt, and Truman is being granted a gift by being shut off from reality. The film is also a satire, meaning that it brings to light a folly in human nature in hopes that we can change it. The main problem that the Truman Show satirizes is the media. The people in the real world are obsessed with the Truman Show! Throughout the whole movie it gives us glimpses of the people watching it, and they don't seem to move their positions throughout the 72 hours of broadcast of the Truman Show! It's as if all they've been doing in their lives has been watching this show- ignoring everyday responsibilities and staying glued to the screen. It exaggerates people's dependency on TV shows, but in a way it shows us the truth. We binge watch TV series on Netflix, we watch our own reality TV shows, and believe that we know the person we're watching. The Truman show is almost ahead of it's time- and that's why it's still enjoyable and relative today.",The Truman Show

Although we know the internet isn't always true, there are still so many false things that we choose to believe. In this film the idea of a life of lies comes to life. From Truman Burbanks birth he was in a phony reality that he was lead to believe was real, and everyone he knew were actors that lied to him. Everyone around the world is watching Truman on television 24/7 through secret cameras, and wants him to eventually find his way out of the dome he is stuck inside. Whether you are young or old, this movie is ridiculous and funny while adding a deeper meaning that is hidden below the surface. Even if you are too young to understand what the movie is trying to make you feel or if you are just laughing at the silly things Truman does, it is definitely worth the watch.This movie was very well thought out, and kept you laughing as you were slowly coming to the conclusion of what is was really about. The satirical elements are very strong, and clever enough to make you think without coming right out and saying it. The movie does a good job of showing how the media wants us to believe that everything is perfect in the world. They want to put us in a dome like Truman, and not see what terrible things are really happening around us. In Burbank's life, everything around him just happens to work out exactly right. In this same way, society tries to make us think that everything is just fine and there are no problems in this world, when in reality we know there are. Whether you get the true meaning of the movie or not, The Truman Show is very entertaining and funny, while giving you an emotional connection to the characters throughout the movie.

1053,ssul-44648,"Great movie, very interesting subject matter, very thought provoking",8,12 September 2016,"The Truman Show is a perfect example of how an unusual topic can still make for a successful movie. Most popular 'blockbuster' type movies use generic plots about a bad guy who is stopped by a good guy, and these movies rarely address complex issues that permeate our society. The Truman Show, on the other hand, uses satirical techniques to make a powerful statement about the state of today's media on the whole. Throughout the movie, several examples are given to allude to the fact that Truman's entire life has all been manufactured for the entertainment of a worldwide audience, like the repetition that is seen across the movie, from beginning to end. Scenes from the beginning of the movie are repeated, almost shot for shot later in the film, and this really gives the viewer a sense of how synthetic the world he lives in is. Additionally, one line manages to find it's way into several key moments in the plot, with each delivery providing more and more meaning behind it as both the viewer and Truman gradually discover the truth. This sense of discovery that is felt as the conspiracy that has been hidden from Truman falls apart around him is, personally, an extremely interesting subject, and this aspect of the film may possibly be one of my favorite parts. In addition to the artificiality of the world that is seen, the idea that corporations can be considered people is explored as well. Christof casually mentions that The Truman Show was the first instance of a corporation legally adopting a child. Christof greatly understates the significance of that event, brushing it off as a mere byproduct of creating such a show.Lastly, the film is able to tie it all together with a questioning of the ethicality of the show. Be warned, however, this paragraph will contain spoilers for the final act of the movie. As Truman is sailing away from Seahaven, Christof demands that a great storm be created to stop Truman from discovering the truth. When he is questioned by the network executives, fearing that Christof might kill Truman, he justifies his actions by stating ""He was born in front of a live audience,"" implying that it's no different to let him die in front of a live audience. This shows us how Christof really sees Truman, as nothing more than part of the machine that is the Truman Show. Truman may be an important part of that machine, but the point is, Christof barely even considers that Truman is a human too.There are few movies like The Truman Show. Very rarely do movies really take the jump needed to kickstart the discussion on complex issues, but this movie was willing to do so. For this reason, The Truman Show is one of the most profound movies to achieve mainstream success in recent memory. Are there flaws, of course, but the overall meaning transcends the movie, which is why I give The Truman Show an 8/10.",The Truman Show
1054,gjoh-50385,Makes you think about your purpose in life.,9,13 September 2016,"The Truman Show was very enjoyable to watch. The show seemed to fulfill a very strong satirical purpose. The show evoked fear and made me feel sad, giving me the impression that it is Juvenalian satire. The show had great examples of purpose, acceptance of the status quo, and morality. First, the purpose of the show was to make the audience reconsider their opinions on capitalism, and our current society. Watching a large company sell someone's life makes one relate to their emotions. This gives the impression of a deep impact on the watcher's viewpoint, and helps them understand the intended impact. The viewer finds a relationship to Truman, and begin to root for him while watching the show. This is relating to the humans ethos, and deflating the worth of human life. Second, the show has a deeper message about humans as a race. Generally, humans accept what they know, and live with the status quo. The whole movie, all Truman knows is the life that he has been shown. He takes over 30 years to actually start reaching out, and desiring to find new things. The system dampered his desires to travel and adventure, but he eventually wanted to overcome. This tells us that we need to try and go beyond what we accept. The directed target seems to big businesses and media, yet seems to give direction to the audience as a whole, no matter if they are the target. Last, the show makes you question the morality of large businesses. As you watch all of the satirical elements, and mainly the inflation of a desire for success, the viewer begins to question what limit we should hold to capitalism. Where should morality be weighed against a human desire to win? The show was highly entertaining, and with the funny moments such as product placement, and ironic/ evident moments of control, the show always keeps the viewer interested.",The Truman Show

We soon learn, however, that Truman is the most famous man in the world, without even his knowledge. Truman lives on the sunny island of Seahaven, a man- made island rigged with cameras that are broadcasting live 24-7 to a TV audience. Every person in Truman's life is an actor paid to record him and to create good television. This movie seems to be a satiric commentary on several things, specifically the control and influence that the media has on our society. Throughout the movie there are various product placements and references to things the consumers of the show will see. It was also a satire over the treatment of zoo animals and prisoners, as well as the control the Government puts on our lives.

1056,wlay-81852,Very good!,9,13 September 2016,"I've seen The Truman Show a multitude of times, and each time it gets better. First watching it at a young age (Roughly 10 years old), I never picked up on much of the deeper meaning behind the film. The idea of someone's whole life being a television program was simply entertaining. Now, as an older viewer and with more experience in analyzing books and movies, I can really pick up on the satirical meaning behind the plot. Truman plays the star of a 24/7 television program. His entire life is broadcasted for all the world to see. He is raised to believe that there is no real reason to try and leave his perfect ""island"". Throughout the film, we watch as Truman tries time and time again to discover the truth behind his life, and as he attempts to escape. The struggle he experiences while trying to break free from the artificial world can be seen as a satirical message. The world is trying to oppress you, and although difficult, you can escape. This is supported by a statement made by the creator of the Truman show. He said, ""We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented. It's as simple as that"". Several other hidden messages (Ideas) appear throughout the film. All the actors who play roles in Truman's life, are indeed fake. Despite directly lying to a person whose life is immediately affected by that lie, the actors/actresses show no emotion for Truman. This is comparable to the lack of care society has for the majority of its citizens. Overall, The Truman Show is filled with subliminal messages and hidden meanings, all of which can be directly tied back to daily life.",The Truman Show
1057,tlow-34505,Truman Show Review,9,13 September 2016,"The Truman Show is a very good movie in my opinion, it shows good satirical elements while being very interesting to watch. The show constantly keeps you guessing and wondering what's going to happen next. The fact that it follows Truman's life without him knowing but then cuts to the other side of the camera where the TV show is being created makes it really interesting. Perhaps my favorite part is when Truman starts being ""unpredictable"" and the T.V. show producers have to scramble to fix it and make sure that Truman doesn't notice anything. Once Truman does start noticing stuff you almost feel excited/nervous for him because the movie really makes you feel like you're in there with him and figuring out the mystery for yourself. You definitely find yourself rooting for him to find his way out and it made me very much dislike the people behind the T.V. show who were trying to keep him in the show and oblivious to the entire world. Another aspect of the movie that I think the creators did well is adding in scenes now and then that showed other people outside of the dome in which Truman lives reacting to the show and experiences that Truman is having. Towards the end when Truman is faced with a decision on whether to leave the ""perfect world"" as said by the creator, or leave and go into the real world really puts the audience on edge because you really don't know what he will do. All in all The Truman Show is a very well made movie that keeps you entertained and on edge the entire time.",The Truman Show
1058,kvla,Review of and Satirical Techniques in The Truman Show,9,13 September 2016,"To quickly explain the movie for those who have not seen it or don't know the basic plot, Truman is a a huge celebrity on a TV show, unbeknownst to him. Everyone in his daily life, even his mom, wife, and best friend, are all actors on the show. Throughout the movie he begins picking up on clues like actors telling him ""it's a TV show"", the same actors walking around the block over and over again for no reason, and the fact that somehow, everyone seems to know what he's doing, where he's going, and stops him whenever Truman does something that's out of his ""character"". I personally thought that The Truman Show was a fantastic movie, for many reasons. I find it interesting that the movie is so unlike any other movie I've seen, for the movie itself almost appears to be The Truman Show. While it messes with your mind a little, it really makes you think about what true reality is. I also liked the overall theme of the movie, that we accept the reality that is given to us; it's an interesting concept that could be applied to our lives today, making it a great movie and theme for people even today.Not only did I like the movie for those reasons, but The Truman Show is also an excellent example of satirical techniques and devices. It's easy to identify dramatic irony in the beginning, as the audience knows that Truman is in a TV show while he does not. It's also ironic that the character Truman seems to have a sense of freedom, although he couldn't be more confined. The audience can also see deflation and inflation, two very important satire devices. Deflation is apparent through the demoralizing of human life in comparison to corporate success, and inflation is obvious through the exaggerated use of props (in once scene a forest fire is instantaneous, in the next there's a sudden meltdown at a nuclear plant, showing that the producers will do literally anything to stop Truman from leaving the island). I would highly suggest this movie for anyone that wants a fun and interesting movie to watch, or examples of satirical techniques in media. The Truman Show is, in my opinion, a great movie for anyone to watch, especially those who feel ""trapped in the world they're presented with"".",The Truman Show
1059,cswa-28074,Excellent movie,10,13 September 2016,"I recently watched The Truman Show in my ELA class during our satire unit. I was pleasantly surprised when the movie actually turned out to be good. Before watching I read the description and I had my doubts but those were quickly cast aside while watching Jim Carrey play the main character Truman so well. Jim's funny personality really drove home the humor in the movie. Serious scenes were expertly acted by all members of the cast and I found myself enjoying every minute of the film.The Truman Show included many satirical elements inside some of the funnier scenes in the movie. The film uses satire as a means to show the audience that forcing your own ideals on someone is not always a good idea. In the movie, the director tries to play god and run the life of Truman. Truman eventually finds out that his entire life is a lie and tries to escape. After Truman finds the exit of his artificial world, the director tries to convince Truman to stay by telling him that the world he has been living in is better than the real world but Truman decides to leave anyways. The message behind this is a strong one and the movie did a good job of getting it's message across.",The Truman Show
1060,tpar,The Truman Show as a Satire,9,13 September 2016,"The Truman Show is a great satirical piece. Staged within a giant dome, Truman lives his life alongside actors, and he is the only one that doesn't know he is star. During the video, he begins to figure out that his life is a lie. He ends up escaping in a boat, overcoming his fears, to find freedom. The Truman Show is a representation of the control media has over our lives. Wherever we go, we are surrounded by it. In the show, there are a couple of occurrences in which people try to alert Truman of the control the media has over him. In response, the character is removed and the media tries to destroy their credibility. Later on, Truman is able to avoid the cameras by covering some of the cameras and pretending to sleep creating a gateway to escape. The directors of the Truman Show (the movie, not the show) are able to create some sense of freedom, showing how escaping the prying eyes of the public and media allowed him to have his own liberties and control his life. Near the end of the movie, as Truman is trying to escape, Christof, the director with a God complex, tries to scare Truman into going back to the city and living a ""normal"" life. Instead, he chooses to die rather than living as a slave and continues on his path (but he survives). In one of his final lines, Truman says, ""You never had a camera in my head,"" in response to Christof stating that he knew Truman better than he did himself. The accuracy of how the media feels it is in control was brought to mind by the techniques used by the directors of the movie. Overall, the Truman Show is a great satirical piece, helping to bring its audience into the realization of the effect and control the media has over them.",The Truman Show

Everyone around Truman knows they are being filmed and knows that they are underneath this dome. Everythings to be going smoothly until one day when Truman finds a girl and it is love at first. She tells him the truth that everything is fake and everyone is pretending. She is then whisked away by her ""dad."" Her ""dad"" then mentions that they are moving to Fiji. Flash forward a few years and Truman is out of high school and questioning everything around him. He then suddenly wants to go to FIji and find this girl. When Truman tries to leave there is always something that stops him from going anywhere. This is of course where the producers of the show come into play and the question of whether the show is treating Truman like a human being. One second it is that all the flights are booked, the next is the traffic, and then there is a hazardous waste spillage on the road out of town and he is tackled and subdued back into his own personal house. The directors sit there and feed lines to all of the people around the place to make sure that Truman never goes anywhere. Bringing his father back from the dead. Whenever Truman decided that he really wanted to leave they cut the stream for the first time ever and made it so that no one would know what is going on behind the scenes. He was so determined to leave at the end of the story they have to almost kill him to keep him in the dome. In the end Truman is confronted by the director of this whole story and he is told the truth. He has a very important choice to make will he stay in the dome and continue entertaining or will he leave.",The Truman Show

1065,evatr,the Truman show film review,8,11 March 2017,"The Truman Show is an American comedy-drama film directed by Peter Weir in 1998, starring Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, a man whose life is transmitted 24/7 with a worldwide TV viewers audience. The camera techniques, the unique scenario and the themes it touches upon, makes this film to stand out from all the other films of its kind and make it one of my favorite films of the 20th century.Briefly, Truman has lived his life without knowing that he is starring in a reality show. He is observed by millions of watchers all day and night allowing Christof, the creator of the show, to manipulate him and create the conditions of life that he lives in. He is the creator of his fake life. Seahaven, the town in which he lives is fake, the people who pretend to be the citizens of the city are just actors and generally he lives in a fake life. In order for Truman to remain in his inertia of what is happening many people try to stop him from wondering and averting him from wanting to explore more. However at the end, when Truman is 30 years old, he realizes in what lie he has been living on and he tries to escape from this town.Some interesting things about this film are its camera techniques and its setting. To begin with, the point of view is primarily from Truman. However many's the time that we watch the film from the perspective of the viewers of the show and the producers. This enables us to understand how these people think and feel when they watch the movie, while on the other hand when we see it again through the eyes of Truman we realize how he perceives the world while he is unaware that he is the protagonist of a reality show. Some of the camera techniques the director, Peter Weir uses are the following:1)He places the cameras in strange positions, with many close-ups and by shouting through circular frames in order to show that the constant surveillance of Truman. There are cameras everywhere.2)In some scenes, the camera is at a medium (eye level) shot, which enables characters to look at the camera sometimes. Although generally eye contact in films is avoided, here it is used so as we can understand that everyone except Truman are aware of the existence of the cameras.Moreover, the lighting must be examined because it is controlled by the creator of the show. He decides when to change the time of the day and when to day night and the night day. He gives us the sense of him being the God and that's what his name impels us too ""Christof"". Christof's name derives from Christ, and it is one more evidence that he is the ""God"" of Truman. In order to emphasize the fact that he is the creator of Truman's life, Christof has low lighting on account of his deceitful character. Furthermore, the film embodies many important themes, such as the theme of advertising and the effect that media have on us. Consumerism is evident throughout the film either in a subtle or in a direct way through the product placement as an attempt to lure the consumers. Due to the fact that the show is broadcasting 24/7 they had to advertise products during the show and everyone is aware of the advertising except Truman. For example, one advertisement was for vegetable peelers. Through the use of advertisements, the director of the movie is able to criticize this tendency that companies have to advertise their products in the movies.The effect that the media have upon us is one of the main themes in the film. The viewers of the show become so obsessed and addicted to it that they seem to forget what the real word is, ending up idealizing real world situations, shaping their own individual meaning towards it. The audience thinks that the world in which Truman lives is the ideal and they are shocked by his choice to leave from Seaheaven. This dependency on the show and the control that the media have is illustrated through Meryl. Meryl is a main character and she says that ""There is no difference between private and public life. My life is the 'Truman Show'. The 'Truman Show' is a lifestyle, a noble lifestyle."" She and all the viewers forget the moral values and they do not think is wrong to keep Truman on the show. However Sylvia who appeared only a few times on the show says ""He's not a performer, he's a prisoner.. you're a liar and a manipulator and what you've done to Truman is sick."" Despite the media's and people's denial he continues to fight for the human rights and the end for the reality show.One quote from the movie that was thought-provoking, is when Christof, the creator of the show, says ""We accept the reality with which we are presented."" The way I interpret this quote is that directors and generally all the people who create a film, present us what they want, with their interpretations. Consequently, when we watch a film we have to bear in mind that everything is in the imagination of the creators of the film. We have to be aware of the devices used in order for an image for example not to influence us.Overall, I really enjoyed watching The Truman Show. The acting is very good from all the actors, especially the one who plays Truman because he managed to capture his feelings and act as an ordinary person unaware of his role in a reality. Furthermore, the directing was clever with the camera techniques. The themes the movie touched upon are contemporary and they appeal to a wide audience, making the movie more interesting. It is a movie that I highly recommend and I would definitely watch it again.",The Truman Show

This movie really tells us a lot about the culture that humans have created through television. And today we live a a work one step closer to something as truly scary as this movie was. A twitch.tv streamer Ludwig has been trapped in a currently month long live stream I'm sure if anyone sees this in the future you can look this up. I knew about the basic plot of this movie before today of course and after watching Ludwig's stream and now being able to compare it to this movie, I am truly horrified. To know that there are people out there willing to put up their lives like this, and they always have the choice to stop. How long before we have a Truman show of our own? A masterpiece of a movie. And a scary reality of what society could possibly be capable of.",The Truman Show

1069,channingsp,One of the most creative movies ever,10,30 October 2005,"The Truman Show is refreshingly creative and has a unique plot. Jim Carrey gives one of his best performances as he acts more serious than usual. I am not a fan of other Carrey movies, and do not appreciate his sense of humor the way most people do. But that aside I loved him in this movie. Parts of the Truman Show give you chills up the side, and you really get a feel for the characters involved. The scope of scenery and the dome the movie is shot in is magnificent. The movie is also logical in its design and one gets the feeling that this could really happen. I would describe this movie's genre as a light drama that has comedy, but not slapstick humor. One of my favorite movies of all time.",The Truman Show

Your neighbors, your family, your loved ones... everyone you ever knew were just actors, pretending to be people they are not. Well Truman Burbank not only imagined it, but also lived it. This is a hilarious movie, that will catch you from the first minute you watch it. Just be aware... once you start watching it, it will be difficult to stop.

1072,pste-47603,Satirical Components,8,8 September 2017,"There are many innuendos that can show that they are in a TV show, but Truman's the only one that doesn't know it like at the beginning where the wife has a small commercial for a new mower. It is a great example of a satire because it shows that people can be very blind to things happening around them if they don't want to believe something. When Lauren tells him that it's just a big show, he doesn't quite understand and tries to make sense of it by just thinking she must've been crazy. There is deflation when people are talking about how keeping Truman locked up in a giant studio his whole life isn't that bad, because he doesn't even know it. There is also a lot of irony in which everyone is watching him, but he doesn't even see any of the people he truly knows. The target of this satirical movie is people who will believe anything that a person says just because they have only known one thing their entire lives. The target can be someone who doesn't listen to anything else because they only know one thing and try to block everything else out because they don't want to know the truth. It is still significant to people today because it talks about how people can be so blind to people around them because they refuse to look for something deeper, or the actual truth as to who they are.",The Truman Show
1073,lbro-93643,"An Enjoyable, Entertaining, and Thought-Provoking Movie",8,9 September 2017,"Hollywood is many times known for making movie after movie in search of a profit. In doing so, some of the movies churned out often have overused and cliché ideas. The Truman Show is an example of what directors in the movie industry should strive for. The idea this movie is something that is unique and unseen before. Using satire and thought-provoking visions The Truman Show makes for an entertaining and enjoyable film. Jim Carrey, unsurprisingly, does amazingly in his role. While some may not realize it, it takes just as much talent to portray comedy as it does drama, and even more to switch between. Carrey's excellent acting helped to bring the film up another level, he has good comedic timing and performs the script very well. The script is another element of the movie which helps to add to its acclaimed status. It is written very well and uses satire in subtle ways throughout the entire film. The script helps to express the underlying themes of the immoral ways of the media, as well as the obsession with those in the public eye. While Hollywood is often known for repetitive remakes and sequels to once popular movies, The Truman Show is a definite exception. Those who see it will realize quickly it is evidently different from a typical Jim Carrey movie, those of which usually involve obvious and slapstick style comedy. The Truman Show instead uses dark humor, and multiple differing satirical tools to reveal the underlying messages that are portrayed in various ways throughout the entirety of the film. These sinister messages become even more alarming when the audience begins to realize their actual legal viability in todays world. The pursuit of reality is an important theme in The Truman Show. Today, reality shows are already becoming more and more popular, and they are multiplying at every opportunity. These television shows are meant to provide the viewers with a sense of 'realness' to their shows and make the subject matter seem ever more prevalent and important to the audience. It has been nineteen years since The Truman Show was released, and the underlying messages are only becoming more and more important as time goes on and the media becomes ever larger. The Truman Show is wonderful film, with many thought-provoking layers, with philosophy, comedy, and well-written satire. Overall I genuinely enjoyed it, and I would recommend that anyone who has the chance to should watch this film.",The Truman Show
1074,crog-89662,This review shows how The Truman Show shows satire,7,8 September 2017,"The Truman Show is a very clear picture of what a satirical film represents. This satirical film represents how crazy a ""reality"" television show can be or set out to be. The Truman Show was made quite a bit ago but, it is still very relevant to today. Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) lives in a community that is completely domed over. There is no leaving this community for Truman. Truman lives a life where everyone knows and revolves around him. Truman is not only a known person inside the domed community but also around the world. He is a star on a television show, The Truman Show, and he is the only one who has no idea about. There are over 3,000 cameras around town and everywhere that he goes. Every single individual in the dome are actors or actresses, even his family and close friends. The Truman Show is targeting what a lot of Americans are obsessed with, reality television. These include Keeping up with the Kardashians, Jersey Shore, Dance Moms, The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and many more. What we think we would be able to have from a ""reality"" show, since it is ""real life and daily lives"", we will never be able to have. It seems to be that these so called ""reality shows"" are now beginning to be staged and no where near the real life they actually live behind the cameras. The Truman Show is a real reality show. Truman has no idea he is no camera and lives life normally doing his normal daily activities. This movie is very enjoyable with the dramatic plot and humor put into it. Although this movie is enjoyable, it does require more thought about how the society works and how it is portrayed in the film.",The Truman Show
1075,tcoo-20326,Truman show it is about a man named Truman how has been on television his entire life without his knowledge.,7,9 September 2017,"The Truman show was an exciting and all together enjoyable experience that makes people question whether or not they are being watched by others or by a higher authority. For those who have never seen the Truman show it is about a man named Truman how has been on television broadcast his entire life without his knowledge. To add to the fact all his friends and loved ones are actors hired and payed to be his friend and family they are all scripted to like or dislike him. This movie uses irony exceptional well in the format of Blame by Praise. It is praising the use of surveillance technology to monitor people without their knowledge. Just like big brother not the reality TV show but the government surveillance, but it is real condemning surveillance of people against their knowledge. That is one of the reasons I liked this movie so much it had many different levels. The base level of funny humor and how that situation could never happen, but then it gets into levels where it makes you think about whether or not with the increasing technology it could real happen or if someone is already doing it. There are other meanings that are explored like that of free will and whether or not people want to make there own choices or to have them made for them. Or is ignorance bliss and the more knowledge you gain the more you become suspicious of the world and others. The Truman show is a great commentary on the nature of surveillance and what are humans really like without putting up a front.",The Truman Show

He has a supportive mother, a loving wife, a fun best friend, and a tragic backstory; his life is practically a television show, complete with product placement, too-enthusiastic actors, and the fact that, no matter how hard he tries, Truman can't leave his hometown. Eventually, he begins to realize exactly what's going on. Christof, a producer, comes up with the genius idea to create a reality show centering around Truman's staged, perfectly drama-filled life. Everybody in Seahaven is an actor, except for Truman. It takes him years to figure out what exactly is going on, but once he discovers the truth about his life, he begins trying to escape his utopia. This satirical film shines a light on the objectification that media stars are exposed to every single day. Truman's television show is broadcast 24 hours a day, 7 days a week every day since he was born. This is a direct hit at how celebrities are constantly being observed and analyzed by the general public. There is a clear audience being targeted by the making of this film, and it is, ironically enough, everybody watching the film. The movie is meant to show audiences just how detrimental their objectification of television and movie stars really is to the people in front of the camera. The film gets this message across extraordinarily well, many thanks to Jim Carrey, who has audiences both in the film and real life rooting for him to leave the world his producers created for him, and start making his own.",The Truman Show

Though the methods through which most people now receive media have changed, lots of people, especially kids, struggle with being pressured to change through media. In the film, Truman experiences what the creator of the show thinks is ""a perfect life"", though once Truman finds out about the T.V. show, he wants to be as far away from his old life as he can get. This film does a good job of exposing the illusion of perfection that people can create for themselves using media, social media specifically. As this was a problem more focused in the television and movie industry at the time of this film, today, social media has become the center of this issue. People can essentially create a brand new life for themselves through social media, and this film shows how carried away a person can get without even realizing the issue.

1078,fbur,The Truman Show is a satire that only gets better with time.,8,10 September 2017,"In a time of reality television and social media, we have become more entertained by real people rather than scripted stories. The amount of people who prefer the Kardashians to a scripted television program is growing by the day. This movie is something that has become more relatable and closer to reality as time has gone by. Truman is the first child to be adopted by a corporation. He lives in a safe bubble of a town called Seahaven. Every day in Seahaven is a day with predictable but comforting story lines that all have a clean and tidy ending. Truman lives an extremely cookie cutter life, the only catch is that none of it is real. Every step he takes is televised live to the world and everyone knows but him. His closest secrets, that are only to be shared with his mother, are broadcasted for an eager audience. Truman's family and friends are all casted and their words come from their earpieces. Every turn and twist has been perfectly manufactured to shape a planned storyline for his show. The idea is that he would be televised from his birth to his death, but what would happen if the wholesome and family friendly Truman became unpredictable? In The Truman Show, be ready to experience the humor of Truman's world and also the darker themes of satire about the entertainment industry. This tackles the issues of exploitation in television and shows the irony of viewing people in staged and outrageous situations as ""relatable"" and somehow ""normal."" I couldn't help but feel that I, a sucker for reality television, could be part of the problem. The horatian like absurdity of so many watching Truman do monotonous tasks as sleeping and brushing his teeth, made me reflect on what the message really was. As I lived through Truman's eyes I couldn't help but wonder, is it real life if I'm the only one really living it?",The Truman Show

I believe that this movie is awesome because it kind of gets you thinking about the world around you. For me I think about this movie quite often because, (potential spoiler alert if you don't know what this movie is about), what if the world around me is all staged and nothing is real. A quote from the movie struck me relatively hard, when the character of the show's creator, Christof, said ""We accept the reality of the world which we're presented"". This struck me because of how true it is, we go through our daily lives every day and do the same things over and over again, without questioning anything, and I think it is good to question things every once in a while. Enough of the philosophical stuff, the comedy in this movie is also great. It isn't a comedy movie but the humor is sprinkled in at the right places to create some comic relief. My favorite scene in the movie is when, (spoiler alert!), the very end when he denies Christof's offer to stay on the show and he uses his ""classic"" line, ""And in case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening, and good night"". Overall this is a great movie and would give it a 9/10.",The Truman Show
1080,ashleysudmann,"Takes a little while to get into, but after the climax, you won't want to stop watching!",6,10 September 2017,"In the Truman Show, we follow the life of Truman, someone who was adopted by a film corporation at birth and lives as the focus of the most famous reality TV show, without even knowing it. This show is on 24/7, following every little detail of Truman's life. His little town is all he knows, and for years, he is okay with it. Since he is the star of the show, he is the center of attention of the town. Eventually this fact sticks out to him; Truman starts to figure out that something isn't right and decides to do something about it. He tries to escape, but he encounters many obstacles keeping him on the TV show's island. This movie inflates the idea of how far we will go for our own pleasure. In the movie, the whole world knows about the TV show, that the main actor is being watched 24/7 without knowing it, and that his life is being controlled by the cast and directors, yet they do nothing about it. In fact, they don't want to do anything about it; they enjoy it. Truman has no privacy, but no one seems to care; it must be alright since they are getting entertainment out of it, right? The movie also uses irony to convince the audience of flaws in our society. When Truman is struggling in his life, he turns to his ""best friend"" who talks to him using the director's words spoken to him over his earpiece. One of the most ironic line in the movie, in my opinion, was when Truman's best friend turns to him during a serious conversation and says, ""The last thing I would ever do is lie to you,"". This is ironic, because of course as he says this, he is lying. He is trying to convince Truman that he is just thinking crazy thoughts and everything is normal, when he actually knows that the whole world is watching is life play out. The Truman Show really makes us reflect on our lives; how far do we go for our own pleasure? It uses many satirical elements to convince us of this flaw. At first, while watching the movie, we find it crazy and over-the-top at this world's crazy idea of reality TV.

1081,cwri-14967,Truman Show Review,10,10 September 2017,"The Truman Show is absolutely one of the most thoughtful, well-written movies of the twentieth century. The purpose of this satirical film is especially pertinent in modern times as television and reality shows have become a central part of pop culture. From Keeping Up With the Kardashians to Duck Dynasty, we all seem to have that one television program that we just can't get enough of. But are these ""reality"" television shows actually real? The Truman Show is an impactful Horatian satire as a result of the effective use of light-hearted humor and satirical tools such as a clear target and audience, irony, inflation, and deflation. While The Truman Show is a relatively cheerful movie that people of all ages can enjoy, it provides a lense through which modern people can analyze reality television and how it impacts our lives.To summarize, The Truman Show is an effective satire that dissects ""reality"" television. Like all movies that are successful in the box office, The Truman Show appeals to a vast audience. As people living in the twenty-first century, we can't seem to get through the day without Instagram stalking our favorite celebrity or tuning in to our favorite reality show. I believe that The Truman Show is a must-see movie because it propels deeper thinking about the workings of ""reality"" television and how it affects real people. In conclusion, The Truman Show is a brilliant film that conveys an important message about reality television through the use of humor, satirical techniques, and real-world connections.",The Truman Show
1082,mjoh-26969,"A review on the satirical movie, The Truman Show",8,11 September 2017,"The Truman Show, a satirical movie about a man who is very confused about his life, and what his purpose is, has several beneficial and specific messages to take from it. As Truman, the main character, goes throughout his repetitive day, he runs into situations that nag at him, and get him thinking about what he wants to do, and how he feels like he can't accomplish them. Christof, the T.V. show's producer in the movie, has convinced himself and those watching and working for him that he has done this all to benefit Truman, rather than holding him back from the world he could be apart of. The love story in this very complicated, because of a sort of forbidden love that Truman is in. His feelings for a woman cause him to have a mission to find her, by planning to go to Fiji, where he believes she is. His journey to find this woman brings him to discover many important things about his life.This story brings to attention a couple of messages, such as the fact that you need to be cautious of the things you're doing, and be aware of those who you put your trust in. Another message is that sometimes, it's more beneficial for those who you have custody over, if you let them go and do what they really want to do. The character, Christof, does not want Truman to leave the amazing life he's built for him. Truman, however, is ready to create a life of his own. I related this to the relationship many have with their parents, and how eventually it really will be time to start a life of your own. When people are ready, you should let them go. I really appreciated this message, and loved the different actors that helped bring the plot to life. The Truman Show does a great job at bringing humor into this problem, and making it an enjoyable film for a variety of ages.",The Truman Show
1083,este-00979,How The Truman Show shows satire.,8,11 September 2017,"A compelling, humorous and exhilarating film, The Truman Show by Peter Weir, describes the life of Truman Burbank. Truman lives what he thinks is a normal life but what he doesn't know is he is being watched by millions of people. This is dramatic irony because we know that Truman is on a TV show but he doesn't. In his day to day life of being a businessman, Truman is being filmed by numerous, strategically placed cameras, 24 hours every day. Inflation is shown because reality television is extremely exaggerated. Truman believes he is living a normal life so people see his real life and not anything fake. The target of The Truman Show is people that are involved in TV shows and appear fake for the sake of looking better than they are. He was born on camera and raised on the world's largest television set with cameras on him constantly and actors all around him, which he is unaware of. Through his ""wanna be"" crush and a series of crazy events, he begins to discover that his life may not be what he always thought it was. Innuendo is shown when the girl he is interested in tells him that he is on TV. This makes him question his life and want to discover what she really means. He goes on the adventure of his life where he is challenged by the masters and makers of the ""perfect"" world he belongs in. By facing his fears and showing incredible perseverance, Truman finally reaches the edge of the world he has lived in forever. Here he is required to make the decision of his life, should he leave everything he has ever known and jump into the real world, or should he stay in the comfortable and safe world that he is told he always belonged in.",The Truman Show
1084,spow-07667,"Interesting as a satire piece, not really a good movie plot-wise",6,11 September 2017,"As a satire this movie was decent, as a movie for pure entertainment purposes it had a weak plot and no real climax point. There were many places where satire was seen in this movie. The first satirical element we saw was irony when Truman agreed to take part in a job that he needed to take the ferry to get to, except he was prepared to go and then he did the exact opposite, walk off the pier and not go. This was a good example of dramatic irony. I think that the target of this satire is reality television. There are many similarities between the Truman Show and reality television such as, both give others insight on people's' lives through television and both are a little too invasive in the stars' life, especially the Truman Show because the people can watch Truman for 24 hours if they'd like to. Because the target of this satire is reality television it could be said that the Truman Show is merely an inflation of reality TV to show people the problems that are present in reality TV. The Truman show shows Truman as a baby and you get to see him grow up, most have been watching him his whole life, and in reality TV when there are child stars, like Kendall and Kylie Jenner (who have been on reality TV from a young age), the audience watches them grow up as well, the Truman Show just takes it to the extreme. Reality TV and the Truman show are also similar in the fact that they don't want the stars to leave, so they create obstacles. In reality TV the obstacle that most stars face when trying to get out of the limelight is media backlash/loss of fame. Both of these things can be very hard to face, that's why the star will continue to be a star and make their boss company money. The obstacle for Truman is that he is terrified of water. This fear was instilled in him by the producers of his show, made so that even if he wanted to leave he would be too scared because Seahaven is surrounded by water.",The Truman Show
1085,rmat-12411,Gret Movie,9,11 September 2017,"The movie 'The Truman Show' was a very enjoyable movie to watch. I really enjoyed the plot and the acting of Jim Carrey as he plays the main character Truman in the movie. I really liked how real they made the movie feel and how they didn't reveal the entire plot until about halfway through the movie. The whole point that the movie was trying to get across to people was a very good point that applies very well to our lives now with all of the advancements in technology and the large growth of social media. You can some what tell that this story is satirical because of how inflated the concept of the movie is but it is more of a horatian satire than a juvenalian because of the humor that occurs in the story and that there is no direct target that the movie goes after. There wasn't really any movies or television shows that this movie reminded me of because most of the other satirical shows and parodies are either juvenalian satires or just comedic parodies that don't really suggest change like 'The Truman Movie' does, I believe that this is why the movie won so many awards. In conclusion I really enjoyed watching 'The Truman Movie and I think it is a very good movie to watch because of how relevant it is in our world today.",The Truman Show
1086,sekl-70528,Wonderful satire,9,11 September 2017,"I felt the main target of this movie is modern entertainment. We are obsessed with ""reality"" TV and celebrity drama. The Truman Show was the ultimate reality TV show. The stereotypes in the movie made it more humorous. It is comical to a viewer that Truman is unaware of the cookie-cutter, stereotypical life he lives, as he has not been exposed to real culture, he lives only inside his bubble. There are many examples of sarcasm in The Truman Show. Truman himself is often sarcastic, for example when he is pretending to act normal. I do find it ironic that Hollywood made a movie about how obsessive and idolizing celebrities is so normalized in society, but they are the ones promoting that because it makes them money, just like Christof in The Truman Show. All in all, I believe The Truman Show to be an excellent piece of satire and a wonderful movie.",The Truman Show

It is both a comedy and a drama, so everyone can get something out of it no matter what they like. Although there is some language, most of the movie is pretty family friendly. It also has a great message about reality TV. One thing you should look out for though is that the ending scene is very intense and may give children nightmares. There is some profanity including the sh-- word, hell, and godd---. Although these are very few points in the film and I'm sure no child would pick it up.",The Truman Show
1088,lucyfretwell,Very Moving (really!),10,28 May 2006,"I only came across this film around 2004 so I am well behind the times but was extremely impressed.Really at a loss for words.But there was a point in the film that reminded me of an idea that was going the rounds when I was at University and people were smoking pot and dreaming of changing the world via CounterCulture.In fact 2 ideas came back:2 pictures I remember that seem to have cropped up in the film to opposite effect . The first (chronologically later) was in the French film ""L'an 01"" which was based on the idea of a sudden change of perspective and life reality that would supposedly take effect when people all around would suddenly just ""get it"" and everything would start from scratch ""from year One"" so to speak.By the way this film occurred around the time of the events in Cambodia and I sometimes wonder whether old Pol Pot was a fan of it as there were a lot of those bastards in Paris (Ho Chi Ming,Khomeini )etc Anyway the other thing I remember was a cartoon in a ""counterculture"" magazine and the idea was that the character would be living in the mundane ,regulated monochrome environment of society when he would suddenly make a contact with a fellow human being and hey presto! they would notice a little crack appear in the wall.Of course on closer inspection it is revealed that they can look through the crack and even go through it .On the other side of the crack the cartoonist has painted in the alternative view of the world -Lots of cows I seem to recall and rivers.Maybe you get the picture?! So when I see the bowsprit of Carey's boat pierce the edge of the ocean sky it reminds me of that image but in an opposite kind of a way. Its back to reality and not some kind of a pipe dream!",The Truman Show
1089,kwhitmore-27277,Best Psychological Thriller!,10,1 October 2017,"The Truman Show is one of the best psychological thrillers because of its concept, choice of actors, filming and script. As I watched this movie I was blown away by how interesting it actually was. I find psychology incredibly interesting so this movie was great to me. The entire concept of this movie is about a man, Truman, who has spent his whole life growing up on a ""movie set"". His parents aren't his real parents, his lovers aren't his real lovers and his house isn't his own house. Yet, he has no idea that these people around him are all actresses and he's living in a fake world. The real outside world is watching through hidden cameras placed everywhere on this movie set that he calls his life. His entire life, Truman is being watched 24/7 and the outside world watches him as a reality TV show. Every move he makes, every emotion he feels and everything he sees and experiences is purely for the outside world's entertainment. The reason he was placed in this fake world, purely for entertainment, was because he was chosen from an unwanted pregnancy. There were six unwanted pregnancies and he was the first born, so he was the first chosen by the corporation producing the Truman Show.I really enjoyed watching Jim Carrey play Truman because as Truman began to experience signs that he was living in this fake world, it kind of turned into comedy. I love watching Jim Carrey because he never fails to make people laugh. He's done a ton of comedies including Dumb and Dumber, Liar Liar, Bruce Almighty, Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas, and many others. Carrey accepted this role even though he was getting paid 12 million less than what he usually gets paid for films. I'm glad he did though because I can't imagine the movie with anyone other than him playing the face of Truman. Jim Carrey tends to do a lot of improvising on set, which is exactly what he did during this movie. He didn't agree with some of the parts of the scripts and he would change things he did and said last minute as they were filming. Obviously as I was watching this movie I couldn't help but notice how it was filmed. I really enjoyed how this film other than the fact that it takes a while to understand what is going on in the movie. Many people may get half way through the movie and finally come to the realization that his whole life is being filmed as a reality TV show. However, it's also really intriguing how it is filmed. It's filmed in the perspective of hidden cameras. The angles are different than ""normal"" movies and a corporation logo appears in the corner of the screen in most scenes of the movie. This really showed how he was being filmed without him knowing. It gave the movie more of a reality TV show feeling than a formal movie which makes situations that happen more shocking. The script is very well written in my opinion because it makes you feel every core emotion. You laugh, you feel sad for him, you get angry at how they treat him and you feel excited for him. As the movie starts out he has no idea he's being filmed, however as the movie goes on he begins to realize and pick up on peculiar things that are happening to him. Characters in the movie start to feel sorry for him and try and warn him that he's being played. He starts to pick up on all these clues and try to figure out how he can overcome his fear of the water to potentially escape. The only way out of this TV set is to escape past the water, but unfortunately for him he has developed a strong fear for water. When he was younger, his ""father"" died in the water so he's never tried to travel past it. This was their way of putting fear in his head so he would never want to escape this TV set if he ever found out about what was going on. He eventually has the courage to get through the water on a boat which leads him to the door to exit the TV set. This movie provided such a thrill factor that I haven't seen in many other movies before. Watching him experience his situations and get past them is exactly why I believe it is one of the best psychological thrillers that exists.",The Truman Show
1090,harrywednesday,prophetic,9,29 November 2017,the truman show really hit the nail on the head in terms of where our culture was headed. it's crazy that this came out in 1998 and it guessed that reality TV and social media and 24-7 self obsession would become the norm. jim carrey is fantastic in this and so is ed harris as the puppetmaster pulling the strings.,The Truman Show

It holds up really well but today's viewer must realize that this was made before ""reality TV"". The perception at the time of the making of this film (1998) is that people would hate to have cameras record their every waking and sleeping moment. How wrong that has turned out to be. Now my question is: why isn't Ed Harris' name in the credits?

The story is perfect, the cast is perfect, the score is amazing, the camera angles make you feel as though you're ""watching"" The Truman Show instead of a movie. As I say with many films, TV programs, and video games the true sign of greatness is: Can it stand the test of time?

In fact, Peter Weir's direction and the inspired casting of Jim Carrey alongside people like Ed Harris, brought a pathos-tinged magic to the screen that's rarely been seen since the likes of James Stewart. If you've not seen it then I urge you to do do, and if you have then get it down off the shelf and watch it again now. Better still, show it to someone you care about.

1096,nadidixit,The Truman Show and the Irony,8,20 June 2018,"Maybe the Truman Show poses a reality to all of us. Sometimes we are stuck on an island that we can't get out of. We are played on by people around us, we become an exhibit that they can look at and be entertained. As I watched the Truman Show, I realized that life isn't very different from what Truman had to deal with in the film. The movie brings to us a kind of an indisputable truth through a narrative that's without a question, impractical. The experience seemed so real to me-every bit of paranoia and fear on Jim Carrey's face seemed extremely familiar. It was like encountering a truth that you have always been aware of, but needs a rousing occasionally. It's not like a name that you know or a fact that you are aware of, it's something that you already know by virtue of feeling it-like breathing-you know you are in the rhythm at all times but you don't acknowledge it. Very rarely, movies hit me pretty hard: it could be just a scene or a piece of soundtrack so brilliantly coupled with a sequence that you no longer need words to make a connection or sometimes, it is the sheer power of the screenplay. The Truman Show hit me pretty hard, not only because of Carrey's amazing talent to bring out emotions so impeccably onscreen, but because the story seems so much in contradiction to reality, yet so close to everything that's real. For instance, there is a scene where Truman and Marlon sit next to each other and have a chat as they watch the sunset. Truman knows something is wrong. He knows he is being watched. The scene comes across as very intimate in the beginning, where both friends recount early childhood memories and Marlon tries to convince Truman that if everyone was in on it, then he'd have to be in on it too and that he'd never lie to his dear childhood friend, one that came closest to being ""a brother"". From Truman's perspective, there was probably nothing more beautiful at that moment, a friend telling him what he meant to him and that everything will be okay. It was a kind of a reassurance-a feeling of warmth in the dire state of confusion that Truman was in. But to the audience, there is nothing more sinister than Marlon listening to Christof, the creator of the show, on the other end, picking cues and delivering his dialogues-just doing his job. This particular scene struck me as being a brilliant portrayal of how relationships work in real life. Everything that we think is true-the love and trust- happens to be a just a perspective. We are all Truman, digging the warmth of friendship and familiarity while not being really aware of the voice of a Christof. We think we lead a life of our own, but we have so many people leading it for us. 
Towards the end, as Truman decides to step out through the exit door of his ""life"", Christof tells him that there is no more truth in the real world out there than there already is in the world that was created for him. I may come off as being rather cynical when I say this, but at that moment, it sounded right to me. Despite that, Jim Carrey walking out with a final bow in the iconic end scene made me happy. Maybe, sometimes, the choice can be ours. 
At one point, Christof says, ""We accept the reality of the world with which we are provided."" In the end, two security guards just switch the channel in search of a new exciting show. I am not a nihilist, but sometimes, pieces of art such as these make me wonder.",The Truman Show

'accepting the reality that is presented to us'.",8,29 January 2006,"The Truman Show I personally like Carrey, if simply for the reason that I've not seen any of his more off the wall stuff. My experience with him has been 'The Truman Show', 'The Mask', 'Bruce Almighty' and 'The Majestic'. The Truman Show is an astute commentary on our lives. Funny how we go through them, as the 'director' stated... 'accepting the reality that is presented to us'. Could it then be, that what we know and see isn't really what 'is' at all? From the heavens, many of us know of a 'God'... that watches over us, loving us unconditionally, on the pretense and within the world that he has 'created' for us. He believes with all his heart, that it is the best for us. Yet... What if... What if it is not the best? What if we do not want what we are given? What if we long for something else, something inexplicable that we can not even put in to words? It seems that questions are the very life blood that pumps through us. That, and an unconquerable spirit to have ever 'more' than we know. Is that why poets write, explorers leave and dreamers find another reality? Perhaps as we contemplate our own little 'worlds', we will pause now and again to question what we see, and what we believe we know... and maybe, just maybe... we will learn. In Bruce Almighty I asked my son what he had learned. He answered with, ""That we don't know everything"". I thought that was a pretty astute observation from a 13 year old who usually believes he does. He also commented on how it was best to think about why we want something.

1101,jasonlain-1,don't over analyze,1,16 February 2006,"""The Truman Show"" is a film in which Jim Carey plays the character Truman Burbank who is an insurance salesman that seems to want more out of life. He finds later that there is something strange about his surroundings that isn't authentic. There must be someone watching him because everything seems to be orchestrated.He goes on from this to the discovery this hypothesis is true and that there has to be more to the world than he has seen. He tries to escape his surroundings that he was groomed to be accustomed to, and finds that magically every attempt that he makes is unsuccessful because something always comes up as a block.This aspect of the movie portrays much of what one must imagine would happen in the raising of a wild animal in a controlled environment. They would either find that there is no way out of their environment and eventually give up, or they would rebel. This would be much like in ""Jurassic Park"", where the dinosaurs find a way out of the fence of the controlled environment. Truman is a wild animal that is kept in a controlled environment that is against his innate will and instinct. His instinct is to explore and find meaning to life. He is a wild man on the lose, and nothing can stop his aspiration to venture to the unknown. This is much the same in ""Jurassic Park"", in that the animals that once ruled the earth have an instinct of free range. They will, by their instinct, find ways to become top of the chain again.There are many that will find that the movie ""The Truman Show"" has some underlying spiritual meaning and that the producers had some great theological statement to make about how we view God and whatever else may come to mind. Many may even say that it is a statement of theodicy in that God has everything perfectly orchestrated to his will but makes mistakes in his outtakes. Others may say that much like what the Mormon church believes, God was just a man that was given high power of which he abused and screwed up thus bringing disorder to his creation.While all of these are legitimate statements about this movie, none are quite on par as much as to say that this was a movie for the sake of entertainment and poking fun at reality television. While reading many interviews of Weir, one will find that it was a satire on reality television and that it was to show how fake it was. It is almost as if it were to show the persons involved in reality television are pets that are subject to what the master throws at them. All of their responses are controlled and generated responses from a learned behavior in one way or other. These directors have simply learned how to manipulate those responses to get good ratings.Unfortunately, unlike ""Jurassic Park"", ""The Truman Show"" is not worth a sequel. The movie was poorly made and had a juvenile story line. The plot development was not adequate for the audience to fully connect with all of the characters. It was obvious that the prime focus was to give Jim Carey a character portfolio that would bring his career into a deeper, more meaningful position. While this being true, more than likely, this was the only way that a writer of a movie in this caliber could get his work published; one can find an actor with the need to diversify, come up with a budget, and create a film with a big name and it instantaneously happens, they have a career.For any person to say that this movie had any type of effect on them spiritually, would be to say that the ""Care Bears"" shaped their epistemology ultimately leading them to Jesus. There is about as much spiritual meaning to this movie as there is in a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and to say otherwise is to deny that of the words of the director and to read cosmetology into ""Gandhi"".",The Truman Show
1102,cbro-86961,Incredibly Done Juvenalian Satire,10,8 September 2018,"The Truman Show is an incredible portrayal of the crimes of media in our society. Through the life of Truman Burbank, the film depicts the harms of the commercialization of everything in our lives, sometimes even including our lives themselves. By portraying a man who has been literally trapped within the media for the entirety of his life, this film is able to satirically describe the metaphorical trapping of society through the media. The Truman Show uses well-placed humor to lighten its Juvenalian elements of darkness throughout the film, especially at the very end of the story. In addition, the cast does a phenomenal job of depicting the emotions of their various characters. Not only is this movie incredibly entertaining, but it also confronts real issues that are more prominent now than ever. With the exponential growth of influential media over the past decade, our society has grown more and more focused on the media. From social media to television shows, the public has become deeply committed to centralizing everything around the media, almost to the point that it has become their lives.
 In regards to satirical elements, there are many to be found in The Truman Show. The target of this film is clearly the media and its powerful influence of nearly everything. The audience is, quite literally, everyone with access to modern media, which is quite a few people. The most prominent satirical element in the movie is inflation; The Truman Show inflates the issue of a media takeover by making Truman Burbank's life actually revolve around media. This is a more exaggerated way of showing how the media has taken over our lives. However, perhaps the most powerful element used is deflation at the very end of the story. After Truman has escaped the television show of his life, the many viewers celebrate for a few moments, only to quickly go back to their regular lives, searching for yet another thing to watch. By showing how quickly the public turns its attention to something else, The Truman Show depicts the dangerously short attention span of society, with its main goal being to find entertainment. Overall, The Truman Show spectacularly uses Juvenalian satire to capture the attentions of viewers and show them real issues that can still be found in today's society, encouraging them to fix it.",The Truman Show
1103,ehoo-38217,The satirical elements of the Truman Show,8,9 September 2018,"The Truman show follows a man who was born into entertainment and his entire existence was for the purpose of entertaining the whole world. His twenty four-seven broadcasting lead the viewer into his everyday life for his entire life. I think the change this satire is trying to point out is the lengths people will go to, to provide entertainment and make money. I think this because the movie shows an over exaggeration of how we look at entertainment today. You can see this in the deflation of the fact that they have trapped this man in a dome for his entire life and no one thinks this is inhumane. The inflation of the perfect world and the safe environment that was created for Truman was a complete exaggeration because the world though it isn't completely perfect is not a horrible place. 
I think the creator is trying to comment on the lengths people will go to, to entertain the public and to make money by entertaining. The target would be people in the industry who exploit others to be successful and entertain the public. The audience on the other hand is anyone that participates in watching television or really anything that is meant to entertain. I think the writer's use of blame by praise was perfect for the purpose of this satire because by praising this attitude the viewer can now see what is wrong with this ideal. The connotation of the perfect life added to the overall theme of the satire because the movie was trying to create this world with no problems to make the viewer of the show think that keeping someone in a dome is okay. Without the use of these techniques the satire would have no been nearly as successful as it was.",The Truman Show
1104,acar-29279,Good satirical film,8,10 September 2018,"I think that The Truman Show is a satirical film, but it as not as obvious to see when watching. I think that the main purpose of this film is to show how much control the media and Hollywood has over the public, and how they can manipulate us by what they show. In the overall film it is ironic that they are sharing this message through a movie, because Hollywood is showing how controlling they are. Another example of irony is toward the end of the film when the director Christof decided to drown Truman to scare him, but made that world for him so that he would be protected from the outside world. This is significant in today's society as Hollywood and major companies try to shield the public from the truth with products and issues in the world, but overall it is hurting us.
I think that in the beginning of the movie, they used deflation to understate the issue because Truman was content with his life and didn't think much of it, whereas the audience watching the film thought it was odd that his life was being controlled and watched. One last element I think you can find in this film is blame by praise. This because in the film, the audience watches Truman's life and most show approval of having his life broadcasted for their entertainment. Though, the real intent through this is to criticize this type of action in our world. I think there are several target from this film, one being the people who are naive, especially youths, that don't understand that companies and politicians tell us lies. Another target could be toward those big companies and other Hollywood directors, to show them what they do to the public and how it is wrong.",The Truman Show

A lot of our society could still be considered the target, relating back to things such as reality television. The shows of even today are idyllic and display an improperly perfect version of our society. The same could be said for those who create video blogs, or vlogs, and videograph the best parts of their lives as if that is all of it.
It was almost aggravating to watch, considering how much I wanted Truman to realize the truth of his reality and speak out about it. It made me both sad and mad to watch the movie because of how it felt like a cruel joke against him to me. But, despite that, I really enjoyed the movie. The way the movie shows the reactions of those watching The Truman Show is a very good addition in my opinion.
The irony of the audience knowing that Truman's life is fake but him not knowing is the most essential part of the movie. Though it could have been shot entirely inside the set of Seahaven, with the audience realizing that it is a television show set along with or slightly before Truman, it would have been a far different movie than what it actually is and watches like. It is hard to say whether that lack of irony would improve the movie or not, as it is such a stark difference.",The Truman Show
1106,egen-83112,Most Creative Movie I've Seen in a Long Time,7,10 September 2018,"I think that the Truman Show is very much a satire, and a relevant one at that. The purpose of the film is to criticize the entertainment industry, and the lengths they will go to for ratings. It is meant to target the makers and producers of reality TV trying to make them realize the error of their ways, as well as the damage they can do with their platform. There are countless examples of of reality TV shows that have gone horribly wrong. As well as several times where individuals in the entertainment industry have snapped from the pressure that producers, directors, and even co-stars impose on them on a daily basis. The audience however is for everyone because we as viewers can also contribute to the problem by supporting the show, and making the producers feel like they have to exploit their actors for more views and better ratings.

After a while, I saw the same movie again and I figured out the hidden meanings and the real beauty in Truman's story (and I was indeed surprised). Actually, Truman's story is no different from our story. He was the essential piece in a big plan but didn't know it because he had no eyes for it.

Thats what I love about the film, it has a great story, it adds lots of suspense to the film where Truman starts finding out that he's in a fake world created by a master genius 'Christof'. My favourate part is where on the radio it starts saying everything he is doing and Truman is getting suspicious, it has great music at that part and puts suspense into the scene, I like the way that the creators of the show made 'Truman's' father fall into the storm when he was on the boat, because of that he doesn't like water, at the end of the film he escapes by going into a boat across the water, but no one looks for him there because he is scared of water, when they see him in the water christof trys to stop him with any means necessary, but in the end Truman escapes and I love the line at the end where Christof says 'say something, your on TV' to Truman and Truman replies 'If I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening and good night' and then he leaves, its great! It would have been better though if you could see what happens when he goes into the real world, but oh well its still a great film. The other funny part is where hes going mad in the car, hes spinning around the roundabout in the car and shouts 'Help me! Im being spontaneous!' I also love the way that he is in a perfect world created just for him, its nothing like the real world, Its great! I think that the Creators of the Film have done a fantastic job of making a Film with a great storyline and a new concept completely different than other films! Well done! Excellent work!",The Truman Show

1112,ruvinmadarang,Very Good show,10,24 February 2019,"The smartest, funniest, most original Hollywood movie in ages.It's pleasant, funny without being obviously so, and non-pushy. There's an amazing shot of Christof stroking an enormous television screen broadcasting an image of Truman asleep, as if he were God Himself reviewing his handiwork",The Truman Show

1116,donnyupang-07598,Pogey ako,8,1 March 2019,"As many fans know, Jim Carrey is the man when it comes to slapstick comedy. His comical physicality is outrageous and his ability to emulate anything from cartoons to other actors is top notch. But anytime before 1998 I think I can safely say that not many people saw Carrey try and jump out of his shell and try a role that wasn't truly in the comedy genre. I definitely didn't see it coming. And to be honest, I wasn't sure if I would really enjoy it. But in the end, I did, not only because of how well Carrey portrayed his character but with an excellent story to back if up.",The Truman Show
1117,amittagrace,Review of trumanshow,9,26 February 2019,"The truman show is one of the unique movie I watched . In this movie we can see the power of media over the life of humans were in it can control you . In this movie we can also see on how people use technologies or media to manipulate people, power and money.",The Truman Show
1118,rachelsoriano-76697,Rachel,9,2 March 2019,"I asked a friend to describe The Truman Show. He said, ""No, it's not a comedy, well...not exactly."" I didn't quite understand until I watched it myself. Truman takes on a tone quite different than any parody/comedies I've seen lately. The point (the media and its destructive powers) is subtlely relayed through dark humor, and you don't feel like the director is smashing you over the head with his morals. Peter Weir demonstrated his artistic genius in Dead Poets Society and here as well. The soundtrack is great, Ed Harris is stellar (what were they THINKING at the Academy?) and for once I actually liked Jim Carrey. His performance wasn't ribald for once. The final scene--I will not reveal it--is a majestic, long-awaited finish to an intellectual movie. Some people will insist that it was boring or pointless. Those are the same viewers who prefer slapstick, obvious humor to the subtle layers presented here. This is a thinking person's movie. If you can't see the underlying message here, of course you won't like it!",The Truman Show
