0,Leofwine_draca,Does its job too well,3,3 January 2021,"Probably one of the most nihilistic 'torture porn' movies out there, THE GIRL NEXT DOOR is made all the worse by the fact that it's based on a true story. It's the deeply disturbing account of a sadistic woman and the feral brood she raises to torture, rape and eventually kill an innocent young girl who comes into her care. The film is convincingly acted throughout, but it's the kind of picture that I hate watching, because I see no reason for such relentless sadism. There's no vindication here, no suspense, just one depraved scene piled on another until the ending eventually, thankfully arrives.",The Girl Next Door
1,SnoopyStyle,Disturbing,7,31 August 2015,"In the summer 1958, David Moran befriends Meg Loughlin who had just moved in next door. She and her crippled sister Susan from NYC lost their parents in the car accident. They are forced to live with their disturbed aunt Ruth Chandler (Blanche Baker) and her three sons. Ruth belittles the girls teaching her sons to abuse Meg. Soon the abuse turns to torture and rape as Ruth brings in the neighborhood kids. David tries to help Meg but he is a powerless boy.The story is beyond disturbing. It is more disturbing than even the worst torture porn generated by Hollywood. It is the use of children that is the most disturbing. The run-of-the-mill torture horror is something manufactured. It gets a scare and possibly a laugh. This movie disturbs the audience to their core. That's before I realize that it has a real life counterpart. The Sylvia Likens story sounds even worst. The pregnant daughter sounds just as scary as the mother. The movie does struggle to depict the torture in any acceptable way which is a tough proposition. Director Gregory Wilson doesn't bring much in terms of style. The lead kid is quite good but I'm not sure how any of the kids dealt with filming the torture.",The Girl Next Door
2,gavin6942,A Deeply Disturbing Tale of Truth,8,29 December 2007,"Meg Loughlin's parents are dead, causing her and her sister to live with their aunt Ruth. Ruth is not like the other parents: she allows the neighborhood children to smoke and drink, and has an intense dislike for Meg -- for no real reason. After telling the police about mistreatment, Meg's punishment becomes more and more severe.First, let me say that Blythe Auffarth (who plays Meg Loughlin) is an amazing actress. Some of the scenes in this film are truly awful -- not acted awful, mind you, but are just visually repellent. Most actresses would say no to the torture, rape and beatings contained in this film. And you cannot blame them. But Auffarth accepts the role and does an amazing job of being the normal ""girl next door"".While watching this film, I told myself I had finally found the spiritual successor to ""Last House on the Left"" and my opinion remains the same. Like ""Last House"", this film is scary because of its realism. The events could actually happen to the victim, it's not just a psycho with an ax (which, while possible, is more fantasy than anything). Perhaps this film even trumps ""Last House"" in a way because the events really did happen, and actually happened worse than depicted here. The real girl, for example, also had to consume human waste, which is not shown here.Making the film even more powerful is that we are shown the events from the point of view of the neighbor boy, who has a crush on Meg (despite being a few years younger). We watch them meet, become friends and then as events spin more and more out of control we see how completely helpless the boy is. While the boy is only mildly harmed in the film, it's an emotional roller coaster to be put in his shoes knowing everything that is happening and having nothing available to remedy it. The suffering he feels vicariously, we also feel vicariously. It's a pain train.I cannot recommend this film for the squeamish. I was very uneasy watching it, making this film a member of a very exclusive list (with such others as ""Kids""). Even those who enjoy seeing a film of slaughter (and sometimes I do) will be shocked in some way by this one. It's not your Jason or Freddy film, it's your sister or girlfriend really being kidnapped and there's nothing you can do about it. And yes, this really did happen and it can happen again.",The Girl Next Door
3,Woodyanders,"Brutal, shocking and unforgettable",9,15 December 2008,"1958. A quiet small town. Sensitive fifteen year old Meg Loughlin (a disarmingly sweet performance by Blythe Auffarth) and her crippled younger sister Susan (the excellent Madeline Taylor) are two orphaned girls who are taken care of by their stern and unhinged Aunt Ruth Chandler (superbly played with formidable steely grit by Blanche Baker) following the death of both their parents in a car accident. When Meg stands up to Ruth's harsh treatment of both herself and Susan, Ruth has her tied up in the basement and encourages a handful of local kids who include her own three sons and nice guy David Moran (a likable performance by Daniel Manche) to inflect all sorts of vicious abuse and torture on poor Meg. Director Gregory M. Wilson, working from an unsparingly grim and hard-hitting script by Daniel Farrands and Philip Nutman, offers a powerfully unsettling and provocative meditation on the destruction of innocence, the depraved wickedness lurking just underneath suburbia's well-manicured surface, the casual sadism of adolescence, and the horrors of strict discipline and rigid morality gone dangerously around the bend. Moreover, Wilson shows admirable restraint and suggests more than shows the various atrocities committed in the picture. It's this latter element of commendable tact and taste which gives this movie its extra unnerving edge. The uniformly terrific acting rates as another major asset: Baker delivers a positively chilling portrayal of serene evil as Ruth, Auffarth is both brave and heart-breaking as the unfortunate Meg, Moran likewise impresses as David, plus there are sound supporting contributions from Graham Patrick Martin as the mean Willie Chandler Jr., Catherine Mary Stewart as David's cheery mom, Grant Shaw as David's easygoing dad, and William Atherton as the regretful grown-up David. William M. Miller's fluid, sparkling cinematography, Ryan Shore's delicately melodic score, the nonexploitative and matter-of-fact handling of the unpleasant subject matter, and the frightening plausibility of the whole story further enhance the considerable jolting impact and potency of this profoundly disturbing and gut-wrenching descent into the cinematic abyss.",The Girl Next Door
4,rmax304823,Cruel To Be Kind.,6,15 February 2011,"It's difficult to give a film like this an overall rank. It's a reasonably well-done restaging of a shocking crime from the 1960s. A husbandless woman with the alluring name of Gertrude Baniszewski has a household full of her own children in Indiana but agrees to care for the two young daughters of a couple who are touring with a circus. Gertrude and her other children beat both foster daughters and then torture one to death in the cellar, using the most horrifying of methods. The incident is also shown in ""An American Crime,"" released the same year as this production.The reason it's hard to assess the quality of the movie is that the intentionality of the writers and director isn't clear. What is it that they are trying to accomplish? There must be a goal behind this effort; they must have had something in mind. If it was a moral fable, it's nicely executed. If it's torture pornography, it's disgusting.But it's not easy to tell which model it's following or, if it's a blend of both, the extent to which each model contributes to what we see on screen.William Atherton is billed first but has nothing to do except provide a couple of framing scenes as a brooding adult who had been a witness to events years earlier. In the closing scene, at his swimming pool, he maunders on about the ""gift"" the doomed girl had given him. What gift? There are, however, some neat characterizations and a couple of lines that resonate. Check the way that the mistress of the dark, called Ruth Chandler here, describes the freak show she used to go to -- full of jars with ""wiggly things."" Blanche Baker does a splendid job of incarnating the sadistic mother, as good as Catherine Keener's in ""An American Crime,"" and that's saying a lot because Catherine Keener can provide a truly polished performance. Yes, Blanche Baker does a fine job. She learned it all from me. I managed to teach the kid a lot when she was my supporting player in the haunting ""Raw Deal."" So, yes, it's pretty nicely turned out. The kids are just kids, except that Madeline Taylor as the younger of the two unfortunate orphans is better than that. Some kids seem to have a natural talent for playing roles. Some grow up to be actors, I suppose, and the rest become psychopaths.And yet, the movie isn't what it might be. The story is so gripping that the weaknesses glare like arc lights. For instance, the boy next door, a young innocent who witnesses the revolting goings on, is deeply disturbed by the torture he's forced to witness. So he goes to his Dad and asks if it's alright to hit a woman. It's a moronic question, in view of what he knows. And Dad provides a moronic answer: You shouldn't do it but sometimes a guy can't help whacking a woman. He delivers this with a complacent expression and a firm tone of voice. Why doesn't the morally sensitive young boy scream about the outrages next door where a young girl is being hung from the rafter by her wrists, burned with cigarettes, beaten by the foster mother, and gang banged by her own children and all the neighborhood boys she invites in? And -- another thing, small but signifying a dearth of imagination. The only people we see smoking are members of the evil family and, in particular, Ruth Chandler. She not only smokes, she smokes in every scene she's in -- and she smokes prominently. This is supposed to be in the 1960s and no one else smokes. Well, why not plaster a plaque on Ruth Chandler's forehead: ""Immoral Woman""? The audience is being treated as if they were as stupid as Dad.The structure of the story is faulty as well. Finally, the police invade this underground torture chamber where a young girl lies naked on bed spring and is dying. And what do the police do? They haul off Ruth Chandler and shoo all the other kids out of the dungeon, leaving the innocent boy alone with the dying girl, so she can choke out a few last words to him. The police don't even bother to make sure she's alive. It's an almost unbearable scene for more reasons than one.And I wish it had addressed some problems that are raised and left to dangle. Ruth Chandler is a sadistic nut. It happens. (The movie attributes it to her having been abused by men but that's bunkum.) She's the index case and can almost be dispensed with. But what about her own children, who eagerly took part in the torture? And the kids of the neighborhood, who kicked and beat the girl, and never told anyone in a position of authority? In some ways, those kids are more interesting than Ruth Chandler herself. One wonders what we are capable of when no one tells us that some things are wrong. Kids are in an unfortunate position. They're growing up in a land of authoritarian giants who pass on values that are not to be questioned.",The Girl Next Door
5,BA_Harrison,"As is so often the case in real-life, there is no happy ending to The Girl Next Door.",8,29 July 2016,"I'd read that The Girl Next Door was harsh viewing, and was fully expecting a film that delivered a barrage of explicit on-screen violence. What I got wasn't nearly as graphic as I had imagined, but thanks to its 'based on a true story' subject matter and impeccable performances all round, the film proved to be as soul-crushing, demoralising, utterly nasty, and incredibly sad as can be.Blythe Auffarth plays teenager Meg Loughlin, survivor of a terrible car crash that claimed the lives of her parents and which left her younger sister Susan (Madeline Taylor) seriously disabled. When the sisters are sent to live with their cousins in the country, they are subjected to mental and physical torture at the hands of their bitter and twisted Aunt Ruth (a thoroughly chilling performance from Blanche Baker), who encourages her sons and their friends to join in with the abuse. David (Daniel Manche), the boy next door who has befriended the older sister, is appalled by what he witnesses, but is unable to prevent poor Meg from being beaten, branded, raped and mutilated.A totally harrowing experience designed to leave you feeling numb inside, this is far from what could be described as an enjoyable film, but as a study of just how corrupt and evil people can be to a fellow human being, there are few that are more effective. Kudos to all involved in making such a powerful ode to the sickness inherent in mankind.",The Girl Next Door
6,paul_haakonsen,A brutal and disturbing movie...,7,7 November 2020,"I wasn't really sure what I was sitting down to watch as I sat down late in 2020 to watch the 2007 movie ""The Girl Next Door"" from writers Daniel Farrands and Philip Nutman. But on the count of never having seen the movie, of course I managed to find the time to sit down to watch it.And while ""The Girl Next Door"" is a rather slow paced movie, I have to say that you should endure and stick with it, because director Gregory Wilson definitely managed to slowly set up the story and build up the dread and suspense in the way that he directed the movie. So bear with the slow pacing of the narrative, because this movie turns out to be the kind of movie that will stick with you for some time and get under your skin - especially so since it was based around actual real events.The storyline told in ""The Girl Next Door"" is a rather brutal storyline actually. While the movie starts out slow and almost boring, it does build up in intensity and you get drawn in by the horrible events that take place, and it end up being cringeworthy to watch, and I know that ""The Girl Next Door"" was definitely getting an emotional reaction roused in me. I have to say that the contents of this movie is definitely not suited for just everyone in the audience; so viewer discretion is advisable. I found ""The Girl Next Door"" to be a movie that appalled me, but also at the same time brought some clarity to events of how deeply disturbed some people can be.The acting in the movie is good, and both Blythe Auffarth and Daniel Manche carried the movie quite well with their performances. And as much as I loathed the Ruth character, I have to say that actress Blanche Baker definitely put on a very memorable performance here. The movie also have familiar faces such as William Atherton and Grant Show on the cast list, in smaller roles though.If you are not the squeamish and easily disturbed type, then you should definitely take the time to sit down and watch ""The Girl Next Door"", if you find yourself with the chance to do so. While this movie is a disturbing movie, it is definitely one that has a story well-worth telling, especially if you have an interest in the human psyche.My rating of ""The Girl Next Door"" is a solid seven out of ten stars.",The Girl Next Door
7,michaelRokeefe,Sadistic and disturbing.,9,19 April 2012,"This movie will take awhile to get out of your mind. Based on the Jack Ketchum novel, a very depressed David Moran(William Atherton)thinks back about what he witnessed as a child(Daniel Manche)in New Jersey. The year was 1958, when young David met Meg Loughlin(Blythe Auffarth): she and her crippled younger sister Susan(Madeline Taylor)moved in with their Aunt Ruth(Blanche Baker), next door to David. The residents of the small community would be more than disturbed and shocked if they only knew what was going on at the hands of Ruth. Meg and her sister survived the accident that killed their parents...next was to survive Aunt Ruth, who would take Meg to the basement, tying her up to meter out unspeakable torture. David and the neighborhood children were commonly in the basement witnessing and even helping Ruth wield abuse and horrific tortures. The sadistic woman found pleasure in mentally and psychologically abusing Meg in front of the young audience...which included her little sister, who also did not escape Aunt Ruth's wrath. David did his best to stop what was going on in that basement; he himself was bound and left for abuse until he managed to get free and start a fire to alarm help. The sadistic torture and gruesome violence is very hard to watch. You don't actually find any joy in this movie, but find your own level of endurance. If you personally are in a depressed mood...or have survived physical and mental abuse avoid watching for fear of spiraling into a darker place. You will probably find yourself talking about THE GIRL NEXT DOOR just to vent. You won't forget easily. Even in its horrid and disturbing way, this is a cinematic masterwork.",The Girl Next Door
8,Hey_Sweden,"Both haunted and haunting; truly defines the word ""horror"".",9,2 March 2012,"""The Girl Next Door"" is the kind of film that one really couldn't consider ""entertaining"", but everything that it does, it does all too well. There is no horror, say, in a fantastical type of story, whether it be about vampires, werewolves, or aliens, that can compare with the horrors of real life, as author Jack Ketchum very well knows. It's films like this, that take us right out of our comfort zone by graphically illustrating genuine human cruelty and the suffering that results, that achieve the greatest impact. The story is told in flashback style by a grown man named David Moran (William Atherton), who will never be able to forget one summer of his youth, when as a kid (Daniel Manche) he made the acquaintance of new neighbourhood arrival Meg Loughlin (Blythe Auffarth). Unfortunately, the arrival of Meg and her sister sets off something in their strange, strange Aunt Ruth (Blanche Baker, in an unforgettable performance), who has a REAL problem with people of her own gender, seeing them as immoral and corrupting. Ruth gets it into her head to put Meg through a protracted series of physical and psychological tortures that her own sons and way too many of the neighbourhood kids are witness to, and willingly participate in. Therein lies another of the most disheartening themes of this movie, the complete shattering of childhood innocence. It would be IMPOSSIBLE to watch this movie and not feel something, and take pity on Meg; a horrified David knows just how wrong all of this is, but the viewer can grow understandably weary watching him fret but refrain from ever actually telling ANYBODY, including his parents (played by Catherine Mary Stewart and Grant Show). It's told in a very straightforward manner by screenwriters Daniel Farrands & Philip Nutman and director Gregory Wilson; there is absolutely no need for embellishment here and the filmmakers are careful to make much of the horrors implicit rather than explicit. It's bad enough to see what does make it onto the screen, as Ruth is determined to make certain this supposed bad girl won't ever be desired by men, and that she won't desire them herself. The inevitable ending almost comes as something of a relief. Wilson and company do take some time to sort of ease us into the disturbing and depressing main story by capturing an appealing look at childhood in an earlier time, but once the hammer falls, it falls with a vengeance and the characters will never be the same. The acting is all admirably sincere with Baker and the brave Auffarth creating very vivid portrayals. Far and away one of the most potent dramas that this viewer has seen in a long time, ""The Girl Next Door"" truly can be described as a devastating experience. Nine out of 10.",The Girl Next Door
9,LeonLouisRicci,Not Torture Porn...This is the Real Deal,8,15 September 2013,"This is not Entertainment. It is a consciousness raising display of Inhumanity. It takes place in a Fifties Neighborhood with bikes and tykes. A virtually unbearable escalation of torture images in all its forms. Sexual, Physical,and Psychological all done by a Mom in a June Cleaver dress Her Children and some local Brats all gleefully participating in the onslaught of the most personal of carnage.Let there be a warning if You are overly Empathetic or easily disturbed and the least bit sensitive, stay, nay run away from this Film. A quick glance at the Weekly Newscasts and even a cursory perusal of True Crime can give enough information to Enlighten you on the reality of this type of thing. There really is no need to see it Dramatized. This is not Torture Porn it is the Real Deal. A Movie so void of Hollywoodness that it might as well be a Documentary. The participation and victimization of Pre-Teens and Teenagers that goes on here is of a weight that is not easily lifted. The thoughts of this Evil will linger and invade your Mind and the result will be permanent. Like the Holocaust Images there may be a reluctant need for this sort of revelation for an occasional reminder that there is trouble in Paradise. But if you are acutely aware of that, no need to see this harsh realm as something as Entertainment. This is just too well done to be brushed off as anything but grand, grueling, but ultimately unwatchable cruelty that with its message is trying to be kind.",The Girl Next Door
10,lastliberal,"The past catches up to you, whether you like it or not. It can be a gift or a curse if you let it.",7,19 December 2009,"This film is based on a real-life murder case. Although I have seen this story before with Ellen Page, it was worth watching again. In fact, both this and the Page film An American Crime, came out the same year.This film lets you in the door easy. It starts with children playing, and it progresses gradually. Next we see the mom (Blanche Baker) providing her sons with beer and cigarettes, while talking about hoochie-coochie dancers.Mom raises the stakes while humiliating Meg (Blythe Auffarth) in front of her sons. Meg is in her Aunt's home because her parents died. It gets worse and worse.After she goes to the police, she is tied up naked in the basement.

11,view_and_review,My stomach is still in knots,6,29 November 2012,"I'll preface this comment with saying that I know that this movie is based upon a true story. Now, with that being said...Cinematically I can't really criticize the movie. I can't even begrudge the acting, in fact it was very good. The only reason I didn't give this movie a higher rating is because I'm American and Americans love happy endings. That's not to say that a movie can't be good without a happy ending, such as Thelma and Louise (that ending is a matter of perspective), but by-and-large we want happy endings. This movie, particularly, was screaming for justice and a turning of the tides. I know that it's not even realistic to expect a little boy to be a hero, but I've been so programmed that... yes I did expect him to be heroic at any moment. After a while David began annoying me. On the one hand he's repulsed by the actions but on the other he keeps going over there to watch AND SAY NOTHING?! I didn't grow up in the 50's and 60's so I'm not quite sure of the dynamic between children and adults back then, but during my childhood I couldn't fathom that. I mean, even if David was too weak to do anything, the very least he could have done was tell his parents.The movie just turned the pit of my stomach and made me cringe. But I guess that is the sign of a good movie and good acting.",The Girl Next Door
12,The_Void,"Raw, powerful and painful for the viewer",8,1 December 2008,"Films are made for a variety of different reasons but the best that cinema has to offer will invariably provoke an emotional response; and Gregory Wilson's film version of Jack Ketchum's The Girl Next Door is one of the best examples of a film to do that; and the emotional response that the film provoked in me was anger. The director forces his audience to watch a series of vile atrocities committed towards an innocent and undeserving party. The film made me want to reach into the screen and do something about it, and the fact that I couldn't makes this film one of the most gut-wrenching and unbearable movie watching experiences of my long movie watching 'career'. Mainstream Hollywood tends to specialise in searing emotional dramas designed to make its audience shed tears - but the fact that everything here is presented completely raw means that the audience is left to make their own minds up; which has apparently left some viewers unaffected - but it was what ultimately made the film so powerful for me.The film takes place in the fifties and we focus on David Moran; a young boy who meets a young girl named Meg Loughlin when she moves in next door with her sister after the death of their parents. Her presence incites the matriarch of the household; who takes it upon herself to use her sons (along with some other neighbourhood children) to torture and abuse Meg, while the case goes unreported. The first third of the movie is not too far removed from being a drama about a group of children in the summertime; but as the film moves on, things start to get dark pretty quickly and by then the film grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the credits role. The violence shown in the movie is not particularly explicit; and that's possibly why the film didn't get a rousing reception from some circles who were hoping for an exploitation flick. What we do see is more than enough, however, and it's the situation that really makes the film what it is. The acting is brilliant also; with the monstrous Blanche Baker heading up a cast of youngsters. Every film is looked at in different ways by different people; but I honestly am surprised that some people who saw this film were not affected by it. The Girl Next Door is surely one of the most unforgettable and painful films I've ever seen and for that reason I would give it a cautionary recommendation. It's well worth seeing...but you've been warned.",The Girl Next Door
13,HumanoidOfFlesh,Solid adaptation of a deeply disturbing Jack Ketchum's novel.,9,9 December 2007,"Whilst preparing to watch ""The Girl Next Door"" I was trying to lower my expectations because we all know that movies based on books are usually deceiving,especially when you are a fan of the book.It's obvious that Jack Ketchum's novel ""The Girl Next Door"" is far more disturbing and horrifying than this adaptation,but I think that it was impossible for the makers to capture the sheer power of Ketchum's work.Still the sad story of tortured and horribly abused Meg Loughlin is quite touching.Blanche Baker as the insane Ruth Chandler puts an amazing performance.She is a truly evil character.The film really goes as far as a more mainstream movie can go with its scenes of torture and domestic abuse.One scene in particular will probably make most of you ladies squirm.I have already mentioned Baker's terrifying performance but all of the actors deserve some praise.Usually kids in movies annoy the hell out of me but not this time.Give this film a look,but don't forget to read the book.Perhaps it's time to make a film adaptation of ""Lets Go Play at the Adams"" by Mendal Johnson,but I seriously doubt that it will happen.9 out of 10.",The Girl Next Door
14,KineticSeoul,Disturbing and yet engrossing,7,29 September 2010,"Now there is a 2004 film called ""The Girl Next Door"" and although that one is a comedy, this one is far from it. It's a serious film that is actually painful to watch, mainly cause of the beginning since you get to get in depth with some of the characters. The acting in this ain't great but it's passable, but the characters stick with you for a while. It really did make me sad at what I just watched, although the atmosphere really does seem like a horror film, which I thought was sort of a awkward approach for this. The film is based on a true story that took place in the 50's about two sisters that gets abused by their aunt, the aunt is a lunatic and goes ballistic on the girls while the younger kids just watch and some even join in. I felt bad for the sisters, especially Meg that gets most of the abuse, and the fact that it portrays her as a nice and kindhearted girl that just wants a decent place to live makes everything all more heartbreaking. There are torture scenes in this movie which is disturbing and yet engrossing to watch. The direction it went wasn't a great film making but it was still pretty good. I think the film should have focused more on Meg instead of some boy who is the only semi-nice person in the group that suffers from guilt.7.6/10",The Girl Next Door
15,bowmanblue,Sometimes 'horror' doesn't need the supernatural,7,29 January 2015,"'The Girl Next Door' is a pretty nasty little film. And it's not your 'traditional' horror film. These days 'horror' means either a guy in a mask stalking and murdering overly-sexed teens, or a ghost making a family's life hell in their home. However, here everything remains horribly real.And, to make matters worse, it's even based on real events. Normally, when a film is allegedly based on real events, it means that something might have inspired the film, but has been massively changed to make it more 'Hollywood.' However, here it looks like this pretty much happened the way it's portrayed here.Two young girls' parents die and they're forced to live with their aunt and her sons. Sadly for the girls, blood is definitely not thicker than water. The aunt is a complete psychopath and is seemingly happy to raise her children to be equally as horrible. Therefore, what follows is a story of abuse and torture. The two girls' one hope comes in another young boy who lives next door. He sees what's happening and – naturally – doesn't approve, but can and will he do something to save them? Because all but one – the aunt – of the actors and actresses in this film are basically kids, the production may suffer from a lack of professionalism. Sometimes kids in films just don't go and become annoying. Well, granted many of this woman's brood are very annoying (and downright psychotic) they play their nasty little parts very well. Of course if you don't have kids, this film may just put you off having them forever.The film starts and ends with an adult, basically looking back on the story he witnessed. I felt this aspect was kind of unnecessary and could have been left on the cutting room floor.Normally, with a film that I enjoyed, I'd definitely watch it again, if not sooner rather than later. However, despite seeing this film as actually quite good, I don't think it's the type I could sit through for a second time. It is horrible. No mistake. So, despite it being well-acted, horrific and generally good for what it is, I don't think I could go through it again.",The Girl Next Door
16,kenjha,Cheap and Exploitative,5,30 March 2013,"Orphaned teen-aged sisters suffer unspeakable abuse at the hands of their aunt and cousins. This cheap-looking film is based on the notorious case of Sylvia Likens in 1960s Indianapolis, which was better depicted in ""An American Crime,"" released just months before this one. This is more exploitative than that film, although neither can be regarded as a good film. The horrific story of child abuse is framed as a clumsily constructed and unnecessary flashback featuring one of the children involved in the events. The characters are so cartoon-like that it's hard to believe that the true events could have transpired as depicted here. Baker is strictly one-dimensional as the aunt from hell, and no clue is offered as to her evil behavior.",The Girl Next Door

18,jtindahouse,Sometimes the toughest films to watch are the most important,8,19 April 2017,"There are films out there like 'Saw' or 'Hostel' which set out to do little more than completely unease their audience. Strangely enough though, it is often films like 'The Girl Next Door' which actually achieve this to a greater extent, for the simple reason that they are more grounded and thus more realistic and plausible to those watching. Make no mistake, 'The Girl Next Door' is a very powerful film. It goes a lot further than I suspected it would simply from reading the synopsis. Also, the fact that I didn't know going in that this was a true story, and yet strongly suspected as much while watching (and turned out to be correct) also heavily implies this is a very well made and crafty film.Due to its power, this will not be a film for everybody to enjoy. I'm very experienced with these types of films, and I still found it a very tough watch at times. Considering the cast is mainly child actors (which can often be a bugbear of mine) I thought they performed very well. I can't think of a single member of the cast who gave a weak performance. This also very much helped to achieve what the film ultimately ended up being. I was very much impressed with 'The Girl Next Door' and if you think you have the stomach to handle watching it, I would recommend doing so.",The Girl Next Door
19,kevin_robbins,I can't say this is the greatest movie ever but it delivers the storyline well.,6,4 September 2021,"The Girl Next Door (2007) tells the true story from the 60s of two adopted sisters, one an early teen and one a handicapped little girl, who are abused by their caretaker. The caretaker decides to make an example of the oldest sister and invites neighborhood children into their home to rape and abuse her. One neighborhood kid feels what is happening is wrong but he doesn't know what to do about it. This movie is directed by Gregory Wilson (Clown) and stars William Atherton (Die Hard), Blythe Auffarth (Keeping the Faith), Blanche Baker (Sixteen Candles) and Graham Patrick Martin (Catch-22). The storyline for this was pretty uncomfortable. The children's acting is rough at times, but the premise is executed well. The mothers behavior was crazy, painfully gross and over the top messed up; some Misery type stuff, and the actress executes her character perfectly. I can't say this is the greatest movie ever but it delivers the storyline well. I'd score this a 6/10.",The Girl Next Door

22,TdSmth5,"Slow, surreal, striking",6,3 July 2016,"A bum is run over by a car. Some guy in a business suit gives him CPR for some reason and save his life somehow. The suit then tells us about pain and that nothing has been right in his life since the summer of '58. He pulls some painting out of an envelope.Now we're in 1958 when this guy, named David of course, was a kid. While at the river he runs into some older girl. They get along well. She tells him she lives with her aunt, Ruth, and sister, Susan, next door to him, after her parent died in a car accident.This was a time when doors were kept unlocked and kids just showed up in your living room. We meet some of the other teen and preteen kids in the neighborhood, mostly mean guys who don't treat girls well. They also play mean games. David and the girl, Meg, run into each other a couple more times and they start liking each other, even though David seems several years younger. David starts visiting Meg at Ruth's place. There are always a bunch of kids there. Ruth is single, and for some reason she offers these kids beer and cigarettes. She gives moralizing speeches aimed to belittle Meg and Susan. Susan is disabled, wears knee braces, and uses crutches, but that doesn't stop Ruth from violently disciplining her in front of the kids.One day Meg gives David a painting--the same painting from the intro. When Ruth finds out she interprets it as proof that Meg is a slut. After more abuse eventually Meg is bound in some torture position in the basement while Ruth and all the kids figure out how to make her suffer. They take her clothes off, start cutting her, burning her, eventually raping her. And things go downhill from there, while no one dares say a word and everyone except David participates enthusiastically.And that's what this movie is about--human inhumanity and cruelty--for the sake of cruelty. It's never clear what Ruth gains from all this, what her motivation is. Perhaps it's just the sorry need to feel superior and doing something because it can be done. I guess that's the common denominator in all torture whether in the 50s or today, allegedly for the sake of ""security."" More than horror torture porn, this is rather drama torture porn, it's not particularly explicit or visually gruesome. The movie is fairly slow and oddly enough the filmmakers don't bother to establish the character of Meg enough, which is why we can't really feel for her all that much until the very end.",The Girl Next Door
23,fertilecelluloid,Courageous adaptation of Ketchum's masterwork of horror,8,9 December 2007,"""The Girl Next Door', based on the great Jack Ketchum novel, has the pristine, sunny look of Rob Reiner's ""Stand By Me"" and the same flashback structure. It is a faithful adaptation of the book's events that is explicit at times (there is rear and frontal nudity of an under-aged female character and scenes of torture) and suggestive at other times. The ""girl"" of the title, Meg (Blythe Auffarth) becomes the victim of her Aunt Ruth (Blanche Baker), the domineering matriarch of a family of young, impressionable boys. At the hands of Ruth and the boys, Meg suffers terrible abuse. Sensitive neighbor and narrator David (Daniel Manche) becomes Meg's only hope as she falls deeper into the evil clutches of her tormentors. For a relatively mainstream movie, the catalog of atrocities served stone cold is impressive -- Meg is stripped, has obscenities burned into her belly, and has her vagina obliterated with a blow torch. Director Gregory Wilson handles the material with sensitivity and brings an uncluttered style to the narrative. Lensing by William H. Miller, which works as a slick counterpoint to the subject matter, is very effective. The narrow focus of the story causes the momentum to slacken around the two-thirds point, but this is a minor complaint. A more major complaint is that some of the film's production design (the cellar, in particular) looks too clean and theatrical to be convincing as a real place. Performances are strong across the board. ""The Girl Next Door"" succeeds in externalizing the horrors of a novel that worked beautifully because of its dark, internal heart. It's not a classic, but it is a courageous piece of cinema of the type that should be enthusiastically encouraged.",The Girl Next Door
24,Jonny_Numb,"""The Girl Next Door"" hits with the impact of a head-on collision",7,8 May 2008,"One of the problems I had with Jack Ketchum's strongly-recommended novel ""The Girl Next Door"" was its inability to alienate itself from the basement of genre pulp--granted, I sat through much of the novel with a knot in my stomach, and I ""got"" the author's transformation of a gang of neighborhood kids into one faceless mass, herded by Ruth Chandler--a sadistic matriarch in the throes of mental dissolution. But the sadism ultimately outweighed the humanity scratching beneath the surface, leaving me unsettled but also indifferent toward the novel as a whole. And the incessant metaphors pertaining to ""darkness"" and ""monsters"" grew repetitive and trite early on.So I approached Gregory Wilson's filmed adaptation with some skepticism, and a lot of curiosity (particularly in how the novel's subject matter could be distilled into an R-rated feature). While ""The Girl Next Door"" has its share of rough edges (both literally and aesthetically), it is a film that left me heartbroken and on the verge of tears by the end. It's a raw, brutal experience that also balances the scale of Humanity vs. Sadism that Ketchum could not.The most noticeable change (and, ultimately, probably most necessary for the medium) is the alteration of David Moran's (Daniel Manche) character into a more pure-hearted onlooker than a conscientious participant in the actual deeds that bring about the demise of Meg Loughlin (Blythe Auffarth). What screenwriters Daniel Farrands and Philip Nutman do, however, is make David ""just one of the boys""--filled with youthful innocence but also a morality that is kick-started (and accelerated) by his meeting with Meg. The tortures the girl suffers at the hands of Ruth Chandler (Blanche Baker) become all the more harrowing because of David's forced implication, but also his inability to outrun the syndicate of vile peer pressure employed by his friends.The second most noticeable change is the truncating of characterization (another necessary evil in adaptation), which ultimately leaves the rest of the neighborhood kids only vaguely defined. Yet for the film's purposes, this almost does a better job of presenting the ""faceless mob"" than Ketchum's prose.While the performances of the child actors can occasionally be overwrought, Manche is fantastic as the curious and conflicted David, showing a maturity that makes the third act all the more compelling; Auffrath is convincing and heartbreaking as Meg, a truly courageous performance. But the biggest standout is--quite appropriately--Baker's Ruth, who begins as a beautiful Donna Reed type, but slowly descends into a haggard, chain-smoking gargoyle, whose own internalized self-loathing has transformed Meg into a tableau for torture, leaving her mourning (with an always-blank stare) for an era that will never return. It's a strong performance of sinister subtleties.Additionally, the unflinching violence of the novel has been pared down, but is far from gone. Wilson manages to film the most repulsive acts with a tactful eye that makes them all the more chilling. If you're willing to make the emotional deposit ""The Girl Next Door"" requires, you'll be shaken, disturbed, and ultimately saddened by the events which transpire.",The Girl Next Door
25,Movie-ManDan,One Of The Few Movies You Truly Wished Never Happened.,7,8 December 2014,"I was at HMV when I saw a copy of this in a bin. Just by reading the back of it, I was hurt. Yet it captured my interest so much that I became obsessed with it. I did tons of research on the original case this is based from and watched the real version of this called An American Crime starring Ellen Page and Catherine Keener. Both are based on the 1965 murder of teenage girl, Sylvia Likens, who was was tortured to the extreme by her guardian and neighbourhood kids. While An American Crime misses many key points, is inaccurate, messy, and does not do justice at all, The Girl Next Door can get away with being inaccurate because it is based on a book by horror author, Jack Ketchum. This is way better than An American Crime, as this actually has a point to it. William Atherton plays a man named David who witnesses a bum being hit by a car and jumps in to save him. He then looks back to the summer of 1958 when he was a preteen when he failed to save a life. This is when the majority of the movie takes place and when the fictitious spin of Sylvia Likens takes place. Meg and Susan Loughlin are recent orphans who move into their distant Aunt Ruth's (Baker) house with her three sons. Over the course of weeks, David witnesses extreme torture to Meg by the entire neighbourhood. He wants to report it, but is scared what would happen if he did. When he does take matters into his own hands, the damage was done. Jack Ketchum chose to make it a first person story with the neighbour as the narrator as he was too disgusted to include some of the actual incidents. On the book, he includes about 85% of everything that was documented. He thought about having Meg survive in the story, but then thought that would be dishonourable. What's good about the movie is that it shows what kids can be faced with that's overwhelming and what happens when abuse is failed to be reported. What's good about the book is how much more things it includes. We go deeper into the mind of David, the beginning is actually funny and David taking matters into his own hands turns into more of a thriller. But both the movie and the book are very hard to watch and read. Yet, both very well-done and informative. But this may be the most depressing movie ever filmed.3/4",The Girl Next Door
26,begob,Not so hot,5,9 November 2014,"There's a very uncomfortable moment in this film, where I got a strong rush of claustrophobia as the girl was tied up and gagged. And then there's a nasty scene with a blowtorch, but nothing graphic.That's about it really.The framing of the story - a middle aged man looks back on his role in the torture - is a bit lame, with a clunky random road accident to foreshadow his reaction to his dilemma. There is great potential in Mrs Chandler, who was played well, but we weren't given much insight on her life and her household. There's a good scene where she lifts her skirts in front of the children and you sense something dangerous about her, but she ends up as a thin-lipped sadist with nothing of real interest. I was hoping for a female riff on Frank from Blue Velvet.The final conflict is also very lame, as the cops burst in just in time. The child acting isn't great either, although the victim was played well.",The Girl Next Door

28,ElijahCSkuggs,"Weak Acting, Made for TV feel, but faithful enough to the book.",6,5 December 2007,"If I was to say the movie was as good as the book I'd be a big fat liar. It's not a bad movie by any means but it just didn't feel like it did the trick. After I finished the book, I remember thinking that it was one of the most disturbing books I've read. But after watching the movie, the first thought I had was ""Meh"".As everyone probably already knows the story is based on Jack Ketchum's depressing and disturbing read by the same name, The Girl Next Door. I suppose the movie was played out in a faithful enough way, but how it felt is an entirely different story. I don't know about anyone else, but this really felt like a made-for-TV movie. And they could have easily made it so if they deleted a little nudity and took out the swear words. The acting in this flick is laughable at times, especially when you have the characters Meg and Davey alone together. Also the bully, what's his name....well, when he first entered the movie strutting along....now that was some cheesy acting. This really reminds me of how amazing the young actors were in Stand By Me. But anyways, during last 30 minutes or so the movie sticks with the disturbing nature of the book and goes from a really average movie, to an alright film. The movie moves at a pretty nice pace, but some scenes, like when Ruth is describing things to the kids, those seem a little lengthy sometimes. I only know a couple people that have seen this as well, and they happened to love it. It's pretty obvious that the acting in this film (besides the actress who played Ruth) is amateur at best, and with a movie with nothing but acting to drive it along, I'm surprised so many people are really enjoying it as much as they say. But whatever, besides the Made-for-TV feel and the weak acting, it stayed pretty faithful enough to the book, and that's a pretty rare thing. But this is another case where the book outshines the movie by a large margin. And if you have the choice watch the movie first, because that way the likelihood of being letdown is much lower.

29,MrGKB,"I'm sorry, but Stephen King ought to be slapped...",5,24 January 2011,"...silly for shilling for this over-rated miscarriage of a film. ""The first authentically shocking American film I've seen since 'Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer' over 20 years ago,"" Mr. King opines glowingly, and if that's not just off-the-cuff claptrap, then Mr. King hasn't seen too many ""shocking"" films, or is a damn poor judge of film in the first place. Given his own cinematic track record, my opinion tends toward the latter. It's either that, or he was actually referring to the quality of the storytelling, of which he may possibly be a better authority, because it's pretty second-rate stuff. My best guess is that he gave this crap a positive blurb because Jack Ketchum, who wrote the book the film is based upon, is a pal of his. I guarantee one thing: ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" is so far out of this film's league it isn't even worth discussing.King blurb to the side, ""The Girl Next Door"" would not only leave Syd Field shaking his head in dismay, it would have Ted Sturgeon mumbling from his grave, ""Told ya so."" It's the kind of film that makes M. Night Shamalayan's ""The Last Airbender"" an Oscar contender. The writers are essentially noobs, the director hadn't had a gig in six years (and by the evidence of this mess, isn't likely to get one for another six), the actors are mostly unknowns who aren't going to be highlighting this one on their resumes (and how at least second-stringers like William ""Die Hard"" Atherton and Catherine Mary ""Night of the Comet"" Stewart got dragged into this embarrassment is a mystery beyond the obvious paycheck), and did I mention how bad the script is? Why, yes, I did. The only redeeming aspects of the film would be the reasonably competent production values and the cinematography. Truthfully, the only real acting came from the young girl playing the victim (for whom I hope the role doesn't become an albatross around her neck). The young man playing the ostensible hero has apparently found some success on TV, but I hope his chops have improved, while the lady playing the villain was just plain awful and should stop before she kills any more box office potential. The rest of the cast...never mind, I don't want to speak ill of the desperately employed.Don't be fooled by the blurbs or the box, and certainly not by the inflated rating on this site. ""The Girl Next Door"" is junk, and badly misconceived junk at that. It gets a ""5"" from me strictly for its look; it really deserves less. I find it interesting that the current tally shows non-U.S. voters outnumbered the domestic cohort by more than 2-1, and am led to surmise that perhaps they simply enjoyed what they thought was a legitimate peek into the seamy dark side of this country's psyche. I worry that this reveals more of their seamy dark side than ours. And I'm absolutely stunned that females rated the film higher than the males did *across the demographic board*. Something is wrong there, something is very wrong.One last parting shot: the film boasts (as the source novel did) that it's ""based on a true story."" It is, but only loosely. Very loosely, and does almost no justice to the actual events whatsoever. Bear that in mind if you're foolish enough to waste your time watching this polished bolus of a film. There's a reason it didn't get a theatrical release. Good reason.",The Girl Next Door

Unfortunately even if you are prepared for what will happen it is still pretty shocking. The acting is generally pretty low rate though the two main young actors Blythe Auffarth as Meg and Daniel Manche as David are both excellent. This is not a film to enjoy unless you are some kind of sick sadist. It is grim and undeniably hard to watch and the fact it is based on a true story makes it even more shocking and it's a sad fact that things like this went on and still go on.You may ask why make a film like this. Well in my mind if these things are swept under the carpet then nothing changes. If films like this make even one person speak up about the abuse they have suffered in silence then that's a good thing.

The narrative is simple and engaging but the content and the scenes are very raw, hard hitting and causing furious emotions within you, which is a good thing for a movie. The hatred for the characters and the sense of hopelessness that we feel as a viewers tell us that the movie is well made, acted and directed. Of course the narrative is cruel, gruesome and intolerable at times, making us anxious and furious. So we can say the makers were successful in what they wanted the movie to be, or maybe the movie turned out to be more haunting than they had expected. Either way, it's a sad story.

It's been a while since I felt the urge to scream, pick up the computer screen and bash it to pieces. That was what I wanted to do to the characters of this film (except the one protagonist of course).If you've ever thought a person could be cruel, abusive, and plain down right evil - The Girl Next Door will teach you that you haven't seen anything yet. There's barely any blood, and still - I have never, ever been more shocked and disturbed over a film. I'm a grown man, and I had to continuously remind myself that it was just a film and not real. Watching this makes you wanna curl inside yourself and cry like a child, or scream and go on a rampage.This film is a proof that immense implication of violence always leaves a harder mark than graphic violence and gore. The script, the acting, the screenplay... all put together create a sick and traumatizing experience. The fact that this is based on a true story and real events - makes it even more shocking. Seriously, I need a hug right now.I will never recommend this film to anyone, except people who have emotional problems, feel numb and unable to experience emotions.

Truly, ""The Girl Next Door"" is as tawdry as its peek-a-boo title and poster art.First of all, the plot device of David (and that's all he is) is pointless and manipulative. There's no need for this character to be in this story except to make you squirm and feel implicit guilt (you're watching it too...deep!). Secondly, the acting is marginal and clichéd. Thirdly, and worst, is the ridiculously fast progression to the torture and rape scenes which linger to the point of being fetishistic.The way this rendition plays out (no pun intended) is the very definition of snuff: the killing of someone to derive a sexual response.

39,doug_park2001,Why oh why didn't David tell someone. . .?,8,28 June 2013,"Expertly acted and filmed, THE GIRL NEXT DOOR is profoundly disturbing and downright sickening yet very hard to tear one's self away from. It is at least loosely based upon a true story, related in this book: ""House of Evil: The Indiana Torture Slaying,"" by John Dean. This story is, of course, about the abuse and torture of a teenage girl at the hands of her own custodial aunt and cousins. It pulls no punches in what it shows, which, along with the torture scenes, includes some rather gratuitous adolescent nudity.The character of ""Auntie Ruth"" Chandler develops very effectively from what appears to be simply a bitter yet coarsely fun and tomboyish divorcée to something much darker. The various child characters of the ""innocent, carefree"" 1950s are especially great insofar as both acting and general characterization are concerned. While there are no ghosts, zombies, or vampires here, the human monsters are far more frightening than those in any supernatural horror film.There are a few big stretches; e.g., Wouldn't a 10-year-old boy get pretty drunk, and perhaps quite sick, after drinking two or three cans of beer, and wouldn't it eventually become obvious where he was getting it? Still, the stark realism of this film makes its more hard-to-buy qualities forgivable.As others have noted, THE GIRL NEXT DOOR requires a very strong stomach from its audience, but if you want to see something truly horrifying, I recommend it without reservation.Based upon Jack Ketchum's novel of the same title. Frankly, I don't think the original novel--a bit lacking in character development and marred by a rather intrusive, sensationalistic writing style--is anywhere near as good as its film version.",The Girl Next Door

41,flicklover,Truly horrifying.....,9,16 April 2021,"I don't remember this film coming out in 2007. I don't know if it was released in theaters but I had never come across it until today.It is considered a horror film so I thought when I read that it was disturbing that I was expecting the typical mid 2000's torture porn film full of blood and gore. I.knew that it was about a teenage girl that was murdered in1958. This film is based on a true story.All I can say is that this film is one of the most disturbing and angering films I've seen in a long time. The film is narrated by William Atherton. It starts in present day with his character named David remembering his teenage years. David has a crush on a girl named Meg that lives next door. Meg and her disabled sister Susan lost their parents in a car accident and live with their Aunt Ruth and her 3 sons. Ruth let's her son's drink beer and smoke cigarettes but treats Meg horribly. Calls her fat and starves her while calling her horrible names in front of tge other kids. The kids get brought into the bullying. David is friends with Ruth's kid's but befriends and gets a crush on Meg. When one of her kids inappropriately touches Meg, she hits him. Ruth punishes Meg by beating her sister as punishment. Meg reports yhe abuse to the police. Ruth then punishes Meg by taking her to the basement and hanging her by her hands with the help of her sons. They strip, cut and torment, Meg. Ruth's son's are all in on this. They even invite other kids to play their sick game. David also witnesses this, but is too scared to say anything. David wants to.help. Meg but us terrified to tell his parents. He pleads with Meg to escape but when she tries she gets caught. Ruth has her son rape Meg as punishment and they make David watch. Ruth then proceeds to have one her sons carve words on Meg's abdomen with a hot Bobby pin. It is a mark that would make no man want her says Ruth. Ruth then burns Meg in her private parts with a blowtorch as she screams in agony. David is tied up through all of this. Later, he is able to free himsrlf and tells Meg they are going to escape. He starts a fire and when Ruth comes down to tge basement he attacks her and she dies. Meg thanks David for taking care of her and dies from her injuries.Thus film is as disturbing as any I have seen in a long time but it never feels exploitative. There is no blood or gore. Most of the torture inflicted on Meg is presented with sensationalist gore effects but are harrowing just the same. This film proves that heavy blood and gore isn't necessary to make a story disturbing. Ruth is played by Blanche Baker in a performance that is so good tgat I think she is one of the most despicable characters I've seen in a film. Meg is played by Blythe Auffarth in a heartbreaking, agonizing performance. The one performance that is a little weak is Daniel Manche as David. He has a tough.role, he hates what is happening to Meg but decides to shut his mouth. His indecision is a title unconvincing but the rest of the performances are so strong that it doesn't hurt the film. Tjis is truly one of the most harrowing, disturbing films I've ever seen. That it us based on a true story makes it even more disturbing.Grade: B+",The Girl Next Door
42,sreeragmeppadath,DEPRESSED,4,6 March 2019,"I'm not against gore movies.I love watching violent ones but not this.I understand that this was a true event and it's based on book but why did they direct the movie this way?
Such a topic would probably disturb the viewers but it's really more than sadistic to market torture on child artists.I prefer everyone not to watch the movie.No wonder why metascore is just 28.",The Girl Next Door
43,youngcollind,"Fascinating story, mishandled execution",5,27 August 2021,"With the true backstory being as interesting and disturbing as it is, it really calls into question why this film took so many creative liberties with the facts, when for the most part, a more biographical approach would have been more effective. While it did have some good qualities; the Steven King-esque prologue of innocence before it was lost offers a nice contrast to the oncoming depravity, and Blanche Baker delivers an intriguing, original villain with her turn as Buffalo Bill by way of June Cleaver. What gets me most is the introduction of David, the protagonist, meant to represent the moral good, but who's pathological ineptitude at solving the problem by alerting an authority is never properly explained or justified by the film. There are also other elements that come off unrealistic, which is a weird grievance to have with a true story. The characters are portrayed as such Hollywood monsters, without an adequate backstory to offer insight into how they became what they are. This makes the proceedings feel more like a tasteless exhibition of violence than an insightful look into this vicious crime.",The Girl Next Door
44,Tcarts76,Disturbing. I almost couldn't rate this movie,8,29 October 2012,"""The Girl Next Door,"" is a disturbing and unsettling movie to say the least. It is the story of a boy that witnesses the cruel and senseless torture of a neighbor girl at the hands of her horrible Aunt and cousins whom she and her sister was sent to live with after the death of her parents.As far as the technical aspect of this film are concerned (acting, writing, editing, etc.) this movie ranks about a 6 out of 10. The acting is OK, and there are a few good performance, but nothing that is going to make you cheer anyone on for an award. I do however give a lot of credit to Blanche Chandler for having the courage to take on the role of the morally repugnant Aunt in this movie. It's a role that could possible hurt her if you ever see her in a movie again due to the nature of her character in this movie. It is the kind of role that is hard to shake off, much like Mark Harmon suffered for a few years when people had a hard time shaking of his performance as Ted Bundy in ,""The Deliberate Stranger.""Technically it rates a 6, and I truly had a hard time rating it beyond that. I finally settled for an overall 8 out of ten. Why? Because this movie does what it intended to do. It makes the emotions of the audience come to the surface in a guttural way. There is no liking most of the characters, and it is a hard movie to watch and even harder to like. I don't give it an 8 because I liked it, I give it that because it elicits such a strong response. It makes you feel uncomfortable and want to look away. It at least deserves a lot of credit for that.That being said there are a lot of people I think should not watch this movie. Of course no child should watch it. If you are emotionally sensitive, or squeamish, do not watch this movie. If you have children, especially a daughter, do not watch this movie. If you and your girlfriend, or wife, like horror movies, this is still not a ""date night,"" movie. In Fact, after seeing this movie I feel that I would be uncomfortable watching this movie with most anyone in the same room, especially women. So be cautious if you are interested to watch this one. It can be praised as a good all around film but the subject matter is very difficult to watch. It's the kind of movie that you will watch even if at times you want to fast forward or look away, in hopes the cavalry will be coming through the door at any moment. You will pray that it comes to an end and there will be a sense of justice, leaving you with a feel good silver lining and fairytale happily ever after moment. You will just have to watch it to find out if that is the case.Like my reviews, hate em? Questions, comments, or want a DVD reviewed?

45,pivic,It's a b-movie: bad direction despite much material,2,30 May 2010,"A story loosely based on the much-too-short life of Sylvia Likens, this film mainly portrays a couple of characters (an adult and a child) in regards to the explicit and horrendous torture of a child, both by the care-taker, her biological children and their friends. And their neighbours cared naught. It's based on the story of Sylvia Likens and how she was tortured through Gertrude Baniszewski, but despite some at-times scary moments, this is all the film amounts to; the film had some promise, but also pretty dodgy acting, incomplete direction (not without future promise) and a disillusioned soundtrack. The real story behind the crime is far more gruesome and actually is better money spent than this film.",The Girl Next Door
46,RockPortReview,"Shockingly Graphic and Real, A Must See!",8,27 January 2011,"The Girl Next Door 8/10/2010This movie is based on the book of the same name by Jack Ketchum; which is also based on a true story. Not to be confused with the teen sex comedy of the same name from 2004. This film was made a few years later and although it does have teens and sex, the story lines are worlds apart.This is the true story of two sisters who were orphaned back in the late 1950's when their parents were killed in a car accident. Meg is the older sister at about 15 and her sister Susan is about 10 or 11. Susan is also a recovering polio survivor and has to wear leg braces. These girls taken in (or pushed upon) by Aunt Ruth a popular neighborhood spinster. All of the neighborhood boys hang out at Ruth's, they range in age from about 8-15, she gives then beer lets them smoke and so much worse. The story is told through flashback by David, the one boy who sought to save the girls from the evils that happen in the basement of Ruth's house. David and Meg meet on a few occasions and strike up a nice friendship, but when Meg tells him that that she and her sister are not being fed, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Ruth is brutally strict to the girls and purposely humiliates Meg in front of the boys. Things rapidly escalate, when Meg goes to the police about the abuse. Meg is then tied up in the basement and stripped naked with everybody present. Ruth rants to the boys her slanted views of young women, but tells them not to touch her. This doesn't last long.This movie works on so many levels; it's a brutal psychological horror film, an intense character study, and a coming of age story. Ruth is obviously severely disturbed, but doesn't know it. David feels powerless to stop Ruth and the other boys. Susan is abused, but not beaten; she is also forced to watch as her sister is tortured by the boys. This movie goes to the darkest places you can imagine. Some scenes are just as brutal to the audience as they are to Meg. David plans an escape attempt for the sisters but that too is snuffed out by Ruth. Can this story have a ""happy"" ending? Doubt it. It is an intensely heart wrenching film that will stay with you for days. Like most movies that claim to be ""true stories"", parts were probably embellished and made more dramatic but the core story is still disturbing beyond belief.",The Girl Next Door
47,Indyrod,"Extremely disturbing, and the last fifteen minutes are hard to watch...",8,18 November 2007,"Based on a true story, this is one sick and very very disturbing movie. A foster Mother has a couple of young Sisters join her foster family, and the boy next door becomes friendly with the oldest girl. The foster Mother is an unbelievable bitch, and for no reason gives the younger impaired with leg braces Sister a spanking with a long brush for nothing. But it's the older Sister that gets taken to the basement and strung up by her wrists as other kids begin to torment her, stripping her, torturing her, even raping her later, while the foster Mother encourages them on. And believe me, the worst was still to come for this girl. The boy next door tries his best to help her, but there's not much he can do, except never forget it for the rest of his life. I was glued to this movie, as was everybody else watching it, and when it was over, it was like wow, that was one disturbing movie. You'll probably hear about ""Girl Next Door"", especially being a true story, and I would suggest you check it out. The last fifteen minutes are pretty hard to watch. I saw the movie at a special preview at the Indianapolis Horror Hound Weekend convention.",The Girl Next Door
48,maximkong,Better than 'An American Crime',6,24 November 2012,"This is a lot better than 'An American Crime' for being daring to show the deeper side of the abuse and its effects on a girl based on a case that really happened during the '60s. In this way, the film does a little more justice to the latter in showing people what Sylvia actually went through and the true nature of some of the inhumane housewife, without 'humanising' them. However it is based on the novel, not the actual events that happened. It also has its flaws--the girl wasn't raped actually or else the police wouldn't know she is still a virgin. Probably in the novel they changed the details quite a bit. Hopefully there will be a remake soon in the future.",The Girl Next Door
49,deadbull-95171,Horrific,10,29 October 2021,"I've seen a lot of unpleasant things in film. And I worked 13 years in a hospital emergency room and have seen and read about the Likens Baniszewski case, texts and transcripts, not just the usual online palaver.I saw this when it came out, and already knew about it so was interested in how this hideous story would be adapted, and sure, i wanted what anyone wants from horror movies, the remote sadistic titillation, why deny it?; it accounts for the genre's popularity, to sit our fat cowardly butts back and enjoy somebody else's pain.Although it parts from reality in some ways, particularly in the final atrocities that I'll let other people spoil for you, the movie captures the ""spirit"" of the reality all too well. I went back to it tonight and actually turnrf it off because it was too ugly for me and I'm a real trooper when it comes to tolerating grotesque stuff.But this is simply too authentic and genuinely pathetic to watch. The only case that probably exceeds it is what Lawrence ""Pliers"" Bittaker did with his partner to multiple victims, the worst being. Shirley Ledford. In that case the famous prosecutor began crying when interviewed. People ran from the courtroom in tears when they played the recordings the killers made of the torture sessions, and those crimes are so intimately gruesome and medieval and prolonged that I suppose comparing them to what happened to the child in this movie 'flatters' it within in its own rarified context.This is not a classic horror movie. It's a fairly pornographically depicted documentary of a truly disturbing profoundly pathetic horrible and amazingly depraved and perverse actual event.Movies like Unhinged, which I found largely comedic, don't approach the depths suggested here. The acting is good, and as much as I like and respect K Keener's movie on the same topic, that one, ""An American Crime"", suffers in comparison because it has more skill. This has more of
the charm of a snuff film.The Dnepropetrovsk maniacs from the Ukraine comes to mind. The leaked footage of one of their 21 kills was hot on the internet, and it's quite something what can be done with a screwdriver and a pocket knife and a pliers etc when applied to eyeballs and genitals and opened up body cavities of still living victims. And all totally real, filmed ""on-site"" by the laughing teenager's doing it, on their beloved cell phones, plenty of close-ups. And that wasn't ""dark Web"" either. It was all over the place on the web.And even that, as extreme as it was, was not as unsettling to me as this movie. This one exceeds reality. It is very artfully artless. The systematic destruction of innocence with such malice and gratuitous sadism is not so cool in your face if you have managed to retain some gentleness in your nature. 15 years ago it was unpleasant, but now, it seems obscene and unacceptable.But I defend the right to produce this stuff, and if this has any 'value' it is an intimate portrait of human limits on the wrong side. Like good old E. A. Poe. In his discursive pieces and even in stories like 'The Premature Burial"" if I recall, he explains how real horror is specific to the agonies of an individual, a talented sadist is very empathic with the suffering he or she causes. As far as what moves us, it is less hearing about mass killings, and our nerves thrill ( a Poe term) at the misery of the buried alive individual etc, not the 3000 or 6 million dying in a natural or man made ""holocaust"" or pandemic
.I agree with that, The suffering of an individual, in HD focus, and a genuinely lovely one, (the real victim was sort of beautiful) is more within our grasp of empathy, then the awfulness of vast numbers killed by war etc.And so much for this topic. It is worth watching, especially if your in a mood to feel miserable, and if you are a budding torture killer, right up your alley.",The Girl Next Door

52,tequila101,I'll never forget this...,9,24 April 2011,"The Girl Next Door is definitely the most disturbing film out there since other cult films such as Cannibal Holocaust and Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer. The Girl takes all of those elements right over the top with a really depressing and disturbing atmosphere.It's got that grip that you hold onto because we first off get verbal abuse which suddenly turns into psychotic, physical torture. The large jump from these two elements makes this film more real, more powerful and more hard to watch as torture is the main target. It's also gripping because this is inspired by actual events in 1958.Let's talk about the film. The acting is way beyond excellent because the characters are very realistic. Of course the climax is very high on mood and atmosphere with it's grueling disturbing tone, the story just builds up very well, the music is just classic, the cinematography looks as if this was filmed in the late 80's or early 90's and the film's elements and scenes are just way beyond me.The thing I really liked was the main protagonist, David was very believable.

53,McQualude,Left me squirming in my seat not wanting those thoughts in my head.,6,9 December 2007,"The Girl Next Door tells the story of young Meg & Susie sent to live with their twisted, misogynistic aunt who uses her little cabal of local boys to humiliate, beat, rape and torture Meg. Based on the book by Jack Ketchum which is based on the true story of Sylvia Likens. The acts are unspeakable and go to show that real life often holds more horror than any fiction. Overall the direction is weak which is not too surprising as this is only Gregory Wilson's second film, the first being somewhat of a turd. The actors and actresses do well in spite of the poor direction with good (not great) performances by Daniel Manche, Graham Patrick Martin and Blanche Baker; Blythe Auffarth makes us feel sympathetic but most of her scenes involve her being blindfolded and gagged so she doesn't get as much to work with. The screenplay is well written and surprisingly is also by no name talent. As powerful as the subject is, I can't imagine what it would have been in the hands of a talented director, then again that would have involved a larger studio which would have undoubtedly been heavy handed with the plot and we would have ended up with some piece of trash like Captivity.To dismiss The Girl Next Door as cheap exploitation is not fair to the film-makers who have managed to evoke genuine feeling, disgust and despair from the audience. Of all the characters in the film, little David was the most repugnant because of all the characters he understood that what was happening was wrong but begrudgingly went along until it was too late to prevent an atrocity. Nudity is sparse and mostly glancing or shadowed, none is gratuitous. Don't go in expecting gore either, the horror is in your mind and will haunt you long after the film ends. Many reviews warned of the last fifteen minutes but they are wrong, the last fifteen minutes are anticlimactic; it is the events right before the last fifteen minutes that left me squirming in my seat half turning my head, not wanting to see or even think about what was to happen.",The Girl Next Door
54,princebansal1982,Harrowing but still not perfect,4,30 May 2011,"This is a very harrowing movie about child abuse and deserves its R rating. It is almost at par with some of the violent and harrowing Korean films in evoking dreadful feelings. You want to look away but you can't help watching.While movie as a whole is good it is far from perfect, I think it leaves such an impression due to the horrific instances shown rather than the expertise of those involved in making this film. I have seen two other movies on this topic, An American Crime and Aurore. In my opinion both of them very much better than ""The Girl Next Door"", especially in terms of acting. An American Crime has Ellen Page and Catherine Keener in key roles and comparing their performances with this movie, everything just seems a bit off-key here.A very good movie, but mostly due to its subject matter rather than execution.",The Girl Next Door
55,alanmora,WOW! What a powerful punch this one packs!,10,26 November 2007,"Before I get into the film let me briefly surmise the actual case that this film is based on. Firstly, the actual case of Sylvia Likens was in reality much more brutal than this movie portrays. If you can try for a moment to wrap your mind around that fact than you can begin to fathom the unbelievable torture that this young woman actually endured. The actual case took place in the 1960s but for some odd reason this story is set in the 1950s this is where the confusion begins. Also, in the actual case, Sylvia was not raped nor was she forced to suffer the final indignity that the character in this movie does. That aside, this is a shockingly brutal and powerful film...yes the acting is stiff but I do believe that this was intentional in order to reflect the times. This film is a period piece and should be taken as such. When you take a look at the cast and realize the caliber of actors/actresses in this film anyone can easily see that these are not bad actors. Much of the brutality in this film is implied violence rather than in your face blood and guts. There are cut-aways during some of the more intense moments of the torture scenes but in many ways this makes things even worse! In this sense, this is genius film making. It makes the viewer believe that they have seen something much more horrific than they actually have, not to say that this makes the images seen in this film any less disturbing. A friend of mine who watched this film with me told me that he was unable to sleep for the rest of the night because of this film...and we're talking about a grown man in his late thirties! That's the sort of impact a film like this has. I am looking forward to ""An American Crime"" which is based on the court transcripts of the actual case and should adhere more to the facts but nonetheless ""The Girl Next Door"" is a film that punches you in the gut and refuses to relinquish it's grip on your senses.",The Girl Next Door

Why didn't anyone do something? You think people are so cruel? Sure, some of them are, but again - so many in one place? Only for hitting the little boy one time? I mean yes - aunt had her own reasons, but not the children. And aunt isn't worried at all that someone will tell their parents about this? Why? This is more improbable and overdone than ""Salo."" Sorry guys, it isn't a masterpiece, it isn't ""the truthful story"" and I'm not really sure if you could call this a horror movie, again, coming back to ""Salo"" - it doesn't have ""horror"" genre attached in it's description, but it's ten times more disturbing than this flick.

63,PaulyC,strong thriller,7,5 September 2008,"There are many who will watch this expecting a full out horror or exploitation film. It is neither of those but a strong thriller based on real events. It takes place in 1958 which follows the nightmarish story of two adolescent girls, who upon losing their parents in an accident, are forced to stay with their Aunt Ruth. A witness to this is young David who lives next door and develops feelings for one of the girls named Meg. Meg and her younger sister, Susan, who's legs are in metal slings, are routinely abused by their Aunt Ruth and three cousins. Finally Meg is accused falsely of being a whore and tied up in the basement where she is raped, beaten and worse (you'll see) by aunt Ruth and willing cousins. David witnesses a lot of this cruelness but his disinterested parents don't really buy his stories. Meg is played very effectively by Blythe Auffarth and Blanche Baker is very memorable as Aunt Ruth, who plays the role not as a wild psychopath, but with subtlety as a woman who believes what she's doing is right. Anybody watching this should hate her and if you find yourself taking sides with her, please see a shrink. I haven't disliked a woman in a film this much since nurse Rachet in One Flew Over The Cuccoo's Nest. Although the movie is graphic, as it should be, it is not overdone.

64,ghost-9,Feels like a kick in the gut-ouch! We cried.,8,16 December 2007,"While the movie should not be banned, I think it should come with a strong warning on the DVD box as some people not familiar with writers like Jack Ketchum, Edward Lee, and Charlee Jacob, might not know what they are in for, as these are some of the most hardcore writers getting published today, they are known for writing very explicit, visceral horror that makes Stephen King look like a pussycat in comparison, (no offense, Mr. King, we love your work!)I've enjoyed reading the comments for this movie, and I see from reading these that the movie affected other viewers much as it affected my wife and I. Wow, this is really a nasty, vicious story and hard to watch. Unlike some horror movies where you might laugh at the killer, i.e. Freddy Krueger or even root for him, like the lovable killer Christian Slater played in Heathers or the girl in American Psycho 2, or perhaps the charismatic Hannibal Lector, this is really a grueling torture movie where the victim is particularly helpless and as many reviewers have pointed out, children are taught to torture and to enjoy it, which makes it very subversive (and realistic), indeed. I think it relates to current events as well, and addresses the questions of the morality of torture in an excellent fashion. While humans are not the only species that tortures(ever seen a cat play with a mouse)we are the ones who should know better. The way this builds in a slow fashion leaves us almost like the frog in the water which is slowly heated on the stove. Before we know it, we're boiled.",The Girl Next Door

If I were Davie, I would have taken a knife from the kitchen and killed Ruth and as many of her boys as I could and set the girl and her sister free.One harsh criticism I have of this movie and maybe even the book it was based on is this. Should it have ever even been released? I got to thinking about it and the girl the Hulu original series ""The Act"" is based on, Gypsy Rose Blanchard, was actually going to sue Hulu because she did not agree to have her story shared like that and didn't want it to be. I don't know if she ever did though. I know the names are changed in The Girl next Door, but its the same concept. Would Sylvia Likens have wanted her story to be shared in this fashion?

The cinematography is unlike typical horror movies; it's bright, colourful & nostalgic - and it is this style of storytelling that instills a false sense of security and safety. This is definitely not comfortable viewing. I gave this title an 8/10 for style, performance & aesthetic appeal. It is one of those movies you will never forget.",The Girl Next Door
71,Vibiana,There is no justification for making this movie!,1,25 February 2008,"As others have noted, this film is loosely based on the story of Sylvia Likens, 16, who was tortured to death in the basement of an Indianapolis house in the summer and fall of 1965. Gertrude Baniszewski, the mentally unbalanced adult who was boarding Sylvia and her sister Jenny, 14, was eventually convicted and served 19 years in prison before being released -- despite public protest -- in 1985. She died of cancer in 1990 while living in Iowa under the name Nadine Van Fossan. Gertrude's children and some neighborhood boys were also involved in the torture and some served prison sentences of their own. One of the neighbor boys died of cancer within a few years after the murder.There are two books written about this case -- one by Natty Bumppo and the other by Kate Millett. If you want to know about this case, read one of those books. They were written by people who treated this story with the dignity Sylvia was denied -- not exploiters like Jack Ketchum who just wanted to sell books, nor sleazoids like the people who made this movie, who just wanted to glorify the unspeakable depths to which some ""humans"" can sink. Blanche Baker, the only name actor in this production, ought to be jailed for agreeing to be part of this travesty, which amounts to little more than a snuff movie.",The Girl Next Door

Its not a date movie. But its possible it could start some conversations someone out there needs to have. The family in Cali who chained up 17 kids some of them adults for years while they starved to death is still worse than any movie. I hope that doesn't become a film.

75,Nightmare-Maker,Simply Awesome Film-making,10,14 December 2007,"After just sitting through Jack Ketchums THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, I had mixed emotions, but mainly I felt extremely sad at what I had just watched. The film is a true story set in the 50's about a two young sisters who go to live with their aunt after losing both parents in a car accident. The younger sister got badly injured and has to walk with steel frames supporting her legs. But her older sister, Meg, takes care of her and in general is a really nice kid. But when they go to live with their aunt, things turn nasty, really nasty. The aunt is a really horrible person, she has all the local lads round her home all the time drinking beer and doing basically anything they please. But aunt really does call the tune, anything she says - goes! And as soon as she takes a dislike to Meg thats when the torture and downright cruelty begins. Now, I'm not going to go into any great detail, but what happens to Meg in this film is disturbing, but incredibly engrossing to watch.The acting on all fronts is nothing short of brilliant, the detail on the set is stunning, bearing in mind it is set in the 50's the attention to detail is excellent.How anybody can give this a low rating beats me - if you don't think you are going to like it, don't watch it - it is'nt nice, but it is an essential piece of film-making, well written, well directed, well acted - and devastatingly delivered.AWESOME...10 out of 10.",The Girl Next Door

It is a brilliant; yet upsetting and very disturbing film. I consider this one of my favourite films of all time, if not my favourite. What makes this film is the actor's themselves, the dialogue and the affect it has on the audience. After the exceedingly slow start the film turned into a real Drama and was definitely one of the most disturbing things I've seen and will ever see in my life time. I, at only 12 years old thought this film was just, brilliant. Some images are still in my head because of how it disturbed me, it was violent and definitely a winner. It made me more upset when I realised this was a true story, considering I'm a fan of Horror I thought an escape to a sad drama story would be good, I read some reviews and thought it sounds really good, I knew it would disturb me and now I've realised how realistic and explicit it was.

'The Girl Next Door' is not a horror movie, but instead, a drama that includes some very sadistic moments of torture-porn.The movie, which is based on a Jack Ketchum novel, which is based on a real life case that took place in the 60's, tells the story of the horrible abuse suffered by a young girl at the hand of her aunt and her cousins, who lock her up in the basement where they physically and sexually abuse her. It's also a story of one of the boys who befriended the girl, but is unable to stop her abuse, and how that regret stick with him.I imagine that this is the kind of movie that people feel strongly about, regardless of whether they like it or hate it. My issue with the movie was that it just seemed kind of pointless and exploitative, under a veneer of integrity that doesn't actually lack. I agree that stories like these have to be told, but The Girl Next Door lacked taste IMO, which might seem odd coming from someone who thinks 'Martyrs' is one of the greatest modern horror films in the past decade.

However, I believe they still should have been tried in a court of law.I'm simply saying that the graphic nature of this movie could have been toned WAY down & still amply communicated the sheer horror of the incident.I feel equally sorry for the viewers of this film AND the actors, actresses & crew involved in the making of this sick film. You cannot act in scenes as contained in this movie & not be horribly & irreparably stained by them, much less view the finished product.Again, I in no way minimize the serious & heinous nature of the torture & murder.

80,pete-murphy97,A transient tale of inhumanity,8,27 September 2014,"This film embodies a disturbing and frighteningly realistic approach to telling a true story. 'The Girl Next Door' challenges the viewers to see from a more plausible perspective; the conceptualisation and then enactment of heinous abuse on youths is particularly numbed from our spectral expectations; the media often brushes over the subject with scarcity and obscurity, this film elaborates the connotations of that aversion in an implicitly wayward light of realism.We see the spurring character 'Ruth', the mother of numerous children, burdened by past marriages, with her mental stability questionable; she comes forth to execute her inner chaos on the 'civilized' world. This film conveys Ruth who most likely was patronised for her sentimentality, the expectation of gender roles and her compatibility with certain individuals which drove her to the point of psychological torment, her spontaneous implications spawned the most repugnant and abhorrent conformity of upheaval, the reclaiming of her dignity. We see this perpetrated through her clamouring for 'virginity' she finds justification through afflicting her pain unto another, she wanted another to feel the calamity of belittlement as she had experienced herself, taking the familial token from 'Meg' represents the feeling she suffered, being robbed of a fragile, frigid sentimentality. The continuation from lesser abuses to the more contingent eventualities of extremism complies with the idea Ruth was deprived of her self assurance, so much so her unilateral state of assertion proved her to be trapped in a recess of her demented circumstances, this is further shown in her disregard for moral attempts to sway her judgements from characters such as 'David' - a debatable protagonist; in some ways he was deceived into following the pied piper of misguided adulthood into the cave of dire misfortunes. The more disturbing sequences were the genital mutilation/rape scenes, in which I will proceed to analyze from a holistic perspective. From the blatancy of the focal objectives choreographed, we can observe how Ruth is furthering the intensity of her distorted intentions. Rape and genital mutilation are the kingpins of abolishing dignity among one's esteem, we can assume that Ruth was obliged to let this happen again, from her deep emotive compass dictating her allusions to feeling objectified and unappreciated and the gesture she despised juveniles in some manner as a widow. Overall this film is worthy of viewership, but only to an audience willing to be entrants to a stronger emplacement of explicitness.",The Girl Next Door

What Sylvia Likens endured was beyond belief or that of any imagination. I am truly shaken just attempting to comprehend the horrors visited upon that girl. And any attempt at imaging how any human could do that that to a fellow human being is utterly incomprehensible. It's a tragedy of such malicious proportions my mind is incapable of accepting such truths about the vicious intent of human behaviour.

84,CriticalRaccoon,Designed To Disturb And Not Much Else,6,24 February 2020,"Do you want to see a film based on an historical crime that is about a teenage girl getting shamed and later tortured for its entire runtime? Well, The Girl Next Door (2007) might be your cup of tea. Based on the 1989 Jack Ketchum book of the same name which was loosely inspired by the murder of Sylvia Likens, The Girl Next Door is what you get if you wanted to make a realistic torture movie that was designed more to disturb than to shock. Directed by Gregory M. Wilson, The Girl Next Door knows what it wants to be, and that's one of the most graphically haunting movies ever made.In some ways I feel like the historical connection is what saves The Girl Next Door from being labeled as one of the most offensive pieces of media ever conceived. It was crafted to stick in your mind.Beginning in 2007 with old-man David (William Atherton) saving a hit-and-run victim while other onlookers do nothing (it's New York, what do you expect), we then immediately flash back to 1958 and see the 12-year-old David (Daniel Manche) meet the new girl in town Meg (Blythe Auffarth) who just moved next door. Meg and her sister Susan (Madeline Taylor) recently got in a car accident that killed both there parents and are now living with their 'popular' Aunt Ruth (Blanche Baker) - an oddly charming lady who lets the neighborhood kids over to smoke and drink beer. Ruth, who loves her boys, absolutely detests and horrifyingly berates Meg and Susan for, basically, being women. I find this odd because she has no problem with the neighborhood girls, but maybe they were more 'traditional' women that bowed to her.What starts as insults where Ruth calls Meg and Susan promiscuous evolves into physical torture of Meg after she dares to tell a cop about Ruth's treatment of her and her sister. Ruth, her children, and some of the neighbor kids all take turns cutting, burning, beating, raping and even more to Meg - all while our 'hero' David sits back and watches. Sure, David does half-heartedly try to tell his parents about the crimes, but that's about it. David tries a couple of times to help Meg out a bit, but for the most part he's a passive observer to unspeakable atrocities. As you can guess, due to the real life story this is inspired by, The Girl Next Door does not end happily for poor Meg, as we question why the hell David didn't do more. Oh, and back to the 2007 framing narrative for some reason because this was all a life-lesson about helping people apparently.The Girl Next Door is extremely effective in designed discomfort. I've seen countless horror movies and this is easily one of the hardest films I've ever sat through due to the violence depicted rather than simply implied. The absolute focus is on showing the mental and physical torture of Meg. The Girl Next Door might be the closest thing to a snuff film I've ever seen from a studio release. As well, this film doesn't get stuck in the overly stylized gimmicks that a lot of ""torture porn"" movies used at the time, so its ultra realistic feel adds to the lingering effect. So I guess if you desperately want to see a teenage girl get tortured for 45-minutes this would suit the bill, though I pray that there isn't an audience for that out there.This emphasis on suffering is also a problem for The Girl Next Door - it's a film about torture with little grounding. We never know why this group of kids, including a 6-year-old, all just want to treat Meg as a thing to inflict pain on aside from Ruth encouraging it. It just jumps straight into the torture without cause. The only vague motivation for Ruth that's given is that she's basically the most misogynistic woman ever to be put to film - stating after physically mutilating Meg's ""cute"" and ""sexy"" body, that ""a woman is better off loathsome in this world"" because all women are disgusting to her and female pleasure should be punished. Because of the lack of story or progress of character The Girl Next Door is an oddly boring movie at times; it's just too passive in its escalation. There just not much driving me to want to watch more of it aside from knowing at some point Meg will finally be put out of her misery.The choice of having David be the main character is, um, odd. The true crime that this movie is loosely based off of is horrifying, but the way they choose to add David is sloppy at best. He's a passive observer for almost all of Meg's suffering, and just chooses to do nothing even though he knows that it's wrong. He never calls the cops and tell them that Meg is being tortured in the basement or gets his parents to do so - nope, he just passively watches while not really seeming overly bothered by what's happening until it reaches the level of physical mutilation. This seems like a choice that might work better in written form when you might better understand why David just stands around and does nothing. Is David supposed to be an allegory for society standing by and doing nothing to save people right in front of them? Maybe, but there's a difference between watching a person get hit by a car and doing nothing (see the 2007 scenes bystanders) and repeatedly returning to see your friend and love interest be tortured for days even though you know you need to stop it.Not helping matters is the fact that the performances is all over the place. Despite spending half the time tied up and bleeding I thought that Blythe Auffarth's performance as Meg was the only commendable one in the movie - ignoring the fact that she's a 21-year-old playing a 14-year-old falling in love with a 12-year-old. Blanche Baker as Ruth gives an oddly haunting-if-unsubtle performance; her ability to intimidate with her physical presence is impressive. All the child actors are pretty bad here, and their delivery of lines as if they were part of the Sawyer family in Texas Chainsaw doesn't help. Yeah, this is not a well scripted movie, especially for the children, but it does know how to be unsettling at times.Honestly The Girl Next Door could have been a horror classic had it spent more time getting the viewer invested before diving headfirst into uninhibited viciousness. It's plot is bare-bones at best, some of its performances feel at odds with the tone and it's defining characteristic is how disturbing its torture scenes can be. The Girl Next Door is a thoroughly unpleasant sit that should not be watched lightly. It's grim, dark and bloody, and seems to relish in disturbing the audience every way it can - a choice I commend it for as few films dare to go where this one does. The Girl Next Door is effective in what it sets out to be - a truly bleak tale of brutality inflicted on a teenage girl - but I can't help but feel like this movie could have been so much better if Wilson spent as much time with character development as he did in showing the worst in humanity.3 out of 5",The Girl Next Door
85,msb-utils,"Great drama, not for the weak",10,11 September 2009,"One of the best dramas I ever watched, very chocking and strong. It made me feel bad, as a really good drama is supposed to.I put myself in the place of the main character, who is just a child watching terrible things he can't believe are possible or acceptable. He wants to help the girl that is being tortured, but feels helpless facing an adult. The lack of credibility a child has before the police, when an adult woman contradicts the information given by a child, and the oppression that the same woman uses over the child are some examples of why the main character feels like he can't do anything. His agony rises even more with the feeling of guilt, because in his childish understanding he sees himself as responsible for the start of the worst tortures. The best he can think of doing is pretending to be in her game, while trying to find a way to help the tortured girls.The movie has a great environment and a great story, that it is very well told. It unrolls naturally. The acting is very good overall, making the story very believable. The only actor that (seldom) didn't seem completely natural is the main actor (the boy), but it's perfectly understandable, as it is a very demanding role and he is a young actor. When I read the other reviews, the only negative/low grade ones I could find are either of those people comparing the movie to the book (which I didn't read - and anyway, a movie is always a different work, so it should be assessed independently) or from the people who consider this movie too disturbing and didn't like it, failing to understand the fact that a DRAMA is supposed to be that way.Oh, I saw someone saying it was child pornography... whoever can get near to excited with this movie must be really really really sick.",The Girl Next Door

The movie is low budget, as something containing this subject matter could never get the big budget glossy treatment, but cast and crew have done a great job. So technically despite the low budget everything is top notch, which makes what goes on even more disturbing. And the fact that it is TRUE. I haven't red the book but I did see the dissimilar at the end of the movie that states. Any similarity to actual persons is purely Coincidental. So I was hoping the events that just unfolded on the screen were entirely made up. But too my horror, on the DVD extras, Director and novelist state this is what happened Be Warned! This is a very difficult watch. Not because it's a bad movie, because it's a good one. It's not anyone's idea of entertainment but I do think movies like this should be made, if not done in an exploitive way, which is what I think the filmmakers have managed to avoid, although I did find the nudity unnecessary.

Taboo subjects in society change rapidly over the years and this film deals with argumentibly the most taboo, certainly a topic most people find hard to talk about. Abuse and torture happen. Fact. What this film managed to do for me is to take both subjects and ram them down my throat at a more than uncomfortable rate. And that is the story line. No humour. No romance as such and no happiness. For me this was not entertainment. I guess some people will enjoy this film, in the same way that people like to rubber neck at accidents when they drive past.

Perfectly cast, this once attractive woman has given into her bitterness and misogynistic hatred. (Did I miss any allusions of her hubby(ies) leaving her for other women?) Any vespice of decency has evaporated. Her skin grows more ragged, pale and lined with each cigarette that mephistocoleanly cascades around her heavily made up face. What makes her so mezmerizing is her command of both language and seductive techniques. The children, some of which are devious to be begin with, fall to Ruth's most primitive primeval desires. Although the film respects its victims to never display any of the sexual abuse on-screen, Ruth's permanent content smile serves the salacious quotient. Oh my, and her voice is god-awful pleasant, delicious - akin to a ripe deep red strawberry sliding down your throat. Although heavy-handed (and apparently not historcially accurate) the movie's visual style impressively mocks the pure, clean-living images usually associated with white-bread 1950's Americana. Outside the cemetery-grey basement, the colors are bright, sunny and filled with the promise of budding adolescence. As to keep the audience horrifyingly subjected to Ruth's hold over the children, certain logical problems of prevention - aka either the children or the system preventing Ruth from caring for so many children - arose. Also, the forment of jealousy inside Ruth over Meg's burgeoning good looks, and other situational contexts are dismissed for intimacy concerns.

You have literal chills, you're maybe a little queasy, and you wonder if maybe there really IS a monster under the bed. This is that type of story.And when the monsters are the family next door...",The Girl Next Door
98,CobraLaLaLa,2 hour torture film,7,7 April 2008,"This Movie was HORRIBLE, with a capital H. This movie is nothing more then 2 hours of torture. The kids in this movie are so moronic it's ridiculous. More so the kid next door then anyone else. The cripple girl is a mute who next speaks or even cries until the very end of the movie. Her sister is brutally tortured throughout the movie and she's emotionless. The kid is a coward, who see's this girl being mutilated each and everyday and he never tells anyone. This movie frustrates you for 2 whole hours and never gives you satisfaction that you so desperately want. We all know kids tattle right? Not in this movie. Practically every kid in the neighborhood witnesses this girl get destroyed and nobody says a word. ""Stop Snitching"" was in effect way back in 50's I guess. Bottom line, this is a torture film starring kids and I wouldn't let me kids see it if I had any. I don't films like SAW mind you, so I'm really not into pointless torture. And if there is a build up of a sort, there is suppose to be a release for the watcher for enduring the build up. There is none. This movie ends and your still upset. The girl in this movie by the way who was being tortured is a hell of an actor. I was EXTREMELY impressed with her performance. One of the best I've ever seen. I wanted to bust through my LCD screen the entire time I was watching it. There were no heroes in this movie. It was Gotham without Batman. So you'll watch, you'll be horrified, you'll be frustrated about the things they do to this girl, and when it goes off, you'll still be horrified, and frustrated, and in disbelief because nobody told what was happening. For that let down I will give this movie a 7, but let me clarify right now, THIS MOVIE GETS A 7 BECAUSE OF THE GIRLS PERFORMANCE! The movie itself was like watching someone get put in the Iron Maiden.",The Girl Next Door
99,fredschepers,You can feel this story.,10,25 January 2016,"Everybody experiences a film different. Some like to watch known actors, some like scenery, and others just like a certain genre. For me a film is good if I can forget all that made the film, and when I can connect with the characters and the story. And in this case... I could feel this film! Sadness, anger, judgment, miss understanding and understanding all of it.So what about the film? Iam not going to spoil it. I've known the real story about Sylvia Likens, and tho it's not 100% the same, this film is a must watch, if you into these events. We read a lot about these events in the newspaper (Fritzl and others) but seeing it, makes a difference.As a film 100% emotional. good actors, and the story line?

100,fayesbridegroom,I hated this film.,6,3 June 2013,"The tagline for this film was that it was like a negative version of 'Stand By Me.' I went to the film not knowing much about it. The acting in the film varies greatly. The weirdest thing i found was that the storyteller was supposed to be going through a rite of passage in the movie. But I found his acting to be fairly wooden and unconvincing. The main villain in the film steals the show with her acting. Her script, with lot's of monologue develops her character to a level which just about saves this film from being purely exploitative of children. There is a large exploitative theme that runs through this movie and it is for this reason i would liken it to the original 'Last House On The Left.' But thankfully there is NO humour in this film. So it becomes depressing very quickly. Inside the plot i found a theme of feminism. Of how a young boy can become a man by embracing feminine intuitivity. And on the same level how a stereotypical housewife can loose femininity through liberal barbarianism. If you want to see a film that will disturb then this film quite likely do this.

I really don't know if this film is a good thing to watch , first it is made with mean intentions and you can feel it ,second the story made with kids been manipulated by a sadistic adult is going very far as far as i am concerned and finally its based on a true story !These days there is a big wave of true story's coming out in theater and this one makes me sick in my stomach , to believe that this actually happened is unbelievably sick and making a film out of such a sordid story makes me think of what the intentions truly are behind this.The whole thing goes to far and it is not exposing the facts but bring you like a voyeur to a sick show like i said its more or less the intentions behind this and the viewers own intentions in viewing this.Its a very depressing film and don't forget that when viewed it stays in your subconsciousness for a long time even if you think its not that bad and its just a movie , you could be wrong because the images in this ,the sheer suffering in this movie and there is lots of it is not really very good for the mind , its feeding your deepest fears and it goes in the hell hole and you there looking at the ugliest scenes one cant imagine and you can not do anything but watch ...so thats what i was trying to say when i said if its a good idea to watch this ,all you can do is watch .....Ask your self the question , is it worth it or what !",The Girl Next Door
102,timb75,The dark side of 1950's Suburbia.,8,31 May 2008,"This was a great movie. I guess what made this movie so great is the fact that this is based on a true story. It's a dark trip through 1950's suburbia which most people view as a simple conservative time. Oddly enough I was talking to my mom about this movie and she remembered the actual story from the paper. This is indeed a true story. Names and locations were changed but it is a true story. It's not particularly scary or horrific, it's more sad and depressing. You truly feel sorry for ""The Girl Next Door."" The girl loses so much in her life and now faces even worse circumstances. The movie isn't all depressing. A love story is also embedded into the main story. I'd recommend this movie as a good substitute for a gory horror flick.

The fact such people think ""Who does that?!"" shows the unimaginable extent of the real life crime. I was looking for horror movies to watch and came across this one. I was gonna avoid it before I found out that it was based on real life events. I did some digging in the real case of Sylvia Likens and her death at the hands of Gertrude Baniszewski, one that shocked me to the core. So I watched this movie, and I must say I wasn't disappointed. I also watched the other movie An American Crime, but The Girl Next Door is clearly the better of the two. ** Following may contain spoilers** The thing is the movie raises some important points about the whole case, but the most important is this- Children will become what their parents and elders will teach them to be. Also I would have been more satisfied if the movie also told about the punishment that the perpetrators got for what they did. Other than that, the acting is good, the story could have been developed better, but I'm not complaining much.",The Girl Next Door

I could say a lot about this film, like how the main guy could have done a lot more to help the situation.

105,wave54,No Context!,3,19 December 2007,"Viewing ""The Girl Next Door"" is like watching the middle act of a 3-act play. What is lacking is the backdrop of life for the involved characters before and after the events that are portrayed. We see, for much of the 90 minute runtime, psychological and physical torture of a teenage girl with no direct or indirect explanation for the actions taken. Beyond that, the film offers no clue as to the passivity of the other children who either participate in the crime or merely view it without taking action.All I felt at the end of TGND, is dirty for having watched it with no greater knowledge, insight or understanding for what occurred. I'm not so squeamish that I can't view violence, horror and sadism in the context of a larger story -- the problem here is that, there IS nothing else. TGND comes off as an exploitive, quasi-snuff film and cannot be compared to ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""River's Edge"" or ""Lord of the Flies.""",The Girl Next Door

I've asked myself why the film needed to be made and I can only come to the conclusion that somebody had to do it - just like somebody had to climb Everest.

The real horror of this movie is the FACT that this is a despicable movie. It will teach children that will watch it, (and they definitely will watch it) that gang raping a girl is fun and has barely any consequence when you are young enough.Horrendous movie about violence against children.This girl is tied up in a basement, raped by her cousins and beaten and burnt by her aunt, while the little boy next door (who LOVED HER) stands by and does NOTHING!?!?!?!?What is the point of all this?To me the point is to put these thoughts and images into children's heads so that they can grow up and accept the worst possible situation as NORMAL.

The actors did a wonderful job in highlighting the characteristics of their respective roles. May it be innocence, naivety, or the unimaginable evil. Also, Blanche Baker did a tremendous job in playing the twisted aunt, mortally wounding the girl. In the end i almost hated her as a person and not as a character alone, such was her performance.I thought the director did a wonderful work in bringing out the sadistic nature of the entire saga without going overboard. The crew members of franchises like saw and hostel can learn a lesson from him. He proved that you can make a torture flick without actually showing all the bloodshed and gore. I have seen saw 2 and hostel and could not watch the torture scenes, but here as it was not as explicit, it was much more powerful and made a much lasting impression.Overall i think this is a breakthrough in this genre and the fact that it is inspired by a true story makes it all the more twisted.",The Girl Next Door

Not brave enough to watch it again or throw it away.
The director must be crazy to make this kind of movie. The movie itself was not that explicit but brutal than any other movies out there.
There is no reason for this girl to be treated like this. No reason at all that makes this movie more scary.
Her cousins and her aunt have absolutely no reason to rape her, torture her to death. They deserve to die at the end but their death will not return the main charactor's suffer, her life because she dies at some point before they all are caught.
Again the director graduated the best art school in America with scholarship by happens to be a crazy guy to make this kind of mentally sick film.

114,mickey dripping,Chilling,9,15 January 2011,"I watched this movie on DVD late at night and I was chilled. It is difficult to watch. There is horror. There is violence which is more inferred than glorified. The victims are children. So are the perpetrators. Like all good horror movies the script moves slowly but inexorably away from a world of normality to one when people stop to act rationally. And for that reason the story made me squeamish. I kept thinking when will the scriptwriter provide the twist to return the world back to what it really is. I also thought back to the events of my own childhood. I was a child in the era in which the film is set.As kids, we got into some scrapes. We had lots of time to have fun and we arranged our own activities. We did bad things from time to time and yes, we were occasionally cruel. Weaker and vulnerable kids did get picked on. It was easier to hide your own weaknesses by allowing the misfit to be bullied than to end up being the victim. But we always had limits. We were good kids searching for the boundaries of acceptable behavior. In group mode the ones who overdid the anti- social behavior were eventually shunned or rebuked by others in the ""gang"". We never went too far. In this story, however, the kids sense of justice and understanding of what is acceptable is distorted by the mother, Ruth, who is excellently portrayed in the film, who is bitter, twisted, evil and vicious. Her distorted mind and actions encourage to her sons when she should be the person to keep them in check. It was interesting to reflect on the group mentality among children. I think I will have to re- read Lord of the Flies.",The Girl Next Door

116,Nywildcat1,It Will Make You ANGRY,6,4 January 2012,"I'm writing this review as I'm watching the movie, not because I find it boring, or uninteresting, but as a way to distract myself from the violent and disturbing images on the screen.I normally don't watch movies like this, especially ones that depict any form of child abuse, but I erroneously added this to my Netflix instant list thinking it was a horror movie. And what a horror it is. And the fact that this occurred in real life, makes it all the more horrifying.*********************SPOILERS BELOW************************************ The violence portrayed in the movie,though incredibly disturbing, isn't as graphic as some people have said elsewhere. Instead, a lot of it is more implied, such as when Ruth burns Meg with her cigarette. And, as we all know, sometimes what you don't see can be worse than what is actually shown.The acting in the movie is superb, especially by the boy who plays David (the, for lack of a better word, ""hero"" of the movie). And Ruth is practically the personification of evil.However, there were a few drawbacks to the movie. Having never read the book, or being familiar with the true story this movie is based on, I don't know if the filmmakers' decided to leave out certain plot points on purpose, or if they were never really there to begin with. You never really know why Ruth started abusing the girls (especially Meg) to begin with. You do see the progression from verbal to physical abuse, but no background is actually given on Ruth other than her husband left her. Perhaps this was done purposely so that the viewer doesn't begin to feel any empathy for Ruth. Leaving the causes unknown perhaps adds to the evil. Also, though I understand Ruth's children not caring about what's being done to Meg (since they were probably used to their mother being abusive, though this is never shown in the movie towards them)and participating in the abuse, I don't understand the other neighborhood children being let in on it and not doing anything. Especially during the scene where two other neighborhood girls stand by and watch Meg get raped and then have her clitoris burned off with a blow torch. What's the excuse for them? Why aren't they running and screaming and shouting what's going on to the whole neighborhood? Also, even though David winds up doing the right thing in the end, he sure takes a heck of a long time to get there. Why isn't he telling his parents? I don't know how many dramatic liberties where taken with the actual story, and it seems to me that Meg and her sister had many an opportunity to escape. David had seen enough to corroborate her story in case the police didn't believe her. I know it was the 1950's and the times were different, but something just rings a bit hollow.All in all, it is an immensely disturbing film, and as I said in my headline, if you have any humanity in you, it will definitely make you Angry that something like this could actually happen.",The Girl Next Door

But I guess I felt like I had to see it through. Most of the direct abuse is implied and described, which is a method that only adds to the horrifying emotions that result. I believe that the liberties taken in movies when dealing with true crime almost force people to feel what they should be feeling upon learning about such events. It's unfortunate that people skim the news with little emotion. Production, writing, acting and directing are superb in making this story real.

The film revolves around an Auntie who seems to take in all the local children and waif and strays into her household where they are allowed to drink beer like it is squash and are allowed to do pretty much whatever they like, except for the girls, who Auntie Ruth seems to despise. The eldest girl in the home, Meg, is ridiculed and punished until eventually she is cruelly tied up in the basement and tortured and raped. Her best friend David tries to help but Ruth is an evil woman and does everything to avoid the terrible goings on in her basement being discovered.

121,entlerjl,Do yourself a favor and read the book.,3,15 April 2008,"I had the opportunity to read the book well before I watched the movie. I was excited about watching this movie because the book was truly one of the best modern horror novels I have ever read. I couldn't put it down and was horrified and disturbed through out the book and right up to the last intense chapters until the very end.Needless to say, the book should have been left alone as a work of true literary horror. What your mind shows you when you read the book, is a lot more that what was shown or could've been shown in the movie. The whole point of the book was lost in this terribly underacted mis-interpretation of Jack Ketchum's novel. The true horror was laid within the main character David himself as the story unfolds. The mother, Ruth was a lot more scary, evil, and demented than the weakly depicted character in this movie. The neighborhood kids as well as Ruth's boys were much more involved in the torture and it definitely was more explicit than what was shown or could have been shown in this movie.This movie was actually slow and boring and had I not read the book in advance (knowing what was coming), I would have been bored out of my skull. I know the book was a fictionalized version of a true story, for I have looked it up and read the articles about the crime. There was another movie made called An American Crime that is the re-telling of the true story. I don't know if it has been released yet in any format, but I have not seen it and I am awaiting a chance to view it. It couldn't possibly be as bad as this version.If you feel the need to see this movie, I strongly suggest reading the book first.

125,colinmatts,very disturbing,8,24 June 2010,"It would have been very easy to do this film badly. Thankfully, they didn't. The one question I kept asking while watching this movie was: ""why is this happening""? Its hard to understand the motivations of Aunt Ruth or why she has such a loathing for her nieces. Whenever the subject of child sexual abuse is tackled in a movie it has to be treated very, very carefully. This movie manages to give sufficient gravitas to the subject, and, at the same time, pull no punches in its explicitness. If you were to read the synopsis of this movie and see words like ""kidnapping"" ""torture"" ""gang rape"" and ""extreme sexual violence"", you might be forgiven for thinking it was a low budget horror film. But the truly disturbing thing about this movie is how normal the kids seem in every aspect other than their treatment of Megan. There is certainly a question about just how much are the kids to blame, when they are encouraged by the Aunt. The character of David, the boy next door who witnesses Megan's torture, is a complicated one. There are moments in the movie when he has the opportunity to tell his parents or the police about what's going on. Indeed, at the beginning, he almost seems to be a willing participant in the humiliation Megan first receives. The story is told through his eyes and, as an adult, he certainly carries the burden of guilt. Another disturbing thing about this film is that it is set in the 1950s. One simply doesn't associate 1950s, suburban America with the afore mentioned themes of child abuse and sexual violence. Also, the fact that there are other young girls present during the sexual humiliation of Megan is quite bizarre. If you are at all squeamish, then I would seriously recommend that you do not watch this movie. The best thing I can say about it is that I am now going to try get hold of the book.",The Girl Next Door

HOW? This scares the crap out of me. All the boys lined up to rape this girl, time after time, they burned her, cut her up, punched her and then the worst part they burn her genitals with a blow-torch in order to ""make her almost perfect"". No one says a thing. Not one of the kids. Neither are they grossed out by all the foul things they do to this girl, who cries and screams through the whole ordeal, day after day, month after month. No one says anything, they just come back for more. What SICK town is this based in? Because that town needs to be arrested. I hope everyone on that block, all those kids who are now in their 50's today, all need psychological help for what they did. OK enough about the story, lets talk about the HORRIBLE low-budget acting. First off they cast a 24 year old girl in the part of a 14 year old girl. Her voice alone, trying to act like she's 14 was like listening to nails on a chalkboard. There is just something WAY wrong with her. And her with the actor who plays Davey, their scenes were straight out of an ""Acting for Fun and Profit"" video. It was just drama class all the way, you FELT the actors say their lines, but you never felt the actors as the characters. It is safe to say that you can watch this movie on fast forward, I did, just stop every once in awhile to get the gist of whats going on. The actress who played crazy Ruth did a decent job although sometime you really felt her say ""ok I'm going to mess up my hair here and get a faraway look on my face and talk real slow, that will let everyone know that my character is losing her mind"". Most of what everyone did was just painfully obvious..and I hand that over to the director. It was just bad. Now I have to spend all day on the net trying to research this...what happened to Meg? did she die? she was having something like a death scene there at the end but I wasn't sure if she fell asleep or died.

However this film which is based on real life events had me feeling 'upset and angry'. Two young girls are orphaned and sent to live with their aunt, who is against the female sex and spoils her own sons. What unfolds is months of horrendous torture and abuse that will make even the hardest person sit and think.And you get to think that things have come a long way and the events of the films would never be allowed to happen now - would they?

128,Shudder1,Totally engrossing but painful to watch,9,29 August 2007,"This is an excellent film and therefore in some ways it is a pleasure to watch, but anyone who has seen it will know that it's effectiveness in fact makes it almost unbearable to watch.The story revolves around two girls who have recently been orphaned and are sent to live with their aunt who has three young sons. She is a middle aged woman obsessed with feminine purity who sees the new arrivals as a potentially corrupting influence on the masculine world she presides over.She actively encourages her sons to perpetrate more and more severe acts of bullying and sadism against the older girl who is eventually tied up in the basement and used as a play thing by all the neighbourhood children.Only the boy who lives next door, who has become friends with the girl, has a growing sense of unease about the ""games"" which are taking a very sinister turn, yet he is powerless to change the course of events.This film is very well written, directed and performed and is therefore a relentlessly depressing affair which is horribly painful to watch. The aunt is a very cold and manipulative figure whose brutality knows no bounds and her sons quickly warm to her ideals. Realising that they have a free reign under her they too become very savage. The culmination of the acts they perpetrate are some of the most shocking I have ever seen in cinema, all the more shocking because they are perpetrated by children, against another child, encouraged by their mother.Truly gripping. Truly horrifying. Hard to watch and hard to look away.",The Girl Next Door

132,Jack_McSchmock,Pure evil!,8,8 June 2008,"Wow, even some of the reviewers of this movie seem to be at a complete loss of words when they try to describe the picture. They barely understand why it is so frightening, why they can't sleep afterwards or what it is that chills them to the bone. I can offer an explanation: this film depicts acts made of pure evil, evil in its most disturbing form. Not committed by some entertaining movie-maniac like Freddy or Pinhead that cracks jokes while slaughtering folks, but by something that is a lot more frightening, more haunting and terrifying: an entirely normal human being. Other reviewers seem to miss a motive for the atrocities, a reason for the escalation, apart from Ruths obvious derangement and general frustration with life, and ask why the others (especially since they're still kids) join in so easily. They are actually looking for explanations. C'mon, people, wake up! It's the same thing that makes drunk daddy hit his five year old with an empty liquor bottle or beat mommy to a pulp right in front of the eyes of his terror-frozen offspring. Because he can, that's why. Because he's frustrated and in a position of absolute power, and power tends to corrupt, doesn't it? Now, combine this with barely suppressed unfocused anger and you have your motive. First comes frustration, then anger, then violence, then abuse. One might say it's the devils ladder, a downward spiral straight to hell. And when they get to the bottom, sick individuals like Ruth might even get some revolting kind of kick out of the fact they can use and abuse the weak to their liking. Just like a kid that tortures a frog or beats up a smaller co-ed, tapes it with a handy-cam and posts the clip on youtube to boast with his inhumanity. Plus, you never needed the devil to rape, mutilate or open up a KZ - a mere human will always suffice. So, to the rest of you: be warned, folks, if you're looking for cheap thrills, this is not the right movie for you. Neither is there anything in it one in his right mind could ""enjoy"", like, let's say, your average horror flick. Rather be prepared to be filled up with anger and sadness to the bottom of your very soul. I won't watch this a second time, but surely its art, though not the pleasant kind.8/10",The Girl Next Door

But either way, you will agree... this movie grabs a hold of you and it won't let go!Regardless of what actually happened in real life, or was portrayed in the books... this movie provokes a strong emotion in you. And it takes you to a place you don't want to be. You will feel disgusted, sad, angry, sick, and that's just for starters.Warning: This movie is not for the squeamish!!! For me personally, it made me feel helpless. Because you are sitting there watching the movie unfold, and you can't do anything to stop it. And that for me, was the worse feeling of all.Technical aspects: The acting is great. The dialogue is obscene. The nudity and sexual situations are disgusting. But it brings a realism that could not be achieved otherwise! Bottom line: This movie will give you a small taste of what it's like to be victimized, or be near someone that has.

I am still deeply disturbed and have been for days after seeing this film. I don't think a film has ever affected me so much.""The Girl Next Door"" is based on the true (yes TRUE events) story of a young girl named Meg and her sister Susan who move in with a foster mom after their parents are killed in an accident. The foster mom begins to abuse the girls and then singles out Meg and gets her kids and numerous kids in the neighborhood to abuse her. She is starved, raped, beaten, burnt, and many other horrible things. She is abused like this for 3 months until ultimately, she dies.Meg is played by the sweet and innocent Blythe Auffarth. She is so charismatic and looks beautiful on screen. She plays Meg hauntingly well. Whether she's screaming, crying in despair, or just laying looking down right pathetic, she never loses the audience. You really want this girl to survive. You really want to kill the evil people doing this to her.Which brings me to our main villain. Ruth Chandler. She is played by Blanche Baker who I HATED in this film. No, I didn't hate her acting. Her acting was amazing, which is why I hated her. She is vile, disgusting, evil, alcoholic, and she is the ring leader of the torment. You will absolutely HATE her and want to kill her yourself. I know I did.The last person I want to point out is young David Morgan. He plays David Mache, who befriends Meg and even develops a crush on her. He starts to notice odd things about Ruth and the way she treats Meg. He begins to become uncomfortable with the situation, but he wasn't even ready for what was to come. When he first sees Meg tied up in the basement, he is horrified. Throughout the rest of the movie, he struggles with his own self, trying to distinguish wrong from right. He knows what is happening is so wrong but yet he can't seem to do anything about it. Well he tries to help Meg numerous times, but all are to no avail. You really want to grab him and shake him and say ""JUST TELL SOMEONE!!"" but of course you can't. And in the finale, he lays with Meg in one of the most heart-wrenching scenes I have ever seen. He lays with her and cries as she slowly dies after some words to hi. David Morgan really did a good job. I hope to see him in the future.The main thing that disturbs me about this movie is the kids. It's so disturbing to me that kids so young and even older could commit such horrible acts. It really is a disturbing film and if you are easily disturbed please do not bother with this film. And it is based on a true story once again, which to think about only will lower your faith in humanity. Trust me, this is a super powerful film.10 out of 10 stars",The Girl Next Door
135,b_foore90,disturbing yet well made,7,7 September 2011,"Let me start off by saying I could not watch this film in its entirety more than once. The torture scenes are mind bottling and you could literally feel the pain Megs character was going threw. I go further by giving Blythe Auffarth huge props for her role of Meg, it was very well done. I almost felt like I was gonna regurgitate or faint during the final couple torture scenes as they were too much for me as a man to watch someone barely even a few years younger than I go threw. I really got a sense of relief towards the end as Megs pain and suffering ends when she was finally saved from her aunt and cousins. My only problem with this movie was that nobody really did anything sooner to save her when in reality they could have saved her from her aunt and that it was depressing. Overall it was a good film but i wouldn't recommend watching it more than once. I left this film with a sense that I had learned from witnessing the narrators mistake of not doing something that could have made a difference to save her and feeling a sense of wisdom for my own mistakes when Megs said ""its what you do last that really counts""",The Girl Next Door

It makes no sense for him to care for her and still do nothing to help. He is written in as an audience-viewpoint character, but he seems extraneous. Blanche Baker gives a performance that borders on camp, rather like Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford. I can imagine a frat screening of this movie solely to laugh at Baker. But Blythe Auffarth, in the character based on Sylvia Likens, breaks your heart. She is too old for the role and too upscale--not a waif, as Sylvia certainly was--but she plays with such conviction that these inaccuracies become irrelevant. The film has an up-budget look and is beautifully directed. The director avoids the obvious shift of shooting nothing but dark scenes. The bright colors, however, never seem cheerful. But watch to see Auffarth...you will become her fan. The frame sequence with William Atherton is a development of the sympathetic boy; but Atherton makes it work.

148,GimpsPig,Not the worst movie ever made . . .BUT,4,17 October 2008,"I must admit firstly that it IS rare that a novel makes it to the screen in such unfiltered form as far as dialog and plot goes. Pretty much point for point this movie hits all the most important events and spoken lines from Jack Ketchum's novel, a liberally fictional telling of this true story.No, this film lacks something else entirely. It's called personality. Reading the novel, I felt the environment become darker and dirtier, more angry. I could actually envision the characters get grimier and more erratic. This emotional life of the environs and physical descent of the persons are not nearly as prominent as should have been in the film version. As a result, the aesthetics of this adaptation end up being nothing short of stagnant.And ""stagnant"" is just one of the ""s"" words that can be used to describe the acting. Only Blythe Auffarth's performance as Meg, victim extraordinaire, deserves any praise at all. Although, even here I'm referring to the fact that she's really quite good at screaming, crying and drooling, but not actually delivering any of the few lines required of her.If you've read the book, go into the movie expecting a relatively direct transfer only minus the feeling. Do not expect any further shock value as most of the deeds described in text already made you feel dirty for reading it in the first place, and rightly so, can't be depicted on film. Most importantly, no further meaning or insight to the human condition can be gleaned from the movie that wasn't blatantly obvious in the book.If you haven't read the book, however, then it is possible you may still find yourself squirming in your seat a bit as the subject matter is pretty f-ing disturbing no matter how you tell it.

That being said, I have never ever been this raged induced and mixed with emotion after reaching the end credits. The Girl Next Door is by far one of the most unsettling movies I've had to experience.Prone to my curiosity, I'm known to look for titles that seem to challenge the moral integrity of the viewer. After reviewing a couple of movies that have had a notorious reputation (i.e A Serbian Film, I Spit On Your Grave, etc) this, somewhat casually named, movie appeared in several of the comments. I absolutely love films that are able to bring an onslaught of emotion but this, this was something else.The entire premise just sent a dark shiver down my spine. Growing up in a similar atmosphere, The Girl Next Door implanted a haunting sense of fear in my mind. This is something that could be happening right now. And with all the stories from around the global, is INDEED totally plausible. While trying to maintain my composure through the scenes, I could feel my blood boil. I wanted to tear out my laptop screen and jump right into the action. It was hard to believe that this was still just a movieEmotions aside, I think the child acting was creepily realistic. They all put a great and believable performance. The movie itself was well directed. Overall, this movie is not for everyone. If you have a strong set of moral values, I don't recommend going through this experience.

I'm giving a bad review for the obvious reason: because the story is extremely horrible and sad! NO ONE should EVER abuse anyone!! Watching this movie gave me the worst pain in my stomach because the abuse, physical, mental, and sexual, almost made me sick so bad!! I'm surprised I finished this movie because the abuse starts right out of the gate of the movie because I was hoping Meg would survive at the end of the movie. I'm not incredibly sure, but I think that this story is based on the real life of Sylvia Likens, a 16 year old girl who was abused, starved, and murdered around 1965. The good thing that came out of this story is that her sister, Jenny, survived the horrors of the aunt, or whatever she was. I would love to kill the woman, as well as the kids who beat up Sylvia because that is one of the worst and horrible stories that ever happened! From what I know, the mom of the boys who murdered Sylvia died back in 1990 and THANK GOD SHE'S DEAD!!!! She needed to die for what god-less acts she's committed, as well as her children!!! Only one of her boys, who was released from prison a bit ago, ACTUALLY confessed that what he did was horrible and admits that he was wrong and feels bad for the horrible crime he committed. Whatever happened to those kids, I think almost all of them went to prison from 2-21 years so, that eases the anger and sadness for Sylvia's death. Back to the point of the movie: This movie is incredibly sad, heart-breaking, and stomach-churning that I would advise to never watch but, if anyone can handle the sexual and physical abuse, as well as Meg dying, then good but, I would NEVER watch it again!It was too upsetting and stomach- churning to watch and had me sleeping with every pillow in my bed and put on sleep music to help me sleep that night because it was too scarring and disturbing for me to sleep and I didn't sleep for more then 4 hours and then took a nap later on the next day.

159,GinaisaHorrorFanatic,"A must-see, but certainly not a must-own",8,14 January 2008,"""The Girl Next Door"" was suggested reluctantly to me via my uncle who said that it was one of the two films ever to ""make him feel dirty."" On that note, I had to rent it right away. The movie was surely an experience, but one that I probably will not choose to watch again. This film was incredibly well-made. However, at some points, I felt as if I were watching a Lifetime movie. That was until the torture came about. The movie was made to look like it would in real life, no trick lighting to make it look scarier than it is, and no holding back on the dialogue or the content. This was one of the few movies that completely boggled my mind when it was over. I did not know how to feel about it, and it certainly wasn't like watching a horror movie. Horrible things occurred in it, but I wasn't hoping for blood and gore. This movie is only recommended to those who have a strong stomach and very lax morals. The reasons for its R-rating say it all. It is full of violence, nudity, sexual content and abuse - all involving children. From watching the film, I would assume that it was intended to disturb viewers and inform of the horrors of real-life torture. And, in that, I believe it succeeded.",The Girl Next Door

Watch a vulnerable person tortured then die! I lived through the fifties and sixties. Definitely, not idyllic. Bad things happened and were overlooked. I never write negative reviews. I felt the need to vent my rage about the exploitation. There are quite a few other efforts to address the true events, without making the history worse. I did research the presents of the most of the people involved. Not satisfying. As my title claims, ""No Justice!"".",The Girl Next Door
162,marcdrinkwater,A Harrowing Story,4,12 December 2007,"The beginning of this film immediately spring to mind those, made for TV, true story, movies. Its based on a true story, and the story is pretty horrific.A girl and her disabled sister go to live with a crazy aunt, and her gang of kids, after the death of her parents. What follows is then a sketchy, shallow and mainly illogical portrayal of the senseless torture and abuse suffered by the girl, at the hands of the crazy woman and her sons.The narrator, an unwilling child observer to the abuse, suffers inner turmoil as he watches the horror unfold and only ever in an inept manner can he bring himself to tell anyone about whats happening.Once the premise of the story is set up the viewer is then subject to scene after scene of violent abuse, ever increasing, with little coherence or plot development. There's no explanation for what's happening and little else going on other than set pieces containing the grim deeds of a one dimensional psychopathic aunt.I felt for the victims of the story, and i have to remember that its telling a true tale, but I can't help thinking that if this was the only way to tell this story, then it probably could have been left alone.",The Girl Next Door

This is a gut wrenching horror movie that will leave you breathless, with some scenes that are very hard to watch. I feel that this movie could be compared with the likes of seven and other strong films in the horror genre. I was pleasantly surprised by how well this movie is filmed and how tons of blood and gore do not play a significant roll yet the movie is still suspenseful and scary. The character Ruth and Meg are both wonderfully played In Meg you emphasize and really feel for her. For the character Ruth you really hate, and fear her. This movie truly sets the ton for horror movies. The only thing that kept me from giving this movie a perfect 10 is at sometimes there is a bit of cheesy and weak acting. I strongly recommend this movie its a real horrifying experience.",The Girl Next Door

No other horror movie has truly horrified me before, and I've seen plenty. I'm sure you all know the story by now, so I'll save you that.If you want to watch this movie, I recommend it beyond all belief. However, if you are squeamish, hate horror movies, and can't tolerate any form for torture, stay away from it. Aunt Ruth made her way to the third spot of my Fictional Characters I Never Want to Meet list. Even with how scary it was, I was entranced. I could not look away no matter how hard I tried.

Really big fan of the torture films, however, this is not as gruesome as hostel where you just wanna see bucket loads of blood, this is not like that at all, its hard to describe in words but you do really feel for the victim and want it to end but at the same time you want more, there really are some scenes that are disturbing (the one with the blowtorch springs to mind) but it doesn't show you, which is worse because your mind just goes through all the scenarios.

If nothing happened, you wouldn't watch it.That being said, this is one of the MOST disturbing films I have ever seen. I literally felt physically ill by the end of it. The extreme scenes were almost unbearable to watch, I have to admit, I wasn't expecting feeling like this from a film, but now I am going to have trouble getting to sleep with SUCH GRAPHIC images still fresh on my mind and a sort of ""just got kicked in the gut"" feeling in my stomach.I gave this film 5/10 simply because of the vile subject matter and the unbelievable ""realness"" it presented, in the acting, in the dialog, in the storyline. This film is one of those horrible highway accidents you see on the side of the road, where bodies are bloody and maimed, and you WANT to look away, but you just cant. Well, I just couldn't look away, as much as I wanted to. It kept my interest ONLY in the fact that I wanted to see a happy ending.

167,lemonsaresweet1,Left me feeling mortified,1,14 August 2012,"I find this movie as equally difficult to review as I did to watch - The question I have to ask myself is what do I expect from a movie? In particular, what do I expect when I'm browsing the horror section of my Love Film? Do I expect something original, shocking and that pushes the boundaries of the cliché, Hollywood horror? I believe it fair to say that I do, and undoubtedly this film does do that. Yet, I forget that when I opt to watch any film - regardless of genre - I want to be entertained, if that means scared, saddened, made to laugh or cry. This film made me none - It was NOT entertainment, one does not have to force oneself to sit through entertainment, one does not want to leave the theatre when Jack is dying and you feel the lump in your throat, nor when Liam Neeson is torturing a bad man in Taken - But this film, this film I am thankful to have not seen in a Theatre, for I would not have had the blessing of being able to skip the horrifying scenes unwinding on my screen, that are anything but satisfying (other than to, possibly, disgusting old men who might get off to the entirely torture-p orn nature of this film, a good reason for it to be banned in my opinion) What makes this film so difficult is the lack of explanation and thus the utter lack of understanding or comprehension that you have for what Meg is going through. Why does David not get the police and lead them to Meg? Why does she not run when given the opportunity? As if the actions of Ruth's sons aren't unsettling enough, the actions of the neighbourhood children who eventually participate are even more mind boggling.This film ended with no resolution, no justice, leaving me feeling unfulfilled and quite frankly, mortified after sitting through an hour of what felt like incessant torture. As I said, I cannot put this film into words - I want to make someone that I know watch it so they can comprehend the difficulty of this movie.A one from me, as it is entirely non-enjoyable. Quite the opposite.",The Girl Next Door

Started like a regularly typical childhood recollection story but then quickly unfolded to this beyond hellish nightmare. I literally couldnt bear it and wanted to walk away but I wanted to see justice I guess (which never came!). It actually felt wrong to be watching what happened to this poor girl and her sister. Not sure the purpose of detailing what happened to this degree. Yes, we need to expose such behaviour, however, to present this as a film for entertainment is just wrong. This might have been best served as a documentary. Regardless of the topic, we watch movies for entertainment whether we want to be terrified, educated or humoured etc. This is not a horror, it is though, horrendous. I gave it 4 stars simply for the actors. They pulled it off so well I felt I was in the room (unfortunately). A very chilling performance from one of the main protagonists. However, the ending left questions unanswered and that left me feeling a tad voyeuristic. All in all, wish I hadn't seen it as you can't simply forget what you've seen knowing it actually happened to the poor girl. Will now recall it as the worst film I've ever seen!",The Girl Next Door

My problem with this movie is they glorify the torture that this girl goes through and to be honest this should have never been made into a movie. This should be a documentary of the real failure of CPS, government, and every citizen not saying anything when they see abuse. This story happened 50 years ago but look at Gabriel Hernandez who suffered the same fate, we have to stand up for children because nobody else will. This should also be a wake up call on the justice system, the people that perpetrated these disgusting acts of torture that lead to this girls death were all released from jail serving the minimum sentence.",The Girl Next Door

I literally feel as filthy as the people engaged in the acts portrayed in the film.However, sitting in judgment while watching the torture scenes I find myself drawn into their world because I too want to find the offspring of everyone involved and break every bone in their body and burn their skin and dismember their sexual organs.So obviously we can all be driven to cruelty and somehow feel justified in our feelings. We wonder how societies can turn and things like the Holocaust can happen, how the torture of terror suspects by our own current administration can take place while we all sit idly by.It reminds me of one thing, we are the only animals on this planet capable of torture. No other animal purposely imposes pain-most won't even kill their own species, yet we humans with our philosophies and religions find a way to be so pompous and arrogant to believe we are the master species of the planet. That we deserve some ""afterlife"" or blessing from a creator. If there is an intelligent creator-he/she/it would just set us all ablaze after seeing the things we do.After seeing this I know this for sure, we are the filth of this earth, we are an infestation that does not deserve to live because all of us can turn a blind eye to cruelty to save our own asses. We always seem to find a way to justify cruelty to not only our own kind, but every living thing on this planet.Wow, I feel like a real piece of crap tonight. Just for being human.Is that how this movie was supposed to make me feel? WTF? WTF? WTF? I am sure there is some excuse for that woman like she was raped by her daddy or tortured or whatever, but when bad things happen to you doesn't that make you want to be better than that? I am so mindf**ked by this movie I don't even know what to think.I am going to go vomit now.(I did have to add this)The film was masterfully done. The actors drew me in like I was there. I haven't literally ""talked"" to a screen in years. I did this time. Those actors doing the evil really made me hate them. I don't even know if I could look those actors in the eye without that feeling creeping over me if I ran into them in an airport-that is how engrossed I became in this story. The foster mother in this story plays the role incredibly. I will have nightmares about her face. Those kids were little bastards to a degree that is unbecoming an actor of their ages.The movie is disturbing and believable. Hardly anything left to the imagination. If I had to give it a name to reflect what it was about and the horror it portrayed I would say, ""Nazi-American Family Auschwitz""I did not want to leave my ""vomit"" comment as my opinion of the film itself. The film is really well done, but you feel filthy for watching it.",The Girl Next Door
177,tim-williams-6,Too real to be enjoyable,6,22 March 2010,"I went into this not knowing anything at all. Just a recommendation on the net that it was very disturbing and worth a look. I like films that disturb and shock me. Much like the enjoyment you get form listening to depressing music, such as Radiohead. At first the film seemed quite lightweight. Had the same feel as Stand by Me; a kind of 80s coming of age film, but then gradually turns really nasty, but not in the hostel sense. This film does not have too much blood at all, but the theme is very adult and disturbing. In fact it's quite surprising they allow children to act this type of stuff out. I have to say that although the acting is passable, the violence is realistic, it is just too real feeling to be enjoyable. There are a lot of scenes that are really uncomfortable, which is mainly to do with the age of the children involved. I watched Martyrs recently. Martyrs deeply, deeply disturbed me, more so than this film. However, I loved Martyrs, because it had so may elements to it, and was played in a completely different way. This just felt cheap in comparison to the style of Martyrs. I will however give it 6 because it was trying to tell a true story, and I don't think it was trying to glamorise any of the extreme scenes, but that doesn't make it any more enjoyable.",The Girl Next Door

The plot is very engrossing. Everything about this movie screams unbelievably well done and the makers of it should be extremely proud. This is the first Horror / Thriller were I actually felt for the characters. This is certainly the best film in its genera. This is also the reason why I wouldn't recommend watching it to most people... Watching this gives you a feeling as if you just accidentally killed your pet (worse actually)... It is far more horrifying then anything I have ever seen and the script makes it come to life which makes it even more terrifying....If you are looking for a horror movie and don't have heart problem then watching it should be a priority just expect to feel horrible afterwards...I can't believe this managed to get R rated in USA...

179,nadinecarter,great movie but disturbing.........,10,3 December 2007,I mean it's hard to say that a torture movie is great because it is disturbing to watch. But reality is this happens in our world and it is frightening. It could very well be banned. The acting was great and I was glued to the movie from start to finish. This movie should be watched with caution of being left unsettled and disturbed. Children need not to view this even with adult supervision. I have to admit this movie will stick with me for a very long time. I wonder if anyone has read the book. Books often are more detailed and vivid. I'm a book reader but I don't think I could read this. It would make me have bad dreams I believe. Heck after watching this I might even have a bad dream.,The Girl Next Door
180,pushbuttonick,Offensively Bad,1,11 December 2007,"The Girl Next Door suffers from a boatload of problems, from the very premise  which is exciting if you thought Hostel 2 was too classy  to the acting  which is good if you've never actually met and conversed with live people. This movie is rotten from foundation to rafters, and suffers a series of huge gaps in logic and development, both of which are highly necessary to establish that any of the monstrous caricatures we're forced to watch are anything more than someone's paper-thin excuse for getting their kicks out at 24 frames a second. I know, I know, it's based on a book, so therefore it's somehow loftier than Captivity or Turistas, but those movies actually had something in the way of set design and ambition to set them apart, rotten as they are. The Girl Next Door gives us hasty sketches of a monstrous mother figure who you've no choice but to hate from the word go, kids who fall into a lockstep of torture and abuse for no discernible reason and a washout main character who might as well be wallpaper-colored for all the impact he has as a narrator or character. The setup is brief before the torture porn starts, and from there it's a freefall of implausibility. One day they're fighting in a bedroom, the next they've got a girl bound in the basement, tearing her clothes off, the next they're engaged in kiddie rape, while the Cruella DeVille mom urges things on. Neighborhood kids file in and out, never bothering to mention anything going on to their parents, the main character only seems to get around to caring about what's going on in the last 20 minutes and everything wraps up in a nice neat little bow, complete with a movie-of-the-week moral moment tacked on. I could be snide and say the only good thing about this movie was how short it was, but there is no saving grace to this film. It's just plain ugly. If that's what you're hungry for, by all means, but if you actually enjoy horror films and don't utterly despise every other person on the planet, there are far better options on the shelf.",The Girl Next Door

If you have ever witnessed anything not even 1/100th as bad as this movie, in real life, watching this movie will eat you up with guilt and rightfully so!This movie should be rated 10 by everyone.

This is one of the most gratuitous, exploitive pieces of work to ever come down the pike. I felt very uncomfortable listening to the dialog at times. Even though it's children acting, ie: make believe, I couldn't get my head around the fact that it was real life kids speaking these grossly graphic lines. Scorcesses' Taxi Driver dealt with Jodie Foster's character with greater sensitivity and aplomb. A lost art perhaps?- or just better directing. It seems we need to raise the shock value higher and higher to really disturbing unnecessary heights. God knows where it will end. It's one thing to make a statement or to enlighten the public to the horrendous events that befell this young woman, but this goes beyond the pale. It is nothing short of shameful, and I would argue criminal, to subject child actors to this kind of graphically vulgar script. I pity the children of any one of the makers of this ""film"".

196,thomasmaroulis,Emotionally draining.,9,21 December 2007,"I honestly don't know how to begin characterizing this movie except through the emotions it evoked in me. Watching it left me with a dark, miserable and ultimately empty feeling that I have rarely experienced before. The contrast, between the cheerful and distinctly innocent scenes at the beginning of the film and the quiet horror that follows, leaves one feeling emotionally spent, but the most frightening aspect of the film is the utter calm of the torture scenes. Rarely, if indeed ever, will one hear shouting and everything seems to move at a deliberately slow pace, that helps the images sink in and eventually helps breed hate for the perverse and demented character of Ruth. The entire concept is so exaggerated, that had not something similar occurred to Sylvia Likens in 1965, I would have dismissed it as overstated and detached from reality.I did not enjoy watching this film. That, in itself, would have been a contradiction in terms. Yet I do not regret it either. I do recommend it to anyone who feels equipped to handle the strain, as it, through the extreme example, provides valuable insight into the world of child abuse.",The Girl Next Door

The casting was poor, acting laughable (especially Blythe as 14-yr-old Meg-- she looked every bit her 20 years and was amateur at best), dialog stupid and the David character a frustrating farce. Nobody decent (as David's character was supposed to be) would stand around for as long as he did and not tell his parents or somebody! And the neighbors were so clueless in this small town (where scandal and gossip is usually welcome amid the boredom) that they were unaware that the drunkard single mom on the block (divorced moms were suspect back then, too) was feeding alcohol to their own kids and raising a brood of bully, violent brats? Completely NON believable.And I doubt a little guy like David would be able to off a maniacal, adult woman w/ two swings of a crutch!It's a shame that the opportunity to bring this excruciatingly sad, yet important story about child abuse to the world via film was squandered so miserably.",The Girl Next Door

The old woman burns ""F--k me"" on the girl's skin, and burns her lady parts with a blow torch. The police arrives and the girl dies. The end.It is a well made movie, and the not-torture-porn parts are even enjoyable, but it could have been a lot better if it focused more on the psychological part of the torture rather than the cheap Hostel style crap it ends up with.And the whole ""witness that doesn't report the crime"" has been made over and over, so it is not even original.",The Girl Next Door
203,pegl,A film of rare pedigree bound to acquire cult status,9,27 August 2007,"My preliminary research into this adaptation of a tale of demented human cruelty had me primed to expect a grueling viewing experience, if only I could be sure I would make it to the UK premier screening. But it was looking as if London's Tubes were against me. Time was ticking by, and the announcement of a fire alert at Hyde Park Corner only served to induce a fierce sense of frustration in me. Deciding to change lines, I quickly scrambled up the escalators at South Kensington, switching to the Circle and District Lines that could take me to Embankment, from where it was only a quick sprint up the Northern Line to the Leicester Square tube station- a mere stone's throw away from my final Fright Fest destination. As I hurriedly took my seat in a darkened auditorium, I wiped the sweat from my brow and settled down to the narration of David, a 50+ man remembering a painful past. I had made it, but only just. 'Brace yourself' I thought, my journey into torture and child abuse was about to begin...Obviously haunted by a series of traumatic past incidents and his own conflicted involvement, his monologue of regret quickly segues into a vivid portrayal of an idyllic 1950s US suburbia, or so it would seem. As in David Lynch's 'Blue Velvet', the viewer realises that still waters run deep, that all will not be as it seems, making the anticipated revelation all the more shocking. In 'The Girl Next Door' we are waiting for this idyll of childhood innocence to be shattered-after all, it has haunted our narrator for nigh on 50 years! Aware that forthcoming scenes had led to some instances of horrified audience walkouts, I took whatever solace I could in this preliminary scene-setting, desperately hoping that young David's first foray down into the basement would be a mere tease from the filmmakers.At first the young David seems like a lucky fellow-playing games with local friends, drinking beer next door at his neighbour's place, and meeting Meg, a lovely young lass who is adjusting to a new life at Auntie Ruth's house with her caliper-splint wearing sister after losing her parents in an automobile accident. Ruth's sons aren't quite so likable however- they enjoy watching ants devour worms. It could just be harmless childhood curiosity, but as it happens, it serves to augur something far worse. Similarly, Ruth's dispensing of beer to underage kids might also be written off as relatively harmless, but again it serves to signal the potential for something else. We begin to realise that something scary lurks behind that smile and all that hospitality. Ruth's perspective on the world is subtly skewed. Ultimately, she resents her lonely, man-less predicament, burdened by three sons, and holds neither the male nor the female sex in high regard.It's here that 'The Girl Next Door' displays a remarkable economy of storytelling- a few key actions and utterances are all that is required to create a set of fully realised and psychologically plausible characters by which a remarkable set of occurrences are made credible. Full credit has to go the scripting, the casting and the acting. Lesser films with more generous budgets would require 2 hours to achieve what 'The Girl Next Door' manages in only one-and-a-half. The pacing is also remarkable- by the time Meg has been imprisoned in the basement and 'the game' has begun, we have become unwilling but necessary witnesses of a despicable crime, uncertain as to the precise point at which the line was irrevocably crossed. So many otherwise innocent children have come under Ruth's sway, observing and engaging in acts they would never normally countenance, and it doesn't even seem remarkable, merely plausible.This is no mere sensationalist exercise in exploitation. As painful as it may be to become party to David's anguish and Meg's suffering, our identification with their plight provides the only tolerable way to participate in the witnessing of a crime that's all the more shocking because something so very similar really happened. Without its basis in veracity it might not even be justifiable as anything but perverse voyeurism. And this is why this film will be remembered. I anticipate a chain of Chinese whispers according this a deserved notoriety, assuring 'The Girl Next Door' a special place in film history alongside such shocking and cautionary works as 'Peeping Tom', 'A Clockwork Orange', and '10 Rillington Place'. Like all of these films, 'The Girl Next Door' is profoundly disturbing, not for its visceral content, but for the psychological implications of its characters' actions. After branding Meg's belly with derogatory expletives and then lighting a blow torch (at which point a member of the audience vacated the cinema), you know Ruth has gone beyond sanity, beyond any hope of an existence that can ever escape the mental ramifications of her sadism. Once Meg's suffering had concluded and Ruth's evil had been extinguished, I emerged from the cinema tear stricken. Anger, repulsion and pity may have been pulsing through my guts, but my spirit was celebrating the power of cinema. I will be forever touched by the atrocity this film forced me to confront. 'The Girl Next Door' is a film of rare pedigree.",The Girl Next Door
204,gqviet510,Pushes it genre to the limit,10,30 November 2007,"Its been a really really long time since I seen a movie this intensely horrifying. This is the type of movie that starts off soft and ends at the climax, leaving viewers breathlessly shocked. I have never before seen children ages probably ranging between 8-13 commit the inhumane acts as seen in this movie. The boy children were given permission by their sick twisted foster mother to torture a beautiful innocent girl. As the torture worsen you feel more and more sympathy for the girl; this is what makes the movie excellent because it captures the audience in a very powerful way. To make this movie even more horrifying is realizing the movie is based on a true story. I would not recommend anyone to watch this movie before they go to bed because it will be hard to sleep having to think about the poor girl being tortured. I have a feeling this movie will be banned because its too explicit for the general public to watch.",The Girl Next Door

She has a younger sister disabled by the accident and both of them are now under care of foster parents, its is a family of boys with their sadist mother who torture her and at the end kill her. Though the film is adapted well and the director succeeds in portraying a true story, this film has no entertainment value.

207,panicprod,Unflinchingly real ... a genre-redefining classic,10,6 December 2007,"Directed by Gregory Wilson, and shot and produced by William Miller, Jack Ketchum's The Girl Next Door is a movie that few who've seen it will ever forget. Black-hole dark and beyond harrowing, it's nonetheless a carefully crafted work and also extraordinarily sensitive. In fact, if it's not strictly a horror film, then one can only conclude that it's the genre's loss. Jack Ketchum's novel, like much of his work, is based on compelling real-life events. In this instance the story draws upon a 1960s case of almost unspeakable child abusemost of that abuse committed by other children under adult supervision. Ketchum, who is extremely proud of this film adaptation, speaks openly about production company Moderncine's initial pitch to him: ""Let us make this movie before Hollywood does and ruins it."" To bring The Girl Next Door to the screen, Moderncine enlisted some topnotch talent, including award-winning director Gregory Wilson, who here displays a tremendous talent working with actors, and veteran writers Philip Nutman and Daniel Farrands. Still, in a period when horror movies have repeatedly pushed, and even mangled, the envelope, this one derives most of its emotional shock not from graphic content but from the realistic and courageous presentation of a long-standing cultural taboo: on-screen violence to children. Unfortunately, it's all too easy for mainstream critics to shoot down this kind of movie by terming it ""exploitative"" when actually it's the opposite: a tragedy that immerses the audience in the misery of the real rather than promoting escapism with comfortable, and clichéd, lessons about violence and evil. After a successful theatrical run in New York early in the fall, The Girl Next Door is now available here on DVD. I urge you to see it. Like another powerful film released in 2007, Bug, it may hit too close to home to appeal to the typical horror fan. Indeed, it has a slightly different audience in mind: human beings.",The Girl Next Door
208,samanthahill87,TORTURE PORN - absolutely disgusting movie,1,12 December 2007,"This movie was shocking in its perverted exploitation of a teenage girl and her disabled younger sister (who's parents have died), by their twisted aunt and her disturbed sons. The movie gives no reasons for the aunts twisted behaviour nor does it explain why a neighbourhood full of children who visit the house whilst this poor girl is strung up, raped, beaten, genitally mutilated, and starved, say nothing at all despite the story being set in a 1950's world where such events were not heard of even in the movies. Furthermore the movie does not justify why these children participate in unbelievable levels of abuse before running off to play out with their ice-creams and trikes - it just doesn't make any sense. It goes no way to explain why the main character Davey is aware from the start that something is seriously wrong, yet fails to do anything at all to help the girl as the level of abuse rapidly moves from overly-intimate tickling to violent, bloody, perverted, shocking rape, until the last few minutes of the film. If Davey had said something earlier the abuse would not have reached the level it did and it is wholly inexplicable and unreasonable for the movie to expect viewers to swallow the concept that Davey would not have said anything to anyone. This movie strikes as another in a long line of torture-porn movies made solely for twisted individuals who enjoy watching a very attractive and intelligent teenage girl gradually beaten down and controlled with increasingly sickening and frightening abuse during which she is raped by young teenage boys who are watched by their mother who also seems to gain sexual pleasure from spanking the much younger sister. This movie is wrong and sick and will do nothing more than encourage the sick perversions of those very real and very dangerous people in our society who fantasise about this sort of thing. I strongly advise you do not watch this movie, at the very least out of protest that the kind of violent porn that is illegal has somehow made it into our mainstream media.",The Girl Next Door

From the start of the move till the end, you are keep awake and anciently waiting to see the outcome to this horrifying event. It is sad to know that such abuse is an on going tragic scene that happens everyday. The only way to prevent such coward act is to educate ourself and others of the effect toward the victim, their life and family. No one should suffer the burden of other mistake.It's clear why this movie did not get the attention is deserved. The media does not care much about the truth nor does it see much revenue they will gain from the public.

You can't be serious?There were so many chances for her to get away, but no she couldn't because the director wanted to drag out the plot, and it only made the movie more unrealistic and silly to be honest.I watched the movie with an open mind. I also never heard of the actors/actresses in it either and only found it by sheer luck because the synopsis caught my attention.The only thing I feel is anger. I'm angry at how she was treated and it scares me because I know stuff like this happened in the past and is probably happening somewhere right now in this world.Anyways, in my opinion this film wasn't as good as I hoped it would be even though the first 1/4 of the film was good. The film had a lot of potential, but it just spiralled downward after 25 minutes.Just imagine seeing a scene and knowing that only one thing needs to happen in order for the whole movie to end, but some outside force, some freak of nature that can bend the laws of physics prevents that from happening.Well, that's pretty much what's going to happen from 2/4 of the movie until the very end.Wouldn't recommend it.",The Girl Next Door

I think the fact that is was set in the fifties made it even more disturbing. The fifties are a time in history that we think of as being wholesome and the atrocities that occurred in the movie cause a clash with this notion. I am sure that things like this and even much worst occurred then although nobody talked about it.

Frankly, I do not care whether it is shot well and/or has good acting. What it boils down to for movies like this is whether they are more shocking and violate more, or more sensitive, taboos of society than the ""average"" horror flick. ""The Girl next door"" managed to do exactly this. We are shown horrible atrocities in a way they were not depicted before. Therefore the ""aficionado"" of the genre will shout hooray and deem it a good horror movie. But did you ever think through where this road will lead in the long run? To shock you even more, there will some day be a film showing the same kind of horrifying events but depicting it even more drastically (one of the two stars is for holding back at least some of the gruesome stuff from the camera)... This is happening for virtually any aspect of brutality or cruelty on the market. And the moment one sadistic theme is exploited until it hits the mainstream road, someone will come up with breaking yet another taboo. And so forth... I do like horror as a genre and think of myself as having a strong stomach, even for really tough stuff. But all those recent slasher, torture and abuse movies do not leave me horrified, but plain angry about the time I wasted for yet having given one of them another chance. Why don't people get it? It's just the very same scheme time and time again: The biggest monsters are humans themselves, watch yet another thing more deprived than before!This is lame and utterly uncreative! I really hope that some day people will be saturated with this kind of movies (anyway there will be a movie showing ""it all"" in the end, according to my predictions) and film makers will finally be forced to invent creative new ways of wearing our nerves down.",The Girl Next Door
214,oldgentlovecraft,A Disturbing Portrayal of Abuse,10,20 January 2008,"Jack Ketchum's The Girl Next Door was one of only three books that I have ever had trouble reading and as a true fan of the horror genre that says a lot. However, that's what good writing is meant to do: make you feel, think and fear along with the characters.The movie is an excellent adaptation of Ketchum's story of abuse and slow building dread as the supposed parental figure comes unraveled and results in the degradation of two young girls that borders on unbearable. What makes the movie (and the book) so difficult to bear witness to isn't the content but the realism. Movies like Saw and Hostel depict scenes of torture that have pushed the limits of modern cinema but a film such as The Girl Next Door packs its punch by using ""innocent"" children as the key players and by making the viewer feel like a voyeur of an act that he/she shouldn't be watching. Also, it's based on a true story which just reminds us all of the true evil that people can commit.All in all if you aren't numb to violence in movies and can put yourself in any of the characters' places this is a good example of a movie that isn't afraid to show the raw manifestation of human nature at its darkest.",The Girl Next Door
215,klompenator,Too intense for an R-Rating-,5,4 February 2008,"I gave this film a low rating because it was so awful in it;s graphic content, and so shameful, that I felt guilty for watching it through. I kept thinking the girl would be saved, and was so aching in my heart for her and her sister, that it shook me up for days after watching the film. The thing that bothered me most, besides the fact that there are psychopathic women haters out there that really do this sort of thing, was that so many people became ""contrivers"", either by getting directly involved or doing nothing to help the victim.; I was also very bothered by the fact that this movie was rated R, because for all the violence , and sexual abuse , it should have been rated NC-17, at the very least. I think movies that have this kind of detailed cruelty, especially involving children and sexuality,, warrant not only a rating that is more restrictive, but also more warnings on the label to let viewers know exactly what they are in for. Movie stores can also play an active role in informing the public, even if those rating a film fail to do so.. Hope you are careful to not watch this with anyone under 17, and I would even suggest reading the book instead, to prevent unsettling visual images from reminding you all day how evil people can be.",The Girl Next Door

This was not that type of movie and I am upset that it was on this station even though it is one of the most horrifying movies out there. And it's based on true facts. Throughout this movie my thoughts kept going to the book ""A Child Called It""--also true. I'm writing this at 4 a.m. because after watching this show, I can't sleep. Although I wouldn't have picked this show to watch, now that I have seen it I realize the importance of our world not EVER forgetting that this can and does happen. People know about it but don't want to admit it or ""pry"". Even though, in 2009, we'd like to believe the neighbors, CPS or the police would step in, I fear that is not the truth.

Although I have never read Jack Ketchum the idea of even writing or filming a story of this nature is revolting!Torture against children is a serious and horrible issue that should be made aware of but this movie is beyond educating people about abuse.But the most upsetting thing in this film is the fact that children were used in the film doing and saying things that no parent should allow.Unfortunately money seemed more enticing to the parents which is an abuse itself! How any person could even let their child pretend to abuse another child in this way is disgusting!!!

However, I don't recommend anyone should see this film. In fact I think it should be illegal in the U.S. I heard a 4th grader say yesterday that they've seen all the Saw movies.

Ruth and Meg are the two focus points in this movie and they both play their roles perfectly.I will not give away too much of the roles for these characters, as no matter how many good reviews there are on here, you yourself will have to go on the journey with them to actually understand the magnitude of this movie.Once i finished this movie the feelings that i was left with were of anger and sadness. A movie that leaves the viewers with lasting feelings and emotions has truly done its job. Child abuse is a very serious subject, that the director of this movie has portrayed really well. There aren't any graphic scene's in the one i watched but it has a deeper impact due to that.I would like to say if you are reading this review and are contemplating viewing it, please do.

It was just more conformation of how disgusting this world we live in can be. I wouldn't tell someone not to watch it, but I would definitely warn them it is not for everyone! I don't particularly care to see it again myself.The overall quality of the film however, was favorable. As for the acting, I would say most of the cast did a commendable job portraying their characters.

My thoughts while watching it were that whoever made it should be deeply ashamed and haunted by the outrage they have committed. And that is my tempered opinion. It is simply a torture film -- as bad as a snuff film in its horrific and ultimate violation of this young woman's body. It will of course appeal to misogynist sociopaths in a very prurient way. And that is about all. It is completely pointless in every other way. There is not even a resolution nor a reckoning for any of the characters' hideous deeds, many of which were apparently sociopathic youngsters, in addition to their adult ringleader.

243,arisiathegreat,It gives you nothing but nightmares,3,19 July 2018,"If you want to watch a movie where the only feeling you'll be left with is ""why did i watch this?"". There is no justice, no reason for the torture you'll be watching. No end credits with quotes about the story the movie is based on, no links to websites handling child abuse. It literally gives you nothing. To be completely honest I felt violated after watching this movie.You will follow the torture of a girl brought on by her aunt and her devil children. Even though the actress was 20 at the time, she does look earily young and does a great job acting, I will certainly give her that. 
Believe it or not, but children are capeable for empathy from a very young age. They are not small monsters with no regard for other humans, and do -not- become psycopaths that easily. I know this movie is from the 60's, and yes both womens stand in society and childrens upbringing was different than it is today, but I simply don't buy that a child (with the moral character he is given) would look at the torture of that young girl and not tell somebody. That he wouldn't walk around with a pit in his stomach, have trouble sleeping and even wet the bed at night - and I do not believe that his mother or his father would not have noticed this change in behaviour.And then there is the reasoning behind this torture and hatred for these two young girls by their aunt. There is no backstory, nothing that gives you any reason why someone would act like that. Yes, I know some people are insane without any reason, but would no one have noticed her psycopathic tendencies before this event? She is watching her boys rape a young girl, encouraging them to torture her and violate her, and what do you get by the very end of the movie, other than her dying a quick death (by getting hit in the head with a crutch). I only watched this movie to the end because I hoped to see something of the trial, of the neighbours reacting with schock by having noticed nothing of this. Something that would give the young girl who died a sense of justice, but nothing happens. The end credits hit the screen and I was left with a feeling of senselessness.

I WOULDN'T EVEN RECOMMEND READING THE PLOT.I'm giving this movie a 1 star not because it's based on a horrible crime or because it's ""disturbing,"" but because it *ADDS* a very unnecessary sexual rape scene involving actors portraying minors (indeed, the actor doing the ""raping"" WAS a minor in real life when this film was made). The only sexual crime I'm aware of that was actually done to Sylvia Likens is being kicked in the crotch and being made to insert a bottle in her vaginal area. She wasn't raped, at least from everything I've read, and as far as I'm aware she didn't have a clitorectomy. The rape by the underage boy was added in this movie (and in the book), and so was the blowtorch torture scene (it was a hot poker instead of a blowtorch in the book, so I hear). Apparently the book author, movie director, and screenwriter thought it was necessary to add the rape by an underage boy and over-the-top sexual torture to an underage girl character to the real crime that happened?! Why?! And did Sylvia Likens' family receive ANY of the proceeds from Ketchum's book or this film? Or the ""An American Crime"" film for that matter? Did they even give permission for these works to be made about (or ""based on/inspired by"") the crime done to Sylvia?

It will not only waste an hour and a half of precious time, which you will never get back. But it will also leave you wanting to punch the wall until your knuckles bleed. Anyone who rated this over 2 stars is clearly a troll trying to ruin your movie night. Where do I begin? The acting was worse than that of a third grade school play. I have no idea where they found these actors but none of them showed a single genuine emotion during the entirety of the film. The way the dialogue was written was even worse, if possible, and every line seemed rehearsed an unnatural. On top of that, the actions of the characters made no sense what so ever. Imagine how irritated you get when a character does something completely foolish in a bad horror movie. That's what this movie does to you, but way worse and all the way through to the end. The story might have been an okay one, yet it was completely slaughtered by how badly the movie was executed. Now you may brush this review off saying I just don't know what I'm talking about, and I can admit that I'm not in any way a professional movie critic. But I love watching movies and I've seen almost a thousand films in my lifetime. This is the single worst one of all of them, including the ones my classmates made in high school with a cheap camera as some half-ass school project. Some bad movies can be charming and entertaining in their own way, or even funny due to how badly made they are. Not this one though. It's as if the director had never even watched a film before making this one, and no one on the set was brave enough to tell him how awful it was going to turn out.I'm glad I got to get this off my chest cause this movie made me so angry that it literally ruined my night.

This is a ""horror"" movie? Really? It was actually made to be watched by people and enjoyed in some way? .I get that people have a dark side, that we're fascinated with the concept of horror and pain, and sometimes can't pull ourselves away from watching it. After all, it's just a movie...Watching something like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or even a psycho thriller like Rosemary's Baby, OK, that's fine. It's messed up stuff, but the ""bad guys"" are clearly just film characters, something someone made up (I don't care how much they plaster ""based on a true story"" across the Chainsaw Massacre - they took INCREDIBLE historical and artistic licenses in its production).Leatherface was left in a dumpster at birth, had a degenerative facial disease that caused his face to...well, fall off, and was made fun of his entire life. Harsh. As for Rosemary's Baby, well, we all know the Devil is the incarnation of evil...And the woman in this film? She was depressed, had some bad marriages under her belt, and too many kids to show for it. In other words, she could easily be a real woman.Wait, that's right - she is. Her real name is Gertrude Baniszewski, and she really did torture and beat a girl to death in her basement with the help of her children (and one of her daughter's boyfriends). I don't care how depressed you are, that is just sick.So congratulations to the filmmakers: you have chosen to make a movie, for entertainment and possibly profit, based on the real murder of a real young girl by some messed up woman and a bunch of kids. That's so great. I'm sure that Sylvia Likens, the girl who was actually tortured to death, is glad her story will live on in our memories, and that people will pay to see it.Some closing facts: No, I did not pay to see this film, nor did I choose to sit through to the end. And yes, I know how the film ends. Allow me to quote the last line, as the main character sits thoughtfully by the river he met ""Meg Laughlin"" (aka Sylvia Likens) on so many years before: ""I will never forget the gift of Meg Laughlin, though I am plagued with the torment of failing again...failing somebody...But as she taught me, it's what you do last that counts."" Uh-huh, of course she taught you that.You tried to find something positive about the situation, writers, good job.

She entered pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity.On May 19, 1966, a jury found Baniszewski guilty of first-degree murder while Paula Baniszewski was found guilty of second-degree murder. Hobbs, along with Baniszewski's son John and another neighbourhood boy, Coy Hubbard, were convicted of manslaughter. Gertrude and Paula Baniszewski were sentenced to life terms at the Indiana Women's Prison in Indianapolis. The boys were sentenced to two-to-21-year terms at the Indiana State Reformatory in Pendleton.In 1971, the Indiana Supreme Court granted Gertrude and Paula Baniszewski a new trial due to ""prejudicial atmosphere"", but Gertrude was again convicted of first-degree murder on Aug. 5, 1971. Paula pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter and served about two years in prison. The three boys were released on parole for good behavior in 1968, after serving about two years each of their sentences.In September 1985, Gertrude Baniszewski was released on parole. She changed her name to Nadine Van Fossan and moved to Iowa where she lived in obscurity until her death from lung cancer on June 16, 1990. Paula married and moved to a farm in Iowa.

This movie is not that graphic but very disturbing, mostly because it is somewhat based on a true story, but also because the movie was just relentless...my heart was pounding through the whole thing and many scenes made me squirm. Some people say the acting was bad with the exception of Ruth, but her acting was really the cornerstone of the film and the few other adults and kids' acting didn't actively hurt the movie's impact for me. Also, I could have done without the flashback format, especially the cheesy part at the end. That did feel a little TV movie-ish, but the bulk of the film was definitely next level.Anyway, I would not call this a horror film, which is the way that it is portrayed on the DVD cover and the reason I checked it out in the first place, although I don't have a better genre to place it in. I don't know if I'm really glad that I saw it, because it was so upsetting, but it did certainly make me feel something, which I think is one of the most important elements of a good movie.",The Girl Next Door
